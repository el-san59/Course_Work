  ".W": "Free radical-mediated oxidative damage has been implicated in tissue injury resulting from ischemia/reperfusion events. Global cortical ischemia/reperfusion injury to Mongolian gerbil brains was produced by transient occlusion of both common carotid arteries. Protein oxidation, as measured by protein carbonyl content, increased significantly during the reperfusion phase that followed 10 min of ischemia. The activity of glutamine synthetase, an enzyme known to be inactivated by metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions, decreased to 65% of control levels after 2 hr of reperfusion that followed 10 min of ischemia. We also report that the free radical spin trap N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone [300 mg/kg (body weight)] administered 60 min before ischemia/reperfusion is initiated, partially prevents protein oxidation and protects from loss of glutamine synthetase activity. In addition, we report a N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone-dependent nitroxide radical obtained in the lipid fraction of the ischemia/reperfusion-lesioned brains, but there was very little radical present in the comparable sham-operated control brains. These data strengthen the previous observation utilizing in vivo-trapping methods, that free radical flux is increased during the reperfusion phase of the ischemia-lesioned gerbil brain. The loss of glutamine synthetase would be expected to increase the levels of brain L-glutamate. Thus, the oxidative inactivation of glutamine synthetase may be a critical factor in the neurotoxicity produced after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.\r"

Unfortunately, the amounts of alpha 1 AT that would be required for replacement therapy are beyond the capacity of plasma fractionation and mammalian cell culture systems. Thus, we have examined the potential of transgenic animals as an alternative means of producing human alpha 1 AT. A hybrid gene constructed by using sequences from the ovine milk protein gene beta-lactoglobulin fused to an alpha 1 AT \"minigene\" was used to generate transgenic mice. Of 13 independent transgenic mice and mouse lines, 5 expressed the hybrid gene in the mammary gland, 5 in the salivary glands, and 2 in both these tissues. Human alpha 1 AT was secreted into the milk of each of the 7 mice and mouse lines that expressed the hybrid gene in the mammary gland. Four of these mammary-expressing transgenic mice and mouse lines produced concentrations of at least 0.5 mg of alpha 1 AT per ml in their milk; one line (AATB 35) produced 7 mg of this protein per ml. alpha 1 AT from transgenic mouse milk was similar in size to human plasma-derived alpha 1 AT and showed a similar capacity to inhibit trypsin. Expression at equivalent levels in transgenic sheep or cattle would yield sufficient alpha 1 AT for therapeutic purposes.\r"

  ".U": "90311368\r", 
  ".W": "Aggregation of human washed platelets with collagen is accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in cyclic GMP but not cyclic AMP. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine (L-MeArg), a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis from L-arginine, reduces this increase and enhances aggregation. L-Arginine, which has no effect on the basal levels of cyclic GMP, augments the increase in this nucleotide induced by collagen and also inhibits aggregation. Both of these effects of L-arginine are attenuated by L-MeArg. The anti-aggregatory action of L-arginine is potentiated by prostacyclin and by M&B22948, a selective inhibitor of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, but not by HL725, a selective inhibitor of the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. L-Arginine also inhibits platelet aggregation in whole blood in a similar manner, although the concentrations required are considerably higher. L-Arginine stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase and increases cyclic GMP in platelet cytosol. This stimulation is dependent on NADPH and Ca2+ and is associated with the formation of NO. Both the formation of NO and the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase induced by L-arginine are enantiomer specific and abolished by L-MeArg. Thus, human platelets contain an NO synthase which is activated when platelets are stimulated. The consequent generation of NO modulates platelet reactivity by increasing cyclic GMP. Changes in the activity of this pathway in platelets may have physiological, pathophysiological, and therapeutic significance.\r"

The predicted size of chicken alpha-fibrinogen is 54,187 daltons, which is the smallest of any alpha chain reported; the oligopeptide repeats that characterize the central regions of the other alpha subunits were conspicuously absent. A further unexpected finding was the presence on the mRNA of a separate, long open reading frame (752 nucleotides), beginning 312 nucleotides downstream from the alpha-fibrinogen coding sequence and containing intron-like features near its 5' end. The protein sequence predicted from this second open reading frame lacks an initiating methionine but is homologous to the C-terminal regions of all known beta- and gamma-fibrinogens as well as the C termini of two nonfibrinogen proteins: cytotactin (tenascin), an extracellular matrix protein, and pT49, a putative protein specific to cytotoxic T cells. The intron-like features of the second open reading frame immediately precede the region of common homology, and the beginnings of the corresponding homologous segments in the beta- and gamma-fibrinogen sequences are marked by aligned intron positions. Based on these findings, it is proposed that fibrinogen gene evolution included a fusion of two distinct ancestral genes.\r"

Its amino acid sequence was obtained by analysis of fragments from cyanogen bromide digestion and by sequencing cDNA clones from two sea urchin testis libraries. TCK contains three complete but nonidentical creatine kinase segments joined by regions of sequence that are not creatine kinase-like and flanked by unique amino and carboxyl termini. Each creatine kinase segment is homologous to vertebrate creatine kinases of both muscle and brain types, and all three repeats contain the essential active-site cysteine. The sequence differences among repeats suggest an ancient gene triplication, around the time of the chordate-echinoderm divergence. The echinoderm, with a unique creatine kinase in sperm, arginine kinase in eggs, and both phosphagen kinases in somatic cells, may represent a preserved branch point in evolution, and TCK may be a relic of this event.\r"

Fourier analysis of electron micrographs of spectrin reveals that the alpha and beta subunits are twisted about a common axis, forming a two-start helix with twofold rotational symmetry. We propose that elastic deformation of the cell is mediated by transient extension of the helix by mechanical forces.\r"

To determine whether these proteins can be reconstituted from their separated subunits into ostensibly native molecules in the absence of added peptides, we denatured a purified human MHC-I protein (HLA-A2) with 4 M NaSCN, separated its heavy (alpha) and light (beta 2-microglobulin) chains by gel filtration, and then mixed them in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of beta 2-microglobulin and absence of added peptides. The reconstituted protein, recovered in 10% yield, was indistinguishable from native A2 in its reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (BB7.7) and its ability to specifically activate A2-specific CD8+ T cells. Inasmuch as the reconstituted A2 contained no detectable peptide adducts (we estimate less than 1 per 100 on a molar basis, assuming peptides of 2-5 kDa), the results suggest that peptide-free A2 can be recognized by CD8+ T cells and that peptide adducts are not essential for the MHC-I protein to maintain an ostensibly native structure.\r"

  ".U": "90311373\r", 
  ".W": "A state of T-cell activation, reflected by a marked degree of spontaneous proliferation in vitro, exists among patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) but not in those with retroviral-induced adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). We wished to define the mechanism by which the immune activation of circulating cells from HAM/TSP is driven, thus gaining insight into the pathogenesis of this HTLV-I-associated disease. By using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction, we compared the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) mRNA expression to the transcription of the HTLV-I transactivator gene, pX, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HAM/TSP and ATL patients as well as seropositive carriers. Up-regulation of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha transcripts was detected in HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers that paralleled the coordinate mRNA expression of the pX transactivator. In addition, IL-2 and soluble IL-2R alpha serum levels in HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers were elevated. Despite markedly elevated levels of soluble IL-2R alpha in ATL, transcripts for IL-2 and pX were not demonstrable in the circulating cells. Finally, the marked degree of in vitro spontaneous proliferation present in HAM/TSP was profoundly inhibited by specific anti-IL-2R or anti-IL-2 blocking antibodies. Collectively, these results suggest that immune activation in HAM/TSP, in contrast to ATL, is virally driven by the transactivation and coordinate expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha. This deregulated autocrine process may contribute to the evolution of inflammatory nervous system damage in HAM/TSP.\r"

By analogy with living platyrrhines, these data suggest that Notharctus venticolus may have lived in polygynous social groups characterized by a relatively high level of intermale competition for mates and other limited resources. The anatomy of the upper incisors and related evidence imply that Notharctus is not as closely related to extant lemuriform primates as has been recently proposed. The early Eocene evidence for canine sexual dimorphism reported here, and its occurrence in a nonanthropoid, indicates that in the order Primates such a condition is either primitive or evolved independently more than once.\r"

A radiopaque lead oxide mixture was injected, and the integument and deep tissues were dissected and radiographed. The sites of the venous perforators were plotted and traced to their underlying parent veins that accompany the source (segmental) arteries. A series of cross-sectional studies were made in one subject to illustrate the course of the perforators between the integument and the deep tissues. The veins were dissected under magnification to identify the site and orientation of the valves. Results revealed a large number of valveless (oscillating) veins within the integument and deep tissues that link adjacent valved venous territories and allow equilibration of flow and pressure throughout the tissue. Where choke arteries define the arterial territories, they are matched by boundaries of oscillating veins in the venous studies. The venous architecture is a continuous network of arcades that follow the connective-tissue framework of the body. The veins converge from mobile to fixed areas, and they \"hitchhike\" with nerves. The venous drainage mirrors the arterial supply in the deep tissues and in most areas of the integument in the head, neck, and torso. In the limbs, the stellate pattern of the venous perforators is modified by longitudinal channels in the subdermal network. However, when an island flap is raised, these longitudinal channels are disconnected, and once again the arterial and venous patterns match. Our venous studies add strength to the angiosome concept. Where source arteries supply a composite block of tissue, we have demonstrated radiologically and by microdissection that the branches of these arteries are accompanied by veins that drain in the opposite direction and return to the same locus. Hence each angiosome consists of matching arteriosomes and venosomes. The clinical implications of these results are discussed with particular reference to the design of flaps, the delay phenomenon, venous free flaps, the pathogenesis of flap necrosis, the \"muscle pump,\" varicose veins, and venous ulceration.\r"

The clinical records of 10 children (4 males and 6 females) who received 4500 to 6500 rads (mean 5160 rads) of craniofacial radiation between birth and 8 years of age (mean 5 years) and who subsequently had reconstructive surgery were reviewed. Six of the 10 patients received orbital radiation, 3 received maxillary-midfacial radiation, and 1 patient underwent radiation to the frontal bone. Histologic tumor types included retinoblastoma (4), rhabdomyosarcoma (3), Ewing's sarcoma (2), and neurofibrosarcoma (1). In addition to radiation, 7 of the 10 patients underwent surgical resection or debulking of their tumors and 6 received adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients presented from 4 to 20 years after treatment (mean 10 years) with varying, but severe degrees of soft-tissue and bony hypoplasia of the irradiated territories. Onlay bone grafting with soft-tissue reconstruction by a combination of local pedicle flaps and dermal-fat grafts was initially performed in 9 patients, and an occipitoparietal bone-flap switch procedure was done in 1 patient. Late follow-up ranged from 11 months to 7.5 years (mean 34 months). A total of 8 secondary procedures were necessary in 4 of the 10 patients (40 percent). Of these 4 patients, major revisions were performed in 3 and minor adjustments in 1. In addition, 2 patients in whom secondary procedures had not been done would benefit from further reconstruction. Therapy for cancer of the head and face during childhood has profound and ongoing effects on the growth of soft tissue and bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to define clinical and radiographic features in these patients that are associated with a poor prognosis, which in turn might influence the timing of facial fracture repair. The presence of an upper-level facial fracture, low Glasgow coma score, intracranial hemorrhage, displacement of normally midline cerebral structures, and multisystem trauma was associated with a statistically significant poorer prognosis. Additionally, in demographically similar groups of patients (age, sex, concomitant injury) preselected for intracranial pressures of less than 15 mmHg at the time of surgery, no significant difference in survival was appreciated in patients who underwent early (0 to 3 days), middle (4 to 7 days), or late (greater than 7 days) surgical repair. Early surgical repair of facial fractures in these circumstances does not appear to have a negative impact on recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical approaches to the eyelids and eyebrows have been refined by application of their anatomy and appreciation of their pathophysiology. Sexual variations in eyebrow appearance can be attributed in part to the eyebrow fat pad. In females, the eyebrow is generally arched and above the level of the supraorbital rim. The male eyebrow is flatter and at the level of the supraorbital rim. The eyebrow fat pad is more prominent in the male, producing a fuller appearance in the lateral brow area. Many women are concerned about the flatter, full lateral brow, which assumes a masculine quality. The authors describe a surgical technique that permits identification of the brow fat pad and then the ability to debulk the eyebrow (browplasty). In addition, the brow can be elevated by internal plication suture to physically elevate the eyebrow (browpexy). This procedure is designed to utilize an eyelid crease incision, and it reduces the indications for more involved procedures to eliminate brow ptosis, such as midforehead or coronal approaches.\r"

Through observation, we know that actinic radiation intensifies the apparent aging of skin. We have investigated the effects of aging and actinic radiation on the ability of fibroblasts to contract collagen-fibroblast lattices. Preauricular and postauricular skin samples were obtained from eight patients aged 49 to 74 undergoing rhytidectomy. The samples were kept separate, and the fibroblasts were grown in culture. Lattices constructed with preauricular fibroblasts consistently contracted more than lattices containing postauricular fibroblasts. The difference in amount of contraction in 7 days between sites was greatest for the younger patients and decreased linearly as donor age increased (r = -0.96). This difference may be due to preauricular fibroblasts losing their ability to contract a lattice as aging skin is exposed to more actinic radiation.\r"

However, in 8 of 146 individuals I have noted a problem with pain in the lateral aspect of the breast mound and the subscapular area, along with a depressed deformity superomedially and an unsightly bulge inferolaterally and/or laterally. Surgical exploration of the breast mound showed no abnormalities within the submuscular compartment. However, in all instances, the serratus anterior muscles were found to be detached from the ribcage all the way to the point beyond the posterior axillary line. While continuous pressure exerted on the serratus muscles by the implant appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this clinical entity, the onset of problems was usually delayed. Removal of the implants or repair of the cavity defects is necessary for patients who have developed this problem.\r"

A few cases of one-stage reconstruction of the upper abdomen also are reported. We attempted this procedure in six of seven patients who had large abdominal wall defects that reached the xiphoid process. In three patients, the intraabdominal parts of the procedures went well and the reconstructive goals were accomplished. In three other patients, prolonged and difficult intraabdominal operations resulted in considerable intestinal dilatation that compromised the reconstruction. We therefore recommend being prepared to abort a planned immediate abdominal wall reconstruction following a difficult intraabdominal operation. The abdomen should be temporarily closed with skin flaps, skin grafts, or absorbable mesh, and definitive reconstruction of the fascia should be done at a later operation.\r"

  ".W": "The radial forearm flap, although widely used, has been criticized for the poor quality of its donor site. To investigate the causes of morbidity, 100 radial artery free-flap donor sites have been reviewed. Sixty-seven patients required skin grafting (group 1), and the remaining 33 patients were closed directly (group 2). Seventeen patients in the series had compound osteocutaneous flaps (group 3). Wound healing proved to be a significant problem in groups 1 and 3, and fracture of the radius occurred in 4 of the 17 patients in group 3 and was the most significant cause of morbidity. The radial artery was reconstructed in 12 patients, but only 6 of the arteries (50 percent) were patent at the time of review. Subjective assessment on a scale of 0 to 10 demonstrated a relatively pain-free donor site with low pain scores (2.5 of 10). The cosmetic result was acceptable in men (1.5 of 10) but was less so in women (4 of 10). Angulated fracture of the radius produced an unacceptable cosmetic result (7 of 10). In light of this experience, we no longer reconstruct the radial artery as a matter of routine. The donor defect is closed directly wherever possible using an ulnar artery-based transposition flap when required. A \"boat shaped\" osteotomy is used in preference to right-angled bone cuts when harvesting a segment of radius to avoid the complications and sequelae of fracture. These changes in surgical technique have improved the acceptability and minimized the problems associated with this donor site.\r"

The size of the first flap was half the surface area of the entire forearm. Direct closure of the secondary defect was possible with a single scar and without functional deficit in both cases. The flaps were well-vascularized and consisted of the sensory distribution of one peripheral nerve division, which was anastomosed in the recipient site. This preparation proved to be finer and to have better contouring capacity and skin quality than existing alternatives. It is clear that hydraulic tissue expansion facilitates great additional use of the radial flap as well as a range of other modified free flaps when there is time available for the flap to be developed prior to transfer.\r"

The rediscovery of the \"random\" fasciocutaneous flap as a reliable single-stage option for proximal lower leg defects has been extended distally to allow an expedient alternative in lieu of these more complicated procedures. Over the past 7 years, 17 selected patients had closure of distal leg and ankle wounds with 19 local antegrade-oriented fasciocutaneous flaps. All eventually healed without serious sequelae, although 5 (26 percent) had minor complications, except for one case that could only be salvaged with a free-tissue transfer in order to prevent limb amputation. For small- or moderate-sized, uncontaminated injuries, this approach warrants consideration under appropriate circumstances as a simpler option that may permit satisfactory healing and avoids the known risks of microsurgical tissue transfers.\r"

Within each time period, rats received either saline or UK-38,485 at the primary ischemic episode and/or at the secondary ischemic episode. Flaps treated with UK-38,485 in relation to the period of secondary ischemia had a higher survival rate than control ischemic flaps (p less than 0.01). Those treated only at the end of the primary ischemic episode but prior to the secondary ischemic episode had improved survival rates, but these were not statistically significant. These effects may be explained by the lower thromboxane:prostacyclin ratios at the time of revascularization. The possible interrelationship of the prostanoids with free-radical mechanisms in the no-reflow phenomenon is also discussed.\r"

The course of the disease was complicated by local recurrence and formation of distant metastases to pleura and spine.

A surgical technique for the permanent repair of inverted nipples is described. The rationale for the surgical approach is that the major pathophysiologic basis for nipple inversion is shortened lactiferous ducts. Briefly outlined, under local anesthesia, the nipple is everted with a skin hook and held in gentle traction while a small incision is made on each side at the nipple-areola junction. Breast ducts are then divided by sharp dissection, and a drain is inserted through the tunnel under the nipple. The drain is removed in 7 to 10 days. The patient must be informed before the procedure that breast-feeding will not be possible afterward because breast ducts will be permanently divided. Advantages to the procedure are (1) no scars on the areola, (2) no stricture from sutures, (3) adequate blood and nerve supply to the nipple, and (4) decreased risk of hematoma.\r"

The dermacarrier, with the petroleum jelly, is laid onto the graft. The graft adheres to the dermacarrier because of the jelly. No further maneuver is necessary prior to meshing. With this technique it is impossible to apply the graft cut-side up on the recipient site.\r"

Issues relating to image perception and the impact on physicians' practice must be carefully considered. The spatial and contrast resolutions required vary according to imaging modality, type of procedure, and class of user. Rule-based software allows simple physician interaction and speeds image display. A consensus appears to be emerging concerning the requirements for the PACS workstation. Standards such as the American College of Radiology/National Electrical Manufacturers' Association Digital Imaging and Communication Standard are facilitating commercial applications. Yet much careful study is needed before PACS workstations will be fully integrated into radiology departments.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of nonacademic community hospitals was conducted to ascertain the degree of control radiologists have of 38 selected imaging or imaging-related interventional procedures. Responses from 187 hospitals showed that community hospital radiologists totally controlled or strongly dominated almost half of these procedures, including all computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging studies, bone radiography, breast needle localization, emergency department radiography, arthrography, obstetric ultrasound (US), renal and peripheral angioplasty, percutaneous abscess and biliary drainage, percutaneous nephrostomy, cerebral angiography, and interventional neuroangiography. Radiologists dominated in prostate and vascular US, myelography, urethrography, cardiac nuclear medicine, percutaneous lung biopsy, ureteral stent placement, and pulmonary angiography, but there was also significant participation in these studies by nonradiologists. Radiologists and nonradiologists had roughly equivalent roles in hysterosalpingography, peripheral atherectomy and laser angioplasty, and percutaneous inferior vena cava filter placement. Nonradiologists dominated in echocardiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, biliary and kidney stone lithotripsy, percutaneous gastrostomy, coronary angiography and angioplasty, and pediatric angiocardiography.\r"

One hundred thirty-one diagnostic radiology departments and 30 radiation therapy departments responded to the questionnaire. Despite the increasing number of women entering the field of radiology, many departments do not have formal policies. Of those that do, there was a wide range of responses regarding details of maternity leave and duties during pregnancy. The AAWR recommends that every department develop a written pregnancy and maternity leave policy, which should be available to all current and prospective employees.\r"

  ".U": "90311639\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the nature of radiologic research as practiced by both radiologists and nonradiologist physicians, original imaging-related reports published in the clinical literature during the first 6 months of 1989 were classified and compared. Most of the research by radiologist first authors involved technology development: invention (12%), standardization (35%), and description (32%). Original reports by nonradiologist-physician first authors involved description (28%), standardization (16%), validation (12%), assessment of other technologies (17%), and assessment of pathophysiology (19%). There were few patient outcome or cost-related articles in either category. The greatest difference between the categories was the larger number of reports by the nonradiologists that assessed pathophysiology by functional rather than morphologic criteria. The author concludes that the research performed by radiologists is primarily technology development, that assessment of pathophysiology with radiologic techniques is performed primarily by nonradiologists and is described more often in the nonradiology literature, and that academic radiology programs need to extend their research efforts to include evaluation of technology and functional assessment of disease process.\r"

Fifteen sequential images were obtained while the patients held their breath during a 2.5-3.5-minute interval during and immediately after the intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA); delayed images were also obtained for 15 minutes. Time-intensity curves showed that renal cortical enhancement reached maximal intensity 80 seconds after the injection of Gd-DTPA. Medullary enhancement reached maximal intensity at 120 seconds. None of the simple renal cysts showed enhancement; each cyst displayed a signal intensity less than that of the renal cortex on precontrast images. All renal cell carcinomas were isointense with the renal cortex and demonstrated variable enhancement. Three patterns of enhancement were observed: predominantly peripheral, heterogeneous, and homogeneous. Both the angiomyolipoma and the oncocytoma showed brisk, homogeneous enhancement. This MR imaging technique appears to be useful in the detection and characterization of simple renal cysts and solid neoplasms.\r"

Histologic examination showed that the lesions were lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (seven patients), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (13 patients), synchronous LCIS and invasive lobular carcinoma (one patient), and synchronous LCIS and DCIS (three patients). In all patients the mammographic manifestation was a mass 1.0 cm or greater in diameter; 14 masses were 1-2 cm in diameter, and the remainder were more than 2 cm in diameter. Features that were considered suspect included large size, indistinct margins, and clustered microcalcifications. In three patients, microcalcifications within the mass raised suspicion of malignancy. At histologic examination these microcalcifications were associated with the intraductal carcinoma harbored in the fibroadenoma in only one of these patients. Fibroadenomas that harbor carcinoma may be indistinguishable from common benign fibroadenomas, but their occurrence is rare. In this study, a single patient had invasive lobular carcinoma; all the other lesions were in situ lesions.\r"

Seventeen sequestrations were diagnosed at surgery, three at angiography, and four on the basis of radiographic or CT findings combined with appropriate history. Sixteen sequestrations were intralobar, and eight were extralobar; 21 were posterobasal. Seventeen occurred on the left side and seven on the right. Anomalous systemic arterial supply was demonstrated by CT in 16 sequestrations. In the others, a systemic artery was not shown, presumably because of unfavorable orientation or small size of the vessel. The lung abnormalities shown by CT were classified into three types: A = cysts containing air or fluid (n = 8), or soft-tissue masses (n = 2); B = emphysematous lung surrounding cysts, and/or soft-tissue nodules (n = 13); and C = lung hypervascularity (n = 2). In only three cases did the chest radiograph show the emphysematous lung tissue. Such emphysematous lung has rarely before been reported as a CT finding, and lung hypervascularity has not, to the authors' knowledge, been reported. The authors conclude that CT can be helpful in the diagnosis and evaluation of bronchopulmonary sequestration. Characteristic manifestations are (a) a complex lesion containing solid or fluid components combined with emphysematous lung or (b) any basal lesion supplied by a systemic artery.\r"

Chest radiographic assessment included the subjective determination of disease extent and measurements of lung length and the arc of the right hemidiaphragm. Disease extent on CT scans was scored as a percentage of lung that was abnormal on the basis of visual assessment of the degree of cystic replacement of the lung parenchyma. Significant correlations were observed between CT scores and percentages of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -.92, P less than .002) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (r = -.80, P less than .017). No significant correlations were observed between subjective chest radiographic scores and pulmonary function tests, although measurements of lung length and percentage of predicted total lung capacity were correlated (r = .76, P less than .045). CT was more accurate than chest radiography in defining the presence and extent of parenchymal cysts and provided for greater morphologic-physiologic correlation. CT, particularly high-resolution CT, may be useful in the diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of patients with this disease and may be more sensitive than pulmonary function tests in the early stages of lung damage.\r"

The thickened intralobular lines were shown histologically to be due to peribronchiolar fibrosis. Thickened interlobular lines were due mainly to interlobular fibrotic thickening in four lungs and edema in three. The peribronchiolar fibrosis was most severe in the subpleural lung regions, creating curvilinear line shadows and pleural-based areas of opacity. Some subpleural fibrosis extended proximally along the bronchovascular sheath to create bandlike lesions. Areas of ground-glass appearance on HRCT scans were shown to be the result of mild alveolar wall and interlobular septal thickening due to fibrosis or edema. Postmortem HRCT findings were similar to premortem HRCT findings and correlated well with the pathologic findings of asbestosis.\r"

The pneumothorax rate was 24% (11 of 46 patients) in group A and 30% (14 of 47 patients) in group B. The chest tube insertion rate was 2.2% (one patient) in group A and 2.1% (one patient) in group B.

Granulation tissue constantly appeared enhanced on studies done with gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), unlike cholesteatoma, cholesterol granuloma, or brain herniation into the middle ear cavities. Evaluation of extension and thickness of the inflammatory tissue with MR imaging was in accordance with surgical findings. In six cases, isolated granulation tissue misdiagnosed as either a cholesteatoma or herniated brain on CT scans was accurately evaluated on postcontrast MR images. When granulation tissue was associated with other soft-tissue masses, Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images allowed accurate definition of the site and the extension of each lesion. Furthermore, abnormal meningeal enhancement was precisely depicted by MR images in two cases.\r"

In patients, brain phosphocreatine (PCr) and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) concentrations in sections through the centrum semiovale that were seen with NMR spectroscopy were reduced significantly from normal values of 4.92 mmol/kg wet weight +/- .13 (standard error of the mean) and 2.79 mmol/kg +/- .11, respectively, to 3.33 mmol/kg +/- .26 and 1.99 mmol/kg +/- .13 (P less than .0001). The ratios of metabolites detectable with P-31 NMR spectroscopy did not differ significantly from those of control subjects. The magnitude of the PCr and NTP deficits in ADC was not explicable by focal abnormalities or cerebral atrophy quantified in images of the same regions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a generalized virus-associated toxic process affecting brain cell function in ADC. Noninvasive measurement of metabolite concentrations with NMR spectroscopy provides new functional information that may help quantify disease progression and response to therapy.\r"

This technique (EEG electrode projection) was used in 10 patients who subsequently underwent surgery for medically intractable frontal lobe epilepsy. In most cases of intractable epilepsy, successful surgery entails the resection of electrophysiologically abnormal cortical tissue rather than an identifiable mass lesion. EEG electrode projection is a unique and useful surgical tool because it provides images that spatially correlate the surface anatomy of the brain and the electrophysiologic abnormality recorded at the scalp. Excellent correlation was found between cortical topography delineated by the surface rendered images and cortical anatomy at surgery. Agreement between EEG electrode projection and electrocorticography as to the location of the electrophysiologic abnormality increases confidence that appropriate cortical areas have been identified for resection. The technique provides new and unique insight into important anatomic-electrophysiologic relationships and aids in formulation of surgical strategy.\r"

In seven examinations in seven patients, a ratio, or gradient, between the ACTH levels in the inferior petrosal sinuses existed in the samples obtained prior to CRH stimulation; however, poststimulation samples demonstrated reversal of the gradient, suggesting lateralization to the contralateral side of the pituitary gland. Data from surgical exploration of the pituitary gland were available for six of these patients, all of whom had adenomas. Prestimulation samples provided correct lateralization in three patients, and in two patients the poststimulation samples provided correct lateralization. One patient had a midline adenoma. When the results of pre- and poststimulation petrosal sinus sampling conflict, neither can be relied on uniformly to provide correct lateralization of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas.\r"

Frozen cadaveric motion segments of the lumbar spine (intervertebral disk and contiguous vertebrae) were imaged with computed tomography (CT). The segments were thawed and compressed in a hydrostatic press to simulate axial loading, and then the segments were frozen and imaged again. The motion segments were subsequently sectioned with a cryomicrotome, and the chronic degenerative changes present in the disks were classified. Pre- and post-compression CT images were compared, and anatomic relationships were studied. In 41 randomly selected segments (some with preexisting radial, transverse, and concentric annular tears), compression diminished the diameters and cross-sectional areas of the spinal canal and neural foramina. In no cases were nerve roots displaced, distorted, or compressed by axial loading. This study suggests that axial loading, such as that produced by ordinary weight bearing, does not critically compromise the neural foramina even in the presence of chronic degenerative disk changes.\r"

At very high diffusion-sensitizing gradient strengths, no clear evidence of anisotropic water diffusion was found in either cortical or subcortical (basal ganglia) gray matter. Signal intensities clearly dependent on orientation were observed in the cortical and deep white matter of the brain and in the white matter of the spinal cord. Greater signal attenuation (faster diffusion) was observed when the relative orientation of white matter tracts to the diffusion-sensitizing gradient was parallel as compared to that obtained with a perpendicular alignment. These effects were seen on both premortem and immediate postmortem images obtained in all axial, sagittal, and coronal views. Potential applications of this MR imaging technique included the stereospecific evaluation of white matter in the brain and spinal cord and in the characterization of demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases.\r"

Contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic studies available in 10 of these 18 cases did not depict this structure. Characteristic features of this MR finding were reviewed, and criteria were defined to distinguish this tail from other enhanced structures. To assess the differential diagnostic value of this finding, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced MR studies of a control group of other extraaxial lesions as well as superficial intraaxial tumors that abut the meninges were reviewed. These cases failed to show this MR feature. Pathologic correlation was available in three meningiomas with the finding of a tail, and these demonstrated meningothelial tumor nodules in the samples taken from areas corresponding to the enhanced regions on MR images. This is in agreement with other recent pathologic studies of the dura mater surrounding meningiomas. The authors believe that the linear enhanced structure described may represent tissue containing tumoral nodules. Awareness of this MR sign may be useful in distinguishing meningiomas from other lesions and in planning total resection of the infiltrated dura mater.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of the skin were acquired with a whole-body MR system at 1.5 T by adding a specific imaging module: A saddle-shaped surface gradient coil was connected in place of one of the gradient coils of the system, and a surface radio-frequency coil with a 1.5-cm radius was placed at the center of the gradient coil. The images, acquired in 3 minutes 25 seconds, represent a field of view of 18 x 50 mm2, which corresponds to a pixel size of 70 x 390 micro2; the section thickness was 1.2 mm. With this spatial resolution, the different layers of the skin are clearly delineated: Epidermis appears as a high-signal-intensity layer, while dermis appears hypointense due to its very short T2. Pilosebaceous units appear as inclusions of epidermis inside dermis. The high quality of the images obtained enables in vivo MR characterization of skin.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography with use of an oblique gradient-recalled echo sequence is discussed. The technique was developed for the efficient acquisition of angiographic data when the desired projection direction is already known. The raw data set is acquired directly at the projection angle; thus, a high-resolution projection is created, despite a decrease in the number of phase-encoding views acquired per axial image. Excessive reduction in the number of views acquired causes a loss of contrast in the projection images rather than a loss of resolution. High-resolution, high-contrast MR projection angiograms can be obtained in 2 1/2 minutes, with 50 3-mm sections and 48 phase encodings per section, a repetition time of 50 msec, an echo time of 15 msec, and a flip angle of 45 degrees. This represents one-fifth the time required for a conventional angiographic image. Venous blood is successfully saturated when the saturation band is placed at a fixed distance from the current imaging section. The method is demonstrated in the imaging of the carotid bifurcation in healthy volunteers and of a patient who had undergone carotid endarterectomy.\r"

In vitro experiments demonstrated a direct linear relationship between the concentration of particulate iron and phosphorus-31 chemical shift or line broadening. In vivo experiments indicated that an intravenous dose of 5-10 mg of iron per kilogram of body weight suppressed P-31 signal from normal liver in healthy rats. In rats with hepatic implants of mammary adenocarcinoma, superparamagnetic iron oxide particles suppressed detectable P-31 or hydrogen-1 signal arising from healthy liver tissue, but not that from tumor. Signal due to surface tissues, which affect surface-coil spectra, could be selectively suppressed with a film-based application of particles to the abdominal wall. Thus, P-31 spectra from simulated or actual lesions could be selectively detected after chemically suppressing signals from neighboring or surrounding tissue.\r"

In contrast to the spin-echo images obtained before injection of contrast material, it appears possible with this technique to distinguish joint effusion from hypervascular pannus formations and to grade the vascularity of proliferative synovitis. Flat pannus deposits on the articular surface and subchondral pannus masses were identified only by their marked enhancement of signal intensity after injection of contrast material. Dynamic MR imaging appears to yield decisive information for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Specimens were sectioned and examined grossly for cartilage changes such as softening, blistering, fibrillation, fissuring, and frank subchondral bone exposure. In a side-by-side comparison, all lesions classified grossly in the Shahriaree system as stage II or higher showed MR changes. Stage I changes could not be identified in disarticulated specimens. Stage III lesions showed cartilage irregularity (ulceration) or a loss of the normal, sharply defined margin between coapted cartilage, which represented \"crabmeat\" fibrillation. Stage IV lesions showed ulceration to bone, sometimes with subchondral bone changes. In this in vitro, preliminary study, MR imaging was found to be an accurate means for detecting and staging moderate and advanced patellar cartilage lesions.\r"

All patients satisfied accepted clinical orthopedic criteria for meniscal healing. MR examinations obtained 3-27 months after injury revealed persistent signal intensity (grade 3), unchanged from that seen on the preoperative study, in all 15 patients in whom both pre- and postoperative studies were obtained and in three of four menisci that were proved to be healed at second-look arthroscopy. It appears that grade 3 signal from both conservatively treated and repaired menisci may persist long after the tear has become asymptomatic and has presumably healed. The presence of such signal should not be interpreted as necessarily indicating meniscal retear in these patients. Persistent signal intensity at the site of previous injuries may account for some reported cases of disagreement between MR and arthroscopic findings.\r"

Among FLASH sequences, contrast between neoplasms and muscle was sufficient with a flip angle of 90 degrees following administration of Gd-DTPA but was 61% lower than that with the T2-weighted SE sequence. High contrast levels were obtained between tumors and bone marrow or fat in sclerotic, calcified, and fibrotic lesions with the use of a flip angle of 90 degrees and in lytic lesions with a flip angle of 10 degrees, reaching 66% of the contrast level obtained with the T1-weighted SE sequence. C/N between tumor and surrounding tissue was always significantly lower with FLASH sequences than with the ideal SE sequences usually used for tumor delineation. Thus, a replacement of the T2-weighted SE sequences by FLASH sequences cannot be recommended. A replacement of the T1-weighted SE sequences by FLASH sequences seems possible but does not significantly reduce examination time.\r"

Lunate dorsiflexion is a well-recognized sign of an intercarpal ligamentous injury pattern known as dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI). It is less well recognized that excessive dorsal tilting of the lunate (DISI configuration) can also be produced by displacement of a scaphoid waist fracture. Since the management and prognosis of displaced scaphoid fractures may be quite different from those for nondisplaced fractures, radiologists can make an important contribution by recognizing dorsal tilting of the lunate and appreciating that it may be an important, indirect sign of scaphoid fracture displacement, which may not be directly visualized with standard wrist radiography. In this setting, computed tomography or complex motion tomography may be helpful for further evaluation of the scaphoid fracture.\r"

No significant changes were observed in Pi/beta-ATP and pH. No changes occurred after the age of 3 years. Proton spectroscopy revealed an increase in the ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to choline (Ch) and NAA to creatine (Cr) and a decrease in Ch/Cr with increasing age.

There were five minor complications in four patients. None of the complications necessitated operative intervention or changed the clinical course of the patient. The external jugular vein is an excellent alternative route for caval filter placement. The external jugular vein approach does not necessitate surgical cutdown in the operating room for venous access, avoids deep vascular punctures in the neck and groin, and is safe in patients receiving systemic anticoagulation therapy.\r"

Eighteen of 20 episodes of endoprosthesis occlusion were successfully managed with normalization of biochemical parameters and alleviation of clinical manifestations. No therapy was attempted in two episodes of stent occlusion due to widespread metastatic disease. All 17 patients received intravenous fluid replacement and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. This was sufficient therapy to relieve symptoms in two cases of occlusion. Occluded stents were removed in the other 16 patients by means of radiologic (n = 10) or endoscopic (n = 6) methods. After the acute septic episode had subsided (2-5 days; mean, 3 days), new endoprostheses were percutaneously inserted in 10 cases of occlusion, long-term internal-external catheters were placed in five, and surgical bypass was performed in one. The authors conclude that endoprosthesis occlusion should not be considered a terminal event in patients with malignant biliary disease.\r"

No statistically significant differences in success rate based on lesion site, lesion length, degree of lesion calcification, or severity of peripheral vascular disease were found. Major complications were a laser perforation resulting in treatment failure in one case (3%) and a successfully treated distal embolus in another (3%). No reocclusions occurred in the immediate postoperative period.

In 14 subjects treated with CCK, there was no tracer activity in the bowel up to 2 hours in seven (50%) (P = .006). Eighty-three cholescintigrams obtained in patients with suspected acute cholecystitis were also retrospectively analyzed. In 53 of 83 patients in whom the gallbladder was visualized within 1 hour, significantly delayed BBTT was found in 14 of 29 (48%) who received CCK, compared with the BBTT in one of 24 patients (4%) who did not receive CCK (P less than .001). In the 30 patients in whom the gallbladder was never visualized (n = 28) or was visualized after 1 hour (n = 2), BBTT was less than 30 minutes, regardless of whether patients were treated with CCK.

All images were acquired between 1 and 24 hours after injection. Liver-lesion contrast ratios and contrast-to-noise ratios (C/Ns) were calculated. Results showed increased liver-lesion contrast and C/Ns with increased iron oxide concentration up to 10-20 mumol/kg at all four magnetic field strengths. At 0.15 T, iron oxide produced lower gains in tumor-liver contrast. At middle and high magnetic field strengths, liver-lesion contrast was similar for each level of iron oxide concentration, but C/Ns were markedly higher at 1.5 T than at middle field strength. Low levels of iron oxide contrast agent are effective at magnetic field strengths of 0.35 T and above, producing the greatest increase in C/N at middle field strengths.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with advanced untreated head and neck cancer, nine patients with recurrent cancer, and six patients with recurrent cancer who underwent surgery and had postoperative persistence of tumor were treated with three 2-week courses of irradiation (1,500 cGy in 10 fractions each) concurrently with cisplatin and a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil. A fourth 2-week course of irradiation (2,000 cGy in 10 fractions) brought the final tumor dose to 6,500 cGy. Twenty patients in the untreated group and three patients in the recurrent group (33%) had a complete response. There were 10 local recurrences in the untreated group (43%), seven in the recurrent group (78%), and three in the persistent group (50%). At 17 months after the start of treatment, the survival rate for the untreated patients was 51%, for the patients in the recurrent group it was 11%, and for the patients in the persistent group it was 20% (P = .03). Most patients experienced toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and mucositis. Clinical trials are necessary to determine whether simultaneous chemotherapy and radiation therapy is an improved method of treatment for advanced head and neck cancer.\r"

The contrast can be changed by variation of the time delay between the inversion pulse and the first excitation. This snapshot technique was introduced for very fast acquisition of images, but it also provides images with a strong contrast of gray to white matter and of brain tissue to cerebrospinal fluid. The authors designed a sequence that allows sufficient spatial resolution and good image quality. The measurement time is 1.2 seconds, and the in-plane resolution is 0.8 mm. A large variation in contrast with different inversion times was demonstrated on brain images of volunteers and patients.\r"

The passively deviated eye was covered and the other eye viewed the target. With a hand-pointing task, targets were systematically mislocalized in the direction of the deviated nonviewing eye. A 4- to 6-degree error resulted when the nonviewing eye was offset 30 degrees from straight ahead. When the eye was deviated, the perceived \"straight-ahead\" was also displaced, by a similar amount, in the same direction. Since the efferent motor commands to the displaced and to the nondisplaced eyes are presumably identical by the law of equal innervation, the mislocalization of visual objects must be attributed to the change in proprioceptive information issued from the nonviewing, deviated eye. Thus proprioception contributes to the localization of objects in space.\r"

Ischemic injury can be mimicked by TNF. When given before or immediately after ischemic injury, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) reduced the amount of superoxide anions in the coronary circulation, maintained endothelial-dependent coronary relaxation, and reduced injury mediated by exogenous TNF. Thus, TGF-beta prevented severe cardiac injury, perhaps by alleviating damage mediated by increases in circulating TNF.\r"

The stimulatory epitope overlaps with an epitope recognized by arthritogenic alpha beta T cell clones.

Carbon-13-labeled proflavine was used to show that the drug is stacked with the aromatic ring plane perpendicular to the fiber axis and that it is essentially immobile. Natural abundance carbon-13 NMR of the DNA itself shows that proflavine binding does not change the puckering of the deoxyribose ring. However, phosphorus-31 NMR spectra show profound changes in the orientation of the phosphodiester grouping on proflavine binding, with some of the phosphodiesters tilting almost parallel to the helix axis, and a second set almost perpendicular. The first group to the phosphodiesters probably spans the intercalation sites, whereas the tilting of the second set likely compensates for the unwinding of the DNA by the intercalator.\r"

This report emphasizes the importance of studying both the intracranial dural vessels as well as the supply to the cervical spine in searching for a spinal arteriovenous malformation. Subarachnoid hemorrhage with negative cerebral angiography requires spinal angiography if there are any signs or symptoms suggesting cord or nerve root dysfunction. Embolization by an endovascular approach resulted in an angiographic cure in two patients. A combination of embolization and surgery resulted in obliteration of the arteriovenous malformation in one patient. Embolization achieved a clinical cure in one patient, and clinical improvement in two patients.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging was superior to computed tomography scan for demonstrating blood in the ventricles or posterior fossa subarachnoid space, transependymal migration of the cerebrospinal fluid, and several kinds of iatrogenic intracranial pathologies in postoperative patients. Ischemic lesions, particularly fresh lesions caused by delayed cerebral vasospasm, were much better shown on magnetic resonance imaging than on computed tomography scan. Nonferromagnetic Sugita clips caused significant artifacts, but the area of artifacts was consistently smaller, and a reasonable evaluation of structures relatively closer to the clip was possible with magnetic resonance imaging rather than computed tomography scan.\r"

The data from groups of patients with and without newly formed or enlarged thrombi were compared. Intracardiac thrombi were detected in eight of the 30 patients (27%), four at admission and four after admission. Enlargement of the thrombus was observed in four, and systemic embolization recurred in three of the eight. Antithrombin III levels already were low at admission in patients who later developed thrombi or had enlarged thrombi on serial examinations. When the development or enlargement of an intracardiac thrombus was detected by echocardiography, the diameter of the inferior vena cava was found to be reduced. At the same time, a decrease in antithrombin III and an increase in hematocrit were demonstrated. Intracardiac thrombi are frequently detected by repeated echocardiographic examination in patients with cerebral embolism. Dehydration seems to accelerate thrombus formation that is reflected by a decrease in antithrombin III. A low antithrombin III level at admission and/or a decrease in antithrombin III after admission may indicate the possible recurrence of embolism.\r"

Therapies have been proposed as being effective because of early clinical improvement. The frequency and degree of spontaneous improvement in such patients, however, is unknown. We prospectively evaluated the course of 29 patients (19 men, 10 women) aged 33-82 years who were seen less than or equal to 12 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke. Seventeen patients were first evaluated less than or equal to 6 hours and the remaining patients at 6-12 hours after onset. All patients were examined using a modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at baseline, 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours. No specific treatment for acute ischemic stroke was given during this time. Improvement (defined as a decrease of greater than or equal to 2 points from baseline score) was noted at 1 hour in seven patients (24%). By 6 hours 15 patients (52%) had improved, 12 (41%) were unchanged, and two (7%) were worse. Our results suggest that spontaneous, often dramatic improvement occurs in patients with acute ischemic stroke and should be taken into consideration in the design of any trial of acute treatment.\r"

To evaluate cognitive function in patients with multiple cerebral infarcts, we administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery to 23 consecutive male patients with clinical and brain computed tomographic findings consistent with at least two separate areas of cerebral infarction. Based on brain computed tomographic findings, patients were classified as having either mixed (n = 12) or lacunar (n = 11) infarcts. Results of these two groups were compared with those of 11 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls with no clinical or brain computed tomographic evidence of cerebrovascular disease. The mixed group had significantly lower mean scores than the controls for every cognitive domain tested. The lacune group showed cognitive impairment on most neuropsychological measures but did not differ from the controls in the attention domain. Although some degree of cognitive impairment was detected by the neuropsychological test battery in virtually every patient, only seven of 23 (30%) had Mini-Mental State Examination scores indicating dementia (less than 24). We conclude that virtually every patient with multiple cerebral infarcts has some degree of cognitive impairment but that only a minority can be classified as demented if the Mini-Mental State Examination is used as the primary defining examination.\r"

The patients had neither clinical nor cerebral computed tomographic evidence of infarction. Baseline regional cerebral blood flow was symmetrical before and unchanged after endarterectomy. Before endarterectomy, vasoreactivity in the middle and anterior cerebral artery territories of the symptomatic side was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05); however, vasoreactivity was normalized 3 months after surgery. Our findings strongly suggest that the stenoses caused a reduction in perfusion reserve that was improved by carotid endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional echocardiography has a high specificity for the detection of intracardiac thrombi, but technically difficult studies are often encountered. Ultrafast cardiac computed tomography may be useful in such cases. Using transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and ultrafast cardiac computed tomography, we studied 36 patients with cerebral ischemia; one patient had the studies performed on two occasions, making a total of 37 sets of studies. Technical difficulties occurred in 12 echocardiographic (32%) and two ultrafast cardiac computed tomographic (5%) studies. The two techniques agreed in 29 sets of studies (78%). Among the eight discrepant sets of studies, two-dimensional echocardiography was positive for a left ventricular thrombus while ultrafast cardiac computed tomography was negative in three and equivocal in one and echocardiography was equivocal while ultrafast cardiac computed tomography was negative in two and positive in one. In the latter case, a left ventricular thrombus was confirmed at autopsy. In the other discrepant set of studies echocardiography was negative while ultrafast cardiac computed tomography revealed a left atrial and appendage thrombus. Because of its ease of performance and safety, two-dimensional echocardiography is the appropriate initial screening test for left ventricular thrombus. Ultrafast cardiac computed tomography can provide additional information in patients with technically difficult or equivocal two-dimensional echocardiographic studies or patients with cardiac disorders predisposing to atrial thrombi formation.\r"

Sites examined in the brain (the frontal pole, frontoparietal convexity, and lateral occipital region) were selected by the presence of angiographic abnormalities on the convexity of the hemisphere. At all examined sites, neither the vascular density (number of blood vessels per unit length of underlying cortical surface) nor the arterial/venous ratio differed significantly between the patients and 14 controls. All patients showed dilatative changes of both arteries and veins; however, attenuation or disruption of the internal elastic lamina and fibrous intimal thickening were more prominent in those patients who had had moyamoya disease longer. Our results indicate that the leptomeningeal vessels of moyamoya disease are not newly formed but are merely dilated preexisting vessels and that the structural alteration of the vascular walls suggests their adaptability for participation in the collateral circulation at the cerebral surface.\r"

The animals were killed at 40 minutes, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, or 6 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We assessed the integrity of the barrier function of intraparenchymal vessels in the ventral brain stem and cerebral hemispheres morphologically with transmission electron microscopy, using horseradish peroxidase as a tracer. In the ventral brain stem, which was in direct contact with the cisternal clots, markedly increased peroxidase staining toward the core of the brain stem was observed on the first day after subarachnoid hemorrhage. In an area of the cerebral hemispheres distant from the clots, barrier disturbance was prominent in the 6-hour specimens, and permeation of the tracer was spotty. From the distribution and morphological findings of these lesions, permeability changes in the ventral brain stem may have been caused by a direct effect of the cisternal clots; in the cerebral hemispheres, hemodynamic factors and changes in intracranial pressure associated with the elderly stages of subarachnoid hemorrhage seemed to be responsible. These results suggest that barrier disturbance associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage may be multifactorial in time course and location.\r"

The usefulness of technetium-99m-labeled cysteinate dimer as a marker in the measurement of regional cerebral blood flow was tested in five cynomolgus monkeys. To expand the range of blood flow to beyond the normal limits, 40 mg/kg i.v. of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide was administered. Regional cerebral blood flow in all five monkeys was measured using radiolabeled microspheres (before and after acetazolamide) and the marker (after acetazolamide) in 60-70 samples from 12 brain regions. Acetazolamide significantly increased the mean +/- SEM regional cerebral blood flow measured using microspheres from 0.56 +/- 0.21 to 1.71 +/- 0.9 ml/min/g (p less than 0.01 for each region). A significant positive correlation was found between regional cerebral blood flow values calculated using microspheres and the marker after normalizing the values to those in the cerebellum (r = 0.773, p less than 0.0001). The mean +/- SEM regional cerebral blood flow determined using the marker in a single monkey (1.21 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g) did not differ significantly from that determined in the same monkey using microspheres (1.13 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g). These data support the potential use of this new brain perfusion imaging agent to assess regional cerebral blood flow over a clinically relevant range of blood flows.\r"

Another 30 stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were killed soon after they showed symptoms of stroke. We found two kinds of pericytes around the capillaries: granular pericytes and filamentous pericytes. Granular pericytes possibly serve as scavenger cells in the central nervous system and became active and grew in size with time. In contrast, filamentous pericytes degenerated during the development of hypertension. Degeneration of the filamentous pericytes was involved in an increase of endothelial permeability. Increased permeability caused focal and then circumferential swelling of the astrocytes around the capillaries. Swelling of the astrocytes seemed to accelerate the production of attachment plaques. Following this increase in the number of attachment plaques, numerous astrocytic filaments were produced within the cytoplasm. As a result, fibrous astrocytes were fully developed. Adjacent to the fibrous astrocytes we detected opening of the interendothelial junctions as well as dead neurons. From these observations we propose that astrocytes perform the main function in trophic interactions among cerebral endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons and that dysfunction of astrocytes disturbs the neural environment, resulting in neuronal death.\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in 28 awake, restrained rats (14 normoglycemic and 14 hyperglycemic) using [14C]iodoantipyrine and dissection of 17 brain regions. Hemodilution lowered the hematocrit by 6 units (13%) and increased the average cerebral blood flow by 14%. Chronic hyperglycemia did not elevate the hematocrit, but it decreased the average cerebral blood flow by 12% and that in nine nontelencephalic brain regions by 17%. This effect was independent of changes in hematocrit caused by hemodilution. The reduced regional cerebral blood flow during chronic hyperglycemia is not caused by elevated hematocrit.\r"

The annual stroke rate given survival for the 428 patients in the population-based cohort was 0.5%/yr or 2.4% at 5 years. Patients with localized carotid bruit were not significantly different from those with diffuse carotid bruits in regard to subsequent cerebral ischemic events (p = 0.11).

Eleven patients (18%) suffered an embolic stroke, most less than or equal to 3 days after diagnosis and before the initiation of antimicrobial therapy; the rate of embolic stroke recurrence was low (9%). The risk of embolic stroke was lower with bioprosthetic than with mechanical valves. No protective effect of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin was observed. Six patients (8%) suffered brain hemorrhage due to septic arteritis, brain infarction, or undetermined causes; no specific risk of hemorrhagic stroke was evident with anticoagulation therapy. Antibiotic treatment appears to be more important than anticoagulation to prevent neurologic complications in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two cases of stenosis of the ureteropelvic junction were treated by endourologic procedures; 13 were associated with renal stones. Three techniques were used, depending on the type and degree of obstruction: (1) anterograde or retrograde dilation with a double-lumen balloon dilator catheter; (2) incision of the stricture with a cold knife after a percutaneous approach to the kidney; and (3) incision of the stenosis with a new flexible knife through a nephrostomy tract. Balloon dilation was always performed after the incision. No immediate complications were observed following the procedure. The average follow-up was eight months. A routine excretory urogram was done three months after treatment. There were four reobstructions, and in 1 patient the ureteropelvic junction could not be identified. Success rate was 77.3 percent.\r"

Currently, this is accomplished by using inferior venacavography. The limitations of this imaging technique include difficulty in defining the superior extent of the thrombus and determining the presence of hepatic vein involvement. We report our experience using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 9 patients to stage the thrombus and to determine the operative approach. We believe that MRI supplants other imaging techniques for staging tumor thrombi in renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Elongation of tunica albuginea was measured at the crural and mid portions of the penis. At rigidity there was complete blockage of the venous return through the emissary veins. The venous outflow through the cavernous veins was reduced but still persisted. The distention of the tunica albuginea was less important at the crural portion than at the distal portion and could explain why the cavernous veins were not blocked completely.\r"

Two concentric needle electrodes were introduced: one in the levator ani muscle (stimulating electrode) and the other in the external urethral sphincter (recording electrode). Levator stimulation evoked external sphincter contraction in all the subjects. The anesthetized sphincter did not respond while the saline-infiltrated one responded. The mean latency of the reflex was 168 ms. The levator-urethral reflex regulates the relation between micturition and continence. Reflex external urethral sphincter contraction keeps micturition under control despite the involuntary opening of the vesical neck as a result of levator contraction. Measurement of the latency of the reflex could be an objective and accurate means of investigating micturition disorders.\r"

  ".W": "To assess frequency and outcome of emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for failed coronary angioplasty in patients with prior CABG, 2,136 elective angioplasty procedures in prior CABG patients were reviewed over a 10-year period. Emergency surgical revascularization was required in 19 patients (0.9%) with prior CABG, compared with 130 of 6,974 patients (1.9%) without prior CABG (p = 0.001). The interval from the most recent CABG to the failed coronary angioplasty was 6.8 years (range 1 to 16). Referral for emergency CABG was made on the basis of an acute closure not responding to repeat dilatation in 12 native coronary arteries and in 7 saphenous vein grafts. Severe hemodynamic instability after acute closure required the placement of an intraaortic balloon pump in 3 patients, including 2 who required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A total of 34 saphenous vein grafts and 1 internal mammary artery graft were placed emergently. Three patients with high-risk features (3 prior CABG operations in 1 patient, single remaining vessel to heart in 2 patients) could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. The remaining 16 patients were discharged after a mean hospital stay of 16 days. Four patients developed new Q waves after CABG. At follow-up (mean 52 months, range 3 to 99), 1 patient died late from an acute myocardial infarction. The 15 survivors had no or mild angina and were free of further CABG. Thus, emergency CABG after failed angioplasty in patients with prior CABG is required infrequently. In patients without extreme high-risk features, emergency repeat CABG can be accomplished with good hospital and long-term results.\r"

Volume infusion increased cardiac output only slightly (11%, p less than 0.001), despite a dramatic increase in ventricular filling pressures. Dobutamine (4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) markedly increased cardiac output (24%, p less than 0.001) with a decrease in ventricular filling pressures. In the 5 patients with TR, dobutamine only modestly increased cardiac output (9 vs 26%, p less than 0.001), while stroke index and LV end-diastolic dimensions decreased in comparison (-5 vs 33% and -6 vs 9%, respectively, p less than 0.001). In the absence of TR (n = 15), there was no significant difference in response to volume expansion between patients with normal (n = 7) and depressed LV ejection fraction (n = 8). In contrast, dobutamine, in patients with depressed LV function, induced a greater increase in cardiac output (38 vs 17%, p less than 0.01) and RV ejection fraction (36 vs 12%, p less than 0.05). All patients with RV infarction-induced low cardiac output responded only modestly to volume loading. Dobutamine is particularly efficacious in patients without TR who have depressed LV function by improving RV function and, consequently, LV preload. In the 5 patients with TR, increasing RV contractility failed to improve the forward stroke volume by increasing the regurgitant fraction.\r"

In 27 (87%) of the 31 patients, radionuclide evidence of ischemia recovered more quickly than the electrocardiogram. Only 15 of the 31 patients had exercise-induced radionuclide abnormalities after exercise. Compared with the 16 patients without such findings of ischemia after exercise, these 15 patients had a worse wall motion score at peak exercise (5.3 vs 3.9; p less than 0.01) and a smaller increase in systolic blood pressure with exercise (p less than 0.05) and after exercise (p less than 0.01). Radionuclide angiographic evidence of ischemia recovers more quickly after exercise than ST-segment depression. When there is radionuclide evidence of ischemia after exercise, it is associated with more severe ischemia during exercise.\r"

There was a correlation (positive) of changes in flow with changes in coronary lumen diameter (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01) with ST-segment response to exercise (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) and with (inverse) norepinephrine plasma concentration (r = -0.70, p less than 0.01); no correlation was found between ST-segment response and changes in arterial lumen diameter. In a few cases, nifedipine did not improve or even worsened the response to exercise; coronary flow was unchanged or decreased and norepinephrine plasma levels were modestly or greatly increased, respectively. After 4 weeks of treatment with nifedipine (10 to 20 mg 4 times daily), the effort ST-segment shift was further decreased to 4.4 +/- 3.5 mm (p less than 0.03) despite a slightly increased double product. Plasma norepinephrine values, as compared to those after acute nifedipine, were decreased by 40% in patients with further improvement and were unchanged in patients whose exercise performance did not vary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive recording of ventricular late potentials and intraoperative endocardial mapping at 36 sites were performed in 24 patients with left ventricular aneurysm and drug-resistant sustained ventricular tachycardia due to coronary artery disease. Their mean age was 55 +/- 8 years. Mean ejection fraction was 28 +/- 12%. For detection of late potentials on the signal-averaged QRS complex, 3 different algorithms were used. Late potentials were found in 54, 67 and 67% of the patients, respectively. In patients with a late potential on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG), delayed local activation (greater than 40 ms beyond the QRS complex on the intraoperative surface ECG) was recorded at 5.5, 5.5 and 5.6 endocardial sites. In patients without a late potential, this type of delayed local activation was detected at 2.4, 1.1 and 0.9 of 36 endocardial sites, respectively (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01; p less than 0.002). The mean delay of local endocardial activity was 38, 35 and 37 ms in patients with a late potential on the body surface recording versus 20, 19 and 11 ms, respectively, in patients without a late potential (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.05; p less than 0.002). There was no correlation between the duration or amplitude of the late potential, if present, and the number of endocardial sites exhibiting delayed activity (r = -0.23, r = -0.05, r = 0.21; correlation not significant for each) or the mean duration of the endocardial delayed activity (r = -0.25, r = -0.14, r = -0.07; correlation not significant for each). These results indicate that the presence of late potentials on the signal-averaged surface ECG is related to the mean duration of endocardial late activity as well as to the number of endocardial sites exhibiting a given degree of delayed activation. Thus, it is dependent on the mass of slowly activated tissue. However, a direct conclusion from the duration or the amplitude of a late potential to the amount of delayed activation or the extent of endocardial time delay does not seem possible.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nitroprusside on pressure wave transmission from ascending aorta to radial artery was studied in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Nitroprusside resulted in a beneficial increase in cardiac index, reduction of pulmonary wedge pressure and reductions of aortic and radial arterial mean pressures. In 6 patients with an identifiable late systolic peak of aortic pressure (group I), nitroprusside reduced aortic systolic pressure more than radial systolic pressure, resulting in an increase in the difference between aortic and radial systolic arterial pressure (group I control 13 +/- 4, nitroprusside 20 +/- 6 mm Hg; p less than 0.025). Yet in 4 patients in whom no aortic late systolic pressure wave was apparent (group II), nitroprusside did not alter the difference between aortic and radial systolic pressures. Radial arterial pressure is often used to estimate the effect of nitroprusside on the arterial pressure load on the left ventricle. These results indicate that a reduction of radial systolic pressure induced by nitroprusside may underestimate the true reduction of aortic systolic pressure and thus the effect of the vasodilator on the arterial load on the left ventricle. The enhanced difference between aortic and radial arterial systolic pressures appears to be the consequence of nitroprusside on arterial pressure reflections.\r"

The mean aortic valve area increased from 0.5 to 0.8 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Using echocardiography, meridional end-systolic wall stress decreased from 81 to 63 x 10(3) dynes/cm2 (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.48 to 0.54 (p less than 0.01), end-diastolic volume decreased from 161 to 143 ml (p less than 0.001) and end-diastolic pressure decreased from 18 to 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular stroke work (the area of the pressure-volume loop) also decreased from 17.5 to 14.7 x 10(6) ergs (p less than 0.001). The loop shifted to the left and downward. At the 6-month study, the mean and peak aortic valve gradient increased from 36 to 56 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and 38 to 61 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive detection and semiquantitative assessment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were performed using first-pass radionuclide angiography (RNA), by sampling a region of interest over the right atrium for any tracer entering the right atrium during right ventricular systole. The relative amount of tracer entering the right atrium was quantitated and the results were compared with semiquantitative Doppler echocardiographic grading of TR severity. Using the right ventricular time-activity curve to define end-diastolic and end-systolic frames, the right atrial counts for the 2 or 3 cardiac cycles after the peak right ventricular counts were summed. The right atrial \"injection fraction\" was calculated using the following formula: [(end-systolic counts - end-diastolic counts)/(end-diastolic counts)] X 100%. The right atrial injection fraction was examined in 51 patients who had good quality RNA and Doppler studies. Of 27 patients with no evidence of TR by Doppler, 26 had a negative right atrial injection fraction. All 24 patients with a positive Doppler for TR had a positive right atrial injection fraction. Comparison of right atrial injection fraction grade ranges with semiquantitative grades of TR severity on Doppler revealed identical grades in 21 of the 24, with a single grade difference in the remaining 3 patients. Thus, right atrial time-activity curve quantitation during routine first-pass RNA allows detection and grading of the severity of TR, with results very similar to pulsed Doppler echocardiography. This simple procedure is easily appended to the evaluation of ventricular performance with first-pass RNA.\r"

  ".W": "From 1946 to March 1989, 92 patients (33 women and 59 men) were seen with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and audible aortic regurgitation (AR). The VSD was subcristal in 62 patients, subpulmonary in 21 and unknown in the remaining 9. The median age of onset of AR was 5.3 years. The risk of developing AR was 2.5 times greater in those with a subpulmonary VSD. The aortic valve was tricuspid in 90% and bicuspid in 10%. Prolapse was seen in 90% of those with subcristal VSD and in all with subpulmonary VSD. Pulmonary stenosis was seen in 46% of the patients with gradients ranging from 10 to 55 mm Hg. The incidence of infective endocarditis was 15 episodes/1,000 patient years. Among 20 patients followed medically, for 297 patient years, 1 died (1959) and most have been stable, including 2 followed for greater than 30 years. In the 72 patients operated on, there were 15 perioperative and 5 late deaths. Operations consisted of VSD closure alone in 7, VSD closure and valvuloplasty in 50 and VSD closure and aortic valve replacement in the other 15. Valvuloplasty was more effective in those operated on under age 10 compared to those older than 15 years (46 vs 14%). The durability of the valvuloplasty was 76% at 12 years and 51% at 18 years.\r"

Seventy-nine patients underwent treadmill exercise tests, and ventricular premature complexes were induced in 17 (22%). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring in 92 patients demonstrated significant ventricular arrhythmias (greater than or equal to grade 2 of the Lown classification) in 41 (45%). The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias correlated with length of follow-up and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. No correlation was found with age at surgery, postoperative right ventricular systolic pressure and importance of conduction defects on electrocardiogram.

The patient population had a large prevalence of severe or unstable cardiac disease (56% had New York Heart Association class III, IV or V, 12.6% had left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 mm Hg and 34% had 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease). The overall minor adverse reaction rate was 14.2%. Major adverse reactions (requiring treatment) occurred in 61 (1.3%) of procedures. All adverse reactions were managed successfully and there were no deaths. Adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with higher New York Heart Association classes and with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The adverse reaction rate was not increased in patients with more extensive coronary artery disease, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or reduced cardiac index. The overall adverse reaction rate was probably influenced by physician behavior. Smaller volumes of contrast agent were administered to patients with more severe cardiac disease. Six percent of procedures were abbreviated either because of an adverse reaction or of concern that a reaction might occur if the procedure were continued. As a result, the diagnostic data obtained were judged to be inadequate in 0.8% of procedures. These data demonstrate that appropriate operator caution within the highly monitored environment of the cardiac catheterization laboratory allows cardiac angiography to be performed safely with conventional ionic contrast agents in most patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study investigated the effect of in-patient cardiac rehabilitation on self-efficacy scores for 3 categories of activities: routine physical activities, daily living tasks and levels of concentration and ability to cope. On discharge from the intensive or coronary care unit, patients without contraindications to early ambulation were randomized to either a ward ambulation program (n = 26) or a dedicated exercise center program (n = 25) with all patients receiving the same standardized education/counseling. There were no differences between the groups in self-efficacy at baseline, at hospital discharge or 7 days later. Significant improvements in self-efficacy scores were observed by day 28 in both groups for routine physical activities and daily living tasks with no change in self-efficacy scores for concentration or ability to cope. At that time the exercise center patients had higher self-efficacy scores for walking time (p = 0.041) and overall exertion (p = 0.024) than the ward ambulation patients. For the majority of the self-efficacy variables considered, both in-patient exercise rehabilitation programs were equally effective in improving self-efficacy scores for physical activities and daily living tasks over the first 28 days after return to home. The lower cost associated with ward ambulation programs suggests that they are more cost-effective than developing a program in a dedicated in-patient exercise center.\r"

The relative risk for blacks increases progressively with age, reaching a maximum of 6.9 in persons over the age of 65. The incidence of ESRD due to diabetes is higher in the population with type I diabetes (492 per 100,000) than in the population with type II diabetes (71 per 100,000). Blacks have a higher incidence of ESRD in both type I diabetes (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 4.9) and type II diabetes (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.5).

We examined the relationship between blood levels and BP, the effect of calcium supplementation on blood lead, and whether the reported antihypertensive effect of calcium supplementation was related to any observed change in blood lead. BP was measured on four occasions, 1 week apart in 251 subjects. During this period, blood lead and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EPP) levels were measured, as well as markers of calcium metabolism. In an intervention period, 142 patients were assigned to receive 1 g of calcium per day as calcium carbonate for 12 weeks; at the end of this period, blood lead and EPP were remeasured. In males, blood lead levels were significantly, directly related to BP; a 0.48 mumol/dL (10 micrograms/dL) increase in blood lead concentration was associated with a 5 mm Hg increase in systolic pressure. There was no relationship of blood lead levels to BP in females. EPP was unrelated to BP. Similarly, there was no relationship of blood lead levels to markers of calcium metabolism. With calcium supplementation, blood lead and EPP levels did not change significantly. We conclude that it is unlikely that modification of lead status explains any effects of calcium supplementation on BP.\r"

Thirty-nine patients (12%) tested positive for HIV antibody (HIV+) with both the ELISA and Western blot, 24 (62%) of whom were known intravenous drug abusers (IVDA). Of the remaining non-IVDA patients, unanticipated HIV+ results were found in 10 (25%). Thirty-four (87%) of the 39 HIV+ patients were asymptomatic at the start of the study, while two had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and three others, AIDS-related complex (ARC). Four patients subsequently developed AIDS 20 +/- 4.9 weeks (range, 12 to 32) after testing, three of whom initially had ARC. One patient developed ARC 7 months after testing. Sixteen HIV+ patients died, including five of the six with AIDS, one with ARC, and two others from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The eight other deaths were from causes unrelated to HIV disease and occurred 12 +/- 2.3 months (range, 1 to 24) after testing. Two HIV+ patients were lost to follow-up.

  ".W": "The nutritional status of 35 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was assessed by the traditional methods of dietary history and anthropometric measurements, and was compared with simultaneous measurements of dietary protein intake (DPI) calculated from urea generation rate and total-body nitrogen (TBN) assessment by prompt neutron activation analysis (PNAA). DPI as determined by dietary recall was significantly higher than calculated DPI (1.04 +/- 0.42 v 0.84 +/- 0.28 g/kg/d; P less than 0.001). Anthropometric measurements did not differ significantly from the predicted normal values for sex, height, and age. However, PNAA measurements of TBN demonstrated significant nitrogen depletion, being 88.2% of normal for males (P less than 0.001) and 87.5% of normal for females (P less than 0.002); TBN correlated significantly with DPI calculated from urea generation rate (P less than 0.05). Assessment of these 35 patients 17.5 +/- 4.4 months later, demonstrated that patients who died or suffered serious morbidity requiring transfer from CAPD (n = 10) had significantly lower TBN than those who remained on CAPD or underwent successful renal transplantation (n = 25): 80.0% v 93.2% of normal (P less than 0.01). No difference in anthropometric measurements was observed between the two groups of patients. Eleven patients on maintenance home or satellite hemodialysis underwent identical dietary, anthropometric, and TBN assessments and results were similar to those obtained in the CAPD population, although no correlation with calculated DPI and TBN was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined this theory in 116 CAPD patients over a 2-year period. In CAPD patients who switched to the Y-set (n = 22), the catheter infection rate decreased from one per 13 patient-months to one per 26 patient-months (P = 0.05), whereas the catheter infection rate in matched controls (n = 22) remained unchanged. Patients who began CAPD using the Y-set (n = 36) had catheter infection rates of one per 14 patient-months versus one per 8 patient-months in matched controls (n = 36, P = 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of catheter infections in both groups of patients. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa replaced Staphylococcus epidermidis as the second most common cause of catheter infections in the patients using the Y-set. The number of catheters that had to be removed due to catheter infections, mainly those due to S aureus or P aeruginosa, was the same in the Y-set and control groups. We conclude that the Y-set system is associated with reduced numbers of catheter infections, but that catheter loss from catheter infections remains a serious problem.\r"

We report the unique association of acute and very severe isotonic hyponatremia with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure in the post-TURP setting. The mechanism for rhabdomyolysis is postulated to be an impairment of normal maintenance of cellular integrity by virtue of the acuteness and severity of hyponatremia, in the absence of a disturbance of tonicity. Survival after hyponatremia of this severity has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Programmed stimulation, left ventricular ejection fraction, and signal-averaged electrocardiography were performed in patients with organic heart disease and spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) to determine the role of these techniques in risk stratification and management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 90 patients: 63 had coronary artery disease and 27 had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Radionuclide ventriculography, signal-averaged electrocardiography, and programmed electrical stimulation were performed in all patients within 48 hours of index ambulatory electrocardiography. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (59%) had an ejection fraction less than 40%. Programmed stimulation induced sustained monomorphic VT in 22 patients (24%), ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 10 patients (11%), and no sustained VT/VF in 58 patients (64%). The signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) showed late potentials in 23 patients (26%). Sustained monomorphic VT could be induced in 65% of patients with late potentials and in 10% of those without late potentials. There was no case of inducible sustained monomorphic VT in 33 patients with no late potentials and an ejection fraction of 40% or greater. All patients with induced sustained monomorphic VT received antiarrhythmic therapy guided by the results of programmed stimulation. All 58 patients with no induced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and eight patients with induced VF were discharged without receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. During a follow-up of 30 +/- 10 months, the three-year sudden death rate was 19% in patients with induced sustained VT, 0% in those with induced VF, and 9% in those with no induced sustained VT/VF. The three-year sudden death rate was the same (7%) in patients with no induced sustained VT/VF, both in those with an ejection fraction of 40% or greater or less than 40%. On the other hand, the three-year total cardiac mortality was significantly higher (27%) in those patients with ejection fractions less than 40% compared to those with ejection fractions of 40% or greater (7%). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the signal-averaged ECG, ejection fraction, and programmed stimulation could be used for the risk stratification and management of patients with organic heart disease and nonsustained VT as follows: (1) Patients with no late potentials and with an ejection fraction of 40% or greater do not require invasive evaluation or antiarrhythmic therapy, since the incidences of induced VT and sudden death are very low. (2) Patients with late potentials as well as patients without late potentials but with an ejection fraction of less than 40% may be advised to undergo electrophysiologic evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We studied the efficacy of simvastatin, an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of cholesterol, in this disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients participated in an open-label study. After a three-week placebo period, they were treated with increasing doses (10 mg twice a day, 20 mg twice a day, and 40 mg twice a day) of simvastatin in six-week periods. RESULTS: With the 80-mg dose, the mean serum cholesterol level decreased from 12.30 +/- 4.96 to 5.29 +/- 1.24 mmol/L (mean reduction, 54%) and the mean serum triglyceride level decreased from 8.77 +/- 7.16 to 3.61 +/- 1.33 mmol/L (-48%); this was due to a decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipids. There was a decrease in the ratio of VLDL cholesterol to serum triglycerides and in the apolipoproteins B and E, suggesting a reduction in the amount of circulating atherogenic remnant particles. Except for a slight increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels in three patients, no side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: These data show that levels of serum lipids can be effectively reduced by simvastatin in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients who have atherosclerosis elsewhere but lack the usual clinical clues to suggest renal artery stenosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The arteriograms and charts of 395 consecutive patients were prospectively reviewed by a member of the Vascular Medicine Department and a member of the Radiology Department. These patients underwent arteriography as part of the routine evaluation for abdominal aortic aneurysm (109 patients), aorto-occlusive disease (21 patients), lower-extremity occlusive disease (189 patients), and suspected renal artery stenosis (76 patients). Patients in the first three groups did not have the usual clues that suggest renal artery stenosis. RESULTS: There was greater than 50% renal artery stenosis in 41 patients (38%) with abdominal aortic aneurysm, seven patients (33%) with aorto-occlusive disease, 74 patients (39%) with lower-extremity occlusive disease, and 53 patients (70%) with suspected renal artery stenosis. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis was similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, aorto-occlusive disease, or suspected renal artery stenosis, but higher in diabetics with lower-extremity occlusive disease (50%) compared to nondiabetics with lower-extremity occlusive disease (33%) (p = 0.022). High-grade bilateral disease was present in approximately 13% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm or lower-extremity occlusive disease, and totally occluded renal arteries occurred in 5% of the patients in these groups. There was an association between increasing degree of renal artery stenosis and the presence of hypertension and worsening of renal function. CONCLUSION: Patients with atherosclerosis elsewhere, especially abdominal aortic aneurysm, aorto-occlusive disease, or lower-extremity occlusive disease, have a high prevalence of significant renal artery stenosis even in the absence of the usual clues to suspect renal artery stenosis. Diabetic patients have a similar prevalence as nondiabetic patients. This information may have important therapeutic implications in patients being considered for vascular surgery.\r"

Clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, results of therapy, and hypotheses on pathophysiology are discussed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 13 HIV-infected patients who had developed T. gondii pneumonia. Eight had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prior to T. gondii pneumonia and three of them had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mean CD4 cell count was 32 x 10(6)/L. Serum anti-toxoplasma antibody titers were measured by an indirect hemagglutination assay and/or by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: All patients had fever and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates; two of them presented with septic shock. Mean arterial oxygen tension was 47 +/- 12 mm Hg. The diagnosis was established by bronchoalveolar lavage in 10 of 11 cases, open lung biopsy in one case, and postmortem biopsy in two cases. Serologic evidence of past infection was observed in 11 of 12 cases, while one patient presented with acute disseminated disease and absence of serum anti-toxoplasma antibody response. Extrapulmonary involvement was present in seven patients: liver (four), brain (three), bone marrow (two), heart (two), stomach (one). Ten patients recovered from T. gondii pneumonia. CONCLUSION: T. gondii pneumonia must be considered in AIDS patients with severe diffuse bilateral pneumonia, especially when associated with a very low CD4 cell count or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In most of these cases, disseminated disease was associated with reactivation of prior latent infection.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Although amphotericin B remains the mainstay of therapy for serious fungal infections, numerous acute and chronic toxicities make clinical usage difficult. Nevertheless, utilization of amphotericin B has increased dramatically in recent years. Accordingly, a study to reassess toxicity associated with the use of amphotericin in the modern era and to determine the aggregate impact toxicities have on the overall therapeutic course of patients was undertaken. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 50 patients at our institution who had received amphotericin B were retrospectively reviewed for the occurrence of drug-related acute and chronic toxicities and their impact on therapy. Patients evaluated were at least 21 years of age, had received at least 100 mg of amphotericin B, and were treated for at least 3 days. An analysis to investigate associations between drug administration variables and toxicities was also undertaken. RESULTS: The mean age of study subjects were 54 years, the average duration of therapy was 19 days, and the mean cumulative dose of amphotericin B was 582 mg. Acute toxicities accompanying infusion occurred in 66% of all patients. Fever was experienced by 34% of study subjects and chills by 56%, with rates of 2.6 and 3.5 mean episodes per patient per treatment course, respectively. Other acute toxicities including hypotension were rare, and no patients exhibited bronchospasm or anaphylaxis. Nephrotoxicity occurred in 30 patients (60%). Baseline creatinine values in these patients rose by a mean of 1.55 mg/dL (137 mumol/L), with increases in creatinine ranging from 0.2 to 5.2 mg/dL (18 to 460 mumol/L). Analysis of six drug administration parameters by stepwise multiple linear regression failed to reveal any significant associations with nephrotoxicity. The mean nadir potassium value was 3.1 mEq/L (3.1 mmol/L) (range: 2.3 to 4.8 mEq/L [2.3 mmol/L]), with 45 of 50 patients (90%) receiving potassium supplementation (average daily supplement = 69 mEq). Only increasing amphotericin B concentration was correlated with an increased requirement for potassium supplementation (p less than 0.01, stepwise multiple linear regression). CONCLUSION: Although clinically important toxicities continue to occur with usage of amphotericin B despite current methods of infusion and premedication, these are usually manageable and rarely limit the course of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of bacterial and fungal blood cultures in febrile hospitalized patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all cases of bacteremia and fungemia detected in 446 patients admitted to a university hospital with AIDS or ARC over a 54-month period, and records of all patients with AIDS or ARC, with or without bacteremia, who were admitted during a 12-month subset of the study period. RESULTS: Only four of the 28 cases of fungemia detected during the study period resulted in unique diagnoses of serious fungal infections, and all four patients died prior to discharge. Among the 46 cases of bacteremia diagnosed during the same period, all 36 (78%) with suggestive clinical findings were detected by culturing three times; nine of 10 without such findings were detected by culturing once and all by culturing twice. Medical record review of 132 patients admitted with AIDS or ARC during a 12-month subset of the study period revealed that culturing was common but the yield was low: positive culture rates were 1.9% for fungal cultures and 6.5% for bacterial cultures when clinical findings suggested bacteremia (versus 1.5% without such findings, p less than 0.025). CONCLUSION: Fungal blood cultures had very little clinical value in the population studied, yielding unique diagnoses only in patients near death. In those with fever, but without clinical findings suggesting bacteremia, obtaining bacterial cultures on two occasions was sufficient to detect all cases.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients over 60 years of age treated at the University of Michigan Hospital or Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Medical Center from 1977 to 1987 who had a diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection were reviewed. Early infections were defined as those occurring within 12 months of insertion of the prosthesis; late infections were those occurring more than 12 months after insertion. RESULTS: Fifty-one episodes of infection in 38 elderly patients were reviewed. There were 20 infections in prosthetic hips and 31 infections in prosthetic knees. Twenty-seven infections occurred early and 24 occurred late. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Group D enterococci were the organisms most commonly isolated (33%, 27%, and 24% of episodes, respectively). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli were the causative organisms in approximately a third of the infections, and anaerobic organisms were noted in almost one fourth of episodes. In 33 episodes, the infected device was eventually completely removed, but infection resolved in only 20 of these 33 episodes (61%). In 18 episodes treated without removal of the device, none resolved. Outcome was poor; only five patients could walk without assistance, six patients developed contiguous osteomyelitis, two required amputation, and three died. CONCLUSIONS: Infection of prosthetic joints in elderly patients is a serious disease with poor functional outcome. The device has to be removed in order to clear the infection, and even then the infection is often difficult to eradicate.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report presents data from 26 postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (forearm fracture) 12 months after withdrawal of a 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy with intranasal calcitonin. The women then resumed treatment with calcitonin 200 IU plus calcium 500 mg daily in an open design for an additional 1-year period. A control group of 19 age-matched women (no forearm fracture) did not receive any treatment. RESULTS: At the end of the 3 years, the control group had lost significantly more bone in the forearm (single photon absorptiometry) and spine (dual photon absorptiometry) than had the group treated with intranasal calcitonin for 2 years, whereas the group receiving calcitonin for 1 year had intermediate values. During the year of withdrawal, the rate of bone loss was similar in the women who had received calcitonin and those who had received placebo. Calcitonin was especially effective in women with initially high bone turnover and low bone mass. The bone response in the spine could, furthermore, be estimated by the changes in bone turnover. CONCLUSION: Discontinuous treatment with intranasal calcitonin affects bone and calcium metabolism in established osteoporosis. In women with high-turnover osteoporosis, therapy results in a net gain of bone in both the peripheral and axial skeleton. Response to treatment may be monitored by changes in bone turnover.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specifically, we evaluated clinical, laboratory, and two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic data in 36 patients with multiple myeloma. Cardiac output was determined noninvasively by a pulsed Doppler technique. RESULTS: A high cardiac output state, defined as a cardiac index greater than or equal to 4.0 L/minute/m2, was present in eight of 34 (23.5%) subjects in whom cardiac output was measurable. None of the known causes of high output states could be identified in these patients. Four patients developed high output congestive heart failure, two of whom died. Age, sex, degree of anemia, serum calcium level, immunoglobulin type, or disease stage did not differ significantly between subjects with or without high output states. However, severe bone involvement was significantly more frequent in those patients with high cardiac output states, occurring in all eight patients with high cardiac indexes compared with nine of 26 patients with low or normal cardiac indexes (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that high cardiac output states are relatively common in patients with multiple myeloma and are associated with the presence of extensive bone disease.\r"

  ".U": "90313813\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE, PATIENTS, AND METHODS: Blood coagulation abnormalities are common in patients with cancer, particularly after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy has been associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, and patients treated with chemotherapy often develop evidence of local phlebitis, which may lead to loss of venous access. We have utilized the radioimmunoassay for plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and in vitro FPA generation to assess the rate of in vivo blood coagulation and the level of plasma thrombin activity in 16 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Eight patients were treated twice, once with chemotherapy alone and once with chemotherapy after an intravenous infusion of heparin (5,000 U). RESULTS: Our results confirm that FPA levels are elevated in most cancer patients. Following chemotherapy, FPA levels were further increased within 45 minutes (mean FPA = 5.2 ng/mL before chemotherapy versus 8.3 ng/mL after chemotherapy, p less than 0.01) and were accompanied by an increase in the FPA generation rate. Infusion of heparin prior to chemotherapy significantly lowered plasma FPA levels and abolished post-chemotherapy FPA generation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that patients receiving chemotherapy express thrombin-like activity in plasma and, therefore, may be at risk for clinically significant intravascular activation of coagulation. Heparin diminished the laboratory evidence of this chemotherapy-related coagulopathy and may have a role in the prevention of thromboembolic disorders in some cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with gallstones who have recently experienced biliary tract pain are likely to develop recurrent symptoms in the near future. As a consequence, most symptomatic patients are offered specific treatment. However, disagreement persists regarding which symptoms and signs truly represent symptomatic cholelithiasis. We re-examined the relation of gastrointestinal complaints and physical findings to the presence of gallstones in a clinical population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 2-year period, we identified outpatients of a public teaching hospital for whom diagnostic studies of the gallbladder had been ordered. Patients were interviewed and examined by research personnel prior to completion of the studies. Gastrointestinal symptoms and physical examination findings in 122 patients found to have gallstones were contrasted with those of 178 gallstone-free patients. RESULTS: In comparison to control subjects, patients with gallstones more often reported epigastric pain lasting at least 30 minutes (64.2% versus 45.1%, p less than 0.004). The latter patients infrequently complained of lower abdominal pain (12.3% versus 29.9%, p less than 0.002), but more often described pain radiating to the upper back. Gallstone-associated pain usually occurred more than 1 hour after meals, persisted from 1 to 24 hours, and was steady in quality. Although these differences were statistically significant, likelihood ratio analysis indicated that clinical symptoms and signs were relatively weak discriminators of gallbladder disease. CONCLUSIONS: Upper abdominal pain is the symptom most closely associated with gallstone disease. Radiation to the upper back, a steady quality, duration between 1 and 24 hours, and onset more than an hour after meals support the diagnosis. Nevertheless, gallstone-associated symptoms are non-specific, and accurate diagnosis cannot rely on the clinical assessment alone. Careful clinical evaluation can guide patient selection for diagnostic imaging and the appropriate management of those found to harbor stones.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pulmonary microvascular damage is part of a more generalized involvement of the microvasculature in the spectrum of scleroderma (Scl)-like syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied four groups of patients, all with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), distinguished by the extent and nature of their underlying connective tissue disease. Twenty-two patients had primary RP (pRP), another 22 patients had RP and an undifferentiated connective tissue disease (uCTD), 15 patients had Scl, and eight patients had the CREST syndrome (CREST). Pulmonary vascular damage in these groups was assessed by measuring the pulmonary diffusing capacity (T1,CO) and its components: the diffusing capacity of the alveolocapillary membrane (Dm) and the pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc). Results were compared with morphologic abnormalities of the nailfold capillaries, as determined by nailfold capillary microscopy, and related to the presence of antinuclear antibodies. RESULTS: Vc was below normal in 38% and 43% of patients with pRP and uCTD, respectively (versus 52% in patients with Scl or CREST combined). In contrast, Dm was below normal in only 5% and 26% of patients with pRP and uCTD, respectively (versus 61% in patients with Scl or CREST combined). In patients with Scl and CREST, Dm was significantly decreased as compared with the former groups (p less than 0.01). Dm was also the pulmonary function parameter that correlated most strongly with both nailfold capillary abnormalities and the presence of antinuclear antibodies, whereas Vc did not. CONCLUSION: Early pulmonary involvement in Scl syndromes is functionally characterized by a lowered Dm, correlating with morphologic changes of the nailfold capillaries. Decreased Vc is probably a reflection of RP of the pulmonary vasculature.\r"

Various clinical parameters were reviewed and examined via Fisher's exact test for association with survival. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients who underwent ventilation for a total of 32 episodes of mechanical ventilation comprised our study group. The overall mortality was 22%. A total of 76 complications were documented, including six episodes of barotrauma. The mean duration of artificial ventilation was 114 hours for nonsurvivors and 77 hours for survivors (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although there appears to be a trend toward increased survival after mechanical ventilation for acute asthma, ventilation of critically ill asthmatic patients continues to be a potentially perilous venture associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are alleged to have more frequent or more pronounced alterations of uric acid homeostasis than are seen in most other types of chronic renal diseases. We performed this study to examine the hypothesis that individuals with ADPKD have abnormal uric acid homeostasis that is manifest before the development of renal insufficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 301 subjects, 163 with ADPKD and 138 relatives without ADPKD (NADPKD), by ultrasonography. The subjects were interviewed and examined. Venous blood and two 24-hour urine collections were obtained for uric acid and creatinine determinations. RESULTS: Presence of hyperuricemia, serum uric acid levels, uric acid clearance, and fractional excretion of uric acid did not differ between ADPKD and NADPKD subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/minute/1.73 m2). Clearance of uric acid decreased and fractional excretion increased in subjects with decreased renal function in both groups. Female gender enhanced renal excretion of uric acid in both groups and hypertension depressed it except in men with ADPKD, who had higher fractional excretions of uric acid than did hypertensive NADPKD men. CONCLUSIONS: Uric acid homeostasis is preserved in individuals with ADPKD with normal renal function when compared to unaffected family members. Hyperuricemia and decreased renal excretion of uric acid develop as renal function worsens in ADPKD, similar to that in control subjects. The expected depressing effect of hypertension on renal handling of uric acid was not seen in men with ADPKD, speculatively due to an effect of atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the frequency and to identify predictive factors of occult major illness in febrile intravenous drug users (IVDUs) presenting to an emergency room. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was performed involving a consecutive series of 296 presentations of febrile IVDUs to a public hospital emergency room. Follow-up information was obtained for 283 presentations (95.6%). Physician's initial assessment was obtained for 204 presentations (70%). Illness was classified as major or minor using explicit criteria. Frequency of occult major illness was determined among patients without obvious major illness on presentation. Risk factors for occult major illness were determined. RESULTS: Occult major illness occurred in 11 patients (4%). This represented 11% of the 103 presentations without obvious major illness on presentation. Pneumonia and cellulitis occurred in 128 of 180 patients (71%) with obvious major illness on presentation. Bacteremia was present in seven of 11 patients with occult major illness. Physician predictions were not sufficiently sensitive to provide the basis of the hospitalization decision in febrile IVDUs. The best combination of features suggesting major illness were last use of intravenous drugs less than 5 days and fever greater than 38.8 degrees C (102.0 degrees F) (sensitivity 64%, specificity 77%). CONCLUSION: Clinical tests and physician assessments are unable to distinguish occult major illness from minor illness among febrile IVDUs at presentation. Occult major illness is best identified by blood culture. If patient follow-up is unreliable, then hospitalization of febrile IVDUs, while awaiting blood culture results, remains a wise policy.\r"

Fresnel's equations predict the amount of light transmitted or reflected at optical interfaces. Application of Fresnel's equations demonstrate that significant laser reflection occurs at gas-fluid or fluid-gas interfaces, especially at high angles of incidence. Photocoagulation across gas-fluid or fluid-gas interfaces should be avoided to reduce the risk of unintended damage from reflected light. If photocoagulation must be performed across an interface, the surgeon should minimize the angle of incidence of the treatment laser beam, use a divergent beam, and consider the location and intensity of the reflected beam. Because of the higher phototoxicity of blue light, photocoagulation with blue-green lasers across gas-fluid or fluid-gas interfaces is undesirable. Proper polarization of the treatment laser beam may significantly reduce laser reflectance.\r"

The gradient filter test consists of a series of calibrated photographic fog filter and prism lenses. The combined prism-filter lenses are placed in front of the normal fixing eye. The greatest density (fogging value) filter that causes a switch in fixation from the amblyopic to the normal eye is noted. In both normal eyes of 20 nonamblyopic patients and the fellow (non-amblyopic) eyes of 20 amblyopic patients, visual acuity decreased as the density of the prism-filter lens increased. The gradient filter test accurately detected an improvement in visual acuity when compared with optotype measurements in eight patients undergoing occlusion therapy. The gradient filter test is a useful clinical tool that can assess changes in visual acuity in preverbal children who are being treated for amblyopia.\r"

The patients lived in a hyperendemic area in Sierra Leone, West Africa, where no vector control was instituted. Five months after initial treatment, the microfilarial load in skin and eyes had decreased significantly (P less than .0000), but 28 of 44 (63%) patients had positive skin-snip test results and nine of 29 (31%) patients with ocular involvement had active ocular disease. Twelve months after initial treatment, 15 of 41 (37%) patients had positive skin-snip test results and eight of 26 (31%) showed active ocular involvement. All patients with persistent ocular disease after therapy showed evidence of active onchocerciasis at that time, which suggests that a dose of ivermectin at six-month intervals is not sufficient for intensely infested patients with severe ocular disease. We developed an ocular involvement score to evaluate the patient's total ocular status and observed a significant relation between the pretreatment severity of ocular involvement and the persistence of active ocular disease after treatment with ivermectin.\r"

We used photographs to document the variability among 26 normal subjects. Hydroxyamphetamine hydrobromide 1% eyedrops (Paredrine) were placed in both eyes of normal subjects in the same way that patients with Horner's syndrome are tested. The drug produced a mean increase in pupil size of 1.96 mm (+/- 0.61 S.D.) in the 52 eyes tested. In normal subjects, the mydriatic effect of hydroxyamphetamine was symmetric in each pair of eyes. The mean interocular asymmetry of mydriasis as measured by the difference in dilation (right eye dilation minus left eye dilation) was -0.087 mm (+/- 0.29 S.D.). Thus, the variability of hydroxyamphetamine mydriasis from one eye to the other in a single subject was much lower than the variability between subjects.\r"

When epinephrine at a dilution of 1:1,000 was injected directly into the anterior chamber of New Zealand white rabbits, there was markedly less corneal edema induced than there was in previous studies with sulfite-containing solutions of comparably low pH but higher buffer capacities. Although potential toxicity exists for any irrigating solution with a pH outside of the 6.5 to 8.5 pH range, the endothelial toxicity of this solution has been reduced by its low buffer capacity, lack of preservatives, and lack of sulfite, offering an extra margin of safety for intraocular use.\r"

  ".W": "Public health's promise for the future is inextricably related to efforts which maximize human potential and which realize the world's interdependence. Public health challenges are not only constant and complex but frequently surrounded by political activities. In this environment, the public health enterprise has been enhanced by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences' report on The Future of Public Health and the assessment framework it provides. Risk reduction through preventive and health promotion activities is the primary focus of public health, but facilitation is often dependent upon society's understanding and willingness-to-pay for such services. The effectiveness of public health is related to an ability to coordinate public and private efforts at national, state, and local levels. Also in this environment, public health is empowered through its multidisciplinary approach. However, epidemiology provides a unifying framework for the collective public health effort. Based on the use of epidemiology, public health is empowered to make the argument for a national health program and to support the concept of health as a determinant of life options. Public health's promise for the future can be fulfilled by continuing to increase its scientific base for decision-making, by self-examination and correction, by advocating and promoting self-examination and correction, by advocating and promoting social justice and by promoting firm partnerships with the public.\r"

Employer self-reporting indicates a large proportion of potentially lead-exposed workers have never participated in a monitoring program. Only 2.6 percent of facilities have done environmental monitoring for lead, and only 1.4 percent have routine biological monitoring programs. Monitoring practices vary by size of facility, with higher proportions in industries in which larger facilities predominate. Almost 80 percent of battery manufacturing employees work in job classifications which have been monitored, versus only 1 percent of radiator-repair workers. These findings suggest that laboratory-based surveillance for occupational lead poisoning may seriously underestimate the true number of lead poisoned workers and raise serious questions regarding compliance with key elements of the OSHA Lead Standard.\r"

Charcoal adsorption detectors and diffusion barrier charcoal adsorption detectors performed very well, and the latter detectors displayed excellent time averaging ability. Alternatively, charcoal liquid scintillation detectors exhibited acceptable accuracy but poor precision, and bare alpha registration detectors showed both poor accuracy and precision. The mean randon level reported by the bare alpha registration detectors was 68 percent lower than the radon reference level.\r"

Between April and December 1987, the California Department of Health Services received 3,077 blood lead reports from 34 laboratories for 1,293 civilian, non-institutionalized adults. Approximately 1 percent of all reports exceeded 3.87 mumols/L (80 micrograms/dl), 7 percent exceeded 2.42 mumols/L (50 micrograms/dl), and 21 percent exceeded 1.93 mumols/L (40 micrograms/dl). Individuals tested were overwhelmingly male (94 percent), disproportionately Hispanic surnamed (44 percent), and most often residents of Los Angeles County (81 percent). Workers in lead smelting, battery manufacturing, and brass foundries accounted for nearly 80 percent of reports. Construction, radiator repair, pottery and ceramics manufacturing, and gun firing ranges accounted for the remainder. All adults with reports of greater than or equal to 2.90 mumols/L who were contacted reported on occupational exposure. Approximately half were not in routine medical monitoring programs. Despite OSHA standards, elevated blood lead with the potential for serious acute and chronic lead poisoning in California adults remains a significant public health and major occupational health concern.\r"

Uterine cancer incidence rates using SEER data have continued to decline since 1979. An acceleration in the decline since 1983-84 is suggested in all women and in women with intact uteri ages 45-64. Hospitalizations for uterine cancer have also declined since 1979, with a marked acceleration in the decline since 1983-84 for all women and for women ages 40-79 has increased 22 percent and use of unopposed exogenous estrogens in women of similar age has increased 7 percent, while use of exogenous progesterones have shown much more substantial increases of approximately 700 percent. Possible relationships between trends in exogenous hormone use and incidence rates of corpus uterine cancer are discussed.\r"

When all categories of radiographic osteoarthritis were aggregated into a single \"arthritis\" variable and dependence upon human assistance in one or more functional activities combined into a single variable, elders with osteoarthritis had only moderately increased odds for dependence after controlling for age or sex (OR = 1.25). A definition of osteoarthritis based only upon symptoms produced larger odds for dependency (OR = 1.85). Elders with mild osteoarthritis and infrequent knee pain had no significantly elevated risk for dependence in any of the seven functional activities. Elders with infrequently symptomatic, moderate to marked radiographic osteoarthritis were at increased risk for dependence in stair climbing, walking a mile, housekeeping, and carrying bundles. Elder with radiographic osteoarthritis accompanied by frequent pain had an increased odds of dependence in stair climbing, walking a mile, and housekeeping. Using a generic definition of \"arthritis\" and aggregating functional activities may underestimate the impact of osteoarthritis on physical disability in the elderly and obscure the task-specific nature of that relationship.\r"

The time of TB diagnosis was centrally distributed around the time of AIDS diagnosis; from this, it was determined that 4.1 percent of AIDS patients develop active TB. Projections for future AIDS cases were made by fitting a polynomial model to historical data. These projections were then used to predict the future impact of AIDS-related TB upon state TB rates. The rise in TB rates call for special efforts to minimize this impact.\r"

Those men who died of lung cancer (n = 119) were either cigarette smokers at entry or ex-smokers; no lung cancer deaths occurred among the 1,859 men who reported never smoking cigarettes. The risk of lung cancer for smokers, adjusted for selected baseline variables using a Cox proportional hazards model, increased as the number of cigarettes smoked increased (B = 0.0203, SE = 0.0076). There was not the same graded response for CHD among smokers at entry. The risk of CHD death was greater among smokers than nonsmokers (RR = 1.57) (B = -0.0034, S.E. = 0.0048). After one year of cessation, the relative risk of dying of CHD for the quitters as compared to non-quitters (RR = 0.63) was significantly lower even after adjusting for baseline differences and changes in other risk factors. The relative risk for smokers who quit for at least the first three years of the trial was even lower compared to non-quitters (RR = 0.38). However, the relative risk for lung cancer for quitters versus non-quitters was close to 1 both for quitters at 12 months and at three years. These data support the benefits of cessation in relation to CHD and are consistent with other epidemiologic studies which suggest that the lag time for a beneficial effect of smoking cessation on lung cancer may be as long as 20 years.\r"

A community-based sample of 1,023 females ages 13 to 19 years was interviewed in 1984-85; 874 (85.4 percent) were reinterviewed approximately two years later. Mexico-born Mexican Americans have the lowest rate of early sexual intercourse, but the highest rate of early births because they are most likely to become pregnant if sexually active, and most likely to have a birth if pregnant. Non-Hispanic Whites have the highest rate of early sexual intercourse, but the lowest rate of early births because pregnant non-Hispanic Whites terminate pregnancies most often. US-born Mexican Americans are intermediate between the other two groups. Delays in the onset of sexual activity among Mexican Americans are not converted into corresponding delays in first pregnancies and births. Early marriage among Mexico-born Mexican Americans, however, accounts for much of the ethnic difference in early fertility.\r"

We interviewed 227 women with a tubal pregnancy who had no clinical indication of infertility and no history of sterilization and 674 similarly defined controls who were matched to the cases on age and county of residence. A history of condom use for more than one year was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent tubal pregnancy (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.44, 1.26) adjusted for the effects of age, current use of contraceptive methods, educational level, and age at first intercourse. The effect was more pronounced when condoms had been used during five-year periods with more than one partner (RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.15, 1.0) than during five-year periods with one partner (RR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.76). Condom use for less than one year was unrelated to risk of ectopic pregnancy. Since the use of condoms offers protection against sexually transmitted diseases, one or more of which are likely to be causally related to tubal pregnancy, the observed negative association plausibly represents a protective influence of long-term condom use on the occurrence of tubal pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Predictors of unprotected anal intercourse were examined among 508 gay men in San Francisco. The cohort was recruited in 1983-84 at which time 49.8 percent of non-monogamous men (N = 435) and 71.2 percent of monogamous men (N = 73) reported practicing unprotected anal intercourse. Only 12 percent of non-monogamous and 27.4 percent of monogamous men reported these practices in 1988. The non-monogamous men who practiced unprotected anal intercourse in 1984 were more likely to be younger, to report that unprotected anal intercourse was their favorite sexual activity, to be low in perceived efficacy to change sexual behavior, to report that friends were more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, to have less knowledge of health guidelines, and to be less depressed at that time. Non-monogamous individuals who in 1984 reported that unprotected anal intercourse was their favorite sexual activity were more likely to practice that behavior in 1988. Those who knew their serostatus as positive were less likely to report unprotected anal intercourse in 1988. These data infer that in order to modify AIDS-related high-risk behaviors, community risk-reduction programs be differentially aimed at young persons so as to increase personal efficacy about risk reduction, challenge peer norms, promote antibody testing, and eroticize safer sexual activities.\r"

It does not seem realistic, at present, to propose OLT as the only effective treatment of variceal bleeding for a variety of reasons, and there remains a large group of patients who are noncompliant or unsuitable for liver transplantation. We propose that initial bleeding be controlled by endoscopic sclerotherapy, thereby allowing careful evaluation to be made electively. Grade A patients appear to be managed best by a reduced-size portacaval shunt (RPS) with prospects of good survival and few complications. Grade B patients can be managed by either sclerotherapy, RPS, or OLT, depending upon individual circumstances. Grade C patients are best managed by liver transplantation, again with excellent survival. In those grade C patients not deemed suitable for OLT (especially alcoholic patients), long-term endoscopic sclerotherapy is the best option. Changes in patient status may sometimes require revision of the treatment decision.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 9-year period, 58 patients who had previous portasystemic shunt procedures underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) under a cyclosporine-steroid immunosuppressive regimen. The types of shunt used were distal splenorenal (18 patients), mesocaval (17 patients), end-to-side portacaval (11 patients), side-to-side portacaval (5 patients) and proximal splenorenal (7 patients). The mean interval between shunt and transplantation was 6 years. There was no statistical difference in survival between patients with previous shunts and the entire population of patients with primary liver transplantation performed during the same period of time. Age, sex, shunt patency, status of portal vein, and use of vein or artery graft did not affect survival. Child's classification had a significant influence on graft survival, even though no difference was subsequently observed in patient survival. A progressively improved intraoperative strategy and the use of veno-venous bypass and University of Wisconsin preservation solution had a significant impact on blood loss, length of operation, length of stay in intensive care unit, and ultimately, on survival. Distal splenorenal and mesocaval shunts with no or minimal hilum dissection are safer shunts if subsequent transplantation is planned; in fact, their 9-year survival was 87%, whereas all other shunts were associated with a survival no better than 52% (p less than 0.006).\r"

Physiologically, such patients differ from patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding in that they have a normal liver and maintain good portal perfusion through hepatopedal collaterals. Complete evaluation of these patients requires identification of the bleeding site by endoscopy, definition of the anatomy by angiography, and confirmation of a normal liver by biopsy examination. Causative factors, including hypercoagulable states, should be evaluated. Therapeutic options range from noninterventive, through ablative procedures, to shunt operations. The goal should be definitive control of bleeding and return to a normal lifestyle. Distal splenorenal shunt offers the best option if technically feasible, but if no shuntable veins are patent, ablative procedures and sclerotherapy may be required. A noninterventive, noninvestigational approach is inappropriate in patients who can be offered definitive therapy. Splenectomy for hypersplenism should not be done in these patients.\r"

The estimated probability of bleeding from the varices and the cause of the varices should be investigated. If cirrhosis is detected, then its cause or mechanism should be clarified and the activity of the process estimated in semiquantitative terms. If therapy is available, it should be initiated. The evaluation of liver function is based on quantitative measurements of hepatocellular metabolic function (such as the galactose elimination capacity or antipyrine clearance), liver volume (weight), liver blood flow, and systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output index).\r"

  ".W": "In a 7-year period, 692 patients were admitted to the Heinz-Kalk Hospital with bleeding esophageal varices. All patients were first treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES). Fourteen patients exsanguinated during the first 2 hours of admission or refused treatment. Long-term injection sclerotherapy was performed in 311 Child-Pugh C patients. Among the remaining 367 patients, 182 were in class A and 185, class B. In 194 patients, ES was successful. In 173 patients with at least two rebleeding episodes despite long-term sclerotherapy, specific selection criteria were used to assess suitability for a shunt. Eighty-eight patients received a shunt: 54, a narrow-lumen mesocaval (NLMS) shunt; 32, a distal splenorenal shunt; 1, a portacaval shunt; and 1, a proximal splenorenal Linton shunt. There was no significant difference in mortality at 30 days; however, late mortality in the ES group was 36% and in the shunt group, 17%. This difference was statistically significant in favor of the shunt operation (p less than 0.01). Thus, using specific selection criteria, shunt procedures performed in Child-Pugh class A and B patients are the best form of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices resistant to long-term ES. Furthermore, the narrow-lumen mesocaval shunt is a good alternative to the distal splenorenal shunt if the latter is technically impossible to perform or hemodynamically not advisable.\r"

The left gastric venacaval shunt functions well over a long postoperative period, if the shunt is technically satisfactory; however, the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) can be problematic. Unless the proximal and distal portions of the splenic vein are both entirely isolated from the pancreas, blood flow will be diverted from the portal vein to the distal splenic vein, where the pressure has been lowered by the shunt. This portal malcirculation may lead to portal thrombosis or stenosis on occasion. To prevent this adverse effect, complete isolation of the splenic vein (splenopancreatic disconnection) is necessary. Extensive gastric disconnection is irrelevant in this regard. Although the conventional DSRS has been viewed with disfavor, we must realize that splenopancreatic disconnection makes the DSRS a satisfactory technique. The clinical evidence and theoretic basis of the selective shunt for esophageal varices are described herein.\r"

Despite fewer varices in all of the patients, variceal rebleeding and death occurred in one patient (2%). Late portal perfusion was observed in 91% of the patients, with worsening in 23%, compared with the preoperative study. Persistent hepatocyte necrosis and incomplete SPD were the most significant prognostic factors for decreased perfusion (presence and absence of necrosis, 38% and 12%, respectively; DSRS and DSRS with SPD, 43% and 12%, respectively). SPD also decreased ongoing hepatocyte damage. Post-shunt encephalopathy was clinically evident in 7% of the patients, but after electroencephalographic evaluation, it increased to 24.6%. Significant factors in its development included decreased portal perfusion (62% versus 14%), active hepatitis (48% versus 17%), and incomplete SPD (43% versus 14%).

Gastric fundal variceal rebleeding did not occur in 44 patients undergoing splenopancreatic disconnection. Postoperative encephalopathy occurred in 13% of patients; however, it did not occur at all in noncirrhotic patients. Prograde portal venous perfusion was preserved in 77% of patients. Fifteen alternate selective operations to the Warren shunt were performed, usually because of antecedent splenectomy.

Additional options now include selective shunts, devascularization procedures, endoscopic sclerotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and hepatic transplantation. Although drug treatment is experimental at the present time, the remaining therapeutic options are applicable to various subgroups of patients and in certain clinical settings. At the University of Nebraska, patients with variceal bleeding are first grouped based on their candidacy for transplantation. Transplantation candidates with advanced (Child's class C) or symptomatic liver disease undergo transplantation as soon as possible. Future transplantation candidates with stable, asymptomatic liver disease undergo either long-term sclerotherapy or a distal splenorenal shunt if sclerotherapy fails or if they have poor access to tertiary medical care. These patients are carefully monitored so that they can undergo transplantation before they become high-operative risks. Patients who are not candidates for transplantation receive chronic variceal sclerotherapy as initial therapy so long as shunt surgery is readily available if sclerotherapy fails. When surgery is indicated, the distal splenorenal shunt is preferred to nonselective shunts because several controlled and uncontrolled series have demonstrated a lower frequency of encephalopathy after selective variceal decompression.\r"

One hundred sixty-seven of the procedures were elective. Operative mortality was 14%, and survival for the Child's class A group was 75% at 1 year, 69% at 5 years, and 65% at 15 years. Incapacitating encephalopathy was observed in 7% of the patients, rebleeding in 6%, and shunt thrombosis in 6%.

Prevention of bleeding with propranolol has given conflicting results in controlled trials, but is a safe treatment. Prophylactic sclerotherapy has been shown to reduce bleeding in European studies, but this has not been confirmed by studies in the United States. Acute variceal bleeding can usually be controlled by sclerotherapy, which may be supplemented by pharmacotherapy with vasopressin, nitroglycerin, or somatostatin. Recurrent bleeding is prevented initially by sclerotherapy, with surgery reserved for patients who have not responded to this treatment. Once bleeding has been controlled, the suitability and timing of hepatic transplantation must be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Herein we report the results and current status of the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) in China. From June 1979 to June 1989, the DSRS was performed in 302 patients with esophagogastric varices. Among a group of 249 patients, 112 were in Child's class A, 97 were in class B, and 40 were in class C. The cause of portal hypertension was posthepatic cirrhosis in 217 patients, schistosomiasis in 28 patients, alcoholic cirrhosis in 3 patients, and biliary cirrhosis in 1 patient. Therapeutic selective shunts were performed in 200 patients with variceal bleeding, and 102 patients received prophylactic shunts. Emergency operations were performed in 10 patients. The original Warren shunt was performed in 264 patients, and various modifications in 38 patients. Simultaneous ligation of the splenic artery was performed in 202 patients. The overall operative mortality rate was 6%. A 3-month to 10-year follow-up demonstrated an 8% recurrent bleeding rate, a 1% incidence of encephalopathy, and a survival rate ranging from 72.3% to 100%. From the preliminary results obtained, we conclude that DSRS is effective and safe in the treatment of esophagogastric variceal bleeding. It can also be used as a prophylactic procedure in Child's class A and B patients.\r"

Effective medical and surgical treatments have led to changes in management strategy and to diversity in treatment during the last decade. The timing of treatment, the nature of the disease, the patient's liver function, and the distribution of collaterals should all be considered in selecting treatment.\r"

Neither the onset of toxicity nor the severity of symptoms is well predicted by serum theophylline concentrations. Since depressed vitamin B6 plasma levels can occur in patients receiving theophylline, we explored a B6-theophylline interaction in a rabbit model. Administration of theophylline preparations intraperitoneally (aminophylline) or orally (sustained release anhydrous theophylline) resulted in a 47% depression of plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels. The 87% increase in PLP with pyridoxine administration was only 18% when aminophylline was also given. The mechanism of the theophylline-B6 interaction is obscure. Ethylenediamine in some theophylline preparations binds directly to PLP, potentially increasing the less direct theophylline effect. Pyridoxine supplementation resulted in higher average PLP levels but did not prevent death in animals with profoundly low PLP levels. If these data apply to humans, B6 deficiency may contribute to chronic theophylline toxicity; however, pyridoxine administration in the dosage used may not prevent toxicity. Larger doses may prove beneficial after further investigation.\r"

Natural killer function normalized, but therapy was discontinued after 4 months; however, no clinical benefits from IFN administration were observed. Further in vitro evaluation of NK function and lymphokine production is needed, in order eventually to offer more effective immunomodulating agents to such patients.

Many factors contribute to airway inflammation in asthma including, possibly, airway instrumentation. To establish whether BAL leads to diffuse airway inflammation in stable asthmatics, we performed paired BAL studies (24 h apart) in eight subjects with mild asthma whose prebronchoscopy spirometric results were similar on both days. Airflow limitation did not occur in any subject after bronchoscopy. We observed no significant changes in BAL volume return, cell differential, lymphocyte subsets, reactive oxygen species metabolism by air-space cells, or BAL total protein. There was a slight increase in second-day BAL total cell return. We conclude that bronchoscopy and BAL in stable asthmatics with mild disease is not associated with evidence of diffuse airway inflammation.\r"

Three patterns of decompensation were established according to the delay between the onset of symptoms and endotracheal intubation: Group I, rapid decompensation (less than 3 hours); Group II, gradual development of respiratory failure (9.2 +/- 7.7 days); Group III, acute exacerbation after unstable asthma (4.2 +/- 3.6 days). Patients who developed sudden asphyxia (Group I) showed features distinct from those with a gradual worsening. Sudden asphyxic asthma is more frequent in young men and is characterized by a severe mixed acidosis with extreme hypercapnia (mean PaCO2 = 112.8 +/- 43.9 mm Hg), a higher incidence of respiratory arrest, and silent chest upon admission. Recovery is more rapid, with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (33.7 +/- 25.3 h versus 91.4 +/- 64.1 h in Group II). Several arguments suggest that bronchospasm plays the primary role in the pathogenesis of sudden asphyxic asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Low density, or hypodense eosinophils (HE) are found in increased numbers in asthma. Since HE have been reported to have increased inflammatory potential and correlate with the severity of airway obstruction, it has been suggested that this subpopulation of eosinophils may contribute to the asthma process. However, investigations to define the function of HE in asthma have been limited. In this study, pure populations of both HE and normal dense eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of seven patients with asthma, and functional activity of these cells was determined by measuring superoxide (O2-) generation to several activators. Compared to normal dense eosinophils, HE generated significantly more O2- when activated with the chemotactic peptide FMLP or opsonized zymosan; however, these differences were small. In contrast, no difference was observed in O2- production between normal- and low-density eosinophils from asthma patients when stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or the calcium ionophore A23187. Furthermore, both eosinophil populations, and corresponding neutrophil isolates, from asthma patients generated significantly more O2- than control granulocytes when activated by PMA. When stimulated by calcium ionophore, all three eosinophil populations released equivalent amounts of O2-, which were, however, higher than from both neutrophil suspensions. Compared to increased activity found in some other hypereosinophilic conditions, blood HE in asthma do not necessarily have enhanced function. This suggests that eosinophil heterogeneity extends not only to cell density but is also reflected in cell function and that these cell variations are dependent on many factors, including the function assessed, source of cells (normal versus patients with some diseases), and stimulus used.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine and certain cyclooxygenase products of arachidonic acid have been implicated as mediators of inflammation and are potent constrictors of human airways. Because asthma may represent manifestations of chronic inflammation of the airways, the levels of histamine and six prostanoid mediators were measured in airway fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 12 normal, 11 allergic rhinitic, and 15 asymptomatic, allergic asthmatic subjects. Simultaneous profiling of prostanoid mediators in individual samples was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Levels of PGD2, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 and PGF2 alpha were 12 to 22 times higher in asthmatic than in normal subjects (p less than 0.01), with concentrations in airway fluids of asthmatic subjects after correction for dilution of 3.8, 0.5, and 1.4 nanomolar, respectively. Levels of PGD2 and 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2 were increased nearly tenfold in asthmatic subjects compared with those in rhinitic subjects (p less than 0.01), distinguishing the subjects with lower airway disease from those with another atopic condition. Histamine levels were increased fourfold in asthmatic subjects compared with those in normal subjects (p less than 0.001); however, similar increases were found in rhinitic subjects. We conclude that elevated levels of multiple mediators with potent bronchoconstricting activity are present in the airways of subjects with mild asthma, indicating that even mild disease is associated with evidence of airway inflammation. The interactions of bronchoconstricting mediators and airway inflammation may play important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of the late asthmatic response has been of interest due to the fact that its development has been associated with airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness: all features of chronic asthma. In order to study more precisely late responses, a number of animal models have been developed. Previous reports have described alterations in airway mechanics at both 3 to 6 and 17 h after antigen challenge in sensitized guinea pigs. In these experiments, however, animals were challenged through the nose with aerosolized antigen, and airway conductance was measured using whole body plethysmography while the animals breathed through the upper airways. In rats similarly challenged, the predominant immediate change in resistance occurs in the upper airways. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the contribution made by both the upper and lower airways to late changes after allergen challenge in guinea pigs. Outbred female Hartley guinea pigs were actively or passively sensitized (IgG1 antibody response) to three different antigens and challenged either by direct tracheal insufflation (sheep gamma globulin [SGG] or oxazolone-human serum albumin [OX-HSA]) or by aerosolization (ovalbumin [OA]). Lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were measured in anesthetized guinea pigs through a tracheostomy tube, and specific airway conductance (SGaw) was measured in unanesthetized, nose-breathing guinea pigs using a whole body plethysmograph. Late responses were defined as a RL greater than the mean + 2 SD RL or as a decrease in SGaw from baseline greater than 2 SD from the placebo-challenged (bovine serum albumin) group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data from 100 consecutive patients referred for sleep study for suspected sleep apnea were used to develop the model using logistic regression analysis. For each subject, the model predicted the probability of having an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 15; this probability was compared with the AHI measured from sleep study. A probability cutoff point (= 0.15) was decided on that minimized the number of subjects with false-negative predictions. Four terms--apneas observed by bed partner, hypertension, body mass index, and age--were found to contribute significantly to the model with observed apneas being by far the most predictive term of the four (adjusted odds ratio 19.7). When the model was tested to estimate the probability of an AHI greater than 15 for 105 patients from a second group of consecutive patients referred for sleep study, the model correctly classified 33 of 36 patients with a measured AHI greater than 15 (sensitivity = 92%) and 35 of 69 patients with a measured AHI less than or equal to 15(specificity = 51%). This study shows that analysis of clinical features of patients presenting with suspected sleep apnea may reduce the need for sleep studies by about one-third yet still lead to the identification of the great majority of patients with abnormal breathing during sleep.\r"

Decreasing concentrations of chloride induced dose-related coughing, which was inhibited by furosemide. Thus, chloride-free solution induced 13.1 +/- 1.6 coughs after placebo and 8.4 +/- 1.9 coughs after furosemide (p less than 0.005). In a separate study, six of the same normal subjects were given inhaled furosemide or placebo before inhaling one breath of capsaicin solution given in three consecutive increasing concentrations. Capsaicin induced dose-related coughing, which was not inhibited by furosemide. Thus, after placebo the highest concentration of capsaicin induced 20.8 +/- 1.8 coughs and after furosemide, 21.5 +/- 2.7 coughs.

  ".W": "The effects of passive tobacco smoke exposure upon respiratory symptoms and lung function were assessed in a cross-sectional survey of 770 children 7 yr of age, using cotinine as a quantitative biochemical marker of exposure. Salivary cotinine levels were strongly related to the number of smokers in the home, but three-quarters of children from nonsmoking households had detectable salivary cotinine, and 10% of this group were in the upper two-fifths of the distribution of measured tobacco smoke exposure. Smoking by persons other than members of the household may deserve greater attention in future studies of young children. After adjustment for housing tenure, most respiratory symptoms were unrelated to salivary cotinine, but a \"tendency for colds to go to the chest\" was twice as prevalent in the upper two-fifths as in the lower two-fifths of the cotinine distribution. No association was found between salivary cotinine and reports of wheeze or measured reduction in FEV1 after 6 min of free running. After adjustment for sex, height, test conditions, and housing tenure, all baseline spirometric indices except FVC were inversely associated with salivary cotinine. Only FEF75-85 and FEF75 were significantly reduced, the difference for each index between the top and bottom quintiles of the cotinine distribution being about 7%, equivalent to a reduction of 1.1% (95% CL, 0.1 to 2.1%) per doubling of cotinine concentration. These changes may be evidence of small airways damage, which could later progress to more severe respiratory impairment.\r"
