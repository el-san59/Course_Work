In this article, the authors discuss the process of responsibility charting and illustrate how it can be used to clarify the roles of the many different people whose work may be affected by the implementation of new programs and procedures. Responsibility charting is a structured process for establishing sound patterns of communications and collaboration over time.\r"

HDL cholesterol levels fell by 0.19 mmol/l in the carbohydrate group and rose by 0.03 mmol/l in the olive oil group. Serum triglycerides rose by 0.19 mmol/l in the carbohydrate group and fell by 0.06 mmol/l in the olive oil group. The changes in both HDL and triglycerides were larger in men than in women. These results clearly show that the olive-oil-rich diet, unlike the complex-carbohydrate-rich diet, caused a specific fall in non-HDL cholesterol while leaving serum triglyceride levels virtually unchanged.\r"

We have detected a multidrug resistance phenotype in two patients with drug resistant ANLL by an immunocytochemical assay using a monoclonal antibody to P-glycoprotein. Sequential analysis of peripheral blood samples from both patients showed a progressive increase in both the intensity of staining and the proportion of leukaemic cells that bound antibody as the disease progressed. The assay is simple, and may have prognostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

There were progressive inverse relations between adipose linoleic acid and platelet-membrane eicosapentaenoic acid and the estimated relative risk of AP. These relations were statistically independent of each other and traditional CHD risk factors. For AMI there was a progressive inverse relation between adipose linoleic acid and the estimated relative risk, but it was confounded by smoking habit. Smokers consume less linoleic acid than non-smokers. Although eicosapentaenoic acid in platelet membranes was lower in AMI patients than in controls, this difference was not significant. The estimated proportionate increase in risk of AP, independent of other CHD risk factors, was 1.2 (1.1-1.3) for a 1% decrease in linoleic acid or a 0.1% decrease in eicosapentaenoic acid.\r"

There was noradrenergic denervation and adrenomedullary failure but baroreflex afferents, cholinergic innervation, and adrenocortical function were intact. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were undetectable in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but dopamine was 7-fold to 12-fold normal in plasma, 4-fold normal in urine, and 20-fold normal in CSF. Measurements of catecholamine metabolites showed further evidence for impairment of noradrenaline and adrenaline biosynthesis due to deficient dopamine-beta-hydroxylation. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was undetectable in plasma and CSF. Physiological and pharmacological stimuli of sympathetic neurotransmitter release caused increases in plasma dopamine rather than plasma noradrenaline.\r"

There were significant increases with time in the readmission rates for both sexes. For the women, these were due to a complex interrelation between age, period, and cohort effects. This rising readmission rate may have contributed to the widely held impression that the incidence of anorexia nervosa has risen sharply.\r"

AGT activity, assayed in unfractionated liver tissue, ranged from 11 to 47% of the mean control value, and appeared to be related to the clinical severity of PH and to several biochemical variables which indicate the degree of pathophysiological derangement. There was no difference between patients and controls in the activities of glutamate: glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGT, EC 2.6.1.4) or catalase (EC 1.11.1.6). In the five most severe cases residual AGT activity could be largely accounted for by the crossover from another enzyme, presumably GGT. PH can be diagnosed using percutaneous hepatic needle biopsy and assay of AGT, whose activity may be useful in determining the prognosis and likely severity of the disease.\r"

Anti-SLA-positive serum samples were negative for antinuclear and liver-kidney-microsomal antibodies, markers of two subgroups of autoimmune-type CAH, 6 anti-SLA-positive patients were negative for all autoantibodies sought. Most of the anti-SLA-positive patients were young women (2 men, 21 women; mean age 37 years) with hypergammaglobulinaemia (mean 3.2 g/l, range 1.8-5.3 g/l); 18 of the 23 patients had received immunosuppressive treatment and all responded well. Anti-SLA titres declined during therapy, corresponding to disease activity. Anti-SLA cannot be detected by immunofluorescence. SLA is not organ-specific or species-specific, but the highest concentrations were found in liver and kidney. Anti-SLA autoantibodies characterise a third subgroup of autoimmune-type CAH and will allow a better differentiation of HBsAg-negative CAH which has therapeutic consequences.\r"

Design of the roofs of many Sudanese buildings allows black bats to roost; guano drops through cracks in the ceiling into the rooms below where it can be inhaled and cause allergic respiratory disorders. Seven atopic patients seen at Sennar Hospital with bat-related case-histories were investigated. Six had bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis and one had asthma alone. Extracts of yellow hairy bat, black bat, and bat droppings were made. All seven patients had a positive skin prick test and specific IgE antibodies (RAST) to bat droppings. Three patients also had a positive RAST to both yellow and black bats and one patient to yellow bat. Droppings are probably the major allergen source in bat-related respiratory allergy.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) on gas exchange was studied in ten patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure precipitated by bacterial pneumonia. Mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) improved significantly (79 +/- 16 mm Hg to 98 +/- 20 mm Hg) but the response varied between patients: five showed substantial responses (27-42 mm Hg), three lesser responses (7-9 mm Hg), and two no response. Similar changes were found in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and the ratio of PaO2 to fractional inspired oxygen concentration. In two responders studied further, PaO2 had fallen to baseline values 4-6 h later and a repeat indomethacin challenge again increased PaO2 by greater than 25 mm Hg with concomitant changes in pulmonary shunt. There were no significant changes in the other gas-exchange or haemodynamic variables measured and there was no clear reason for the variability in response to indomethacin. These results suggest a role for products of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in the pathogenesis of hypoxaemia in patients with severe bacterial pneumonia.\r"

The mean titre of IgG antibodies to early antigen was significantly higher in patients than controls. EBV reactivation may be important in the pathogenesis of NDPH. Alternatively, patients with NDPH may be unusually prone to EBV reactivation.\r"

  ".W": "Statistical analyses suggest that 25-50% of the salt intake of Western populations is derived from the discretionary use of cooking and table salt. Yet direct estimates of discretionary salt use by a lithium technique show that in one community in Britain this source contributed only 15% to total intake. The estimates of discretionary salt use in Finland, the United States, and Britain have been exaggerated because salt losses in cooking water were not considered. Only about a quarter of cooking salt actually enters the consumed food; allowance for this in statistical calculations makes data on dietary intake similar to those assessed from urinary sodium excretion. Daily salt intake in Britain averages about 10.7 g for adult men and 8.0 g for women, figures similar to those from countries in northern Europe. The natural salt content of food provides about 10% intake, the remaining 75% being derived from salt added by manufacturers; drinking water provides a negligible amount. Any programme for reducing the salt consumption of a population should therefore concentrate primarily on a reduction in the salt used during food processing.\r"

Normal control tears were negative for HTLV-III. Based upon these findings, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued precautions to prevent any possible spread of the virus by this route. Although there is no evidence to suggest transmission of HTLV-III by contact with the tears, until more is known about the possible transmissibility and infectious dose of this virus, such precautions should be taken during ophthalmic examination.\r"

  ".U": "87117560\r", 
  ".W": "The judicial system regards nursing as an occupation that, for the most part, possesses a body of knowledge that is not known to lay persons. However, according to the courts, nursing does not possess a monopoly on that knowledge, since physicians also possess nursing knowledge. Until recently the courts implied that physicians not only possessed nursing knowledge, but possessed it to a superior degree. The ability of the physician to testify to nursing knowledge is rarely questioned and even when questioned, it has been allowed. Courts are confused about the relative independence of nurses from physicians and are reluctant to find nurses liable when they are following physicians' orders. However, courts do expect nurses to exercise independent judgment in the implementation of those orders. Recently, trial level courts have demanded that nurses take affirmative steps to protect patients from the negligent acts of physicians and have found nurses liable for failure to do so. This is true despite the clear statutory mandate that nurses are not competent to diagnose and treat medical conditions. When nurse practitioners engage in acts that could be construed as diagnosis, one state supreme court found they are entitled to be held to a standard of care separate from that of a physician. In so doing, the court recognized nursing as a distinct profession, entitled to its own standard of care, even when performing traditional medical acts.\r"

Only 1 of 18 normal cats in the cattery showed serologic evidence of infection with this new virus, whereas 10 of 25 cats with signs of ill health were seropositive for the virus. Tentatively designated feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus, this new feline retrovirus appears to be antigenically distinct from human immunodeficiency virus. There is no evidence for cat-to-human transmission of the agent. Kittens experimentally infected by way of blood or plasma from naturally infected animals developed generalized lymphadenopathy several weeks later, became transiently febrile and leukopenic, and continued to show a generalized lymphadenopathy 5 months after infection.\r"

The system-wide prevalence of anti-HBc was 2.60 percent, with a range of 0.55 to 6.38 percent, depending on geographic region. For the American Red Cross, which collects approximately one-half of the blood supply in the United States, excluding donated blood with anti-HBc would result in a loss of approximately 159,500 units during the first year.\r"

Antibodies were not detected in any of the other factor-specific substrates. Virus could not be isolated from any of the seropositive samples after 28 days in culture. Heat treatment of the samples under conditions known to inactivate HIV in plasma products indicated that heating the lyophilized substrate plasmas at 60 degrees C for up to eight hours had little effect on factor substrates and factor assays. Progressive loss of Factor V in the deficient plasmas was the most serious effect produced by heat treatment.\r"

Both the alternative and classical pathways were functionally intact through C5. Complement depletion by intravascularly administered cobra venom factor caused a parallel decrease in lavageable C5 from the rabbit's lungs. Whereas BALF C5 had specific activity comparable to serum C5, that of BALF C3 was lower than predicted. This was found to be due to the action of a substance that selectively blocked C3 activation. The inhibitor did not cause irreversible inactivation of C3, and it had no effect on C5 activity. It blocked the formation of EAC423 from EAC42 + C3, but not the lysis of preformed EAC423 + C5-9 or EAC423 rosetting with rabbit neutrophils. Hydrophobic chromatography of BALF separated the activity of the inhibitor from that of C3. Further chromatography showed that it had a net negative charge at physiologic pH, and molecular weight between 14 and 30 kilodaltons. The presence of an inhibitor of C3 activation in the airways would provide control of complement activation in an environment that is constantly exposed to bacteria, dust, and other potential inflammatory stimuli.\r"

We evaluated the pattern of female genital carriage during the menstrual cycle, and its relationship to HIV viremia. Seven menstruating seropositive women and one seronegative control had cervical secretions and venous blood samples cultured at weekly intervals during a single menstrual cycle. The virus was isolated from cervical secretions in four of seven women. No specific cycle pattern was seen, and positivity for HIV at one site (blood or cervical) did not correlate with positivity at another site. Blood cultures generally, but not always, became positive earlier than cultures from cervical specimens, suggesting higher titers of virus in blood. Thus, HIV secretion may be intermittent. These findings, together with earlier reports, suggest that seropositive women may transmit HIV at any time during the menstrual cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Quinolone antibiotics have been proposed as possible alternatives to vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We investigated the activities of amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and vancomycin by time-kill kinetic studies. Antibiotic concentrations of 0, 1.0, and 4.0 times the MIC were used against four strains of gentamicin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Staphylococci were plated onto ciprofloxacin-containing agar at all time points, in repeat time-kill kinetic studies. Macrobroth dilution MICs and MBCs were determined. Ciprofloxacin levels were measured by bioassay. Replica plating was performed from the original susceptible inoculum (MIC, 0.125 micrograms/ml) onto ciprofloxacin-supplemented agar. At 4.0 times the MIC, only with ciprofloxacin was there regrowth at 24 and 48 h. All four strains of staphylococci grew on agar supplemented with 1 microgram of ciprofloxacin per ml; three of four grew on agar supplemented with 2 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. MICs and MBCs for these resistant clones ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/ml. No degradation in activity or amount of ciprofloxacin could be detected in the bioassay. Replica-plated staphylococci grew on agar containing 1 microgram/ml but not higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin at 48 h. Amifloxacin and norfloxacin sustained bactericidal activity comparable to that of vancomycin. We conclude that heteroresistant subpopulations of gentamicin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus can emerge under antibiotic selection pressure. Such resistant clones may then mutate in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic to higher levels of ciprofloxacin resistance.\r"

In contrast, when streptomycin was present in concentrations above the MIC, no increase of streptomycin uptake was noted with the addition of oxacillin, and killing was no greater than what would have been expected with a simply additive effect. Similar studies in a strain of S. aureus selected for high-level streptomycin resistance also demonstrated increased streptomycin uptake in the presence of concentrations of oxacillin above the MIC; however, killing was no greater than that seen with oxacillin alone. These studies provide data which are potentially important in designing a rational approach to clinical use of combination antibiotic therapy.\r"

Extracorporeal membrane lung bypass rapidly corrected arterial blood gas values, and permitted the use of high levels of CPAP instead of the continuation of mechanical pulmonary ventilation at high peak airway pressures. Improvement in lung function was gradual, and predictable. Early institution of extracorporeal respiratory assist using a membrane artificial lung rapidly corrected arterial blood gas values and significantly improved on neonate survival.\r"

Twenty-five patients were studied for 4 days, while 5 remained in the study 3 days. Each of the 30 patients had each of the two methods of stabilization in place for at least 1 day. The oral endotracheal tube holder significantly (p less than 0.0001) decreased both internal and external movement of the tube. Although self-extubation did occur in two instances, it was evaluated as less likely to occur when the tube holder was used to secure the endotracheal tube. Skin breakdown was also observed less frequently with the tube holder. Overall, nursing staff had a higher level of acceptance of the tube holder as the method of choice for stabilization of an oral endotracheal tube. Patient perceptions of the system were not evaluated because of the degree of illness of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data suggest that eosinophils may cause lung injury. To determine if the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-halide system could mediate this injury, we added human EPO, H2O2 (or glucose and glucose oxidase as a continuous source of H2O2), and various halides to monolayers of 51Cr-labeled human A549 and rat type II pneumocytes. Cell lysis was measured as soluble 51Cr release. In initial experiments, EPO in solution did not induce lysis under these conditions. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, pneumocytes were preincubated with EPO for 15 minutes, washed to remove unbound enzyme, and then glucose, glucose oxidase, and the halides were added. EPO alone was not injurious, nor was the addition of glucose and glucose oxidase in the absence of EPO. In contrast, the combined addition of EPO, glucose, glucose oxidase, and chloride produced marked target-cell lysis. This effect was time and EPO dose dependent and was enhanced by the addition of iodide. Catalase and azide substantially inhibited the lysis produced by the EPO-H2O2-halide system, suggesting that EPO-catalyzed products of halide oxidation mediated this form of injury. Finally, the addition of eosinophil major basic protein at 10(-5) mol/L to EPO-coated pneumocytes incubated with glucose, glucose oxidase, and halides failed to enhance or inhibit lysis. We hypothesize that the EPO-H2O2-halide system may injure the lung in asthma and eosinophilic pulmonary syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "Both kallikrein and plasmin readily released 112,000 and 102,000 molecular weight derivatives from purified human high molecular weight (HMW)-kininogen. In each instance, these early digestion products were composed of disulfide-linked chains of 64,000 and 58,000 molecular weights. Under the experimental conditions used, kallikrein failed to release additional cleavage fragments from HMW-kininogen when it had been previously digested by plasmin, whereas HMW-kininogen pretreated with kallikrein was then cleaved by plasmin into several derivatives of decreasing molecular size. The profound molecular changes induced by plasmin were only accompanied by partial kinin release. Plasmin cleavage dissociated procoagulant activity from at least one antigenic site of HMW-kininogen light chain. Moreover, kinin activity could be released from a cleavage product of HMW-kininogen containing light but not heavy chain antigens, indicating that plasmin had cleaved this kininogen on the N-terminal side of the bradykinin region of the molecule. Cleavage of HMW-kininogen by kallikrein readily released bradykinin, whereas kinin release by plasmin was slower and the cleavage pattern different. It is, therefore, unlikely that plasmin is a major source of bradykinin release in plasma. A method of isolating HMW-kininogen from human plasma is described that provides a homogeneous single band of kininogen, with a recovery of approximately 44% with respect to that in plasma in a period of 5 days.\r"

A hospital-wide survey indicated that 13.2% of our patients were managed with physical restraints and that insufficient documentation occurred.
