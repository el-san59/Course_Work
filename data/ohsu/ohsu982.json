These included Denyes' (1980) Self-Care Agency, Kearney and Fleischer's (1979) Exercise of Self-Care Agency, and Hanson and Bickel's (1985) Perception of Self-Care Agency. The convenience sample consisted of 513 adult, nonhospitalized subjects who completed the three instruments. Common factor analysis and canonical correlation were used to identify latent traits and their relationships. The findings support the multidimensionality of Orem's (1985) concept of self-care agency. However, the use of one instrument does not adequately reflect this multidimensionality.\r"

The current study was designed to replicate initial work regarding GI symptoms and stool characteristics and to explore the relationships between GI symptoms, stool characteristics, ovarian hormone levels, and indicators of psychophysiological arousal. Fifty women (dysmenorrheic, N = 22; nondysmenorrheic, N = 28) maintained a daily dairy for recording stool characteristics, GI symptoms, and daily anxiety level. First morning void urine specimens for catecholamine assays and serum samples for ovarian hormone and cortisol determinations were obtained at menses, follicular, and luteal phases. Results showed menstrual cycle-related differences in stool characteristics and report of GI symptoms, with the greatest changes occurring at menses in the total sample. Dysmenorrheic women reported higher levels of all GI symptoms at menses as compared to nondysmenorrheic women. In addition, cycle-related differences in serum cortisol, urine catecholamines, and report of anxiety were also noted, particularly in dysmenorrheic women. However, looser stools and GI symptoms at menses were not correlated with absolute levels of ovarian hormones or indicators of psychophysiological arousal.\r"

Blood pressure was measured every 2 hours during the day and every 90 minutes during the night for one 24-hour cycle using a Dinamap monitor equipped with an automatic printer. Cosinor analyses revealed statistically significant circadian rhythms for systolic and diastolic blood pressures in 12 of the 40 subjects. The acrophases for systolic and diastolic pressures occurred between 1200-1800 hours. The mean systolic mesor was 108.50 while the mean diastolic mesor was 61.41. The mean amplitudes were 8.85 for systolic pressure and 7.44 for diastolic pressure. No statistically significant differences in circadian mesors and amplitudes between children of normotensive parents and children of hypertensive parents were found.\r"

Five hundred seven preterm neonates (26-35 weeks gestation) born alive from singleton pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) were selected. Each neonate was matched on gestational age, gender, ethnicity, and date of delivery to a neonate without PROM. A matched pairs analysis was done using risk ratios (RR) to measure strength of the association and risk differences (RD) to measure absolute effect. Analysis revealed that preterm births complicated by PROM were at significantly higher risk of neonatal sepsis (RR = 3.5) and infection (RR = 2.4). The RDs indicated that PROM exposure contributed an excess of 5 cases of sepsis per 100 infants (RD = 0.05). PROM was not significantly associated with neonatal mortality, but when PROM had existed over 48 hours there was a higher risk of sepsis and infection. Birth of a neonate over 1500 grams or 33 weeks gestation was the most important factor in reducing risk of infection in PROM deliveries.\r"

The sample consisted of 45 mothers of acutely ill, hospitalized children from 1-24 months of age. For each of the concepts, 16 events commonly associated with hospitalization of a child were proportionately ranked using magnitude estimation measurement technique. The psychometric properties of the instrument were estimated through reliability assessment and cross modality matching. Multiple regression analysis indicated that 97% of the dependent variable, coping effort, was explained by two of the three predictor variables--predictability of events and anxiety. Mothers who knew what events to expect experienced less anxiety and reported expending less effort to cope with the stressful events. Control was not a significant factor in predicting the mothers' coping effort.\r"

In the first phase of the study, a 44-item questionnaire was developed and tested through factor analysis primarily using a college population (Geden & Taylor, 1988). After the instrument was revised, a second study, reported here, was conducted with a more heterogeneous population. The age range of the respondents was broadened and the variability of health state and ethnicity was increased. Factor analysis with rotation was conducted on 589 completed inventories using the revised 40-item questionnaire. The 4-factor Promax solution accounted for 52% of the variance. Retention of factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 led to a 6-factor solution accounting for 58% of the variance. Significant positive correlations were found between total scores on the Self-As-Carer Inventory and ratings of health in general (r = .29, p = .0001), health at this moment (r = .25, p = .0001), and an estimate; of the amount of their own self-care provided (r = .36, p = .0001). No differences were found in total scores across health state, defined as respondents' reports of being sick-at-home (n = 130), hospitalized (n = 259), or well (n = 200).\r"

Four patterns of self-transcendence, congruent with the investigator's definition, were identified by the participants as being important to their sense of well-being: Generativity, Introjectivity, Temporal Integration, and Body-Transcendence. Results of Pearson correlation analysis and matrix analysis of data supported a relationship between self-transcendence and mental health found in previous research, thus demonstrating the importance of the expansion of self boundaries in older adults.\r"

Each time period was then rated multidimensionally (Duration, Discomfort, Interference, Threat to Life) to reflect the impact of the various conditions and the means by decade (Decade Impact) were computed. In general, after the first two decades, magnitude of ratings increased with age, indicating greater disease impact. Interrater reliability and internal consistency reliability of the scale were high. Evidence for construct validity included substantial differences between those with and without specific illness conditions, as well as correlations with hospitalization history and health self-ratings. In cluster analysis of patterns across decades, five distinct patterns emerged into which subjects were grouped.\r"

From evaluation of esophageal motility to the first depiction of gastric ulcers and carcinomas of the alimentary tube, gastrointestinal radiology became indispensable to physicians and surgeons. Improvements in fluoroscopic and radiographic equipment, the tilting table, the image intensifier with the television train, the introduction of selective visceral angiography with safer contrast media and, more recently, digital subtraction angiography, digital ultrasound (US), color Doppler US, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging--all of these advances have made imaging diagnosis more precise and specific. A new modality--localized tissue MR spectroscopy--should offer an insight into metabolism and suggest optimal modes of treatment and follow-up. The gastrointestinal radiologist of the future will have to be multimodality trained. A new generation of alimentary tract interventional radiologists will further the trend toward less invasive surgical therapy. No end of advances is in sight.\r"

The patency rates were not affected by the length of the occlusion and the long-term medication (platelet inhibition vs anticoagulation), but patients with a normal runoff had significantly better patency rates than those with reduced runoff (63% vs 52%, P less than .01). The study has shown that laser-assisted angioplasty is safe and at least as effective as conventional angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Results of percutaneous balloon cholangioplasty of 17 patients with 28 benign biliary strictures were compared with those of published radiologic and surgical series to determine whether stricture location was related to therapeutic success and whether a patient should undergo percutaneous or surgical therapy. Treatment was considered successful if there was no anatomic evidence of recurrent stricture or need for surgery (mean follow-up, 32 months). Treatment was successful in all nine (100%) intrahepatic (zone 1) strictures, 11 of 12 (92%) extrahepatic-extrapancreatic (zone 2) strictures, one of three (33%) intrapancreatic (zone 3) strictures, and three of four (75%) bilienteric anastomotic (zone 4) strictures. Restenosis occurred in five patients; cholangioplasty was ultimately successful in two of those patients after redilation and stent placement. On the basis of these results and those of published radiologic and surgical series, the authors believe that cholangioplasty is the treatment of choice for zone 1 strictures and is as effective as surgery for zone 2 and 4 strictures. Patients with zone 2 and 4 strictures with concomitant portal hypertension or a history of multiple previous biliary surgical procedures should be considered good candidates for cholangioplasty. Zone 3 strictures may be better treated surgically than percutaneously.\r"

Of the 45 patients with normal baseline serum amylase levels, 12 patients (24%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia without clinical symptoms and five patients (10%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia with clinical signs of pancreatitis. Five patients who presented with elevated baseline serum amylase levels demonstrated decreases into the normal range after placement of stents without initiation of bowel rest or liquid diet. The level of biliary obstruction proved insignificant, as did the nature of the obstructing disease, in determining which patients would experience hyperamylasemia or pancreatitis after PBD. It is concluded that the frequency of pancreatic insult from PBD may be more common than previously reported and that patient susceptibility is not dependent on the level of biliary obstruction or the nature of the disease.\r"

The abscess was cured (by clinical and radiographic criteria) in all 19 patients (100%), and surgery was avoided in 16 of the 19 patients (84%). Three patients underwent surgery for removal of organized tissue or decortication after the lung abscess was evacuated. Complications included a hemothorax that required a chest tube in one patient and three minor complications (a clogged catheter in two patients and transient elevation of intracerebral pressure in one patient). The hemothorax occurred in one of two patients in whom the catheter traversed normal lung. The percutaneous drainage catheters traversed juxtaposed abnormal pleura on route to the abscess in 17 of the patients. CT-guided drainage of lung abscess is an effective method to treat lung abscesses that are refractory to conventional therapy; the procedure should obviate major operation in most patients. A catheter route through abscess-pleural syndesis is preferable, and CT is useful for planning this route.\r"

Segmented turboFLASH uses a gradient-echo sequence designed for short imaging times in combination with a segmented data acquisition method. Presaturation pulses were applied to eliminate the blood pool signal; the signal-to-noise ratio was assessed with a phantom. Standard hardware and image reconstruction methods were used. The breath-hold images consistently showed reduced ghosting and blurring from respiration. Because a very short echo time was used, segmented turboFLASH was relatively insensitive to dephasing caused by local field disturbances or flow. The authors conclude that, by reducing imaging times and eliminating respiratory artifact, segmented turboFLASH can be useful for performing cine studies of the heart and great vessels.\r"

A total of 337,647 cases were analyzed. The reliability of pretesting with an intravenous injection of a small amount of CM as a means of predicting severe or fatal reactions was also evaluated. The predictive values of the pretest were 1.2% for ionic and 0.0% for nonionic CM, and the sensitivity values were 3.7% and 0.0%, respectively. Such low values render this test meaningless for predicting which patients are at risk of a severe adverse reaction. A comparison of the incidence of severe adverse reactions between the nonpretested and pretested patients, as well as between the nonpretested and pretested patients with negative results, disclosed no statistically significant differences. Also, no beneficial effects of premedication in patients with a positive pretest were proved. The authors therefore conclude that pretesting with an intravenous injection of a small amount of CM is not useful in predicting severe reactions to ionic or nonionic CM.\r"

Recognizing the significance of these antenatal sonographic findings is important because in utero infections can have devastating effects on the developing fetus. An infectious viral agent was isolated in laboratory tests at birth in 11 patients, and the effects of a viral agent were proved clinically in eight. Antenatal sonography demonstrated abnormalities in 18 fetuses: Multiple organ systems were affected in 47%; intracranial abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, and parenchymal calcifications occurred in 42%, 37%, and 32%, respectively; large placentas were seen in 32%; and the volume of amniotic fluid was decreased in 37% and increased in 37%. Sixty-three percent of fetuses were either aborted or died at birth; the 37% that lived were all developmentally impaired. On the basis of these sonographic, laboratory, and clinical findings, the authors conclude that when multiple organ system abnormalities are found at antenatal ultrasound, the presence of an in utero infection should be considered. The parents should be informed that there is a poor prognosis for any fetus demonstrating such abnormalities.\r"

To determine criteria for predicting impending first-trimester loss when a normal fetal heart rate is identified sonographically, the authors studied 16 consecutively examined patients with pregnancies of 5.5-9 weeks gestation, a small sac size, and fetuses with normal cardiac activity. Mean sac size (MSS) was determined and a small sac was diagnosed when the difference between the MSS and crown-rump length (MSS--CR) was less than 5 mm. Fifty-two consecutively examined patients with pregnancies of 5.5-9 weeks gestation, normal sac size, and fetuses with normal heart rate formed the control group. An MSS--CR of 5 mm or greater was considered normal. Fifteen of the 16 patients (94%) with first-trimester small sacs had spontaneous abortions despite normal sonographic cardiac activity. Four of the 52 control patients (8%) with normal sac sizes had spontaneous abortions. The authors' data show that, despite the presence of fetal cardiac activity at the time of sonography, the usual reassurance provided to patients should be guarded when the sac size is small.\r"

Patients with abnormal renal function, dysplastic kidneys, or a family history of polycystic kidney disease were excluded from the study. The authors' review of the sonograms revealed 37 simple cysts in 35 patients (0.22%); the cysts were evenly distributed by age and sex and measured from 0.3 to 7.0 cm in maximum diameter. Sixteen cysts (43%) were in the upper pole of the right kidney. Follow-up sonographic studies of 23 cysts in 22 patients for up to 5 years showed no change in size in 17 cysts (74%). The largest cyst was drained percutaneously; all other cysts were managed conservatively. No patient showed deterioration of renal function. Therefore, the authors concluded that in a pediatric patient demonstrating normal renal function, no further intervention is necessary when a simple renal cyst is identified at sonography.\r"

Shock waves are created by means of three different types of shock wave generators: spark-gap, electromagnetic, and piezoelectric. The authors describe and compare these three types of shock wave generators with regard to equipment selection. Regardless of how shock waves are generated, they share common interactions with tissue. These interactions are reviewed along with the proposed mechanisms of stone fragmentation.\r"

In 21 of the patients, parenchymal abnormalities were found. Major parenchymal features seen at CT included thickened intralobular and interlobular lines, subpleural curvilinear lines, pleural-based nodular irregularities, hazy patches of increased attenuation, small cystic spaces, and small areas of low attenuation. At paired serial CT, subpleural isolated dots or branching structures connected with the most peripheral branch of the pulmonary artery started to appear in lower subpleural zones and then became confluent to create pleural-based nodular irregularities. CT-pathologic correlation led to the conclusion that the confluence of subpleural peribronchiolar fibrosis creates subpleural fibrosis.\r"

Pathologic examination confirmed three B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, one round-cell sarcoma, one mesothelioma, and one adenocarcinoma. Retrospective findings on plain chest radiographs suggested the occurrence of malignancy: increased radiopacity in the thoracic cavity, soft-tissue bulgings and/or unsharpness of fat planes in the chest walls, destruction of bone near the empyema, and extensive medial deviation of the calcified pleurae. Computed tomography delineated masses with soft-tissue attenuation more clearly than radiography in all cases. Magnetic resonance images of three cases were informative because empyema cavities were surrounded by low-intensity rims, and two of them showed a signal intensity different from that of necrotic tumors. Scintigraphy revealed increased uptake of gallium in all cases. Ultrasonography was useful for biopsy guidance. Every radiologist should know this entity in observation of chest radiographs obtained in patients with chronic empyema, and further radiologic assessment and aggressive biopsy are recommended if malignancy is suspected.\r"

Therefore, the authors selected 41 patients, whose results at CT examinations demonstrated a variety of pathologic conditions of the paranasal sinuses, to undergo MR imaging both with and without the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement. In 22 of 35 cases of neoplasms and mucoceles occurring separately, the lesions were correctly differentiated by established MR signal criteria alone. However, 32 of these 35 cases were accurately differentiated when gadolinium-enhanced MR images were obtained. Six cases demonstrated co-existing neoplasm and mucocele: Gadolinium-enhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of five of these lesions, while unenhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of three. On the basis of these results, the authors conclude that the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement at MR imaging is useful for differentiating mucoceles from neoplasms in the sinonasal tract.\r"

  ".W": "The sonographic criteria for diagnosis of retinal detachment and vitreous membranes are well established, and in most cases a diagnosis can be made. However, in difficult cases, differentiation between the two may be difficult. In this study the use of high-resolution color flow Doppler was evaluated for differentiating between retinal detachments and vitreous membranes. Sonographic evaluation, including color flow Doppler, was performed in 25 symptomatic eyes. Seven eyes had areas of retinal detachment, all of which had detectable blood flow within at least a portion of the detached retina. Fifteen eyes had vitreous hemorrhages or membranes in which no flow was detected. Two diabetic patients with vitreous membranes and no retinal detachment did have flow detectable within the neovascular membranes. Another patient, who had a complete choroid detachment after surgery, demonstrated good flow within the area of detachment. It is concluded that in difficult cases high-resolution color flow Doppler can enable differentiation of an area of retinal detachment from a vitreous membrane in a patient without diabetes.\r"

Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of cerebral ischemia/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images. The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank brain infarction. This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up MR examinations. Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear.\r"

Seven to 10 images were obtained every 20-30 seconds with use of the spin-echo technique after rapid injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The earliest contrast material enhancement of normal structures was seen in the infundibulum and posterior lobe of the pituitary gland at 20 seconds, followed by gradual contrast material enhancement of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland from the junction of the infundibulum to the peripheral portion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland within 80 seconds after gadopentetate dimeglumine injection. The peak enhancement of pituitary adenomas occurred at 60-200 seconds, usually after the most marked enhancement of the normal pituitary gland. Microadenomas are best visualized at earlier phases of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced dynamic imaging, with signal intensity lower than that seen on images of normal pituitary glands.\r"

Two readers, without the aid of any clinical or demographic information, classified each of the 260 studies as MS or not MS. The readers classified the studies again after being supplied with the subjects' ages and sex. True-negative and true-positive diagnoses of MS were tabulated. The specificity of the MR diagnosis of MS (true-negative results in proportion to all non-MS studies) was 95%-99% with all the control groups included. There is a small risk of misinterpreting incidental periventricular white matter foci as plaques of MS in MR studies.\r"

Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects. Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques. MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations. There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography. In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging.\r"

The initial clinical response to surgery was graded excellent, good, fair, or poor; 5-year follow-up was available in 55% of cases. The magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in these patients were also blindly reviewed for the magnitude of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow void (graded on the basis of extent rather than degree of signal loss) in the cerebral aqueduct. A significant (P less than .003) correlation existed between good or excellent response to surgery and an increased CSF flow void. The presence of associated deep white matter infarction on MR images did not correlate with a poor response to surgery. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that patients who fulfill the clinical criteria of NPH and have an increased CSF flow void undergo creation of a shunt.\r"

This pulse sequence yielded 16 quantitative flow-encoded images per cardiac cycle (peripheral gating). Flow encoding depicted craniocaudal flow as high signal intensity and caudo-cranial flow as low signal intensity. Sagittal and axial images of the head, cervical spine, and lumbar spine were obtained, and strategic sites were analyzed for quantitative CSF flow. The onset of CSF systole in the subarachnoid space was synchronous with the onset of systole in the carotid artery. CSF systole and diastole at the foramen of Monro and aqueduct were essentially simultaneous. The systolic and diastolic components were different in the subarachnoid space, where systole occupied approximately 40% and diastole 60% of the cardiac cycle, compared with the ventricular system, where they were equal. This difference results in systole in the intracranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces preceding that in the ventricular system; the same is true for diastole. The fourth ventricle and cisterna magna serve as mixing chambers. The high-velocity flow in the cervical spine and essentially no flow in the distal lumbar sac indicate that a portion of the capacitance necessary in this essentially closed system resides in the distal spinal canal.\r"

Four patients underwent ileoanal anastomosis after total colectomy for various conditions; five patients underwent rectosigmoid end-to-end anastomosis after resection of a tumor or as treatment for diverticulitis. Maximal stricture dilatation was attained in 20 instances with a single 15-30-mm balloon. In five procedures, two balloons (20 or 15 mm) were inflated simultaneously (\"kissing balloons\" technique) to dilate the strictures. In five patients, only one dilation procedure was required for effective treatment of the strictures, with no clinical evidence of strictures after follow-up of 1.5-56 months (mean, 29.5 months). In the other four patients, multiple procedures were performed: nine in one patient, five in one patient, and three in two patients. In these patients, no recurrent symptoms developed during follow-up of 1.25-18 months (mean, 8.1 months) after the last dilation. Complicating leaks, infection, or hemorrhage did not occur after any of the procedures. Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of rectal strictures.\r"

The charts of these patients were then reviewed, and correlations between the CT grade and clinical outcome were determined with each grading system. Forty patients underwent successful nonsurgical treatment; three of these patients (8%) underwent delayed celiotomy for splenic rupture after failure of nonsurgical treatment. Two of these three had grades that indicated nonsurgical treatment was viable. In each of these three patients, splenectomy was necessary. In the 16 patients who underwent surgery, eight cases (50%) of CT grading errors were documented with surgery. In four cases, the extent of the injury was underscored with CT, and in another four cases the injury was overscored. It is still not clear whether the severity of splenic injury as defined with CT correlates with clinical outcome.\r"

The portal blood supply was evaluated with computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography (CTAP); the arterial blood supply was evaluated with hepatic angiography, CT angiography, CT following intraarterial injection of iodized oil, or ultrasound following intraarterial injection of carbon dioxide microbubbles. A total of 84 surgically confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (less than or equal to 3 cm) and 25 areas of adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) were included in the study. At CTAP, a portal blood supply was seen in 96% of cases of AH and only 6% of HCCs (chi 2, P less than .005). In contrast, an arterial supply greater than that of the surrounding liver was verified in 94% of the HCCs and only 4% of the cases of AH (chi 2, P less than .005). The blood supply of areas of AH with atypical hepatocytes and the blood supply of well-differentiated HCCs (Edmondson grade 1) tended to be intermediate between that of AH without atypia and that of HCC that was Edmondson and Steiner grade 2 or greater. Evaluation of the blood supply of the nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis is considered to be useful in the differential diagnosis and treatment of early-stage HCC.\r"

After baseline noncontrast CT was performed, DSBCT was performed with a 180-mL intravenous bolus administered at 2 mL/sec. Scanning was started 25 seconds after the bolus was initiated, by using a 3-second scan time and rapid cephalocaudal table incrementation, yielding contiguous 8-mm-thick sections at a rate of nine sections per minute. On postcontrast images, peak enhancement was 115% for iopamidol and 117% for iohexol, both of which were superior to iothalamate meglumine at 95% (P less than .05). After peaking, enhancement then decreased for all three contrast agents, although the decline was more precipitous for iothalamate meglumine. Enhancement on the more caudal sections with both iopamidol and iohexol was superior to that with iothalamate meglumine (P less than .05). The data suggest that the enhancement characteristics for the two nonionic agents may be more optimal for detection of focal hepatic lesions than the ionic agent.\r"

Mostly short-lived gastrointestinal side effects were noted in 32% of patients. Gadopentetate dimeglumine provided uniform hyperintense marking of the bowel and contrast enhancement in the region of interest in 81% of patients. Among 78 patients with images obtained both before and after administration of contrast material, post-contrast improvement of lesion delineation was found in 62%.

One hundred forty-one symptomatic patients with one to three gallstones 5-30 mm in diameter were randomized to treatment. One week before ESWL, patients were given either UDCA or placebo. This treatment was continued for 6 months. All patients underwent follow-up at predetermined intervals. According to the protocol, re-treatment for fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter could be performed only at 6 weeks; 26 (18%) of the 141 patients were retreated. At 6 months, the stone-free rates for single stones were as follows: patients with noncalcified stones receiving UDCA, 29%; patients with noncalcified stones receiving placebo, 24%; and patients with partially calcified stones receiving either UDCA or placebo, 6%. No significant difference was noted between the UDCA and placebo groups. At 6 months, the stone-free rates in patients with single, noncalcified stones 20 mm or less in diameter were 40% (UDCA) and 32% (placebo), which is superior to rates for those with solitary, noncalcified gallstones 21-30 mm in diameter and those with two or three stones.\r"

The waveform of HVs was arbitrarily classified into three patterns: HV0, a normal waveform; HV1, lower oscillations without the reversed phase; and HV2, completely flat waveform. The resistivity index of the superior mesenteric artery, reflecting the peripheral splanchnic impedance and the hyperdynamic circulation, was also measured in a subgroup of 45 cirrhotic patients. The waveform of HVs in all healthy subjects corresponded to the HV0 pattern. Among cirrhotic patients, HV0 was found in 30 (50%), HV1 in 19 (31.7%), and HV2 in 11 (81.3%). The severity of functional impairment was greatest in the HV2 group and least in the HV0 group. This was significantly correlated with the decrease of the resistivity index in the superior mesenteric artery in the subgroup of 45 patients. Changes in the normal HV waveform could be considered a useful adjunctive tool for the noninvasive evaluation of liver disease. The pathophysiology of these changes in HV blood flow is still unclear. The significant correlation with the severity of the disease and with the decrease of splanchnic resistances indicates that these changes in the HV waveform occur in the presence of marked rearrangements of liver tissue and of hyperdynamic systemic circulation.\r"

High-resolution T2-weighted images of unenhanced lymph nodes demonstrated medullary sinus as regions of low signal intensity and follicles as high-intensity structures. After a single intravenous administration of USPIO (160 mumol/kg), both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images showed areas of focal signal intensity loss in medullary sinuses corresponding to the distribution of uptake by macrophages. Lymph follicles appeared unchanged in signal intensity, as they are largely devoid of macrophages. This model of microscopic MR imaging should provide the basis for (a) understanding differences between patterns of contrast-enhanced normal lymph nodes and those of diseased ones and (b) guiding the development of targeting strategies for novel pharmaceuticals at the cellular level.\r"

All patients had undergone imaging with a 1.5-T imager with T1- and T2-weighted sequences in both axial and sagittal planes before undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. At pathologic examination, only the palpable tumor was present in 30 of the 53 patients (57%), and 33 unsuspected tumors were present in an area distinct from the palpable tumor in 23 of the patients (43%). MR imaging successfully depicted 51 palpable tumors for a sensitivity of 96% and 19 of the 33 unsuspected tumors for a sensitivity of 58%. The sensitivity of MR imaging in the detection of nonpalpable, posteriorly located tumors was greater than for those located anteriorly (85% vs 15%). MR imaging was false-positive for nonpalpable tumor in 17 of 30 patients for a specificity of 43%. On the basis of these data, MR imaging has greater sensitivity in the depiction of posteriorly located cancer and is limited by a high false-positive rate in the depiction of nonpalpable tumors.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether radiologists can objectively define a high-risk group for prostate cancer, the researchers measured gland volume and compared it with results of a screening blood test, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay. A total of 768 men, aged 55-71 years, were self-referred to two prostate cancer screening programs using transrectal ultrasound (US) and digital rectal examination. In patients with no evidence of cancer, statistically significant increases in mean PSA values were noted with increasing gland volume ranges (P less than .05). PSA values in patients with cancer were more likely to exceed the volume-adjusted 95th percentile (mean + [1.65.standard deviation]) than those in patients with negative biopsy results (P less than .005). Patients with PSA values above the volume-adjusted 95th percentile have an estimated risk for prostate cancer up to nine times that of the general screening population. The researchers conclude that knowledge of transrectal US gland volume and prostate-specific antigen assay type are important objective variables for future prostate cancer screening programs. The volume-adjusted 95th percentiles presented may help guide cost-effective management of current early detection efforts.\r"

All three patients with ACL laxity failed to demonstrate a well-defined autograft, for an overall correlation between MR imaging and clinical examination results of 92%. Of the 12 patients who underwent second-look arthroscopy, 100% correlation was present between MR imaging and arthroscopic results. As in the nonreconstructed knee, buckling of the posterior cruciate ligament was suggestive of ACL laxity. MR imaging also documented optimum placement of bone tunnels in the femur and tibia. MR imaging has proved to be an excellent noninvasive imaging modality for evaluating ACL reconstruction, while also providing ancillary information about the postoperative knee.\r"

The knees then were sectioned at 4-mm intervals. Both the real and the imaged cartilage thicknesses were measured. Areas of cartilage thinning and focal defects seen in the cadaveric sections were most accurately matched, in both the presence and the absence of intraarticular saline solution simulating joint fluid, by images obtained with the T1-weighted HFS sequences. Accurate imaging of hyaline cartilage thickness with differentiation of cartilage from fluid was possible routinely. Standard and HFS spin-echo images obtained after intraarticular injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine depicted cartilage less accurately than HFS sequences either with or without saline injection. MR imaging with T1-weighted HFS sequences provided superior visualization of cartilage, enabling accurate measurements of cartilage thickness and differentiation of cartilage from saline solution simulating joint fluid.\r"

The weight-determination procedure is based on the correlation between bullet cross-sectional area, as derived from three orthogonal radiographs, and bullet weight, as determined from a data base of the properties of 48 bullets removed from humans. Different equations were developed for bullets weighing 5.8 g or less, or more than 5.8 g. For relatively undeformed bullets an additional method calculated caliber directly from the diameter of the bullet body on radiographs. Both methods enabled correct prediction of the weight and caliber of the bullets; if one method could not be used, results of the other were reliable. Testimony based on these results has been accepted in a local police case and may meet requirements for testimony in U.S. court cases involving gunshots.\r"

With a median follow-up of 13 months, 135 eyes were evaluable. Most pterygia (127 of 135) were treated with a single postoperative application of Sr-90 that delivered 3,000 cGy of beta radiation in one fraction. The actuarial freedom from relapse was 87%; all recurrences occurred within the first 18 months, and 46% of these within the first 3 months. Of the 13 recurrences, 10 have been re-treated with surgery and a second course of beta irradiation with excellent results. All eight eyes for which follow-up was available had no evidence of disease. The ultimate control rate was 96.3% for the series. Correlation of various treatment parameters, including age, bilaterality, prior recurrence, and interval from surgery to irradiation, was performed, and no statistically significant difference was seen. No serious complications have developed. Transient conjunctivitis and photophobia were almost universally seen, with five cases lasting beyond 5 months. The authors conclude that a single application of Sr-90 after surgery is effective and safe in managing pterygia.\r"

All children had acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae by the age of 3 months. The most frequently occurring serotypes of S. pneumoniae were 6, 19, and 23. Children more frequently carried invasive pneumococci during an episode of ALRI than when they were healthy. Also, children more frequently carried serotypable strains of H. influenzae during the 2 weeks preceding an episode of ALRI than when they were healthy.

Among 72 isolates from Papua New Guinea, 72% were type b, 14% were other encapsulated serotypes, and 14% were nontypable. The respective frequencies among 43 isolates from the Philippines were 56%, 7%, and 37%. The type b isolates could be subdivided into at least eight outer membrane subtypes, most of which have been described previously. In contrast, OMP profiles of the nontypable H. influenzae isolates from children in both countries were highly heterogeneous. These results differ markedly from those previously found for isolates from children with acute respiratory tract infections in Pakistan, for which encapsulated H. influenzae strains other than serotype b were not observed; 95% of type b isolates were of a single OMP subtype; and nontypable isolates showed evidence of clonal restriction. Candidate vaccines for use in developing countries as protection against disease caused by H. influenzae will need to include both capsular and noncapsular antigens and investigators must take into consideration regional differences among strains.\r"

This research was conducted prospectively on 250 families with 470 children less than 5 years of age who were contacted every 8 days during the 3-year study. The yearly incidence of respiratory tract infections decreased from 5.2 to 3.4 during the study; less than 5% of these infections involved the lower respiratory tract. The incidence was inversely related to age, and the illnesses were generally mild and brief in length. Fifteen children died during the study period. The precise causes of death are unknown, but respiratory infections possibly played a role in most cases. This study emphasizes the importance of determining the risk factors responsible for unusually severe morbidity and high mortality in children with ARI in developing countries.\r"

These risk ratios remained significant when adjusted for age, crowding, and parental smoking. Malnourished children with severe ALRI also had a mortality risk two to three times higher than that of healthy children. This risk remained significant even when adjusted for significant predictors of mortality, including clinical complications, concurrent measles, severe infections, and female gender; and for clinical factors, including extent of pneumonic infiltrates, dehydration, and hepatic enlargement. These findings underscore the importance of nutritional intervention in the control of morbidity and mortality among patients with ARI.\r"

Heart failure (8.5%), hypovolemia (4.2%), and nosocomial infection (12.6%) were also seen in children with fatal acute lower respiratory tract infection. Extensive consolidation, squamous metaplasia, and hyaline membranes were present in the lungs of these children. Patients with severe disease must receive, in addition to antibiotics for acute episodes, individualized intensive respiratory and supportive care. Since these types of care are not available in poor communities, vaccination against measles and vitamin A supplementation for malnourished children may ameliorate the conditions that appear to predispose these children to severe or fatal disease.\r"

Incidence rates from six of the community-based studies ranged from 12.7 to 16.8 new episodes of ARI per 100 child-weeks at risk, and rates of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 new episodes per 100 child-weeks at risk. Children spend from 21.7% to 40.1% of observed weeks with ARI and from 1% to 14.4% of observed weeks with LRI. The incidence rates for ARI are highest in younger children. Viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus, are isolated more frequently than bacteria from children with episodes of LRI. Risk factors exhibited different patterns of association with ARI in different studies. Interventions could have great impact on high-risk levels common in the study populations. These studies provide interesting and useful data on the epidemiologic dynamics of ARI.\r"

Virologic studies were performed on the NPA by means of indirect immunofluorescence and isolation of virus in cell culture. Bacteriologic studies primarily were done by means of culture of blood or pleural fluid (when available); Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, however, were searched for by the use of immunofluorescence and complement-fixation testing, respectively, in paired sera. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most commonly isolated virus, followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by B. pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Overall, the patient fatality rate was 3.8% among inpatients with pneumonia or bronchiolitis.\r"

Crowding in the home was found to be significantly associated with an increased incidence of LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus was the viral agent most frequently isolated from cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with LRI. Staphylococcus aureus was the bacterial agent most frequently isolated from the blood of patients with LRI.\r"

Data were obtained for a total of 674 children, who were visited twice weekly for detection of signs and symptoms of ARI. During the first year of the study, throat-swab specimens were obtained for bacterial culture from both ill and healthy children and a nasal wash was performed on mildly ill children for detection of virus. During both years of the study, nasopharyngeal aspiration for identification of virus was performed for children with more severe infection. The overall incidence of ARI was 11.2 episodes per child-year. The highest (14.9) and lowest (8.8) rates per child-year occurred in age groups 6-11 months and 48-59 months, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the prevalent pathogenic agents identified. Factors associated with higher risk of ARI were low family income, working mothers, mothers with allergies, chronic malnutrition, and crowding in the home.\r"

The incidence of ARI was 5.8 episodes per child-year during the first 12 months of life and decreased with increasing age of the index children; the rate was highest in children 1-5 months old. Children observed from birth were ill during 21% of the visits. According to the definitions of the study, the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was 11.6% higher than the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections. The rates of ARI were higher during the colder months. Most risk factors for ARI were only marginally statistically significant.\r"

In this survey, 1,000 nasopharyngeal aspirate and 13 lung tissue samples were tested in four cell lines (HEp-2, MRC-5, MDCK, and LLC-MK2) and by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), while 242 paired sera were studied by complement fixation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected agent (n = 183), followed by adenovirus (n = 28), parainfluenza (n = 5) and 3 (n = 16) viruses, and influenza A (n = 10) and B (n = 4) viruses. The sensitivity and specificity of IIF identification vs. isolation in cell culture were high for RSV (91.5% and 94.9%, respectively). However, IIF proved poorly sensitive for detection of adenovirus (sensitivity, 23.8%; specificity, 100%). The complement-fixation test proved the least effective, with a sensitivity of only 41.5%. Therefore, on the basis of our experience, it appears that the yield for positive diagnosis of virus is increased if both isolation in multiple cell lines and identification by means of IIF are used. Our survey provides for the first time reliable data on the viral etiology of ALRI in Argentina, as determined by three different methods.\r"

Virus was detected in 33.3%, 32.8%, 21.2%, and 20% of the cases of tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup, respectively. Among the viruses detected, 78% were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (91% of infections with this virus occurred in children less than 2 years old) and 14.4% were influenza virus types A and B. Of the RSV infections, 61% occurred in infants less than 1 year old. The case-fatality rate was 6.8% overall and was 4.8% in virus-associated cases. No consistent pattern of seasonal occurrence of viral infections was discerned. RSV was detected throughout the year, with increased prevalence from January to April.\r"

Three methods for detection of viral infection are compared: direct examination of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract with the use of fluorescent antibody staining, isolation of virus, and measurement of antibody in acute- and convalescent-phase sera. Viral infections were found in 44.7% of the study population. Diagnosis by the examination of epithelial cells with the fluorescent antibody staining procedure was found to have several deficiencies; however, this technique was the most sensitive for diagnosis of infection due to respiratory syncytial virus. Isolation of virus was the best method for identification of adenoviruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and influenza B virus. Problems associated with serodiagnosis included failure to obtain specimens of convalescent-phase blood in 24.5% of cases and insensitivity of serodiagnosis for young children except for the identification of antibody to influenza A virus. The combination of all three tests yielded the best rate of detection of virus.\r"

Many population biologists argue that, except for altruism to close relatives, human behavior that appears to be altruistic amounts to reciprocal altruism, behavior undertaken with an expectation of reciprocation, hence incurring no net cost to fitness. Herein is proposed a simple and robust mechanism, based on human docility and bounded rationality that can account for the evolutionary success of genuinely altruistic behavior. Because docility-receptivity to social influence-contributes greatly to fitness in the human species, it will be positively selected. As a consequence, society can impose a \"tax\" on the gross benefits gained by individuals from docility by inducing docile individuals to engage in altruistic behaviors. Limits on rationality in the face of environmental complexity prevent the individual from avoiding this \"tax.\" An upper bound is imposed on altruism by the condition that there must remain a net fitness advantage for docile behavior after the cost to the individual of altruism has been deducted.\r"

The first is whether abuse per se has deleterious effects. In earlier studies, in which samples were nonrepresentative and family ecological factors (such as poverty, marital violence, and family instability) and child biological variables (such as early health problems and temperament) were ignored, findings have been ambiguous. Results from a prospective study of a representative sample of 309 children indicated that physical abuse is indeed a risk factor for later aggressive behavior even when the other ecological and biological factors are known. The second question concerns the processes by which antisocial development occurs in abused children. Abused children tended to acquire deviant patterns of processing social information, and these may mediate the development of aggressive behavior.\r"

Mapping the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer may also allow the identification of early lesions that are critical for the development of breast cancer in the general population. Chromosome 17q21 appears to be the locale of a gene for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer in families with early-onset disease. Genetic analysis yields a lod score (logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage) of 5.98 for linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to D17S74 in early-onset families and negative lod scores in families with late-onset disease. Likelihood ratios in favor of linkage heterogeneity among families ranged between 2000:1 and greater than 10(6):1 on the basis of multipoint analysis of four loci in the region.\r"

The cDNA's of the bovine, human, and rat genes have been isolated and encode extraordinarily conserved proteins unrelated to known growth or neurotrophic factors, although identity of nearly 50 percent has been found with the predicted sequence of a retinoic acid induced transcript in differentiating mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. Lysates of COS-7 cells transiently expressing this protein were mitogenic for NRK cells and initiated neurite outgrowth from mixed cultures of embryonic rat brain cells. RNA transcripts encoding this protein were widely distributed in tissues and were developmentally regulated. This protein, previously designated as heparin binding growth factor (HBGF)-8, is now renamed pleiotrophin (PTN) to reflect its diverse activities. PTN may be the first member of a family of developmentally regulated cytokines.\r"

Bovine papillomavirus DNA synthesis requires the products of the viral E1 gene and the transcriptional activator protein encoded by the E2 gene. Experimental data showed that the 68-kilodalton (kD) E1 protein formed a complex with the 48-kD E2 transcription factor. This complex bound specifically to the viral origin of replication, which contains multiple binding sites for E2. Repressor proteins encoded by the E2 open reading frame failed to complex with E1 suggesting that the 162-amino acid region of E2 that participates in transactivation contained critical determinants for interaction with E1. The physical association between a replication protein and a transcription factor suggests that transcriptional activator proteins may function in targeting replication initiator proteins to their respective origins of replication.\r"

The binding affinity of hGH for the extracellular binding domain of the hPRL receptor (hPRLbp) was increased about 8000-fold by addition of 50 micromolar ZnCl2. Zinc was not required for binding of hGH to the hGH binding protein (hGHbp) or for binding of hPRL to the hPRLbp. Other divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) at physiological concentrations did not support such strong binding. Scatchard analysis indicated a stoichiometry of one Zn2+ per hGH.hPRLbp complex. Mutational analysis showed that a cluster of three residues (His18, His21, and Glu174) in hGH and His188 from the hPRLbp (conserved in all PRL receptors but not GH receptors) are probable Zn2+ ligands. This polypeptide hormone.receptor \"zinc sandwich\" provides a molecular mechanism to explain why nonprimate GHs are not lactogenic and offers a molecular link between zinc deficiency and its association with altered functions of hGH.\r"

Proliferative breast disease (PBD) is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer and appears to be a precursor lesion. PBD and breast cancer were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with breast cancer and in 31 control women. Physical examination, screening mammography, and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed. Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35% of clinically normal female first degree relatives of breast cancer cases and in 13% of controls. Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and breast cancer in these kindreds. This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of breast cancer, including unilateral and postmenopausal breast cancer.\r"

Two closely related genes in this region, HAM1 and HAM2, were cloned and had sequence similarities to a superfamily of genes involved in the ATP-dependent transport of a variety of substrates across cell membranes. Thus, these MHC-linked transport protein genes may be involved in transporting antigen, or peptide fragments thereof, from the cytoplasm into a membrane-bounded compartment containing newly synthesized MHC molecules.\r"

Treatment with 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br cAMP), a stimulator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase A (PKA)], mimicked progesterone-dependent, receptor-mediated transcription in the absence of progesterone. Inhibition of PKA blocked hormone action. Treatment with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, stimulated transcription in a manner similar to that of progesterone. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of the PR or other proteins in the transcription complex can modulate PR-mediated transcription in vivo.\r"

The effects of oncogenic Harvey ras p21 protein (v-Ras) occurred quickly and were sustained, whereas the effects of proto-oncogenic ras protein (c-Ras) were transient. This relative potency is consistent with the activities of these oncoproteins in stimulating cell proliferation. Thus, this calcium channel may be a target for Ras action.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from nine of ten patients showed that crossovers occurred within 99% homologous, 594-base pair (bp) segments that flanked GH1. A DNA sample from one patient indicated that the crossover occurred within 454-bp segments that flanked GH1 and contained 274-bp repeats that are 98% homologous. Although Alu repeats, which are frequent sites of recombination, are adjacent to GH1, they were not involved in any of the recombination events studied. These results suggest that length and degree of DNA sequence homology are important in defining recombination sites that resulted in GH1 deletions.\r"

The c-Myc basic region was tested for its ability to bind DNA by attaching it to the HLH dimerization interface of the E12 enhancer binding factor. Dimers of the chimeric protein, termed E6, specifically bound an E box element (GGCCACGTGACC) recognized by other HLH proteins in a manner dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc basic motif. Methylation of the core CpG in the E box recognition site specifically inhibited binding by E6, but not by two other HLH proteins.

The Lyn protein and its kinase activity could be coimmunoprecipitated with IgM from detergent lysates.

When a chromosomal or plasmid-borne copy of ampD was present, the amount of pentapeptide-containing muropeptides in the cell wall increased upon addition of the cell wall constituent diaminopimelic acid to the growth medium. These results suggest that beta-lactamase induction and modulation of the composition of the cell wall share elements of a regulatory circuit that involves AmpD. Escherichia coli requires AmpD to respond to extracellular signaling amino acids, such as diaminopimelic acid, and this signal transduction system may regulate peptidoglycan composition in response to cell wall turnover products.\r"

During the normal course of adipogenesis, C/EBP expression is restricted to a terminal phase wherein proliferative growth is arrested, and specialized cell phenotype is first manifested. A conditional form of C/EBP was developed, making it feasible to test its capacity to regulate the differentiation of cultured adipocytes. Premature expression of C/EBP in adipoblasts caused a direct cessation of mitotic growth. Moreover, when abetted by the effects of three adipogenic hormones, C/EBP promoted terminal cell differentiation. Since C/EBP is expressed in a variety of tissues, it may have a fundamental role in regulating the balance between cell growth and differentiation in higher animals.\r"

To determine whether one song nucleus, the caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum (HVc), acts in conspecific song perception, courtship responses of female canaries to canary and white-crowned sparrow songs were compared before and after HVc lesions. Bilateral lesions of a portion of the HVc resulted in copulation solicitations to heterospecific song as well as conspecific song. Control females continued to respond only to conspecific song. This suggests that the HVc is critical for conspecific song perception in females. Because female canaries do not normally sing, neurons in female HVc must develop response selectivity by a mechanism different from that proposed for male birds in the motor theory of song perception.\r"

Paradoxically, cyclophosphamide, which is also immunosuppressive, was very effective in preventing the appearance and progression of the disease, in restoring a normal T cell function, and in depleting the number of infected target cells. This result suggests that the proliferating infected target cells were responsible for the immunodeficiency.\r"

Two mechanisms--unequal crossing over and biased gene conversion--have been the principal explanations of concerted evolution. Concerted evolution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays is thought to be largely the result of unequal crossing over. However, concerted evolution of rDNA in parthenogenetic lizards of hybrid origin is strongly biased toward one of two parental sequences, which is consistent with biased gene conversion as the operative mechanism. The apparent gene conversions are independent of initial genome dosage and result in homogenization of rDNA arrays across all nucleolar organizer regions.\r"

In the developing neural tube the floor plate, which consists of specialized neuroepithelial cells, is located in the ventral midline of the neural tube. When Hensen's node was extirpated the floor plate and notochord did not develop, and the normal differentiation of the ventral horn motor neurons and dorsal and ventral roots did not occur. When one side of the neural tube was deprived of notochord, the ventro-dorsal differentiation took place on both sides. However, when one side of the neural tube was deprived of the floor plate, the ventral horn motor neurons and dorsal and ventral roots did not develop on that side. These observations suggest that the floor plate influences motor neuron differentiation and acts as an intrinsic organizer to establish pattern and polarity in the developing nervous system.\r"

Production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be regulated by signal transduction pathways distinct from those induced by the T cell antigen receptor. Stimulation of CD28, a molecule expressed on most human T cells, induced the formation of a protein complex that bound to a site on the IL-2 gene distinct from previously described binding sites and increased IL-2 enhancer activity fivefold. The CD28-responsive complex bound to the IL-2 gene between -164 and -154 base pairs from the transcription start site. The sequence of this element is similar to regions conserved in the 5' flanking regions of several other lymphokine genes.\r"

Early (30-day) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age. Using logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders. Of these, age was the most important predictor by far.\r"

We analyzed coagulation and fibrinolytic functions in 22 patients with cardiogenic cerebral embolism less than or equal to 24 hours after onset and in 25 age-matched controls. The levels of antithrombin III, protein C, and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.001, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer were markedly higher in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). At the time of admission, the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer in the eight patients at high risk for recurrent embolization (one with prodromal embolism, three with intracardiac thrombi, and four with recurrent embolization) were 2.8 and 3.5 times, respectively, higher than those in the 14 patients without recurrence or thrombus formation. The lowest concentration of crosslinked D-dimer in the eight patients at high risk for recurrent embolization was 600 ng/ml on admission. Our results suggest that patients with acute cardioembolic stroke have various degrees of consumption coagulopathy and that the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer can be useful indicators of those who are prone to recurrent embolization during this stage.\r"

A multivariate analysis in this sample made it possible to improve this correlation to account for more than 90% of the variability in cerebral blood flow by the use of transcranial Doppler measures of velocity and pulsatility along with the patient's age and hematocrit (r = 0.95; p less than 0.001).

In two hypothermic groups ischemia lasted 8 (n = 9) and 12 (n = 9) minutes, respectively, and was followed immediately by the lowering and maintenance of rectal temperature to 34 degrees C for 2 hours. Seven days after the ischemic insult, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were prepared for histologic analysis; the percentage of necrotic neurons among the total neuronal population in selected CA1/2 sectors of the hippocampus was determined. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of necrotic neurons in the central (77.5% versus 55.5%, p = 0.006) and lateral (62.5% versus 38.9%, p=0.005) areas and in the overall CA1/2 sector of the hippocampus (71.8% versus 52.2%, p = 0.008) for the 8-minute hypothermic group compared with the 8-minute normothermic group. In contrast, no differences were detected in any area of the hippocampus between the 12-minute normothermic and the 12-minute hypothermic groups (p = 0.29-0.49). Our data indicate that mild postischemic whole-body hypothermia ameliorates neuronal survival when ischemia lasts 8 minutes but not 12 minutes.\r"

We sought to determine whether circulating neutrophils or platelets contribute to brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke that includes a fixed duration of superimposed systemic hypotension. We randomized 18 rabbits to receive either antineutrophil antiserum (n = 6), antiplatelet antiserum (n = 5), or nonimmune serum (n = 7). We assessed brain ischemia by measuring cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and infarct size. Following the intracarotid administration of an autologous clot, cerebral blood flow in all groups fell to less than 5 ml/100 g/min during induced hypotension. After restoration of baseline blood pressure, mean cerebral blood flow in neutropenic animals recovered to 20-30 ml/100 g/min while that in control and thrombocytopenic rabbits remained at less than 10 ml/100 g/min. Intracranial pressure in control animals rose steadily to a final value of 241% of baseline, while a much smaller increase (148% of baseline) was noted in the thrombocytopenic group; no change from baseline was evident in the neutropenic group. Infarct size was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced in the neutropenic group but not in the thrombocytopenic group. These results suggest that neutrophils may be important contributors to ischemia-induced brain injury whereas the role of platelets is more subtle.\r"

Constriction induced by prostaglandin F2 alpha or the stable thromboxane A2 analogue SQ-26,655 was near-maximally inhibited in calcium-deficient solutions but only partially inhibited by calcium antagonists (10(-5) M verapamil or 3.3 x 10(-7) M nifedipine). Studies of 45Ca binding at different external Ca2+ concentrations showed that cerebral arteries possess two calcium binding sites, a high-affinity site and a low-affinity site. Each prostanoid significantly increased low-affinity 45Ca uptake (external Ca2+ concentration = 1.2 mmol/l) during 5 minutes of 45Ca loading; for prostaglandin F2 alpha 45Ca uptake increased from 69 to 108 nmol/g and for SQ-26,655, from 78 to 141 nmol/g. The prostanoid-induced increases in low-affinity 45Ca uptake were completely abolished by pretreatment with verapamil or nifedipine. Prostaglandin F2 alpha, SQ-26,655, verapamil, and nifedipine had no effect on high-affinity 45Ca uptake (external Ca2+ concentration = 45 mumol/l) or 45Ca efflux (after 60 minutes' preincubation in calcium-deficient media). Prostaglandin F2 alpha and SQ-26,655 each appear to constrict cerebral arteries by two mechanisms: first, by promoting calcium uptake from low-affinity binding sites through receptor-operated channels sensitive to the calcium antagonists, and second, by releasing calcium from depletable internal stores.\r"

The prevalence of hypertension and smoking in both provinces declined between 1972 and 1977, as did the stroke incidence in the 8-year period of follow-up of each cohort. We observed no differences in stroke incidence between the two provinces. The relative risk of stroke in the later period (1977-1985) was 0.71 and 0.58 for men and women, respectively, when compared with the earlier period (1972-1980). Overall, 28% of all stroke events could be attributed to hypertension, 17% to smoking, and 43% to these two factors jointly. The decrease in the prevalence of hypertension and smoking accounted for about 29% of the decline.\r"

N-Acetyl-L-aspartate, the concentration of which is assumed to be stable during hypoxia, has been used to form ratios with lactate. To determine the stability of the signal from N-acetyl-L-aspartate, we used a model of graded hypoxia in rats to monitor the percentage changes from baseline of the peak heights for lactate, lipids, and N-acetyl-L-aspartate. Anesthetized adult rats were exposed sequentially to 15% and 10% O2 while proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected with a surface coil in a 7-T 89-mm-bore spectrometer. Brain lactate concentration was either increased by feeding or infusion of glucose (n = 9) or lowered by fasting (n = 7). After death the brains were removed and frozen, and the water- and lipid-soluble compounds were extracted to identify the origin of the signals. We analyzed the data both as the percentage change from baseline for heights of the lactate (1.33 ppm), lipids (1.5 ppm), and N-acetyl-L-aspartate (2.02 ppm) peaks and as the ratios of heights of the 1.33 and 2.02 and the 1.5 and 2.02 ppm peaks. Both hypoxic episodes caused a 45% decrease from baseline in the 2.02 ppm peak. During the second hypoxic episode, the 1.33:2.02 ppm peak height ratio increased significantly in hyperglycemic rats (p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in hypoglycemic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the effects of lithium chloride on the morphologic outcome after 5 minutes of cerebral ischemia induced in gerbils by occluding both common carotid arteries under brief halothane anesthesia. In three treated groups of 10 gerbils each, 5 meq/kg i.p. lithium chloride was given 2 days, 1 day, and 2 hours before ischemia; 2 hours before ischemia; or immediately after the end of ischemia. Corresponding control groups of nine or 10 gerbils each received equivalent volumes of saline injected at comparable times. All gerbils were perfusion-fixed 1 week later, and neuronal density of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells was determined. Lithium induced very mild intraischemic systemic hypothermia, but postischemic hyperthermia developed in both treated and control groups. Neuronal densities were equal in corresponding groups. The results indicate that our regimen of lithium administration provides no benefit in survival of hippocampal neurons, and intraischemic hypothermia of less than 0.8 degrees C is not protective. Other strategies to inactivate the signal transduction system that is specific for excitatory neurotransmission should be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "First described by Thomas Willis in 1679 and defined in the 1950s, transient ischemic attack is universally agreed to be an episode of focal neurologic deficit in a vascular distribution, sudden in onset and resolving without residual deficit in less than or equal to 24 hours. Transient ischemic attack is diagnosed by characteristic history and absence of residua on neurologic examination. After these criteria had been accepted, regional cerebral blood flow and computed cranial tomography in the 1970s, later positron emission tomography, and even more recently, magnetic resonance imaging reveal prolonged pathophysiologic and metabolic disturbances even in persons with all the definitional characteristics of transient ischemic attack. These persistent abnormalities necessitate reexamination of the validity of the concept of transient ischemic attack. Furthermore, our group suspects that transient ischemic attack is probably only a marker, and not itself the risk factor, for the cerebral infarction which frequently follows transient ischemic attack. Additionally, the surprising frequency with which cerebral infarction, unrecognized by patient or physician, is revealed using neuroimaging techniques has created a need to redefine the categories heretofore used for diagnosis and assessment of therapy and prognosis for transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction.\r"

Nutritional supplementation is essential; however, critically ill patients may not readily tolerate nutritional support. Calories may need to be withheld until the patient is able to tolerate and utilize nutritional support. Once the decision to initiate nutritional support is made, nutritional status, level of stress, metabolic condition, and vital organ function influence the patient's nutritional requirements. An assessment of the patient's metabolic condition provides data useful in determining the need for supplemental electrolytes or macronutrients. These data also provide information regarding vital organ function, which is necessary for utilization of the fuel and substrate. Aggressive monitoring and judicious nutritional supplementation will afford the critically ill patient the best chance of recovery.\r"

H2RAs may alter the absorption, metabolism, or renal excretion of concurrently administered drugs. Gastrointestinal absorption of drugs, such as ketoconazole, that dissolve poorly in the absence of adequate acid may be reduced. Inhibition of hepatic oxidative drug metabolism of agents such as warfarin, theophylline, and phenytoin, is primarily a problem with cimetidine. Adverse effects will be seen in predisposed individuals and the time course will depend on the pharmacokinetics of the object drug. The other H2RAs are less likely to inhibit drug metabolism and affect renal clearance of procainamide than is cimetidine.\r"

Recent data on prophylaxis with EIS fail to support the value of EIS for this indication. Ethanolamine oleate compares favorably with other sclerosing agents, and is the only one currently approved for EIS. The intravariceal method is used more frequently than the paravariceal method because it has better efficacy and can be performed more rapidly. The percentage of patients developing significant complications from EIS may be as high as 15 percent; common complications include retrosternal pain, pyrexia, and sepsis.

Although clinically significant hemorrhage from stress ulceration occurs in only 5-20 percent of patients in the ICU, the associated mortality is greater than 50 percent. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of stress ulcer are not well understood; however, a number of risk factors such as intraluminal gastric acidity and mucosal ischemia have been implicated. To prevent the development of stress ulcers and subsequent complications, it is important to identify and correct these underlying risk factors. Improving mucosal blood flow (i.e., fluid resuscitation and low-dose dopamine) and providing adequate nutritional support are invaluable adjuncts in minimizing the risk of stress ulcer formation. The use of pharmacologic prophylaxis controls the gastric acidity and prevents the formation of stress ulcers. The potential for drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions are of particular concern in the care of critically ill patients. Multiple organ system dysfunction or failure, malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, as well as the use of multiple pharmacologic agents predispose these patients to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics, drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. These changes may alter the pharmacodynamic response to therapy and must be considered when designing drug dosage regimens for critically ill patients.\r"

Ondansetron is an investigational serotonin antagonist that has documented effectiveness for cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. Ondansetron appears to be well tolerated, with the possible exception of headaches and transient increases in liver enzymes. No extrapyramidal toxicities have been reported with this agent. While ondansetron looks promising, further studies are needed to fully define its role as an antiemetic.\r"

  ".W": "Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or noncardiac pulmonary edema, is a form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The goals of treatment for patients with ARDS are to provide supportive therapy, to reverse the underlying etiology or pathology, and to prevent subsequent complications. Supportive therapy consists of supplemental oxygen, positive end-expiratory pressure, and, often, mechanical ventilation. The reversal of the underlying pathology varies according to the etiologic origin of ARDS. Complications from ARDS include stress ulcers, which occur when gastric aggressive and defensive functions become unbalanced. Antacids and cytoprotective agents are used for stress ulcer prophylaxis, but histamine H2-receptor antagonists are now regarded as the standard of care. Because all the marketed H2-receptor antagonists are efficacious, choice of the agent is based on the adverse effect profile and drug interactions. No definitive data currently exist linking stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens that raise intragastric pH to a significant risk for nosocomial pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have assessed the ability of exercise modalities to predict patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Implicit in the use of these prior data to assess the prognosis of patients currently undergoing exercise studies is the assumption that patients selected for exercise assessment are similar over time and that the data generated in the past are therefore applicable to the current patient populations. This study retrospectively assessed the clinical, exercise, and rest and exercise radionuclide angiographic data in 791 consecutive patients referred for exercise radionuclide angiography within 1 month after AMI during a 5-year period to determine if the clinical and exercise characteristics of patients referred for exercise evaluation after infarction have changed significantly over time. Most parameters examined demonstrated significant increasing trends, including thrombolytic therapy at the time of AMI, revascularization procedure between AMI and exercise assessment, age, beta-blocker usage, Q-wave AMI, inferior infarction, exercise double product, exercise capacity, significant ST-segment depression with exercise, peak ejection fraction, and change in ejection fraction with exercise. These data indicate that the characteristics of patients selected to undergo exercise after AMI in a large referral center have changed significantly over time. If these data are applicable to other referral centers and to other exercise testing modalities, previously published results regarding exercise assessment after AMI will need to be reconfirmed in patients currently selected for testing, since these results may no longer be applicable in this current era of aggressive medical and interventional management.\r"

Psychological stress was assessed using the 20-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 1 to 2 days before hospital discharge. Once discharged, patients in the treatment group responded to the GHQ by telephone on a monthly basis and, when they reported high levels of stress symptoms (GHQ greater than or equal to 5), received visits from nurses to help them deal with their life problems. Control patients received routine medical care after discharge. Post-hoc subgroup analyses based on life-table methods showed that, for patients receiving routine care after discharge, high stress (GHQ greater than or equal to 5) was associated with a close to threefold increase in risk of cardiac mortality over 5 years (p = 0.0003) and an approximately 1.5-fold increase in risk of reinfarction over the same period (p = 0.09). In contrast, highly stressed patients who took part in the 1-year program of stress monitoring and intervention did not experience any significant long-term increase in risk. Although program impact was significant in terms of reduction of both cardiac mortality (p = 0.006) and AMI recurrences (p = 0.004) among highly stressed patients, there was little evidence of impact among patients with low levels of stress in the hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After baseline exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic ST-segment monitoring, patients received either nifedipine (mean dose, 80 mg/day) or placebo administered 4 times per day, with the initial dose taken immediately upon arising in the morning. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of each study drug for 7 days, after which they underwent repeat exercise treadmill testing and 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. During exercise treadmill testing, greater exercise duration was achieved by patients receiving nifedipine than by those receiving placebo (421 +/- 121 vs 353 +/- 155 seconds, respectively; p less than 0.05). Time to greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression was significantly greater with nifedipine (282 +/- 146 seconds) than at baseline (130 +/- 72 seconds, p less than 0.003) and with placebo (150 +/- 98 seconds, p less than 0.0005). During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, nifedipine reduced both the total number of ischemic episodes (18 vs 54 at baseline and 63 with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both) and the total duration of ischemia (260 vs 874 at baseline and 927 minutes with placebo; p less than 0.02 for both). The surge of ischemia between 06:00 and 12:00 noted at baseline and during placebo therapy was nearly abolished during nifedipine treatment. Nifedipine at this dosage, administered in this manner, is effective in reducing total ischemic activity and may prevent morning surges of ischemic episodes.\r"

Coronary angiography showed 2- or 3-vessel disease in 7 and 11 patients, respectively. A total of 53 bypass grafts were performed. Before bypass surgery 14 patients had a positive and 4 a negative test result. No complication occurred during the test performed early after surgery.

All 4 patients had negative results before and after surgery. In the 4 patients with positive results after dipyridamole echocardiographic testing before and after bypass surgery, dipyridamole time increased from 5.8 +/- 5 to 9.3 +/- 0.9 minutes (p = 0.3) after the procedure and wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole changed from 1.55 +/- 0.2 to 1.28 +/- 0.3 (p = 0.05). Forty-nine of 53 grafts were patent as seen on angiography. Dipyridamole echocardiographic results were positive in 4 of 5 patients who had at least 1 obstructed graft or native vessel obstructed distal to bypass graft insertion. The remaining patient had diagnostic electrocardiographic changes during dipyridamole infusion without wall motion abnormalities.

Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP). An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode. With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power. In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W). A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter. The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction.\r"

Studies at rest were performed at a constant heart rate between pacing modes, and the exercise study was performed at a constant heart rate and work load.

After titrating the antihypertensive effective dose biweekly from 1 to 8 mg/day and a mean end titration-point dose of 4.14 +/- 0.1 mg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at week 8 of treatment, it was adjusted to maintain diastolic BP at levels less than or equal to 90 mm Hg for up to 12 weeks of treatment when, at a final mean dose of 4.35 +/- 0.2 mg/day, BP decreased in all patients by a mean 31 +/- 3/17 +/- 2 (supine) and 39 +/- 3/15 +/- 3 (standing) mm Hg (p less than 0.005) with no increase in heart rate and no \"first-dose phenomenon.\" Neither the renin-aldosterone system nor electrolyte excretion was significantly affected. Renal function and metabolic parameters also remained unchanged. Urinary kallikrein excretion was augmented 2.47-fold (p less than 0.002). There was good tolerance; 1 patient discontinued the study because of dry nose. These results suggest that long-term monotherapy with doxazosin is an effective and safe antihypertensive agent for mild to moderate essential hypertension that stimulates urinary kallikrein excretion.\r"

The effect of volume loading both before and after balloon mitral valvotomy on computation of MVA by Gorlin and by PHT in 18 patients with high-fidelity micromanometer measurements of left atrial and left ventricular pressure was therefore examined. Echocardiographic MVA increased from 0.91 +/- 0.15 to 1.97 +/- 0.42 cm2 after valvotomy. Volume loading produced significant increases in left atrial pressure (16 to 23 before and 12 to 20 mm Hg after valvotomy), in cardiac output (3.7 to 4.1 before and 3.9 to 4.6 liters/min after valvotomy), and in mitral valve gradient (11 to 14 before and 5 to 7 mm Hg after valvotomy). These hemodynamic changes were associated with modest but significant decreases in PHT and increases in MVA estimated by 220/PHT (0.66 to 0.81 before and 1.64 to 1.96 cm2 after valvotomy), whereas the MVA by Gorlin was not affected in a consistent fashion by volume loading (0.85 to 0.89 before and 1.66 to 1.69 cm2 after valvotomy). The correlation between Gorlin MVA and 220/PHT was only fair (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001) and was significantly poorer among patients with greater than 1+ mitral regurgitation (r = 0.72) than among those with less or no regurgitation (r = 0.79) (p = 0.001 by analysis of covariance for mitral regurgitation effect).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight patients (80%) had VT, 3 (9%) atrial tachycardia and 3 (9%) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 24-hour Holter monitoring. The studies were repeated after a total amiodarone dose of 58 +/- 122 g and during a maintenance median daily dose of 400 mg. Amiodarone abolished paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias in all 6 patients.

Sustained VT was induced in 26 patients (74%) at baseline study and in 23 patients (66%) taking amiodarone therapy. With amiodarone, VT was no longer inducible or was more difficult to induce in 11 patients (31%), and the drug abolished VT during Holter monitoring in all patients.

To determine if preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy could be identified independent of the aforementioned limitations, 25 asymptomatic chronic alcoholics aged less than 40 years (mean 34), each of whom had consumed a minimum of 1 pint of whiskey or one 6-pack of beer greater than or equal to 5 days per week for greater than or equal to 5 years, underwent radionuclide ventriculography for measurements of systolic and diastolic function at rest, peak supine exercise and during recovery, and echocardiography for assessment of chamber size, wall thickness and left ventricular mass. Red blood cell levels of selenium and thiamine were measured to determine whether abnormalities were present in these 2 potential mediators of alcoholic cardiomyopathy. For comparison, an age-matched group of healthy control subjects was also studied. For alcoholics and control subjects at rest, mean ejection fraction (67 +/- 7% vs 71 +/- 6%) and diastolic peak filling rate (3.4 +/- 0.6 vs 3.3 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes per second [EDV/s]) were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the prognostic significance of thallium-201 perfusion defects in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), 43 patients underwent thallium scintigraphy in addition to clinical, echocardiographic, angiographic and hemodynamic evaluation. Eleven patients had no significant thallium perfusion abnormality, 19 had multiple small defects and 13 had a large defect. During 3.2 +/- 2.2 years, 14 patients had disease-related mortality. The patients who died had a higher incidence of ventricular tachycardia (71 vs 31%; p less than 0.02), increased cardiothoracic ratio (60 +/- 6 vs 54 +/- 6; p = 0.005), decreased fractional shortening (11 +/- 6 vs 15 +/- 5; p less than 0.05), increased pulmonary wedge pressure (15 +/- 7 vs 10 +/- 6 mm Hg; p = 0.05), increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (21 +/- 8 vs 14 +/- 6 mm Hg; p = 0.02) and abnormal thallium perfusion defects (13 of 14 vs 16 of 26; p less than 0.05) compared with survivors. Age, gender, left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, cardiac index and ejection fraction were not statistically different in the survivors versus the patients who died. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 100% in patients without significant perfusion abnormality; 89, 77 and 64%, respectively, in patients with multiple small defects; and 84, 76 and 30%, respectively, in patients with a large defect (p less than 0.025 by log rank test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91103172\r", 
  ".W": "Color-flow Doppler is used for special localization of cardiac flows. The transeptal jet in supracristal ventricular septal defect (VSD) is directed toward the pulmonary valve and is often difficult to distinguish from the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract flow. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler can misread the VSD jet as a stenotic lesion in the RV outflow tract. This study describes the color-flow Doppler characteristics of supracristal VSD and determines if color-flow Doppler can differentiate supracristal VSD jets from RV outflow tract flow. The study group comprised 28 patients ranging in age from 3 days to 23 years (mean 6.4), with catheter-diagnosed supracristal VSD in 14, isolated pulmonary valve stenosis in 10 and RV infundibular obstruction in 4. The echocardiographic Doppler and color-flow Doppler data of all patients were reviewed without knowledge of catheterization diagnosis. In all patients with supracristal VSD, color-flow Doppler revealed an abnormal transeptal jet directed toward the pulmonary valve that occurred 5 to 10 ms before RV outflow tract flow was identified. VSD and RV outflow tract jet could be differentiated by pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler alone in 10 of 14 patients (71%). In 4 patients, differentiation was possible only with color-flow Doppler and electrocardiographic gating. Associated aortic regurgitation, or a fistula, or both, were detected in 6 patients. Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler with or without color-flow Doppler correctly identified the level of obstruction in all patients with RV outflow tract lesions (14 of 14). Supracristal VSD jet occurs in early systole and is directed toward the pulmonary valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The correlations of 11 indexes of heart rate variability were examined with pharmacologically determined cardiac vagal tone in 15 normal subjects at supine rest. After sympathetic influences by intravenous propranolol were eliminated, RR interval variability was measured for 10 minutes under controlled respiration (0.25 Hz), and cardiac vagal tone was determined as the decrease in mean RR interval following complete vagal blockade with atropine. Time domain indexes (standard deviation, coefficient of variance and mean successive difference) correlated strongly with vagal tone (r = 0.87, 0.81 and 0.92, respectively; p less than 0.001 for all). The same was true for frequency domain indexes for the high-frequency (0.25 Hz) component calculated both by autoregressive spectrum analysis (square root of power and coefficient of component variance) and by fast Fourier transform (mean amplitude) (r = 0.91, 0.85 and 0.86, respectively; p less than 0.0001 for all). However, frequency domain indexes for the low-frequency spectral component (0.03 to 0.15 Hz) correlated less strongly (r = 0.69, 0.55 and 0.70, respectively), and the fraction of power [power/(total power greater than 0.03 Hz)] of both components showed no correlation. Principal component analysis showed that the first 6 indexes with strong correlations contained solely the first principal component closely related to vagal tone, whereas the remaining 5 indexes also contained the second component unrelated to vagal tone. These results indicate that most of the time and frequency domain analyses in use provides an accurate and common measure of cardiac vagal tone at rest.\r"

Eleven tumors were of nonurachal origin and one of urachal. At diagnosis, one tumor was stage B, two stage C, seven stage D, and two stages unknown. Nine of 12 patients were dead of disease (range, 1-16 months; median, 9 months), 1 alive with metastatic disease, 1 alive and well, and 1 dead of an unrelated cause. From a literature review, the authors accepted 35 cases that met their criteria and combined them with their 12 cases for statistical analysis. Prognosis was worse with a pure diffuse versus a mixed tumor (P = 0.004) and for nonurachal versus urachal origin (P = 0.005). The difference in five-year survival rates between stages B and D disease (P less than 0.05) was also statistically significant.\r"

Overall agreement between the two methods was 78.7%. With the use of Southern blot analysis, HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 was detected in 22 specimens, however, 4 were untypable because of abnormal or smeared band patterns. Dot blot analysis detected HPV 6/11, 16/18, or 31/33/35 in those same 22 specimens and in 9 additional specimens. Eight of the 13 specimens in which HPV was not detected or untypable by Southern blot contained type 31/33/35 by dot blot. Based on convenience of specimen collection and transport, ease of performance and the ability to detect HPV types 31, 33, and 35, the authors are currently using the dot blot assay for the detection and typing of HPV in clinical specimens.\r"

Tumor proliferation rate was analyzed and correlated to tumor size and nodal status. The relationship between Ki-67 proliferative activity and nuclear estrogen receptor content was also investigated on adjacent tissue sections. Ki-67 values ranged from 1 to 75%, with a median value of 10%. Premenopausal patients had greater Ki-67 values (median value, 14.1%) than postmenopausal ones (median value, 9.8%). The authors observed no correlation with lymph nodal involvement, whereas a statistically significant relationship with tumor size was found (P less than 0.01). An inverse correlation (Spearman's coefficient = -0.56; P less than 0.001) was seen between Ki-67 values and nuclear estrogen receptor content. These results, similar to those reported for other kinetic measurements, suggest that in situ detection of Ki-67 proliferation rate is a useful method for obtaining cell cycle information. Follow-up studies will be needed to assess an eventual prognostic relevance.\r"

The findings obtained from the aspirated cells with the use of the fluorescent cytochemical technique were compared with results obtained from the cell population of the same tumor after removal with the use of both the fluorescent cytochemical technique and the biochemical dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. For the needle aspirates, there was 89% concordance for estrogen receptor and 86% concordance for progesterone receptor between biochemical and cytochemical results. A high degree of correlation was also demonstrated between fine-needle aspirates and imprint preparations with the use of the cytochemical technique. This study suggests that the fluorescent cytochemical technique is an effective tool in assessment of estrogen and progesterone receptor content in fine-needle aspirates of primary and metastatic breast cancer. The fluorescent cytochemical technique can be performed easily at community hospitals and is well suited for specimens of insufficient size for biochemical assay.\r"

The Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL), which uses in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) labeling to evaluate cell cycle kinetics without a flow cytometer or radioisotopes, simplifies this assay for the clinical-based laboratory by providing standardized reagents and recommended methods. This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas. Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%. Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors. Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed. Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed. S-phase studies of breast carcinomas using other techniques have shown similar data, therefore, the Cell Proliferation Kit appears to be a practical and useful method for in vitro S-phase analysis that allows concomitant histologic examination of the same tumor tissue sample.\r"

One of them had a 5 x 2.5 cm aneurysmal dilatation, where three secondary branches arose. These venous channels were dilated and tortuous. The longest secondary branch was 133 cm in length and 1.2 cm in mean diameter and led into the placenta. Multiple, severely coiled or straight small branches arising from these vessels were also observed as vascular tangles. Some of these smaller vessels also led into the placenta. All abnormal vessels were veins. The umbilical cord was also normal except for a membranous insertion, and the placenta was unremarkable except for its large size.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred twenty-six effusion samples from 102 patients were examined by cytology and flow cytometry (FCM). Overall, there was an 84% correlation between cytologic and FCM results. Of the 36 malignant cases determined by cytologic examination, FCM revealed an aneuploid peak in 20 (56%). Image analysis (IA) performed on the malignant cytologic cases with a diploid flow pattern detected two additional aneuploid peaks. In addition, FCM indicated three aneuploid cases in which cytologic characteristics were initially interpreted as benign (false negative). Aneuploidy was therefore detected in 64% of the malignant effusion specimens by FCM and IA. Twenty-three of the total of 24 aneuploid cases detected by FCM were associated with malignancy (predictive value = 96%). The one nonmalignant case was that of hemorrhagic pancreatitis with infected pseudocyst. FCM is an excellent tool when moderate to large numbers of tumor cells are present, whereas use of IA is advantageous for specimens containing smaller numbers of malignant cells because these can be directly analyzed. When an aneuploid peak is present, a diagnosis of malignancy must be suspected, and, if the initial cytologic screen is negative, a critical review of the cytology slides is justified. In those cases with an equivocal atypical cytology report and an abnormal cytometric histogram, additional investigation is warranted. In some malignancies the tumor cells will be diploid (in this study 36%) and neither FCM nor IA will add to tumor detection, leaving cytologic examination as the definitive technique.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV.\r"

HTLV-I infection via the transfusion may have been involved in the hematologic improvement seen in this patient.

Included in the study were 1,277 patient samples. On the basis of the currently recommended therapeutic range for prothrombin ratios, a variation of approximately 10% or more between duplicates was considered to be unacceptable. For aPTT assays, the recommended therapeutic range for heparin therapy was usually 1.5 to 2.5 times the baseline value, and variations of up to 25% might be considered acceptable. With these relatively lenient criteria, approximately 2% of PT and 1.3% of aPTT assays had differences between duplicate values that were unacceptable. From this data the authors concluded that the frequency of errors produced by single estimations was too great for satisfactory clinical practice.\r"

Red cell survival was 92% at 1 hour and 88% at 24 hours. Monocyte monolayer assays (MMA) and IgG subclass determinations were performed on samples from: (1) 1965, the period of initial antibody formation; (2) approximately two years before the red cell survival study; and (3) four months after the study. All samples reacted w+ to 1+ by the antiglobulin test. The earliest sample contained IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 anti-Tca. Because there were 20.5% reactive monocytes in the MMA (normal range 0-3%), this antibody may have produced extravascular red cell destruction. In contrast to the initial example, the samples before and after the red cell survival study both contained IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses with 1.3% and 2.2% MMA reactivity, respectively. The current pattern of antibody subclass, the lack of reactivity in the MMA, and a red cell survival of 88% at 24 hours indicate that short-term transfusion support would have been well tolerated. This contrasts to the in vitro results obtained with the earliest sample, which suggest a clinically significant antibody. This appears to be the first report of a red cell alloantibody that remained serologically reactive but underwent a loss of its IgG1 fraction, which appeared capable of red cell destruction based on the MMA results.\r"

Standard therapy for P. carinii is systemically administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine. These agents, however, frequently are associated with serious adverse effects. More recently, aerosolized pentamidine has been proposed as an alternative treatment for those who cannot tolerate standard therapy and as primary and secondary prophylaxis. Inhaled pentamidine is effective, but it is not without hazards. The authors describe a patient with AIDS who received long-term treatment with aerosolized pentamidine and yet died as a result of widely disseminated P. carinii infection.\r"

The cell lines when cultured in vitro in a system mimicking their in vivo environment exhibit cytologic atypia and a variety of defects in morphologic differentiation at early passage compared to their normal counterparts. With increased passage, these alterations progress to more severe grades, histologically similar to CIN III; however only a limited number of the cell lines are tumorigenic, mimicking the epidemiologic evidence on the rate of conversion from premalignant to invasive carcinoma. The observed changes are not associated with alterations of viral DNA integration or expression and may reflect specific cellular events or changes in virus-host interactions associated with malignant progression.\r"

Paired-wise Sialylated-Le(a)/Le(y) and H-2/Le(y) was studied. The Sialylated-Le(a) and Le(y) are synthesized from type 1 and type 2 backbones, respectively. In the normal colon, the Le(y) and Sialylated-Le(a) are expressed by cells at the base and surface of the crypt, respectively, representing undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes. The H-2 is considered oncofetal in nature, and is considered to be the immediate precursor in the synthesis of Le(y). In individual cancers. Sialylated-Lea and Le(y) were detected in different cancer cells within the same malignant glands, separately in different glands, and in different subcellular compartments of the same cell. Both H-2 and Le(y) were coexpressed in the same individual cells in 92% of cancers expressing both these BGA. In 50% of the cancers, the H-2 and Le(y) also were expressed separately in different malignant glands within individual tumors. These findings indicate that, in colorectal cancers, differentiation antigens (Sialylated Le(a) and Le(y)) are expressed by different individual cells within the same malignant gland somewhat, recapitulating the normal colon crypt. Antigens of different backbones occasionally may be expressed in the same cells but within different subcellular compartments. Precursor accumulation is common in cancers, and antigens in the same synthetic pathway are coexpressed in the same cell. The expression of H-2 and Le(y) in different glands (lack of coexpression) may be explained possibly by aberrant synthesis of Le(y) by an alternate pathway.\r"

Twenty-seven additional routinely processed radical prostatectomy specimens were studied using selected probes known to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Three probes, anticytokeratin KA4, anti-vimentin V9, and the lectin from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1), demonstrated phenotypic similarities between PIN and invasive carcinoma. Whereas the luminal cells of normal or hyperplastic prostatic epithelium are minimally reactive with KA4 (4%) or UEA-1 (0%) and strongly reactive with anti-vimentin (91%), both the PIN and invasive carcinoma are reactive with KA4 (89% and 93%, respectively) and UEA-1 (96% and 93%, respectively) and minimally reactive with anti-vimentin (15% and 0%, respectively). The increased KA4 staining was shown to be in part due to detection of cytokeratin 19, by using cytokeratin-19-specific antibodies, 4.62 and LP2K. The reasons for the increased expression of this cytokeratin and the decreased expression of vimentin are unclear but seem to indicate a phenotypic relationship between the PIN lesions and invasive carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of immunologic mechanisms in psoriasis has been deduced from the ability of immunosuppressive therapies to ameliorate this common and chronic skin disease. Certainly the histology of psoriatic lesions suggests a dialogue between the hyperplastic keratinocytes and infiltrating T lymphocytes and macrophages. To begin dissecting the cytokine network involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the location, in both epidermal and dermal compartments, of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and transforming growth factor-alpha at the protein and/or mRNA levels were identified. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was selected as a potentially key regulatory cytokine, first because it induces cultured keratinocyte interleukin-8, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and transforming growth factor-alpha production, and second because intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression by keratinocytes in psoriatic epidermis had been identified previously. Using immunohistochemical localization, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was identified in 12 psoriatic lesions as intense and diffuse expression by dermal dendrocytes (macrophages) in the papillary dermis (without significant staining of endothelial cells, mast cells, or dermal Langerhans cells), and focally by keratinocytes and intraepidermal Langerhans cells. Functional interaction between the dermal dendrocytes and keratinocytes was suggested by the presence of interleukin-8 expression of suprabasal keratinocytes immediately above the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-positive dermal dendrocytes. Interleukin-8 mRNA and transforming growth factor-alpha mRNA were detectable in the epidermal roof of psoriatic lesions, but neither was detectable at the protein or mRNA levels in any normal skin specimens. Treatment of cultured human keratinocytes with phorbol ester (which experimentally produces psoriasiform changes on mouse skin) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha also increased interleukin-8 and transforming growth factor-alpha mRNAs. Further elucidation of the cellular and molecular basis for the genesis and evolution of psoriasis will provide the framework for a better evaluation of the cause and treatment of this skin disease.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the range of pathology shown by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas arising in an epidemiologically well-defined group of patients, all cases of lymphoma recognized in Danish human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals up to the end of 1988 were studied. Twenty-seven cases (26 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 1 Hodgkin's disease) were found, to give a cumulative incidence rate of 8% among Danish AIDS patients. Morphologically most NHL patients were classified into two groups: 1) high-grade tumors with a predominant population of immunoblasts, either monomorphic or more often polymorphic with plasmacytic differentiation; 2) Burkitt-type. Of 26 NHLs, 22 had a B-cell paraffin-section immunophenotype and 4 were non-B, non-T. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was demonstrated in tumor cells of 12 of 24 cases (50%) using in situ nucleic acid hybridization with a 35S-labeled probe in paraffin sections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was found in 65% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 tumors. This study suggests the existence of two main groups of AIDS-related lymphoma with different pathogeneses. First there are immunoblast-rich lesions, which usually are associated with EBV and morphologically resemble lymphomas described in immunosuppressed organ-transplantation patients. Second there are Burkitt-type tumors in which EBV sequences are less common and that may be pathogenetically analogous to sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma.\r"

These MAbs were used to characterize macrophages in situ in the synovial pannus and to study relative antigen expression on the surface of cells isolated from the synovium and from normal peripheral blood. Monoclonal antibody 3D8, an anti-CD13 MAb, reacts with an antigen expressed on the surface of blood monocytes and is a monocyte activation-related antigen that is upregulated by exposure of monocytes to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and LPS. The expression of the 3D8 antigen increases in parallel with MHC class II antigen expression and also is upregulated in culture as monocytes mature to macrophages. 3D8 antigen is expressed strongly on RA synovial tissue lining cells, which are thought to be composed of macrophages. 8D7 antigen expression, detected by MAb 8D7, increases on blood monocytes on cellular activation with LPS and interferon-gamma, but in contrast to the 3D8 antigen, does not increase with monocyte maturation in vitro. The 8D7 antigen is expressed differentially on density-defined macrophage subpopulations isolated from RA synovial tissue and is expressed more strongly on macrophages that are nonangiogenic than those that are angiogenic.\r"

Myotendinous junctions are sites at which thin filaments normally are linked to one another and to the cell membrane, by both lateral and end-on associations between the thin filaments and membrane. The cell membrane at these sites in normal muscle is folded extensively. Dystrophic junctions display normal contacts between the ends of thin filaments and subsarcolemmal densities. However dystrophic junctions are deficient in lateral associations between thin filaments and the membrane and display less membrane folding than controls. These structural defects would result in stress concentrations at sites of thin filament attachment to the membrane, which can cause membrane tearing during muscle activation, especially in large-diameter and mature muscle cells. This deficiency in dystrophic myotendinous junction structure may contribute to our understanding of previously unaccountable aspects of the etiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies against all three leukocyte Fc gamma R classes stained placental villous macrophages. Placental villous trophoblasts were stained intensely by anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb 3G8, while both anti-Fc gamma RI (MAb 32) and anti-Fc gamma RII MAbs IV3, KU79, CIKM5, 2E1, KB61, and 41H16) antibodies did not react with these cells. Anti-Fc gamma RII MAbs IV3, KU79, CIKM5, 2E1, KB61, and 41H16 immunostained placental villous capillary EC, in contrast to anti-Fc gamma RI MAb 32 and anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb 3G8, CLB-Granl, and B73.1, which did not bind. Anti-Fc gamma RI MAb 32, anti-Fc gamma RII MAb IV3 and CIKM5, and anti-Fc gamma RIII MAb 3G8 did not react with the ECs of tonsil, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, lung, or uterus. Similarly no EC staining was seen with these four MAbs in 14 skin and 14 kidney biopsies from subjects with immune-complex diseases. Fc gamma R antigens are expressed constitutively only by placental villous ECs and are not induced on nonplacental ECs by immune-complex-mediated diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomic site of pulmonary fluid leakage in endotoxemia in rats was investigated using the red blood cell packing method and low-dose horseradish peroxidase as a tracer. To differentiate between arterioles and venules in a given section by light and electron microscopy, human red blood cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were administered to the rat pulmonary arterial trunk at a pressure of 40 cm water. Fixed red blood cells were packed in the lumina of arteries, arterioles, and a few capillaries surrounding arterioles, while veins, venules, and almost all capillaries were void of red blood cells in the lumina. Fifteen minutes after the intravenous administration of 3 and 30 mg/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin, extravascular leakage of horseradish peroxidase from venules (nonmuscular veins) was evident. Two hours after the intravenous injection of the same doses of endotoxin, some arterioles (nonmuscular arteries) and venules (non-muscular veins) showed extravascular leakage of horseradish peroxidase, while few capillaries showed this leakage. These results suggest that pulmonary fluid leakage occurs predominantly through venules in the early phase of endotoxemia (at 15 minutes), while the arterioles contribute to fluid leakage in addition to venules in the late phase of endotoxemia (at 2 hours).\r"

At 8 or 12 hours after exposure, surfactants were isolated separately from lung lavage (extracellular surfactant) and residual lung tissue (intracellular surfactant) for phospholipid analysis. Calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was measured on a microsomal fraction prepared from the tissue homogenate. Smoke inhalation produced a twofold increase in extracellular surfactant total phospholipid. While there was no change in the total phospholipid or phosphatidylcholine (PC) content of the intracellular surfactant, smoke inhalation significantly decreased the disaturated species of PC (DSPC). The specific activity of PLA2 was reduced by more than 50% in both groups of exposed mice. Smoke inhalation appears to result in selective depletion of the DSPC of intracellular surfactant and PLA2 involved in its synthesis. This depletion may be compensated for by increased secretion or slower breakdown of the material present in the extracellular compartment.\r"

To determine if this parameter can be correlated with antibody deposition in a model of MN induced by an autologous mechanism and thus more analogous to human MN, the relationship of urinary C5b-9 to ongoing glomerular immune complex formation late in autologous immune complex nephritis (AICN) was studied. Based on urinary C5b-9, the animals were divided into two groups at 12 weeks after induction of AICN, those with persistently high urinary C5b-9 excretion and those in whom urinary excretion of C5b-9 returned to undetectable levels. While all rats developed glomerular deposition of rat IgG and significant proteinuria, high C5b-9 excretors had greater proteinuria and prolonged positive staining for glomerular C3. When normal syngeneic kidneys were transplanted into rats (n = 3) from each group, only those with persistent C5b-9 excretion developed subepithelial immune deposits of rat IgG in the transplanted kidney. As in the PHN model of MN, proteinuria was dissociated widely from urinary C5b-9 excretion, glomerular C3 staining, and evidence of circulating antibody. Thus these findings demonstrate that urinary excretion of C5b-9 serves as an index of on-going immunologic disease activity in the AICN model of MN, while proteinuria does not.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular permeability factor (VPF), a tumor-secreted heparin-binding protein (Mr approximately 38,000), is responsible for increased vessel permeability and fluid accumulation associated with tumor growth. Vascular permeability factor also promotes the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and bovine pulmonary ECs in vitro. It is shown for the first time that guinea pig VPF (half-maximal and maximal dose approximately 0.4 and 22 pmol/l (picomolar), respectively), as well as human VPF, are potent stimuli for human ECs resulting in [Ca2+]i increases (maximal three- to fourfold) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Unlike the maximal responses to thrombin and histamine, the [Ca2+]i response to a maximal VPF dose was preceded by a characteristic 10- to 15-second delay. Guinea pig VPF also selectively increased [Ca2+]i in cultured aortic and pulmonary artery ECs, but not aortic smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts, or neutrophils. Affinity-purified rabbit antibody (raised to a synthetic peptide representing VPF N-terminal amino acids 1 to 24) adsorbed all vessel permeability-increasing activity, EC growth-promoting activity, and specifically all activity responsible for increasing EC [Ca2+]i. Similar to other mediators that increase [Ca2+]i in cultured ECs, VPF also induced a 200% increase in von Willebrand factor release. Together these data indicate that VPF acts directly on ECs and that rapid cellular events in its in vivo/in vitro actions are likely to involve phospholipase C activation, [Ca2+]i increase, and von Willebrand factor release.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assay for the presence of collagen synthesis stimulatory activity in the kidney during immune-induced renal injury that results in severe fibrosis in both glomerular and interstitial compartments. A model of antiglomerular basement (anti-GBM) disease in the rabbit was induced on day 0 by the injection of anti-GBM antibody and renal cortex tissues were then sampled at various time points. Only conditioned media prepared from diseased renal cortical samples showed collagen synthesis stimulatory activity when tested on rabbit mesangial cells. The activity had an estimated molecular weight range of 16 to 25 kd and was neutralized by antibody to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). A standard assay for TGF-beta using a mink lung epithelial cell line confirmed the increase in TGF-beta activity in conditioned media of diseased cortex from day 7 and day 14 animals, which was not significantly activated by previous acidification. This suggests that most of the TGF-beta present in renal conditioned media was in the active form. The increase in renal cortical secretion of active TGF-beta was accompanied by increases in renal cortical TGF-beta mRNA content on days 4 and 7 after induction, with subsequent return to control levels. A similar increase in TGF-beta activity was present in nonacidified conditioned media of purified glomeruli from diseased days 7 and 14 animals, which was also accompanied by significant increases in TGF-beta mRNA. However with acidification no significant differences were noted between control and diseased samples, suggesting the presence of substantial latent TGF-beta activity in control glomerular conditioned media. These same control-conditioned media contained inhibitor activity for added exogenous TGF-beta. These results support the conclusion that the association between increased TGF-beta secretion and increased renal cortical collagen synthesis in this model is consistent with a role for this cytokine in directing fibrogenesis in the kidney.\r"

In the presence of a vasodilator substance (PGE2, CGRP) picomolar (pmol/l) amounts of NAP-2 induced neutrophil accumulation and plasma leakage on intradermal injection in rabbit skin, whereas the longer forms, beta TG itself and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), had no such effect. NAP-2-induced increased in microvascular permeability was neutrophil dependent and fast in onset, with a half-life of 65 to 75 minutes, comparable to that previously reported for the structural-related neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8). However NAP-2 showed a lower potency in that more protein was needed to provoke skin reactivity. Nevertheless the finding that a platelet release product can elicit neutrophil-mediated inflammation further narrows the gap between thrombotic events and inflammatory disorders.\r"

Alpha 1-antichymotrypsinlike immunoreactivity was enhanced by protease digestion but not by formic acid pretreatment. Almost all of the diffuse plaques and some small amyloid deposits, which were widely distributed in the cerebral cortex and/or subcortical regions of SDAT brains, were labeled by alpha 1-antichymotrypsin immunostaining. All types of senile plaques, eosinophilic tangles, and some neurons and astrocytes were labeled by alpha 1-antichymotrypsin staining. Diffuse plaques in a Down's syndrome frontal lobe and in a senile dementia of the Alzheimer type cerebellum also were labeled by alpha 1-antichymotrypsin immunostaining. However neither subpial amyloid deposits nor subcortical small amyloid deposits could be detected by alpha 1-antichymotrypsin immunostaining. Kuru plaques in a Gerstmann-Strausslar-Scheinker disease cerebellum also were not labeled by alpha 1-antichymotrypsin immunostaining. These results suggest that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is associated with the early to late stages of amyloid deposition and senile plaque formation in senile demential of the Alzheimer type.\r"

The results obtained were compared with those of nodular LPHD (nodular paragranuloma). In conventional stains, nodular/diffuse LPHD differed from diffuse LPHD in the presence of nodularity, which can be best demonstrated with silver impregnation. Immunohistologic analysis showed a correlation of the difference in nodularity with the presence or absence and pattern of follicular dendritic cell (FDC) meshwork, ie, a relatively sharply defined and large spherical meshwork was present in nodular areas of nodular/diffuse LPHD, whereas FDCs were either absent or present in a diffuse, ill-defined meshwork, usually of small size, in the diffuse zones of nodular/diffuse LPHD and in diffuse LPHD. The amount of FDC meshwork corresponded roughly to the number of reactive B cells and T cells, meaning that in diffuse areas significantly fewer B cells and more T cells were observed than in nodular areas. The immunohistologic analysis also showed that the antigen profile (positivity with the monoclonal B-cell marker L26 in the majority [14/20] of cases and negativity for CD15 in all but one of 20 cases) of the tumor cells in both nodular/diffuse LPHD and diffuse LPHD were comparable while it was different from the antigen profile (L26- and CD15+) in most cases of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity types of HD. This suggests that the considered subtypes of LPHD differ mainly in FDC pattern, but not in origin and nature of the tumor cells. This further justifies assignment of the above-mentioned LPHD subtypes to the category paragranuloma (LPHD).\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and beta 2 (TGF-beta 2) are equipotent in many cell systems studies thus far. Recent data, however, show different effects elicited by these two growth factors in specific biologic systems. This investigation compares the effects of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), rat epididymal fat pad microvascular endothelium (RFCs), and bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (BASCs). In two-dimensional cultures, proliferation of BAECs, BASMCs, and RFCs were all inhibited by TGF-beta 1, while in response to TGF-beta 2, BASMCs were fully inhibited, RFCs were modestly inhibited, and BAECs were unaffected. Bovine aortic endothelial cell migration was significantly inhibited by TGF-beta 1, but only slightly inhibited by TGF-beta 2. In contrast, BASMC migration was enhanced by TGF-beta 1 and was not affected by TGF-beta 2. In three-dimensional cultures, RFCs were stimulated to undergo in vitro angiogenesis in response to TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 at 10-fold higher concentrations. Three distinct receptor assays demonstrated the presence of type I and type II TGF-beta 1 cell-surface-binding proteins on BAECs, BASMCs, and RFCs. Labeled TGF-beta 1 was competed off completely with 100-fold molar excess unlabeled TGF-beta 1, but only partially with equivalent excess unlabeled TGF-beta 2. Furthermore the ratios of type I to type II TGF-beta receptors in these three vascular cell types vary from 1:1 in BAECs to 1.5:1 in RFCs to 3:1 in BASMCs and can be correlated with the differences noted in cellular responses to TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 in proliferation, migration, and in vitro angiogenic assays. These findings support the hypothesis that there are different responses to the TGF-beta s, depending on the cell type and experimental conditions as well as the TGF-beta concentration and isoform used.\r"

Seven of two hundred eighty-six (2.4%) genital tract tissues in which HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization contained two or more different HPV types. When analyzed by site, 5 of 204 (2.4%) of cervical intraepithelial lesions were infected by more than one type, compared with 2 of 82 (2.4%) of vulvar lesions. The rate for low-grade lesions was similar (5/218; 2.3%) to that for high-grade lesions (2/68; 2.9%). In contrast, two different HPV types were detected in 6/33 (18%) of tissues by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using type-specific primers for eight HPV types. It is concluded that infection by one HPV type is rarely associated with concurrent 'active' infection by a second HPV type, even though DNA of a different viral type can be detected by PCR in about one fifth of such cases. Further study is required to determine if an existing HPV infection can inhibit replication by a different HPV type.\r"

The inflammatory cells comprised macrophages (up to 30%) and T cells (up to 80%), with a high ratio of Lyt2+ to L3T4+ cells throughout. Although the H-2 genotype affects murine cytomegalovirus replication at the level of individual cells, and hence resistance to lethal infection, it did not determine resistance to cardiopathy per se. However BALB/c, BALB.B, and BALB.K mice developed persistent myocarditis regardless of age at infection, and age-related cardiopathy was frequent and severe in infected and uninfected mice. B10 and B10.BR mice also developed myocarditis after neonatal infection, but inflammation resolved rapidly after adult infection and age-related cardiopathy was correspondingly mild. C3H mice exhibited minimal carditis after neonatal or adult infection. However neonatal infection appears to accelerate age-related cardiopathy, which is severe in retired breeders of this strain.\r"

  ".W": "Human cord blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 35 days in media containing recombinant human interleukin 5 (rhIL-5) supplemented with a fraction of the culture supernatant of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human T lymphocytes from which interleukin 2 (IL-2) was eliminated. Cultured cells were studied by electron microscopy and an immunogold procedure to detect subcellular site(s) of Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein. The majority of cells (greater than 70%) developing in this system were mature eosinophils, with descending frequency of other cells, including macrophages, mature basophils, eosinophilic myelocytes, and mature neutrophils. Mature eosinophils were characterized by increased numbers of primary granules, small granules, tubulovesicular structures, and decreased secondary granules. These eosinophils showed extensive piecemeal degranulation (PMD) characterized by partially empty and empty secondary granule chambers in the cytoplasm. Small, smooth vesicles were evident within empty granule chambers as well as adjacent to them. Eosinophils formed close associations with phagocytic macrophages that contained both standard-shaped and irregularly shaped CLC within phagolysosomes. Subcellular sites of CLC protein were demonstrated by immunogold in eosinophils and macrophages arising in these cultures. Charcot-Leyden crystal protein was present in the nuclear matrix and extraorganellar cytoplasm of eosinophils. Primary granules and some cytoplasmic vesicles were labeled for CLC protein, but full and empty secondary granules and the extensive network of tubulovesicles were not. Charcot-Leyden crystals were absent from eosinophils, nor were they present in the extracellular space. Charcot-Leyden crystals were absent from eosinophils, nor were they present in the extracellular space. Charcot-Leyden crystals within phagosomes of macrophages were labeled by the immunogold procedure for CLC protein. These results demonstrate that rhIL-5-supplemented, PHA-stimulated, T-cell-conditioned media induced the development of mature human eosinophils from cord blood cells. These eosinophils underwent PMD of secondary granule contents. Immunogold analysis showed eosinophil CLC protein in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and primary granules of eosinophils. Macrophages also were present in these cultures. They contained CLC protein-containing crystals in their phagosomes, suggesting active sequestration of eosinophil CLC protein by macrophages in vitro.\r"

The frequency of IGF-I in adrenocortical carcinomas was significantly higher than that in adenomas of the adrenal glands. The adrenocortical carcinomas showed strong intensity of staining for IGF-I, IGF-I receptors, and insulin receptors. A significant correlation between immunoreactivity and receptor expression of both IGF-I and insulin was found only in the adrenocortical carcinomas. The adrenocortical adenomas with Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytomas, more than adrenocortical adenomas with Conn's syndrome, also stained strongly for insulin receptors. Thus the IGF-I and insulin probably play a role in the growth of adrenocortical carcinoma tissues, possibly through autocrine mechanisms. The expression of insulin receptors in adrenocortical adenomas in the presence of Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytomas may be associated with functions.\r"

FGF5 gene expression was detected in the characteristic Kaposi's sarcoma spindle-shaped cells in the five samples from human immunodeficiency-positive (HIV+) patients. FGFB transcripts were detected in Kaposi's sarcoma cells as well as in epidermis of HIV- and HIV+ patients. These results complement the observations about growth factor gene expression done on Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cell lines, which thus appear to be representative of what happens in vivo. Furthermore, they demonstrate a contrasting expression pattern of FGF5 and FGFB genes, both involved in the growth factor pathogenic cascade leading to Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "Whole animal studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) plays a central role in the endotoxin response. In vitro studies show that TNF alpha and endotoxin induce a similar range of metabolic changes to endothelial cells. However both endotoxin- and TNF alpha-induced cytotoxicity is not a feature of all endothelial cells lines. In recent studies, the authors have shown that endotoxin causes different responses in endothelial cells taken from two levels of the lung's circulation--main pulmonary artery and lung microvasculature. Endotoxin exposure caused cell death for cells cultured from the large pulmonary artery but not for those taken from lung periphery. The present study examined the effect of TNF alpha on endothelial cells cultured from two levels of the lungs' circulation--the main pulmonary artery and the lung microvasculature. End points examined included lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostacyclin, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release and phase contrast microscopy. Exposure to TNF alpha resulted in a dose-dependent increase in LDH release and number of detached cells for cells of the pulmonary artery, whereas cells from the microvasculature seemed unaffected. At both levels, however, TNF alpha caused increased release of both prostacyclin and PGE2. The authors conclude that TNF alpha causes different effects in endothelial cells cultured from two levels of the same organ.\r"

This model divides projective identification into three steps. Step 1 is the projection of a part of oneself onto an external object. Step 1a is the blurring of self and object representations. Step 2 is an interpersonal interaction in which the projector actively pressures the recipient to think, feel, and act in accordance with the projection. Step 3 is the reinternalization of the projection after it has been psychologically processed by the recipient. The different definitions of projective identification are shown to relate to exactly how the term \"projection\" is conceptualized (in step 1), to whether step 1a is deemed necessary, and to how many of the three steps are required for the definition of projective identification. The author reviews the work of Ogden, Kernberg, Meissner, Sandler, Malin and Grotstein, Porder, and Zinner et al. Six detailed case examples are provided from within and outside psychotherapy to illustrate all three steps of projective identification.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: As a result of combined biophysical and molecular biological studies, important insights into the structure and function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors have been achieved. These insights have helped to define the role of GABA receptors in synaptic inhibition and the ion channel mechanisms by which different neuropsychiatric drugs work. The authors' goal is to describe the actions of GABA as a neurotransmitter and discuss the modulation of receptor function by different drugs. DATA COLLECTION: The authors focus on more recent studies of the structure and physiology of the receptor-ion channel complex and the relevance of these studies to psychiatry. FINDINGS: The CNS effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol have been linked to the GABA-chloride channel receptor complex. Multiple subunits of this complex have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in heterologous systems. The results of cloning studies, coupled with membrane biophysics, have provided important insights into the structure and function of GABA receptors and their modulation by psychopharmacological agents. CONCLUSIONS: Future understanding of disease states, drug effects, and therapeutic successes and failures may be expressed in terms of differences in the structure and function of specific receptors and their associated ion channels. Furthermore, the ability to describe the molecular function of receptor subtypes offers the ability to tailor drug specificity by developing agents directed against a given receptor subtype. The current GABA studies also have important implications for the understanding of how neurotransmitter systems may be involved in illness.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The relation of poor health to the onset of depression symptoms in late life is well recognized, but little attention has been given to characteristics that might predict persistence or remission of depressive symptoms. In previous analyses the authors found that increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms in older community residents and accounted for 70% of the variance explained by discriminant analyses. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the relevance of changes in health and disability to the persistence of depressive symptoms. METHOD: A representative sample of 1,855 adults aged 65 or older were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at baseline. Twenty-four months later, 1,577 individuals were available for a second assessment of depressive symptoms. The characteristics of the 97 community residents whose depressive symptoms persisted over 24 months were compared to those of the 114 whose symptoms remitted. RESULTS: Changes in health, differences in age, sleep disturbance, and added formal support services accounted for more than 30% of the variance between the persistently depressed and remission groups. Advanced age and worsening health were associated with persistent symptoms, improved health with remission. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have indicated that untoward changes in health and disability play a major role in the onset of depressive symptoms. These findings show a substantial contribution to chronicity as well.\r"

The authors' objective is to better characterize the affective component of PTSD. METHOD: The subjects were 45 male psychiatric inpatients at a Veterans Administration medical center; 28 met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD and 17 met Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for major depressive disorder. All of the subjects with PTSD were Vietnam veterans. The 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to assess state measures of symptom severity, and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire was used to measure dimensions of dependency, self-criticism, and self-efficacy. RESULTS: The mean total Hamilton scale score of the patients with PTSD was nonsignificantly higher than that of the patients with major depressive disorder; patients with PTSD had higher scores on almost all individual Hamilton symptoms, particularly insomnia, somatic anxiety, and diurnal variation. Patients with PTSD had significantly higher scores on the self-criticism scale but not on the dependency and self-efficacy scales of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire. The scores of patients with PTSD on the dependency and self-criticism scales were negatively correlated. No significant differences between patients with PTSD with and without concurrent major depressive disorder were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of such depressive dimensions of PTSD as dependency and self-criticism may have important clinical implications.\r"

Diagnoses for 723 directly interviewed relatives of 326 probands with primary unipolar depression were compared to diagnoses in 469 control subjects chosen by an acquaintanceship method to demographically resemble the relatives of affective disorder probands. Diagnoses in the uninterviewed relatives of both control and depressed subjects were used for comparisons as well. RESULTS: Results indicated higher rates of alcoholism in the families of depressed women but not in the families of depressed men.

Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose. Lithium-induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects.\r"

It was hypothesized that patients who improved abruptly would differ from patients whose improvement was gradual in that they would tend to improve earlier and would tend to have less persistent improvement. METHOD: The subjects were 144 patients who met the DSM-III criteria for depressive illness and were randomly assigned to placebo medication in four double-blind antidepressant drug trials. All studies lasted 6 weeks. Mood change was rated each week on a 7-point scale; a rating of 1 or 2 was considered an indication of improvement. Improvement was judged to be abrupt if the first score of 1 or 2 was immediately preceded by a score of 4 or worse, and it was classified as gradual if the first score of 1 or 2 was preceded by a score of 3 in at least 1 week. Improvement was considered persistent if a score of 1 or 2 was not followed by a score of 3 or worse in any subsequent week. RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 72 showed clinical improvement during at least one weekly visit; 33 improved abruptly and 39 improved gradually. The abrupt improvements occurred significantly earlier in the trial and were less likely to persist than the gradual improvements regardless of when they occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that among patients receiving placebo abrupt improvements are a form of placebo response and gradual responses may be the result of spontaneous remission. These preliminary observations require validation.\r"

Since previous data suggested that in the first 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment specific drug effects are unlikely, the authors hypothesized that this improvement is a placebo effect. Therefore, in the first 2 weeks of antidepressant treatment abrupt and gradual improvements should have the characteristics of their placebo counterparts. METHOD: The subjects were 263 patients in controlled antidepressant trials lasting 6 weeks. RESULTS: The percentage of abrupt improvements that occurred in the first 2 weeks was higher than that for gradual improvements. Abrupt improvements during the first 2 weeks of drug treatment were also less persistent than gradual improvements with drug and no more persistent than improvements with placebo during the same period. However, in weeks 3, 4, and 5, abrupt and gradual improvements with drug were equally persistent and both were more persistent than abrupt improvements with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the authors' findings about placebo. Abrupt improvements during treatment with both drug and placebo are more likely during the first 2 weeks of treatment and are less likely to persist than gradual improvements. The fact that persistence of abrupt improvements with drug in weeks 1 and 2 appears different from that of gradual improvements but appears no different after week 3 suggests that the mechanism of action of abrupt improvement with drug changes after week 2.\r"

METHOD: To assess the effect of changes in ownership and types of inpatient settings on the structure of the mental health services system, the authors surveyed a national sample of nonfederal mental health facilities in 1988. RESULTS: Comparing their data to those of earlier surveys, they found that a decline in the number of patients per staff occurred in most settings over the last decade, suggesting that this aspect of quality of care may have improved. They observed important ownership-related differences in 1988 in diagnostic mix (e.g., more schizophrenia treated in public facilities than in private ones) and in payer source (e.g., more third-party revenues in public facilities than occurred in the past). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant interaction between ownership form and type of facility, suggesting that the type of inpatient setting, ownership, and the relation between the two should be considered in assessing the impact of privatization on the accessibility of health care available for the mentally ill. The authors found that the increase in private psychiatric hospitals has widened the availability and choice of treatment facilities for those with private funding sources (especially children and adolescents) but has not had a similar effect in increasing sources of care for the seriously mentally ill dependent upon public financing.\r"

METHOD: The study group was composed of 214 women out of 230 patients consecutively admitted to an inpatient eating disorders program. Twelve men and four patients with atypical eating disorders were excluded from study. The 214 patients were divided into three groups: 87 with anorexia nervosa alone, 72 with anorexia and bulimia nervosa, and 55 with bulimia nervosa alone. The comparison group was composed of 61 women drawn from 125 consecutive participants in a survey of university students. Fifty-six men were dropped from the comparison group, along with eight women who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for eating disorders. Each subject used a three-dimensional measure to rate her body size and stated her desired body size at seven points: left biceps, left calf, left thigh, waist, abdomen, hips, and bust. The subjects' measurements at each of these points were taken. Distortion in body image was calculated as the subject's perceived body size divided by her actual body size. All subjects were also given a battery of tests of intelligence, skill, and memory. RESULTS: All three patient groups differed significantly from the comparison group in distortions in body image. Most but not all patients with eating disorders had distortions in their body image. CONCLUSIONS: If replicated, these findings would suggest that the diagnostic criteria regarding disturbance of body image for both anorexia and bulimia need to be revised.\r"

An investigator-designed questionnaire was circulated to all psychiatric residents in Canada through the directors of postgraduate training programs. To ensure confidentiality, the residents returned their questionnaires directly to the investigators. RESULTS: Of the 314 respondents, 4.1% (N = 6) of the female residents and 1.2% (N = 2) of the male residents reported sexual involvements with their educators. Although the majority of these eight residents had positive or neutral feelings about the contact, 37.5% (N = 3) of the involved residents had mixed feelings. The residents' education concerning resident-educator sexual contact was strikingly sparse. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for inclusion of this tissue in residency programs.\r"

The author examined the effect of adding financial management to the therapeutic management of such patients. The null hypothesis was that this would have no effect on the duration of alcohol-related hospitalization. METHOD: All 61 alcoholic patients registered with an alcohol outpatient clinic who received financial management over a period of 6 years were included in the study. Their alcohol-related disabilities were so severe that they had resulted or were likely to result in lengthy or frequent periods of hospitalization. The financial management involved putting each patient's income into a checking account for which a budget advisory officer was cosignatory for withdrawals. The advisor saw to it that patients' basic living requirements were being met and that expenditure on alcohol was not having a detrimental effect. Participation was voluntary for voluntary patients and involuntary for committed patients. The durations of each patient's alcohol-related hospitalizations were compared for two equal periods of time before and after financial management was instituted. RESULTS: The null hypothesis was not supported. The duration of alcohol-related hospitalizations after financial management was instituted was 86% less than it was before such management. CONCLUSIONS: For the patient who is struggling in the face of excessive drinking to cope with the tasks of daily living, including the provision of adequate shelter and nutrition, the benefits of adding financial management to other therapeutic strategies should be considered.\r"

Each patient received ratings on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Global Assessment Scale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms at admission and at discharge, an evaluation of premorbid adjustment, and an extensive interview on drug and alcohol use. RESULTS: Forty (48%) of the patients received diagnoses of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. The drug-abusing patients primarily used cannabis (N = 26), alcohol (N = 21), and cocaine (N = 14) and reported that they abused drugs to get \"high,\" to relieve depression, and to relax. They had significantly fewer positive and negative symptoms at discharge, better sexual adjustment and worse school performance during adolescence, and more family histories of drug abuse than the non-drug-abusing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenic patients who abuse drugs may represent a subgroup of patients with better prognoses and less severe clinical characteristics of schizophrenia, but their drug abuse may adversely affect global outcome.\r"

The authors hypothesized that if a dose-response relationship was obvious for this drug, the response rate could be significantly amplified. METHOD: Following an 8-24-day dose titration phase, 29 inpatients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia diagnosed according to DSM-III-R were given a clozapine dose of approximately 400 mg/day for 4 weeks; blood samples were obtained weekly during this period. RESULTS: A receiver operator curve demonstrated that the threshold clozapine plasma concentration for therapeutic response was 350 ng/ml. Sixty-four percent of the patients with clozapine plasma concentrations greater than 350 ng/ml responded, whereas only 22% of the patients with concentrations less than 350 ng/ml responded. CONCLUSIONS: Use of clozapine blood levels as a predictor for treatment response in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients appears worthwhile, since the measurement's sensitivity for response was 64% and the specificity for nonresponse was 78%.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to estimate the prevalence of severe mental disorders in a representative sample of sentenced prisoners. METHOD: The subjects were selected as a random sample of sentenced prisoners in Melbourne's three metropolitan prisons. Interviews were conducted with 158 men and 31 women. Clinicians used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) to diagnose psychotic, affective, and substance use disorders. RESULTS: Six prisoners (3%) received current diagnoses of psychotic disorders, and 23 (12%) were diagnosed as having current mood disorders, mainly major depression. A lifetime diagnosis of at least one mental disorder each was made for 82% of the respondents, and in 26% more than one lifetime disorder was diagnosed. Sixty-nine percent received lifetime diagnoses of dependence on or abuse of alcohol, other psychoactive substances, or a combination of these. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not indicate a large-scale shift of deinstitutionalized psychotically ill people from mental hospitals to prisons. They do, however, highlight the diversion into the corrections system of substance-dependent people and the apparent pool of prisoners with largely untreated major depression.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical profiles of psychotic patients whose fasting levels of plasma free homovanillic acid (HVA) were elevated on the day after admission to the hospital. METHOD: These 85 subjects with nonorganic psychoses had been previously studied with respect to their response to neuroleptic treatment. They were divided into two groups on the basis of a median split of their pretreatment plasma HVA levels, and the two groups were compared on a number of clinical and demographic variables ascertained during their hospital stay. Fasting levels of plasma free HVA and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The high-HVA group tended to show a better prognostic profile than the low-HVA group; however, the only significant difference between groups was in the greater use of psychotogenic drugs by low-HVA males. Fourteen additional psychotic patients with distinctly elevated HVA levels and normal MHPG values were also diagnostically heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that psychotic patients with different diagnoses who have relatively high levels of plasma free HVA before treatment will show a favorable early response to neuroleptic drugs. There may be neurobiological processes linking some patients across the clinical spectrum of the psychotic disorders.\r"

To evaluate whether impaired olfaction may indicate CNS disease, the authors measured odor identification in patient groups defined along a continuum of progressive immunodeficiency and in a comparison group. METHOD: Most of the 42 HIV-infected patients in the study were outpatients in a clinic specializing in treatment of HIV-infected individuals. The comparison subjects were 37 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals who were recruited from hospital and medical school personnel. Ten of the patients were HIV-seropositive but had no symptoms, 24 had clinical evidence of immunocompromise, and eight had HIV dementia. All subjects were given the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which presents common odorants and requires the subject to identify the odor from a four-item word list. The data were analyzed by using analysis of variance after arc-sine transformation and Scheffe post hoc analysis. RESULTS: All patients scored significantly lower on the Smell Identification Test than did the comparison subjects. The patients with HIV dementia had significantly lower scores than did the other two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, impaired olfaction might serve as a marker of early CNS HIV involvement. Future studies should attempt to match comparison and experimental populations for socioeconomic status and HIV risk behavior.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHOD: This study tested hypotheses about patterns of familial association between attention deficit disorder (ADD) and anxiety disorders among 356 first-degree relatives of 73 clinically referred children with ADD and 26 normal comparison children. Through structured diagnostic interviews with trained raters, relatives were assessed for adult and childhood psychopathology. After stratifying the sample of ADD probands into those with anxiety disorders and those without, the authors examined patterns of aggregation of ADD and anxiety disorders in the relatives of these probands as well as in the relatives of the normal comparison subjects. RESULTS: Familial risk analyses revealed that 1) familial risk for anxiety disorders was higher among all ADD probands than among the normal subjects; 2) familial risk for ADD was similar in the relatives of the ADD probands and of the probands with ADD and anxiety disorder; 3) the relatives of the ADD probands with and without anxiety disorders were at greater risk for ADD than the relatives of the normal subjects; 4) the risk for anxiety disorders was two times higher in the relatives of the probands who had ADD with anxiety disorder than in those of the ADD probands without anxiety disorders; and 5) there was a tendency for ADD probands' relatives who themselves had ADD to have a higher risk for anxiety disorders than ADD probands' relatives who did not have ADD (cosegregation). CONCLUSIONS: The results were most consistent with the hypotheses indicating that ADD and anxiety disorders segregate independently in families.\r"
