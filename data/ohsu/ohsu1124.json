Infarction, hemorrhagic crusts, and ulcers were present in 10% to 25% of the patients and were relatively more common in type I cryoglobulinemia than in the other types. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was noted in 40%. Lesions on the leg were common in all types of cryoglobulinemia; however, lesions on the head and mucosal surfaces suggested type I cryoglobulinemia. Histopathologic features were classified as vasculitis in 50%, inflammatory or noninflammatory purpura in 15%, noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis in 10%, and postinflammatory sequelae in 10%. Noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis was relatively more frequent in type I. Thus erythematous to purpuric lesions on the legs and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are the common cutaneous findings in cryoglobulinemia. Type I cryoglobulinemia is suggested by noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis, cutaneous infarction, hemorrhagic crusts, skin ulcerations, and lesions of the head and neck and of oral or nasal mucosa.\r"

Primary screening by direct immunofluorescence revealed the characteristic immune deposits in the vessel walls of the upper dermal plexus in all cases and at the dermoepidermal junction in five of seven cases. Type IV collagen and laminin were reactive in six and five cases, respectively, and appeared in the floor of the bulla. The findings were identical in porphyria and pseudoporphyria. In one case in which the bullous pemphigoid antigen could be detected, it appeared in the epidermal roof of the bulla. These findings indicate that the split in porphyria and pseudoporphyria occurs in the lamina lucida. We propose that a multistep mechanism involved in the induction of blisters may be similar in porphyria and pseudoporphyria.\r"

By immunophenotyping, these neoplasms expressed leukocyte common antigen and HLA-DR but did not show consistent immunostaining for B-cell or T-cell differentiation antigens. Expression of nonspecific histiocytic markers such as lysozyme and alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in three cases. By genotyping, three cases retained a germline configuration and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was observed in one case, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was found in one case, and both types of rearrangements in one case. Of the three patients in whom gene rearrangements were noted, two rapidly died and the other patient, with a dual genotype, is still alive 15 years after diagnosis. The three patients without gene rearrangements are alive and well after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. It appears that cutaneous lymphomas with an uncertain phenotype include at least some cases of authentic B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. The germline configuration that we observed in cases with a chronic course remains difficult to explain. It may be related to a low malignancy form of histiocytic lymphoma, an atypical polyclonal hyperplasia, or even a low-grade lymphoma arising from a primitive cell without established commitment to either B- or T-cell lineage.\r"

This study is designed to examine the effect of electrical stimulation on mast cells in acute wounds. Four pathogen-free pigs received 20 wounds, each of which was subjected to biopsy at various times after wounding. Half of the wounds were treated with electrical stimulation and the other half were treated with a sham electrode. The biopsy specimens were fixed in Carnoy's medium and stained with alcian blue and Nuclear Fast Red. Mast cells from both sets of wounds were counted and analyzed. Highly significant reductions in the number of mast cells were seen with electrical stimulation on days 1 and 2 compared with nonstimulated control wounds. Electron microscopy was performed to compare the stimulated and control mast cells for characteristic features in morphology, location, and evidence of degranulation. Electrical stimulation did not appear to induce degranulation. The ability of electrical stimulation to decrease the number of mast cells may be related to a reduction of either proliferation or migration of these cells and may prove to be a valuable therapeutic technique.\r"

  ".U": "91349349\r", 
  ".W": "Levels of serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured in 170 patients with psoriasis (49% with coexistent psoriatic arthritis) who had liver biopsies performed during or before treatment with methotrexate or, in some cases, with retinoids. Psoriasis patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis in their liver biopsy specimens had a significantly higher mean serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen than did patients without fibrosis and without arthritis. Only 4% of patients without cirrhosis or fibrosis and no arthritis had an elevated serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. In contrast, 38% of patients with psoriatic arthritis had an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of detectable liver fibrosis. It is concluded that the number of liver biopsies performed on methotrexate-treated psoriasis patients with or without arthritis may be reduced to a minimum as long as serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen is normal. Increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen in the absence of arthritis is a strong indicator of liver fibrogenesis and suggests the need for liver biopsy to monitor possible methotrexate-induced toxicity. In patients with psoriatic arthritis an increased aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen may be related to the joint disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis and increased levels of aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen should therefore follow the established guidelines for the use of methotrexate in psoriasis.\r"

In all patients, histologic examination revealed a focal accumulation of mucin in the upper mid dermis, associated with increased dermal cellularity. The mucin was composed predominantly of hyaluronic acid, with small amounts of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. The cells within the lesion were fibroblasts. The lesions slowly regressed after L-tryptophan was discontinued. Proposed explanations for the L-tryptophan-related eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have centered on contaminants, chemically related to L-tryptophan, introduced in the manufacturing process. Tryptophan metabolites have been linked with sclerotic cutaneous diseases but have not been previously implicated in cutaneous mucinoses.\r"

A standard photopatch test tray of 32 substances was applied to the back of patients with suspected photosensivity. After applications for 24 hours, test sites were irradiated with 10 joules/cm2UVA. Unirradiated controls were included. Readings were performed immediately and 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation; responses were qualitatively graded on a 4-point scale. All data were stored and processed by a computer. With computer-assisted analysis of reaction patterns photoallergic reactions were identified and distinguished from phototoxic reactions. Data of 1129 patients were evaluated. Among a total of 2859 positive test reactions in 870 patients, 2041 in 778 patients were found to be photoinduced and 818 in 413 patients were contact reactions; 108 reactions in 83 patients were classified as photoallergic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disinfectants, sunscreens, phenothiazines, and fragrances caused most often photoallergic reactions. Many unspecific phototoxic reactions were induced by tiaprofenic acid, promethazine, carprofen, chlorpromazine, fenticolar, wood balsam of Peru, and perfumes. Despite the distinction between photoallergic and phototoxic responses, many test reactions lacked relevance for the patients' dermatoses.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 11 cases of neurothekeoma are reported. One case was examined by electron microscopy. The mean age of the patients was 27.1 years; the study comprised eight female and three male patients. Most lesions were nondescript papules and located on the upper part of the body, seven cases of neurothekeoma on the head. Eight cases were classified as cellular neurothekeoma on the basis of a striking fascicular pattern and three cases as myxomatous neurothekeoma because of prominent myxoid stromal change. All cellular neurothekeomas failed to express S-100 protein, whereas the three myxomatous types were strongly positive for this marker. Other than vimentin, there was no significant immunoreactivity with other immunohistochemical markers. Ultrastructural study of one case of cellular neurothekeoma was inconclusive for cell type although a perineurial origin could not be excluded. On the basis of these results, we conclude that cellular neurothekeoma differs from myxomatous neurothekeoma not only by clinical and histologic findings but also by immunoreactivity with S-100 protein. These findings also suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of neurothekeoma and possible origin of the two variants of neurothekeoma from different cell types or at least variation in phenotypic expression of a common cell type. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these two variants are different stages in the natural history of neurothekeoma.\r"

  ".W": "The use of streptokinase (SK) as a recall antigen (Ag) for stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was evaluated. SK is a potent stimulant, inducing a greater response than three other Ags, tetanus toxoid, Candida albicans extract, or streptolysin. The optimum stimulatory concentration is 1000 U/ml, and peak stimulation occurs between days 6 and 8. Human cord-blood lymphocytes do not respond to SK, suggesting that it is an Ag and not a mitogen. The response rate in an adult population was 82%, higher than the rate of two other Ags tested (tetanus toxoid or Candida). These findings demonstrate the ability of SK to act as a potent recall Ag for human lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.\r"

Serum from nine patients with atopic dermatitis and a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge to peanut were used to begin the process of identification and purification of the major peanut allergens. Identification of a major peanut allergen was accomplished by use of anion-exchange column chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, thin-layer isoelectric focusing, and IgE-specific immunoblotting. Anion-exchange chromatography revealed several fractions that bound IgE from the serum of the challenge-positive patient pool. By measuring antipeanut-specific IgE in the ELISA and in IgE-specific immunoblotting, we identified an allergenic component with two Coomassie brilliant blue staining bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mean molecular weight of 63.5 kd. Examination of this fraction by the IgE antipeanut ELISA with individual serum and by the ELISA-inhibition assay with pooled serum, we identified this fraction as a major allergen. Thin-layer isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of this 63.5 kd fraction revealed it to have an isoelectric point of 4.55. Based on allergen nomenclature of the IUIS Subcommittee for Allergen Nomenclature, this allergen is designated, Ara h I (Arachis hypogaea).\r"

  ".W": "Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) therapy has been recently proposed as alternative therapy for patients with severe steroid-requiring asthma. Several questions have been raised regarding the mechanism of action, including alteration of pharmacokinetics of two medications used in these patients, specifically, glucocorticoids and theophylline. To address this question, pharmacokinetic studies were performed at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment with either intramuscular MTX or placebo (folic acid). Plasma concentrations of theophylline were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (TDx, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Ill.). Prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and cortisol concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fifteen adults were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. No change in prednisolone pharmacokinetic parameters was found. Theophylline clearance decreased an average of 19% in patients randomized to receive MTX, from 48.0 +/- 2.0 ml/hr/kg to 38.9 +/- 3.6 ml/hr/kg (p less than 0.05). This change resembles change observed with theophylline and phenobarbital clearance in which a high degree of interpatient variability is observed. The most likely explanation for the change in theophylline clearance is inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity. Three patients complained of adverse effects, and dosage was reduced in one patient. The variable effect of MTX on theophylline clearance indicates that theophylline concentration monitoring should be performed in patients receiving both drugs.\r"

EOSs are heterogeneous cells in that different states of activation have been ascribed to EOSs of varying densities. We therefore studied the ability of PAF to induce hypodense and normodense EOS chemotaxis. Both hypodense and normodense EOSs were isolated in pure form from seven subjects and studied concurrently. Dose-response and time-course experiments indicated no significant differences in PAF-induced hypodense versus normodense EOS chemotactic responses. Hypodense and normodense cells achieved maximal chemotaxis in response to 1 mumol/L of PAF, and maximal chemotaxis was achieved at 2 hours. However, marked differences in PAF-induced EOS chemotactic responses existed between patients. We conclude that PAF is a potent EOS chemoattractant, and despite reported differences in metabolic activity, normodense and hypodense EOSs exhibit similar chemotactic responsiveness to PAF.\r"

Inhalation challenges with either synthetic LTC4 or LTE4 were performed after prior inhalation of aerosolized SK&F 104353 or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Airway responsiveness to each agonist was determined by the cumulative dose of agonist required to induce a 35% fall in specific airway conductance (PD35) as determined by linear interpolation of the log dose-response curve. There was no change in baseline specific airway conductance after inhalation of either placebo or SK&F 104353. LTC4- and LTE4-induced bronchoconstrictions were significantly inhibited by aerosolized inhalation of SK&F 104353 30 minutes before challenge. The geometric mean (GM) PD35 of LTC4 on the open-therapy and placebo-therapy days was 0.043 nmol (range, 0.01 to 0.1 nmol) and 0.036 nmol (range, 0.01 to 0.1 nmol), respectively. On the treatment day with SK&F 104353, it was not possible to obtain a GM PD35 LTC4 up to a maximum concentration of 0.52 nmol LTC4 (p less than 0.01). The GM PD35 of LTE4 on the open-therapy and placebo-therapy days was 0.30 nmol (range, 0.13 to 0.76 nmol) and 0.39 nmol (range, 0.14 to 0.9 nmol), respectively. On the treatment day with SK&F 104353, it was not possible to obtain a GM PD35 LTE4 up to a maximum concentration of 5 nmol LTE4 (p less than 0.005). Thus, LTC4- and LTE4-induced bronchoconstrictions are both inhibited by SK&F 104353.\r"

Detection of serum anti-BV was determined either by the Phadebas RAST test for IgE and IgG concentrations or by isoelectric focusing followed by capillary blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Clonotypic analyses of Ab were made with specific probes for BV or BV anti-Id; 13/14 nonreactive multiple-sting beekeepers (93%; p = 0.00006) and 3/3 patients receiving BV IT (100%; p = 0.0026) had detectable amounts of BV anti-Id in serum, whereas five BV-sensitive patients (0%) and four ragweed-sensitive control patients (0%) did not. Beekeeper's serum containing BV anti-Id was found to recognize and bind to IgE anti-BV idiotype from two different patient sources and inhibit their reactions in a Phadebas RAST test in a dose-dependent manner. Nonreactive beekeepers generally had BV-specific IgE levels less than 0.35 PRU/ml in serum with detectable BV anti-Id. BV-allergic patients before IT had elevated BV-specific serum IgE levels, even in the presence of BV-specific IgG greater than 136 U/ml with no BV anti-Id present. These findings provide strong support for a protective role of BV anti-Id against bee sting--allergic reactions.\r"

Subjects began with a steroid taper and then were randomized to a 3-month trial of drug or placebo therapy. Subjects received 15 mg of MTX a week or identical placebo. A 1-month washout period was completed before the crossover trial. Symptom scores, peak flow rates, spirometry, and beta-agonist frequency were closely monitored. Ten subjects completed the study. The average dose of prednisone during the placebo-treatment period was 11.97 mg/day compared to 8.37 mg/day while subjects were taking MTX. This was a 30% reduction in daily steroid requirement (p less than 0.01). Symptom scores and spirometry did not differ between the crossover trials, and overall clinical status was not altered. Complications from MTX were mild and included anorexia, alopecia, and stomatitis. All complications resolved with dose reduction or when MTX was stopped at the end of the study. No subjects withdrew from the study because of MTX complications. Low-dose MTX significantly reduced the steroid requirement in this group of subjects with steroid-dependent asthma. This reduction in steroid requirement was obtained without altering clinical status and without significant complication.\r"

Seventeen adults (aged 24 to 76 years) and one child (aged 10 years) were treated intravenously and/or orally with beta-lactam antibiotics after negative skin tests were obtained with benzylpenicilloyl polylysine, potassium penicillin G, and alkaline hydrolysis products of penicillin G as minor determinant mixture. Repeat skin testing was performed 1 to 12 months after the therapy. Three patients (16%) became skin test positive after the treatment. Two patients reacted to potassium penicillin G alone, and the other patient reacted to benzylpenicilloyl polylysine and minor determinant mixture. These three patients were among the 15 patients who were treated with intravenous antibiotics. This study reveals a high percentage of skin test conversion after intravenously administered penicillin therapy and confirms the present practice of advising patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have successfully completed penicillin treatment to have a repeat skin test before future exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics.\r"

PBMC supernatants from six atopic individuals, with eosinophilia, and six normal subjects, with no eosinophilia, were compared for EOS viability-enhancing activity with the same target EOSs. Optimal conditions for the production of viability-enhancing activity by mononuclear cells were established as a 24-hour culture period, with a concentration of 2 x 10(6) cells per milliliter. Comparison of monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched culture supernatants for the production of the EOS viability-enhancing activity indicated that both cell types released the factor. C-18 Sep-Pak separation of the PBMC culture supernatant yielded a major EOS viability-enhancing activity in the aqueous eluent, suggesting a hydrophilic molecule. This major activity was neutralized by a specific antibody to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor but was unaffected by specific antibodies to interleukin-3 and interleukin-5. A second, minor viability-enhancing activity was observed in the 100% methanol fraction, indicating the presence of a more hydrophobic molecule. The supernatants from the PBMCs of the atopic individuals consistently enhanced EOS survival to a greater extent than supernatants from the PBMCs of the normal, nonatopic individuals.\r"

In this article, we describe the methodology for performing the ESA, demonstrate the kinetics for optimal use in both B-lymphoblastoid lines and fresh B cells, and determine the correlation between the ESA and immunoglobulin secretion under various experimental conditions. This assay permits an estimate of the level of immunoglobulin secreted per cell, thus distinguishing expansion of immunoglobulin-secreting cell populations from increases in average (per cell) immunoglobulin production. The combination of ESA and quantitation of immunoglobulin in supernatants of cultured cells provides an easy and reliable means for studying the regulation of immunoglobulin secretion.\r"

This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of FCB during a 12-month treatment period in patients with perennial rhinitis. Treatment was initiated with one inhalation of FCB in each nostril three times a day (total dosage, 3 mg/day). In subsequent months, one third of the patients was maintained at the dosage of 3 mg/day, one third at a lower dosage of 2 mg/day, and the remaining one third of the patients at a larger dosage of 4 to 8 mg/day. Of 109 patients enrolled in the study, 90 patients (82.6%) completed all 12 months of treatment. Symptom and sign scores decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) at the 2-month evaluation compared to scores at baseline, and the improvement was maintained throughout the 12-month study period. After 12 months, greater than 80% of the patients had substantial control of symptoms. Specimens of nasal biopsies, performed at the beginning and end of treatment, revealed a decrease in eosinophils and other cellular infiltrates, a slight tendency of an increase in mast cell counts, and a trend toward normalization of the nasal mucosa. There were few adverse effects. Mean plasma cortisol levels were normal before and after corticotropin stimulation at baseline and after 12 months of FCB therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "B cell activation by the lipopeptide trispalmitoyl-cysteinyl-alanyl-glycine (TPP), the biologically active moiety of bacterial lipoprotein, results in protein kinase C (PKC) translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, as well as a significant increase in the activity of membrane-associated PKC that can be observed by in vitro incubation with TPP of partially purified PKC at calcium concentrations in the range of those prevailing in unstimulated B cells. TPP does not affect either the phosphoinositide turnover or the cytosolic-free calcium concentration, but promotes an increase in the intracellular pH that can be blocked by the PKC-inhibitors staurosporine or H-7. Moreover, incubation of B cells with staurosporine suppressed the proliferative response promoted by TPP at a half-maximum effective dose of 16 nM. Activation by TPP of PKC isoenzymes resolved after hydroxylapatite chromatography revealed that the resulting beta I/beta II isoenzyme was more sensitive than the alpha isoenzyme. These results suggest that TPP might mediate B cell activation via interaction with the membrane-associated fraction of PKC.\r"

  ".W": "The T cell surface molecule CD4 (L3T4 in mouse) is important in the T lymphocyte response to Ag presented in association with MHC class II molecules. To examine the role of CD4 in immune function, we expressed a soluble form of murine CD4 by deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the L3T4 gene and transfecting the altered gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The recombinant soluble mouse CD4 (smCD4) retained the native conformation of the external portion, as indicated by the binding of L3T4 mAb. In vitro, smCD4 did not inhibit class II-dependent, Ag-specific, T cell proliferation or MLR, even at concentrations 300-fold greater, on a molar basis, than that of anti-CD4 mAb. Immunization of mice with smCD4 induced a strong anti-CD4 response. These antibodies showed some binding to native cell surface CD4, indicating that immunization with smCD4 generated an anti-self response. Analysis of lymphoid cells from spleen, lymph node, and thymus of smCD4-treated mice revealed no alteration in subset phenotypes. Also, Th cell function, as measured by response to soluble Ag, was not compromised. Thus, smCD4 did not inhibit T cell activity in vitro, and the autoimmune response arising from immunization with smCD4 had no apparent consequences for normal immune function.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a new mAb, anti-1A4, which recognizes an epitope on the CD27 molecule distinct from those recognized by several known anti-CD27 mAb. Although it has been suggested that the CD27 molecule is a T cell activation Ag, there was little direct evidence that the structure was involved in the T cell activation process. In this study, we showed that anti-1A4 inhibited anti-CD2, anti-CD3, mitogens, or soluble Ag-induced T cell proliferation as well as PWM-driven B cell IgG synthesis. Interestingly, anti-1A4 inhibited IL-2 secretion without affecting IL-2R expression. In addition, pretreatment of T cells with anti-1A4 inhibited the normally sustained intracellular calcium mobilization seen after triggering of T cells via the CD2 or CD3 pathways. Thus, binding of anti-1A4 to the CD27 molecule appears to induce a negative effect on T cell activation. This may be due to either a direct signal to T cells or the blocking of an interaction between T cells and accessory cells or both. These findings support the notion that the CD27 molecule plays an integral role in the process of T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "91349566\r", 
  ".W": "Susceptibility to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), which is induced in mice by injection of purified Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (TAChR), is influenced by the I-A locus products, which restrict presentation of AChR Th epitopes. The bm12 mutation of the I-Ab molecule in the C57BL/6 strain, which is highly susceptible to EAMG, yields the EAMG resistant mutant B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12). We investigated here the consequences of the bm 12 mutation on the CD4+ response to the TAChR alpha subunit. Upon immunization with TAChR, CD4+ cells became sensitized to TAChR and anti-AChR antibodies were produced in both bm12 and C57BL/6 strains. Overlapping synthetic peptides, corresponding to the complete sequence of TAChR alpha subunit, were used to identify Th epitopes. CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized peptides T alpha 150-169, T alpha 181-200, and T alpha 360-378. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice did not respond to any synthetic sequence. Upon injection of the three C57BL/6 Th epitope peptides, either individually or as a pool, CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized each peptide and TAChR. Therefore they recognized epitopes similar or identical to those originated from TAChR processing. CD4+ cells from bm12 mice injected with the same peptides responded to T alpha 360-378 strongly, to a lesser extent to T alpha 181-200, never to peptide T alpha 150-169. Only CD4+ cells sensitized against the T epitope peptide T alpha 181-200 responded to TAChR. We tested if lack of response to T alpha 150-169, and the low response to T alpha 181-200, was due to inability of the I-Abm12 molecule to present the T epitope peptides. bm12 and C57BL/6 APC were used to present the T epitope peptides to specifically sensitized CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice. All T epitope peptides were presented by bm12 APC, although T alpha 150-169 was presented less efficiently than by C57BL/6 APC. Resistance to EAMG induced by the bm12 mutation may be due to the change in the epitope repertoire of AChR-specific Th cells, and lack of recognition of otherwise immunodominant Th epitopes. For at least one epitope this might be due to absence of potentially reactive, specific CD4+ clones.\r"

  ".U": "91349567\r", 
  ".W": "The role of host anti-donor cells in rejection of fully allogeneic donor T cell-depleted marrow was investigated by using mAb or immunotoxins directed against T cell or NK cell determinants. Immunotoxins consisting of mAb conjugated to a low oligosaccharide-containing fraction of purified ricin toxin A chain (RTA) facilitated in vivo-depletion of target cell populations. BALB/c and DBA/1 donors were selected based upon their expression (BALB/c) or lack of (DBA/1) hemopoietic histocompatibility (Hh1) Ag, which may serve as targets for donor rejection in C57BL/6 hosts. When studies directed toward eliminating CD3+ cells were performed in both systems, injections of intact anti-CD3 mAb or anti-CD3-RTA reproducibly produced the highest engraftment values. The fact that engraftment values obtained with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3-RTA therapy in allogeneic systems were substantially higher than in syngeneic controls suggested that engraftment stimulatory proteins were released upon TCR engagement. Elevated levels of cytokines and a high mortality rate in allogeneic recipients confirmed that this was the case. Nonstimulatory preparations of anti-CD3F(ab')2 fragments and anti-CD3F(ab')2-RTA promoted engraftment of both types of allogeneic marrow, as measured by short term 125I-IUdR assays, suggesting that stimulation was not a prerequisite for engraftment. Recipients of anti-CD3F(ab')2 or anti-CD3F(ab')2-RTA showed a marked reduction of host CD3+ cells as measured by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. In long term chimerism studies, recipients of Hh1-disparate marrow and anti-CD3F(ab')2 had a dramatic increase in donor cell engraftment as compared to controls, indicating that positive effects on engraftment were long lived. Studies further showed that BALB/c donor cells exhibiting an Hh1 disparity were rejected by host cells expressing NK1.1 or Ly-1 (NK cells and T cells). In contrast, DBA/1 donor cells that were not Hh1-disparate were rejected by cells expressing Ly-1, but not NK1.1 (T cells only). These studies provide definitive data that CD3+ cells participate in the rejection of either Hh1+ or Hh1null T cell-depleted allografts and offer new strategies for alloengraftment using regimens containing nonmitogenic anti-CD3.\r"

Presently only limited data are available regarding the specific epitopes recognized by these CTL. In this study, we have performed a detailed examination of the gag-specific CTL response in three HIV-1 seropositive subjects, using both unstimulated PBMC and cloned CTL. Lysis of gag-expressing targets was found to be mediated by CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes and restricted by class I Ag. Multiple class I Ag were found to restrict gag epitopes in each subject studied, with as many as three of these Ag involved in presenting gag CTL epitopes in a single subject. The majority of gag-specific CTL activity was found to be directed against epitopes in the p24 subunit of the gag protein, with at least seven different HLA class I-restricted CTL p24 epitopes identified in these three subjects. Less CTL activity was directed against p17 subunit of gag and two CTL epitopes were identified in this protein. Although as many as four different epitopes in gag were recognized using CTL from a single subject, none of the epitopes was recognized by CTL from more than one subject. Analysis of gag epitope recognition using cloned CTL demonstrated heterogeneity and specificity not appreciated using unstimulated PBMC. The identification of multiple relatively conserved epitopes in the HIV-1 gag protein and the heterogeneity of CTL responses to this protein may have important implications for vaccine development and our understanding of AIDS pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes may synthesize simultaneously both the agonist IL-1 beta and a specific receptor antagonist of IL-1 (IL-1ra). These studies examined whether monocyte production of these two structurally related cytokines was regulated differently. IL-1ra and IL-1 beta protein levels in cell supernatants and lysates were measured with specific ELISA. Relative steady-state mRNA levels, relative transcriptional rates as determined by the nuclear run-on technique, and mRNA stability were all assessed using specific cDNA probes. Monocytes were stimulated with LPS alone, adherent IgG, or both LPS and adherent IgG. Monocytes stimulated with LPS produced near equivalent amounts of IL-1ra and IL-1 beta proteins over 22 h; relative steady-state mRNA levels paralleled the protein levels. In addition, LPS-induced monocytes exhibited enhanced rates of transcription for both IL-1ra and IL-1 beta, in comparison to adherent control cells without LPS. mRNA half-lives in LPS-induced monocytes also were similar for IL-1ra and IL-1 beta. Monocytes cultured on adherent IgG exhibited a low level of IL-1 beta transcription with an absence of protein production. In contrast, adherent IgG led to a high and prolonged rate of IL-1ra protein production. Furthermore, monocytes cultured on adherent IgG exhibited a specific induction of IL-1ra transcription and a marked prolongation in IL-1ra mRNA stability. However, LPS in a high concentration, 1 microgram/ml, reversed the IgG induction of IL-1ra production by decreasing both transcriptional rate and mRNA stability. These results indicate that production of IL-1ra by human monocytes is characterized by different patterns of regulation in comparison with IL-1 beta. LPS induces production of both proteins whereas adherent IgG stimulates only IL-1ra production. The effects of IgG and LPS on induction of IL-1ra production in human monocytes are mediated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.\r"

Serial sections stained for different types of APC, including B cells, interdigitating dendritic cells, and macrophages, demonstrate a close physical association between IL-2+ cells and macrophages.

  ".U": "91349574\r", 
  ".W": "IL-12, formerly known as cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor, is a cytokine that stimulates proliferation of PHA-activated human peripheral blood lymphoblasts and synergizes with low concentrations of IL-2 in the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells. IL-12 is a 75-kDa heterodimer composed of disulfide-bonded 40-kDa and 35-kDa subunits. mAb prepared against a partially purified preparation of natural IL-12 have been characterized by 1) immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled IL-12, 2) immunodepletion of IL-12 bioactivity, 3) Western blotting of IL-12, 4) inhibition of [125I]IL-12 binding to its cellular receptor, and 5) neutralization of IL-12 bioactivity. Twenty antibodies immunoprecipitate 125I-labeled IL-12 and immunodeplete IL-12 bioactivity as assessed in the T cell proliferation and lymphokine-activated killer cell induction assays. Western blot analysis demonstrated that each antibody binds to the 75-kDa heterodimer and to the 40-kDa subunit. An IL-12R-binding assay identified 12 individual antibodies that inhibited the binding of [125I]IL-12 to its cellular receptor. Two inhibitory antibodies, 4A1 and 7B2, were tested in the neutralization assay and found to block IL-12 bioactivity whereas one noninhibitory antibody, 8E3, was shown not to neutralize IL-12 bioactivity. Antibodies 4A1 and 8E3 can simultaneously bind to the 75-kDa heterodimer demonstrating that inhibitory and noninhibitory epitopes are spatially distinct on the 40-kDa protein. The ability of antibodies specific for the 40-kDa subunit of IL-12 to block receptor binding of [125I]IL-12 and to neutralize IL-12 bioactivity suggests that localized determinants on the 40-kDa subunit may be necessary for binding to the IL-12 cellular receptor.\r"

The second signal activates B cells and is delivered by T cells, EBV infection, or engagement of the B cell-specific Ag CD40. Hydrocortisone (HC) has recently been shown to synergize with IL-4 to induce IgE synthesis in CD5+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. We show herein that a combination of HC and rIL-4 induces IgE synthesis in highly purified normal peripheral blood B cells. HC and IL-4 acted directly on B cells, because T cells and monocytes were not required for IgE synthesis. IgE induction was shown to occur in surface IgE- B cells isolated by cell sorting. These results suggest that IgE synthesis results from isotype switching, rather than from expansion of a precommitted B cell population. Furthermore, IgE synthesis was induced in sorted CD5- B cells, indicating that the ability to produce IgE in response to HC and IL-4 is not constrained by CD5 expression. Endogenous IL-6 was critical for induction of IgE synthesis by HC and IL-4, because an anti-IL-6 antibody strongly inhibited IgE production. These data suggest that hormones may play an important role in the regulation of IgE synthesis.\r"

Binding of iodinated IL-1 beta was evaluated by autoradiography on cytosmears of IL-1RII positive B cell lines RAJI, the RAJI clone 1H7, and STS 25. Results obtained suggest an heterogeneity of IL-1RII expression within the B cell population, with only 5 to 16% of the cells able to bind IL-1 beta. Up-regulation of IL-1RII expression by dexamethasone, evident in conventional binding assays, was achieved through both increase in the number of IL-1 binding cells (14-30%) and augmentation of receptor density on positive cells, By combining autoradiography with immunocytochemical staining, it could be shown that about 80% of IL-1RII + cells were negative for Ki67, a nuclear antigen expressed from late G1 to M phase. Cell cycle dependent expression of IL-1RII was confirmed on cells enriched in different phases of the cell cycle by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. It is thus proposed that IL-1RII is associated to the cell cycle.\r"

It was specifically down-modulated after stimulation of monocytes by physiologic activating/differentiating agents such as bacterial LPS and IFN-gamma, by the pharmacologic agents PMA and calcium ionophore A23187, and by anti-CD14 antibodies. The down-modulation was almost totally blocked at 4 degrees C or at pH 4.5 and markedly inhibited by the protease inhibitors diisopropylfluorophosphate and PMSF. A soluble labeled CD14 was isolated from culture supernatant of surface iodinated monocytes after their activation, indicating that CD14 is shed from the cell surface rather than internalized. The size of the soluble CD14 shed from the monocytes in vitro was smaller than that of either the membrane-bound form or a soluble CD14 cleaved from the cell surface by phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C, but identical to the size of one of the two major soluble CD14 forms normally found in human serum. These data suggest that CD14 shedding induced by monocyte stimulation may play an important role in the regulation of surface CD14 expression.\r"

The failure of mb-1 cDNA to hybridize with mRNA from J558 delta m2.6 plasmacytomas expressing surface mIgD in association with IgD-alpha has led to the conclusion that IgM-alpha and IgD-alpha are not closely related. In this report we have used protein biochemical methods to characterize differences in the mIgM- and mIgD-associated alpha chains. In addition to a slightly greater apparent m.w., IgD-alpha was slightly more acidic than IgM-alpha. The alpha chains had nearly identical proteolytic peptide maps, and were also noted to have multiple loci of identity with MB-1 based on amino terminal sequencing and immunoblotting. In an attempt to determine whether the alpha chains differed as a result of differential posttranslational modification, they were compared after deglycosylation with N-glycanase. The results indicate that the apparent m.w. as well as isoelectric point differences are primarily due to differential N-linked glycosylation. These studies indicate that IgM-alpha and IgD-alpha are products of the mb-1 gene or closely related genes.\r"

  ".W": "Among all classes of Ig, IgE exhibits the highest rate of fractional catabolism of which the site and mechanisms is not understood. We construct a panel of murine B cell hybridomas to investigate the catabolism of IgE; one of these hybridomas, 17A11, constitutively expresses high levels of type II IgE FcR (Fc epsilon RII, CD23) (Kd:1.77 nM; B max: 1.65 x 10(5], and is capable of clearing receptor-bound IgE. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of IgE ligand ensues after binding monomeric and DNP-BSA:IgE immune complexes, and the binding is inhibited by treating 17A11 with anti-CD23. IgE ligands are sequestered and are not susceptible to acid stripping from the cell surface. The internalized IgE ligands redistributed into acid hydrolase containing high density lysosomal vesicles and were degraded; metabolic inhibitors such as chloroquine and monensin that elevate intracellular pH of 17A11 also prevent entry of IgE ligand into lysosomes. These observations raise the possibility that normal Fc epsilon RII-bearing mature B cells in the circulation and lymphoid tissues may function in sequestration and catabolic turnover of IgE molecules through IgE or IL-4 up-regulated Fc epsilon RII uptake; B cell Fc epsilon RII may perform an important role in determining the short biological half-life of IgE molecules, and contributes to IgE homeostasis.\r"

The CD59 immunoprecipitate contained also a small amount of the CD55 glycoprotein and the CD55 immunoprecipitate minute amount of the CD59 Ag. These results are interpreted in terms of existence of noncovalent complexes resistant to dissociation by mild detergents and consisting of the 80-kDa glycoprotein, CD59 and CD55 glycoproteins, relatively tightly bound (glyco)lipids and possibly other so far unidentified components. These complexes contain probably also other glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked Ag, as an anti-CD48 mAb immunoprecipitated also an apparently very similar complex. The complexes immunoprecipitated by mAb against the CD55, CD59, and CD48 Ag also contain a protein kinase activity.

Although the cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), has been shown to recruit monocytes and promote the inflammatory process, its effects on neutrophils are unknown. In this investigation, [125I]TGF-beta 1 affinity binding studies were employed to show that neutrophils express TGF-beta receptors (350 +/- 20 receptors/cell), which exhibit high affinity for the ligand (dissociation constant, 50 pM). Affinity cross-linking studies identified the receptors to be primarily of the type I class. In contrast to the receptors on monocytes, neutrophil TGF-beta receptors were not down-regulated by exposure to specific inflammatory mediators. Additional studies examined whether exposure of neutrophils to TGF-beta could enhance specific functions, as occurs with monocytes. TGF-beta was shown to cause directed migration of neutrophils at femtomolar concentrations, thus it is the most potent neutrophil chemotactic factor yet identified. Neutrophil production of reactive oxygen intermediates was not stimulated by TGF-beta, nor did TGF-beta enhance or depress subsequent PMA- or FMLP-stimulated superoxide production. However, the stable expression of neutrophil TGF-beta receptors, and the capacity of this cytokine to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis, suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of TGF-beta are mediated by neutrophils in addition to monocytes.\r"

Rats were fed an alpha-linolenic acid-rich (perilla oil) diet or a linoleic acid-rich (safflower oil) diet for 6 wk, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were elicited by peritoneal injection of casein. The overall phospholipid content and composition as well as the subclass distribution of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids in PMN were not altered by these diets. However, with the perilla oil diet their content of a putative precursor of PAF, 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was approximately 50% of that with safflower oil diet. On exposure to various concentrations of FMLP, PAF formation by PMN in the perilla oil group was less than 50% of that by PMN in the safflower oil group. A larger difference in PAF productions by PMN in the two dietary groups was observed on their stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187. These results demonstrate that PAF production is modulated in some as yet unknown way by changing the alpha-linolenate/linoleate balance of the diet.\r"

It has recently been recognized that members of the stress protein family are synthesized constitutively and subserve functions that are critical to protein folding during intracellular transport. In this study we examined the expression of heat shock/stress proteins in human mononuclear phagocytes, cells dependent on intracellular transport for Ag processing, Ag presentation, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, and secretion of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory polypeptides. The results indicate that there are distinct patterns in expression of individual members of the highly homologous SP70, SP90, and ubiquitin gene families during different stress states. There is a marked increase in expression of the heat-inducible form of SP70 and SP90 in human monocytes during heat shock. Expression of GRP 78/BiP and GRP 94 increases predominantly during glucose starvation but also increases during heat shock. Ubiquitin gene expression increases during both heat shock and glucose starvation. There is no change in synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 or of the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 during heat shock or glucose starvation. Synthesis of the constitutive form of SP 70 and novel SP 90-like polypeptides increase during endotoxin-mediated inflammatory activation. One intracellular transport process of the mononuclear phagocyte, secretion of specific proinflammatory and antiinflammatory polypeptides, is affected by glucose starvation and by heat shock.\r"

  ".U": "91349585\r", 
  ".W": "As part of an ongoing investigation of human mast cell heterogeneity, we have isolated, partially purified, and characterized the uterine mast cell and compared it with mast cells isolated from other organs. The average histamine content of myometrium and leiomyofibroma obtained from hysterectomies was 2.1 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SEM) microgram/g of tissue (n = 10), and the histamine content of the two tissues did not differ significantly. A mild collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNase digestion was used to disperse the uterine mast cells, with an average yield of 9.5% (range, 0 to 21%). The average histamine/uterine mast cell was 2.1 +/- 0.2 pg (n = 3), and 61 +/- 7% (n= 3) of the uterine mast cells survived overnight culture. Early purification efforts with Percoll gradients have yielded up to 80% pure uterine mast cells, with an average of 27 +/- 10% (n = 5). Uterine mast cells released histamine in response to the secretogogues anti-IgE and A23187 but did not respond to substance P or to the basophil secretogogues FMLP, C5a, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. After 1 microgram/ml anti-IgE stimulation, the uterine mast cell appeared to make significant quantities of PGD2 (89 +/- 26 ng/10(6) cells, n = 6) (p less than 0.05), as assayed by RIA. Simultaneously, leukotriene C4 release was 45 +/- 15 ng/10(6) cells, (n = 6) (p less than 0.05), as assayed by RIA. Combined gas-chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis of anti-IgE-stimulated cell supernatants confirmed the production of PGD2. In pharmacologic studies, isobutyl-methylxanthine and isoproterenol blocked anti-IgE-induced histamine release. The uterine mast cell is similar to the lung mast cell in terms of response to secretogogues and release of arachidonic acid metabolites. Ultrastructurally, the uterine mast cell contains scroll granules, crystal granules, combined granules, homogeneously dense granules, and large lipid bodies, many with focal lucencies within them. Particle granules, most frequently present in gut mast cells of mucosal origin, were absent from uterine mast cells. Although certain features are analogous to the ultrastructure of skin or lung mast cells, the combination of structures is distinctive for uterine mast cells.\r"

We have previously shown that 50% of the neutrophil influx during immune complex peritonitis in mice is due to mast cells. Eicosanoids are important mediators of various inflammatory processes including neutrophil infiltration. The possibility that mast cells are essential for the production of leukotrienes (LT) involved in the elicitation of neutrophils in immune complex peritonitis was investigated in mast cell-deficient, WBB6F1-W/WV, and normal, WBB6F(1-)+/+, mice. The time course and amounts of immunoreactive PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and TX3B2 released into the peritoneal exudates were similar in both sets of mice. LTB4 and LTC4 levels, however, were twofold higher in +/+ than in W/WV mice 2 h after stimulation. HPLC analysis of the peritoneal exudate confirmed the presence of leukotrienes. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 blocked leukotriene production in a dose-dependent manner in both sets of mice. However, this compound caused a significant reduction (60%) of neutrophil infiltration only in WBB6F(1-)+/+ but not in the mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/WV mice restored the effect of A-63162 on PMN recruitment. These data suggest that mast cells in the vicinity of blood vessels are important for the synthesis of leukotrienes responsible for PMN recruitment.\r"

We report here the effects of the L-arginine-dependent pathway of activated mouse macrophages (MO) on the obligate intracellular prokaryote, Mycobacterium leprae. Due to the inability to culture M. leprae in vitro, a simple, quantitative assay was employed to measure the metabolism/viability of M. leprae released from MO: the metabolic capacity of M. leprae to oxidize 14C-palmitic acid to 14CO2. Murine normal MO or MO activated in vitro with IFN-gamma or in vivo by injection with Corynebacterium parvum were infected with viable M. leprae freshly harvested from the footpads of nu/nu mice. Activated MO strikingly inhibited the metabolism of M. leprae; however, in L-arginine-free medium or in medium containing L-arginase, the inhibitory effects of activated MO on M. leprae metabolism were abolished. The competitive inhibitor of L-arginine, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, also blocked the inhibitory effects of activated MO for M. leprae, but the addition of supplemental L-arginine overcame the NG-monomethyl-L-arginine-induced block. Furthermore, in the culture supernatants, the levels of NO2-, an end product of L-arginine degradation, were directly proportional to the ability of the activated MO to inhibit M. leprae metabolism. These data present five lines of evidence that suggest that activated MO utilize the L-arginine-dependent pathway to cope with M. leprae.\r"

Mice were immunized s.c. with: 1) purified recombinant NP with three different adjuvants--alum, saponin, or CFA; 2) whole inactivated A/Okuda virus in PBS or saponin; or 3) live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium AroA- vector expressing NP. A series of overlapping synthetic peptides that cover more than 90% of the amino acid sequence of NP were used to map the Th cell epitopes. The results showed that the same limited number of major epitopes were recognized after each of the different immunization regimes. Secondary in vivo boosting using the same vehicles as for the primary immunization did not increase the number of different T cell sites recognized. The T cell responses after intranasal infection with infectious A/NT/60/68 or A/PR/8/34 virus also showed a similar pattern of recognition of the major CD4-positive T cell epitopes. The only exception was that the region corresponding to residues 401-419 was only recognized after exposure to NP from A/NT/60/68 but not A/PR/8/34. This is probably because the two viruses differ in amino acid sequence at positions 408 and 411 within this part of the NP molecule. In contrast to the results observed with CD4-positive T cell epitopes, the major determinant recognized by CD8-positive T cells was only presented after live viral infection. The results in this study have important implications for vaccine design, inasmuch as they indicate that the same dominant CD4 T cell determinants on NP presented by vaccination with NP are also recognized by T cells from mice exposed to infectious virus.\r"

We have analyzed the protein-binding characteristics and enhancer activity of four kappa B-like enhancers and of a MHC class II-like Y box found in the mouse TNF-alpha promoter. In addition to members of the NF-kappa B/rel transcription factor family, at least two of the kappa B sites also bound a nuclear protein identified as NF-GMa, a factor that binds to promoter sequences from many cytokines. When inserted upstream of an enhancer-less promoter, two of the kappa B sites were active as LPS-inducible enhancers in primary macrophages, whereas the other two were not. Mutations in nucleotides known to contact nuclear factors severely reduced affinity of the kappa B sites for NF-kappa B. Introduction of the same mutations into a construct containing 1059 bp of the TNF-alpha promoter coupled to a CAT reporter gene resulted in a stepwise reduction in inducibility by LPS; mutation of all four sites (11 bp of 1059) reduced inducibility by 90%, providing compelling evidence for the role of transcription factors belonging to the NF-kappa B/rel family in the activation of the TNF-alpha promoter. The TNF-alpha Y box bound an abundant nuclear factor, but had no detectable activity in our assays, either as an enhancer or as a mutation-sensitive controlling element.\r"

Recently, a 30-kDa protein highly expressed on rat NK cells and capable of mediating transmembrane signaling was identified and the gene coding for it cloned and sequenced. To better understand the role of this protein in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we cloned its mouse homologue by cross-hybridization of the rat gene to a cDNA library generated from highly purified mouse lymphokine-activated NK cells. Three messages, differing in size and sequence and encoded by different genes, are specifically cotranscribed in mouse NK cells. The protein products of this gene family express the lectin-like motif characteristic of type II transmembrane molecules. Both the rat and mouse proteins have conserved tyrosine and serine residues in their cytoplasmatic portion that are potential phosphorylation sites. They also share a sequence that could be the binding site of the P56lck tyrosine kinase. These observations are consistent with the signaling function hypothesized for these proteins.\r"

METHODS. A clinical trial was conducted to assess the plasma lipids response and adherence to the AHA diet in 120 men and women with hypercholesterolemia. All subjects were advised to follow the AHA diet for 18 weeks. RESULTS. After 6 weeks of the AHA diet intervention, there were modest but significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol (-2.6%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-3.5%), but no further significant reductions were observed thereafter. Rather, there was a tendency to return to and even exceed baseline levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol over the subsequent 12 weeks, in spite of the subjects' reported continued adherence to the AHA diet and maintenance of weight loss throughout the entire study period. Nevertheless, 51% of the subjects had experienced improvement (-0.2% to -26.3%) in their plasma LDL cholesterol levels by the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS. A probable reason for the limited response of the diet was low baseline levels in intake of saturated fat and cholesterol by participants. The subjects who were older and had higher levels of plasma LDL cholesterol and total fat intake at baseline experienced better plasma LDL cholesterol response to the AHA diet. Thus, practicing physicians should consider assessing the baseline dietary fat and cholesterol intake of patients with hypercholesterolemia before starting the AHA diet, since patients may already be following a relatively prudent self-selected diet. Additional dietary gains in lipid management might well require a more severe restriction of dietary fats and cholesterol. Long-term efficacy of the AHA diet should also be evaluated clinically with periodic lipid profiles.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Depression is a common illness in family practice and is frequently missed by busy practitioners. Recent studies have suggested a relationship between smoking and depression in the general population. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a patient's smoking is related to the physician's recognition of a patient's depression. If so, smoking may serve as a cue used by physicians to recognize depression in their clinical decision-making process. METHODS. Adult patients presenting to the University of Oklahoma Family Practice Residency Clinic were screened for depression using the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). After each patient visit, upper level residents or fellows completed response cards on which they recorded their assessment of the likelihood of a depression, their familiarity with the patient, and whether they had any knowledge of a depression history. RESULTS. The prevalence of depression as measured by the BDI among smokers (n = 232) and nonsmokers (n = 472) was 24.1% and 15.3%, respectively, a significant difference (P less than .001). Physicians identified depression at a significantly higher rate (75.0%) among depressed smokers than among depressed nonsmokers (48.6%) (P less than .0001). Smokers were 2.06 times as likely to be labeled depressed when controlling for the presence of a current depression, physician knowledge of a depression history, and physician familiarity with the patient (P less than .0001, 95% CI = 1.44,2.94). CONCLUSIONS. Smoking may serve as a cue for the clinician in the recognition of depression. Further research is needed to determine how smoking or a related factor may be used by physicians to correctly identify depression.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Given the current health promotion efforts regarding coronary artery disease, more information is needed about residents' attitudes and behaviors that relate to identification and management of patients with elevated serum cholesterol levels. METHODS. Family practice residents from eight US programs (N = 128) were surveyed in 1989 to assess their attitudes and reported practice patterns. Resident survey data were compared, when feasible, to published data from 1986 and 1990 surveys of practicing physicians performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS. The use of faculty \"key contacts\" resulted in a 90% response rate (N = 115). Both residents and practicing physicians attributed a high degree of importance to cholesterol as a risk factor. Residents reported more frequent routine screening of middle-aged men than the routine screening rate of practicing physicians in 1986 (P less than .01). Residents reported less frequent screening of younger and older adults than of middle-aged men (P less than .001). Residents' threshold for the use of cholesterol-lowering medication was lower than that of practicing physicians surveyed in 1986, but higher than that of physicians surveyed in 1990. Compared with practicing physicians, residents did not believe they were as well prepared to counsel patients about dietary change or as successful when they tried to help patients make changes; residents reported a significantly higher rate of referral to dietitians (P less than .01). CONCLUSIONS. Residents may need more education regarding screening guidelines for children and young adults. A health promotion skills gap may exist that explains reported discrepancies between self-report and actual behavior and indicates that residency educators may need to pay more attention to fostering dietary assessment and counseling skills in their residents.\r"

The prothrombin time (PT) test, which is the most common coagulation test used in the outpatient setting, has not been recommended for office laboratory use because it has been technically difficult to perform. Consequently, serious errors in patient care could occur because of an erroneous result. The Coumatrak (E.I. Du Pont, Wilmington, Del) now allows nontechnically trained office staff to perform PT tests using a fresh capillary whole blood sample, individually packaged reagent cartridges, and a portable battery-operated instrument. METHODS. Coumatrak PT testing was compared with standard methods for both precision and accuracy, using protocols developed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Reagent stability and operator variability were also studied. RESULTS. The results produced by a trained technologist and nontechnically trained staff were comparable. Test results obtained with the Coumatrak were approximately 10% higher than results obtained using standard laboratory equipment and methods using comparable blood samples from the same patients. It was found that the capillary blood specimen had to be rapidly transferred to the reagent cartridge in order to avoid factitiously low results. CONCLUSIONS. The Coumatrak can rapidly provide PT test results that are clinically useful for the office management of patients being treated with a warfarin anticoagulant and for the diagnosis of selected disorders. The system was found to be easy to operate, appropriate for use by individuals with little laboratory experience, and was subject to few operational problems during this study.\r"

Based on a list of drugs (input), drug interactions programs search their databases for possible interactions between each drug pair in the input list. An output list specifies pairs of drugs that potentially interact. Since each program uses its own information database, results may differ slightly among programs. In general, however, the screen menus, appearance of the programs, and the \"extras\" included in each program differ more than the programs' drug interactions output. The software programs tested are all easy to use. Each of the three drug interactions programs reviewed has unique features that may appeal to certain users. The Medical Letter Drug Interactions Program is the least costly and provides the most academic output, allowing users to view citations for each specific interaction. The PDR Drug Interactions and Side Effects software includes a side effects index that allows either searching of a drug, which produces a list of the drug's side effects, or searching of a specific side effect, which produces a list of drugs associated with that side effect. Drug Interactions III is the only program that allows users to add drug interactions to its database.\r"

The aim was to discover if clinicians could manage patients with MRI alone, or if they would find a second investigation necessary. Eighty two patients were managed using MRI alone, 34 of whom were treated surgically. Twenty patients had a second investigation: a myelogram in 18 and a CT myelogram in two. This was performed in nine patients to exclude structural pathology in the thoracic or lumbar region (which was not examined with MRI), and in 11 to obtain more specific information about the cervical region. Only five of these 20 patients had surgical treatment. The diagnosis changed after the second investigation in four patients, but management was not influenced in any of these. MRI is a satisfactory alternative to myelography for most patients with suspected cervical spondylotic myelopathy.\r"

Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain.\r"

Slight weakness of the extensors of the fingers and hands was found in all nine patients, and of the dorsiflexors of the feet in seven. All patients had a distal sensory disturbance most prominent for temperature which agrees with earlier observations. EMG changes in TA and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles were of myopathic type. Slight abnormalities compatible with either myopathy or early neuropathy were found in one muscle biopsy. These findings indicate that a neurogenic lesion affecting at least the peripheral sensory system is present at an early stage of Welander's distal myopathy and that the neurogenic lesion might precede the myopathic changes.\r"

The projection of the corticomotoneuronal pathways was assessed by placing the coil over the vertex and comparing the size of responses in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles evoked by clockwise and anticlockwise coil currents. In normal subjects, right FDI responses are larger with clockwise currents than with anticlockwise currents at the same stimulation strength and vice versa. In two out of three patients with congenital mirror movements, this sensitivity of response amplitude to coil current direction was reversed. The third patient with congenital mirror movements and a fourth patient with acquired mirror movements had responses which were normally sensitive to current direction. These findings support the hypothesis that some cases of congenital mirror movements may be due to abnormal projection of corticomotoneuronal pathways.\r"

One was a plasmacytoma, the other a metastatic deposit from a Ewing's sarcoma. The difficulties in diagnosis of this syndrome are illustrated together with the importance and success of appropriate treatment. From the literature it appears possible that these two tumours may be particularly likely to occlude the SSS and the reasons for this are discussed.\r"

Statistically significant differences included reduction in the heart rate response to standing and in the blood pressure response to sustained handgrip. Latency of the pupillary light reflex was not different from controls but the time to reach peak velocity of contraction was significantly longer in the myotonic dystrophy group. It is argued that these results reflect dysfunction of voluntary and iris smooth muscle rather than autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\r"

To investigate whether alteration of SPLI is related to an autonomic disorder, myelinated fibre counts of the fourth thoracic ventral roots were performed. Eleven of 13 MSA patients showed a significant decrease in small and large myelinated fibres, and were diagnosed with definite Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), with the exception of two who had no apparent history of autonomic dysfunction. SPLIs in laminae I + II in 10 of these 11 patients, when adjusted for age, were significantly decreased at both levels of the fourth thoracic and third lumbar spinal segments. The results suggest the disorder of SP-containing synapses of primary afferent neurons and/or those of interneurons in SDS.\r"

We have monitored renal function and drainage using 99mTc-DTPA renography in 77 children with such kidneys presenting at 1-14 mo of age with the aims of throwing light on the natural history of the condition and evaluating the response of the kidney to pyeloplasty. Since management was independent of the drainage criteria on renography, the opportunity also was presented to evaluate the efficacy of diuretic renography for diagnosing obstruction in these children. Follow-up ranged between 1 and 6 yr, during which renography was performed between 2 and 6 times in each patient. Thirty-nine patients were treated conservatively, while 30 patients underwent pyeloplasty at varying times after presentation. No overall significant change in function was observed either in the nonoperated children or as a result of surgery. This also applied to sub-groups of children with poor drainage. Function improved significantly, however, in a sub-group of nonoperated children who presented with impaired function in the hydronephrotic kidney. Surgery, although having no overall effect on function, significantly improved drainage. As a means of identifying obstruction, 99mTc-DTPA diuretic renography was unreliable, erroneously indicating obstruction in 24 nonoperated children in whom function of the hydronephrotic kidney never became abnormal and who could not, therefore, have been considered to have obstruction. This retrospective study underlines the importance of performing a randomized prospective study on the value of pyeloplasty in this group of children.\r"

Five of seven lesions which had a relatively low FDG uptake before therapy showed no change or increase in tumor size by therapy. The decreased FDG uptake after therapy was more prominent in the partial response group than in the no change group. FDG uptake before therapy in the non-relapse group was higher than that in the relapse group. However, a decreased FDG uptake did not necessarily indicate a good prognosis. One patient with no change in tumor size and a decreased FDG uptake had no recurrence. This suggests that FDG-PET has a complementary role in the assessment of therapeutic effects.\r"

Ten patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis received intraperitoneal injections of the murine monoclonal antibody B72.3 radiolabeled with 131I. Biodistribution studies were performed using nuclear medicine methods until laparotomy at 4-14 days after injection. Surgical biopsies of normal tissues and tumor were obtained. The marrow was predicted to be the critical organ, with maximum tolerated dose [200 rad (2 Gy) to marrow] expected at about 200 mCi (7.4 GBq). In patients with large intraperitoneal tumor deposits, the tumor itself is an important source tissue for radiation exposure to normal tissues. Local \"hot-spots\" for tumor-absorbed dose were observed, with maximum tumor-absorbed dose calculated at 11,000 rad (11 Gy) per 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) administered intraperitoneal; however, tumor rad dose varied considerably. This may pose serious problems for curative therapy, especially in patients with large tumor burdens.\r"

In addition, profiles of the activity distribution along the length of the colon were generated and the mean position of the activity in the colon calculated. For all indices, the results were similar in both normal subjects and constipated patients when comparing tracers, although marked differences were present between normal subjects and constipated patients for each tracer. Indium-111-DTPA was easy to administer and dosimetry was more acceptable than for 131I-cellulose, especially in constipated patients.

In 23 patients, a total of 32 tumor specimens were obtained for histochemical analysis of glutathione (GSH) content using high-pressure liquid chromatography. A significant correlation (least square method, p less than 0.001) between CBIs and GSH values was found, supporting the hypothesis that GSH is the predominant factor for the conversion of the lipophilic complex to hydrophilic derivates.\r"

Fifteen (34%) lesions were seen on both x-ray and SPECT. Seventeen (39%) lesions were seen only on SPECT. Twelve (27%) of the lesions were seen on x-ray tomography only. Of the lesions seen on x-ray tomography but not on SPECT, two were subarachnoid hemorrhage, two were thin subdural hematomas, and eight were contusions. This study shows that SPECT can detect focal disturbances of cerebral blood flow that are not seen on x-ray tomography. It also suggests that there are two types of contusions: those with a decreased cerebral blood flow (i.e., detectable on SPECT) and those with a cerebral blood flow equal to that of the surrounding brain.\r"

Both quantified temporal lobe asymmetry and blinded visual detection of temporal lobe hypoperfusion were employed. Visual analysis detected ipsilateral hypoperfusion in 18 (39%) of the 46 patients with a unilateral focus and contralateral hypoperfusion in 3. None of the five patients with bitemporal foci had unilateral hypoperfusion. The positive predictive value of unilateral temporal lobe hypoperfusion was 86% (18/21). Quantified anterior temporal lobe asymmetry, greater than a previously derived normal range, correctly identified the focus in 22 (48%) but gave the wrong side in 5, resulting in a predictive value of 81%. The degree of asymmetry correlated inversely with age of seizure onset, but not with other clinical parameters, histology, or verbal and nonverbal memory. The usefulness of interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT for pre-operative seizure focus localization is limited by low sensitivity when performed with a conventional rotating gamma camera. This suggests that ictal or immediate postictal imaging may be necessary for this purpose.\r"

This study of renal clearance has compared two fundamentally different gamma camera techniques (both of which require a single blood sample) with the multiple blood sampling technique in children (n = 30). Results show that a 40-min dynamic 99mTc-MAG3 renal scintigram coupled with a single plasma sample will allow analysis of the data so that clearance values, which are similar to those from multiple plasma samples, may be calculated. The curve generated from the cardiac region of interest (ROI) provided clearances values that had a high correlation coefficient (0.939-0.951) compared to the multiple-plasma sample technique immaterial of the timing of the blood sample. The renal uptake method of clearance had a lower correlation coefficient (0.89-0.92), which varied with the timing of the blood sample compared to the multiple-plasma sampling technique. This study has demonstrated that an extended gamma camera acquisition coupled with a single-plasma sample may be used for quantitative renal function studies using 99mTc-MAG3.\r"

In one study, however, proteinuria seemed to influence the MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio. In order to establish whether proteinuria or serum albumin level has influence on this ratio, a comparison was made between 99mTc-MAG3 clearance and 131I-hippurate clearance in 14 patients. There was a good linear correlation between MAG3 and hippurate clearance, although the standard error of estimate of ERPF from MAG3 was relatively large, which remained unexplained. No correlation was found between proteinuria and MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio nor between serum albumin level, GFR, FF, ERPF and the MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio. We therefore conclude that there is no correlation between proteinuria and albumin level and the MAG3/hippurate ratio. A reasonable estimation of ERPF with MAG3 can be made in patients with proteinuria and lowered serum albumin levels although the estimation may be less accurate.\r"

The utility of serial bone scans in combination with PSA levels is retrospectively reviewed in 118 men treated by radical prostatectomy for clinical Stage A or B disease who, at the time of surgery, had no evidence of metastatic disease. Of the 118 patients, 75.4% had no abnormality on either test (mean follow-up 32.4 mo), 9.3% demonstrated a detectable or rising PSA level with negative bone scan (mean follow-up 35 mo), and 8.5% exhibited a detectable and or rising PSA level and positive bone scan (mean follow-up 30.7 mo). Follow-up bone scans were read as either positive or indeterminate with undetectable PSA levels in 6.8% of patients (mean follow-up 27.3 mo). Critical review of the equivocal studies suggests that postoperative PSA levels more truly represent the clinical situation than bone scans. Following radical prostatectomy, routine bone scintigraphy provides little additional information when PSA levels are negative. If PSA becomes detectable or the patient develops symptoms, bone scintigraphy should then be performed.\r"

In 51 regions with severe asynergy, the percent 201Tl uptake was calculated as the ratio of counts on the segment with asynergy to the maximum counts on the normal segment. Eleven of 14 regions with resting 201Tl redistribution (Group 1) had improved wall motion after revascularization. However, 14 of 37 regions without redistribution also improved (Group 2). Twenty-three regions without redistribution or improved wall motion after revascularization (Group 3) had lower regional 201Tl uptake on their delayed images than those in Groups 1 and 2. Moreover, the initial regional uptake of Group 2 was higher than that of Group 3. These results suggest that redistribution on rest-injected 201Tl scans indicates reversibility of severely asynergic myocardium and that high 201Tl uptake in regions without redistribution may predict improvement in wall motion after revascularization. We conclude that 201Tl uptake may be useful as a marker of viability of severe asynergic regions before revascularization.\r"

The synthesis time was 1 hr with an average radiochemical yield (EOS) of 12% and a specific activity of greater than 300 Ci/mmol. In vivo biodistribution in rats at 30 min after administration showed high uptakes into organs known to have high ACE concentration (lung, kidney and aorta) and faster clearance of 18FCAP for lung and kidney, compared to the clearance from the aorta. When different amounts of unlabeled 4-cis-fluorocaptopril (SQ 25750) were coinjected in rats, a dose of greater than 5 micrograms/kg decreased the lung uptake by one-half while only 1 microgram/kg decreased the kidney uptake by one-half. In general, the binding in the four tissues studied was saturable with the expected capacity. 18FCAP was administered to a human and displaceable uptake observed in the lung and kidney. The results demonstrate the feasibility of probing ACE in vivo using PET.\r"

Sensitivity analysis by computer simulation, however, indicated that this method may be subject to increasing error as CMRO2 decreases. Accuracy of the method under pathologic conditions of reduced CMRO2 has not been determined. Since reduced CMRO2 values are observed frequently in newborn infants and in regions of ischemia and infarction in adults, we determined the accuracy of the brief inhalation method in non-human primates by comparing OEF measured with PET to OEF measured by arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-VO2) under pathologic conditions of reduced CMRO2 (0.27-2.68 ml 100g-1 min-1). A regression equation of OEF (PET) = 1.07 x OEF (A-VO2) + 0.017 (r = 0.99, n = 12) was obtained. The absolute error in oxygen extraction measured with PET was small (mean 0.03 +/- 0.04, range -0.03 to 0.12) and was independent of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, CMRO2, or OEF. The percent error was higher (19 +/- 37), particularly when OEF is below 0.15. These data indicate that the brief inhalation method can be used for measurement of cerebral oxygen extraction and cerebral oxygen metabolism under pathologic conditions of reduced cerebral oxygen metabolism, with these limitations borne in mind.\r"

  ".W": "Iodine-123-labeled Ro 16-0154 is a high affinity, reversibly binding radiotracer for the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor. Brain uptake of this radioligand was relatively stable and showed high ratios of specific-to-nonspecific uptake, with greater than 90% displaced by intravenous administration of BZ receptor agents. Repeated injections of increasing doses of each of five BZ drugs (Ro 16-0154, Ro 15-1788, clonazepam, alprazolam, and diazepam) yielded stepwise displacement curves, which were analyzed to measure the in vivo potencies of these agents. The relatively long half-life of 123I and the stable biologic uptake of the radiotracer allowed such potency estimations in just one experiment following a single injection of radioligand. The in vivo potencies of these five agents were highly correlated with their affinities for the BZ receptor determined with in vitro homogenate binding. A single crystal probe provided potency measurements virtually identical to simultaneously performed SPECT imaging studies. In conclusion, stepwise displacement by agents administered following the injection of the radioligand 123I-Ro 16-0154 provided a reliable means of measuring the in vivo potencies of BZ receptor agents. This in vivo determination may predict the clinical potency of BZ drugs than in vitro homogenate estimations, because the in vivo measure provides the summed effects of receptor affinity, plasma protein binding, penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolism of the displacing agent.\r"

  ".W": "1-(5-Iodo-5-deoxy-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole (IAZA) has been synthesised and labeled with 125I. Radioiodinated IAZA was shown to undergo hypoxia-dependent binding in EMT-6 cells in vitro and to have an initial binding rate of 284 pmole/10(6) cells/hr at a substrate concentration of 30 microM. This binding rate is more than three times that of the reference compound, misonidazole (89 pmole/10(6) cells/hr). The elevated binding rate was accompanied by in vitro cytotoxicity 30-40 times greater than that observed for misonidazole. Whole-body elimination and biodistribution studies in BALB/c mice bearing implanted, subcutaneous EMT-6 tumors showed a rapid excretion (greater than 98% in 24 hr) with moderate tissue levels which, in general, declined as a function of blood clearance. Tumor-to-blood ratios of 4.6 (4 hr) and 8.7 (8 hr), with respective tumor uptake values of 2.08% and 1.22% ID/g of tissue, form a rational basis for evaluation of this and related 2-nitroimidazole analogs as radiopharmaceuticals suitable for scintigraphic evaluation of tissue (tumor) hypoxia.\r"

The most common clinical example of the artifacts which result from this is encountered when sections are taken through the femoral heads in skeletal studies of the pelvis. From some simple phantom studies, it was identified that the count losses were associated with the presence of a high dynamic range in the projection data. Further information was obtained from simulation studies. It was found that the count loss phenomenon is caused by the combined effects of the presence of a high count density area and a structure with a relatively high attenuation level. An appreciation of the presence, magnitude, and mechanism of this effect is important if erroneous clinical findings are to be avoided. This is particularly relevant because of the existence of a variety of techniques that can be used to remove the resulting artifacts.\r"

On a midventricular transverse slice and on a midventricular sagittal slice, the apical and basal limits are selected successively by the operator. The linear activity profiles between these two limits are plotted line by line. In each profile, the two points with the maximum counts in the septal and lateral walls on the transverse slice, or in the anterior and inferior walls on the sagittal slice, are detected. The intermediate point with the minimum counts is then determined. The set of points with minimum counts are fitted by a straight line using the least squares method. This line is taken as the LV long-axis. In a series of 15 cases with stress-delayed 201Tl SPECT, the reproducibility of the reorientation with this semi-automatic method was compared with manual selection of the LV long-axis. In all patients, a successful reorientation was obtained with the present method. The reproducibility was significantly better with the semi-automatic method than with the manual selection of the LV long-axis.\r"

Despite this practical experience, however, comparison of these methods generally has been confined to procedural differences that do not reflect the intrinsic properties of the methods. Here, we describe the results of a simple theoretical calculation from first principles that compares the methods based on their relative statistical precision. This analysis assumes that each procedure is carried out with the same tracer dose in the same hypothetical patient under identical conditions and with the same ideal imaging equipment. Results obtained with this model suggest that the imaging time required for a gated equilibrium study to achieve the same statistical precision as a first-pass study is typically less than 2 min in resting subjects and less than 1 min during stress. The analysis also indicates that gated equilibrium studies will tend to possess the greater statistical precision when cardiac output is elevated, such as when the heart is imaged during exercise. On the other hand, this analysis indicates that the first-pass method will tend to possess the greater precision when cardiac output is low and when imaging time is highly constrained.\r"

The difference between this curve and the observed lung curve is then used to calculate QP/QS. This method was evaluated on a set of simulated lung time-activity curves with precisely known QP/QS values on a group of 11 patients with no clinical suspicion of cardiac shunt and on a group of 30 patients referred for cardiac shunt studies. The QP/QS in each of these studies was determined by three individuals using both the Maltz-Treves method and the new method. This method yielded QP/QS values that were more accurate on the simulated lung data and had less interobserver variation on all the studies than those obtained from the Maltz-Treves method.\r"

CB-CT was implemented on a rotating gamma camera with a point source (1-2 mCi) of 99mTc, and a light-weight aluminum source holder. A cone-beam collimator may be used but is not required. Since the point source is either located at the collimator focal point, or the camera is uncollimated, CB-CT has excellent sensitivity (at least 150 times that of a parallel-hole, high-resolution collimator). The predicted resolution is equal to the intrinsic gamma camera resolution (3-4 mm), which is much higher than for a high-resolution, parallel-hole collimator (10-20 mm). In the present study, CB-CT provided low noise, high-resolution attenuation maps for use in a nonuniform attenuation-weighted backprojection algorithm. The attenuation compensation accuracy was tested using basic geometries of line sources and nonuniform density models. For the appropriate scaling of the attenuation map, the attenuation compensation was accurate and removed the SPECT image distortion associated with nonuniform attenuation. Attenuation maps acquired either with cone beam collimator or without any collimator were both successful. Using CB-CT, SPECT can thus be made much more accurate without adding unduly to the imaging time, complexity, or cost.\r"

While the medical risks entailed in drawing multiple samples may be negligible, the problems of parental and institutional consent make such studies more difficult in the pediatric population. Scaling for patient size permits combining data from patients of different age and limits the number of studies required. A scaling technique is presented and evaluated here. With scaling, adult data can be used successfully to predict pediatric responses and to develop pediatric methods based on adult data alone. Inclusion of pediatric data improves the fit and permits development of generic methods that work with both adults and children.\r"

Enzymes studied were: acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT); acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (MGAT) and acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Results showed that after a 4-wk feeding period, ACAT, ACLAT and DGAT basal activities were significantly enhanced by the dietary fatty acids of the (n-3) series, whereas MGAT activity was not affected. When the highest (n-6):(n-3) ratio (51.0) was compared with the lowest (0.8), the increase attained was about 58, 76 and 73% for ACAT, ACLAT and DGAT, respectively. Fatty acid composition of microsomal lipids was drastically altered by the diets because (n-3) PUFA replaced the (n-6) series as the dietary (n-6):(n-3) ratio was lowered. These compositional changes could explain the observed modification in the membrane-bound enzyme activities. We suggest that (n-3) PUFA ingestion leads to an enhanced velocity of chylomicron synthesis in rats.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (174 +/- 2 g) were fed diets containing 0.035% cholesterol and 16% fat (wt/wt) from corn oil (CO diet) or from 2% CO plus 14% butterfat (BF diet), beef tallow (BT diet), palm oil (PO diet) or coconut oil (CN diet) for 6 wk. Apparent lipid digestibility was significantly lower with the PO and BT diets vs. the CO, BF and CN diets. Plasma total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in rats fed the PO and BT diets than in rats fed the BF and CN diets but were not different among the PO-, BT- and CO-fed groups. Nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis immunoblot analysis indicated that HDL apo A-I and E resided on particles with significantly smaller modal diameters in rats fed all saturated fats compared with those fed the CO diet. Chemical analyses indicated that HDL generally contained proportionately less protein and more triglyceride, free cholesterol and apo E with saturated fat feeding than with CO diet feeding. Significantly higher plasma and VLDL triglyceride levels were noted with ingestion of the BT, PO or CN diet than with the CO diet. Butterfat feeding resulted in lower plasma triglycerides and HDL-esterified cholesterol than did feeding the other saturated fats. Very low density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations were inversely correlated with HDL modal diameter of apo E containing lipoproteins (P less than 0.005). These data provide further evidence of the interrelationship of triglyceride and HDL metabolism and suggest that mechanisms independent of cholesterol ester transfer protein may mediate this response in rats.\r"

Pups reared by their mother served as controls. In one experiment, D7-cholesterol was fed in the milk at four different concentrations. The purpose of the study was to determine whether cholesterol in milk influenced growth and the sterol composition of brain over the period of its most rapid accumulation in this organ. We found that body and brain weights were not different, irrespective of the concentration of cholesterol in the milk substitutes. High concentrations of cholesterol in milk caused a significant increase in cholesterol in liver and plasma, whereas the concentration of cholesterol in brain was not different from the concentration in the brain of controls. The amounts of D7-cholesterol in lung and liver, and in plasma and RBC that pass the brain, were consistent with the concentration fed in the milk and approached 70% of the total content of cholesterol in these organs at the highest concentration fed. Brain, by contrast, contained very small amounts of D7-cholesterol, which could readily be attributed to D7-cholesterol associated with the vascular system of the blood-brain barrier. We found that the sterol composition of brain is not influenced by the concentration of cholesterol in milk and that cholesterol exogenous to brain, even in a hypercholesterolemic condition, does not gain entry to the brain. We conclude that the brain biosynthesizes de novo all the cholesterol it requires.\r"

  ".W": "In a 16-wk study, weanling Wistar rats (32 males and 32 females) were fed a modified AIN-76 diet containing 20% fat with various (n-3) fatty acids. All dietary fats provided the same amount of saturates, monounsaturates, and total essential fatty acids [(n-6) + (n-3)]. The control diet contained lard/corn oil (L/CO). The other diets contained (n-3) fatty acids from linseed oil (LSO), from linseed oil + menhaden oil (LSO + MO) or from menhaden oil (MO). The (n-3) diets reduced total and HDL-cholesterol, particularly in rats fed the MO diet. Platelet thromboxane levels were equally depressed by the LSO and MO diets. Dietary (n-3) fatty acids significantly elevated docosahexaenoic acid in livers and hearts of male and female rats, with females reaching higher levels. This increase was accompanied by reduced arachidonic acid, except for hearts of females in which the major decrease was in linoleic acid. Overall, enzyme activities in the MO-fed group were decreased to the following levels (relative to the activity in the control group): heart Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD), 28%; liver CuZnSOD, 82%; aorta CuZnSOD, 32%. Greater reductions in these enzyme activities were seen in the female rats fed the MO diet compared with male rats. Lipid peroxidation, assessed by urinary, heart and liver thiobarbituric acid reactants, was increased by dietary (n-3) fatty acids (MO greater than LSO + MO greater than LSO greater than L/CO) and was higher in females than in males. These results indicate that enhanced lipid peroxidation occurs with the increased oxidative stress of elevated tissue (n-3) fatty acids accompanied by reduced SOD activity.\r"

Each sheep was intramuscularly injected with 120 pmol.d-1.kg body wt-1 of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol during the last 7 d of each dietary period. Approximately 100 mg of bone powder was implanted on the abdominal muscle on d 21 and d 28 of each dietary period. Plaques induced by the bone powder were harvested 12 d after the implantation. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TR-ACP) activity was lower and the number of multinucleated cells was smaller in plaques of animals during the protein-deficient period than during the control period. The administration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol increased the activity of TR-ACP and the number of multinucleated cells during both dietary treatments. However, TR-ACP activity was still lower and the cell number was still smaller during the protein-deficient period than during the control period when they were injected with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. These results suggest that protein deficiency reduces the activity of osteoclastic cell induction. The suppressive effect of protein deficiency on the induction and the activity of osteoclastic cells is not related to the action of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.\r"

The liver cholesterol concentration in the rice bran-fed group was the lowest of the six diet groups and was significantly different than concentrations in the oat bran-fed group and the barley bran-fed group (P less than 0.05). The oat bran, mixed bran, and barley bran did not significantly lower blood cholesterol in the mice. Both the soybean fiber and rice bran diet groups had significantly lower total blood cholesterol than did the fiber-free controls (P less than 0.05).

Controls were fed an identical diet supplemented with 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride/kg diet. Glutathione concentrations in each organ examined were similar in control and vitamin B-6-deficient rats, and the values were comparably lower after intraperitoneal injection of diethylmaleate. However, buthionine sulfoximine caused a significantly greater decrease in glutathione levels in the liver and lungs of vitamin B-6-deficient rats relative to controls. Glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver of vitamin B-6-deficient rats was higher than in control animals; however, glutathione transferase activity in tissues other than liver of vitamin B-6-deficient rats was higher than in the controls. The activities of gamma-glutamyl-transferase in the liver and spleen of vitamin B-6-deficient rats were significantly lower than control values. The holoenzyme activities of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase in the liver of vitamin B-6-deficient rats were markedly reduced. These findings indicate that although the activities of enzymes that synthesize cysteine from methionine were decreased by vitamin B-6 deficiency, the level of synthesis and supply of cysteine in vitamin B-6-deficient rats were sufficient to maintain the same glutathione level as in controls, and that glutathione utilization in the liver was accelerated by vitamin B-6 deficiency.\r"

The isonitrogenous diets were carefully balanced for the different mineral concentrations in the protein preparations. Absolute and percent magnesium absorption and urinary magnesium excretion were significantly decreased in rats fed soybean protein when compared with casein, irrespective of the dietary concentration of added magnesium. The magnesium content of femur was significantly lower in rats fed soybean protein, but this effect was seen only when the diet contained 0.82 mmol magnesium/100 g diet. The addition of sodium phytate to the casein diets, to a concentration identical to that in the diets containing soybean protein as provided by the soybean protein preparation, produced similar effects on magnesium absorption as the diets containing soybean protein. These results indicate that soybean protein, when compared with casein, decreases magnesium absorption through its phytate component.\r"

It made no difference whether the anions were ingested as sodium or potassium salts. In Study 1, 80% of the variation in urinary calcium excretion could be explained on the basis of urinary excretion of sulfate, ammonia and total anions.

Intestinal metallothionein mRNA and metallothionein protein were not affected by dexamethasone or interleukin 1 alpha, but were markedly increased by parenteral zinc. Absorption of 65Zn from isolated duodenal segments was inversely related to intestinal metallothionein concentration in rats given zinc, but was not affected by dexamethasone or interleukin 1 alpha. Plasma zinc concentrations decreased in rats given dexamethasone or interleukin 1 alpha and increased in those given zinc, but they were not related to 65Zn absorption. Similarly, multiple intraperitoneal administration of either dexamethasone or interleukin 1 alpha, or oral administration of dexamethasone, for 7 d markedly increased liver metallothionein synthesis but did not affect intestinal metallothionein concentration or 65Zn absorption.

Intercepts of equations relating energy gain to metabolizable energy intake were different (P less than 0.002) for rats fed diets that contained 10 and 20% casein, so that metabolizable energy for maintenance was 118 and 108 kJ/day, respectively. Surprisingly, in view of the supposedly greater efficiency of lipid deposition, energetic efficiency above maintenance was constant at 0.38 +/- 0.02. Part of the reason is that composition of body gain was much less rigidly tied to daily energy intake--even across the wide range of data in this experiment--than is necessary to quantify reliably such an effect. Two methods of quantifying partial energetic efficiencies of protein and lipid deposition gave results that were comparable to previous estimates of about one-third and two-thirds, respectively. One of the methods used a more biological model but failed to fit data for rats fed the 10% casein diet. Because traditional statistical methods are unlikely to be extended much further to account for the many unsolved problems associated with estimating partial efficiencies, systems based at tissue and cellular levels are necessary to model detailed differences in energy utilization.\r"

Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function.\r"

A 30-d period of suboptimal intake of zinc often caused a 50% decrease in the total number of splenic lymphocytes in young adult mice. One- and two-color flow cytometric analysis was made of the residual splenocytes of the zinc-deficient mice to determine whether the deficiency had also altered the composition or phenotypic distribution of any of the major subsets of T cells or B cells. Marginally zinc-deficient mice had a normal ratio of T cells to B cells with no notable change in the subsets of lymphocytes making up these two classes. Severely zinc-deficient mice that exhibited a significant degree of parakeratosis demonstrated a 20% increase in the overall ratio of T helper to T suppressor/cytotoxic cells as well as a modest decline in the percentage of B cells (5-8%). The latter decrease was not in the B cells bearing immunoglobulin M or D but in the minor subsets bearing other immunoglobulin isotypes. Thus it seems that, whereas zinc deficiency caused significant reductions in the total numbers of splenic lymphocytes, it caused no significant change in the composition of the splenic lymphocytes except in the most severe cases.\r"

Weanling male Fischer 344 rats were given 10 intragastric doses of aflatoxin B1 at a level of 250 micrograms/kg body weight over a 2-wk dosing period (initiation). The subsequent 12-wk period was subdivided into four feeding periods, each lasting 3 wk (promotion). Two groups of rats were fed either a 20 or 5% casein diet during all four periods; additional groups were alternately fed these diets in different sequences. Switching from the high protein diet to a low protein diet (5% casein) resulted in marked remodeling (regression) of the growing lesions to a response level similar to that in animals that did not receive the initial promotional stimulus of high protein feeding. However, refeeding the high protein diet caused significant reappearance of these lesions. The restimulated development of these remodeled lesions far exceeded lesion growth in animals receiving only the late promotional stimulus of high dietary protein. Thus, these data suggest that a second occurrence of high protein feeding promotes the growth of remodeled foci, thus demonstrating their potential for future promotional growth.\r"

  ".W": "Six conditioned Quarter Horse mares were used in a crossover design to assess the effect of the dietary protein level on intramuscular and hepatic glycogen and lactate, oxygen uptake and blood lactate, pyruvate and free fatty acids. After a 2-wk adaptation period to either a 9.0% (control) or an 18.5% crude protein diet, each horse performed an exercise test. The horses were exercised for 15 min on an 11% grade treadmill at 4.5 m/sec. The exercise test was performed 3-4 h after a meal. Venous, arterial and mixed-venous blood samples were taken simultaneously at rest and during exercise. Muscle and liver samples were taken at rest and after exercise. The dietary protein level did not affect hepatic or intramuscular glycogen utilization (P greater than 0.05). Exercise resulted in increased (P less than 0.001) lactate in venous blood, muscle and liver; however, dietary treatment did not affect (P greater than 0.05) lactate level. Venous blood lactate:pyruvate ratio was higher (P less than 0.05) in the control horses. Dietary protein level did not affect (P greater than 0.05) oxygen uptake or plasma free fatty acids; however, exercise increased (P less than 0.01) both. These results indicate the dietary protein did not affect substrate utilization during the absorptive phase of digestion in exercising horses; however, the higher lactate:pyruvate ratio in the control horses suggests that the intraconversion of lactate and pyruvate may be influenced by diet composition.\r"

Both macromolecules bind to the same receptor, termed the VLDL/VTG receptor, localized on the oocyte plasma membrane. Once taken up by the growing zygote, apolipoprotein B, the major protein constituent of VLDL, is proteolytically cleaved by a chicken-specific cathepsin-D. Systemic cholesterol homeostasis in the chicken is maintained by expressing a different apoprotein B-specific receptor in somatic cells, which in terms of its function is very similar to the mammalian LDL receptor. The phenotype of the Restricted Ovulator hen, characterized by hereditary hyperlipidemia and the absence of egg laying, was identified as a lack of expression of functional VLDL/VTG receptors in the oocytes without affecting somatic apoprotein B receptors.\r"

  ".W": "More than thirty-five years have passed since essential fatty acid requirements were demonstrated for poultry. Subsequent studies were conducted to establish a recommended level of linoleic acid for growing poultry. Although a requirement of 1% linoleic acid is suggested, a critical evaluation of the nutritional and metabolic significance of essential fatty acids is lacking. Perhaps alpha-linolenic acid is also essential, but direct evidence is not yet available. Recent literature indicates that several individual fatty acids, including the polyunsaturates derived from essential fatty acids, are biologically active. Furthermore, the numerous eicosanoids biosynthesized from specific polyunsaturates act as either cellular autocrine or paracrine signaling agents. Formation of eicosanoids is ubiquitous in tissues and organs, and these compounds influence nearly all systems in mammalian species. However, although such compounds have been studied extensively in mammalian systems, the formation of polyunsaturates, the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and the biological effects of these compounds have not been intensely studied in domestic poultry.\r"

Concomitant with development of these desirable characteristics is increased abdominal fat deposition and altered body composition. Adipose cellular development in different genetic groups shows that abdominal adipocyte cell number as a proportion of body mass decreases as body size increases, concurrent with increased adiposity. Adipocyte hypertrophy explains a large proportion of the variation in abdominal fat percentage. Growth hormone is correlated with the number and size of abdominal adipocytes across genotype, sex and age. Adipose tissue development and body composition are affected by hormone levels in growing chickens. Possible approaches to modulate fat deposition and adipose cellularity in poultry are reviewed.\r"

Length increments are presented for 2-month intervals from birth to 6 months, and for 3-month intervals from birth to 24 months of age. Weights and lengths at the target ages were obtained for the Iowa data by simple interpolation, and for the Fels data by fitting families of three-parameter mathematical functions to the serial data from ages 1 to 24 months. The tabular presentations are based on the Iowa data from birth to 3 months of age, on the combined Iowa and Fels data from 3 to 6 months of age, and on the Fels data from 6 to 24 months of age.

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a nucleated blood cell count (NucBC) of less than 6/mm3, CSF tests other than bacterial culture need not be performed to exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients not receiving antimicrobial agents. The results of tests performed on the first specimen of CSF obtained for a given hospital visit from children younger than 3 years of age, exclusive of newborn infants admitted to the hospital on their date of birth, were analyzed. Of 3356 CSF specimens evaluated, 122 were from patients with bacterial meningitis; 460 specimens were analyzed separately because the erythrocyte count was greater than 1000/mm3. A negative CSF screening test result was defined as a CSF NucBC less than 6/mm3. In facilitating the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, this screening test had a sensitivity of 98.4%, a specificity of 75.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The other CSF tests varied widely in screening effectiveness: a Gram-stained smear had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the screening relevance of CSF tests. The CSF NucBC and CSF segmented NucBC performed indistinguishably and superiorly compared with the CSF protein or glucose concentration and the ratio of CSF glucose to serum glucose concentration. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NucBC alone is superior to any combination of the other CSF tests. In a prospective study of 215 children younger than 3 years of age undergoing a lumbar puncture in our emergency department, 85% had empiric criteria identifying them as appropriate for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. The CSF NucBC was less than 6/mm3 in 70% of the 181 patients who would have been eligible for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. These data suggest that a strategy for the sequential testing of CSF could be adopted that would exclude unnecessary determinations and thereby save time, effort, and health care dollars.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of vacuoles and toxic granulation in neutrophils can be used as a diagnostic test to help differentiate children with Kawasaki syndrome from those with clinically similar illnesses. DESIGN: Peripheral blood smears of 23 patients with Kawasaki syndrome, 23 disease control patients, and 23 hematology laboratory control subjects were examined in random order by technicians unaware of either the diagnosis or the previously recorded laboratory results. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital in Ottawa, Canada. PATIENTS: All 23 consecutive patients with Kawasaki syndrome satisfied established criteria for the diagnosis. Disease control patients were selected from the hospital registry of patients with other illnesses frequently considered as part of the differential diagnosis for Kawasaki syndrome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with disease control patients, patients with Kawasaki syndrome had a higher percentage of neutrophils with vacuoles (mean +/- SEM, 31% +/- 5% vs 14% +/- 3%; p = 0.006) and toxic granulation (mean +/- SEM, 43% +/- 7% vs 14% +/- 4%; p less than 0.001). If the sum of the number of neutrophils with vacuoles and the number with toxic granulation (per 100 mature neutrophils examined) was at least 70, this \"toxic neutrophil\" test had a specificity of 0.96 and a likelihood ratio of a positive test result of 12. CONCLUSIONS: Degenerative change in neutrophils is common in the early stages of Kawasaki syndrome. The toxic neutrophil test is potentially a helpful adjunct to the clinical examination, particularly in the case of infants and other patients with subtle manifestations who might otherwise be at risk for delayed diagnosis.\r"

All biopsy specimens were examined by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Twenty-five patients (47%) had significant glomerular changes (15 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 4 IgA nephropathy, 3 diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without IgA deposition, and 3 membranous glomerulonephritis), and 28 had minimal glomerular changes. There were no differences between the patients with significant glomerular changes and those with minimal glomerular changes with regard to clinical and laboratory findings except for a predominance of boys in the former group. At the latest follow-up, seven patients with significant glomerular changes, but none with minimal glomerular changes, had chronic renal impairment. Because of the high incidence of significant glomerular changes and the high rate of progression to chronic renal impairment, we believe that a renal biopsy is indicated for a child with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria.\r"

Of 22 children with enteropathic hemolytic-uremic syndrome, 15 (68%) had evidence of VTEC infection by culture of the pathogen or detection of free verotoxin in the feces, or both. Significantly elevated titers of short-lived agglutinins and IgM class antibodies against the 0157 lipopolysaccharide were found in 20 (91%) of 22 patients, but not in two of three patients with non-0157 E. coli isolates or in healthy children or children with diarrhea caused by other enteric pathogens (p less than 0.01). The combined microbiologic and serologic procedures provided evidence for VTEC infection in all 22 patients. The high incidence of anti-0157 lipopolysaccharide antibodies in these patients indicates the predominance and the pathogenic potential of this serogroup. Both serologic techniques proved to be valuable tools to further characterize this form of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Future studies on the induction of protective immunity seem warranted.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the natural history of isolated (i.e., without associated congenital cardiac anomalies) atrial flutter in infancy, we reviewed the clinical course in nine patients who were seen with this arrhythmia in the first year of life (range 1 day to 4 months). Atrial flutter was identified by the typical sawtooth pattern in leads II, III, and aVF of the surface electrocardiogram or the pattern of atrial flutter on an atrial electrogram recorded through the esophagus. The mean cycle length of the atrial flutter was 151 msec (atrial rate 397 beats/min). Six of the nine patients had other perinatal problems, such as immune and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (two patients), pneumonia (one patient), anemia (five patients), or low birth weight (one patient). In all patients the rhythm reverted to normal, either spontaneously (two patients), with overdrive pacing (four patients), or after oral digoxin therapy (three patients). No consistent temporal relationship between digoxin administration and conversion was observed; conversion was instantaneous in the four patients who received atrial overdrive pacing. Four patients were discharged receiving digoxin therapy (6 months to 1 year). One patient had supraventricular tachycardia after discharge that was controlled with digoxin. No recurrence of atrial flutter was observed among the nine patients during a mean follow-up of 6.8 years (range 0.2 to 20 years). We conclude that isolated atrial flutter in infancy is rare, has a good prognosis, may be related to transient perinatal events, and often spontaneously converts to normal sinus rhythm; however, when it does not, it will respond to transesophageal pacing. Acute and chronic digoxin therapy is probably unnecessary.\r"

A deletion could not be demonstrated in either family by G-banded karyotypes or flow cytometric analysis of metaphase chromosomes. Studies of X inactivation showed that mothers of affected boys from both families exhibited selective use of a single X chromosome as the active X chromosome in B cells but not T cells. This pattern is the same as that seen in obligate carriers of typical XLA. Linkage analysis demonstrated the most likely location for this gene (or genes) to be the midportion of the long arm of the X chromosome between DXS3 and DXS94. This segment of the X chromosome, which constitutes approximately 5% of the total X chromosome, encompasses the gene for XLA. These findings are consistent with the combination of XLA and growth hormone deficiency being caused by a small, contiguous, gene deletion syndrome involving the gene for XLA or an allelic variant of the gene for typical XLA.\r"

Six of the 12 patients had plasma fatty acid composition measured; because of possible essential fatty acid deficiency, urinary prostaglandin excretion was also measured. All patients had triglyceride levels between 1440 and 6120 mg/dl (16.25 to 69.09 mmol/L) before treatment. After treatment to promote blood glucose levels of 75 to 85 mg/dl (4.2 to 4.7 mmol/L), triglyceride levels in each of 11 patients were between 189 +/- 31 (2.13 +/- 0.35 mmol/L) and 510 +/- 60 mg/dl (5.76 +/- 0.68 mmol/L). The lipoprotein fatty acid composition in six patients showed a substantial elevation in C16:0, C16:1 omega 7, and C18:1 omega 9, but no increase in C20:3 omega 9 (the fatty acid that characteristically increases in essential fatty acid deficiency). In addition, each of the six patients had normal 24-hour urinary excretion of prostaglandin. One patient, whose triglyceride levels remained elevated despite dietary treatment, was given either clofibrate, lovastatin, niacin, or fish oil. With the exception of lovastatin, these agents produced a decrease in triglyceride values for 1 to 2 months; however, by 3 months triglycerides reached pretreatment levels. Combined treatment with clofibrate and niacin resulted in a sustained decrease in plasma triglyceride levels for 4 months. The findings indicate that dietary management of GSD-IA is usually associated with improvements in triglyceride levels; however, patients maintain triglyceride values between 300 and 500 mg/dl (3.38 to 5.65 mmol/L). No patient had biochemical evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency.\r"

The data were divided into three periods: (1) 10 days before the first DTP immunization was received (pre-DTP period), (2) 10 days immediately after the DTP (DTP period), and (3) 10 days after the DTP period (post-DTP period). Seventeen infants had at least one episode of prolonged apnea or prolonged bradycardia either before or after the 30-day study period (eight before only, eight after only, and one before and after). None of the infants had episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or more or bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or more during the pre-DTP or DTP period. One episode of apnea, 16 seconds long, and one episode of bradycardia lasting 11 seconds occurred in the post-DTP period. These results failed to confirm the clinical impression that DTP immunizations are associated with an increased frequency and severity of prolonged apnea. They also place in question the utility of assessing an infant's response to a DTP immunization to determine continued risk of apnea and bradycardia before home monitoring is discontinued.\r"

  ".W": "The Ballard Maturational Score was refined and expanded to achieve greater accuracy and to include extremely premature neonates. To test validity, accuracy, interrater reliability, and optimal postnatal age at examination, the resulting New Ballard Score (NBS) was assessed for 578 newly born infants and the results were analyzed. Gestational ages ranged from 20 to 44 weeks and postnatal ages at examination ranged from birth to 96 hours. In 530 infants, gestational age by last menstrual period was confirmed by agreement within 2 weeks with gestational age by prenatal ultrasonography (C-GLMP). For these infants, correlation between gestational age by NBS and C-GLMP was 0.97. Mean differences between gestational age by NBS and C-GLMP were 0.32 +/- 1.58 weeks and 0.15 +/- 1.46 weeks among the extremely premature infants (less than 26 weeks) and among the total population, respectively. Correlations between the individual criteria and C-GLMP ranged from 0.72 to 0.82. Interrater reliability of NBS, as determined by correlation between raters who rated the same subgroup of infants, ws 0.95. For infants less than 26 weeks of gestational age, the greatest validity (97% within 2 weeks of C-GLMP) was seen when the examination was performed before 12 hours of postnatal age. For infants at least 26 weeks of gestational age, percentages of agreement with C-GLMP remained constant, averaging 92% for all postnatal age categories up to 96 hours. The NBS is a valid and accurate gestational assessment tool for extremely premature infants and remains valid for the entire newborn infant population.\r"

  ".U": "91349965\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether changes in lung volume may be responsible for the clinical improvement in preterm infants given exogenous surfactant, we measured functional residual capacity (FRC), lung mechanics, and partial pressure of oxygen in seven ventilated neonates (birth weight 1080 +/- 361 gm (mean +/- SD); gestational age 28.3 +/- 2.6 weeks) less than 9 hours of age who had findings typical of hyaline membrane disease. All patients received 100 mg/kg calf lung surfactant extract. FRC was measured by a closed-circuit helium-dilution technique, and lung mechanics were determined by least mean squares analysis. FRC increased in all patients (range 56% to 330%; p less than 0.03). Dynamic lung compliance and total airway conductance did not change. Mean +/- SEM specific lung compliance (dynamic lung compliance/FRC) decreased 55.93% +/- 4.27% (p less than 0.02) and mean specific conductance (total airway conductance/FRC) decreased 45.91% +/- 9.74% (p less than 0.009). Mean alveolar/arterial partial pressure of oxygen ratio decreased 51.0% +/- 8.67% (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that the immediate improvement in oxygenation after surfactant administration is related to increased lung volumes. The decrease in specific lung compliance and specific airway conductance is suggestive of increased distention rather than recruitment of functional alveoli.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the neuroendocrine response in preterm infants to a pattern of tactile-kinesthetic stimulation that facilitates their growth and development. Preterm infants (mean gestational age 30 weeks, mean birth weight 1176 gm) received normal nursery care or tactile-kinesthetic stimulation for three 15-minute periods at the start of three consecutive hours each day for 10 days. On day 1 and day 10 of the study, a 24-hour urine sample was collected for norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, and creatinine assay and a blood sample was taken by heel stick for cortisol and growth hormone assay. Urine norepinephrine and epinephrine values increased significantly only in the stimulated babies. Urine dopamine and cortisol values increased in both groups, and serum growth hormone decreased in both groups. Individual differences in urine norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol values were highly stable across the 10 days despite a 10-fold range of values among the infants. The results of this study suggest that tactile-kinesthetic stimulation of preterm infants has fairly specific effects on maturation and/or activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition, this study has defined catecholamine and cortisol secretion across gestational age in normal preterm infants. Finally, these data suggest that highly stable individual levels of catecholamine and cortisol secretion are established by birth in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Using pulsed Doppler and two-dimensionally directed M-mode echocardiographic techniques, we measured left ventricular (LV) output, stroke volume, heart rate, LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimension, and LV percent fractional shortening (%FS) in 34 normal term infants 12 to 24 hours before parturition and thereafter serially 1, 24, and 96 hours after birth. Stroke volume was calculated as the product of the aortic flow velocity integral and aortic valve area. There was a twofold increase in LV output 1 hour after birth (fetal 170 +/- 46 ml/min/kg vs 1 hour 327 +/- 66 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.01) which was associated with significant increases in stroke volume, %FS, and LVEDD (stroke volume 1.21 +/- 0.33 ml/kg vs 2.25 +/- 0.37 ml/kg; %FS 34.3% +/- 5.8% vs 37.7% +/- 5.4%; LVEDD 15.4 +/- 1.1 mm vs 17.7 +/- 1.4 mm). Heart rate did not change 1 hour after birth. During the subsequent hours after birth, LV output decreased significantly to a value of 245 +/- 56 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.01) at 24 hours, which did not change 96 hours after birth. There were significant declines in stroke volume, LVEDD, and heart rate 24 hours after birth (stroke volume 2.02 +/- 0.42 ml/kg; LVEDD 17.0 +/- 1.1 mm; heart rate 121 +/- 11 beats/min). The %FS remained unchanged within the first 96 hours of age. These results indicate that the major regulator of LV output immediately after birth is stroke volume and not heart rate. The increase in stroke volume is related to an increase in LV size and LV myocardial contractility. Our data provide a useful basis for the interpretation of abnormal LV function in the early neonatal period.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook a prospective study to evaluate the relationship between the onset and degree of sedation and the midazolam plasma concentration in children between 6 and 18 years of age during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Thirteen boys and seven girls (median age 13.5 years) were studied. Midazolam was injected intravenously for 5 minutes, and the dose was titrated to sedation or a maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg was given. Plasma midazolam concentration was determined just before and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the start of midazolam injection. The patient's level of sedation was evaluated by an assistant at each blood sampling time. Clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal elimination (beta) half-life were estimated from a biexponential fit of the serial plasma midazolam concentrations. Mean beta half-life of midazolam was 47 +/- 26 minutes and mean clearance was 10.0 +/- 5.0 ml/min per kilogram of body weight. Maximum level of sedation occurred at 5 minutes after initiation of the injection and corresponded to a mean peak midazolam serum concentration of 229 +/- 39 micrograms/L. Thereafter, a decline of mean sedation scores paralleled the decrease in midazolam concentration. Mean oxygen saturation remained greater than 94% during the study. We conclude that children metabolize and excrete midazolam more rapidly than adults do and that sedation adequate for endoscopy is safely achieved in the majority of children with a midazolam dose of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg and a mean peak midazolam concentration greater than 200 microgram/L.\r"

Two had Candida parapsilosis, an agent not previously reported as a cause of neonatal endocarditis. All three infants were treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Despite administration of 44, 38, and 48 mg/kg amphotericin B, respectively, no nephrotoxicity was noted; 5-flucytosine therapy was stopped in one infant because of thrombocytopenia. One infant died of an unrelated cause 6 months later; there was no evidence of Candida or endocarditis at autopsy. The other two infants are thriving 2 and 3 years after the completion of antifungal therapy; no remaining evidence of endocarditis is present on echocardiography. We conclude that antifungal therapy without surgery is an option for Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants.\r"

Thirteen children with trisomy 21 without congenital heart disease who were short for age (-1.19 to -3.5 standard deviation score) and microcephalic (-1.58 to -6.60 standard deviation score) were given recombinant human growth hormone, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously, 3 days a week for 1 year. Before treatment, peak serum growth hormone concentrations were less than 10 micrograms/L after levodopa and clonidine stimulation tests in five patients, after clonidine in three patients, and after levodopa in three patients. Three patients had nocturnal integrated growth hormone concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 0.65 micrograms/L, respectively. The mean growth rate before treatment was 5.4 +/- 1.6 cm/yr and increased to 12.2 +/- 3.2 cm/yr (p less than 0.001) after 12 months of recombinant human growth hormone treatment. The mean head circumference standard deviation score before treatment was -3.1 +/- 1.3 and increased to -2.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.001) at 12 months. Bone age before and 1 year after treatment increased in correspondence with chronologic age. Plasma hemoglobin A1c concentration was normal during treatment with recombinant human growth hormone. The mean plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I at baseline and at 12 months were 0.54 +/- 0.19 U/ml and 1.25 +/- 0.97 U/ml, respectively (p less than 0.02). We conclude that recombinant human growth hormone therapy can result in a significant increase in annual growth rate and head circumference in children with Down syndrome, without significant side effects.\r"

This device functioned well as a filter but had an unacceptable 30% rate of migration, tilting, and penetration. Therefore a titanium Greenfield filter with modified hooks was developed and has been tested in 186 patients at 10 institutions. Successful placement occurred in 181 (97%); placement of the remainder was precluded by unfavorable anatomy. A contraindication to anticoagulation was the most frequent indication for insertion (75%). All but two were inserted percutaneously, predominantly via the right femoral vein (70%). Initial incomplete opening was seen in four patients (2%), which was corrected by guide wire manipulation and asymmetry of the legs in 10 (5.4%). Insertion site hematoma occurred in one patient, and apical penetration of the cava during insertion occurred in a second patient. Both events were without sequelae. Follow-up examinations were performed at 30 days at which time 35 deaths had occurred. Recurrent embolism was suspected in six patients (3%) and two of three deaths were confirmed by autopsy. Filter movement greater than 9 mm was seen in 13 patients, (11%) and increase in base diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm was seen in 17 patients (14%). CT scanning showed evidence of caval penetration in only one patient (0.8%). Insertion site venous thrombosis was seen in 4/46 (8.7%) patients screened. The modified hook titanium Greenfield filter is inserted percutaneously or operatively through a sheath, eliminating concern for misplacement from premature discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The external diameters of the proximal common carotid, common carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries were measured during operation with a caliper after 349 carotid endarterectomies. There were 309 saphenous vein reconstructions, 31 synthetic patch reconstructions, and 9 primary closures. One or more B-mode ultrasound studies with cross-sectional views for common and internal carotid cursor measurements were performed from 3 months to 5 years after operation. The intraoperative-to-postoperative common carotid diameters were unchanged for the three types of reconstructions. The internal carotid diameters increased 20% to 30% for both the vein and synthetic patched arteries. This dilation was present at 3 and 6 months and progressed slightly over 5 years. Wall thickening greater than or equal to 1 mm was present in 62% of the carotid endarterectomies, with concentric stenosis in 3% and eccentric stenosis in 59%. Eccentric stenosis was present at 3 to 6 months, located on the endarterectomized posterior-medial wall of the common and internal carotid arteries, was always less than 50%, and changed very little over 5 years. No aneurysms or internal carotid occlusions were identified. Carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction results in early, mild, nonaneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid patched segment, frequent mild eccentric restenosis, and rare hemodynamically significant concentric restenosis.\r"

We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation.\r"

Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a \"hostile\" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges.\r"

  ".U": "91350229\r", 
  ".W": "Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-seven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed. The arm/foot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction. Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard. The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein. The hand-held Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction. Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity. Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild, and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe. Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization. The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction. The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon. Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself. The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations. After perforator disruption, obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse, but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing. The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure.\r"

Twenty-two surgical repairs included bypass of severely damaged arteries in five, embolectomy in five, interposition grafts in three, pseudoaneurysm resection and primary repair in three, primary repair of three vascular injuries, and one patch angioplasty. Leg amputation was required in two patients. Seventeen of 19 patients had successful vascular repairs with resolution of preoperative indications for vascular repair without intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Long term follow-up (mean, 17 months) showed no recurrence of vascular problems; however, two patients died of metastatic cancer at 6 and 24 weeks after vascular repair. This study supports an aggressive approach to the management of vascular injuries caused by therapeutic interventions for malignancy despite the presence of metastatic disease.\r"

To better define the natural history of such lesions, 194 sequential aortograms in 48 patients were studied to define predictive criteria for stenoses at risk for progression. Sixty-six unsuspected atherosclerotic renal arterial stenoses were identified on the initial aortograms. Disease progressed in 42 arteries (53%), 14 bilateral and 28 unilateral. Seven arteries developed occlusion. All had stenoses averaging 80% (range 61% to 94%) noted on the most recent aortogram preceding occlusion. Risk factors including smoking, diabetes mellitus, elevated serum lipids, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or change in blood pressure or creatinine, did not correlate with degree or rate of progression of the renal artery stenosis. A difference in kidney size, although varying inversely with degree of stenosis, was not a statistically significant marker of disease progression. This analysis suggests that identification of renal arterial stenoses that will progress is best determined by sequential aortography. Highly stenotic vessels are more prone to occlude than those less stenotic. Consequently, individuals with preocclusive lesions should benefit from prophylactic renal revascularization during aortic reconstruction.\r"

Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency.\r"

Patients who were unstable or who had obvious arterial trauma were excluded. Injury was caused by gunshot in 104 (53%), blunt trauma in 42 (21%), stab wound in 34 (17%), and shotgun in 18 (9%). Duplex ultrasonography correctly characterized and localized vascular injuries in 23 patients: arterial disruptions (13), intimal flaps (4), acute pseudoaneurysms (3), arteriovenous fistulas (2), and shotgun pellet arteriopuncture (1). Nineteen other patients had vasospasm (13) or external compression (6) without evidence of intrinsic vessel injury, these 42 studies had true-positive results. Twenty patients underwent arterial repair (13 on the basis of duplex ultrasonography alone), one had primary amputation, three required fasciotomy, and 18 were observed. Two patients with false-negative results had minor shotgun pellet arteriopunctures that were missed by duplex ultrasonography, but neither needed repair. One hundred fifty-three patients had true-negative results on duplex ultrasonography: all clinically had only proximity injuries and easily palpable distal pulses. The result of one duplex ultrasonography study was found to be false-positive on arteriography. The sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the overall accuracy was 98%. These results closely approximate those reported with the use of exclusion arteriography in the evaluation of similar vascular trauma patients. Furthermore, duplex ultrasonography has no interventional risks and is more cost-effective for screening such injuries than arteriography or exploration. Duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method of diagnosis in patients with potential peripheral vascular injuries.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most important determinants of graft patency is the degree and character of vascular outflow. This study was designed to evaluate input impedance as a functional assessment of the outflow bed of vascular grafts. Four distinct outflow environments were created for external jugular vein conduits in 42 New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 14) were fashioned as end-to-side common carotid interposition bypass grafts. Arteriovenous fistulas (n = 15) were created by side-to-side anastomosis of the distal common carotid artery and linguofacial vein. Arteriovenous fistulas with outflow obstruction (n = 7) were fistulas with a metal clip partially obstructing the distal outflow channel (1 mm lumen). Vein graft/arteriovenous fistula combinations (n = 6) consisted of a vein graft and arteriovenous fistula in series. Pressure and flow in the external jugular vein were measured, and input impedance spectra were calculated by Fourier methods. By use of a PC-based acquisition and processing system, impedance results for 20 cardiac cycles could be obtained in approximately 10 minutes. The results revealed that vein grafts typically demonstrated high resistance to steady state flow (Rin = 235 +/- 50 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5) and steadily decreasing impedance to pulsatile flow resulting in a characteristic impedance (Z0; average of fourth to tenth harmonics) of 35.5 +/- 8.0 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5. Phase angle values were usually negative, especially at low harmonics (first harmonic phase angle = -1.11 +/- 0.10 radians) indicating that flow led pressure. In contrast, arteriovenous fistula Rin was minimal (6.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to vein graft, and the impedance was flat across the frequency spectrum (Z0 = 8.5 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05) with pressure and flow nearly in phase (first harmonic phase angle = -0.05 +/- 0.10 radians). Creation of outflow obstruction in arteriovenous fistulas resulted in significantly elevated Rin (136 +/- 41 x 10(3) dyne/sec . cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to arteriovenous fistula and Z0 (23 +/- 9 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess renal duplex sonography as an intraoperative study to detect technical defects during repair, 57 renal artery reconstructions in 35 patients were studied. Sixteen men and 19 women (mean age, 62 years) underwent unilateral (13 patients) or bilateral (22 patients) renal artery repair to 57 kidneys. Methods of repair included aortorenal bypass grafting in 29 cases (20 saphenous vein, 5 polytetrafluoroethylene, 4 Dacron), reimplantation in 7, transrenal thromboendarterectomy with patch angioplasty in 13, and transaortic extraction thromboendarterectomy in 8. Branch renal artery repair was required in six cases (five in vivo, one ex vivo). Fourteen patients had combined aortic replacement (11 patients: 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 3 aortic occlusions) or visceral artery reconstruction (three patients: three superior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomies, one inferior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomy). Intraoperative renal duplex sonography (mean scan time, 4.5 minutes) was complete in 56 of 57 repairs (98%), and renal duplex sonography was normal in 44 repairs (77%). Overall, B-scan defects were present in 13 repairs (23%). Six of these (11%) were defined as major B-scan defects by Doppler spectra with focal increases in peak systolic velocity greater than or equal to 2.0 meters/sec (major defect, mean renal artery peak systolic velocity, 3.1 m/sec), which prompted immediate operative revision. Seven B-scan defects were defined as minor by Doppler spectra (minor defect, mean renal artery, peak systolic velocity, 0.7 m/sec) and were not revised. Postoperative evaluation (range, 1 to 22 months; mean follow-up, 12.4 months) of 55 renal artery repairs in 34 operative survivors (surface renal duplex sonography, 33 patients; renal angiography, 9 patients) demonstrated 42/43 renal artery repairs with normal intraoperative renal duplex sonography, and 6/6 repairs with minor B-scan defects were patent and free of critical stenosis. Of the 6 renal artery revisions prompted by major B-scan defects, 4 remained patent, 1 stenosed, and 1 occluded. Our experience suggests that intraoperative renal duplex sonography during renal artery repair provides valuable anatomic and physiologic information. Renal artery repairs with normal renal duplex sonography and minor B-scan defects without Doppler spectral changes demonstrated 98% patency without critical stenosis at 12.4 months of mean follow-up. However, major B-scan defects defined by a focal increase in renal artery peak systolic velocity should be considered for immediate correction.\r"

This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a \"protected\" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "91350242\r", 
  ".W": "A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease.\r"

All dissections were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulant therapy. Neurologic deficits improved or disappeared in all symptomatic patients. On follow-up studies, one of the four internal carotid occlusions completely resolved with normalization of the duplex examination. All three dual lumen dissections remained patent on serial studies. Diagnostic duplex characteristics, both conclusive and supportive, of carotid dissections are described. Duplex scanning is shown to be accurate in diagnosing and ideally suited for serially following spontaneous carotid dissections.\r"

This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates.\r"

The innominate artery alone was involved in 21 patients (39%); the remaining patients had additional arch vessel obstructions. Before operation, neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 patients (46%), arm ischemia related to claudication and microembolization occurred in 8 patients (14%), a combination of symptoms occurred in 17 patients (32%), and no symptoms were noted in 4 patients (8%). The extrathoracic approach to surgery was used in 16 patients (30%). Eleven of the 38 patients in whom the intrathoracic approach was used had endarterectomy of the innominate artery; in three of those, the procedure was combined with left common carotid endarterectomy. Bypass grafts were used in the other 27 patients undergoing procedures with an intrathoracic approach; in six of those, bypass was combined with carotid endarterectomy. No operative deaths occurred. Perioperative revascularization failure occurred in four cases; all of those patients underwent a second revascularization procedure, with a secondary patency rate of 100%. In four patients, late occlusion was noted at 6 months and at 1, 1.5, and 10 years. One patient had a permanent perioperative neurologic deficit in the distribution of the left carotid artery after a combined common carotid endarterectomy/innominate endarterectomy procedure. No neurologic deficits were directly related to the innominate artery territory. Long-term actuarial survival was 83% at 10 years. Early and late graft failures were related to inadequate inflow in bypass grafts, progression of distal disease in arteritis, and primary closure in endarterectomy.\r"

Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--The clinical and laboratory features of patients with murine typhus have not been extensively reviewed since 1946. We have updated these findings in patients from south Texas who were examined by modern clinical and laboratory methods from 1980 through 1987. DESIGN.--Patients were identified by serological methods in this case series, and clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory, and therapeutic data were compiled and analyzed. SETTING.--The majority of patients (77 of 80) were identified in a primary care community hospital setting; the remainder (3 of 80) were ambulatory hospital outpatients. PATIENTS.--From 1980 through 1987, a total of 345 patients were diagnosed with murine typhus; 90 of these patients were seen at four hospitals in south Texas; of these, 80 had clinical and laboratory data available for review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The frequency of common clinical manifestations (eg, headache, fever, and rash) and laboratory findings (eg, leukocyte and platelet counts and serum chemistry abnormalities) of patients with infectious diseases was tabulated. Clinical severity was semiquantitatively assessed and was correlated with clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic results. RESULTS.--Most cases (69%) occurred from April through August. Rash occurred in 54%; the triad of fever, headache, and rash was observed in only 12.5% of patients when first examined by a physician; respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent. Multiple organ involvement was documented by frequent abnormal laboratory findings of the hematologic, respiratory, hepatic, and renal systems. Disease severity was related to older patient age, the presence of renal dysfunction, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia, and previous therapy with sulfa antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS.--Infection by Rickettsia typhi causes a systemic illness with clinical and laboratory abnormalities not previously recognized or described. Early clinical diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid undue morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--To analyze the working environment and work hours of a cohort of otolaryngology--head and neck surgery residents. DESIGN.--Environmental analysis questionnaire and a log of daily activities. SETTING.--Residents were on a clinical rotation system. PARTICIPANTS.--Fifty-nine residents from six programs, including three public and three private institutions, from geographically diverse regions of the country were involved in the study. Residents were equally distributed from their second year through their fifth year of postgraduate work. All eligible residents participated in and completed the study. INTERVENTION.--The environmental analysis survey was designed to elicit resident perception of different aspects of their working environment. The daily activity log required the resident to report on activities for each half-hour period for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS.--Residents were on call an average of 52.8 hours (2.2 days) and worked 79.4 hours per week. Seventy-five percent believed that the level of faculty supervision and the degree of resident responsibility was about right. Two major inefficiencies were the time involved in completion of paperwork and the lack of nonmedical support services. Thirty-one percent of the residents responded that fatigue resulted in substandard patient care 10% of the time. Forty-seven percent responded that their educational experience was substandard 25% of the time secondary to fatigue. Two thirds responded that the demands of residency training had a negative impact on their family and personal life. CONCLUSIONS.--Seventy percent of the otolaryngology--head and neck surgery residents surveyed at six institutions believe that an 80-hour workweek, including being on call every third night with no more than 24 hours of continuous work without sleep, approximates a reasonable, maximum work schedule. Residents working the longest hours expressed concern about rendering substandard care and developing negative attitudes toward patients. Noneducational inefficiencies were identified and solutions were proposed. Demands of residency training, even within guidelines established as reasonable, can have detrimental effects on residents' educational activities and personal life.\r"

The IFN response begins with the production of the IFN proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma), which then induce the antiviral, antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunomodulatory actions of IFN. Recent advances have led to Food and Drug Administration approval of five clinical indications for IFN. Interferon alfa is approved for hairy-cell leukemia, condyloma acuminatum, Kaposi's sarcoma in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-A, non-B (type C) viral hepatitis. Interferon gamma has properties distinctive from those of IFNs alpha and beta and is approved as an immunomodulatory treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. Promising clinical results with IFNs have also been reported for basal cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, early human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, and laryngeal papillomatosis. Future clinical uses of IFNs may emphasize combination therapy with other cytokines, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hyperthermia, or hormones.\r"

  ".U": "91350271\r", 
  ".W": "While the upper airway normally remains patent during quiet breathing in wakefulness and sleep, patients with obstructive sleep apnea have repetitive periods of upper airway closure during sleep. The upper airway closures usually occur at various sites in the pharynx. The patency of the potentially collapsible pharynx during inspiration depends on the balance between subatmospheric pressure in the pharyngeal airway and airway dilating forces generated by pharyngeal muscles. The pressure required to collapse the upper airway in the absence of upper airway muscle activity, ie, closing pressure, is normally subatmospheric. In obstructive sleep apnea, positive pressures are required to maintain patency of the passive upper airway. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying upper airway closures during sleep form the basis for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. In general, these treatment modalities attempt to (1) raise the pharyngeal pressure above the closing pressure, (2) decrease the closing pressure, or (3) increase upper airway muscle activity.\r"

Standardized patients, trained to consistently portray a wide variety of clinical cases, can help overcome many of these educational problems. This article describes the development and application of standardized patients throughout medical training at The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, in the freshman interviewing course, the second-year physical diagnosis course, third-year clerkships, a fourth-year final exercise, and residency training. Development of this program is discussed in the context of a broader literature in medical education, and investigation of variables affecting standardized patient and student performance is reported. Future directions for use of standardized patients in monitoring and promoting the development of clinical competence are discussed.\r"

The benefits to the institution include improved public relations with a decedent's family, compliance with state and federal laws, increased organ donations, and better risk management programs. The only drawback of establishing such an office is the additional personnel necessary for 24-hour coverage. However, modifications in the functions and staffing levels of a decedent affairs office may be made, depending on the needs of individual institutions. We hypothesized that consent for autopsy would be easier to obtain and cause less emotional upheaval for family members if procedures were well established and specially trained individuals were involved in the process. With these ideas in mind, we established a decedent affairs office at The University of Texas Medical Branch in 1984.\r"

DESIGN.--All cocaine-exposed infants in the study population (n = 355) were compared with a random sample of unexposed infants (n = 199). Regression analysis was used to control for the independent effects of maternal age, smoking, alcohol consumption, prenatal care, race, gravidity, and sex of the infant. SETTING.--A large, public, inner-city hospital studied from 1985 to 1986. PATIENTS.--All infants were routinely tested for illicit substances, records were reviewed for maternal histories of substance abuse, and all known cocaine-exposed singleton infants were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Cost and length of stay until each infant was medically cleared for hospital discharge and cost and length of stay until each infant was actually discharged from the hospital. RESULTS.--Neonatal hospital costs until medically cleared for discharge were $5200 more for cocaine-exposed infants than for unexposed infants (a difference of $7957 vs $2757 [P = .003]). The costs of infants remaining in the nursery while awaiting home and social evaluation or foster care placement increased this difference by more than $3500 (P less than .0001). Compared with other forms of cocaine, fetal exposure to crack was associated with much larger cost increases ($6735 vs $1226). Exposure to other illicit substances in addition to cocaine was also associated with much larger cost increases ($8450 vs $1283). CONCLUSIONS.--At the national level, we estimate that these individual medical costs add up to about $500 million. The large magnitude of these costs indicates that effective treatment programs for maternal cocaine abusers could yield savings within their first year of operation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE.--There is strong evidence that developmental dyslexia is both familial and heritable, but the mode of genetic transmission has remained unclear. In this article, we examine specific genetic hypotheses about the mode of transmission of developmental dyslexia by performing complex segregation analyses. DESIGN.--A family study method was applied, whereby the relatives of dyslexic probands were examined for dyslexia. The families studied represent four independently ascertained samples. SETTING.--The four samples of families were primarily from rural and suburban communities of Colorado, Washington State, and Iowa. PARTICIPANTS.--A total of 204 families and 1698 individuals in the four samples combined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The complex segregation program, POINTER, was used to test competing genetic hypotheses of how a categorical trait (dyslexia) is transmitted in families. RESULTS.--The results were consistent with major locus transmission in three of four samples and with polygenic transmission in the fourth. In these three samples, the estimates of penetrance for the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes (where A is the abnormal allele) were, respectively, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.001 to 0.039 in males, and 0.560 to 1.000, 0.550 to 0.897, and 0.000 in females. The estimated gene frequency of the major locus was between 3% and 5%. CONCLUSIONS.--Sex-influenced, additive, or dominant transmission occurs in a significant proportion of dyslexic families. Other evidence indicates, however, that dyslexia is etiologically heterogeneous and that there is genetic heterogeneity even among families selected for apparent dominant transmission. Thus, while no single major locus may account for all of dyslexia, it is important to pursue potential major loci for dyslexia using linkage techniques.\r"

DESIGN.--Year-long randomized, controlled trial comparing (1) higher-intensity group-based exercise training; (2) higher-intensity home-based exercise training; (3) lower-intensity home-based exercise training; or (4) assessment-only control. SETTING.--General community located in northern California. PARTICIPANTS.--One hundred sixty women and 197 men 50 to 65 years of age who were sedentary and free of cardiovascular disease. One out of nine persons contacted through a community random-digit-dial telephone survey and citywide promotion were randomized. INTERVENTIONS.--For higher-intensity exercise training, three 40-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 73% to 88% of peak treadmill heart rate. For lower-intensity exercise training, five 30-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 60% to 73% of peak treadmill heart rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Treadmill exercise test performance, exercise participation rates, and heart disease risk factors. RESULTS.--Compared with controls, subjects in all three exercise training conditions showed significant improvements in treadmill exercise test performance at 6 and 12 months (P less than .03). Lower-intensity exercise training achieved changes comparable with those of higher-intensity exercise training. Twelve-month exercise adherence rates were better for the two home-based exercise training conditions relative to the group-based exercise training condition (P less than .0005). There were no significant training-induced changes in lipid levels, weight, or blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS.--We conclude that (1) this community-based exercise training program improved fitness but not heart disease risk factors among sedentary, healthy older adults; (2) home-based exercise was as effective as group exercise in producing these changes; (3) lower-intensity exercise training was as effective as higher-intensity exercise training in the home setting; and (4) the exercise programs were relatively safe.\r"

Although cicatricial pemphigoid has been classified clinically, histopathologically, and immunopathologically, no definite initiating factor or precipitating factor has been identified. In this report, we describe five cases of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid that developed following an acute episode of severe ocular inflammatory injury secondary to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The time lag between the onset of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid ranged from a few months to 31 years. All five patients had linear immune deposits characteristic of cicatricial pemphigoid along the basement membrane zone of mucosal biopsy specimens as detected by either direct immunofluorescence microscopy or direct immunoperoxidase staining. In two patients whose serum was tested, a Western blot assay taken of keratinocyte antigens that had undergone electrophoresis reacted with the serum and identified a 120-kd epidermal antigen detected by the IgG class antibodies. All five patients were treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for cicatricial pemphigoid, and we obtained objective responses. Severe ocular mucosal injury such as that which occurs in Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be a precipitating factor in the development of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.\r"

  ".W": "The nation has experienced a marked increase in measles cases during 1989 and 1990. Almost one half of all cases have occurred in unvaccinated preschool children, mostly minorities. The principal cause for the epidemic is failure to provide vaccine to vulnerable children on schedule. Major reasons for the low vaccine coverage exist within the health care system itself, which creates barriers to obtaining immunization and fails to take advantage of many opportunities to provide vaccines to children. Ideally, immunizations should be given as part of a comprehensive child health care program. However, immunization cannot await the development of such an ideal system. Essential changes can and should be made now. Specific recommendations include improved availability of immunization; improved management of immunization services; improved capacity to measure childhood immunization status; implementation of the two-dose measles vaccine strategy; and laboratory, epidemiologic, and operational studies to further define the determinants of decreased vaccine coverage and to develop new combinations of vaccines that can be administered earlier in life. The measles epidemic may be a warning flag of problems with our system of primary health care.\r"

  ".W": "Removal of one kidney results in prompt increases in urinary excretion of NaCl and water from the remaining kidney, followed rather soon thereafter by increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At 12-15 h and 24 h after contralateral nephrectomy, the single nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) is increased, accompanied by parallel increases in absolute proximal tubular reabsorption, late proximal tubular and early distal tubular flow rates, suggesting that these events might be critical to the increased urinary excretion. However, micropuncture studies 2-4 h after contralateral nephrectomy demonstrate that increased SNGFR and even increased distal tubular flow rates are not requirements for augmented urinary excretion, suggesting that decreased tubular reabsorption in the most distal nephron segments causes the increase in urinary excretion. Analysis of TGF profiles by stop-flow pressure response at 2-4 h after contralateral nephrectomy have suggested suppression of TGF as assessed by a rightward shift in the turning point with increasing late proximal tubular perfusion. However, our studies have examined SNGFR responses and shown no suppression of TGF profiles but a downward shift in the operating point, suggesting activation of TGF and a modest reduction in SNGFR, determined from distal tubular collections. Although SNGFR was increased at all late proximal perfusion rates 12 h after nephrectomy, the turning point (V 1/2) was not altered. TGF profiles are not suppressed within 12 h after nephrectomy while SNGFR is increased. Suppression of TGF does not cause the increase in SNGFR after nephrectomy and TGF activity is maintained and adapts to increases in SNGFR caused by TGF-independent mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism was studied in rats with chronic partial ureteral occlusion (hydronephrosis) with the use of the stop-flow pressure techniques and measurements of single nephron glomerular filtration rate. In hydropenic conditions, TGF was normal in hydronephrotic kidneys, but TGF sensitivity and activity increased in response to extracellular volume expansion, which is the opposite of normal resetting. The increased sensitivity may be due to an increased production of thromboxane A2 in the hydronephrotic kidney, since both inhibition of thromboxane synthetase and blockade of thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors normalized the resetting during volume expansion. Pelvic pressure in hydronephrotic kidneys was low in hydropenia and increased moderately during volume expansion. Thromboxane synthesis inhibition before volume expansion allowed pelvic pressure to increase by more than 100% as compared with untreated hydronephrotics. Also, when pelvic pressure increases were prevented during volume expansion, TGF resetting was normalized. An increased thromboxane synthesis during volume expansion may be protective in hydronephrotic kidneys, in that TGF resets to a higher sensitivity to prevent increases in glomerular filtration rate and urine formation which otherwise would increase pelvic pressure. A resetting to a higher sensitivity was also elicited by intraarterial or intratubular administration of bradykinin. This suggests that thromboxane release may be mediated through an increased bradykinin production during volume expansion in hydronephrotics. In contrast, bradykinin resets TGF to a lower sensitivity in control kidneys.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that hydropenic one-kidney, one-clip (1-K, 1-C) hypertensive HT rats exhibit impaired autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to reduced arterial perfusion pressure. We investigated the possible role of altered tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activity in this phenomenon. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats were studied acutely 3 weeks after placing silver clips (0.2 mm) on the renal artery. Experiments were performed in 1-K,1-C HT rats and in uninephrectomized control animals. TGF activity was assessed as changes in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (SFP) in response to orthograde microperfusion from 0 to 80 nl/min into late proximal tubule segments. Only the highest perfusion rates (approximately 40 nl/min) into late proximal tubule segments resulted in maximal decreases in SFP, indicating a marked rightward shift of overall TGF activity in 1-K,1-C HT rats. Similar responses were observed in the uninephrectomized animals. In contrast, changes of SFP were observed at lower perfusion rates in normal animals and maximal responses were observed at perfusion rates of approximately 20 nl/min. These observations are consistent with the possibility that altered TGF activity contributes to impaired autoregulation of GFR in 1-K,1-C HT rats in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure. In response to treatment with i.v. captopril, the 1-K,1-C HT rats exhibited marked decreases in systemic arterial pressure associated with decreases in SFP and virtually complete inhibition of TGF activity. It is attractive to hypothesize that these alterations in TGF characteristics in the 1-K,1-C HT rats play a significant pathophysiologic role in the acute renal dysfunction observed in response to acute decreases of blood pressure during conditions of augmented angiotensin activity. Additional future studies will allow us to address the precise role for intrarenal angiotensin in these phenomena.\r"

The magnitude of the TGF responses of SNGFR was less in ATS rats than in control rats (17% +/- 4% vs 34% +/- 5%), but that of SFP was not significantly different (18% +/- 2% vs 23% +/- 1%).

Yet, the increase in filtration fraction in the whole kidney clearance study suggests a preferential postglomerular arteriolar constriction. Taken together, endothelin, which is a very potent renal vasoconstrictor, seems to constrict both preglomerular and postglomerular arterioles with a predominant constriction of the latter at the doses employed. (2) The endothelin-induced natriuresis is due to a fall in tubular reabsorption, reflecting a direct tubular action, possibly related to an elevation in blood pressure. (3) At the doses of endothelin used and under the present experimental conditions, changes in the magnitude of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response or the feedback characteristic could not be detected. (4) No evidence was found for a participation of endothelin in the pathogenesis of acute postischemic renal failure, as evidenced by the absence of an improvement in glomerular filtration after treatment with endothelin antiserum.\r"

We have shown that the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism is highly activated in these nephrons. Techniques have been developed for measurements on these nephrons without disrupting the normal flow to the macula densa. The tubular flow rate was measured by a real-time videodensitometric method in juxtamedullary nephrons in Lewis x DA rats. For the determination of tubular fluid composition a small fraction (less than 10%) of the fluid was sampled. Measurements were also performed according to the conventional technique, where all the tubular fluid was sampled. Despite a more than twofold increase in tubular flow rate when the flow to the macula densa region was interrupted, sodium concentration was only reduced by 25%, whereas potassium concentration was reduced by 40%. The results demonstrate that interruption of the urine flow to the macula densa results in a 52% increase in the tubular load of Na in the loop of Henle of juxtamedullary nephrons, and a corresponding increase of 24% for K. Thus, TGF exerts a strong influence on these nephrons which is why previous data on water and electrolyte loads, based on stop-flow measurements, greatly overestimate these loads.\r"

Stimulation of cAMP formation by forskolin, inhibition of calmodulin by calmidazolium, and inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by ethylisopropylamiloride enhanced renin secretion. Raising of intracellular cGMP by 8-bromo-cGMP and activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester led to an inhibition of secretion. Renin synthesis was stimulated by forskolin. Calmidazolium, EIPA, 8-bromo-cGMP, and phorbol ester were without effect on basal renin synthesis. The data suggest that renin secretion is influenced by a number of transmembrane transduction systems which in their majority exert a negative control on renin secretion. Activation of adenylate cyclase appears to be a stimulatory control mechanism for both the secretion and the synthesis of renin. The findings suggest, moreover, that the second messenger controls of renin secretion and renin synthesis are not strictly linked in renal JG cells.\r"

TGF response was assessed by measuring NGFR in the absence of loop of Henle perfusion and during perfusion at 40 nl/min with tubular fluid from normal or salt loaded rats and expressed as NGFR40/NGFR0. (1) Loop of Henle perfusion with tubular fluid from normal rats elicited a TGF response of 50.3% +/- 7.9% (mean +/- SEM) in normal rats and 57.2% +/- 7.9% in salt loaded rats. With tubular fluid from high salt rats, TGF response in normal rats was 97.4% +/- 6.3% and in salt loaded rats 98.0% +/- 1.6%. Participation of adrenal steroids in the inhibition is suggested by the following results: (2) Acute adrenalectomy (ADX) in high salt rats abolished the TGF inhibitory potency of high salt tubular fluid. TGF response in salt loaded rats with high salt tubular fluid from high salt ADX rats was 62.3% +/- 3.0%. Substitution of high salt ADX rats with matching adrenal venous blood from high salt rats restored TGF inhibition. (3) With cross over experiments the effect of heterologous adrenal venous blood substitution on TGF inhibitory activity was studied. The TGF response in high salt rats with high salt tubular fluid and tubular fluid from normal ADX rats substituted with adrenal venous blood collected from high salt rats was 88.9% +/- 5.5% and 91.7% +/- 6.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
