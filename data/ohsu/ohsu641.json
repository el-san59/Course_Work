  ".W": "IL-1 is a cytokine with a wide variety of effects on cells involved in inflammatory and immune responses, hemopoiesis, and bone formation. Many cell types have been shown to produce IL-1 in vitro; however, very little is known about the source and role of IL-1 in vivo. By using in situ hybridization, we examined the tissue distribution of cells containing IL-1 mRNA in normal C57BL/6 mice. The results show that many organs contain IL-1 mRNA-positive cells, but the highest frequency was found in lymphoid organs. The distribution and localization of these cells suggest that many of the IL-1 mRNA-producing cells are tissue macrophages. Organs exposed to environmental Ag and microbial products (lymph nodes, liver, intestine, lung, and uterus) had high frequencies of IL-1 mRNA-producing cells, suggesting that IL-1 is produced in local inflammatory or immune responses in vivo. The production of IL-1 mRNA in the thymus and in the bone marrow suggests that IL-1 is available to play physiologic roles in T cell differentiation and in hemopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 and TNF-alpha are induced in macrophages by LPS; however, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms control the expression of both genes. Here, we report on the detection of differential regulation of LPS induced IL-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression and protein production in murine macrophages based on the use of inhibitors of second messenger pathways. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA obtained from murine (C57Bl/6) peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro with LPS with or without an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKc)(1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine hydrochloride; H7) or an inhibitor of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase (N-(6-amino-hexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide hydrochloride; W7). Northerns were analyzed with probes for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The expression of the three cytokine mRNA by LPS was inhibited in a dose response manner by H7. In contrast, the expression of IL-1 mRNA, but not TNF-alpha mRNA, was blocked by treatment with W7. Parallel studies monitoring biologic activities of these two cytokines confirm the mRNA data. PKc inhibitors, H7 and retinal, block both IL-1 and TNF-alpha protein production and inhibitors of CaM kinase, W7, N-(6-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide, calmidazolum, and trifluoperazine dichloride inhibit only IL-1 production. These data suggest that both PKc and CaM kinase dependent pathways are involved in the induction of IL-1 mRNA by LPS. In contrast, TNF-alpha expression appears to be PKc dependent but not CaM kinase dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The gene of a cytokine designated IFN-beta-2, or IL-6, and recently identified as identical to the B cell-stimulatory factor 2, is transcribed at high levels in the spleen, liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes of normal individuals. The number of IFN-beta-2/IL-6 transcripts present endogenously in normal human tissues (0.6 to 16 copies/cell) is comparable to that present in normal cells induced in vitro with human rTNF. This is in marked contrast to the absence of detectable IFN-beta-1 transcripts (less than 0.0003 copy/cell) in the same samples of human tissue. The expression of the IFN-beta-2/IL-6 gene is closely associated with that of two other cytokines TNF, and IL-1. Thus, significant levels of IFN-beta-2/IL-6, TNF, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta, mRNA were detected in all the samples of normal tissue tested and those samples which contained high levels of IFN-beta/IL-6 mRNA also contained high levels of TNF, and IL-1 beta mRNA. These results suggest that these cytokines may function in consort as regulators of cellular growth and function in normal tissues.\r"

In addition, we have demonstrated that LT and TNF, but not IL-1, stimulate increases in EC RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and cellular volumes, changes which may correspond to the hypertrophy of EC seen at sites of inflammation in vivo. It is reported here that both human rIL-1 alpha and rIL-1 beta totally inhibit the increases in EC RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and cell volumes induced by either TNF or LT. As little as 0.1 ng/ml of either IL-1 was sufficient to totally block the activation of EC induced by 100-fold higher concentrations (10 ng/ml) of either LT or TNF. The relevance of these findings to the regulation of inflammatory responses is discussed.\r"

Fluid-phase C activation was induced through addition of purified bacterial Ag to human serum. Sephadex beads were used as particulate activators of the alternative pathway. Rabbit or antibody-coated sheep or human E were used to study formation of cytolytic C5b-9(m) complexes. The molar ratios of C3a:C5a generated in the model systems were found to be in the range of 60 to 200:1 in the case of soluble immune complex activators, and 70 to 150:1 with particulate activators and cells. The efficiency of C5 cleavage relative to C3 cleavage increased on surfaces with the density of antibody and/or C3b-binding sites. With soluble immune complexes, the efficiency of subsequent SC5b-9 generation displayed wide variations dependent on Ag and donor with molar ratios of C5a:SC5b-9 ranging from 30:1 for teichoic acid and sometimes approaching 1:1 for streptolysin-O. In contrast, activation on particles or cells always led to C5a:C5b-9 (calculated as the sum of generated moles SC5b-9 and C5b-9(m] ratios approaching 1:1. Hence, there is an overall inefficiency of terminal sequence activation in the C cascade due first to a dissociation at the level of C5 convertase formation/C5-cleavage and second, to a frequent inefficiency of C5b-utilization in the fluid-phase. The results provide an explanation for the very low levels of SC5b-9 found in plasma of healthy individuals and in patients with C-consuming immune complex disease.\r"

Their binding pattern to either heat-denatured IgE or a family of overlapping IgE-derived recombinant peptides and their ability to affect interaction of IgE with its low affinity receptor Fc epsilon R2/CD23 demonstrate that they recognize distinct epitopes on the IgE molecule. All three mAb were able to induce basophil degranulation as measured by the induction of histamine release. mAb 173 recognizes a thermolabile epitope in the CH4 domain. It does not affect the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon R2/CD23. mAb 272 recognizes a thermostable epitope that maps to a sequence of 36 amino acids (AA) spanning part of the CH2 and CH3 domain and it does not affect the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon R2/CD23. mAb 27 recognizes a thermolabile epitope located on a 10 AA stretch (AA 367-376) in the CH3 domain. This area contains one N-linked oligosaccharide (Asn-371), but the antibody is not directed against carbohydrate because it binds to Escherichia coli-derived IgE peptides. mAb 27 inhibits the binding of IgE to Fc epsilon R2/CD23 but is still capable of reacting with IgE already bound to Fc epsilon R2/CD23. These data suggest that upon binding to Fc epsilon R2/CD23, the IgE molecule engages one of two equivalent-binding sites close to the glycosylated area of the CH3 domain.\r"

This process is accompanied by the acquisition of cytoplasmic granules in approximately 60% of the cells and by the expression of esterase activity cleaving the synthetic substrate BLT. The esterase activity, localized in the cytoplasmic granules, was purified and characterized. Three proteins with 3H-DFP binding activity were isolated and had the following properties. Following the proposed nomenclature by Masson et al., the esterases were named human granzymes 1, 2, and 3. Human granzyme 1 on SDS-PAGE has an unreduced relative m.w. of 43,000 and can form disulfide-linked oligomers of relative higher m.w. All forms of granzyme 1 bind 3H-DFP. Upon reduction, granzyme 1 migrates with Mr 30,000 on SDS-PAGE. Additional proteolytic fragments of Mr 24,000 and Mr 28,000 are observed in some reduced preparations. Granzyme 1 cleaves the substrate BLT and appears homologous with murine granzyme A. Human granzyme 2 has an unreduced relative m.w. of 30,000; after reduction, it migrates at Mr 32,000. Even though granzyme 2 binds 3H-DFT, it does not cleave BLT. Human granzyme 2 has properties similar to those of murine granzymes B-H. Human granzyme 3 has unreduced and reduced relative m.w. of 25,000 and 28,000, respectively. It is active in cleaving the substrate BLT. A murine analog for human granzyme 3 has not been described previously. N-terminal sequencing of the purified human granzymes revealed that human granzyme 1 is the gene product of human Hanuka factor cDNA clone and that it represents the human homolog to murine granzyme A. Similarly, human granzyme 2 revealed absolute identity with cDNA-derived N-terminal sequence of a putative human lymphocyte protease cDNA clone.\r"

In a series of experiments, we have established that this antiserum blocks the suppressive activity of Con A- or IFN-activated suppressor cells. These data establish that Con A- or IFN-activated suppressor cells exert some or all of their suppressive effects via SIRS. Further studies show that SIRS acts primarily during the induction of CTL and not at the effector phase. Last, we show that SIRS is not involved in the radiation-resistant Ag-specific suppressor cell circuit that can be induced during the in vitro MLR.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence has demonstrated a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent step in cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation. Here, we examined the influence of PKC in the lytic response of human NK cells to K562, an NK-sensitive tumor target cell. We used the known protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7) and HA1004. H-7 caused a dose-related inhibition of NK cell-mediated cytolysis (CMC) when the inhibitor was present throughout the course of the 3-h chromium release assay. The 50% inhibitory concentration for H-7 was 7 microM. In contrast, HA1004, which exerts a greater inhibitory effect on cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases than PKC, had no effect on NK-CMC. The suppression of NK-CMC by H-7 was not due to inhibition of binding of the effector cells to target cells and could be reversed by the addition of PMA. H-7 was most effective in abrogating NK-CMC when added to the assay within the first 30 min and treatment of the effector and target cells with H-7 resulted in no loss of NK-CMC. Because nearly 50% of the normal NK lytic activity had taken place by 30 min, this suggested that H-7 inhibited an early event. H-7 exerted a dose-related suppression of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) suggesting that NK-CMC and ADCC share the utilization of PKC, however, HA1004 did not inhibit ADCC. Treating NK cells with IL-2 or IFN-beta did not overcome the inhibition of NK-CMC by H-7. In this study, we have thus demonstrated the presence of a PKC-dependent step in NK-CMC and ADCC.\r"

In contrast, the cell did not respond to C1, in which the collagen-like region of the C1q molecule is masked. The C1q-induced hyperpolarizing response was inhibited by collagen or C1q-specific antisera. Human diploid skin fibroblasts (Flow 1,000 cells) also exhibited similar membrane potential changes in response to whole C or C1q. After repeated applications of C1q, the cell membrane became unresponsive (desensitized). The treatment of L cells with pronase E inhibited the C1q-induced response, whereas the response to ATP, which is known to interact to its own receptor, was still preserved. The reversal potential of C responses was close to the K+ equilibrium potential. The hyperpolarizing response was inhibited by a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in fibroblasts (quinine), by deprivation of extracellular Ca2+ or by a Ca2+ channel blocker (nifedipine). By means of Ca2+-selective microelectrodes, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was found to increase from 126 to 206 nM upon stimulation of L cells with C1q. Using an agarose-well method, L cells were observed to migrate predominantly toward C1q or whole C. It is concluded that the fibroblasts have the C1q receptor sensitive to pronase E and that activation of C1q receptors gives rise to Ca2+ influx, triggering an increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ ions, which in turn induces a hyperpolarizing response as a result of the stimulation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels and initiates chemotaxis to C1q.\r"

However, two high affinity antibodies binding to non-lipid A epitopes did not block cellular activation.

The levels of cytotoxicity were 29.8 +/- 7.0% in five MM, 15.9 +/- 4.9% in seven SCC, and 4.0 +/- 2.3% in five BCE patients at an effector/target ratio of 50/1. Allogeneic MM targets were lysed by LAK from all three types of cancer patients at similar levels, implying that LAK is not restricted to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. These results indicate that the levels of autologous LAK activity were significantly associated with the magnitude of clinical malignancy of the tumor targets, and suggested the selective lysis of tumor targets by LAK. NK activity of cancer patients bearing tumors was also examined prior to therapy. The levels of NK activity observed in MM patients were considerably lower than those in two other cancer patients.\r"

A small area of the buttocks of volunteers was exposed to UVB-irradiation and biopsies were taken at various time intervals. Epidermal keratinocytes in culture from the same subjects were exposed to UVC with doses chosen to elicit comparable yields of dimers in cellular DNA. The initial density of pyrimidine dimers and the kinetics of their removal were assessed utilizing the dimer-specific T4 endonuclease V and sedimentation of the unlabeled DNA through alkaline sucrose gradients. The position of DNA in the gradients was determined using a monoclonal antibody against random sequences of single-stranded DNA in a sensitive immunoassay. The initial dimer frequency was 3.9-6.7 per 10(8) daltons DNA. About 40% of the dimers were removed within 1 h, 70% in 6 h, and 90% in 24 h for both in vivo and in vitro samples. The early rapid removal phase may represent preferential repair of actively transcribed genes. Our findings reaffirm the usefulness and applicability of cell culture systems to model in vivo repair phenomena. The use of monoclonal antibodies to detect single-stranded DNA in alkaline sucrose gradients may be of value in a variety of studies involving human tissues in which it is not possible to use radioactive labeling of the DNA for the analysis.\r"

They commonly demonstrate rheumatoid factor, hypergammaglobulinemia, antinuclear and Ro(SS-A) La(SS-B) antibody activity. This study indicates that these patients are also immunogenetically similar, sharing a statistically significant increased frequency of HLA-B8, DR3, DRW6, DQ2, and DRw52. Sixty-three percent of these SS/LE patients possess the extended haplotype (P-value 6.0 X 10(-3); RR 9.5) HLA-B8, DR3, DQ2, DRw52. One hundred percent of this SS/LE cohort was DR3 or DRw6 (P-value less than or equal to 5.0 X 10(-3); relative risk 19.1). Fifty percent of these patients were HLA DR3/DRw6 heterozygotes (P-value 1.5 X 10(-6); relative risk 31.2). Thus, HLA-DR3 and DRw6 Ro(SS-A) positive SS/LE patients may possess a similar, if not unique, DR region DNA nucleotide sequence involved in disease susceptibility or immune regulation.\r"

We have utilized an in vitro lymphocyte adherence assay to examine the mechanism(s) mediating lymphocyte migration into psoriatic skin. In this assay, we assessed the binding of lymphocytes overlaid onto frozen biopsy sections of normal and psoriatic skin. Lymphocytes isolated from human blood and rat thoracic duct bound specifically to dermal endothelia in psoriatic plaques but not to those of uninvolved skin from psoriatic patients or skin from normal individuals; analysis of the binding properties of B cells and T lymphocyte subsets revealed a preferential binding of CD4+ T cells compared with CD8+ T cells or B cells. This lymphocyte-endothelial interaction is an energy- and calcium-dependent process and involves surface protein and carbohydrate moieties, requirements similar to those found in lymphocyte interaction with post-capillary high endothelial venules (HEV) in lymphoid tissues. However, preincubation of lymphocytes with antibodies directed against surface molecules mediating adhesion to HEV of peripheral lymph node and gut-associated lymphoid tissue did not interfere with the capacity of lymphophocytes to bind to the skin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that emigration of lymphocytes from vasculature into psoriatic skin is promoted by the presence of specialized endothelia in psoriatic dermis capable of mediating specific lymphocyte-endothelial interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is known to stimulate dermal wound healing events (fibroplasia and fibrosis). In this study, the effect of TGF-beta on epidermal wound healing (re-epithelialization) was examined. Epidermal cell outgrowth from partial-thickness porcine skin explants was used as an in vitro model for epithelialization. All cultures were grown in medium with 1% fetal bovine serum, which was sufficient for explant viability but low enough to permit measurement of modulation by added factors. Because TGF-beta is known to act in concert with other growth factors, it was evaluated alone and in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The results indicate that TGF-beta produced earlier initiation of outgrowth, by 1-2 d compared with control cultures, and increased the rate of outgrowth during the migratory phase of culture (Days 1-3). Compared to controls, EGF alone produced a greater percentage of growing explants and an increased rate of outgrowth during the mitotic phase (Days 4-7). TGF-beta (1 or 10 ng/ml) and EGF (5 ng/ml) had an additive rather than a synergistic effect on outgrowth. PDGF-treated explants did not show enhanced growth when PDGF (2.5 units/ml) was added alone or together with TGF-beta and EGF. The ability of TGF-beta to produce earlier initiation of outgrowth was not due to an effect on mitosis, because TGF-beta did not increase the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into keratinocytes in the growing epidermal sheets. Rather, it is likely that TGF-beta facilitated keratinocyte migration, possibly by unmasking a receptor on the epidermal cell surface. These results suggest that TGF-beta may play a role in early epidermal wound healing.\r"

Ninety clindamycin-resistant and 22 clindamycin-susceptible isolates of C. difficile from 1985 were examined for plasmids. A clindamycin-resistant organism contained a cryptic plasmid of 3.1 kilobases (kb). None of the clindamycin-susceptible isolates contained the 3.1-kb plasmid, as compared with 40 of 90 clindamycin-resistant isolates (P less than .005). Restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization were used to confirm the identity of the 3.1-kb plasmid between strains.

All 34 patients underwent a detailed psychiatric examination and x-ray computed tomography scan, and matched research criteria for Alzheimer's disease (n = 13), senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (n = 9), or multi-infarct dementia (n = 12). In comparison with a senile control group (n = 7), mean CBF of both the whole brain and the temporo-parietal region was significantly less in the Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia Alzheimer type groups, but no significant difference was seen between the senile control group and multi-infarct dementia group. The correlation was 0.72 (p less than 0.004) between the mean CBF of the whole brain and the score of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale, and 0.94 (p less than 0.0001) between rCBF of the temporo-parietal region and the scale in Alzheimer's disease. In the senile dementia Alzheimer type group, the correlations were 0.77 (p less than 0.01) and 0.83 (p less than 0.004) respectively. No significant correlations were found in the multi-infarct dementia group. A temporo-parietal reduction in the distribution of the rCBF characteristic in the Alzheimer's disease group and a patchy whole brain reduction characteristic in the multi-infarct dementia group was detected. The ability of our improved SPECT to provide both quantitative measurement of rCBF and characteristic rCBF distribution patterns, makes it a promising tool for research or routine examination of demented patients.\r"

TACs were classified into three types: type I, an initial high uptake and rapid washout type, type II, an initial high uptake and slow washout one, and type III, an initial low uptake one. L/N ratios of angioblastic meningiomas were over 300%, while those of many fibroblastic ones were under 100%, at most 105%. We compared L/N ratios with angiographic vascularities and histologic types and conclude that dynamic SPECT with [123I]IMP is the examination of choice for evaluating the vascularity of lesions.\r"

Lymphoma radioactivity reached a plateau at 0.42 +/- 0.22%. 100 cc-1 of the injected dose from 10 min after injection. The highest 11C uptakes were observed in the kidneys and in the liver (3.30 +/- 1.30 and 2.10 +/- 0.05%. 100 cc-1 of the injected dose, respectively). The lymphoma-to-muscle ratio was of 11.8 +/- 1.7, whereas the lymphoma-to-intestine ratio was of 1.5 +/- 0.7. Accordingly, the measurement of [11C]TdR uptake in the abdomen may need other imaging methods for adequate interpretation.

Internal radiation absorbed dose estimates to nine source organs, total body, the GI tract, gonads and red bone marrow were calculated for humans using the physical decay data for 123I. The critical organ was found to be the lower large intestine which received 1.1 rad/mCi of the administered dose. The total-body dose was 63 mrad/mCi. The data indicate that [123I]SCH 23982 should be a suitable agent for imaging the D-1 dopamine receptor in the human brain by single photon emission computed tomography.\r"

Dual tracer quantitative wholebody autoradiography (QARG) with DMIPP and 2-[14C(U)]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) or with FDG and 201Tl enabled comparison of the uptake of a fatty acid and a glucose analog with the blood flow. These comparisons were carried out at the onset and mid-stage of the disease before congestive failure developed. Groups of CM and normal animals were treated with verapamil from the age of 26 days, before the onset of the disease for 41 days. In CM hearts, areas of decreased DMIPP uptake were seen. These areas were much larger than the decrease in uptake of FDG or 201Tl. In early CM only minimal changes in FDG or 201Tl uptake were observed as compared to controls. Treatment of CM-prone animals with verapamil prevented any changes in DMIPP, FDG, or 201Tl uptake. DMIPP seems to be a more sensitive indicator of early cardiomyopathic changes as compared to 201Tl or FDG. The trial of DMIPP and SPECT in the diagnosis of human disease, as well as for monitoring the effects of drugs which may prevent it seems to be warranted.\r"

Panels included an average of five tests (range three to 11). Panel prices ranged from $25 to $189. The three tests most common in the available panels were those for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and uric acid level. A panel combining these three tests would have a positive predictive value of only 34.6% in identifying rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or gout in a population with joint pain, in which the combined prevalence of these diseases is estimated to be 10%. Therefore, 65.4% of persons with a \"positive\" test would not have one of these three rheumatic diseases. Lack of independence between diseases and second tests (for example, positive antinuclear antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis) increases misclassification errors. A careful history and physical examination along with serial ordering of a few selected tests appear optimal to establish a clinical diagnosis of a rheumatic disease.\r"

The probability of survival was 67% six months after the diagnosis of AIDS and 32% at 12 months. As shown by multivariate Cox regression analysis, survivals were shorter (p less than 0.01) in patients 35 years old or older and in those who had anemia when AIDS was diagnosed. In patients with neither of these poor prognostic factors, the 12-month survival was 64%; in patients with one factor, it was 22%; and in patients with both factors, 0%. The prognostic significance of these two factors was validated in a second inception cohort of 50 patients (Group II): in patients with zero, one, and two poor prognostic factors, the 12-month survivals were 80%, 58%, and 26%, respectively. Other poor prognostic factors in Group I included disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and the development of new opportunistic infections or neoplasms. The authors conclude that clinically important prognostic factors can be identified in AIDS patients. These findings should be considered in planning therapeutic trials and in counseling patients.\r"

Development of a positive CRP reaction was also studied in 40 cases of acute epiglottitis. Beyond the neonatal age, an increased CRP value (greater than or equal to 20 mg/L) was found in 60 of 64 (94%) children with a positive blood culture for bacteria or fungus. By contrast, CRP remained below this value in 56 of 73 (77%) with viral infections. The immunologic status did not influence the CRP response. However, time had a highly significant (p less than 0.001) effect on CRP; a history of 6 to 12 hours of illness was required before CRP increased above normal. We conclude that CRP is a sensitive and rapidly reacting index in bacteremic infections. However, because other factors than septicemia also increase CRP, we deem a negative CRP value most informative; if two determinations taken several hours apart are less than 20 mg/L, the patient is very unlikely to have invasive bacterial infection.\r"

Treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a significant decrease in BAL elastase activity but no change in fibronectin, albumin, or alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor concentrations. In contrast, treatment with indomethacin was associated with an increase in BAL elastase activity and fibronectin concentration, with no change in albumin or alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor concentrations. Control groups showed no changes in these BAL fluid biochemical markers during a similar time period. These data indicate that treatment with corticosteroids decreases lung inflammation as measured by BAL elastase activity. Corticosteroid treatment may not inhibit the development of pulmonary fibrosis, because fibronectin concentrations in BAL fluid were unaffected. Indomethacin treatment may augment lung inflammation and fibrosis by increasing BAL elastase activity and fibronectin concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Apparent intracellular free Ca++ concentration [(Ca++]i) was measured in differentiated N1E-115 neuroblastoma by microinjecting cells with aequorin (estimated intracellular concentration, 4 microM) and measuring light emission. Histamine produced a transient, dose-dependent increase in [Ca++]i. Pyrilamine blocked completely the response to histamine whereas cimetidine had no effect. Omitting Ca++ from the external medium reversibly blocked the response. As well as a rise in [Ca++]i, histamine caused a concomitant cell hyperpolarization that was not blocked by ouabain, low Cl-, tetraethylammonium chloride/tetradotoxin or metiamide but was blocked by apamin and pyrilamine. A secondary small depolarization caused by histamine was also blocked by apamin but not by ouabain, low Cl- or tetraethylammonium chloride/tetrodotoxin. Direct iontophoretic injection of Ca++ into cells caused only hyperpolarization. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [IP3(1,4,5)] caused an increase in [Ca++]i and rapid hyperpolarization. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate [IP3(1,3,4)] caused an increase in [Ca++]i, rapid hyperpolarization and a slower depolarization. Repeated injections of IP3(1,3,4) led to a diminished [Ca++]i response and decreased hyperpolarization but had no effect on depolarization. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was without effect on [Ca++]i or on cellular membrane potential. The results suggest that histamine causes an H1 receptor-dependent increase in [Ca++]i, probably by the increased entry of extracellular Ca++, although there may be a contribution from intracellular Ca++ released by IP3(1,4,5). The increase in [Ca++]i activates K+ channels leading to cell hyperpolarization. IP3(1,3,4) formed from inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, which is itself a product of IP3(1,4,5), causes a slower depolarization by a mechanism that does not involve Na+ channels or an increase in [Ca++]i.\r"

The rate of spontaneous impulse generation diminished in the presence of carbachol; complete inhibition (arrest) occurred at 10(-6) M. The hyperpolarization and negative chronotropic effect of carbachol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) were prevented by pretreatment of chicks with islet activating protein. Treatment with islet activating protein, which inactivates the guanine nucleotide binding proteins Gi and Go unmasked \"stimulant\" effects at high (greater than or equal to 10(-5) M) concentrations of carbachol. The stimulant effects included membrane depolarization and an acceleration of spontaneous impulse generation detected at 10(-5) and 10(-4) M carbachol, respectively. Because the depolarization and acceleration produced by carbachol occurred in the presence of propranolol, they are independent of endogenous catecholamines. As with the inhibition of the SA node, the stimulation by carbachol was mediated by muscarinic receptors and prevented by atropine. We speculate that the depolarization of SA node cells by carbachol, as in left atrium, may be mediated by products of phosphoinositide metabolism because phosphoinositide hydrolysis is activated at the same concentrations (greater than or equal to 10(-5) M). The ionic mechanism for the carbachol-induced depolarization and acceleration in SA node cells is not known. By analogy with results in left atrial cells from islet activating protein-treated animals, the mechanism would involve an increased intracellular Na+ activity and stimulation of Na-Ca exchange.\r"

Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, cardiac output (thermodilution technique) and regional blood flow (directional pulsed Doppler velocimetry) were monitored after i.v. or i.c.v. administration of CGRP. Systemic administration of CGRP (0.1-10 nmol/kg i.v.) decreased MAP and increased heart rate in a dose-related manner. Cardiac output increased (+95 +/- 16 ml/min/kg, P less than .01) after the 1-nmol/kg dose. At the lower or higher doses, CGRP produced no consistent changes in cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance was decreased significantly at the doses of 1 and 10 nmol/kg of CGRP. The CGRP i.v. doses of 1 and 10 nmol/kg increased mesenteric and hindquarter blood flow to a maximum of +23 +/- 7 and +30 +/- 6%, respectively (P less than .01). An increase in renal blood flow (+19 +/- 6%, P less than .05) and a decrease in renal resistance (-15 +/- 4%, P less than .05) were produced by the 0.1-nmol/kg dose of CGRP which had no effect on MAP; higher doses of CGRP tended to decrease renal blood flow. The resistance in all vascular beds was decreased by the CGRP doses of 1 and 10 nmol/kg. The maximum decreases in mesenteric, renal and hindquarter vascular resistance after the 10-nmol/kg dose were -53 +/- 3, -42 +/- 5 and -48 +/- 4%, respectively (P less than .01). The hypotensive and vasodilator responses to CGRP i.v. were significantly magnified, and the tachycardia produced by CGRP was attenuated in the sinoaortic denervated rats. Atropine (muscarinic blockers), propranolol (beta adrenoceptor blocker), cimetidine and pyrilamine (histamine H1 and H2 blockers), indomethacin (prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor), BN52021 (platelet activating factor antagonist) or a substance P antagonist had no effect on the cardiovascular responses elicited by systemic CGRP. CGRP, i.c.v. (0.1-10 nmol/kg), induced a modest tachycardia in both intact and sinoaortic denervated rats, but was devoid of any other cardiovascular effects. The results indicate that CGRP is a potent vasodilator of mesenteric, renal and hindquarter skeletal muscle blood vessels in the conscious rat. The hypotensive and vasodilator actions of circulating CGRP are likely to be mediated by direct peripheral interaction with CGRP receptors on vascular smooth muscle, whereas its tachycardic effect seems to involve reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

A combined clinicopathological classification of vasculitis with emphasis on the predominant size of vessels affected (Table 1) is recommended.

This association was investigated further by assessing the ability of antiarthritic agents to modulate variables of macrophage activation in direct comparison to effects on the arthritic lesion. Whereas indomethacin effectively reduced hindpaw edema, it had no significant effect on Ia expression or on any measurement of activation. Prednisolone inhibited hindpaw edema and the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by splenic macrophages. Only methotrexate inhibited hindpaw edema and all variables of macrophage activation (PGE2 and IL-1 production, cyanine dye accumulation) as well as the influx of Ia positive macrophages into synovial tissue.\r"

The culture supernatant of phytohemagglutinin stimulated SLE leukocytes had diminished activity to support the multipotent colony formation. These results suggest that the hematologic abnormalities in SLE occur at the multipotent stem cell level. The T cell mediated suppression of hemopoietic progenitor cells and the diminished activity of humoral factors released from SLE leukocytes may play some role in the pathogenesis of hematologic abnormalities in SLE.\r"

In a feasibility study, thrice weekly plasmapheresis was initiated in the 19th week of gestation to remove antibodies from the maternal circulation in advance of major placental transport to the developing fetus.

In 49 patients with AS and 23 controls, we determined the frequencies of restriction fragment length polymorphisms linked to genes encoding the TcR alpha and beta chain constant regions. There was no significant difference between patients with AS and controls with respect to the frequencies of possible TcR genotypes.

These results suggest that in vivo honey bee venom treatment affects the production of IL-1 by macrophages directly.

This synergy was dependent on Lyt-2+ T cells, since therapeutic effects were abrogated in Lyt-2-depleted mice. The alpha-IFN and IL-2 combination was also synergistic with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in mediating the reduction of established lung metastases.

When cocultured with autologous tumor cells, LGL released soluble cytotoxic factor(s), large granular lymphocyte-derived cytotoxic factor (LGL-CF). In contrast, small T lymphocytes were unable to kill autologous tumor cells or to produce a cytotoxic factor. The LGL-CF demonstrated cytotoxicity against autologous fresh tumor cells but also against allogeneic fresh tumor cells in a 48-hour microcytotoxicity assay and in an 18-hour 51Cr-release assay in the presence of dactinomycin. Binding of LGL-CF to autologous tumor cells occurred within 2 hours and reached the maximum by 6 hours; this binding was sufficient to cause subsequent lysis of the target cells without the continued presence of LGL-CF. Neither the supernatants produced by culture of LGL alone nor the lysates of LGL had detectable cytolytic activity. In addition, treatment of LGL with cytochalasin A inhibited both direct cell-mediated autologous tumor lysis and generation of LGL-CF. Production of LGL-CF required active cell metabolism and protein and RNA syntheses in LGL, but not DNA synthesis. Addition of dactinomycin to LGL-CF in assays augmented the lysis. LGL-CF was stable at 56 degrees C, but it was reduced at 70 degrees C and destroyed at 100 degrees C. Treatment of LGL-CF with trypsin or proteinase K reduced or abrogated the lytic effect, respectively, while the lytic effect was not affected by papain, catalase, or superoxide dismutase. These results indicate that during interaction with autologous tumor cells, LGL release a soluble cytotoxic factor that mediates lysis of fresh human tumor cells.\r"

Among the 62 patients having CABG, unstable angina had been present in 36 (58%), left main coronary artery disease in 21 (34%), and both unstable angina and left main coronary artery disease in 13 (21%). Indications for carotid surgery included previous stroke, amaurosis fugax, or hemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 33 patients (52%); bilaterally significant carotid disease was noted in 48% of the patients. Major neurologic complications occurred in three patients (4.8%), including perioperative stroke in two (3.2%) (fatal in one) and a TIA in a third patient. Bilateral carotid lesions, a contralateral total carotid occlusion, previous cerebrovascular symptoms, and intraaortic balloon pump support did not increase neurologic risk. Seven patients died postoperatively (11%). The mortality rate was 2.8% in patients younger than 65 years vs 22% in patients 65 years or older, 19% in patients with left main coronary artery disease vs 7.3% in patients without, 13.3% in men vs 5.6% in women, 25% in patients with a history of congestive heart failure vs 7.8% in patients without failure, and 6.2% in patients with unilateral carotid disease, 17% in patients with bilateral carotid disease, and 23% in patients with bilateral disease including a contralateral carotid occlusion.

Recurrences in eight patients with repeated treatment \"failures\" were more effectively suppressed with higher doses of acyclovir. All patients experienced recurrent infections after the treatments were completed; however, the mean time to recurrence following each treatment period became progressively longer, and resumption of suppressive therapy was no longer warranted for ten patients. These data indicate the efficacy and safety of chronic suppressive therapy with acyclovir and the value of interrupting prolonged treatment to assess its further need.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) exerts a number of biologic actions upon cultured glomerular mesangial cells (MC). These include stimulation of cellular proliferation and induction of prostaglandin and type IV collagenase secretion. It was determined that this activity, as with other polypeptide growth factors, was associated with the activation of specific MC plasma membrane protein kinases. Plasma membranes from cycling MC were incubated with purified IL-1 and (32P) ATP in the absence of calcium and cyclic nucleotides. Macrophage IL-1 stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of several plasma membrane proteins, the most significant of which were 52-55 kd, 46 kd, and 20 kd in size. Macrophage IL-1 induced specific membrane phosphorylation in concentrations as low as 1.5 x 10(-12) M, an effect obtained with equivalent concentrations of purified MC IL-1. The 46 kd phosphoprotein, which was the most prominent, was alkali-resistant and contained phosphotyrosine when examined by phosphoamino acid analysis. The 52-55 kd and 20 kd phosphoproteins were alkali-labile and contained phosphoserine. The 46 kd phosphoprotein was the major phosphoprotein recovered from Con A-Sepharose and IL-1 affinity columns. Induction of plasma membrane-associated protein kinase activity may represent one mechanism whereby IL-1 initiates mesangial cellular activation.\r"

Of these patients, 83 had angiodysplasia and 10 had the Osler-Weber-Rendu (OWR) syndrome. The median age in each of these groups was 70 and 63 years, respectively. Cardiovascular disease, especially valvular disease, was common. A poor correlation existed between the results of endoscopically identified VMs and visceral angiography in patients with angiodysplasia. A combination of upper and lower gastrointestinal VMs was found in 11% of patients with angiodysplasia and 60% of those with the OWR syndrome. All identified VMs were completely obliterated by photocoagulation with use of a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Bleeding was successfully controlled in 9 patients with the OWR syndrome and in 72 patients with angiodysplasia (range of follow-up, 1 to 39 months). In 243 laser treatments, 3 perforations and 5 episodes of delayed bleeding occurred. This experience demonstrates that extended upper endoscopy is useful in identifying VMs and that gastrointestinal bleeding from VMs can be safely and successfully controlled with use of endoscopic Nd:YAG laser therapy.\r"

To determine the effect of specific bacteria on the presence and nature of tonsillar hypertrophy (measured both clinically and by tonsil weight), quantitative aerobic bacteriology was performed on 54 tonsil-core specimens from 54 children undergoing tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. Twelve tonsil-core biopsies from 12 children with no history of tonsil disease served as controls. Haemophilus influenzae (HI), Streptococcus pyogenes (SP), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn), and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were the most common microorganisms cultured from diseased tonsils. Few bacteria were cultured from the cores of controls. HI was cultured as the dominant aerobic bacteria in 15 of 54 tonsils (27%). For HI alone, the number of bacteria/gram tonsil showed a significant positive correlation to tonsil weight (p less than 0.05). Fourteen of 15 (94%) tonsils with HI were found in patients with clinical tonsillar hypertrophy, while only 6 of 10 patients (60%) with SP and SPn had tonsillar hypertrophy. Of the 38 tonsils removed for obstructive symptoms (clinical hypertrophy), 14 of 38 (37%) cultured HI as the dominant microorganisms, whereas only 6 of 38 (16%) cultured SP. Neither the type of HI (b vs. non-b) nor the presence of beta-lactamase production had a significant correlation to tonsil weight, bacterial load or the number of B- or T-cell subsets. The number of T-helper (Th), T-suppressor (Ts) and B-cells (per gram/tonsil) was markedly greater in all diseased tonsils than in controls. For both HI and SP the total number of bacteria/gram tonsil correlated positively to the number of Ts cells (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.007, respectively). In patients with HI type b (HI-b), the tonsil weight correlated to an increase in Ts and B-cells (p less than 0.004 and p less than 0.007, respectively). An increased presence of the Ts and B-cells in the HI-b tonsils (and not in tonsils with HI non-b) suggests a differential response by the tonsil to these distinct but related bacteria. The above data strongly support an etiological role for HI in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children. Alterations in the relationship between Th and Ts cells may affect normal B-cell function and be implicated in this phenomenon. Clinical implications for pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and future directions for research are discussed.\r"

The current experiments involve transposed nerve-muscle pedicles used to selectively reinnervate larynges which were denervated, entirely detached from the animal except for their vascular supply, and then reimplanted. These pedicles were later stimulated using a potentially implantable \"pacing unit.\" It was possible to selectively control the critical functions of the larynx, using as stimuli physiological events that are preserved even when the vocal folds are paralyzed or uncoordinated. Although laryngeal transplantation in humans remains theoretical, these studies show that it could be feasible in the future.\r"

HLA-DR-expressing macrophages wrapping myelinated fibers were prominent in primary demyelinating neuropathies. T-cells were found in 6 out of 15 nerves examined.

From 1984 to 1986 the prevalence of HIV infection increased from 6.4 percent to 8.7 percent. Over the two years there was a cumulative incidence of new HIV infection of 3.2 percent. The prevalence was higher among women (16.9 percent) and men (9.3 percent) under the age of 30 than among women (9.0 percent) and men (6.2 percent) over 30. Prevalence rates were similar among physicians (5.6 percent), laboratory workers (2.9 percent), and clerical workers (7.9 percent), but they were higher among female nurses (11.4 percent) and manual workers (11.8 percent). Despite marked differences in the intensity of nosocomial exposure, female nurses had similar infection rates on the female internal medicine ward (9.9 percent), in pediatrics (10.8 percent), and in the delivery room (10.7 percent). The attributable risk of HIV infection from a transfusion was 5.9 percent. Neither medical injections nor scarification was a risk factor for HIV infection. Of the 101 seropositive asymptomatic employees in the 1984 survey, 16 percent had AIDS-related complex, 3 percent had AIDS, and 12 percent had died of AIDS by 1986. Previous studies have revealed a seroprevalence of 8.4 percent among women attending an antenatal clinic near the hospital in 1984 and 1986, and of 5.8 percent (in 1984) and 6.5 percent (in 1986) among men donating blood at the hospital's blood bank. We conclude that there is a continuing high prevalence of HIV infection among hospital workers in Kinshasa, Zaire, which appears to be representative of that in the community and not nosocomial.\r"

  ".W": "The final step in aldosterone biosynthesis, an oxidation at position 18 of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, is catalyzed by an enzymatic activity termed corticosterone methyl oxidase II (CMO II). This activity is mediated in vitro by P450c11 (steroid 11-hydroxylase), a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that also catalyzes the preceding two steps of 11-hydroxylation and 18-hydroxylation. CMO II deficiency, an inherited defect in the 18-oxidation step, impairs aldosterone biosynthesis and thus leads to a clinical syndrome of salt wasting. To test the hypothesis that CMO II deficiency results from a mutation affecting the structural gene for P450c11, we examined 11 affected and 21 unaffected members of six families with this disorder. After DNA samples were digested with the restriction endonuclease MspI (thereby cutting the DNA at specific sites) and hybridized with a P450c11 DNA probe, a unique DNA fragment in the P450c11 structural gene was detected in subjects with the deficiency. The DNA fragment and the disease trait were inherited together in each family, demonstrating that CMO II deficiency is caused by a mutation in or very near the structural gene for P450c11 on chromosome 8. We conclude that the metabolic diseases of CMO II and 11-hydroxylase deficiency, which have distinct clinical symptoms, may be caused by different mutations in the single gene for a multifunctional enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian sympathetic neurons in vivo may express either a noradrenergic or cholinergic phenotype. In view of the opposing effect of noradrenaline and acetylcholine on most autonomic target organs, the target-appropriate expression of neurotransmitter is critical. We have examined the maturation of the sympathetic innervation of rat sweat glands to define the developmental mechanisms regulating neurotransmitter choice in vivo. Eccrine sweat glands and their sympathetic innervation develop together postnatally in the rat. Early postnatal innervation expresses only noradrenergic properties, but as the glands and their innervation mature, noradrenergic properties decrease dramatically and cholinergic features appear in the same population of neurons. To investigate the role of the sweat gland in this change we have used a transplantation paradigm which allows sweat glands to be innervated by sympathetic neurons that would normally innervate noradrenergic target organs and remain noradrenergic throughout life. We observe that the sympathetic neurons that innervate the novel cholinergic target alter their neurotransmitter properties and develop a cholinergic phenotype. These results indicate that target organs are able to induce appropriate neurotransmitter traits in the neurons that innervate them.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical manifestations of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) often include neuropsychiatric and neurological deficits, including early memory loss and progressive dementia. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the aetiological agent of AIDS, is probably carried by infected macrophages in the central nervous system. The virus enters cells by binding its envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 antigen present on brain and immune cells. From the data reported in this paper, we now suggest that the neuronal deficits associated with HIV may not be entirely a result of infectivity, but that gp120 shed from HIV could directly produce the neuropathology as a result of its interference with endogenous neurotrophic substances. It is known that an analogue of a sequence contained in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) occurs in all known sequenced gp120 isolates and that VIP is important for neuronal survival in cell culture. Here we show that purified gp120 from two diverse HIV isolates and a recombinant gp120 from a third isolate were all potent in specifically producing significant neuronal cell death in dissociated hippocampal cultures derived from fetal mice, and that this could be reduced by monoclonal antibodies against the murine CD4 antigen and completely antagonized by VIP.\r"

Mature peripheral T cells, however, strongly express the TCR complex and are positive for either CD4 or CD8. Nevertheless, a small percentage of peripheral CD3+ T cells express CD4 and CD8 simultaneously. These mature, double positive cells could be intermediates between CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and mature, single positive T cells, or they may originate from single positive T cells that acquire either CD4 or CD8. Here we report that activation and culturing of cloned CD4+ T cells in interleukin-4 (IL-4), results in the acquisition of CD8 due to its de novo synthesis. The IL-4-induced co-expression of CD8 on CD4+ T cells is reversible, in that CD8 disappeared from double positive T-cell clones isolated in IL-4, when they were cultured in IL-2. CD8 induced by IL-4 can be functional as a monoclonal antibody to CD8 inhibited anti-CD3-mediated cytotoxicity by a double positive T-cell clone.\r"

CD4 and CD8 molecules expressed on the surface of T cells bind to nonpolymorphic portions of class II and class I MHC molecules and assist the TCR in binding and possibly in signalling. The analysis of T-cell development in TCR transgenic mice has shown that the CD4/CD8 phenotype of T cells is determined by the interaction of the alpha beta TCR expressed on immature CD4+8+ thymocytes with polymorphic domains of thymic MHC molecules in the absence of nominal antigen. Here we provide direct evidence that positive selection of antigen-specific, class I MHC-restricted CD4-8+ T cells in the thymus requires the specific interaction of the alpha beta TCR with the restricting class I MHC molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Two evolutionarily distinct families of human retroviruses, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and the human T-cell leukaemia viruses (HTLV), have been defined (reviewed in ref. 1). Although these virus groups share tropism for human CD4+ T cells, they differ markedly in primary sequence, genetic organization and disease association (AIDS versus adult T-cell leukaemia), but show similar general strategies for the regulation of viral gene expression. Each encodes a protein able to trans-activate transcription from the homologous viral long terminal repeat (tat in HIV, tax in HTLV), although these proteins act by different mechanisms and do not appear to be interchangeable. Each virus also produces a second trans-acting protein that induces the expression of the unspliced messenger RNAs encoding the viral structural proteins (rev in HIV and rex in HTLV). Here we show that the rex protein of HTLV-I can functionally replace the rev protein of HIV-1 in transient expression assays. This genetic complementation by rex is adequate for the rescue of a replication-defective rev mutant of HIV-1. This unexpected shared function between the structurally distinct rex and rev proteins emphasizes the importance of this highly conserved pathway for the regulation of human retrovirus gene expression.\r"

VKC patients were evaluated for an average of 18 months using patient reports of symptoms, physicians' observations and assays of sera and tears for total and specific IgE to 10 inhalant allergens common in Israel, including HDMA. Tear and serum samples from a group of 8 patients reacted only with HDMA, and were compared with the tear and serum samples of a group of 11 patients not reacting to any of the above allergens. House dust samples from the homes of two VKC patients in the HDMA-reactive group were examined monthly for a year. While mites were detected throughout the year, they were approximately 3 times more abundant from June through September than at other times. 96.6% of the mites collected belonged to the family Pyroglyphidae; 91.0% were Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and 5.5% Dermatophagoides farinae. Both the severity of VKC symptoms in HDMA-reactive patients and mite population levels peaked simultaneously in the summer. This relationship was not seen among the non-HDMA-reactive patients. Our results suggest that exposure to HDMA plays an important role in the aggravation of VKC symptoms in HDMA-reactive patients.\r"

In unilateral PXF glaucoma, the presence of PXF in the fellow eye was a serious risk factor--a raised intraocular pressure (IOP) developed in almost three quarters of these eyes and glaucoma in nearly one quarter. Because glaucoma developed in one quarter of eyes with ocular hypertension on presentation, careful treatment of this hypertension is indicated. If the IOP was not raised on presentation, it developed in only one of eight eyes, and glaucoma developed in one third of these; therefore, regular follow-up only is necessary. Acute glaucoma was usually open-angle PXF glaucoma. The response to medical treatment though good initially, usually fialed on follow-up. Although laser trabeculoplasty was often effective, usually with medical treatment, surgery was often necessary and usually successful though often with adjuvant medical treatment.\r"

Some evidence of visual dysfunction was observed in 37.8% of the diabetics with no retinopathy and 60.0% of the diabetics with background retinopathy. Although significant hue discrimination and contrast sensitivity deficits were observed in both groups of diabetic patients, contrast sensitivity was abnormal more frequently than hue discrimination. However, only 5.4% of the diabetics with no retinopathy and 10.0% of the diabetics with background retinopathy exhibited both abnormal hue discrimination and abnormal contrast sensitivity. Contrary to previous reports, blue-yellow (B-Y) and red-green (R-G) hue discrimination deficits were observed with approximately equal frequency. In the diabetic group, contrast sensitivity was reduced at all spatial frequencies tested, but for individual diabetic patients, significant deficits were only evident for the mid-range spatial frequencies. Among diabetic patients, the hue discrimination deficits, but not the contrast sensitivity abnormalities, were correlated with the patients' hemoglobin A1 level. A negative correlation between contrast sensitivity at 6.0 cpd and the duration of diabetes also was observed.\r"

Predictive of a good visual outcome (greater than or equal to 20/40) were: (1) initial visual acuity better than 20/40 and (2) the need for only one or two operations in the treatment of the injury. Predictive of a poor visual outcome (less than 5/200) were: (1) initial visual acuity worse than 5/200 and (2) a wound 4 mm or longer in length, independent of wound location. The visual outcome in this series of patients was compared with other large series of intraocular foreign bodies reported before the development of vitreous microsurgical techniques. The percentage of patients with a visual outcome of 20/40 or better has remained the same, whereas the incidence of enucleation has diminished.\r"

After an adequate trial of NSAIDs in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, the physician would usually add either a slow-acting remittive drug or an antimalarial. If the response to these drugs is unsatisfactory, or they have lost their effectiveness, then a cytotoxic drug would be considered for RA. With major organ involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus or with vasculitis (polymyalgia rheumatica/temporal arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa), corticosteroids would play an important role. Cytotoxic drugs are being used with increased frequency in conditions that may be refractory to steroids, such as polyarteritis or Wegener's granulomatosis, and when the side effects of high dose steroids are becoming intolerable. Whichever drug is chosen, careful instruction to the patient and follow-up of that patient for side effects are essential.\r"

Children with hemophilia-associated AIDS were older than other children with AIDS (medians 13 and 1 years, respectively) and less frequently had lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (5% v 48%) but had similar incidences of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (51% v 53%) and similar case to fatality ratios (59% v 61%). Children with hemophilia-associated AIDS had P carinii pneumonia significantly less often than did adults with hemophilia-associated AIDS, but both had similar case to fatality ratios (adults 72% with P carinii pneumonia, 68% dead). Significantly more hemophilic children than adults with AIDS were nonwhite (30% v 14%) and resided in the tristate area of New York/New Jersey/Pennsylvania (43% v 25%). The immune effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to date on asymptomatic pediatric and adult hemophiliacs are similar but may be more severe in adults. It is concluded that, although some of the clinical manifestations of AIDS (eg, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis) occurring or not occurring in older children infected through blood factor products differ from those of other children with AIDS, disease outcome to date is equally poor. The reasons for the differences between hemophilic children and hemophilic adults with and without AIDS warrant further investigation.\r"

PRP vaccine was given to 36 children and a diphtheria toxoid conjugated vaccine, PRP-D, was given to 36. Coded pre- and postvaccine sera were tested by radioimmunoassay for anti-PRP antibody. The groups did not differ in age distribution or type of sickle hemoglobinopathy. Preexisting antibody levels were low in both vaccine groups; 65% were less than 0.15 microgram/mL. The vaccines were safe but associated with frequent minor reactions. PRP-D gave higher geometric mean titers and mean fold titer increase than PRP in all children (15.58 micrograms/mL [234-fold] v 2.63 micrograms/mL [29-fold]) and in the subgroups 1.5 to 2.5 years of age or with pretiter values less than 0.15 microgram/mL. Titers for 64% of children receiving PRP and 94% receiving PRP-D were greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/mL. Thus, both vaccines were useful in this population, but PRP-D was more immunogenic. Duration of antibody levels postvaccination, booster responses, and PRP-D immunogenicity in younger children with sickle cell syndromes all require further study.\r"

Using the human IL-6 cDNA as a probe, we have isolated functional cDNA clones from mouse bone marrow stromal cell cDNA libraries. Sequence analysis of the mouse cDNA insert revealed significant homology between the human and mouse IL-6 cDNA clones both at the level of nucleotide (65%) and deduced amino acid (41%) sequences. The NH2-terminal sequence of the deduced protein is identical to a partial NH2-terminal sequence determined previously for a hybridoma/plasmacytoma growth factor and a plasmacytoma growth factor isolated from mouse T cells and macrophages, respectively. The mRNA for mouse IL-6 is expressed in IL-1-treated stromal cells and in activated T-cell and macrophage cell lines. Supernatants from COS-7 monkey cells transfected with the cDNA clone have plasmacytoma growth factor, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, and colony-stimulating factor activities, as well as the ability to support the growth of a factor-dependent myeloid cell line, thus revealing an additional biological activity for IL-6.\r"

A clone with the largest cDNA insert of 2664 base pairs (bp) was analyzed for its complete nucleotide sequence. It contained 202 bp of a 5' untranslated region, 45 bp of coding for a signal peptide (15 amino acid residues), 2019 bp for complement component C1s zymogen (673 amino acid residues), 378 bp for a 3' untranslated region, a stop codon, and 17 bp of a poly(A) tail. The amino acid sequence of C1s was 40.5% identical to that of C1r, with excellent matches of tentative disulfide bond locations conserving the overall domain structure of C1r. DNA blotting and sequencing analyses of genomic DNA and of an isolated genomic DNA clone clearly showed that the human genes for C1r and C1s are closely located in a \"tail-to-tail\" arrangement at a distance of about 9.5 kilobases. Furthermore, RNA blot analyses showed that both C1r and C1s genes are primarily expressed in liver, whereas most other tissues expressed both C1r and C1s genes at much lower levels (less than 10% of that in liver). Multiple molecular sizes of specific mRNAs were observed in the RNA blot analyses for both C1r and C1s, indicating that alternative RNA processing(s), likely an alternative polyadenylylation, might take place for both genes.\r"

  ".U": "89017188\r", 
  ".W": "Studies presented here demonstrate that individually expanded clones of murine Ly-1 B cells, perhaps analogous to the expanded neoplastic Leu-1 B-cell clones in human chronic lymphocytic leukemias, are universally detectable in young New Zealand Black (NZB)-related autoimmune mice and in senescent normal mice (greater than 18 months old). These clones are visible as phenotypically homogeneous cell populations in multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of peritoneal and splenic B cells; they show unique immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangements in Southern gel analyses of peritoneal and splenic DNA; and, like the self-replenishing Ly-1 B-cell population from which they are drawn, they tend to grow readily in irradiated or unirradiated syngeneic or allotype congenic hosts. Furthermore, they develop and generalize in primary and secondary hosts in a characteristic pattern (peritoneum much greater than spleen greater than lymph node greater than bone marrow) that suggests that their initial growth is controlled by the mechanisms that normally control Ly-1 B-cell distribution in lymphoid organs. The universal emergence of these clones within the Ly-1 B-cell lineage may be explained by the substantially greater opportunity for hyperplastic and neoplastic transformation events in this long-lived self-replenishing Ly-1 B-cell population, which must divide relatively frequently to maintain its normal size throughout adulthood. Repeated exposure to internal or environmental antigens (with which Ly-1 B cells are known to react) may also play a role in driving the development of these clones.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated the effect of neonatal administration of mouse prolactin (PRL) antiserum on the developmental expression of T- and B-lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of female BALB/c mice. Newborn female mice were injected subcutaneously with a 50-microliters aliquot of PRL antiserum or normal rabbit serum on days 1, 2, and 3. On neonatal day 5, the PRL antiserum-treated group had a significantly (P less than 0.05) increased population of cells in the thymus and the spleen that were positive for Thy-1.2 and for L3T4. Increases in Thy-1.2- and L3T4-positive cells in the thymus were detectable also on days 8 and 14 in mice that received the PRL antiserum and in mice injected with bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist that inhibits PRL release from the anterior pituitary. On neonatal days 21, 28, and 32, there were no significant differences in the percentage of cells positive for Thy-1.2, Ly-2 (formerly Lyt-2), or L3T4 antigens in the thymus. However, there were significant increases in the percentage of Thy-1.2- and L3T4-positive spleen cells in the bromocriptine-treated group at all times monitored and in the PRL antiserum-treated group except on day 14. In addition, the percentage of splenocytes that were positive for IgG was significantly increased in the PRL antiserum-treatment group on days 8-28, although not on neonatal day 32. Of tissues known to contain PRL receptors, neonatal administration of PRL antiserum or bromocriptine resulted in a significant alteration in the wet weight of spleen and liver, with no significant effect in thymus, heart, and kidney. Pituitary implants also resulted in a significant increase in both concanavalin A- and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated thymidine incorporation into murine splenic lymphocytes prepared from 45-day-old female mice. These data extend the role of PRL as an immunomodulator of adult lymphocyte function to a role in the developmental expression of T- and B-lymphocyte populations in the thymus and spleen of mice.\r"

Several base changes were observed in the sequences of the four P-450(C21)B genes as compared to that of the functional B gene. Many of these base changes were identical to those of the P-450(C21)A pseudogene. The three DNAs (P.10-1, P.10-2, and P.3) produced no P-450(C21) activity in a functional assay for P-450(C21) by the COS cell expression system, while the P.7 DNA expressed the activity. The P.10-1 and P.10-2 DNAs were shown to have a point mutation in the second intron, causing aberrant splicing. The P.3 DNA carried three clustered missense mutations in the sixth exon, which impaired P-450(C21) activity. All these critical mutations could be seen in the corresponding site of the P-450(C21)A pseudogene. These data strongly suggest the involvement of gene conversion in this genetic disease.\r"

This protein is able to convert nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabino-furanosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU) to toxic intermediates. The activation of these compounds disrupts cellular DNA replication, leading to rapid cell death. Neither acyclovir, FIAU, nor the herpes thymidine kinase alone is harmful to cells. This approach is simple and should have widespread applicability in studying lineage formation in cultured cells and transgenic animals.\r"

When used with the 5-methylcytosine-sensitive enzyme Hha I, it gives rise to a pattern close to R and T banding on autosomes. In addition, the staining of one X chromosome in females appears very unusual by its pattern and its strong intensity. This procedure, as applied on a case with a polysomy X chromosome, provides direct evidence of an overall hypomethylation of the inactive X chromosomes.\r"

The dimorphic RFLP is defined by the presence of allelic fragments 1.0 kilobase and 0.8 kilobase long. The results of this study show that the two alleles of the PstI RFLP of the placental alkaline phosphatase gene segregate as codominant traits according to Mendelian expectations. For a polymorphism to be useful as a genetic marker the probability that an offspring is informative (PIC) must be at least 0.15. The allelic frequency of the 1.0-kilobase allele is 0.21, which correlates to a probability that an offspring is informative of 0.275 and is indicative of a useful polymorphism. By using probes derived from different regions of the placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA, the mutated Pst I site causing the RFLP was located in the penultimate intron 2497 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional initiation site.\r"

The same TNP-ABCs (which had already processed TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin) formed conjugates with one or the other T helper (TH) cell type, and conjugation was antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex-restricted. The conjugation of a fixed number of one type of TH cell to the TNP-ABCs was inhibited by co-incubation with increasing numbers of cells of the other TH cell type. Thus, the vast majority of TNP-ABCs can conjugate to either type of TH cell. A similar pattern of inhibition of the conjugation of one TH cell type to the TNP-ABCs was seen when cells were co-incubated with increasing numbers of cells from an alloreactive T-cell clone. In all cases, conjugates contained only one T cell bound to one B cell, suggesting that interaction of an antigen-presenting B cell with one TH cell prevents the simultaneous binding of another TH cell.\r"

Genetic diversity among ETs of isolates of the same serotype was, on average, only 67% of that in the total sample, and no ETs were shared among isolates of different serotypes. Cluster analysis of the ETs revealed 2 primary phylogenetic divisions at a genetic distance of 0.66 and 12 major lineages diverging from one another at distances greater than 0.42. In general, strains of different phylogenetic lines or groups of allied lineages have characteristic cap region restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns obtained by digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI. Strains producing serotype c, e, and f capsules have no close relationships to those of other encapsulated strains. Lineages of both serotype a and b strains occur in each primary phylogenetic division, most probably as a result of the transfer of serotype-specific sequences of the cap region between clonal lineages. Serotype a strains allied in division I with a group of abundant serotype b clones and the serotype d strains apparently are more virulent than the serotype a strains in division II, which are related to serotype b and f strains that rarely cause invasive disease.\r"

Thirteen children with normal hearing and 29 children with hearing impairments, ranging in age from 7 to 13 years, were classified into categories based on vestibular function using neuro-otologic measures (ie, vestibulo-ocular reflex function and posturography). Children in each category were tested for motor proficiency using clinical assessment measures (eg, balance, muscle tone, and coordination). The test results indicated that the children with hearing impairments and normal peripheral vestibular function (n = 7) exhibited normal motor proficiency, including balance. The children with hearing impairments and loss of peripheral vestibular sensitivity (n = 19) also demonstrated normal motor proficiency, except for balance ability. The children with hearing impairments and sensory organization deficits (n = 3), however, exhibited motor deficits in many areas. The results of this study indicate that motor proficiency in children with hearing impairments depends on vestibular function. Interventions for motor deficits in children with hearing impairments, therefore, must consider vestibular function as well as motor performance.\r"

Macroscopic clearance of secretions (from purulent to mucoid or mucopurulent) was achieved in all patients, and this was associated with a significant reduction in the average sputum elastase content by week 16 (p less than 0.001) when elastase was only detectable in three of the patients. Lung inflammation was also reduced as reflected in the sputum to serum albumin ratios. In addition patients noted a significant improvement in well being, and breathlessness as well as in sputum colour and volume and there was a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow. After cessation of treatment the time taken for the sputum to become purulent again ranged from 15 days to 10 months (median 2.5 months), which is longer than that seen previously following short courses of antibiotic treatment. Serum levels of the acute phase protein alpha 1 antichymotrypsin fell by week 16, although this failed to reach statistical significance. However, in eight patients where data were available the levels rose significantly after treatment had finished. The concentrations were consistently higher than those seen in healthy controls, and were also elevated in less severely affected patients suggesting that bronchiectasis is always associated with some systemic effect.\r"

EWA is employed with an on-line weighted-acquisition module (WAM) as the data are acquired, rather than as a postprocessing technique. EWA was compared with normal window imaging in patients and in phantoms. For gallium-67 and thallium-201, contrast improved by as much as 40%. A much smaller improvement in contrast was observed with technetium-99m due to its ideal monoenergetic emissions. Single photon emission computed tomographic studies also showed improved contrast and were without artifact. EWA has great promise, and with further development quantitative scatter correction may be possible.\r"

This has raised the possibility that an unusual structure exists in these regions that might be involved in recognition or regulation. Several of these sequences, including d(C-T)n.d(A-G)n, are known to undergo a transition in plasmids to an underwound state that is hypersensitive to single strand-specific nucleases; this transition occurs under conditions of moderately acid pH and negative supercoiling. Chemical probes were used to examine the reactivity of a restriction fragment from a human U1 gene containing the sequence d(C-T)18.d(A-G)18 as a function of supercoiling and pH, and thus analyze the structure in this region. Hyperreactivity was seen in the center and at one end of the (C-T)n tract, and continuously from the center to the same end of the (A-G)n tract, in the presence of supercoiling and pH less than or equal to 6.0. These results provide strong support for a triple-helical model recently proposed for these sequences and are inconsistent with other proposed structures.\r"

Both the Ca2+ increase and DNA fragmentation were prevented in cells treated with the inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, and DNA fragmentation and cell killing were not detected when cells were incubated in a \"Ca2+-free\" medium or pretreated with high concentrations of the calcium probe, quin-2 tetraacetoxymethyl ester. These results indicate that TCDD can kill immature thymocytes by initiating a suicide process similar to that previously described for glucocorticoid hormones.\r"

In this study AIDS-KS-derived cells with characteristic spindle-like morphology were cultured with a growth factor (or factors) released by CD4+ T lymphocytes infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type I or II (HTLV-I or HTLV-II) or with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV-1 or HIV-2). Medium conditioned by HTLV-II-infected, transformed lines of T cells (HTLV-II CM) contained large amounts of this growth activity and also supported the temporary growth of normal vascular endothelial cells, but not fibroblasts. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulated the growth of the KS-derived cells, but the growth was only transient and these could be distinguished from that in HTLV-II CM. Other known endothelial cell growth promoting factors, such as acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and epidermal growth factor, did not support the long-term growth of the AIDS-KS cells. The factor released by CD4+ T cells infected with human retroviruses should prove useful in studies of the pathogenesis of KS.\r"

One approach to therapy involves activation of the host antitumor cellular effector mechanisms. Since monoclonal antibodies to CD3 (anti-CD3) can activate T cells in vitro, an attempt was made to determine if tumor immunity could be achieved by the administration of anti-CD3 in vivo. T lymphocytes from mice injected with anti-CD3 showed increased interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, increased proliferation to recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), and enhanced reactivity in both an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction and a mixed lymphocyte tumor culture. Malignant tumor growth in treated mice was also examined. The anti-CD3 treatment prevented tumor outgrowth that would have killed untreated animals and also stimulated an in vivo response against a malignant progressor tumor providing lasting tumor immunity.\r"

The CD3-zeta chains are either disulfide-linked homodimers (CD3-zeta 2) or disulfide-linked heterodimers with eta (CD3-zeta eta). Variants of a murine antigen-specific T cell hybridoma that express normal amounts of CD3-zeta 2 but decreased amounts of CD3-zeta eta were isolated. When activated, the parental cell line increased both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and serine-specific protein kinase activity to a much greater extent than the variants. In contrast, the activation of a tyrosine-specific kinase after stimulation with a cross-linking antibody to CD3 was similar among these cells. There was a positive linear relation between the expression of CD3-zeta eta and phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by the TCR, suggesting a differential coupling of the T cell alpha beta heterodimer to signal transduction mechanisms due to alpha beta association with either CD3-zeta 2 or CD3-zeta eta.\r"

We reviewed our recent experience during a three and one-half year period with 31 emergency operations performed for gastroduodenal hemorrhage or perforation. Seven patients were convalescing from extensive surgical procedures unrelated to gastroduodenal ulcer disease at the time of hemorrhage or perforation. These complications tended to occur about one week after the initial operation. Six of these seven patients had duodenal ulcer disease; prior ulcer disease or current use of ulcerogenic drugs could be documented in all six. Only one of these seven patients had true stress ulceration. There were 143 patients with active peptic ulcer who underwent an extensive surgical procedure unrelated to ulcer disease. Three of these 143 patients required surgical intervention for complications of ulcer disease during the convalescent period. Our experience suggests that a common setting for emergency operations for peptic ulcer hemorrhage or perforation is during convalescence from an unrelated surgical procedure. A history of peptic ulcer disease or use of ulcerogenic agents should alert the surgeon to the possibility of postoperative hemorrhage or perforation. These complications most commonly reflect chronic duodenal ulcer disease or diathesis and not true stress ulceration.\r"

Large clots obscuring clear viewing are rapidly removed by way of the small gastrotomy, and the proximal hidden corners of the stomach are readily visualized even by a surgeon who lacks previous experience with endoscopic techniques.

Recurrent hemorrhage, defined as upper gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or both, in the course of chronic sclerotherapy was investigated aggressively by means of endoscopy and the findings archived with videotape recording. In 24 patients 51 episodes of recurrent hemorrhage developed in the entire series. On the basis of endoscopic findings and serial comparison of videotape recordings, the most common source of recurrent hemorrhage was the original varices, which accounted for rebleeding in 18 patients. The risk of such bleeding was highest in the first month, diminishing thereafter until total variceal eradication. Rebleeding after eradication of varices was always from sources other than varices, as regenerated vessels were small and infrequent and never the source of bleeding. Continued sclerotherapy ultimately achieved total variceal eradication in 15 of 18 patients with variceal rebleeding. Sclerotherapy alone was successful in eradicating all varices in a total of 38 patients in this series, the mean time required being 13 +/- 4.1 months. Rebleeding from sources not amenable to sclerotherapy was treated with porto-azygos disconnection (6 patients) or distal splenorenal shunts (3 patients). There were 12 deaths: four attributed to hemorrhage (3 after surgery), five from liver failure, and three late deaths from causes not due to liver disease. Recurrent hemorrhage per se during the course of sclerotherapy may not be taken as a sign of treatment failure but must be vigorously investigated, since findings profoundly affect management and outcome.\r"

Victims may demonstrate components of arterial gas embolism, which has a propensity for cerebral involvement, and/or decompression sickness, with primarily spinal cord involvement. Fourteen patients with diving-related barotrauma were studied with MR imaging of the brain and spinal cord and with CT of the brain. In four patients with presumed cerebral gas embolism, cranial MR was abnormal in three patients while CT was abnormal in only one. Twelve patients had decompression sickness and spinal cord symptoms. MR documented spinal cord abnormalities in three patients. However, scans obtained early in our study were frequently limited by technical constraints. MR of the brain is more sensitive than conventional CT scanning techniques in detecting and characterizing foci of cerebral ischemia caused by embolic barotrauma to the CNS. Although spinal MR may be less successful in the localization of spinal cord lesions related to decompression sickness, these lesions were previously undetectable by other neuroimaging methods.\r"

Correlation of coronal T1-weighted spin echo and gradient recalled echo images (the latter with high-signal-intensity vascular structures) proved to be an effective means of identifying cavernous venous spaces, connective tissue and cranial nerves, and the lateral margins of the pituitary gland, and of differentiating tumor tissue from cavernous venous spaces. Further work is needed to develop criteria to distinguish cavernous sinus compression from actual tumor invasion.\r"

Only in the definition of bone erosion or hyperostosis was MR inferior to another method (CT). We conclude that MR should be the initial diagnostic study in patients with symptoms of a parasellar mass, with supplementation when necessary by CT and angiography.\r"

Fat signal was reliably nulled at inversion times of approximately 120-200 msec in all cases, thereby allowing clear detection of all retrobulbar lesions and normal structures on STIR images as markedly hyperintense relative to fat. All lesions were also clearly depicted on SE images; in fact, short repetition time/short echo time SE sequences were at least as useful as STIR images for illustrating anatomic structures and mass lesions, and in a much shorter scanning time. Separation of optic nerve from perioptic subarachnoid space was clear on SE images, but often difficult or impossible on STIR images owing to the relatively high intensity of normal optic nerves on STIR images. The synergism of relaxation prolongation with STIR actually resulted in loss of information, as any ability to separate the effects of T1 from T2 on signal intensity was impossible when STIR was the sole pulse sequence. We believe that more information is obtained with standard SE sequences than with STIR sequences, and therefore SE remains the method of choice for orbital MR imaging.\r"

  ".W": "The place of angiography in the diagnosis of arterial injuries in cases of penetrating wounds of the extremities has been a source of controversy, especially when the injury is in proximity to the artery but there is no clinical evidence of arterial injury. The positive yield of angiography has been reported to be between 6% and 20%, but most angiographers suspect the yield to be lower. The cost of angiography continues to increase. A retrospective analysis was performed in 507 patients with 534 possible arterial injuries associated with wounds near vessels. Thirty-one arteries were considered by the radiologist to have surgically significant injury. Seven patients did not have surgery. On the basis of surgical findings in 24 patients, there was a true-positive angiographic yield of 3.6% as well as five false-positive angiograms. Angiographic sensitivity was 100%, specificity 99%, accuracy 99%, positive predictive value 85%, and negative predictive value 100%. Ten (2.0%) minor angiographic complications and two (0.4%) major complications occurred. There were three surgical complications in negative surgeries. False-positive angiograms can probably be reduced by more circumspect evaluation of minor abnormalities. However, the 3.6% true-positive yield must be balanced against the complications of surgery and angiography and the associated costs. Although delayed diagnosis and therapy of arterial injury are less satisfactory than early repair, angiography of wounds in proximity to major extremity arteries should be reserved for situations in which exclusion of injury is critical to overall management of the patient.\r"

However, there has been a general reluctance to use it or other interventional procedures in any patient with a solitary functioning kidney. We attempted renal angioplasty in 11 patients each of whom had a solitary functioning kidney. All 11 had had either a previous contralateral nephrectomy or an autonephrectomy from chronic arterial occlusion. The patients ranged in age from 42 to 81 years. In nine of the 11 patients, a catheter was negotiated across the stenosis, and the lesion was dilated successfully. In two, the lesion could not be crossed. In the group of nine patients whose lesions were dilated successfully, clinical follow-up (2-180 weeks) revealed that hypertension was cured in four and improved in five. Of the two patients in whom angioplasty was not possible, one required emergency renal bypass surgery and the other had no change in renal status. Renal function test results after the procedure were variable and did not correlate with decreases in blood pressure. We conclude that percutaneous renal angioplasty is a satisfactory alternative to surgery for the treatment of renovascular hypertension or the preservation of renal function in a patient with a solitary functioning kidney.\r"

Examinations included posteroanterior and lateral (n = 154) and shallow oblique (n = 126) chest radiography, linear tomography (n = 80), and chest CT (n = 96). At surgery, a thymoma was found in 26 patients (17%). Plain film findings, which often were subtle, correctly predicted a thymoma in 15 (58%) of 26 patients. CT findings correctly predicted a thymoma in 17 of 20 patients (sensitivity, 85.0%; specificity, 98.7%; and accuracy, 95.8%). CT findings failed to detect a thymoma in three patients because a small tumor was indistinguishable from adjacent thymus (n = 2) and respirator motion artifacts (n = 1). Four (15%) of the tumors were invasive, and three (12%) were calcified. The likelihood of a thymoma increased with increasing age (3% for 20 years old and under, 12% for 21-45 years old, and 35% for 46 years old and older). In the youngest group, the thymus is densely cellular and normally relatively large, and therefore a small thymoma may be hidden. In patients 21-45 years old, partial fatty involution leaves parenchymal islands that can mimic a thymoma or obscure a small tumor. In patients over 45 years old, fatty involution enhances recognition of even small thymic tumors. For all patients with myasthenia gravis, we recommend that the initial chest radiographic examination include posteroanterior, lateral, and shallow (20 degrees) oblique views. For those patients under 21 years old, we recommend chest CT only when local symptoms, signs, or radiographic findings suggest the presence of thymic abnormality. For those patients 21 years old and older, we recommend routine chest CT.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively analyzed benign asbestos-related pleural and parenchymal abnormalities on high-resolution CT scans and correlated them with clinical diagnoses in 100 asbestos-exposed workers. All subjects had high-resolution CT scans in conjunction with conventional CT at the time of clinical evaluation. To evaluate for asbestosis, we ranked high-resolution CT scans as high, intermediate, or low probability of asbestosis on the basis of the multiplicity and extent of observed parenchymal changes. By linear regression analysis, the most distinctive high-resolution CT features of asbestosis included thickened nondependent interstitial short lines and parenchymal bands. In 45 subjects satisfying clinical criteria of asbestosis, high-resolution CT probability of asbestosis was high in 38 (84%), intermediate in five (11%), and low in two (4%). In 20 (36%) of 55 subjects without clinical asbestosis, parenchymal abnormalities indicative of a high probability of asbestosis were observed on high-resolution CT. High-resolution CT probability scores had a strong positive correlation with chest radiographic profusion scores (p less than .0001) and asbestos-related pleural thickening (p less than .0001). Significant inverse correlations were seen with forced vital capacity (p less than .006) and single-breath diffusing capacity (p less than .03), both functional measures of restrictive interstitial lung disease. Neither clubbing nor rales were sufficiently prevalent to have statistical correlation with high-resolution CT scores. High-resolution CT is sensitive in detecting both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in the asbestos-exposed subject. Asbestos-related pleural changes are observed more frequently on high-resolution CT than on conventional CT or chest radiography. The probability of asbestosis based on high-resolution CT parenchymal features has a significant correlation with existing clinical determinants of disease, and high-resolution CT can detect abnormality when other methods are not diagnostic.\r"

However, we have found that even when the lymph nodes are normal in size, the presence of extrathoracic metastases may preclude successful resection. In a series of 263 patients with pathologically proved non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma who were seen over a 2-year period, we identified 95 patients in whom a preoperative CT scan showed only a solitary lung mass without evidence of hilar or mediastinal metastases, pleural effusion, or definite chest-wall involvement. The medical records and preoperative imaging studies were evaluated in this group. Twenty-four (25%) of these patients who had potentially resectable masses proved to have extrathoracic metastases; thus they were not candidates for surgery. Occurring in 16 (67%) of these 24 patients, adenocarcinoma was the most common cell type; squamous cell carcinoma was present in five patients (21%), and large cell carcinoma was present in three patients (13%). These findings suggest that extrathoracic metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma may occur without CT evidence of enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. Such metastases may preclude successful surgical resection.\r"

  ".U": "89022636\r", 
  ".W": "Photodynamic laser therapy is used in the palliation of advanced lung cancer. To minimize the complications of this form of therapy, physicians must evaluate correctly the extent of extraluminal disease. We undertook a study to compare CT and bronchoscopy in the evaluation of extent of disease before laser therapy in 20 patients with complete bronchial obstruction. The relative contribution of intraluminal and extraluminal tumor to the obstruction and its influence on response to therapy was assessed by using both techniques. Adequate response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% relief of the obstruction on bronchoscopy performed within 1 week of therapy and by any improvement of the postobstructive atelectasis and consolidation on follow-up chest radiographs. Nine patients had predominately intraluminal tumor on both CT and bronchoscopy before laser therapy. Eight of these had a bronchoscopic response and radiographic improvement after therapy. Ten patients had predominately extrinsic compression by tumor on CT. Of these, only two had a bronchoscopic response and none had radiographic improvement after treatment. The differences in bronchoscopic and radiographic response between the two groups were significant (p less than .01). In the 10 patients with predominately extraluminal tumor on CT, bronchoscopy agreed with CT in suggesting mainly extrinsic compression in five, but it incorrectly suggested mainly intraluminal tumor in the remaining five. In one patient with a left upper-lobe tumor, the relative intra- and extraluminal components could not be assessed on CT. We conclude that in complete bronchial obstruction, CT is superior to bronchoscopy in evaluating the extent of extrinsic compression by tumor. The presence of predominately extraluminal tumor compression on CT correlates with a poor response to laser therapy.\r"

These biopsies were preceded by 18-, 20-, or 22-gauge aspirations in 42 patients, allowing a direct comparison of the efficacy of the needle types. Specific diagnoses were made by cutting-needle biopsy in 78% (25/32) of patients with nonlymphoproliferative malignancies, in 73% (8/11) with lymphoma or thymoma, and in 54% (7/13) of patients with benign diseases. In those in whom both aspiration and cutting needles were employed, a higher percentage of specific diagnoses was achieved by cutting-needle biopsy than by aspiration biopsy: 72% vs 64% in nonlymphoproliferative malignancies, 62% vs 12% in the lymphoproliferative group, and 55% vs 22% in benign disorders. Complications were encountered in 20% of all patients studied. This study shows that, for selected chest lesions, CT-guided cutting-needle biopsies can be performed safely and are useful, especially in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative or benign disease.\r"

In this report, we review the findings on chest radiographs in eight patients with this complication. Portal hypertension in these patients was evidenced by the presence of esophageal varices and/or ascites. The causes of portal hypertension were liver cirrhosis in seven patients and portal venous thrombosis in one patient. Pulmonary hypertension was established by right heart catheterization and pressure measurement. Qualitative assessment of the radiographs showed that four patients had the classic findings of pulmonary hypertension including prominent central pulmonary arteries and right ventricular enlargement, three had subtle abnormalities, and one had only cardiomegaly. Measurements of the width of the right descending pulmonary artery and the pulmonary lobar diameter/transverse thoracic diameter ratio were made in five of the patients in whom postero-anterior radiographs were available. The results confirmed our qualitative analysis, although they did not establish the diagnosis in borderline cases. We also observed that pulmonary vascular redistribution to the upper lobes was present in four patients, a finding that has been reported in patients with other causes of pulmonary hypertension. We conclude that the possibility of pulmonary hypertension should be raised in patients with portal hypertension, even when only subtle chest radiographic findings are present to suggest that diagnosis.\r"

Dornier HM3 water-bath equipment (Dornier Medical Systems, Marietta, GA) was used in all procedures. All patients had either a T-tube or a nasobiliary, cholecystostomy, or transhepatic biliary drainage tube in place at the time of the lithotripsy. In 12 patients, the indication for ESWL was the failure of or anticipated difficulty with basket extraction of the stones, either via a T-tube tract or by means of endoscopic sphincterotomy. In the other four patients, ESWL was performed immediately after retained stones were found on a postoperative cholangiogram, even though no difficulty was anticipated in removing the stones by means of basket extraction. In 15 (94%) of the 16 patients, the stones were successfully fragmented. The fragments passed spontaneously in nine patients but had to be removed by basket in five patients. In one patient, the fragments could not be extracted by basket. The number of ESWL shocks used in a single session ranged from 525 to 3200. Three patients had two ESWL sessions. No significant complications were observed. ESWL is a successful method for the management of patients with bile duct stones when used in conjunction with other nonsurgical techniques. It was also the only treatment required in 56% of our patients.\r"

Exclusion criteria include patients with (1) more than three stones, (2) stones less than 0.5 cm or more than 3.0 cm in diameter, (3) radiopaque stones, and (4) a nonfunctioning gallbladder. The gallbladder contents in 100 consecutive patients undergoing cholecystectomy were analyzed according to the number, size, and calcium content of the stones as determined by specimen radiographs. Because none of these patients underwent preoperative oral cholecystography, an estimated percentage of functioning gallbladders was taken from the literature. Preoperative symptoms were not considered in determining a patient's eligibility for gallbladder lithotripsy. On the basis of these criteria, we estimated that 85% of our surgical patients would have been excluded from extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy according to the current Food and Drug Administration protocol for the Dornier gallbladder lithotriptor.\r"

These included retrograde hepatic venous opacification on the early bolus scans and a diffusely mottled pattern of hepatic enhancement seen only during the vascular phase of contrast administration. Ancillary CT findings include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, ascites, and intrahepatic perivascular radiolucency. We believe that these CT abnormalities are caused by passive hepatic congestion. This pattern of abnormal hepatic enhancement represents a potential pitfall in the use of dynamic bolus-enhanced CT for the detection of focal hepatic masses. Recognition of passive hepatic congestion as a possible cause of mottled hepatic enhancement on CT may help explain clinical abnormalities of liver function in patients with heart failure and prevent confusion with other disease processes that produce abnormalities of hepatic attenuation.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with disorders of keratinization (ichthyosis in six and Darier disease in one) were treated with 13-cis-retinoic acid and followed with annual skeletal surveys for 4-6 years. Six of the seven patients developed hyperostoses attributable to the retinoid therapy, manifested as multifocal entheseal calcifications or ossifications in both the axial and appendicular skeletons. In general, the earliest appearing hyperostoses became the largest with time, although in some instances, growth ceased at some foci and progressed at others. The severity of skeletal involvement was seemingly independent of dose, and may have been related to the patient's age at time of therapy. Involvement of the spine was earlier and more pronounced than the appendicular involvement, consisting of tiny hyperostoses arising from the corners of the vertebral bodies, primarily in the cervical and thoracic spine; these later matured into either discrete ossific spurs, or focal or flowing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. The most prominent appendicular hyperostoses were at the tendinous or aponeurotic insertions on the calcaneus, were often unilateral or asymmetric when small, and became bilateral with time. Appendicular hyperostoses occurring at locations besides the calcanei were much smaller, often unilateral, and occurred later (generally between the third and fifth years of therapy). Our findings indicate that the earliest hyperostoses occurring in patients with 13-cis-retinoic acid occur in the spine and feet, and become the most prominent with time. Most appendicular hyperostoses occur later, are smaller, and frequently are asymmetric or unilateral.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 225 consecutive pediatric patients who required sedation for CT imaging, we monitored oral and nasal air flow, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and cardiac rate and rhythm before and after the administration of IV Nembutal. In addition, the first 50 patients in this series had blood pressures mechanically monitored at 1-min intervals. There was no significant change in the cardiac rate, rhythm, or blood pressure in any patient. Seventeen episodes (7.5%) of transient oxygen desaturation to 80% of baseline or less occurred after sedation. The patterns of oxygen desaturation in this series can be explained by the following mechanisms: (1) hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia with resultant loss of the CO2 stimulus of respiration (12 patients); (2) upper airway obstruction from pharyngeal muscle relaxation (three patients); (3) a shift in sensitivity of CNS CO2 receptors (one patient); and (4) central apnea (one patient). Oxygen desaturation normalized spontaneously in 14 patients. In two patients, oxygen saturations returned to normal after modification of head position to optimize airway patency. In one patient, mild stimulation was required to interrupt transient apnea. All but one patient in whom desaturation occurred showed oxygen desaturation within the first 5 min after IV sedation. At The Children's Hospital of Denver, IV Nembutal has been used in over 870 pediatric patients. No patient required resuscitation, intubation, or assisted ventilation. Only one patient required prolonged observation, and one patient demonstrated an idiosyncratic hyperactive response. The sedation failure rate was less than 1%. The average dose of sedation was reduced when compared with IM Nembutal because the rapid onset of activity after IV administration allowed titration of dose to patient response.\r"

This test system, composed of a Du Pont Kevlar fiber-front cassette, Quanta fast-detail screen, Cronex 4L film (wide latitude), and additional yttrium filtration (0.1 mm), reduced the radiation dose in neonatal chest radiography by 69% (0.9 vs 2.9 mrad [0.009 vs 0.029 mGy]) as compared with a conventional system without added yttrium filtration; the thyroid dose was reduced by 76% (0.9 vs 3.7 mrad [0.009 vs 0.037 mGy]). The cumulative dose reduction was achieved through a combination of factors, including (1) beam hardening by the added yttrium filter, (2) increased X-ray transmission through the Kevlar cassette, and (3) a fast film-screen combination. Scatter radiation at distances of 1 and 6 ft. (0.3 and 1.8 m) was negligible for both systems. Image sharpness was compared for the conventional system with and without added yttrium filtration and for the Kevlar system with yttrium. Although sharpness of bony detail was unchanged by adding yttrium filtration to the conventional system, a decrease in sharpness was noted with the Kevlar system. Because image sharpness was affected in the test system, we are not using the Kevlar-Cronex 4L system for mobile chest radiography in the neonatal intensive care unit, despite dose reductions. However, further study is recommended to determine if there is a slower film-screen combination with yttrium filtration that will not degrade image sharpness.\r"

The presence or absence of myocardial infarction was determined from either clinical examination results (coronary angiography, ventriculography, and thallium-201 myocardial imaging) or autopsy findings. Of seven patients with inferior infarction, abnormally deep Q waves in lead II, III, or aVF were observed in six, but the duration was greater than 0.04 second in only one (14%). The sensitivity and specificity of inferior infarction criteria based on Q wave amplitude were 86% and 97%, respectively. Of eight patients with anterior infarction, seven (88%) had abnormally deep and wide (greater than or equal to 0.04 second) Q waves in anterior chest leads. The sensitivity and specificity of the infarction criteria based on the amplitude and duration of the Q wave were 75% and 99%, respectively. Of seven patients with lateral infarction, Q waves were observed in lead I, aVL, or both in four patients, and in all of these patients Q waves were wider than 0.04 second. In two patients with both inferior and anterior infarction, Q waves were observed only in leads II, III, and aVF; in only one patient were the Q waves wider than 0.04 second. Thus deep Q waves in lead II, III, or aVF that are not wider than 0.04 second may indicate inferior infarction in children. Q waves in lead I, aVL, and chest leads associated with anterolateral infarction are in most instances deep and wide.\r"

  ".W": "The release of eicosanoids and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from endothelial cells is thought to involve a calcium-dependent step. Using cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells as a model system, we have examined the relation between agonist-induced changes in inositol polyphosphates and calcium levels within the endothelial cells and extracellular calcium on EDRF release. In a superfusion-cascade system, EDRF was detected by the relaxation of a rabbit aortic ring without endothelium suspended beneath a column of cultured endothelial cells. Endothelial cell stimulation by bradykinin or melittin induced dose-dependent relaxation of the bioassay ring. In addition, bradykinin and melittin stimulated an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in fura-2 loaded endothelial cells and an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins[1,4,5]P3) in cells prelabeled with 3H-myoinositol. Bradykinin stimulation produced transient increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3, fura-2 fluorescence and transient EDRF release. Melittin stimulation induced more prolonged release of EDRF from the endothelial cell column, which was correlated with sustained increases in the fura-2 signal and the level of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Omission of calcium from the cell superfusate attenuated, but did not eliminate, bradykinin-induced EDRF release and the calcium transient, whereas the melittin-induced responses were only slightly attenuated. Endothelial cells clearly demonstrate receptor-activation of phospholipase C and release of sequestered calcium from subcellular sites in response to Ins(1,4,5)P3. These results imply that EDRF release is correlated with increased intracellular calcium levels seen in the absence of extracellular calcium. However, sustained release of EDRF does require influx of extracellular calcium via an undefined mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The radioidinated synthetic fatty acid iodine-123 phenylpentadecanoic acid (IPPA) has proven useful in the identification of regional abnormalities of cardiac metabolism in patients with myocardial ischemia. The present study was performed to test the hypothesis that the myocardial distribution and turnover of fatty acids, assessed noninvasively with IPPA, are altered in patients with cardiomyopathy. Nine normal volunteers and 19 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of various etiologies underwent cardiac imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after intravenous injection of IPPA. Apical short-axis and basal short-axis sections were reconstructed and quantitatively analyzed for relative IPPA activity distribution and washout. Patients with congestive cardiomyopathy demonstrated significantly greater heterogeneity of IPPA uptake than normal subjects (maximal percent variation of activity 27 +/- 11 vs 18 +/- 4, p less than 0.01). They also demonstrated a more rapid percent washout rate than control subjects (24 +/- 8 vs 17 +/- 6 for the apical short-axis section, p less than 0.05; 26 +/- 7 vs 18 +/- 5 for the basal short-axis section, p less than 0.01). These abnormalities of fatty acid distribution and turnover were independent of the etiology of the cardiomyopathy. The degree of heterogeneity of IPPA uptake was significantly related to the patients' New York Heart Association functional class (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01). Thus, compared with normal myocardium, the myocardium of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy demonstrates a more heterogeneous distribution of fatty acid uptake, which parallels the clinical severity of the disease. Furthermore, patients with congestive cardiomyopathy demonstrate a more rapid myocardial clearance of the labeled fatty acid, as assessed with SPECT imaging.\r"

At one year of age the patient is clinically well without evidence of malignant lympho-proliferative disease.

Three patients had a decreased serum concentration of at least one subclass of immunoglobulins. All had normal or elevated proportions of circulating B cells but two of them had a decreased proportion of CD4-positive helper-inducer T cells. We consistently found a severely impaired in vitro proliferative lymphocyte response to the plant lectin pokeweed mitogen (PWM). This could not be overcome by using suboptimal or supraoptimal doses of PWM, or by adding recombinant interleukin 2. In vitro PWM-induced IgM production was absent or low in two of the three patients studied and this low production could not be increased by addition of hydrocortisone. T lymphocytes responded normally to the plant lectins phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. T cells preactivated with phytohemagglutinin also normally proliferated in response to interleukin 2. It has previously been shown that lymphocyte activation with PWM involves both B and T cells and proceeds via an alternative pathway. The data thus indicate that patients with Bloom's syndrome have a specific defect in this PWM-induced alternative pathway of lymphocyte activation.\r"

Thirty-nine dialysis patients (group 2) were also retrospectively selected for comparison and matched for age, sex, year of initiation, length of time on dialysis, and presence of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic heart disease at initiation of dialysis. Using life-table analysis, survival probability (with 95% confidence limits) was determined from the time of CABG for group 1 or after an equivalent period of time on dialysis for group 2. Two life-table analyses were performed; one with study end-points of death, withdrawal (renal transplantation, transfer to other dialysis facilities, and reoperation), and alive on dialysis; and a second with identical end points except that noncardiac deaths were treated as withdrawals. Coronary arteriography revealed severe three vessel disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and segmental wall motion abnormalities in most patients. A mean (+/- SD) of 2.56 +/- 0.75 vessels were bypassed with an operative mortality (30 days) of 2.6%. Mean follow-up after CABG in group 1 was 34.9 +/- 30.1 months, and in most patients functional classification improved. Mean follow-up for group 2 was 17.2 +/- 15.2 months.

We were able to examine this possibility using hypertensive ESRD incidence rates in a population with well-characterized prevalence of hypertension and rate of its control. After adjusting rates of hypertensive ESRD for age, sex, and differences in the prevalence of hypertension by race, we found black:white (B:W) relative risk still to be increased. Prevalence estimates for moderate-severe hypertension and differences in the control of hypertension between the two race groups are of insufficient magnitude to explain the increase in adjusted relative risk. This observation provides further support for the possibility that there are racial differences in the susceptibility to renal damage from elevated BP, which may explain increased risk for hypertensive ESRD in blacks, or that hypertension is being erroneously diagnosed as the cause of ESRD in blacks when another cause is present.\r"

The clinical history is by far the most important diagnostic tool and involves clear assessment of the distribution of joint involvement, whether pain is articular or extra-articular, whether a syndrome follows trauma or infection, and the duration of the process. The distribution of involved joints is a major contributor to differential diagnosis but can be misleading unless a skilled physical examination confirms objective synovitis. If present, nodules, which represent localization of the disease process, also offer a powerful tool in differential diagnosis. Rheumatoid nodules occur in about 20 percent of patients with well-developed rheumatoid arthritis. The effects of inflammation may be clinically detectable, but laboratory tests--e.g., the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and quantitative C-reactive protein--provide the most reliable evidence of inflammation. Synovial fluid analysis may reveal inflammatory changes and other abnormalities permitting diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 80 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but is not specific for this diagnosis.\r"

We studied the concentration of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone in amniotic fluid in 59 uncomplicated and in 73 complicated pregnancies. The mean (+/- SE) value of corticotropin-releasing hormone in amniotic fluid in uncomplicated pregnancies was significantly higher in the third (24.1 +/- 3.3 pmol/L) than in the second (9.1 +/- 0.7 pmol/L) trimester, but no change was found during labor. In groups matched by gestational age, larger mean values of corticotropin-releasing hormone and cortisol were observed in the group in which the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio was greater than 2 or the phosphatidylglycerol test was positive than in the group with a lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio less than 2 or a negative phosphatidylglycerol test result. In samples taken at an interval of 1 to 3 weeks, concomitant increases in corticotropin-releasing hormone and cortisol levels were found with the appearance of phosphatidylglycerol. Concentrations of corticotropin-releasing hormone in amniotic fluid were elevated in patients with diabetes and in women with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. We conclude that the intrauterine release of corticotropin-releasing hormone increases during the last trimester. This may stimulate the fetal pituitary-adrenal axis and promote fetal maturation.\r"

  ".W": "This study presents the sequential morphologic regeneration of graft-vs.-host (GVH)-induced dysplastic thymuses in long-term survivors of GVH reactions. GVH reactions were induced in adult C57BL/6xAF1 (B6AF1) hybrids by injecting 20 x 10(6) A strain parental lymphoid cells (PLC). Starting on day 30 after GVH induction, five to ten animals were randomly selected from a pool of GVH-reactive mice and killed at various times. Each animal was tested for thymic histology and T cell functions. Thymuses taken on day 30 after GVH induction displayed severe dysplasia as characterized by lymphocytic depletion, complete effacement of cortico-medullary demarcation, and reduction and total loss of medullary epithelial cells or both. Starting by days 60-70 after GVH induction, at least four stages of thymic regeneration were identified. Day 60-70 thymuses displayed cortical regeneration and the reappearance of cortico-medullary demarcation. The medulla of these thymuses, although containing dark individual epithelial cells and numerous lymphocytes, was devoid of pale epithelial cells (stage 1). The medulla of thymuses on day 100 after GVH induction displayed a few sparcely distributed pale epithelial cells and numerous lymphocytes as well as dark epithelial cells (stage 2). The medulla of thymuses examined 130 days after GVH induction displayed numerous pale individual epithelial cells and a few pale epithelial cell clusters. Such thymuses also showed a reduction in the number of medullary lymphocytes (stage 3). Finally, the medulla of thymuses 150-160 days after GVH induction displayed numerous pale epithelial cell clusters and Hassall's bodies. These thymuses were indistinguishable from normal adult thymuses (stage 4). All of the animals tested up to day 130 after GVH induction showed no significant T cell function. Animals displaying stage 4 of thymic regeneration showed significant proliferative responses to T cell mitogen, concanavalin A (conA), and six of ten animals also displayed a few plaque forming cells (PFC) to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in their spleens. Furthermore, all animals (10 of 10) killed on day 180 after GVH induction displayed significant T cell functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many of the pathophysiologic effects of bacterial endotoxin have recently been attributed to a monokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The rabbit eye is extremely sensitive to locally injected endotoxin. The authors have investigated the possible contribution of TNF to ocular inflammation in a rabbit model. The intravitreal injection of 10(5) to 5 X 10(5) units of recombinant human TNF produced a sustained disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier as manifested by elevated aqueous humor protein levels. In addition, 83% of rabbits receiving this dose of TNF developed hyperemia of limbal vessels and early neovascularization of the cornea. Many developed posterior synechiae (fibrous adhesions between the iris and the lens). TNF induced only a slight cellular response in the anterior chamber. Histologic studies confirmed the presence of new vessels and demonstrated a marked mononuclear infiltrate within and beneath the epithelium of the iris and ciliary body. Lower doses of TNF produced inconsistent results. Heating TNF completely destroyed its inflammatory effects. The time course of the ocular response to TNF and the quantity of recombinant protein needed to produce consistent effects were vastly different from effects observed with interleukin-1. For example, 24 hours after an intravitreal injection, 2.2 X 10(4) ng of TNF (5 X 10(5) units) produced significantly less protein extravasation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration than 4 ng of recombinant interleukin-1. Similarly, 24 hours after intravitreal injection, 1 ng of Escherichia coli endotoxin tended to be a more potent inflammatory stimulus than this quantity of TNF. These observations indicate that the ocular pathophysiologic effects of TNF can be readily distinguished from changes induced by either endotoxin or another endotoxin induced monokine, interleukin-1.\r"

In Mexican American children 6 months-11 years, 98.2 per cent had one or more DTP immunizations reported (95 per cent CI: 97.5, 98.9%); 85.1 per cent had three or more DTP immunizations reported (95 per cent CI: 83.2, 87.0%). The reported immunization coverage in Mexican American children was corroborated by the tetanus antitoxin titers which were above the minimum protective level (greater than or equal to 0.01 IU/ml) in 99.6 per cent of the 4-11 year olds. Using the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) recommendations for the number of DTP immunizations, 61.1 per cent of the children 6 months-11 years of age had the age-appropriate number of immunizations (95 per cent CI: 58.5, 63.7%).

Current methods of resolving seroma, such as vacuum drainage, are not risk free. A novel approach to this problem was the use of intraoperative topical fibrin glue. A model producing seromas was developed by modified radical neck dissection on Sprague-Dawley rats. Forty rats underwent this procedure. Twenty rats were treated with saline solution (control group) and 20 were treated with fibrin glue. At necropsy on day 5, a significant reduction in the frequency of seroma was noted in the fibrin glue group. Seventeen of 20 control rats had seroma whereas only 2 of 20 experimental animals had serous collection. The Fisher exact statistical correlation revealed p less than 0.000002; therefore, the use of fibrin glue in this role merits further evaluation.\r"

Visual analogue scores of postoperative wellbeing showed an improvement in both propofol groups (p less than 0.01); after thiopentone and enflurane the scores were reduced and took 2 days to return to the pre-operative values. There was a significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in postoperative morbidity in both the groups that received propofol up to 24 hours after discharge.

The complement levels (C3, C4, CH50) in different arterial diseases were measured, and the relationship of complement levels to serum lipids in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) was also investigated, in order to clarify a relationship between the complement system and arteriosclerosis or other arterial diseases. Bovine graft, dacron, and PTFE activated the complement system in vitro. In order of the degree of complement activation, bovine graft ranked first, followed by dacron and PTFE. The patient group with acute arterial occlusion showed high C3 and C4 levels. The healthy elderly group showed higher C3 and C4 levels than the healthy persons in their twenties. In ASO patients, C3 levels correlated with serum lipid levels. Judged from the relation of complement activation by vascular prostheses to the progression of arteriosclerotic changes, vascular prostheses should be assessed with regard to complement activation.\r"

  ".W": "As part of an epidemiologic cross-sectional study to determine cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in the population (total serum cholesterol, smoking, blood pressure, and body weight) hemoglobin (Hb) and plasma viscosity (PV) were measured. A two-stage cluster sample of 5,312 persons, aged twenty-five to sixty-four (available 5,069) was selected from a mixed urban-rural target population of 282,279 inhabitants, from which 4,022 (79.3%) participated in the study. Patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral infarction (CI), angina pectoris (AP), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were identified by questionnaire. The results show that there is no age or sex dependency of PV in healthy participants, while hemoglobin shows the well-known sex difference. In contrast, PV increases continuously with age in the total population. In men, increased PV is found in untreated hypertension, in hypercholesterolemia, and in smokers. In women, it is raised in hypercholesterolemia and in gross obesity. Male MI patients and patients of both sexes after CI in particular show statistically significantly elevated PV. Finally, in male patients with chronic AP or patients of both sexes with PAD, PV is elevated and a tendency to higher Hb values is seen. These results confirm smaller clinical trials suggesting that blood fluidity is pathologically altered in patients with CV risk factors or diseases. Since impaired blood fluidity may worsen the hemodynamic situation, in particular in patients with limited vasomotor reserve, hemorheologic parameters may be of prognostic relevance. Therapeutic implications of these findings should be considered.\r"

After appropriate survival times, the animals were killed and portions of the facial and trigeminal nerves as well as the brain stem were examined with virus isolation and immunocytochemistry for the presence of HSV. Both virus strains were demonstrated in the geniculate and trigeminal ganglia and in the CNS portion of the facial and trigeminal nerves, as well as in various brain stem areas including the trigeminal tract and nucleus, the facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and nuclei in the reticular formation. The results indicate that HSV is transported to the CNS by efferent and afferent axons of the tongue and subsequently via transneuronal passage to various brain stem nuclei. These findings provide an anatomic basis for a putative relationship between HSV and cranial nerve dysfunction.\r"

Although experimental data suggest that the newborn brain may be more resistant to ischemic injury than the adult brain, the minimum CBF necessary to sustain neuronal viability in newborn infants is unknown. We have measured CBF with positron emission tomography in 16 preterm and 14 term newborn infants and have determined the relationship between CBF and subsequent brain function as assessed by neurological examination and developmental assessment. The range of mean CBF in the preterm infants was 4.9 to 23 ml/(100 gm.min) and the range of mean CBF in the term infants was 9.0 to 73 ml/(100 gm.min). Five preterm infants and one term infant with mean CBF less than 10 ml/(100 gm.min) survived. Three of these 5 preterm infants, with mean CBF of 4.9, 5.2, and 9.3 ml/(100 gm.min), respectively, have normal neurological examinations and Bayley Scales of 80 or greater at 6, 6, and 24 months of age, respectively. One (mean CBF 6.9) has normal cognitive development (Bayley 103) and a mild spastic diplegia at age 19 months, and one infant (mean CBF 6.2) has a left hemiparesis and a Binet IQ score of 70 at age 33 months.

However, the mechanism by which this disease occurs after infection with HTLV-I is still obscure. We found that HAM patients have unusually high proportions of CD4+ HLA-DR+ cells, CD8+HLA-DR+ cells, OKT9+ cells, and CD38(OKT10)+ cells in their peripheral blood, all of which suggest the presence of activated T-lymphocytes. Antibody titer against HTLV-I was much higher in HAM patients than in HTLV-I carriers without evident neurological disease (p less than 0.01). Polyclonal gammopathy was also observed in most HAM patients, and 6 of 10 patients were positive for rheumatoid factor. These observations, coupled with the previous observation that corticosteroid therapy improves clinical symptoms in some patients, make it likely that continuous activation of the immune system, initiated by HTLV-I infection, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of HAM.\r"

All of these showed a significant increase after cigarette smoking. These data may suggest that the activation of complement induces the release of leukotrienes, and that these leukotrienes cause bronchoconstriction. It appears likely, therefore, that cigarette smoking induces an increase in peripheral venous blood leukotrienes and complement C3a and C5a, and that such an increase may elicit bronchoconstriction.\r"

In patients with an IAP greater than 25 cm H2O, a paracentesis was performed to decrease the IAP by 10 cm H2O. After paracentesis, a decrease in the IAP from 33.47 to 19.06 cm H2O (p less than 0.001) resulted in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) (p less than 0.001), stroke index (p less than 0.001), left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) (p less than 0.01), and right ventricular stroke work (p less than 0.01). The therapeutic effects of paracentesis on renal function were: a decrease in BUN and serum creatinine (p less than 0.001) and an increase in the creatinine clearance (Ccr) (p less than 0.001), urine volume (p less than 0.001), osmolar clearance (Cosm) (p less than 0.001), and urine creatinine (p less than 0.001) values. The IAP correlated directly with the TPR (r = +0.35, p less than 0.01) and inversely with the CI (r = -0.39, p less than 0.001) and LVSW (r = -0.37, p less than 0.001) in the 126 studies of IAP performed with the 25 patients. IAP also correlated directly with BUN (r = 0.40, p less than 0.001), serum creatinine (r = 0.28, p less than 0.01), and free water clearance (CH2O) (r = 0.3, p less than 0.001); IAP correlated negatively with Ccr (r = -0.54, p less than 0.001) and Cosm (r = -0.43, p less than 0.001). In critically ill cirrhotic patients, IAP, when measured noninvasively via a bladder catheter, is an accurate and useful method to follow manipulation of ascitic fluid pressure quantitatively in order to optimize hemodynamic and renal function.\r"

  ".W": "\"Redo\" operations for coronary artery disease have become commonplace. One of the major complications that occurs is perioperative infarction due to embolization of atheromatous material from diseased veins into the distal coronary arteries. Because of this, we began using retrograde coronary sinus perfusion (RCSP) for delivery of cardioplegia to prevent the embolization of grumous material. It is our belief that retrograde flow through the coronary arteries is an effective preventive measure. In addition, RCSP is a simple method of delivery in redo operations such as aortic valve replacement where the majority of coronary flow is through patent vein grafts. Sixty-five of approximately 3,100 patients in our practice in the past three years underwent a cardiac operation in which RCSP was used for cardioplegia delivery. Ventricular function in all patients was well preserved, and all survived. There were no complications associated with the use of this method.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a technique for selectively cooling the right heart during cardioplegic arrest by intracavitary right atrial (RA) perfusion with cold blood. In dogs during hypothermic cardioplegic arrest, we compared the effects on myocardial temperature of RA perfusion and two snared caval cannulas with three methods of venous cannulation without perfusion: a two-stage atriocaval cannula, two caval cannulas and two snared caval cannulas. The mean atrioventricular (AV) node temperature with RA perfusion (16.5 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C) was significantly lower than with the atriocaval cannula (25.1 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C), two caval cannulas (25.2 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C) or two snared caval cannulas (21.6 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C) (p less than 0.01, RA perfusion versus other groups). The results for RA wall temperature showed a similar pattern. RA perfusion produced similar results in 6 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. We conclude that hypothermic protection of the right atrium and AV node is inadequate with conventional techniques of cannulation and cooling, and may be improved by the use of internal RA cooling.\r"

The immediate postoperative decrease in left atrial pressure (from 16.7 +/- 1.0 to 9.4 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) was inversely correlated with postoperative urine output (r = -0.69; p less than 0.001) and sodium excretion (r = -0.51; p less than 0.005). There was no significant relationship between postoperative urine output or sodium excretion and other hemodynamic or nonhemodynamic variables. A significant postoperative decrease in plasma atrial natriuretic factor (from 150 +/- 22 to 65 +/- 14 pg/ml; p less than 0.01) and increase in plasma renin activity (from 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 8.7 +/- 3.2; p less than 0.05) occurred in patients with a 7 mm Hg or greater postoperative decrease in left atrial pressure. Thus, an acute reduction in left atrial pressure results in significant reductions in urine output and sodium excretion, the magnitude of which are related to the degree of reduction in left atrial pressure.\r"

Even during the period of controlled low pressure, flow began to decline, and the decline continued during the period in which the pressure was controlled at 75 mm Hg. Calculated coronary vascular resistance rose steadily from an initially low value to one well above the normal value for beating hearts. A transient fall in resistance resulted from the administration of a bolus of nitroglycerin into the aortic root. When the initial reperfusate was normokalemic, coronary flow was less and coronary vascular resistance higher during the initial phase of reperfusion. The systemic arterial pressure and resistance fell during the first 1 minute to 3 minutes of reperfusion and in 25% of patients, remained low. The greater the potassium load delivered during the initially hyperkalemic phase, the longer the interval between the beginning of reperfusion and the resumption of cardiac systole.\r"

Nine patients are in remission, and the condition of one patient improved. Relapses occurred in four patients after intervals of remission ranging from four to 30 months, but responded to increased doses of trimethoprim in two patients, while two patients required resumption of therapy with cytotoxic agents. Although the effects of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are suppressive rather than curative, its use represents a major advance in treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis, permitting successful treatment of many patients without high toxic doses of cyclophosphamide and prednisone.\r"

Homeless alcoholics were also more likely to have entered treatment programs and to have engaged in problem behaviors as children and adults. Emphasis was placed on the complicated etiologic relationship between alcoholism and homelessness, and on the need for alcohol rehabilitation services that are sensitive to the unique situations in which homeless alcoholics find themselves.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles has been shown to affect their spasticity, especially in patients with hemiplegia. But little has been reported on the long-term effects of such stimulation on individuals with spinal cord injury. This paper documents initial quadriceps spasticity in 31 spinal cord injured subjects, and the effect of four to eight weeks of reconditioning using electrical stimulation. Spasticity was quantified through the use of a normalized relaxation index (R2n) obtained from a pendulum drop test. The reconditioning protocol consisted of twice daily 20-minute exercise sessions at least four hours apart, six days per week. Spasticity and stimulated quadriceps torque were measured during one to three evaluations performed at least one day apart at the beginning of the program, and at four and eight weeks. There was no significant difference in average initial measures of spasticity between left and right legs and no effect of time since injury on average R2n values. Significant differences were seen for right leg average baseline R2n values when grouped by lesion level or completeness. Quadriplegic individuals were more spastic than paraplegic individuals, and subjects with incomplete lesions were more spastic than those with complete lesions. These findings are interrelated since most of the quadriplegic subjects (14 of 16) had incomplete lesions. Most participants had increased spasticity after four weeks of reconditioning but not after eight weeks. However, only eight subjects completed eight weeks of reconditioning. Subjects who had the greatest increases in spasticity also had the greatest gains in stimulated torque, both after four and eight weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Attempts to use CTLs in human cancer therapy have focused on the cell-surface molecules that regulate CTL function. An important molecule in CTL function is the CD3 antigen. Biochemical characterization has suggested that the CD3 antigen may function as a \"trigger\" for T-lymphocyte activation. To investigate this possibility, we used monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the CD3 antigen to trigger activation of long-term CTL lines. The anti-CD3 MAb was able to trigger killing of a variety of human and mouse tumor cell lines; however, not all tumor cells were lysed by the CTL. The susceptibility of the tumor cells to CTL-mediated lysis appeared to correlate with the binding of the anti-CD3 MAb to the tumor cell surface. The requirement for surface binding of the MAb was tested by covalently cross-linking the anti-CD3 MAb to the tumor cell membrane. Membrane-bound anti-CD3 MAb triggered high levels of CTL-mediated tumor cell killing. Similar results were obtained when anti-CD3 MAb was cross-linked to phosphatidylethanolamine and inserted into the cell membrane. These results indicate that the attachment of anti-CD3 MAb to the tumor cell surface provides a powerful new approach to the in vitro activation of human killer T cells and the in vivo treatment of human cancer.\r"

Macrophages have IL-2 receptors but their function is unknown. We investigated the effect of IL-2 on Kupffer cells, the fixed macrophages of the liver, using an in vitro rat hepatocyte-Kupffer cell coculture system. In this model, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) triggers Kupffer cells to induce suppression of hepatocyte protein synthesis. We found that pretreatment with 10 U/mL or more of IL-2 primed Kupffer cells, significantly reducing the concentration of lipopolysaccharide necessary to trigger Kupffer cell-mediated suppression of hepatocyte protein synthesis. Higher concentrations of IL-2 (greater than or equal to 1 x 10(4) U/mL) alone were capable of priming and triggering Kupffer cells to suppress hepatocyte protein synthesis. These data show that IL-2 increases Kupffer cell sensitivity to endotoxin, suggesting that IL-2 may play an important role in regulating macrophage responses to septic stimuli.\r"

The results indicate that prostaglandin E may play a primary role in allogeneic blood transfusion-induced suppression, as manifest by normal responses in ibuprofen-treated mice.

  ".W": "We hypothesize that alterations of hepatocyte function in sepsis are modulated by endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide)-triggered Kupffer cells. In the present experiments the effect of lipopolysaccharide on secreted and cellular proteins synthesized by hepatocytes cultured alone or cocultured with Kupffer cells was investigated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lipopolysaccharide had no direct effect on the types or amounts of secreted proteins synthesized by hepatocytes alone. Kupffer cells coculturing resulted in increased synthesis of some hepatocyte proteins (68k and 23k) whose production was not altered by lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, addition of lipopolysaccharide to the hepatocyte-Kupffer cell coculture substantially decreased synthesis of several proteins (73k, 66k, and 35k). Despite an overall decrease in protein synthesis of hepatocytes cocultured with Kupffer cells after the addition of lipopolysaccharide, there was increased synthesis of several individual proteins (58k and 44k). Similar effects were seen in synthesis of cellular protein. The addition of recombinant interleukin 1 to hepatocytes alone or in coculture had no effect on the amount or type of protein synthesized. We conclude that Kupffer cells regulate the types and amounts of individual proteins synthesized by hepatocytes via mediators other than interleukin 1.\r"

  ".W": "The immunosuppression seen following major trauma and burns has long been attributed in part to prostaglandin E (PGE). This has been due primarily to the demonstration that PGE levels are elevated following burns and that when PGE is added to leukocyte cultures, it impairs multiple types of leukocyte functions. We investigated the effect of a new long-acting PGE derivative, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE, on immune function in multiple animal models. The PGE derivative had no effect on mortality in burn sepsis models but improved mean survival times in an Escherichia coli peritonitis model. The PGE derivative impaired neutrophil migration into burn wounds at lower dosages. In a rat burn model, when PGE was administered parenterally, it failed to impair cell-mediated immunity at any dosage and improved lymphocyte function at certain dosages. These data indicate that PGE may not be as immunosuppressive in in vivo models as it has been shown to be in in vitro models.\r"

Twin studies may provide valuable information on this question. However, most published twin series are selected and no through clinical twin studies based on epidemiologic series have been carried out. In this study, all available same-sex twin pairs with clinically definite multiple sclerosis derived from the Finnish Twin Cohort of 15815 pairs were studied by clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging, and visual and auditory evoked responses. The mean length of follow-up of the pairs after the onset of symptoms of multiple sclerosis was 20 years. Two of the seven monozygotic pairs were concordant; one was definitely so, and in the other, the co-twin of the index case had, in addition to clinical findings, white matter changes suggestive of multiple sclerosis in magnetic resonance imaging and abnormal visual evoked responses. All six dizygotic pairs were discordant. The frequency of the HLA antigen DR2 in probands (69%) was significantly increased, but the distribution among the healthy subjects and patients showed nonsignificant differences. The results indicate a genetic influence on the susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, although still unknown genetic determinants are possible involved.\r"

An exception was one patient whose metastatic small cell lung cancer to the brain showed focally increased uptake. These findings suggest that certain brain tumors such as melanoma are capable of selectively binding iofetamine I 123 because of specific chemical properties of the radiopharmaceutical. Increased uptake of iofetamine I 123 in brain lesions in a patient at risk for metastatic melanoma may be a useful aid to differential diagnosis.\r"

Proliferative synovium was enzymatically digested to obtain tissue-derived lymphocytes. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of patient PBL and STL with a variety of monoclonal antibodies failed to reveal a consistent alteration in the number of CD4+ (helper/inducer) PBL or STL. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells in rheumatoid STL (P less than 0.05). A significant reduction in the density of the T cell differentiation antigens CD3 and CD4 was observed in RA PBL and STL, compared with control PBL. These differences in antigen density were not seen when normal PBL were subjected to the same enzymatic digestion. Both RA PBL and STL manifested increased expression of HLA-DR antigens, without augmentation of interleukin-2 receptor expression. Alterations in the expression of the T cell differentiation antigens and activation antigens by patient PBL closely paralleled the abnormalities observed in STL. In contrast, STL of patients with RA exhibited an increase in the expression of the adhesion-related glycoproteins (leukocyte function-associated 1 [LFA-1] and very late activation 1 [VLA-1] antigens), not observed with autologous PBL. These studies demonstrate that lymphocytes isolated from the synovial tissues of RA patients bear an activated phenotype, exemplified by the modulation of CD3 and CD4 and the expression of HLA-DR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this report, we studied another activity of CD4+ cells, namely the capacity to induce T-suppressor cell activity. The results clearly show a selective dysfunction of CD4+ suppressor-inducer (Tsi) cell function. Since these HIV-seropositive hemophilia patients showed the presence of activated B cells in the peripheral circulation refractory to antigen-specific T-helper cell signals and secreting specific antibodies spontaneously, we raised the hypothesis that the activated B cells in the patients activate the Tsi cells in vivo. This constant activation leads to a functional exhaustion of the Tsi cell pool.\r"

  ".W": "We and others have established a role for T lymphocytes and their products in the regulation of erythropoiesis. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a multipotential lymphokine with burst-promoting activity that is produced by activated T lymphocytes. In the anemic, stem cell-defective W/Wv mouse we have described the absence of a functionally active thymocyte population that in normal animals enhances erythroid progenitor growth and stem cell self-renewal. In studies reported here we find that W/Wv mouse marrow responds to exogenous IL-3 by increased erythroid progenitor cell growth. The BFU-E and CFU-E from anemic donors are more sensitive to IL-3 than are those in +/+ marrow. We have recently observed a stimulatory effect of bryostatin 1 (a macrocyclic lactone derived from a marine invertebrate) on normal erythropoiesis in human bone marrow progenitor assays. To test the effects of this molecule on murine normal and anemic W/Wv cells we grew these cells in the presence of increasing doses of bryostatin 1. Bryostatin mimics the stimulatory action of IL-3 on W/Wv bone marrow. Polyclonal antibody directed against murine IL-3 blocks the stimulatory effect of bryostatin on erythropoiesis. Otherwise inactive thymocytes from W/Wv mice in coculture with W/Wv bone marrow showed stimulation of erythropoiesis in the presence of bryostatin. We believe that bryostatin may in part act by stimulating T lymphocytes to release physiologic concentrations of lymphokines.\r"

These IL-2 receptors could be demonstrated to mediate a physiologic response to the lymphokine for which the high-affinity form of the IL-2 receptor appears to be essential. The phenotype of PER-117 cells corresponds to the earliest identifiable stage of T-cell differentiation, which is defined by the lack of the T3-T-cell receptor complex and the presence of the 40 Kd protein recognized by monoclonal antibodies of the CD7 group. Further evidence for the clonality and T-cell lineage of this cell line was obtained by analysis of rearrangements of genes for the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain and for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgJH) genes. PER-117 cells could be shown to have rearranged TCR beta genes but no rearrangement of the IgJH genes. Cell line PER-117 provides a model to investigate the requirements for induction of IL-2 receptors in a cell expressing the first T-cell-specific marker and may help to elucidate the role of IL-2 during thymic differentiation and in the uncontrolled proliferation of T-cell leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "The karyotypes of 57 cases of childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were analyzed to establish the cytogenetic profile in this disease. Three questions were of particular interest. Do the chromosomal changes in T-cell ALL preferentially affect bands where genes encoding the T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) have been mapped? Do alterations involving the TCR gene regions appear with any notable frequency in B-progenitor ALL? Do chromosomal abnormalities in this disease relate to stage of T-cell ontogeny? A relatively high proportion of cases (65%) had a pseudodiploid karyotype at presentation, the majority (58%) characterized by a translocation. The overall frequency of translocations was 44%, comparable to that among all banded cases of ALL seen in our laboratory. Hypodiploidy and hyperdiploidy were exceedingly rare (only four of 57 cases); 16 cases (28%) had apparently normal karyotypes. In half the cases with a translocation (14 of 24), the breakpoints were in regions to which the alpha and beta chain TCR genes have been mapped. Chromosomal breakpoints that were consistently observed in the vicinity of TCR gene loci were 7q32-q36 (TCR beta chain; n = 8), 14q11-q13 (TCR alpha chain; n = 6); other frequent breakpoints were 9p13-pter (n = 8) and 6q15-qter (n = 9). Chromosomal alterations occurred near TCR gene loci significantly more often in T-cell cases than in a comparison group of 335 patients with B-cell precursor ALL (26% v 1.5%, P = .0001). Stage I thymocyte development (CD7+, CD2+, CD5+, CD1-, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-) was noted in 23 cases, stage II (CD7+, CD2+, CD5+, CD1+, CD3-, CD4 +/-, CD8 +/-) in 25 cases, and stage III (CD9+, CD2+, CD1-, CD5+, CD3+, and either CD4+ or CD8+) in nine cases. The only statistically significant associations between cytogenetic findings and T-cell ontogeny were a higher frequency of normal karyotypes in cases with stage I thymocytes, and of pseudodiploidy in stage II cases. There was no apparent relationship between particular translocations and level of thymocyte maturation. Our findings indicate that most children with T-cell ALL have pseudodiploid karyotypes, although a surprisingly high percentage lack demonstrable abnormal clones. Specific chromosomal changes do not appear to be related to discrete stages of T-cell ontogeny as defined in this study, but they occur preferentially in bands containing TCR genes.\r"

Cells from enriched fractions (70% to 90% CD34+) were found to proliferate strongly in response to hIL-3. Phenotypic analysis and morphologic characterization of the proliferating cells demonstrated a rapid decrease in CD34+ cells and an exponential increase in the number of cells belonging to the neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocyte/macrophage, and thrombocytic lineages. When combined with recombinant human erythropoietin, burst colonies and cells expressing glycophorin-A were detected, thereby demonstrating the effects of hIL-3 on erythroid progenitors. Further, the development of mixed-erythroid colonies indicated that multipotential cells within CD34-enriched fractions responded to hIL-3. In addition, we examined the effect of hIL-3 on the proliferation of primary acute myeloblastic leukemia cells in liquid culture. We found that hIL-3 was able to induce cell proliferation in a proportion of the cases tested. Heterogeneity of the responses to hIL-3 was in part related to French-American-British classification but could not be correlated with CD34 antigen expression by the leukemic cells. These results indicate that, although the effects of hIL-3 on proliferation and differentiation of cells obtained from normal hematopoietic specimens were primarily borne by CD34+ cells, expression of the CD34 molecule per se is an insufficient condition to determine a growth response to this lymphokine.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1), recently identified as hemopoietin-1, affects hematopoiesis by presumably direct and indirect mechanisms. IL-1 stimulates primitive hematopoietic stem cells to express receptors for the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs) and stimulates CSF release from accessory cells. We used highly purified murine granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM, up to 92% cloning efficiency) to assess the effects of IL-1 alpha on the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of these cells. The results demonstrated that IL-1 alpha does not directly influence the proliferation or differentiation of purified CFU-GM in the presence of plateau concentrations of purified natural or recombinant CSFs, and IL-1 alpha lacks intrinsic CSF activity of its own. CSF deprivation studies showed that IL-1 alpha rapidly (within one hour) promoted CFU-GM survival in the absence of CSF. This enhanced survival stimulated by IL-1 alpha was observed with CFU-GM responding to purified recombinant GM-CSF, natural M-CSF, recombinant G-CSF, recombinant IL-3, or IL-3 in WEHI-conditioned medium, and no effect on the pattern of CFU-GM differentiation occurred in cultures incubated with IL-1 alpha in the absence of CSF. The IL-1 alpha effects on CFU-GM are probably due to a direct action on progenitor cells because the presence or absence of accessory cells did not alter the results and concentrations of the CSFs that were too low to stimulate the proliferation of CFU-GM could not mimic the IL-1 alpha effect on CFU-GM survival.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions (AILs) including angiocentric lymphoma were evaluated clinically and pathologically. Pathologic subclassification performed without knowledge of the clinical outcome divided the cases into three histologic grades on the basis of cellular atypia and degree of inflammatory background. Immunophenotypic studies of lesions from six patients demonstrated a mature T-cell phenotype with a predominance of CD4-positive cells. Abnormalities of antigenic phenotype were demonstrated in only one case, classified as grade III. That tumor also demonstrated a clonal rearrangement of the T beta gene. Progression to malignant lymphoma following initial immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone occurred in three of nine patients with grade I lesions and four of six patients with grade II lesions. The supervening lymphomas were usually refractory to subsequent aggressive chemotherapy, with only one patient achieving a complete remission. In contrast, seven of eight patients with grade III lesions achieved a complete remission with aggressive combination chemotherapy, two of whom also received supplemental radiation therapy. These studies support the concept that the AILs represent a spectrum of post-thymic T-cell proliferations. The single most important prognostic indicator for ultimate survival is achievement of an initial complete remission. Patients treated initially with conservative chemotherapy may be compromised in their ability to achieve a complete remission if they progress to a higher grade lesion.\r"

On the other hand, higher levels of secreted IL-2 were found in SFL cultures compared to corresponding PBL cultures of RA patients and normal donors. Specificity of the IL-2 bioassay was confirmed by blocking the T-cell blast proliferation (induced by SFL culture supernatants), by 83 +/- 4%, after addition of a monoclonal anti-IL-2R antibody. Despite the high levels of soluble IL-2, only a weak proliferative response was observed in the corresponding SFL cultures.\r"

Patients with major CNS disease showed an uncoupling of glucose and oxygen metabolism when compared with patients without cerebral disease and normal subjects. The mean ratio between oxygen and glucose utilization was 3.8 moles of oxygen per mole of glucose in patients with CNS disease, compared with 5.6 for controls and 6.4 for patients with myopathy alone. The altered stoichiometry in CNS cases indicates aerobic glycolysis to lactate and/or other intermediate metabolites. Patients with major CNS disease showed a 50% reduction in cerebral oxygen utilization compared with cerebrally unaffected patients and normal subjects. These findings indicate that in patients with a mitochondrial encephalopathy the defect identified in skeletal muscle is also expressed in the brain.\r"

The incontinence was moderate to severe in 41% of the patients, and 95% of the family caregivers living with these patients viewed the incontinence as a problem.

Future research should emphasize the assessment of remedial interventions.\r"

These antibodies were all satisfactory in the staining of normal peripheral lymphoid tissues and cortical thymic lymphocytes were reactive with BF1 and BF2 but not with WT31. Hassall's corpuscles in two of three thymuses studied reacted with all three antibodies. BF1 was superior to the other two antibodies, especially for lymphoid cells in cytospin preparations. Fifty-five lymphomas, 24 nonlymphoid malignancies, seven established cell lines, and five cases of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) proliferation with neutropenia were studied. The majority of non-T-cell lesions did not react with the antibodies. An occasional case showed weak reactivity which could be easily distinguished from the usual strong reaction with T-cells. Tumor cells from over 90% of snap frozen peripheral T-cell lymphomas reacted with BF1 and BF2. BF1 was the preferred antibody since it gave a stronger and more consistent reaction. It was also the antibody of choice in identifying T-lymphoblastic lymphomas. Michel's solution fixed tissue showed markedly diminished or absent reactivity with BF2 and WT31, but BF1 reactivity was less affected. Some unusual T-cell phenotypes, with respect to the pattern of expression of BF1 antigen and CD3, were observed. BF1 and anti-CD3, in combination, would be useful in identifying T-cell lesions with aberrant or unusual TCR-CD3 phenotypes.\r"

The SSVG was anastomosed to the major diagonal branch by side-to-side anastomosis and to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) by end-to-side anastomosis in 13 patients who had 75-100% and 75-90% stenoses in the LAD and major diagonal branch, respectively. IMAG anastomoses were performed to the LAD in 10 patients with 75-100% stenoses of the artery. The blood-flow velocities were measured by the 20-MHz, eighty-channel ultrasound pulsed Doppler method during surgery. In six patients in the SSVG group, we investigated the configuration of velocity profiles at the region just proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis and at the bridge portion between the side-to-side and end-to-side anastomosis. In the other seven patients, we measured the blood-flow velocity at several centimeters proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis and compared it with that in the IMAG. At the region just proximal to the side-to-side anastomosis, the velocity profile skewed toward the anastomosis side wall in all patients, and the flow velocity near the wall opposite to the side-to-side anastomosis was reversed in five of six patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This IL-2 regimen induces a reversible renal hypoperfusion syndrome (pre-renal azotemia) without evidence of acute uric acid nephropathy. Hypophosphatemia [median serum phosphorus of 1.9 mg/dl (0.61 mmol/l)] prompted further study of tubular function. Urinary excretions of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium were very low. Arterial blood gases revealed hyperventilation without alkalemia. The hypophosphatemia probably reflects increased utilization of inorganic phosphorus by rapidly proliferating lymphoid cells.\r"

Recent studies have shown that the release of anaphylatoxins may be inhibited by high-dose corticosteroids (HDC). In a double-blind study 30 consecutive patients with osteoarthritis or failed hip fractures were randomized into two groups; 15 patients received HDC at the beginning of the operation and 15 patients, designated the control group, received infused saline. Anaphylatoxin formation, arterial oxygen tension, and blood pressure were determined preoperatively, during the operation, and one day postoperatively. The patients who received HDC had no significant alteration regarding the anaphylatoxins or arterial oxygen tension during surgery. However, in the control group elevated C3a levels and decreased PaO2 levels were found. Corticosteroids therefore inhibit complement activation and anaphylatoxin release in hip arthroplasty surgery.\r"

Maternal use of cocaine during pregnancy has been associated with complications in the fetus and newborn infant, including spontaneous abortions, preterm labor, cerebral infarctions, seizures, renal anomalies, and neurobehavioral and neurophysiologic abnormalities. This paper presents a case of necrotizing enterocolitis at birth in a term newborn exposed to cocaine antenatally. Cultures of the bowel grew two types of Clostridia organisms, Escherichia coli and group B streptococcus. It is suggested that bowel ischemia was secondary to the vasoconstrictive properties of the maternally abused cocaine and that secondary invasion of the bowel by multiple bacteria ensued. This case presents another possible complication to the newborn of maternal cocaine exposure in utero, namely ischemic infarction of the bowel.\r"

The cytolytic effect was observed to be highest with pPDA, followed by paraaminophenol, orthophenylenediamine, and metaphenylenediamine. Resorcinol and the control produced no cytolytic reaction. These results showed a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo tests.

We measured LD (U/L), blood total lymphocyte count (1,000/cu mm), and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference P(A-a)O2 (mm Hg), in 30 patients with AIDS and PCP (group 1), four patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and non-Pneumocystis pneumonia (NPCP) (group 2), and seven patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia (PPB) (group 3). In patients with AIDS and PCP, LD was 509 +/- 35 (mean +/- SE), which was significantly elevated in comparison to both AIDS/ARC patients with NPCP (228 +/- 21) (p less than .001), and patients with PPB (211 +/- 21) (p less than .001). There was a significant positive correlation between LD and P(A-a)O2 (r = .51, p = 0.01). P(A-a)O2 was markedly elevated in both AIDS patients with PCP (48 +/- 3), and patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (44 +/- 3), but only moderately elevated in AIDS/ARC patients with NPCP (29 +/- 6). These results suggest that measurement of LD may be useful in differentiating Pneumocystis pneumonia from non-Pneumocystis pneumonia. In addition, the increase in LD correlates with the degree of pulmonary oxygen transfer abnormality.\r"

Thirty-one (31 percent) individuals exhibited significant improvement in airflow rates after bronchodilator inhalation, while 33 (33 percent) had low flow rates. Twenty (20 percent) individuals had both low flow rates and a significant response to bronchodilator. In 83 percent of symptomatic individuals treated with bronchodilators there was clinical improvement. Thus, we conclude that abnormally low forced expiratory flow rate with or without bronchial hyperreactivity is a common and treatable complication of AIDS.\r"

Subsets were assessed by monoclonal antibodies and a pure preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by centrifugation of heparinized whole blood with a Ficoll/Triosil gradient. In 12 pairs studied within 5 yr of diagnosis, we observed a reduction in the percentage of cells reacting with OKT8 (recognizing the CD8 antigen present on the suppressor/cytotoxic subset) (P less than .05), but a similar level was detected in their nondiabetic cotwins. In 12 pairs studied greater than 5 yr after the diagnosis and in whom the nondiabetic twin is less likely to develop diabetes, the percentage of cells reacting with OKT8 was reduced in both the diabetic (P less than .05) and the nondiabetic (P less than .01) twins. Reductions were also seen with OKT3 (recognizing the CD3 antigen present on the total T-lymphocyte population) and OKT4 (recognizing the CD4 antigen present on the helper/inducer subset), but only in the diabetic twins from the group with longer discordance. We conclude that a reduced percentage of suppressor/cytotoxic cells is associated with type I diabetes, but the reduction appears to be genetically determined. Total T-lymphocytes are also reduced but mainly in the helper/inducer subset and only in diabetic patients of long duration. Such a reduction cannot therefore be primarily genetically determined.\r"

This study examined the effects of CRF and stress on gastric secretory and gastrointestinal motor functions in rats. Partial body restraint as a stress-producing stimulus significantly decreased gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying, and small bowel transit but markedly increased large bowel transit. Corticotropin-releasing factor given cerebroventricularly mimicked the gastrointestinal secretory and motor responses induced by partial body restraint. Cerebroventricular administration of a specific CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF-(9-41), but not of the CRF fragment CRF-(1-20), prevented the gastrointestinal secretory and motor responses elicited either by partial body restraint or by exogenous administration of CRF in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that the gastrointestinal secretory and motor responses in rats produced by stress (partial body restraint) are mediated by the endogenous release of CRF. They also indicate that CRF exerts its central nervous system actions on the gastrointestinal tract by a receptor-mediated event.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate (a) the diagnosis and treatment of 80 consecutive patients with severe, ongoing hematochezia from unknown source and (b) the effectiveness and safety of urgent colonoscopy after oral purge. Fifty-two men and 28 women (mean age, 64.5 yr) received a mean of 6.5 U of blood and had negative anoscopy, rigid sigmoidoscopy, and nasogastric tube aspiration before our evaluation. Because of ongoing severe hematochezia in the intensive care unit, urgent diagnosis and treatment was recommended by the attending physicians and surgeons. Emergency panendoscopy was performed before purge. Urgent colonoscopy was performed in the intensive care unit after patients received oral purge and their gut was cleared of blood, clots, and stool. The final diagnosis in these patients was 74% colonic lesions (30% angiomata, 17% diverticulosis, 11% polyps or cancer, 9% focal ulcers, 7% other), 11% upper gastrointestinal lesions, and 9% presumed small bowel lesions. No lesion site was identified in 6%. Clinically significant fluid retention (medically controlled) occurred in 4% of patients after purge. Sixty-four percent of patients had intervention for control of bleeding: 39% had therapeutic endoscopy, 24% surgery, and 1% therapeutic angiography. For 22 patients who also had emergency visceral angiography, the diagnostic yield was 14% and the complication rate was 9%. Our conclusions for patients with severe ongoing hematochezia from an unknown site were as follows. (a) Oral purge was effective and safe for cleansing the colon of stool, clots, and blood. Sulfate purge appeared to be safer than saline purge. (b) Before urgent colonoscopy and purge, emergency panendoscopy was indicated to exclude an upper gastrointestinal bleeding source. (c) Urgent colonoscopy after purge was effective, safe, and often diagnostic. (d) Compared with urgent colonoscopy, urgent visceral angiography was often nondiagnostic. However, the examinations may be complementary. (e) Hemostasis via colonoscopy has a definitive role in the treatment of some focal colonic lesions such as bleeding angiomata.\r"

After cold storage in each of the test solutions, the livers underwent 90 min of warm, oxygenated, sanguinous perfusion. A significant increase in liver weight was noted in Eurocollins-stored versus UW-lactobionate-stored livers. After 90 min of perfusion, livers preserved in UW-lactobionate produced significantly more bile and liberated significantly less glucose and transaminases when compared with Eurocollins-stored livers. Significant augmentation of bile production was observed when donor animals were pretreated with SRI 63-441 and the livers were then stored in UW-lactobionate for 24 h. Eurocollins-stored livers demonstrated increased hepatocyte vacuolization and endothelial disruption when compared with UW-lactobionate-stored livers after 12 and 24 h of preservation. This study demonstrates the superiority of UW-lactobionate solution in liver preservation and suggests that SRI 63-441 may be beneficial in the further reduction of cold ischemic injury.\r"

The incidence of variceal recurrences and recurrent bleeding over a median follow-up of 17 months after stopping sclerotherapy did not differ significantly in the three groups. Analysis of the time course of variceal recurrences showed that the recurrence-free interval was almost identical in group 1 and group 2 patients (13 and 14 months, respectively). Group 3 patients had a shorter recurrence-free interval (8.3 months), but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that sclerotherapy can be stopped safely when either complete eradication or reduction of varices to small white columns is obtained.\r"

After intravariceal injection of absolute alcohol (8 ml in 12 patients and 12 ml in 2 patients), mean +/- SD pulmonary artery pressure was seen to increase significantly (p less than 0.01) at 1 and 5 min and return to basal level by 15 min. Similar changes in pulmonary arterial pressure were seen after intravariceal injection of saline; the difference in the rise in pulmonary arterial pressure between the two groups was not significant. The pulmonary capillary-wedged pressure and systemic blood pressure did not change significantly after intravariceal injection of alcohol. Absolute alcohol in the amount usually used for sclerotherapy has minimal and transient effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and, in this respect, it appears to be a relatively safe sclerosant.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of regional pulmonary blood flow (PBF) on lung water measurements made with a blood-borne label (15O-water) and positron emission tomography (PET) in five dogs. The total lung water (TLW) content of a lung region obtained at equilibrium after intravenous injection of 15O-water (TLW-water) was compared with calculations made from lung density measurements (TLW-density) also obtained with PET. These latter measurements are proportional to the tissue attenuation of radioactivity originating from an external source encircling the animal and are independent of PBF. Comparisons were made before and 60 min after oleic acid-induced injury confined to the left caudal lobe (LCL). PBF fell 61% in regions from the dorsal half of the LCL after lung injury and was unchanged on the right side. Both before and after injury, TLW-density was 10-15% higher than TLW-water. This systematic difference is probably due to overestimates of TLW-density resulting from partial volume and scattered radiation effects. When TLW-water and TLW-density were compared in 151 3-ml regions from both normal and injured lung, the disparity between the two methods of calculating TLW increased in regions with a PBF less than 0.5 ml.min-1.ml lung-1 (less than 20% of base line). However, this represented only 22% of the injured regions analyzed. Thus lung water measurements made with PET and 15O-water are accurate until regional PBF is severely reduced. With PET, such areas can be eliminated from analysis or regions can be made sufficiently large so the overall effect on the TLW measurement is minimized.\r"

We were interested in studying the relationship between the circadian rhythm in body temperature and 24-h variations in plasma concentrations of iron, zinc, circulating leukocyte counts, and plasma interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity. Eight healthy men were studied for two separate 48-h sessions. Rectal temperature, plasma iron and zinc concentrations, plasma IL-1 activity, circulating leukocyte counts, and several other blood variables were monitored. Circadian rhythms in temperature, trace metals, and various leukocyte populations were demonstrated. The 24-h pattern of changes in plasma concentrations of iron and zinc approximate an inverse relationship with rectal temperature. Although we were unable to detect any IL-1 activity in human plasma collected at 4-h intervals, the daily changes in plasma trace metal concentrations and the variations in leukocyte populations may provide indirect evidence for a daily variation in local (e.g., in liver) or central nervous system release of IL-1.\r"

Myocardial protection by cold crystalloid cardioplegia improved results reducing the perioperative mortality for AVR alone from 21.7 to 11.1%. We believe that these patients should not be denied operative intervention since worthwhile improvement generally ensues. Coronary artery grafting can be hazardous. Bioprostheses inserted with myocardial protection favours surgery over continued medical management which offers little for these elderly symptomatic patients.\r"

In a double blind placebo-controlled study, we measured the effects of 2.5 and 10 mg prednisone, orally, on the circadian variation of serum OC in 15 normal subjects (8 women and 7 men), aged 22-46 yr. All subjects were studied twice at an interval of 1 week. Blood samples were collected every 60 min from 1630 until 1700 h the following day. Prednisone or placebo was given at 2000 h. Serum OC was measured by an in-house RIA. After placebo administration serum OC increased from 2230 h to a peak value around 0230 h, followed by a gradual decline to a nadir around 1500 h. Both doses of prednisone inhibited and even reversed the nocturnal rise in serum OC levels; the inhibition occurred within 3-4 h. There was no significant difference in the time from prednisone ingestion to maximal decrease (7.2 h vs. 9.8 h) or in the maximal decrease (52% vs. 54%). However, the duration of the inhibition was significantly shorter after 2.5 mg than after 10 mg prednisone (approximately 6 h vs. 12 h; (p less than 0.01). We conclude that serum OC is sensitive to small doses of prednisone, and that serial serum OC measurements may be a sensitive marker of the effect of exogenous glucocorticoids on osteoblastic activity in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether endogenous androgens influence bone density in young women, we studied 27 normal women and 19 women with androgen excess, as defined by increased serum bioavailable testosterone (bio T) concentrations. The women ranged from 21-48 yr of age. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to age, anthropomorphic measures, nutrition, gynecological history, and serum cortisol and estradiol levels. Trabecular (lumbar) and cortical (radial) bone density were quantitated by computerized tomography and single photon absorptiometry, respectively. Serum obtained during the follicular phase of the cycle was assayed for bio T, total T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione (Adione), and 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3-Adiol-G). Trabecular bone density was significantly higher in the androgen excess group [172 +/- 7 (+/- SE) vs. 153 +/- 5 mg/mL; P = 0.03]; controlling for serum Adione (but not for serum bio T, total T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide, or 3-Adiol-G) abolished this difference. Similarly, serum Adione correlated more strongly than the other androgens with trabecular bone density (r = 0.31; P = 0.03). Average cortical bone density was not higher in the androgen excess group (0.740 +/- 0.014 vs. 0.722 +/- 0.008 g/cm2; P = 0.27). Among the 27 normal women, cortical density was correlated to serum bio T (r = 0.47; P = 0.01) and total T (r = 0.53; P = 0.004), but not to the other androgens. We conclude that supraphysiological levels of endogenous androgens are associated with increased trabecular bone density in young women. Serum Adione appeared to be the best marker for the impact of androgen on trabecular density. Among normal women, cortical bone density was related to serum T.\r"

Lipid A, the biologically active component of bacterial endotoxin, exerts a number of biochemical effects on responsive cell types. Evidence is presented that lipid A stimulates the synthesis and subsequent myristyl acylation of intracellular monocyte and glomerular mesangial cell proteins. Two of the myristylated monocyte proteins were identified by specific immunoprecipitation as the 33-kD IL 1 alpha and beta precursors; a similar myristylated protein was found in mesangial cells. The 17-kD secretory form of monocyte IL 1 beta did not contain covalently linked myristate. Myristyl acylation of the IL 1 precursor proteins may facilitate the processing or membrane localization of these proteins, which lack characteristic hydrophobic signal sequences. The acylated 33-kD IL 1 alpha may remain preferentially associated with the membrane in an active form, whereas limited proteolysis may convert the biologically inactive IL 1 beta precursor into the extracellular, nonacylated, active 17-kD protein.\r"

Markedly reduced levels of plasma and intrahepatic C-II apolipoprotein were demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Northern, slot blot, and in situ hybridization studies revealed low levels of a normal-sized apo C-II mRNA. No major rearrangement of the apo C-II gene was detected by Southern blotting. Sequence analysis of apo C-II genomic clones revealed a G-to-C substitution within the donor splice site of intron II. This base substitution resulted in the formation of a new Dde I and loss of a Hph I restriction enzyme cleavage site. Amplification of the mutant sequence by the polymerase chain reaction and digestion with Dde I and Hph I restriction enzymes established that the patient was homozygous for the G-to-C mutation. This is the initial report of the DNA sequence of an abnormal apo C-II gene from a patient with deficiency of apo C-II. We propose that this donor splice site mutation is the primary genetic defect that leads to defective splicing and ultimately to an apo C-II deficiency in this kindred.\r"

To test for a possible role for endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) (EDRF) in the hypoxic pressor response, isolated, whole blood-perfused rat lungs from male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with meclofenamate were prepared. Three protocols were performed, including: (a) normal saline (control); (b) the putative EDRF inhibitors, eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA, 1 X 10(-4) M) or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, 1 X 10(-4) M) versus vehicle DMSO; and (c) the putative EDRF inhibitor hydroquinone (HQ, 1 X 10(-4) M) versus vehicle ethyl alcohol (ETOH). The pulmonary pressor response to angiotensin II (Ang II, 0.25 micrograms) injections alternated with 6-min periods of hypoxic ventilation (3% O2, 5% CO2) was measured before and after the administration of saline, inhibitors, or vehicles. The administration of the EDRF inhibitors ETYA, NDGA, and HQ resulted in a marked accentuation of the hypoxic pressor response that was not seen in the controls (P less than 0.05). In separate experiments, lungs precontracted with norepinephrine (1 X 10(-6) M) were pretreated with edrophonium (1 X 10(-4) M) and then observed for endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine at increasing doses (1 X 10(-7)-1 X 10(-4) M). Administration of ETYA, NDGA, or HQ abrogated the observed vasodilatation to acetylcholine, which was not seen with vehicles alone (P less than 0.01). These studies suggest an important role for the endothelium in pulmonary vascular responsiveness to alveolar hypoxia through possible release of a relaxing factor(s) that attenuates the degree of pulmonary arterial constriction.\r"

One monocyte/macrophage Fc gamma receptor, Fc gamma RI, the binding site for monomeric IgG, appears to be especially responsive to modulatory signals by hormones and mediators. Since Factor XIIa is generated during inflammation, we studied the effect of XIIa on Fc gamma RI. Factor XIIa, in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-0.19 microM), reduced the number of monocyte binding sites for monomeric IgG up to 80% without altering the affinity of binding. Its precursor, Factor XII, and the low molecular weight fragment of XIIa, lacking most of the heavy chain region, did not reduce the expression of Fc gamma RI. Neither corn trypsin inhibitor (36 microM) nor diisopropylfluorophosphate (3.6 mM) diminished the effect of Factor XIIa on Fc gamma RI, although each completely inhibited the coagulant and amidolytic activity contained on the light chain of Factor XIIa. Protein synthesis was not a requirement for this effect of Factor XIIa, nor was internalization of Fc gamma RI necessary. In contrast to similar concentrations of IgG, Factor XIIa failed to displace significantly monomeric IgG from the monocyte surface, suggesting that Factor XIIa does not directly compete for Fc gamma RI. The data suggest that the heavy chain of XIIa, which contains domains that may have cell hormone activity, also contains a domain that regulates Fc gamma RI on monocytes. In addition to other hormones and mediators, Factor XIIa may serve a regulatory function in modulating Fc gamma receptor expression during inflammation.\r"

Using in vivo NMR, the initial postischemic recovery of ATP increased with the magnitude of the residual nucleotide pool at the end of ischemia. ATP levels after 120 min of reflow correlated with functional recovery at 24 h. In the present study the effect of blocking the degradation of ATP during ischemia upon the postischemic restoration of ATP was investigated. Inhibition of adenosine deaminase by 80% with the tight-binding inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin led to a 20% increase in the residual adenine nucleotide pool. This increased the ATP initial recovery after 45 min of ischemia from 52% (in controls) to 62% (in the treated animals), as compared to the basal levels. The inhibition also caused an accelerated postischemic restoration of cellular ATP so that at 120 min it was 83% in treated rats vs. 63% in untreated animals. There was a corresponding improvement in the functional recovery from the insult (increase of 33% in inulin clearance 24 h after the injury). Inhibition of adenosine deaminase during ischemia results in a injury similar to that seen after a shorter period of insult.\r"

Utilizing the induction of hapten altered self-reactive CTL as a model for virus or tumor-specific cell-mediated immunity, we determined that the presence of small numbers of clone 86 cells markedly amplified the generation of hapten altered self-reactive CTL. The killer cells induced belong to the CD4-, CD8+ subset, are specific for the hapten-modified autologous stimulator cells present in culture, and are MHC class I restricted. The CTL induced under these culture conditions are readily expanded in the presence of IL-2 with maintenance of efficient and specific altered self-killing. Of interest, clone 86 cells preferentially enhance the growth of CD8+ T cells and selectively amplify altered self-cytolysis but not NK cell activity. Although in vitro clone 86 cells mediate help for CTL generation via the production of lymphokines (IL-4 but little IL-2), one can envision immunotherapeutic strategies for human disease that involve the adoptive transfer of Th cells functionally analogous to clone 86.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophil (PMN) attachment to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was evaluated in vitro using two MAbs, R6-5-D6 and RR1/1, that recognize intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and one MAb, TS1/18, that recognizes CD18. Pretreatment of the HUVEC with anti-ICAM-1 MAbs produced greater than 50% inhibition of attachment to HUVEC, and IL-1 (0.5 U/ml)- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/ml)-stimulated HUVEC, and greater than 99% inhibition of f-Met-Leu-Phe (0.5 nM) enhanced adherence. Anti-ICAM-1 MAbs also inhibited by greater than 85% the transendothelial migration induced by 4-h IL-1 (0.5 U/ml) and LPS (10 ng/ml) activation of the HUVEC. That these effects involved a CD18-dependent mechanism is supported by the following results: pretreatment of PMN with TS1/18 produced the same degree of inhibition of attachment and migration as seen with R6-5-D6. In addition, the use of both MAbs together did not further increase the inhibition of cell attachment to stimulated HUVEC. The attachment of PMN from patients with CD18 deficiency to stimulated HUVEC was not reduced by R6-5-D6, and both R6-5-D6 and TS1/18 revealed the same time course for appearance and disappearance of an adherence component on stimulated HUVEC not blocked by either MAb. These results demonstrate that attachment and transendothelial migration of PMN in vitro depend substantially on both CD18 on the PMN and ICAM-1 on the endothelial cell.\r"

  ".W": "2'-Deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, was administered to three patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma refractory to multiple treatment modalities. Patient 1, who received 5 mg/m2/day for 3 days at 35- to 71-day intervals, has achieved a complete remission greater than 16 months in duration. Patient 2 had progressive disease despite two courses of 2'-deoxycoformycin at a dose of 5 mg/m2/day for 3 days at 28-day intervals. The third patient, who was treated with 4 mg/m2 2'-deoxycoformycin weekly to biweekly, had an initial response, but the disease progressed after eight treatments. Only one patient had any side effects: Patient 1 developed reversible episcleritis, mild elevation of liver enzymes, and persistent nausea and vomiting. In red blood cells of all patients, there was near complete inhibition of adenosine deaminase (91% to 96%) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (89% to 95%) activities with treatment. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, adenosine deaminase was inhibited by 85% to 98% and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase by 51% to 88%. The deoxyadenosine triphosphate level, reflected by the total cellular adenine deoxyribonucleotide measurement in erythrocytes, was noted to be modestly elevated during treatment, with the highest level in the patient who demonstrated the only complete response and the only toxic effects. Low-dose 2'-deoxycoformycin appears to be safe but may be an insufficiently intensive regimen to treat refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma. With proper biochemical monitoring, higher doses may be both safe and more effective.\r"

Nine patients had lesions in the upper, four in the lower, and two in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Ten patients with angiodysplasia experienced more than one bleeding episode during that time. Active hemorrhage from a vascular lesion was seen in nine patients (60%). Erosive gastritis and/or duodenitis was the second most common finding. These data confirm how frequent a cause of recurrent bleeding angiodysplasia is in patients with CRF undergoing dialysis.\r"

In 85% of the patients, both clinical and fecal measurements of Crohn's disease activity agreed (kappa = 0.368, p = 0.011). Similar agreement occurred in those with colitis (kappa = 0.385, p = 0.035) or ileitis (binomial, p less than 0.001) and those with (binomial, p = 0.006) or without (kappa = 0.492, p = 0.01) prior surgery. There was a reduction in the mean clinical score and fecal levels among all patient groups after treatment. There was good agreement between both disease activity measurements after medical therapy. However, even after apparent surgical \"cure,\" fecal protein levels generally remained at values consistent with diffuse occult intestinal disease. When surgical removal of all diseased bowel was not possible, fecal measurements again appeared superior to clinical assessment in reflecting the residual disease. A good correlation existed between the anatomical extent of disease and fecal levels (r = 0.606, p = 0.028), in contrast to the relationship between extent and clinical score (r = 0.14, p = 0.64). Random fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin determinations provide a measure of the intestinal activity and extent of Crohn's disease. They may be useful in monitoring the response to therapy and the presence of residual disease after surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The Medical Record departments of the five teaching hospitals in Edmonton, plus the 37 community hospitals in the eight census districts of the northern half of the province of Alberta, Canada, were contacted, and a search was made of all patients with a discharge diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Also, the patient records of all Edmonton gastroenterologists were reviewed to discover patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis who had never been hospitalized within these census areas. From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1981 (which was the prevalence date), the population was 1,295,360. Of the 2,419 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 48.5% had definite Crohn's disease and 33% had definite ulcerative colitis. There were 1,716 (70.9%) patients analyzed in this study. The factorial analysis of disease prevalence per 10(5) population revealed that significant differences were found for location of residence, sex, and age. The prevalence of Crohn's disease was higher in urban than in rural areas and in females than in males, whereas the prevalence of ulcerative colitis was unaffected by these variables. The peak prevalence of Crohn's disease was below age 29 in males and females, and the prevalence in young women at this age was approximately twice that in males. The highest prevalence of Crohn's disease was in urban females aged 20-39 (greater than 234 cases/10(5) population), with similar prevalence rates in urban males and rural females, and with the lowest prevalence rates in rural males. The incidence of Crohn's disease was greater than for ulcerative colitis, began to increase in about 1965, and reached a plateau in the late 1970s. In conclusion, the demonstration of an age, location of residence, or effect of sex on the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease requires multiple factorial analyses. When the sample is extrapolated to the total diseased population of the region, a prevalence value of 330/10(5) was derived for young female urban individuals residing in this northern area.\r"

We found that a single dose of 40% alcohol produces exfoliation of the surface epithelium, damage to the mucosal microvessels, extravasation of red blood cells and plasma from disrupted microvessels, and extensive edema of superficial lamina propria. The ultrastructural changes were seen as early as 5 min after alcohol administration and occurred in the mucosal areas where glandular cells did not show necrotic changes. Alcohol-induced injury was localized predominantly to interfoveolar mucosal areas and only occasionally extended to the neck areas. This study demonstrates that the mucosal microvasculature is a primary target for alcohol-induced injury of the human gastric mucosa.\r"

This was also true in gastric injury induced by 0.4 N HCl under pretreatment with indomethacin to reduce gastric mucosal prostaglandins (PGs). Somatostatin (SLI), PGE2, and PAS-stained mucus in the corpus were significantly reduced in SMR rats in comparison to SMR + EGF and control rats. In clinical studies, salivary EGF secretion was much higher in peptic ulcer patients than healthy controls. beta-Urogastrone was effective in the treatment of gastric ulcers. On the basis of experimental studies, we conclude that the protective effect of EGF on the gastric mucosa is, in part, mediated indirectly by increases in SLI, PGE2, and mucus production. However, endogenous, as well as exogenous, EGF has an important direct, cytoprotective effect on the gastric mucosa. From the clinical studies, we also conclude that salivary EGF secretion in ulcer patients increases in a homeostatic response to the presence of an ulcer, facilitating ulcer healing. Furthermore, we believe that beta-urogastrone, human EGF, might prove to be an effective drug in the clinical treatment of gastric ulcers.\r"

We show here that when the same target cells are subjected to cytolytic attack by perforin-deficient CTL, either human CTL or primary mouse CTL from peritoneal exudates, the same changes are observed, suggesting that perforin-rich and perforin-deficient CTL kill their target cells by similar (if not identical) mechanisms. It is possible that perforin-deficient CTL produce enough perforin to destroy target cells but not enough to be detected by currently available methods.\r"
