The sources and effects of uncertainty in medical decision making are examined and some new quantitative approaches for solving the associated problems are outlined. To handle uncertainty in the branching probabilities and node utilities for probability trees representing alternative treatment strategies, a public domain software package that can be used for the construction, analysis and comparison of probability trees with random parameters was developed. To facilitate specification of the random variables that arise in medical decision making problems, public domain software packages for both data-driven and subjective estimation of probability densities from the Johnson translation system of distributions have also been developed. For the analysis of complex problems that cannot be adequately represented by probability trees or by simple stochastic processes such as Markov chains, network simulation approaches that are oriented toward the sequence of activities seen by individual patients in the course of treatment are described.\r"

The conflict is between containing costs on an aggregate level while, at the same time, not reducing services to the individual if the services are essential for quality care. There is little information on which to base decisions about the value of services. Health care organizations and delivery models must be restructured because current models are out of date. To accomplish this restructuring, better information is needed on why hospitals and doctors do what they do. Success in developing information and decision models that result in patients receiving only medically necessary services will contribute greatly to promoting high quality, cost-conscious care.\r"

All of this can be accomplished in terms of patient outcome and without the bias and self-interest of which the profession has been accused. Furthermore, if a resource allocation or reimbursement decision made in the name of cost containment eliminates or limits access to effective diagnostic or therapeutic technologies, the impact of that decision on effective care can be explicitly and quantitatively expressed through decision modeling. When such analyses are based on patient outcome, they are difficult to ignore and provide a pivotal point for discussions and eventual compromise.\r"

There is a substantial change in myosin isozyme content of the heart, but little or no change in skeletal muscle fiber type distribution in specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier-protected rats. These changes (or lack of them) are reflected in functional differences (or lack of them) in the target tissues. The most obvious difference between the recent studies showing no differences with age in skeletal muscle fiber distribution and previous reports of general decreases with age in content of fast fibers is in animal housing conditions; all of the animals showing an age-related change had been housed in conventional colonies, while those exhibiting little or no change were in SPF barrier-protected facilities.\r"

No consistent differences in pulmonary bacterial clearance were observed in uninfected animals of either age group. However, both young and aged virus-infected mice consistently exhibited significantly reduced ability to clear challenge bacteria from their lungs compared to age-matched nonvirus-infected controls; this deficit was markedly more pronounced in virus-infected aged mice. The extra deficit seen in virus-infected aged animals did not correlate with pulmonary virus or interferon titers, or with severity of pulmonary histopathology. Moreover, the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of pulmonary macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophiles from virus-infected young and aged mice were comparable.\r"

Several methods have been used to test for the presence of synergistic interactions, but virtually all are either very time consuming or nonstandardized. With combinations of cell wall-active agents plus aminoglycosides, bactericidal synergism has been associated with enhanced intracellular uptake of the aminoglycoside. Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with beta-lactams susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis have yielded synergistic activity against a number of common pathogens. The example of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole illustrates the potential value of combination of drugs acting at proximate steps along a single metabolic pathway. By analogy, combinations of antimicrobials active at various steps in peptidoglycan synthesis might also result in synergistic interactions. Use of certain drug combinations does pose the risk, however, of unwanted antagonistic interactions. The clinical importance of synergism in the treatment of bacterial infections has been documented in only a few limited circumstances.\r"

Most currently available data fit into the anecdotal category--there are no standard assays for determination of immune inhibition or enhancement. Most studies were performed in vitro; minimal correlation is made between the mode of action and the intracellular penetration of the test antibiotics, and mechanisms of noted effects are largely unexamined and unexplained. Thus, the observations are frequently contradictory and difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, it has become apparent that certain antibiotics do have potent immunomodulating actions. The clinical impact of such immunomodulation is unknown, since few studies have been performed in patients receiving antibiotics and virtually no studies have examined the effect of antibiotics on the immune system of those at highest risk for sustaining an adverse effect, the immunocompromised patient. Well-planned studies on antimicrobial action, adapting the rapidly expanding knowledge of the immune system currently being generated and utilizing the advances in technology for scrutiny of immune affectors, are badly needed. With a better understanding of the effects of such agents on host cells as well as target cells, it is conceivable that in the future antibiotic therapy will consist of regimens that provide not only optimal anti-infective therapy but also optimal immunomodulating support.\r"

For most antimicrobial agents, the major determinant of passage aside from serum protein binding is the degree of lipid-solubility of the drug. The beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics and vancomycin penetrate the central nervous system relatively poorly, whereas chloramphenicol, metronidazole, the fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole fare better.

The emergence of resistant microorganism has led to the development of newer penicillin compounds that have extended spectrums of antimicrobial activity. Beta-lactamase production by many pathogenic bacteria is the most common and clinically relevant mechanism of antibiotic resistance. The addition of beta-lactamase inhibitors to penicillin antibiotics has proven to be successful in preventing the inactivation of the parent penicillin compound by the more commonly produced beta-lactamase enzymes.\r"

The majority of strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus are susceptible, including strains resistant to aminoglycosides, anti-Pseudomonas penicillins, and other cephalosporins. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is susceptible to a subgroup of third generation agents including ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and the experimental agents cefpirome and cefpiramide. Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is excellent especially for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftizoxime. These agents are safe, sharing most of the known toxicities of other beta-lactam compounds. Their greatest use is in the therapy of difficult to treat gram-negative bacterial infections, including meningitis, nosocomial infections, and infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\r"

Its most accepted indication appears to be in gram-negative bacillary infections in the penicillin-allergic individual where one might ordinarily use an extended spectrum penicillin or a third generation cephalosporin. In all individuals its clinical efficacy appears similar to that of the aminoglycosides, not clinically superior but offering a higher therapeutic index by virtue of its lack of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Its second application, therefore, is as an aminoglycoside-sparing agent even for multiresistant gram-negative bacillary infections, and although by no means inexpensive it offers an efficacious and safe alternative to aminoglycosides in the elderly and other patients with renal insufficiency. Aztreonam can be used effectively in combination with non-beta-lactam agents for mixed infections, even though it is not synergistic in vitro with vancomycin and clindamycin.\r"

Intact sebaceous glands were isolated from full-thickness human skin after incubation in dispase (2.4 U/ml) and in deoxyribonuclease (0.02%) by using microsurgical instruments under microscopical observation of the epidermal underface. Subsequently, the ducts of the glands were removed, the isolated gland lobules were seeded on a 3T3-cell feeder layer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F 12 medium (3:1) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), L-glutamine, antibiotics, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.4 microgram/ml), and cholera toxin (10(-9) M), and were then cultivated in a CO2-incubator at 37 degrees C. After 2-3 wk cell outgrowths resulting from the periphery of the gland lobules were obtained and dispersed cells were passaged for three subcultures with or without 3T3-cell feeder layer. The cultured cells preserved in vitro morphologic characteristics and differentiation patterns comparable to those described for normal human sebocytes in vivo, with a high rate of viable cells. Their labeling pattern with MoAb showed close similarities to the pattern reported for sebocytes in vivo but differences to the pattern of keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro. In their cytoplasm oil red and nile red stained droplets were detected, and the observed density and distribution evidenced in vitro lipogenesis. The technique presented here may provide a promising model for further experimental studies on sebaceous gland cell development and function.\r"

A high degree of differentiation of reconstituted epidermis did not require basement membrane as shown by the development of basal, spinous, and granular cell layers, and synthesis of 58 and 65-67 kDa keratins when epidermis was attached directly to dermis. On the other hand, we found that the basement membrane regulated the adhesive interaction between the epidermis and dermis. On dermis with basement membrane, attached epidermal cells formed hemidesmosomes and mechanically stable bonding. In the absence of basement membrane, the epidermal cells did not form hemidesmosomes, and bonding between the epidermis and dermis was unstable. Moreover, dermis from which the basement membrane was removed was reorganized by the epidermal cell layer.\r"

This view is predicated on the results of epidemiologic observations, experiments in animals, investigations at the cellular level, and the results from dietary intervention trials. In the past decade a considerable body of new evidence has been gathered. A comprehensive, world-wide epidemiologic investigation involving over 10,000 subjects found significant relationships between sodium excretion and blood pressure levels and between sodium excretion and the slope of increase in blood pressure with age. The relationships, however, are not as straight-forward as previously proposed. Investigations in animals and in human subjects emphasize the genetic nature of salt sensitivity of blood pressure. A putative genetic marker has been suggested in human studies. At the cellular level, increases in sodium-lithium countertransport, sodium-hydrogen exchange, and cytosolic calcium level have been identified. Cytosolic calcium level was found to increase in lymphocytes in response to a high-salt diet in salt-sensitive individuals with hypertension, yet the identification of a circulating inhibitor of sodium-potassium--dependent adenosine triphosphatase remains elusive. Dietary intervention trials of salt restriction in patients with hypertension are generally disappointing. Active research is elucidating the role of sodium intake and hypertension at all levels. The data to date, however, still do not allow sweeping conclusions or generalizations.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphodiesterase inhibition promotes both cellular uptake and release of calcium, which should thus facilitate both myocardial relaxation and myocardial contraction. To test the hypothesis that phosphodiesterase inhibition augments both diastolic and systolic ventricular function, parameters of left ventricular ejection and filling were measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy before and after therapy with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone. Baseline radionuclide ventriculography was performed in all subjects with derivation of left ventricular ejection fraction and peak diastolic filling rate. These parameters were again assessed after 3 months of therapy with either placebo (six patients) or enoximone (seven patients). Ejection fraction increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the enoximone group (change from baseline = 11 +/- 14 ejection fraction units) but did not change in the placebo group (0.2 +/- 5 ejection fraction units). Enoximone administration was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in peak filling rate, from 0.9 +/- 0.5 to 1.4 +/- 0.5 end-diastolic volumes per second, which was noted in the placebo group (1.2 +/- 0.6 to 1.4 +/- 0.9 end-diastolic volumes per second; p = not significant). Thus, in comparison with placebo, exoximone augmented both diastolic and systolic function in dilated cardiomyopathy. This identifies an additional influence of this class of inotropic agent on the function of the intact ventricle that is consistent with previously described cellular mechanisms and that may significantly contribute to a restoration of normal hemodynamic status in dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

In an immunoelectron microscopic study, the primary localizations of beta-microseminoprotein and gamma-seminoprotein in the cell were demonstrated to be secretory granule and lysosome, respectively, suggesting that beta-microseminoprotein is a secretory protein. Weak distributions of beta-microseminoprotein and gamma-seminoprotein were observed in rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In spermatozoa, beta-microseminprotein was found attached to the cell membrane of the head but not in the tail, and gamma-seminoprotein was not found at all.\r"

  ".W": "The demonstration of elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a valuable aid in the serodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). It is important to recognize cases of ABPA, because repeated untreated episodes of pulmonary infiltrates can result in bronchiectasis and even fatal fibrotic lung disease. Serum samples from patients with ABPA have increased isotypic antibodies to Af when compared with patients with asthma and immediate cutaneous reactivity but in whom ABPA has been excluded. There is little information regarding age-related changes of isotypic antibodies to a specific allergen or in comparison of such changes with age-related changes in total class-specific antibody. We determined IgE-Af, IgG-Af, and IgA-Af and total IgE, IgG, and IgA concentrations in serum samples from children with asthma (ages less than 1 through 5 years, 6 through 10 years, and 11 through 15 years) and compared the results with those in children with APBA and adults with asthma. The use of an indirect amplified ELISA with Af adsorbed to microtiter wells demonstrated that serum samples from children with ABPA have elevated IgE-Af, IgG-Af, and IgA-Af concentrations compared with those in serum samples from children with asthma. The assays were sensitive and highly specific in discriminating ABPA from asthma in children. Isotypic antibodies to Af in children do not demonstrate age-related increases as occur for total serum IgE, IgG, and IgA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this assay, free paranitroaniline, cleaved from synthetic chromogenic substrates by proteases that were generated by Limulus lysate after incubation with endotoxin, was then derived. Derivation was with p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde in the presence of strong acid, forming a stable Schiff base end product with much greater molar absorbancy than the parent chromogen. Conditions (times and temperatures of incubations, concentrations of reagents) for the augmented chromogenic procedure were optimized. A ten-fold or greater increase in sensitivity for bacterial endotoxin was obtained with the modified assay as compared with the standard chromogenic Limulus test, with unequivocal detection of endotoxin concentrations of less than 100 pg/ml. The greater sensitivity of this modified Limulus test increases its usefulness for a wide range of research applications and clinical investigations.\r"

Radiography missed only two true cases of fluid retention. Accuracy of diagnosis by radiography was 87 per cent. Initial ultrasonography gave a sign of retained secretion in 127 cases, of which 122 (96 per cent) were true positive. However, 18 (13 per cent) tracings of the 140 sinuses with secretion gave wrong negative findings. Accuracy of diagnosis by ultrasonography was 86 per cent.

In the patients with established kidney function, protein C coagulant activity was higher than in patients with impaired graft function. Furthermore, it seems that the protein C coagulant activity was closely related to changes in graft function in the 11 patients with graft rejection episodes. The low protein C coagulant activity following renal transplantation could be a contributing factor to thromboembolic complications.\r"

During a 3-year period the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were reduced to a greater extent (P = 0.00001) in the ICT group (from 9.5 +/- 0.2 to 7.4%, P = 0.0001) than in the RT group (9.4 +/- 0.2 to 9.0 +/- 0.2, P = 0.004). The urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) increased significantly (P = 0.033) in the RT group but not in the ICT group, and the UAER differed significantly (P = 0.031) between the groups after 3 years. The mean HbA1c values during the study period independently influenced the deterioration of UAER levels (P = 0.029). Initial diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.112), the HbA1c value at entry (P = 0.480) and the smoking habits (P = 0.959) were not related to change of UAER levels. Manifest nephropathy after 3 years was seen almost exclusively in patients with HbA1c levels above 9%. Improved blood glucose control, without 'near normoglycaemia', delayed the progression of nephropathy in patients with IDDM and retinopathy.\r"

Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were significantly decreased for the degree of anaemia (22.0 +/- 7.6 mUnits (U) ml-1). Initially all patients received 120 U kg-1 of rhEpo intravenously three times a week and after a period of 45 days the haematocrit rose from 25 +/- 3 to 36 +/- 5. A reduced dose of 30 U kg-1 was then instituted which stabilized the haematocrit at this level. The development of anti-erythropoietin antibodies to rhEpo could not be demonstrated. Endogenous serum erythropoietin levels remained unchanged during therapy with rhEpo. The serum ferritin concentration, which was initially 3118 +/- 1556 micrograms l-1, was significantly reduced to 2203 +/- 1299 micrograms l-1 after an 80-d treatment period. The side-effects in three patients included the occasional sensation of increased body heat without fever. In one previously hypertensive patient the antihypertensive therapy had to be temporarily increased, but otherwise both the mean diastolic and systolic blood pressure remained constant during the observation period. No clotting of arteriovenous fistulas occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The borderline personality was originally thought to be on the border of psychosis and treatability. Most psychoanalytic writers of the 1940s-1960s gave these patients subschizophrenic labels and emphasized a supportive, limited treatment approach. They noted that these patients often regressed and became worse with analytic treatment. Nevertheless, in the 1970s a major impetus for a renaissance and revitalization of psychoanalytic thought was a recasting of the theory and therapy of the borderline personality. Renewed optimism and vigor characterized the intensive, exploratory treatment approaches to these writings. The 1980s, however, curiously show a fragmentation of and retrenchment from these views, and a return to many of the treatment recommendations of the earlier authors. The literature on the treatment of the borderline personality is critically examined from a historical perspective in this review. Highlighted, in particular, are the commonalities, trends, empirical studies, and future directions in the treatment literature.\r"

Experimental and/or clinical work related to hypnosis, rapid eye movement phenomena, dreams, and hemispheric specialization are discussed to support this view. Dreams are described within the context of dissociation-based theories of personality organization. Brain behavior relationships are emphasized whenever possible.\r"

Miniature membrane plasma separators coupled with a Protein A (PA)-Sepharose immunoadsorbent column were used to perform upon conscious rabbits 5 IgG immunoadsorption treatments over 6 days. Quantitation of anti-myelin IgG and IgM by ELISA revealed that 55-65% of plasma IgG was removed per treatment. Rapid post-treatment antibody rebound was observed for anti-myelin IgG although no antibody overshoot above control levels could be observed. Anti-myelin IgM levels remained relatively unaffected by PA immunoadsorption. Comparisons of clinical scores between control and treatment animals showed that IgG immunoadsorption was significantly beneficial (day 1 post-treatment p less than 0.001; day 2 post-treatment p less than 0.05). However, rapid relapse was observed in all treatment animals such that by day 3 post-treatment no significant clinical difference between control and treatment groups could be observed. IgG immunoadsorption suppresses the clinical progression of chronic EAN in a manner similar to that seen with plasma exchange. This finding suggests that antibody modulates early disease pathogenesis.\r"

For sophisticated alarms, information about the inputs to the patient is of importance; for example, clinical interventions such as drug administration and ventilation readjustment need to be known to the monitoring system. Alarms are triggered by signals or signal features that exceed thresholds. Each threshold must be seen as a level that needs to be set, either manually or automatically. The large number of levels to be set creates an extra workload for the clinician. Approaches to determine such levels automatically are discussed in this article. Most promising seems the multiple signal approach using an expert system. It seems reasonable to expect that information concerning alarm limits, needed for the operation of knowledge-based alarm systems, may come from integrated departmental data bases.\r"

Follow-up on 142 patients was updated and a variety of potential pretreatment prognostic factors were analyzed for impact on outcome. One hundred forty patients (99%) achieved a complete remission and there were no differences in outcome between institutions. Twenty-three patients have relapsed and 22 have died from lymphoma at a median follow-up of 4.4 years, resulting in an overall relapse-free survival of 82% at 5 years. There was no treatment-related mortality and were no instances of late cardiac toxicity or leukemia. Of the following potential pretreatment prognostic factors (age, stage, \"B\" symptoms, extranodal disease, gastrointestinal tract involvement, bulky disease, or disease above or below the diaphragm), only stage affected relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = .16) and survival (.003). Among 34% of patients over age 65, outcome was similar to younger patients.

We studied 100 consecutive patient-physician encounters about adjuvant therapy to determine how well we informed patients about benefits and risks and how clearly we recommended treatment. Evaluation included observation and audiorecording of encounters, patient- and physician-completed questionnaires, and patient interviews. Patient-physician agreement on the benefits and risks of adjuvant therapy was poor. Sixty percent of patients overestimated their chance of cure by 20% or more compared with the physician. Poor agreement was partially explained by the observation that patients and physicians exchanged little specific information. Furthermore, decision-making was compressed. Although this was the first meeting with a medical oncologist for 79 patients (79%), 82 (82%) made final decisions about treatment by the end of the meeting. Physicians clearly identified their recommended treatment. Patients generally followed the physician's recommendation, except when clinical trials were recommended. Only 45% of trial-eligible patients chose to participate in offered trials. Physician recommendations of clinical trials were not as effectively communicated as nontrial treatments. Nonstandard adjuvant regimens, similar to the experimental arm of some ongoing randomized trials, were recommended to 30% of patients, especially those with a poor prognosis. In essence, physicians acted as if the trial question was answered, thereby diminishing enthusiasm for the trial. The widespread recommendation of nonstandard regimens similar or identical to the experimental arms in ongoing trials suggests a serious lack of consensus on what questions to ask in clinical trials and whether or not those questions have been answered.\r"

Recently, a group of oncologists conducting clinical trials in patients with AIDS-associated KS as part of a cooperative group established by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) drafted such criteria. The criteria take into account the unique problems associated with the evaluation of patients with a disseminated cutaneous neoplasm in the setting of a systemic virus infection associated with immune deficiency. The recommendations include a standardized format for documenting the extent of KS on initial and subsequent evaluations, response definitions that include assessments of lesion nodularity and tumor-associated edema in addition to more traditional methods for evaluating tumor response, and a new staging system that includes extent of tumor, immune status, and other AIDS-related disease manifestations, akin to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system used to stage other tumors. The adoption of standardized criteria for the evaluation of KS should prove useful for group trials and for other investigators involved in the treatment of this disease.\r"

In 88 patients, parameters related to economic status, sexual activity, pain, limb function, and global quality of life (QOL) were recorded prior to surgery and every 6 months postoperatively. Changes from the preoperative assessment for every parameter were analyzed in each patient. Six months after surgery, there was a decrease in employment status, sexual activity, and in limb function in a significant number of patients. At 12 months, these decreases were still evident. Despite these changes, global QOL measured by a standardized test showed at least some improvement in a significant proportion of patients at 12 months. These findings highlight the difficulty in defining QOL. It could not be ascertained if radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy were causative factors in specific changes because of the small numbers of patients in each subgroup. However, among 60 patients with high-grade sarcomas, significant wound problems developed in 10 of 33 who received postoperative radiation therapy in combination with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy compared with one of 27 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone (P = .016). Also, among high-grade sarcoma patients with 12-month follow-up, six of 19 patients who received radiation therapy and chemotherapy developed joint contractures compared with zero of 15 patients who received chemotherapy alone (P less than .04). The combination of postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy appeared to be associated with significantly more tissue-related injury in patients with high-grade sarcomas compared with chemotherapy alone.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred forty-one women with operable breast cancer with histologically positive axillary nodes were randomized to receive either combination cyclophosphamide (60 mg/m2 orally everyday for 1 year); fluorouracil (300 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] weekly for 1 year); methotrexate (15 mg/m2 IV weekly for 1 year); vincristine (0.625 mg/m2 IV for 10 weeks); prednisone (30 mg/m2 orally days 1 to 14, 20 mg/m2 days 15 to 28, 10 mg/m2 days 29 to 42) (CMFVP) or single-agent melphalan (L-PAM) (5 mg/m2 orally every day for 5 days every 6 weeks for 2 years) chemotherapy after a modified or radical mastectomy between January 1975 and February 1978. Patients were stratified according to menopausal status and number of positive nodes (one to three, more than three nodes) before randomization. Seventy-eight patients were ineligible, most (56) because they were registered more than 42 days from surgery. Maximum duration of follow-up is 12 years, with a median of 9.8 years. The treatment arms were balanced with respect to age, menopausal status, and number of positive nodes. Among eligible patients, disease-free survival and survival were superior with CMFVP (P = .002, .005, respectively). At 10 years, 48% of patients treated with CMFVP remain alive and disease-free and 56% remain alive, compared with 35% alive and disease-free and 43% alive on the L-PAM arm. Disease-free survival and survival were significantly better with CMFVP compared with L-PAM only in premenopausal patients and patients with four or more positive nodes. Both regimens were well tolerated, although toxicity was more severe and more frequent with CMFVP. We conclude that after 10 years of follow-up, adjuvant combination chemotherapy with CMFVP is superior to single-agent L-PAM in patients with axillary node-positive primary breast cancer. The major advantage is in premenopausal women and in patients with more than three positive axillary nodes.\r"

Twenty-three patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The overall risk of developing MDS or ANLL per person is 1.6%. In patients who had received more than 16,000 mg of DBD the risk per person is 6%, and in the high-dose subsets of patients who received no prior radiation or alkylator therapy, it is 7.9%. The risk per person increases to a maximum by 30 to 36 months (5.3%). The high risk was seen despite a study population of metastatic breast cancer patients with a median survival of 16 months. This analysis strongly suggests that DBD is one of the most potent of the reported leukemogenic-inducing agents. Further use of this drug in both the adjuvant and metastatic situation should be reconsidered.\r"

  ".W": "We report the results of a prospective study in patients more than 65 years of age in whom two different therapeutic strategies were compared: immediate intensive-induction chemotherapy (arm A) versus \"wait and see\" and supportive care and mild cytoreductive chemotherapy only for relief of progressive acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-related symptoms (arm B). The major objective of the study was to compare survival outcome of both regimens. Thirty-one patients on arm A received one or two courses of daunorubicin, vincristine, and cytarabine for remission induction followed by one additional cycle for consolidation in case of complete remission (CR). Among 29 patients on arm B, cytoreductive chemotherapy (hydroxyurea, cytarabine) had to be initiated for palliation of leukemia-associated complications in 21 patients at a median of 9 days after diagnosis. Overall survival duration for patients treated on arm A was significantly (P = .015) longer than the survival in arm B (median survival, 21 weeks v 11 weeks; projected survival at 2.5 years, 13% v 0%). Eighteen (58%) of arm A patients and none (0%) of arm B patients entered CR. Of the first group, projected disease-free survival at 2 years is 17%. The median percentages of days spent in the hospital by arm A and B patients were 55% and 50%, respectively. This study shows that a strategy based on modern supportive care and a wait and see approach yields extremely poor results. It is not superior in regard to the frequency of hospital admission and is inferior regarding survival outcome.\r"

Nineteen patients developed life-threatening (grade 3) or fatal (grade 4) RRT in one or more organs. Grade 3 or 4 RRT was more common in patients with advanced disease versus those transplanted earlier in their course (P = .008), and was more common in patients with advanced disease conditioned with cytarabine (Ara-C)/total body irradiation (TBI) versus those prepared with cyclophosphamide (CY)/TBI (P = .033). There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in autologous, histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-identical, or HLA-mismatched marrow recipients. Grade 3 or 4 RRT tended to be more common and 100-day survival worse in patients with a Karnofsky performance status of less than 90 (P = .063 and .0002, respectively). Patients receiving 20 Gy or more of mediastinal irradiation before coming to transplant had more idiopathic or cytomegalovirus (CMV) interstitial pneumonitis than those who received less than 20 Gy (30% v 9%, P = .027). The probability of survival decreased with the number of organs in which toxicity was observed (P = .0001). Severe or fatal toxicities directly related to the preparative regimen are a significant problem in the treatment of patients with advanced malignant lymphoma and can be reduced by carrying out transplantation earlier in the course of the disease.\r"

Eight CRs (three and five in patients with metastatic and locoregional disease, respectively) were pathologically confirmed. The overall median response duration was 7 months; it was 16 months for patients achieving CR (22 months for pathologically confirmed CR [pCR]), and 6 months for PR. The median survival time for all patients was 9 months, for the patients who achieved CR 17 months, for pCR 23 months, and for PR 9.5 months. Median survival time for all patients with metastatic disease was 8 months, and for locoregional disease 12.5 months. Six patients (9%) (four local, two metastatic disease) were alive at 2 years, and four patients are alive and disease free at 35+ to 56+ months. Main toxicities were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with 64% of patients developing grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression and 12% severe infections.

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of a 6-month course of combination intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide in patients with refractory or recurrent advanced ovarian carcinoma, 67 patients were entered into this prospective, nonrandomized, single-institution trial. Cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 and etoposide at 200 mg/m2 were administered IP on day 1 every month for 6 months. Exploratory laparotomy was performed before protocol entry and was planned after the completion of 6 months of IP therapy to surgically document response. All patients had received prior intravenous (IV) chemotherapy with a cisplatin-based regimen. At protocol entry, 18 (27%) patients had surgically defined residual tumor (maximal tumor diameter) greater than 2.0 cm, 17 (25%) patients greater than 0.5 cm - less than or equal to 2.0 cm, and 32 (48%) patients less than or equal to 0.5 cm. Sixteen patients (24%) who had experienced a treatment-free interval of more than 1 year prior to study entry were considered as having recurrent disease and the remaining 51 (76%) patients were considered as having refractory disease. Toxicity was tolerable: four patients (6%) had nadir fever, three (4%) had culture-documented bacterial peritonitis, five (7%) had IP catheter-related complications, and 27 (40%) had an increase in serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Among the 57 patients who are fully evaluable for response, the overall surgically defined response rate, complete (CR), and partial response (PR), was 40% (23/57), and the CR rate was 21% (12/57). Among the patients with recurrent disease, eight of 13 (62%) responded, with responses seen among all categories of residual disease. Among the patients with refractory disease, 15 of 44 (34%) had surgically documented responses. However, responses were more frequent in patients with residual disease less than 0.5 cm; 11 of 20 (55%) versus four of 24 (17%) with residual greater than 0.5 cm, P = .019 (chi 2, one degree of freedom, Yates correction). The duration of the CRs ranges from 4 to 18+ months. Longer follow-up is needed to determine if there is any impact on survival.\r"

Its cytotoxic action is phase-specific and it has demonstrated schedule dependency in both in vitro and animal studies, but clinical evidence of the importance of drug scheduling is uncertain. The two administration schedules of etoposide that have been compared in this randomized study of 39 patients with previously untreated extensive small-cell lung cancer treated with single-agent etoposide were 500 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24 hours or five consecutive daily 2-hour infusions each of 100 mg/m2. Both regimens were repeated every 3 weeks, for a maximum of six cycles. Patients received combination chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or radiotherapy on failure to respond or at relapse, depending on their Karnofsky performance status. The same therapy was used in both arms of the study. All patients are evaluable for response to etoposide. In the 24-hour arm, two patients achieved a partial remission, resulting in an overall response rate of 10%. In the 5-day schedule, 16 patients had a partial response and one had a complete remission, producing an overall response rate of 89%, which was significantly superior to that in the 24-hour arm (P less than .001). The median duration of remission to etoposide in the 5-day arm was 4.5 months. Bone marrow toxicity was similar in both schedules. Etoposide pharmacokinetics were measured in all patients, and total areas under the concentration versus time curves (AUCs) were equivalent in both regimens. This study has clearly demonstrated the importance of etoposide scheduling in humans, and the superiority of five daily infusions over a 24-hour continuous infusion. The response rate to single-agent etoposide using an efficacious schedule in extensive small-cell lung cancer has been determined to be in excess of 80%.\r"

Significant dose-limiting myelosuppression required CBDCA dose reductions to 300 mg/m2 and, subsequently, 200 mg/m2. Nonhematological toxicities were not significant. Our study objective was to determine whether CBDCA plus MTX produce a substantial improvement in response rate over single-agent MTX. A response rate of 50% (complete [CR] plus partial response [PR]) for CBDCA plus MTX compared with 25% for MTX was specified as the difference to be detected. We employed a two-stage study design for randomized trials that allowed for early termination of studies involving relatively ineffective treatment regimens. With this design, the study could be closed after the first stage (20 patients entered onto each treatment arm) if the number of responders to CBDCA plus MTX were not superior to MTX. Five of 20 patients responded to treatment in each arm, and we were able to conclude that the addition of CBDCA to MTX is unlikely to result in a twofold increase in response rate compared with MTX alone in this group of patients. This two-stage design represents a simple and efficient method of testing the relative efficacy of new combinations containing at least one active agent against a suitable control arm in this disease. It addresses scientific and ethical issues of continuing testing with relatively ineffective treatments, and at the same time provides a reliable method for identifying very active regimens likely to represent significant therapeutic advances.\r"

In 29 of 33 studies (88%), addition of GM-CSF either had no effect on in vitro growth, or induced growth inhibition. While significant growth inhibition was observed in 10 studies, marked inhibition was only observed in three studies. However, all dose-response curves were usually flat, suggesting indirect effects. Moderate growth stimulation was observed in four instances, which may have been due to residual granulocyte-macrophage progenitors within the biopsies. We conclude that GM-CSF has little or no growth-modulatory effect on most nonhematopoietic neoplasms. The primary role of GM-CSF in patients with solid tumors appears to be in prevention or reversal of myelosuppression associated with therapy. Thus, while GM-CSF seems unlikely to have a role in monotherapy of cancer, it is also unlikely to have its utility compromised by enhancement of tumor growth.\r"

The drug was administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 to 120 minutes repeated every 28 days. Ninety-five courses of therapy at doses ranging from 18 to 1,104 mg/m2 were administered to 38 patients with refractory solid tumors. Granulocytopenia was dose limiting. Leukopenia was seen in 13 of 31 courses at doses of 690 mg/m2 or greater. Life-threatening granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 250 microliters) was noted in 1/6 patients treated at 800 mg/m2, 1/8 patients treated at 918 mg/m2, and 2/5 patients treated at 1,104 mg/m2. No definite relationship between myelotoxicity and prior treatment status was noted. Rate-of-infusion dependent, nonhematologic toxicities included diaphoresis, flushing, dizziness, and tinnitus, all of which were ameliorated by increasing the duration of drug infusion to 120 minutes. In addition, nausea and vomiting (grades 1 and 2) were seen in 29/56 courses at doses greater than or equal to 519 mg/m2, but were easily controlled by phenothiazine antiemetics. Amonafide plasma and urine concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentrations declined biexponetially with a terminal harmonic mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) of 5.5 h. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state and total body clearance were 532 L/m2 and 84 L/h/m2, respectively. Less than 5% of the total dose of amonafide was excreted unchanged in the urine. Antitumor activity has been noted in one patient with non-small-cell lung cancer (one complete response exceeding 29 months duration) and in one patient with prostatic cancer (complete pain relief and improvement in bone scan for 9 months). The recommended dose for phase II trials with this schedule of amonafide is 918 mg/m2 with dose escalation to amonafide is 918 mg/m2 with dose escalation to myelotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Blood-pool subtraction has been proposed to enhance 111In-labeled platelet imaging of intracardiac thrombi. We tested the accuracy of labeled platelet imaging, with and without blood-pool subtraction, in ten subjects with cardiac thrombi of varying age, eight with endocarditis being treated with antimicrobial therapy and ten normal controls. Imaging was performed early after labeled platelet injection (24 hr or less) and late (48 hr or more). Blood-pool subtraction was carried out. All images were graded subjectively by four experienced, \"blinded\" readers. Detection accuracy was measured by the sensitivity at three fixed levels of specificity estimated from receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and tested by three-way analysis of variance. Detection accuracy was generally improved on delayed images. Blood-pool subtraction did not improve accuracy. Although blood-pool subtraction increased detection sensitivity, this was offset by decreased specificity. For this population studied, blood-pool subtraction did not improve subjective detection of abnormal platelet deposition by 111In platelet imaging.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the myocardial uptake pattern of 99mTc-labeled methoxyisobutyl isonitrile [( 99mTc] MIBI) and 201TI, planar scintigraphy were performed in both patients with documented coronary artery disease and subjects with a low likelihood of disease. Quantitative analysis was employed using a standard interpolative background subtraction algorithm and a new algorithm modified to better accommodate for the differences in extracardiac activity seen with [99mTc]MIBI rest images. Among patients with coronary artery disease, the standard algorithm yielded no significant difference in relative defect magnitude between [99mTc]MIBI and 201TI on stress scintigrams (p = 0.48), although the magnitude of [99mTc]MIBI defects was greater on resting images (p = 0.02). When the modified algorithm was employed, defect magnitude was similar for both stress (p = 0.91) and rest (p = 0.20) images. Normal segmental uptake ratios derived from a comparison of contralateral segments (e.g., septal:posterolateral) in the low likelihood patients were similar for both [99mTc]MIBI and 201TI. Thus, modification of the standard interpolative background subtraction algorithm is necessary for quantitative planar [99mTc]MIBI perfusion imaging. When appropriate background subtraction is employed, myocardial uptake and quantitative defect magnitude of [99mTc]MIBI and 201TI planar images are similar.\r"

  ".W": "To study the scintigraphic detectability of cardiac rejection, we performed 135 planar myocardial scans ([99mTc]pyrophosphate, 85; 201Tl, 36; 67Ga, 14) together with endomyocardial biopsies in ten patients for a (mean) 17-mo postoperative period. Specificity of each agent exceeded 89%. Technetium-99m pyrophosphate showed results that significantly correlated with the severity of rejection (p = 0.03), as shown by biopsy, but neither 201Tl nor 67Ga did so (p = 0.63 and 0.81, respectively). Technetium-99m pyrophosphate showed better diagnostic accuracy (85%) than 201Tl (69%) and 67Ga (64%). Technetium-99m pyrophosphate also showed higher negative predictive value (91%) than thallium (76%) and gallium (69%). Thus, a normal 99mTc pyrophosphate scan was usually associated with absence of cardiac rejection. However, all three agents showed unacceptably poor sensitivity (0% to 30%) and thus were not useful as a screening test for cardiac rejection, even when the same agent was used serially in imaging a given patient.\r"

No 111In platelet uptake was seen in five of seven normally functioning grafts. Two cases of venous thrombosis and two perigraft hematomas appeared like a focal 111In platelet accumulation. Indium-111-labeled platelet scintigraphy can be a useful method for monitoring pancreas transplants.

All patients had hypokalemic alkalosis, normotension, hyperreninemia, growth retardation, low fractional distal chloride reabsorption (4/5), and elevated urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion (5/6). In addition, all had hypercalciuria (urinary calcium 6.5 to 25.0 mg/kg/day), with evidence of nephrocalcinosis in five. None, however, had evidence of rickets or hyperparathyroidism. There was a marked elevation in the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in all, and four patients had a response to oral calcium loading suggestive of absorptive hypercalciuria. Five children have had long-term therapy with indomethacin. They have had improvement in hypokalemia and reduced urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion as well as reductions in the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and in urinary calcium excretion. These data suggest that hypercalciuria in some children with Bartter syndrome is associated with an excess of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The improvement in hypercalciuria with prostaglandin synthesis inhibition may result in part from correction of this vitamin D abnormality.\r"

A suckling rat model was used to compare the impact of penicillin (150 mg/kg) with albumin control, high-dose IVIG (2.7 gm/kg), or low-dose IVIG (0.68 gm/kg) on survival and bacteremia. Three lots of IVIG (two standard and one hyperimmune) with varying titers of GBS type III activity were used. An opsonophagocytic assay was then employed to evaluate in vitro the effect of concentrations of penicillin (none to 2.4 micrograms/ml), IVIG (none to 20 mg/ml), organism-specific (GBS type III-specific) activity (none to 1280(-1], and quantity of organisms (10(4) to 10(6] on the killing of several strains of GBS type III. Low doses of IVIG enhanced suckling rat survival (p less than 0.0025) and bacterial clearance (p less than 0.01). High doses of IVIG did not improve survival and in fact delayed bacterial clearance (p less than 0.05) when compared with low doses. Survival and bacterial clearance increased as the GBS type III activity of the IVIG lot increased. GBS opsonophagocytosis was suppressed at all penicillin concentrations (p less than 0.01) by high levels of IVIG (20 mg/ml). High-dose IVIG suppression of GBS opsonophagocytosis decreased as type III activity of the lot increased. We speculate that high doses of nonspecific IVIG may cause blockade of neutrophil or bacterial receptors necessary for GBS immunity in neonates.\r"

The S beta 2-MG value showed a significantly closer correlation to 1/CLdig (r = 0.84, p less than 0.0001) than to the other values. The regression equation was (1/CLdig) = 0.15 X (s beta 2-MG) + 0.08. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values correlated less closely with 1/CLdig (r = 0.67 and 0.71, respectively). Age and weight had no significant linear correlation with CLdig and 1/CLdig. Determination of s beta 2-MG values allowed an estimate of CLdig by means of the regression equation between s beta 2-MG and 1/CLdig, and permitted a prediction of the required maintenance dose of digoxin. We conclude that s beta 2-MG is a good indicator of CLdig in neonates, and that the determination of s beta 2-MG values may facilitate the advance individualization of digoxin therapy in the neonatal period.\r"

All 271 patients were included in the safety evaluation, and 225 (111 receiving butoconazole and 114 receiving miconazole) were included in the efficacy evaluation. Eight to ten days after treatment completion, 88% of the butoconazole-treated patients and 91% of the miconazole-treated patients were Candida negative; 80% of the butoconazole-treated patients and 82% of the miconazole-treated patients were considered clinically cured. Thirty days after treatment completion, 73% of the butoconazole-treated patients and 69% of the miconazole-treated patients remained Candida negative; 78% of the butoconazole-treated patients and 80% of the miconazole-treated patients remained free of clinical symptoms of vulvovaginitis. None of the differences between the two treatment groups was statistically significant. Six patients (four receiving butoconazole and two receiving miconazole) reported increased symptoms of vulvovaginal irritation, and three of them (two receiving butoconazole and one receiving miconazole) withdrew from the trial. Thus, the efficacy and safety of the three-day butoconazole treatment regimen were equivalent to those of the seven-day miconazole treatment regimen. The advantage of the shorter butoconazole treatment is increased patient compliance with maintenance of high efficacy.\r"

These conditions are responsible for 5% of all hospital discharges, 10% of all hospital procedures, and 9% of all physician visits. They are also responsible for over 2 million persons being unable to do major activities, for 5 million being limited in other ways, and for at least 1 million being severely limited in the ability to perform activities of daily living. As great these impacts would appear to be, they are likely to grow since the aging of the population increases both the prevalence and severity of impact of the rheumatic diseases.\r"

Our study examines the distribution of cells bearing these \"rheumatic\" antigens in 23 subjects with rheumatic fever/RHD of Maori, Polynesian and Caucasian ancestry and 182 members of their families (rheumatic fever/RHD families) as well as in 46 members of families in which no member had been demonstrated to have had rheumatic fever/RHD (control families). Mononuclear cells from the blood of all cooperating family members were prepared and non-T cells isolated by sheep red blood cell rosette depletion. The binding of monoclonal antibodies 83S19.23 and D8103 to non-T cells was measured using an immunoperoxidase technique. Subjects with rheumatic fever/RHD had a significantly higher proportion of cells binding the antibodies than the unaffected members of all families. Unaffected members of rheumatic fever/RHD families had significantly higher levels of such rheumatic cells than control families. An increase in the proportion of rheumatic cells with age was noted in unaffected members of rheumatic fever/RHD families but not in rheumatic fever/RHD subjects of control families. A level of 13% 83S19.23 positive non-T cells optimally discriminated between rheumatic and nonrheumatic individuals. The relative risk for rheumatic fever/RHD with 13% or greater positive cells was 9.48. The negative predictive value of having less than 13% positive cells was 98.3%. In the population studied, 83S19.23 seems especially capable of identifying those with low risk for rheumatic fever/RHD.\r"

We have found that a subset of patients with JRA demonstrate a marked expansion of B cells without an alteration in B cell subset distribution. However, there was actually decreased in vitro immunoglobulin production in response to stimulation with either pokeweed mitogen or hydrocortisone. These B cell abnormalities were found to correlate with a marked increase in the percentage of CD4 + CD45R + T cells, a T cell subset thought to be responsible for inducing suppression. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of CD4 + CD29 + T cells, a T cell subset thought to be responsible for inducing B cell immunoglobulin production. Our results suggest that the B cell abnormalities seen in JRA may be related to defects in T cell immunoregulation.\r"

Western blot analysis using sera from 82 patients with JRA revealed that 63% of ANA positive JRA sera reacted with 2 bands (50-40 kDa) in the 0.3 M extract whereas only 14% of ANA negative JRA sera had antibody to these bands. Antibody to the 50-40 kDa antigen(s) strongly correlated with the presence of ANA by immunofluorescence and was found in 70% of patients with iritis; however, it did not correlate with disease subgroup or disease activity.\r"

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we determined the effects of these supplements on rectal polyps in these patients. Analysis by intent to treat suggested that the high-fiber supplement had a limited effect. Analysis adjusted for patient compliance showed a stronger benefit from the high-fiber supplement during the middle 2 years of the trial. The results provide evidence for inhibition of benign large bowel neoplasia by grain fiber supplements in excess of 11 g/day in this study population. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dietary grain fiber and total dietary fat act as competing variables in the genesis of large bowel neoplasia.\r"

Upper airway injury is reliably diagnosed endoscopically, but early diagnosis of pulmonary parenchymal injury is less reliable. Radiographic diagnosis in such cases is inconsistent. This study correlated degree of chest X-ray (CXR) change with pulmonary function in 29 adult patients during the first 5 days after inhalation injury. Daily CXRs were graded: 0 (normal), 1+ (peribronchial cuffing or perivascular edema), 2+ (edema involving one third of the lung field), 3+ (edema involving two thirds of the lung field), and 4+ (edema involving the entire lung field). Extravascular lung water volume (EVLW) was measured in vivo with the thermal/green dye double indicator technique. Twenty-five of the 29 patients were intubated on admission. Of these patients with serious inhalation injury, 84% showed some abnormality on CXR within 48 hours after injury. When abnormalities were present on CXR, pulmonary dysfunction (increases EVLW, increases Qs/Qt, decreases compliance) was clinically important. These data suggest that this grading scale may have utility in reports of CXR findings in inhalation injury.\r"

  ".W": "Severe lower extremity trauma frequently results in a soft-tissue deficit that mandates wound coverage using some form of vascularized flap. The recent rediscovery of inclusion of the deep fascia during elevation of random skin flaps has enhanced the viability of large local flaps as a reconstructive option in the lower leg. In selected cases of relatively uncontaminated, moderate-sized defects, the choice of this maneuver has permitted closure of many defects which previously might have required a complex microsurgical tissue transfer. This series of 41 random-based local fasciocutaneous flaps in the lower leg in 38 patients has in all cases except two been successful in achieving preferred wound healing. Flap necrosis occurred only in these two cases presumably due to peripheral vascular insufficiency necessitating limb amputation in one patient. Eight (19%) had some form of complication, most occurring in the subset of flaps used for distal third lower leg wounds. The fasciocutaneous flap is conceptually simple, rapidly elevated and inset, and minimizes the region of surgical insult for many multitrauma patients who otherwise might have to forego any attempt for limb salvage.\r"

Recent reports have suggested that adrenergic mechanisms may play an important modulatory role in arachidonate metabolism during early sepsis, specifically in the synthesis of the vasoactive metabolites thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin. The purpose of the present set of experiments was to evaluate the extent to which adrenergic mechanisms contribute to early alterations in regional perfusion during Gram-negative bacteremia, using the mixed alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a 3-hour continuous intraarterial infusion of either saline (n = 7) or 6.6 +/- 0.4 x 10(8) live E. coli colony forming units (n = 7), after which regional perfusion was determined using 51Cr-labelled microspheres (16.5 +/- 0.1 micron). Significant reductions (p less than 0.05) in blood flows to the renal, gastric, cecal, pancreatic, and splenic beds, as well as a reduction (p less than 0.05) in the calculated portal venous flow, were observed in the bacteremic group while mean arterial blood pressure remained unchanged. Further experiments conducted in 14 rats with preexisting alpha adrenergic receptor blockade revealed relative preservation of renal, gastric, cecal, and portal venous blood flows during bacteremia. These data identify alterations in regional perfusion during early E. coli bacteremia occurring before changes in systemic arterial blood pressure, and indicate that adrenergic mechanisms participate in the modulation of such.\r"

Patients suffered at least 20% total body surface area burns (BSA); the mean BSA injury was 36.7% BSA, with a range of 20 to 74% BSA. All patients were admitted to our Burn Center within at least 12 hours of injury. Laboratory studies included frequent determinations of serum chemistries including osmolalities, and continuous 24-hour urine collections for electrolytes and osmolality determinations. Fluid requirements (cc/kg/% BSA), urine output (cc/kg/hr), sodium intake and excretion (mEq/kg/% BSA), serum and urine osmolality (mOsm/kg), serum creatinine (mg/dl), body weight (kg), and enteral intake (cc/24 hrs and calories/24 hrs) were analyzed for comparison at 24-hour intervals following burn injury. Using Student's t-test, significance was attributed to a p less than 0.05. Nonparametric methods were used to compare non-normalized data. Regression analysis was used to compare sodium intake (mEq/kg) and fluid intake (cc/kg) between the HSL and the LR groups in relation to % BSA. Our data show no advantage of HSL over conventional therapy with LR for burn resuscitation. We were not able to demonstrate decreased fluid requirements, improved tolerance of feedings, or decrease in per cent weight gain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We measured transverse mediastinal width and mediastinal-width to chest-width (M/C) ratio on supine films of 100 nontraumatized controls. In 95% the transverse mediastinal width was less than 7.5 cm and the M/C ratio was less than 0.38. Thus a transverse width of 7.5 cm or more or an M/C ratio of 0.38 or more can be defined as abnormal with 95% confidence. Application of these values to determine abnormality in 32 patients with proven aortic or brachiocephalic injury showed that the transverse mediastinal width was within normal limits in 41% and M/C ratio was normal in 69%. Utilizing smaller values that would identify all abnormals resulted in false positive rates in the controls of 74% and 87%, respectively. However, one or more of eight specific signs of mediastinal abnormality related to hemorrhage or pseudoaneurysm formation were present in 94% of abnormals compared to only 11% of controls. Because of extreme overlap of transverse mediastinal width and M/C ratio between normals and abnormals, precise measurement of the mediastinum cannot reliably separate the two groups. The subjective assessment of anatomic mediastinal abnormality remains a superior plain film method in determining the need for aortography.\r"

Other toxins have been studied in animals or in vitro to assess their suitability as candidates for detoxification by specific antibodies. Testing conditions are often empirical suggesting that numerous improvements need to be introduced in ITT. Basic mechanisms in ITT include three phases: sequestration, extraction and elimination. The pharmacokinetics of these three phases depend on the type of antidotal binding site (ABS). IgG or its Fab2, Fab or Fv fragment are the possible choices. The Fab fragment is the most frequently used ABS because of its diffusion properties in the peripheral compartments and its renal excretion by glomerular filtration. Toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic considerations indicate that the dosage cannot be satisfactorily calculated from stoichiometric principles. Study of the toxin dose-lethality curves shows that ABS dosage can be lowered. Moreover, clinical data reveal that some FAb fragments are directly eliminated without acting on toxin molecules. In order to counteract these drawbacks, a compromise between dosage and duration of infusion is suggested. Other improvements will stem from advances in immunologic methodology. Monoclonal and chimeric antibodies are new tools that will help resolve the clinical problems of immunogenicity and adverse reactions associated with polyclonal ABS.\r"

The over-all 1 and 2-year patient survival rates were 97 and 94 per cent, respectively. The over-all 1 and 2-year graft survival rates were 69 and 63 per cent, respectively. Graft success was not influenced by patient age greater than 50 years, diabetes, initial graft removal, interval between initial graft removal and retransplantation, duration of initial graft function, level of presensitization or HLA-Dr antigen matching. Currently, cadaver renal retransplantation can be performed safely and with an improved opportunity for graft success. Patients who return to dialysis after losing an allograft should be encouraged to consider another transplant for the same reasons that prompted initial transplantation.\r"

The 64 infants, children and young adults ranged from 2 days to 28 years old (median age 2 years), and 28 were less than 1 year old. Intubation was used in only 4 patients: 2 who also underwent ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux, 1 with stones in the renal pelvis and 1 with pyonephrosis. We successfully repaired 60 of 64 nonintubated renal units (93.4 per cent). Temporary postoperative ureteral stenting was required for extravasation from 8 renal units (12.5 per cent). Two patients later underwent repeat ureteropyeloplasty for recurrent obstruction. Nephrectomy was performed for pyonephrosis in 1 patient and for a nonfunctioning kidney that had exhibited poor function preoperatively in 1. Prolonged ileus necessitated extended hospitalization in 3 patients (4.6 per cent). We conclude that nonintubated dismembered ureteropyeloplasty for uncomplicated, primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction can be performed safely and successfully, and should be considered the standard treatment. Positioning of the Penrose drain is critical to avoid urinoma formation. When persistent urinary leakage occurs temporary diversion is easy and well tolerated. Hospital stay averaged 12.1 days for patients with extravasation compared to 4.3 days when no extravasation occurred. Immediate preoperative retrograde pyelography did not seem to contribute to postoperative urinary extravasation by causing edema of the ureteral orifice.\r"

Furthermore, due to elevation of the bladder base without simultaneous elevation of the bladder neck and urethra, de novo stress urinary incontinence may occur. We developed a transvaginal needle suspension operation for the bladder and urethra that repairs anterior vaginal wall prolapse with excellent support of the bladder base and repositions the bladder neck in the high retropubic position, all during a simple and rapid operation that is tolerated well by the patient.\r"

Of 31 vasovasostomy patients 12 (38 per cent) had significant sperm-surface antibodies (20 per cent binding or more) by the direct immunobead antisperm antibody test. Preoperative serum assays correctly classified the antibody status of 69 per cent of the vasectomy patients. The immunological impact of spermatic granuloma formation, duration of vasal obstruction, patient age and presence of sperm in the vasal fluid at operation also were assessed. An inverse relationship between the proportion of antibody-bound sperm and the percentage of motile sperm in the ejaculate of vas reversal patients was found with videomicrographic semen analysis. The percentage motility was significantly lower among patients with greater quantities of sperm-surface antibodies. No other parameter of semen analysis showed this difference when compared for positive or negative immunobead antisperm antibody test results.\r"

Several factors are enabling the medical community to begin intervention prior to a patient's diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. These factors include an understanding of the biologic markers of disease progression; advances in antiviral therapeutics; and an improved ability to control the most common presenting opportunistic infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Providing adequate ambulatory care for large numbers of asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals and coordinating inner-city health care facilities will become critical. Important questions regarding service provision need to be adequately addressed. The cost of yearly treatment, estimated to be $5 billion per year, will require a major financial commitment at all levels of government and the private sector. Effective early intervention in human immunodeficiency virus disease may alter the course of one of the most devastating epidemics in modern history. Planning for its implementation should begin immediately.\r"

In this context, music, a powerful medium in the lives of adolescents, offers conflicting values. The explicit sexual and violent lyrics of some forms of music often clash with the themes of abstinence and rational behavior promoted by adult society. Identification with rock music, particularly those styles that are rejected by adults, functions to separate adolescents from adult society. Some forms of rock music extend well beyond respectability in fulfilling this definitional role. Total immersion into a rock subculture, such as heavy metal, may be both a portrait of adolescent alienation and an unflattering reflection of an adolescent's perception of the moral and ethical duplicity of adult society. Physicians should be aware of the role of music in the lives of adolescents and use music preferences as clues to the emotional and mental health of adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "Several radiological studies have suggested that pyelonephritis in infancy and childhood may result in kidney growth retardation without renal scarring. In the present study, we induced ascending pyelonephritis in 20-day-old rats with intravesical infusion of E. coli. Four days after infusion, E. coli was cultured from all renal cortex. The rats were either left untreated (PNu) or were treated with trimethoprim-sulfa (PNt). The rats were investigated one month after infection and compared with an age-matched control group (C). Seventy-nine percent of the PNu rats had recovered spontaneously from infection. Body weight was the same in all groups. In PNu rats, kidney weight (KW), kidney area (KA) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly decreased. KW, KA and GFR were similar in PNt and C rats. The numbers of filtering nephrons were not reduced by the infection. The total cortical DNA content (index of cell number) was significantly lower in PNu (5.30 +/- 0.32 mg) and PNt (6.62 +/- 0.44 mg) than in C rats (8.48 +/- 0.49 mg). The cortical DNA content was significantly lower in PNu than in PNt rats. The cortical protein/DNA ratio was significantly higher in PNu rats than in C rats. The protein/DNA ratio was similar in PNt and PNu rats. The increase in protein/DNA ratio was interpreted as a sign of cell hypertrophy. The inflammatory process as such did not increase the protein/DNA ratio. The kidneys were also examined for structural lesions. Signs of scarring, inflammation and cell necrosis were almost absent in all groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diffusion transfer rates of the low molecular weight solutes increased dramatically with shaking, with near maximal values obtained at a shaking rate of 250 RPM. The permeability area product (PA) for each of the low molecular weight solutes increased about fourfold with rapid shaking while the PA of protein increased by only about 50%. It seems likely while the PA of protein increased by only about 50%. It seems likely that shaking increased PA primarily via reduction of the thickness of stagnant peritoneal fluid layers, although increases in surface area or changes in tissue permeability cannot be excluded with certainty. We conclude that stagnant fluid layers probably are the rate limiting step in diffusive peritoneal transfer of low molecular weight solutes in stationary rats.\r"

  ".W": "Variability in the collagen chain composition of renal basement membranes was demonstrated by immunofluorescent microscopy using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and correlating with imaging of the glomerular basement membrane by phase microscopy. Antibodies toward the globular domains of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen chains, triple helical and 7S domains of collagen IV bind within the glomerulus to mesangial matrix, along the subendothelial region of the glomerular capillary wall, and to all tubular and vascular basement membranes. The portion of glomerular basement membrane corresponding to the phase dense image is not reactive with these antibodies. A different binding pattern is seen with antibodies against two novel globular regions of basement membrane collagen chains which bind to the phase dense aspect of glomerular basement membrane and to Bowman's capsule. Human tubular basement membrane is not reactive, except along portions of the distal tubule, whereas bovine tubular basement membrane is diffusely reactive; mesangial matrix and extraglomerular vascular basement membranes are not reactive. Although a possible explanation for the regional distribution of basement membrane collagen antigens in the glomerulus may relate to antigen exposure, a more likely reason is that collagen chains are regionally expressed. The staining patterns suggest that the novel collagen chains have a selective tissue distribution compared with alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains and that the glomerular cells of origin of these collagen IV chains may differ.\r"

Indirect immunofluorescent staining revealed that intraglomerular localization of type III collagen antigen in 41 of 66 patients, while it was absent from the glomeruli of normal human kidneys. Type III collagen was found within the mesangium of 22 patients with various types of renal diseases, and was distributed in a focal and segmental manner in most of the cases. Mesangial localization of the collagen correlated with the increase in the mesangial matrix. Type III collagen was also present in the vascular pole, crescents (particularly in the organizing phase) and sclerosed glomeruli. Immunoelectron microscopy using pre-embedding and post-embedding techniques confirmed the above observations. These findings indicate that type III collagen participates in mesangial expansion, crescent organization, and glomerulosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Within two years we have had the opportunity of observing seven leukemic children who were referred to our Pediatric Nephrology Unit for delayed renal failure following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). These children (3 to 12 years old), six with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and one with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), underwent BMT (4 autologous BMT, 3 allogeneic BMT) after the first remission in two, and after the second remission in five. Preparative regimen for BMT included cyclosphosphamide in three, cyclosphosphamide, vepeside and cytosine A in four, and a total body irradiation in a single dose of 10 grays (1000 R) in all of them. Three children were treated immediately after grafting with low dose cyclosporine for four to six months. Five to 10 months after BMT, four patients developed a hemolytic uremic syndrome with severe hypertension. The remaining three were found to have isolated renal insufficiency several months post-BMT. In the seven patients, renal biopsy showed a uniform pattern of severe glomerular involvement characterized by extensive lesions of mesangiolysis associated with severe arteriolonecrosis. A repeat biopsy performed one year later, in two patients showed severe scarring of the renal parenchyma with minor lesions of mesangiolysis. The similarity of the pathologic features observed suggests that the same mechanism might have been operative in the seven patients. It is very likely that the nephropathy is related to total body irradiation enhanced by chemotherapy. We conclude that current treatments of high risk leukemia might become a new cause of chronic renal failure. Further investigations are needed to know the exact incidence of this complication.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of 14 patients (ages 6 months to 33 years) with glycogen storage disease, Type I (GSD-I) was carried out in order to define the character and frequency of renal dysfunction. A marked increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was documented in virtually all subjects, with the mean GFR raised by approximately 50%, to the range of 170 ml/min/1.73 m2. While this constituted the only renal abnormality found in the younger patients, a significant increase in urinary albumin excretion was seen in three teen-aged individuals; three patients over 20 years of age exhibited frank proteinuria (2 to 8 g/day). Renal biopsy on two of the proteinuric subjects revealed focal and global glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Evaluation of factors known to cause an increase in GFR did not define the precise etiology for its elevation in GSD-I. These studies suggest that: (1) glomerular damage and chronic renal disease are common in older patients with GSD-I; (2) the renal injury appears to be specifically related to GSD-I and is not secondary to the treatment of the disease; and (3) the natural history of the renal lesion in GSD-I may be analogous to that seen in insulin-dependent diabetes, with a \"silent\" period where hyperfiltration is the only demonstrable renal abnormality, followed by evidence of increasing glomerular damage progressing from microalbuminuria to frank proteinuria.\r"

In this study in vitro methods were developed to grow and propagate large numbers of cyst-derived epithelial cells from ADPKD kidneys and cortical epithelial cells from normal human kidneys (NK). In order to study their biologic features during early cell passages, cells were grown on Vitrogen (bovine dermal collagen)-FCS (fetal calf serum) coated dishes and fed a basic medium (DME:F12) supplemented with 10% FCS or a defined medium (Sens) containing insulin, transferrin, selenium, hydrocortisone, tri-iodothyronine and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Both ADPKD and NK cells grew as monolayers, were positive for keratin by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry and had ultrastructural features of renal epithelial cells. Confluent NK and ADPKD monolayers formed domes. In contrast to NK cells, the growth and propagation of ADPKD cells were not supported by defined medium alone but required serum supplementation and ADPKD cells did not respond to growth factors (insulin, transferrin, EGF) that promoted the growth of NK cells. In serum supplemented media, the growth rate, cell doubling time and end cell number of ADPKD and NK cells were the same. Moreover, ADPKD cells did not exhibit any in vitro features of transformed cells: they were not immortal, they were sensitive to contact inhibition, they were anchorage dependent and they were not tumorigenic in nude mice. These findings do not support an increased rate of cell growth or cell transformation as causative factors in ADPKD.\r"

Bronchial carcinoids are characteristically found to be central tumors often occurring in comparatively young patients; surgical resection with minimal but clear margins is usually curative. The long-term prognosis is excellent in the majority of patients, although rarely regional nodal and distant metastases develop. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are most frequently peripheral tumors. In stage I and II disease, surgical resection alone is curative and patients with locally advanced tumors may have a prolonged disease-free interval. The overall prognosis is less favorable than that of bronchial carcinoids but considerably better than that of small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, with which they are still at times confused. Intermediate-sized cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are often wrongly categorized as large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. They have a distinctly aggressive clinical course comparable with that of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and should be treated similarly. Small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are aggressive, rapidly disseminating neoplasms. Even in clinical stage I tumors, patients must be considered to have disseminated metastases. The role of surgical therapy in these two latter tumor types is adjuvant to aggressive systemic chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients underwent single left lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis between June and November 1987. Preoperatively all were housebound, receiving continuous, supplemental oxygen, and their pulmonary function had deteriorated despite corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Pulmonary preservation was by means of pulmonary arterial perfusion with modified Euro-Collins solution, 60 ml/kg, at 4 degrees C with adjunctive iloprost (synthetic prostacyclin) infusion. The heart from each donor was used successfully for transplantation. Good early graft function enabled extubation 11, 46, and 96 hours after transplantation. An omental wrap was used around the bronchial anastomosis, and bronchial healing was satisfactory in all. All patients had episodes of pulmonary rejection diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, chest x-ray infiltrates, the exclusion of pneumonitis by bronchoalveolar lavage, and prompt response to \"pulse\" steroid therapy. Two of the three patients had three episodes of opportunistic pulmonary infections: Herpes simplex pneumonitis, Pneumocystis carinii infection, and Aspergillus pneumonitis. The three patients were discharged from the hospital after 5, 6, and 7 1/2 weeks, respectively. The first and third patients remain alive and well, living essentially normal lives 24 and 19 months after transplantation with no evidence of arterial desaturation on exercise testing while breathing room air. The second patient had symptoms of deteriorating lung function with a progressive decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, vital capacity, and diffusion capacity despite repeated \"pulse\" therapy with combinations of methylprednisolone, antithymocyte globulin, and OKT3 (Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc., Raritan, N.J.). An open lung biopsy specimen showed obliterative bronchiolitis, and this patient underwent orthotopic lung retransplantation, on the right side. Despite excellent early graft function and early extubation, he died of uncontrolled rejection and general debility after 3 weeks. This early experience in our center with two of three patients surviving 19 to 24 months, respectively, confirms the restoration of good pulmonary function and near normal life-style in patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis after single lung transplantation, as first reported by the Toronto Lung Transplant Group. We have used an alternative method of lung preservation (cold crystalloid pulmonary perfusion as opposed to topical cooling, used by the Toronto group), which provided excellent pulmonary preservation up to and beyond 4 hours' storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To avoid a fatal outcome in these situations, we postponed sternal closure in nine critically ill neonates by suturing silicone elastomer sheeting to the skin edges. This maneuver, in a setting of optimal inotropic and ventilatory support, allowed eight of the nine neonates to survive. The mean age at operation was 10.2 days (range 3 to 31). The mean preoperative weight was 3004.4 gm (range 1550 to 3780). The sternal wound was protected with an impervious silicone elastomer sheeting for a mean of 5.6 days (range 2 to 12). There was no instance of wound infection. The judicious application of this technique after operations for complex congenital heart disease can provide the necessary compliance vital for immediate cardiopulmonary performance and ultimate survival.\r"

We studied a less demanding nonloading exercise program for the back extensor muscles in postmenopausal women who were not on estrogen therapy. We randomly assigned 65 healthy Caucasian women without evidence of or risk factors for osteoporosis into an exercise group and a control group. The strength of the back extensor muscles and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years. In addition, a physical activity score was determined. Compliance was assessed by regular interviews and review of diaries. During the 2-year study, the mean rates of bone loss in the two groups were not statistically different. The strength of the back extensor muscles increased in both groups but significantly more (P = 0.002) in the exercise group. We conclude that postmenopausal bone loss is unaffected by a modest exercise program despite an increase in muscle strength. Nonloading muscle exercise may be ineffective in retarding vertebral bone loss in ambulatory, healthy postmenopausal women.\r"

Although currently no role exists for the clinical laboratory in the early diagnosis of malignant melanoma, serial quantitative analyses of total or individual melanogens or of catecholamine metabolites in urine or plasma specimens may be of value in the management of patients with this disorder.

Among all cancers, its rate of increase is exceeded only by that of bronchogenic carcinoma. Before administration of systemic therapy, histologic confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of both the relative medical fitness of the patient and the available psychosocial support are important. Chemotherapeutic and interferon-alpha regimens may offer transient reprieve in 15 to 20% of patients but yield few long-term survivors. Other biologic response modifiers, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 2, are promising but without established consistent efficacy. Postoperative systemic treatment programs for patients at risk for disseminated disease are of no proven benefit in randomized trials and cannot be endorsed outside of the context of a clinical trial. Radiation therapy may provide useful palliation, especially with a fraction of 400 cGy rather than the more traditional dose of 200 cGy/fraction. Selected patients with metastatic disease may benefit from surgical resection, but residual disease after attempted extirpation is usually associated with prolonged disability.\r"

Discoid lesions are commonly seen, but they are not specific for chronic cutaneous LE. These scarring and disfiguring changes are also present in neonatal LE, SLE, and complement deficiency LE. Because definitive diagnosis cannot be made by cutaneous examination alone, all patients should initially be evaluated for systemic disease. A small percentage of patients with chronic cutaneous LE will ultimately develop SLE, and therefore, patients should be re-evaluated periodically. The pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions is not definitively known. There is suggestive evidence implicating T-cell mediated injury, especially in discoid LE. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity may also play a significant role in cellular damage in subacute cutaneous LE and neonatal LE, especially in the presence of anti-Ro antibody. Immunoglobulin deposition in association with membrane attack complex, has been associated with epidermal injury in some cases. Treatment of chronic cutaneous LE is largely symptomatic and nonspecific, focusing on reduction of inflammation. Further knowledge of pathogenesis will, hopefully, provide for specific immunologic therapy.\r"

  ".U": "89363653\r", 
  ".W": "Based upon the rather large worldwide experience that has been published recently, it would appear that the concept of subacute cutaneous LE as presented in our original reports starting 10 years ago is still a viable one. However, we must now also consider the possibility that these patients will occasionally develop other types of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome and, on occasion, have their skin disease triggered by drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide. However, the majority of these patients will have recurrent skin disease activity and musculoskeletal symptoms as the major manifestations of their illness. Although most of these patients do have a relatively mild disease course, a small percentage seem to be at risk for developing potentially life-threatening complications of systemic LE. The future challenge in this area lies in identifying prognostic features that may correlate with this more aggressive disease course so that this subgroup of patients can be more efficiently managed. Our preliminary studies have suggested several candidates for further study: the papulosquamous/psoriasiform subacute cutaneous LE lesional subtype; development of acute cutaneous LE; resistance to antimalarials alone; leukopenia; high titer ANA; and the presence of circulating double-stranded DNA antibodies. Another possibility may include the rate of systemic disease onset. Discoid LE patients who have not developed clinically significant SLE manifestations within the first 2 years of the appearance of their skin lesions have a very low risk for suffering from severe SLE complications later in their disease course. The same question might be asked of subacute cutaneous LE. In addition, some subacute cutaneous LE patients have a single episode of disease activity followed by long-term, if not permanent, remission. More needs to be learned about this more benign pattern of illness in the hope of identifying favorable prognostic signs. Our impressions regarding subacute cutaneous LE disease outcome have mostly come from retrospective or point-prevalence types of clinical analyses; more prospective examinations of large groups of patients will be required to better address the issue of prognosis in subacute cutaneous LE. The data published to date suggest that this is a relatively homogeneous group of patients immunogenetically: they frequently have circulating anti-Ro auto-antibodies and often possess the HLA-DR3 phenotype. Much circumstantial evidence indicates that this particular genetically determined autoimmune response might be directly participating in pathogenesis of this form of LE-specific skin injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The typical clinical presentation is that of multiple indurated nodules or plaques (or both), often associated with lipoatrophy, there being a predilection for the proximal extremities and trunk. Because the clinical and histologic findings of LE panniculitis overlap with those of other connective tissue diseases, evaluation of patients suspected of having LE panniculitis should include a complete history and physical examination as well as serologic studies, determination of peripheral blood counts, and tests of renal function. A deep excisional biopsy rather than punch biopsy should be performed for diagnosis. The characteristic histologic pattern includes hyaline necrosis of fat; lymphoid nodules, often with germinal centers; and lymphocytic lobular panniculitis. Direct immunofluorescence testing of skin may help confirm the diagnosis in patients who have less than classic histologic features. LE panniculitis tends to have a chronic course marked by recurrent nodules or plaques (or both). Antimalarial agents, with or without courses of systemic steroids, are beneficial in most patients.\r"

Although never fatal, localized scleroderma may cause considerable disability from joint contractures and subcutaneous atrophy. Facial lesions are particularly disfiguring and may be accompanied by hemiatrophy. Serum auto-antibodies are common but do not imply systemic disease. The presence of ANAs or antibodies to ssDNA correlates directly with more extensive and prolonged disease. Blood eosinophilia may be striking, and its presence correlates with active disease. Patients with elevated serum IgG appear to be at a greater risk for the subsequent development of contractures. These laboratory abnormalities are useful in determining prognosis and during follow-up. No accepted and effective treatment exists. Physical therapy should be instituted immediately in all patients at risk for contractures. Systemic corticosteroids, used early in patients with active and widespread involvement, can be expected to improve the inflammatory phase. A variety of systemic agents have been reported to be helpful, but no controlled studies exist on their effectiveness.\r"

It is still unclear whether EF represents a variant of scleroderma; however, it is becoming increasingly recognized that scleroderma shares many features in common with EF including eosinophilia, hypergammaglobulinemia, positive ANA and rheumatoid factor, and an association with hematologic disease. The rarity of Raynaud's phenomenon and significant visceral changes help distinguish EF from systemic scleroderma. In this regard, however, EF more closely resembles the localized scleroderma syndromes, especially morphea profunda and pansclerotic morphea. Biopsy in EF, systemic scleroderma, and localized scleroderma will show comparable changes, the essential difference being the levels at which they occur.\r"

Treatment of associated malignancy may or may not have an effect on myositic or cutaneous disease. 5. Dermatomyositis and associated malignancy may share a common pathogenesis resulting from abnormal immune function. 6. Search for malignancy should be carried out on the basis of abnormal findings on history and physical examination or screening laboratory.\r"

Cutaneous immunofluorescence is widely available and has an established place in the field of dermatopathology. As with other microscopic interpretations, substantial experience, along with an understanding of basic immunopathologic principles, is necessary for reliable results.

A median increase of 80% in the area under the zidovudine plasma concentration/time curve occurred with the addition of probenecid. Quinine sulphate prevented the probenecid effect but had no effect on zidovudine kinetics when taken without probenecid by four other subjects. All of the effects were secondary to changes in zidovudine metabolism, since neither probenecid nor quinine changed the renal elimination of zidovudine. Probenecid could be used in combination with zidovudine to extend the interval between doses and reduce the daily requirement for zidovudine, thus enhancing convenience and reducing costs.\r"

Pain and radiological joint space were monitored during the period up to arthroplasty and the condition of the excised femoral head was determined. As judged by radiological and histopathological data, the two treatment groups were at a similar pathophysiological end-point when they came to arthroplasty. In the indomethacin group the affected hips lost joint space more rapidly than did the contralateral hips, a difference not seen in the azapropazone group. The patients receiving azapropazone, who had higher concentrations of synovial vasodilator prostaglandins, took longer than the indomethacin group to reach the arthroplasty end-point. Potent inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis may be inappropriate in the management of osteoarthritis of the hip.\r"

The trial subjects were attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), and randomisation was by TBA and not by mother. 68 TBAs attended a course on third stage management and data collection; 19 had to be excluded from the trial. 23 TBAs in the early suckling group and 26 in the control group recorded blood loss in 2104 and 2123 deliveries of liveborn singletons, respectively. The frequency of PPH (loss greater than 500 ml) was 7.9% in the suckling group and 8.4% in the control group and the mean blood loss 258 ml and 256 ml, respectively. Neither of these results differed significantly between the groups. Analysis of the results by individual TBA showed no significant difference between the groups. The frequency of PPH in women of higher parity and in those with multiple pregnancies and stillbirths was high, as expected, which seems to validate the results. The frequency of retained placenta was too low to be analysed.\r"

The antimicrobial resistance pattern and plasmid profile of the Yucatan strain were similar to those of the 1969-72 pandemic strain. Antimicrobial resistances and plasmid profiles were different in sporadic Western hemisphere strains. This is the first outbreak of Sd1 among US tourists and it is the largest known outbreak in the Western hemisphere since the early 1970s. The dominant Sd1 strain is similar to that which caused the catastrophic 1969-72 pandemic. Surveillance and control measures have been instituted in the Yucatan peninsula.\r"

These circulating progenitors were harvested by leucapheresis and reinfused, together with autologous bone marrow cells, in seven patients with cancer after total body irradiation and melphalan. Complete haemopoietic recovery occurred in all seven transplanted patients in a very short time: mean (SD) 9.1 (0.9) days (range 8-11) to achieve more than 0.5 x 10(9)/l neutrophils, 9.9 (1.7) days (range 8-13) to over 1 x 10(9)/l neutrophils, 10.7 (2.6) days (range 9-16) to over 0.5 x 10(11)/l platelets, and 13.6 (4.2) days (range 13-21) to over 1.0 x 10(11)/l platelets. A reduction in the severity of mucositis was also observed. The rapid haematological recovery made possible by this approach promises to increase the therapeutic index of high-dose chemoradiotherapy regimens and to widen their role as treatment for chemoradiosensitive tumours.\r"

Biopsies of clinically active and clinically inactive mucosal patients were examined for parasites using routine hematoxylin and eosin histopathology and a new technique for rapid detection of Leishmania amastigotes using a genus-specific indirect immunofluorescent assay. No amastigotes were found in specimens from seven patients with clinically inactive mucosal disease using immunofluorescent monoclonal assay techniques, whereas specimens from seven out of 14 patients with clinically active mucosal disease were positive. These results suggest that the immunofluorescent antibody technique is markedly superior in identifying the intracellular amastigote in tissue sections of mucosal biopsies when compared to histopathology techniques or with other standard tests done in rural areas of Brazil. Various clinical and laboratory test data of the entire group of patients were examined and the efficacy of treatment evaluated. The median interval of time noted between cutaneous and mucosal disease was 4.5 years. Relapse was noted in 31% of patients treated with a low dose of meglumine antimoniate (10 mg per kg of body weight). Patients treated with a high dose of meglumine antimoniate (20 mg per kg of body weight) had a relapse rate of 27.3%. A chi-square statistical analysis revealed no significant difference (chi 2 = 0.049) between the two groups. Patients were considered cured if mucosal granulations were clinically absent after 4.6 years.\r"

Although much of the pathophysiology remains to be elucidated, some of the neurologic syndromes are probably due to direct HIV infection. The most common CNS syndrome, the subacute encephalopathy, appears to be caused by HIV infection. Other cerebral syndromes are caused by viral, fungal, and protozoan opportunistic infections. Current specific therapy is available for many of these infections. Aside from zidovudine, only experimental therapies are currently available for primary HIV infection. Less attention has been focused on the neuromuscular complications of HIV infection. They are probably more common than initially reported. Specific therapies for both inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies and myopathy related to HIV infection are reported. The pathophysiology of these disorders remains incompletely defined. As the population of HIV infected individuals continues to grow, the incidence of coincidental non-HIV neurologic disease will also rise. Attention must be directed to identifying coexistent remediable causes of neurologic dysfunction in this population.\r"

As can be seen, a pattern emerges. Disorders of sodium and osmolality, whether hypernatremia (hyperNa), hyponatremia (hypoNa), hyperosmolality (hyperOsm), or hypo-osmolality (hypoOsm), all produce CNS depression with encephalopathy as the major clinical manifestation. Disorders of potassium, whether hyperkalemia (hyperK) or hypokalemia (hypoK), produce PNS depression with muscle weakness as the major clinical manifestation. On the other hand, disorders of magnesium and calcemia produce both CNS and PNS manifestations. Hypercalcemia (hyperCa) and hypermagnesemia (hyperMg) produce CNS and PNS depression with encephalopathy and muscle weakness, respectively, being the major clinical manifestations. Hypocalcemia (hypoCa) and hypomagnesemia (hypoMg) produce CNS and PNS irritability with seizures and tetany, respectively, being the major clinical manifestations.\r"

  ".W": "The neurologic manifestations of gastrointestinal disease are generally thought to be uncommon, although an increasing number of previously unidentified associations are being established. These neurologic disorders may result from nutritional or non-nutritional causes. In the absence of clear malnutrition, it is likely that many of these disorders are underdiagnosed. As an example, Wernicke's encephalopathy is found at autopsy in as many as 2 per cent of brains, a very high percentage, given the rare recognition during life. The likely underdiagnosis of nutritional neurologic disorders is unfortunate because many are treatable and, more importantly, are preventable if malabsorption is suspected and appropriate supplementation initiated. For the neurologist, familiarity with the occasional association between neurologic abnormalities and specific gastrointestinal disorders is important, as is familiarity with the neurologic characteristics of disorders, such as Whipple's disease, that may present as isolated neurologic syndromes without gastrointestinal symptoms or signs. Renewed interest in selective deficiency states has resulted in identification of causative factors in several neurologic syndromes of previously presumed degenerative etiology. Recognition of the potential neurologic consequences of prolonged deficiency states also is important for the internist, because many of the syndromes are poorly reversible once symptomatic. The benefits of prevention invariably exceed those of treatment.\r"

Headache, mental status changes, papilledema, and numerous motor abnormalities including asterixis are commonly seen. Abnormalities in ventilation and gas exchange result in hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis, and these, in turn, interfere with cerebral metabolism, increase CBF, and may raise intracranial pressure. Chronic respiratory insufficiency can persist for many months with minimal neurologic symptoms, as numerous compensatory mechanisms, particularly renal, may take effect. Treatment includes restoring adequate ventilation and improving gas exchange and may require tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. Supplemental oxygen therapy should be carefully monitored, as high rates of flow may suppress the hypoxic drive for respiration and lead to significant carbon dioxide retention. The sleep apnea syndromes are a group of disorders in which abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Intermittent obstruction of the upper airway and abnormalities of brainstem respiratory centers cause frequent nocturnal awakenings and apneas in these patients. Treatments vary and include weight loss in obese subjects, respiratory stimulants, tracheostomy, and diaphragmatic pacing. Rapid ascent to high altitudes may result in headache, changes in mental status, papilledema, and other neurologic symptoms in certain individuals: a syndrome known as high-altitude sickness. Hypoxia leading to cerebral edema, nocturnal periodic breathing, and hypobaria produces neurologic symptoms in these individuals. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone may be effective in minimizing symptoms of this disorder. Sustained hyperventilation produces acral and circumoral paresthesias and lightheadedness in anxious individuals and can be maintained by relatively normal ventilatory patterns once established. These symptoms are due to hypophosphatemia and respiratory alkalosis, the latter reducing CBF and causing localized tissue hypoxia. Rebreathing into a paper bag at the first awareness of symptoms is the most effective form of treatment.\r"

Peripheral neuropathy, due to axonal involvement, is common and is characterized by ascending sensory and motor dysfunction. The treatment of renal failure also may lead to the development of neurologic abnormalities in the form of dialysis disequilibrium characterized by headache, nausea, irritability that may progress to seizures, coma, and death, which is caused by the entry of free water into the brain and swelling. Dialysis dementia, caused by the toxic effects of aluminum, is now rare. Renal transplant recipients may develop cerebrovascular disease, infections by opportunistic organisms, or malignant neoplasms, particularly primary lymphoma of the brain. As transplant recipients live longer and more operations are performed, additional complications may be seen in the future.\r"

The neurologic symptoms are due to a granulomatous process that mirrors that seen in the systemic form. Its diagnosis is usually established by the demonstration of sarcoidosis in other systems and supported by clinical, radiographic, and laboratory evidence. Any and all portions of the nervous system can be involved in either an acute or a chronic fashion. Early acute presentations tend to have excellent outcomes and the overall prognosis for the disease is good. The cranial nerves, especially the facial nerve, are most frequently involved and have a good prognosis. CNS involvement, usually in the form of a meningoencephalitis involving the hypothalamic region, is usually chronic and associated with poor prognosis. Peripheral nerve and muscle involvement is frequently asymptomatic. Although neuropathy or myopathy may present acutely, the usual presentation is subacute or chronic. There have been no controlled studies of therapy in neurosarcoidosis. Early implementation of corticosteroids remains the mainstay of treatment. Evidence for improvement with treatment is anecdotally reported in many cases, but progression of the disease also occurs despite therapy.\r"

The syndrome often includes a myopathy that is similar histologically to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The glycerol kinase (GK) locus is in the Xp21 region in the midportion of the short arm of the X chromosome and is in close proximity to the DMD locus. We have investigated GK activity and subcellular distribution of muscle GK in DMD patients and in a patient with the complex GKD syndrome presenting with myopathy. We found no abnormality of muscle GK specific activity or subcellular distribution in DMD. In the patient with the complex GKD syndrome the specific activity and kinetics of muscle GK were normal, but the subcellular distribution of muscle GK was altered. Liver GK had less than 10% of normal activity and showed markedly altered kinetics. These findings indicate that there is no abnormality of muscle GK activity in DMD muscle. Furthermore, the normal GK activity in an individual with the complex GKD syndrome suggests that muscle and liver GK are genetically distinct. These findings support the concept that the complex GKD syndrome results from small deletions that affect closely linked but separate loci for DMD, GK and adrenal hypoplasia.\r"

Regeneration chambers enhance rat sciatic nerve regeneration in vivo after transection by providing a structurally organized and protected preformed space within which nerve fibers are exposed to macromolecular compounds which direct and enhance nerve growth. ACTH and related peptides, independent of their corticotropic activities, increase the availability of structural proteins to the axon terminal in rats subjected to nerve crush injuries and demonstrate inotropic effects in adrenalectomized and/or hypophysectomized rats. Exogenously administered gangliosides promote neuronal sprouting, regeneration, and reinnervation in experimental situations and have undergone clinical testing in acute and chronic peripheral nerve disorders. At the current dosage levels and schedules, the clinical results of ganglioside therapy have been mixed. The success of the experimental studies supports further clinical testing of these therapies in peripheral nerve disorders.\r"

Rates ranged from 48 per 100,000 in the low-use area to 178 per 100,000 in the high-use area. Two variables accounted for most of the differences in the rates: the number of surgeons performing the procedure and the number of endarterectomies performed by surgeons with high practice volumes. Twice as many surgeons in the high-use area and 25 percent more in the average-use area performed carotid endarterectomy as compared with those in the low-use area. If the average number of cases per surgeon had been the same, the differences in the number of surgeons would have accounted for 36 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of the differences in use. Surgeons who performed 15 or more carotid endarterectomies during the year accounted for most of the variation in the rates. These high-volume surgeons represented 15 percent and 17 percent of the surgeons in the areas of high and average use, respectively, as compared with 4 percent of those in the low-use area. They accounted for 60 and 77 percent, respectively, of the additional endarterectomies. Three fourths of the surgeons performing carotid endarterectomies carried out fewer than 10, and 24 percent did only 1. We conclude that most of the geographic variation in the rate of carotid endarterectomy is caused by a few surgeons in high-use areas who perform large numbers of operations.\r"

  ".W": "Blood transfusions can influence the survival of organ allografts favorably, in spite of the danger of sensitization. We investigated the influence of HLA compatibility between blood donors and transfusion recipients on the production of HLA antibodies and on graft survival. Among recipients of transfusions who shared one HLA-DR antigen with their respective donors, antibodies developed in 6 of 28 who had received one transfusion, in 2 of 16 who had received three transfusions, and in 4 of 24 who had undergone renal transplantation. Among recipients who were mismatched with their donors for both HLA-DR antigens, the rate of sensitization was significantly higher in all three of these groups (18 of 30, P = 0.02; 12 of 16, P = 0.0007; and 12 of 22, P = 0.001). The survival of kidney allografts among graft recipients who were given transfusions and shared one HLA-DR antigen with their blood donors (81 percent at five years) was significantly higher than among recipients who were given transfusions and were mismatched for both HLA-DR antigens (57 percent; P = 0.02) or among recipients who were not given transfusions (45 percent; P = 0.001). There was no difference in graft survival between patients who received transfusions mismatched for two HLA-DR antigens and those who were not given transfusions. We conclude that allograft survival can be improved by pretransplantation blood transfusion when the transfusion recipients share at least one HLA-DR antigen with their donors. In view of the increased rate of sensitization and the lack of improvement in graft survival, the transfusion of blood mismatched for two HLA-DR antigens appears to be contraindicated in candidates for transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Over 13 million people in the United States wear soft contact lenses for refractive correction. Ulcerative keratitis is considered the most serious adverse effect of the use of contact lenses. We performed a case-control study with 86 cases patients, estimating separately for hospital-based (n = 61) and population-based (n = 410) controls the relative risk of ulcerative keratitis among users of extended-wear as compared with daily-wear soft contact lenses. The relative risk of ulcerative keratitis for extended-wear as compared with daily-wear lenses among the population-based controls was 3.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.35 to 6.48) and among the hospital-based controls, 4.21 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.95 to 9.08). Thirty-eight percent of those with extended-wear lenses used them only during the day, and 11 percent of those with daily-wear lenses occasionally wore them overnight. When lens wearers were distinguished according to their overnight use of lenses, the users of extended-wear lenses who wore them overnight had a risk 10 to 15 times as great as the users of daily-wear lenses who did not, and the users of daily-wear lenses who sometimes wore them overnight had 9 times the risk of the users of such lenses who did not. For the users of extended-wear lenses, the risk of ulcerative keratitis was incrementally related to the extent of overnight wear. A reduction in risk associated with more frequent attention to lens hygiene was almost significant. We conclude that soft contact lenses worn overnight carry a significantly greater risk for ulcerative keratitis than soft lenses worn only during the day.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence of secondary cancers after bone marrow transplantation, we reviewed the records of all patients at our center who received allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous transplants for leukemia (n = 1926) or aplastic anemia (n = 320). Thirty-five patients were given a diagnosis of secondary cancer between 1.5 months and 13.9 years (median, 1.0 year) after transplantation. Sixteen patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 6 had leukemias, and 13 had solid tumors (including 3 each with glioblastoma, melanoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma). There were 1.2 secondary cancers per 100 exposure-years during the first year after transplantation (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.0). The rate declined to 0.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.7) after one year. The age-adjusted incidence of secondary cancer was 6.69 times higher than that of primary cancer in the general population. In a multivariate model, the predictors (and relative risks) of any type of secondary cancer were acute graft-versus-host disease treated with either antithymocyte globulin (relative risk, 4.2) or an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (13.6) and total-body irradiation (3.9). Two additional factors were associated with secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: T-lymphocyte depletion of donor marrow (12.4) and HLA mismatch (3.8). We conclude that recipients of bone marrow transplantation have a low but significant risk of a secondary cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the records of 106 patients with cryptococcal infections and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treated at San Francisco General Hospital. We examined four issues: the efficacy of treatment with amphotericin plus flucytosine as compared with amphotericin alone, the efficacy of suppressive therapy, the prognostic clinical characteristics, and the course of nonmeningeal cryptococcosis. In 48 of the 106 patients (45 percent), cryptococcosis was the first manifestation of AIDS. Among the 89 patients with cryptococcal meningitis confirmed by culture, survival did not differ significantly between those treated with amphotericin plus flucytosine (n = 49) and those treated with amphotericin alone (n = 40). Flucytosine had to be discontinued in over half the patients because of cytopenia. Long-term suppressive therapy with either ketoconazole or amphotericin was associated with improved survival, as compared with survival in the absence of suppressive therapy (median survival, greater than or equal to 238 vs. 141 days; P less than 0.004). The only clinical features independently associated with a shorter cumulative survival were hyponatremia and a positive culture for cryptococcus from an extrameningeal source. The 14 patients with nonmeningeal cryptococcosis had a median survival (187 days) and rate of relapse (20 percent) similar to those in the patients with meningitis (165 days and 17 percent, respectively). From this retrospective study of cryptococcal infections in patients with AIDS we conclude that the addition of flucytosine to amphotericin neither enhances survival nor prevents relapse, but long-term suppressive therapy appears to benefit these patients.\r"

Disease activity was assessed on a clinical grading scale without knowledge of the treatment given. At the end of the treatment period, 22 of the 37 cyclosporine-treated patients (59 percent) had improvement, as compared with 11 of the 34 placebo-treated patients (32 percent) (P = 0.032). During cyclosporine treatment, there was significant improvement in plasma orosomucoid levels (P = 0.0025) and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (P = 0.00012). The effect of treatment became evident after two weeks. In the subsequent three months, during which the patients were gradually withdrawn from treatment, the improvement continued in 14 of the 37 patients (38 percent) in the cyclosporine group and in 5 of the 34 (15 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.034). No serious adverse events were observed.

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the metabolic side effects of antihypertensive drugs are responsible for their failure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with hypertension. Therefore, in 50 patients with essential hypertension, we performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of captopril (mean [+/- SD] dose, 81 +/- 24 mg per day) and hydrochlorothiazide (40 +/- 12 mg per day) over two four-month treatment periods. Captopril increased the insulin-mediated disposal of glucose, as compared with placebo, from 5.7 +/- 2.4 to 6.3 +/- 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute (P less than 0.05), whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused a decrease from 6.4 +/- 2.0 to 5.7 +/- 1.9 (P less than 0.01). Captopril had no effect on the basal insulin concentration, but it decreased the late (30- to 90-minute) insulin response to glucose and increased the early (2- to 6-minute) insulin peak. Hydrochlorothiazide increased the basal insulin concentration and the late insulin response to glucose. These findings may be explained by an increase in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a decrease with hydrochlorothiazide. Little or no change was seen in serum lipid or lipoprotein levels during treatment with captopril, whereas hydrochlorothiazide caused significant increases in serum total (5 percent) and low-density lipoprotein (6 percent) cholesterol levels and total (15 percent) and very-low-density lipoprotein (25 percent) triglyceride levels, as compared with placebo (P less than 0.01 for all comparisons). We conclude that hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of essential hypertension has adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. It is possible, but not proved in this study, that these changes may contribute to the risk for diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. In contrast, captopril appears to have beneficial or no effects on glucose and lipid metabolism.\r"

To map the residues of the HIV-1 glycoprotein that are critical for binding and to analyse the effects of binding on viral infectivity, we created 15 mutations in a region of gp120 that is important for binding to CD4 (refs 4,5). We find that substitution of a single amino acid (tryptophan at position 432) can abrogate CD4 binding and that virus carrying this mutation is non-infectious. By contrast, other amino-acid changes in the same region do not affect CD4 binding but restrict viral tropism: virions containing isoleucine substitutions at position 425 lose their ability to infect a monocyte cell line (U937 cells) but can still infect T-lymphocyte cell lines (CEM, SUP-T1) and activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results indicate that cellular tropism of HIV can be influenced by a single amino-acid change in gp120.\r"

This regulated transcriptional response is mediated through specific promoter elements located, in general, upstream from the transcription start site. In Escherichia coli the element responsible for cAMP-mediated transcriptional induction is the binding site for the cAMP-receptor protein (CAP). In mammalian cells the cAMP regulatory element is composed of one or more binding sites for various transcription factors. In many instances the cAMP regulatory element contains binding sites for a family of proteins referred to as ATF. Here we provide evidence that some prokaryotic and mammalian cAMP-response elements are functionally related. First, we show that mammalian ATF binds specifically to some E. coli CAP sites, and conversely E. coli CAP binds specifically to some mammalian ATF sites. Second, we demonstrate that an E. coli CAP binding site can confer cAMP-inducibility onto a mammalian gene when assayed in transfected mammalian cells.\r"

  ".U": "89365180\r", 
  ".W": "During transcription in E. coli, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase locates specific promoter sequences in the DNA template, melts a small region containing the transcription start site, initiates RNA synthesis, processively elongates the transcript, and finally terminates and releases the RNA product. Each step is regulated by interactions between the polymerase, the DNA, the nascent RNA, and a variety of regulatory proteins and ligands. The E. coli enzyme contains a catalytic core of two alpha-subunits, one beta- and one beta'-subunit, with relative molecular masses (Mr) of 36,512, 150,619 and 155,162, respectively. The holoenzyme has an additional regulatory subunit, normally sigma, of Mr 70,236. Preparations may also contain the omega-subunit (Mr approximately 10,000), which can be removed without affecting any known properties of the enzyme. Because the amino-acid sequences of the beta- and beta'-subunits are homologous to those of the largest subunits of the yeast, Drosophila and murine RNA polymerases, it seems likely that essential features of the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanism of RNA polymerase are also conserved across species. Crystals of RNA polymerase suitable for X-ray analysis have not yet been obtained, but two-dimensional crystals of E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme can be grown on positively charged lipid layers. Electron microscopy of these crystals in negative stain shows the enzyme in projection as an irregularly shaped complex approximately 100 x 100 x 160 A in size. We have now determined the three-dimensional structure by electron microscopy of negatively stained, two-dimensional crystals tilted at various angles to the incident electron beam. We find a structure in RNA polymerase similar to the active-site cleft of DNA polymerase I. In the light of functional similarities between these two enzymes, together with other evidence, this probably identifies the active-site region of RNA polymerase.\r"

  ".W": "The primary event in the pathogenesis of severe malaria in Plasmodium falciparum infection is thought to be adherence of trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocytes to capillary endothelium, a process called sequestration. Identifying the endothelial molecules used as receptors is an essential step in understanding this disease process. Recent work implicates the membrane glycoprotein CD36 (platelet glycoprotein IV; refs 2-5) and the multi-functional glycoprotein thrombospondin as receptors. Although CD36 has a widespread distribution on microvascular endothelium, it may not be expressed on all capillary beds where sequestration occurs, especially in the brain. The role of thrombospondin in cell adhesion, in vitro or in vivo, is less certain. We have noticed that some parasites bind to human umbilical-vein endothelial cells independently of CD36 or thrombospondin. To screen for alternative receptors, we have developed a novel cell-adhesion assay using transfected COS cells, which confirms that CD36 is a cell-adhesion receptor. In addition, we find that an endothelial-binding line of P. falciparum binds to COS cells transfected with a complementary DNA encoding intercellular adhesion molecule-1. As this molecule is widely distributed on capillaries and is inducible, this finding may be relevant to the pathogenesis of severe malaria.\r"

  ".U": "89365193\r", 
  ".W": "Human complement protein C9 is a hydrophilic serum glycoprotein responsible for efficient expression of the cytotoxic and cytolytic functions of complement. It assembles on the surface of a target cell together with C5, C6, C7 and C8 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC) and therefore has to change structure to become an integral membrane protein. As the protein assumes a stable structure in an aqueous environment, the question arises as to how it can enter the hydrophobic interior of a membrane. During MAC assembly C9 polymerizes into a circular structure, termed poly(C9) (ref. 8), which is responsible for the cylindrical electron microscopic appearance of the MAC. The suggestion has been made that C9 must at least partly unfold in order to enter a membrane and also that polymerization of the molecule is intimately linked to insertion and cytotoxicity. The extent of unfolding and the mechanism of polymerization are not understood, nor is it known precisely which parts of the molecule participate in the proposed structural changes. We have been able to capture refolding C9 conformers during membrane insertion with the help of sequence-specific anti-peptide antibodies. Some of these antibodies inhibit C9-mediated haemolysis but not C9 polymerization, while others have the opposite effect. This suggests that the two processes are independent.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term results obtained in a series of 174 patients operated on for spinal meningiomas are critically analyzed. This series was similar to those of other authors with regard to age, sex, location of the tumors, and clinical presentation. Before surgery, about 70% of the patients were included in Groups I and II (mild neurological impairment), and about 30% of the patients were classified in Groups III and IV (significant to severe neurological impairment, up to paraplegia). Complete tumor removal was achieved in 96.5% of the patients, and surgical mortality was about 1%. Microsurgical technique, which was adopted in the last 29 cases, proved to be very effective in reducing undue damage to the spinal cord and in minimizing the postoperative neurological deficits. Of the 174 patients who underwent surgery, 156 underwent late follow-up study for an average of 15 years (2 patients died in the immediate postoperative period, and 16 patients were lost to follow-up). Twenty-nine patients died of causes unrelated to the spinal meningioma; of the remaining 126 patients, 92% were categorized in Groups I and II, and only 8% in Groups III and IV. The rate of recurrence was 6% (9 patients) among the 150 patients who had complete tumor removal, and the rate of regrowth was 17% (1 patient with anaplastic meningioma) among the 6 patients treated by subtotal removal. The early diagnosis of the disease and the use of microsurgical technique appeared as the most relevant factors for further improvement of the surgical results.\r"

  ".W": "This experiment was designed to study the effects of intravascular volume expansion with crystalloid and colloid agents on intracranial pressure (ICP) and computerized electroencephalographic (EEG) data in dogs with cerebral vasogenic edema. A liquid nitrogen cold lesion was produced in the right parietal lobes of 30 anesthetized mongrel dogs. ICP data from an intraventricular catheter, hemodynamic data, and EEG power data were recorded continuously during the course of the experiment. Six hours after creation of the liquid nitrogen cold lesion, each dog was infused with one of the following treatments: 1) no treatment (control); 2) 5% dextrose in water (D5W) (30 ml/kg/h); 3) 0.9% NaCl (30 ml/kg/h); 4) hetastarch (10 ml/kg/h); and 5) hetastarch (30 ml/kg/h). The animals were treated for 2 hours, killed, and the brains examined and measured for water content. During the D5W infusion, ICP increased significantly (141%) but the EEG power data did not change. During the normal saline infusion, ICP increased significantly (91%) and the EEG power data showed marked deterioration. Both hetastarch infusions produced no change in ICP and demonstrated an improvement in the EEG power data (P less than 0.001). These data suggest that crystalloid infusions may have profound deleterious effects in the presence of brain edema, but colloids do not, and should be considered in the fluid management of patients with cerebral edema.\r"

Of the 50 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy, 3 were neurologically worse after the procedure (morbidity, 6%), and 3 additional patients with Grade 4 astrocytomas who preoperatively were rapidly deteriorating neurologically, died within 30 days of the procedure. Of the 28 patients who underwent stereotactic resection, 14 were neurologically improved after the procedure, 10 were unchanged, and 4 were worse. One additional patient died 10 days postoperatively. Thirty-four patients had Grade 4 astrocytomas: 27 underwent stereotactic biopsies. The mean survival after biopsy and irradiation for patients with Grade 4 astrocytomas was 21.4 weeks. The mean survival was 62 weeks in 7 patients with Grade 4 astrocytomas who underwent stereotactic resection and radiation therapy. The mean survival time after biopsy and radiation therapy for patients who had Grade 3 and Grade 2 lesions was 54.4 weeks and 91 weeks, respectively. Twenty-three patients had pilocytic astrocytomas; 8 underwent stereotactic biopsies, and 19 underwent stereotactic resection of the tumor (4 of these underwent biopsy prior to resection). There was no neurological morbidity, but one patient died after resection. Many of those who underwent resection were deteriorating due to an enlarging tumor mass or recurring cyst, and had undergone more conservative therapies such as biopsy and radiation. Even though stereotactic biopsy is appropriate in many patients harboring thalamic astrocytomas, selected patients with significant mass effect from solid tumor or recurring cyst can benefit from stereotactic resection.\r"

An immunohistochemical analysis of frozen sections revealed that 90% of the germinoma-infiltrating lymphocytes were CD3-positive T cells expressing CD4, CD8, and HLA Class I and Class II antigens, but were negative for CD16, CD20, CD23, CD25 and CD14 antigens. After in vitro cultivation in the presence of high concentrations of IL-2, the lymphocytes proliferated for 2 weeks, showing marked DNA synthesis. In addition, the lymphocytes could lyse NK-resistant allogeneic target cells.

PE also produced significant reductions in IgA, IgM, C3, and fibrinogen. PE patients had moderately enhanced improvement at 2 weeks relative to the sham group. PE patients with relapsing/remitting disease had significantly enhanced improvement at 4 weeks and there was also an increased improvement at 12 months, although this latter effect disappeared when we analyzed relapsing/remitting patients as a separate subgroup. Life table analysis showed the median time to recover preattack disability status was shorter in PE- than in sham-treated relapsing/remitting patients (4 vs. 13 weeks), a result confirmed by raw disability status scores in which there was recovery to their average preattack disability score by 3 months. PE given with ACTH plus cyclophosphamide enhances recovery from an exacerbation of disease in relapsing/remitting patients, although we observed no clear long-term benefits.\r"

Thermographic abnormality was defined as the presence of either interside temperature difference exceeding 3 standard deviations from the normal mean, or an abnormal heat pattern overlying the lumbosacral spine. In patients with clinically unequivocal radiculopathy, thermography and electrophysiologic study were similar in diagnostic sensitivity, and the 2 methods agreed on the presence or absence of abnormality in 71% of cases. However, the thermographic findings had limited localizing value. Relative limb warming was often seen in patients with acute denervation on EMG, and limb cooling in those with more chronic lesions, but the side of the root lesion could not be identified confidently by thermography alone. Moreover, thermographic abnormalities appeared not to follow a dermatomal distribution and failed to identify the clinical or electrophysiologic level of radiculopathy in most cases. Thus, the thermographic findings are nonspecific, of little diagnostic value, and of uncertain prognostic relevance.\r"

However, many other functions entail cleavage of membrane lipids to yield (as examples): unsaturated fatty acids, which are converted to prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and other compounds; diacylglycerols, which activate protein kinase C; inositol phosphates, which stimulate release of calcium from intracellular stores; and lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine, which is converted to platelet-activating factor. New roles for membrane lipids are constantly appearing, such as the inhibition of protein kinase C by sphingosine and the release of phosphatidylinositol-linked proteins in response to hormones. Dietary modification of these lipid systems could have important implications for normal cell function and disease.\r"

When enzyme secretion was stimulated by carbamylcholine or acetylcholine (with eserine) in slices of pigeon pancreas, the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipide fraction of the stimulated slices was, after 2 hours, 4.8 to 8.7 (average, 7.0) times greater than the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipides of control slices. Neither respiration nor the incorporation of P32 into acid-soluble phosphate esters was increased. 2. Pilocarpine, which on a weight for weight basis was much less effective than carbamylcholine or acetylcholine in stimulating enzyme secretion in pancreas slices, was also much less effective in stimulating the uptake of P32 into phospholipides. 3. The stimulatory effects of carbamylcholine on both enzyme secretion and the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides were abolished by atropine. 4. The specific activity of the phospholipides from slices incubated anaerobically was less than 5 per cent of that observed aerobically. Anaerobically, carbamylcholine did not stimulate the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides to any significant extent. The specific activity of the acid-soluble phosphate esters after anaerobic incubation was 34 per cent of that found aerobically. 5. Cholinergic drugs had little or no effect on the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipides of the following tissue slices: pigeon and guinea pig liver, guinea pig heart ventricle, pigeon gizzard (smooth muscle), and guinea pig kidney cortex. A relatively slight stimulation of P32 uptake into phospholipides was observed in slices of pigeon brain (65 per cent) and guinea pig brain cortex (40 per cent). 6. Stimulation of amylase synthesis in slices of pigeon pancreas by the addition of a mixture of amino acids had no effect on the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides.\r"

To evaluate the role of direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIFM) in identifying temporal arteritis, the authors reviewed all temporal artery biopsies done over a 30-month period (100 consecutive biopsies). The DIFM, using antibodies to IgG, IgM, IgA, complement, and fibrinogen, had a diagnostic sensitivity rate of 93% and a specificity rate of 87% compared with light microscopy. In biopsy specimens showing arteritis by light microscopy, IgG was demonstrated by DIFM in 85% of cases, IgM in 69%, and IgA in 15%. In one patient, a DIFM staining pattern highly suspicious of temporal arteritis identified a patient with features of clinical temporal arteritis despite negative findings by light microscopy. The demonstration of immunoglobulin by DIFM supports the possible role of humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of temporal arteritis.\r"

Enzyme immunoassay and IF were equally sensitive (P = 0.5), with sensitivities of 80.6 and 79.0%, respectively, when swab specimens were collected from patients within 7 days of the onset of clinical symptoms of adenovirus infection. After 7 days of clinical onset, IF (46.2%) was more sensitive (P less than 0.01) than EIA (0.0%), and was able to detect residual antigen in three culture-negative specimens. Enzyme immunoassay and IF were equally specific (100%). Both tests were easy to interpret, but IF was more technically complex and is not yet commercially packaged. Enzyme immunoassay could benefit either an office practice or a central laboratory, whereas IF is better suited for the latter.\r"

Mast cells have been shown to play a role in several fibrotic disorders, but the role of mast cells in OCP is unknown. The authors compared the mast cell population in conjunctival biopsy specimens from 14 OCP patients and from six controls by using specific histochemical stains for mast cell subsets. The total mast cell number and the ratio of connective tissue mast cells to mucosal mast cells (MMCs) were significantly higher in OCP than in normal conjunctiva (P less than 0.05). This report is the first analysis of mast cell subsets in human ocular tissue. The results suggest that connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs) may play an important role in OCP and that therapy directed toward mast cells and their mediators may be an appropriate avenue for further exploration.\r"

By immunohistochemical methods, the authors determined the presence of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VI, in seven corneal buttons from five patients with Peters' anomaly. Type III collagen was the only protein absent in either the pathologic or normal human corneas. Compared with normal controls, the stromal lamellae in Peters' anomaly corneas were more irregular and more closely packed. In addition, the fibronectin staining was markedly enhanced in all seven Peters' anomaly corneas. Staining with collagen type VI was also mildly increased. These results suggest that extracellular matrix elements such as fibronectin may be important factors in this developmental disorder.\r"

These tissues were from normal tongue, gingiva, lip, and submandibular gland, and from Dilantin gingival hyperplasia (one case), pyogenic granuloma (three cases), peripheral fibroma (four cases), squamous cell carcinoma (seven cases), chronic sclerosing submandibular adenitis (two cases), and fibrous dysplasia of the mandibular bone (one case). The distribution of collagenous components was examined in the same tissues by means of the Sirius red F3BA method. By means of the ABC method, FXIIIa was detected in the cytoplasm of certain connective tissue cells in each of the tissues examined. These FXIIIa-containing cells were sparse in the normal tissues but evidently abundant in the fibrous connective tissue of inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. In the present study, the close relationship between the distribution of FXIIIa-containing cells and that of collagenous components is demonstrated. The role that FXIIIa-containing cells play in the process of fibrosis is discussed.\r"

The findings for commissural lip pits (boys 53.1, girls 52.4 per 1000) are less than those reported for adults. This may indicate that pits become accentuated with age. Fordyce granules were seen with a prevalence of 1.2 per 1000. This is in contrast to the reported 85.6% prevalence for the adult population, also possibly reflecting increased manifestation with increased age. Our data for exogenous tooth pigmentation show increased prevalence with age (group I [5 to 10 1/2 years], 9.8%, versus group II [10 1/2 to 14 1/2 years], 12.9%), possibly indicating decrease in attention to oral hygiene. The prevalence of talon cusp was found to be 0.6 per 1000, and for ankyloglossia 8.3 per 1000. Prevalence values for bifid tongue are reported for the first time, indicating one affected per 187 children examined. The prevalence of fissured tongue (15.7%) shows a statistically significant difference between boys (16.8%) and girls (14.5%).

A low-viscosity resin may seal a root canal by flowing into clean dentinal tubules after smear layer removal. This investigation with scanning electron microscopy examines the efficacy of two methods of root canal preparation and the effectiveness of different chemicals on smear layer removal. Ultrasonic preparation with 0.25% sodium hypochlorite solution and final agitation with 50% citric acid solution were found to produce a very clean canal wall, free of smear layer in coronal and middle parts. However, low-viscosity resin used in conditions that aimed to simulate in vivo conditions failed to penetrate open dentinal tubules to a significant extent. On the basis of these observations made with scanning electron microscopy, low-viscosity resins would not seem suitable as root canal filling materials, because they are unlikely to form a satisfactory adaption to the canal wall. In addition, if treatment fails, these resins are impossible to remove from a root canal without much destruction of tooth substance.\r"

Laundry detergent ingestions are generally considered to have minor consequences, and there exists a paucity of literature on the subject. Evidence of significant morbidity incurred because of ingestion or inhalation of sodium carbonate-containing laundry detergent powder is presented, together with a review of the existing literature.\r"

  ".W": "A study of the natural history of sickle hemoglobinopathies was begun in March 1979. By August 1987, a total of 2824 patients less than 20 years of age were enrolled. There have been 14,670 person-years of follow-up. Seventy-three deaths have occurred. Most of the deaths were in patients with hemoglobin SS. The peak incidence of death was between 1 and 3 years of age, and the major cause in these young patients was infection. Cerebrovascular accidents and traumatic events exceeded infections as a cause of death in patients greater than 10 years of age. There was limited success in identifying risk factors for death. Comparison of this study's overall mortality of 2.6% (0.5 deaths per 100 person-years) with previous reports indicates improvement of survival in US patients less than 20 years of age with sickle hemoglobinopathies. This improvement is most likely due to parental education and counseling about the illness and the early institution of antibiotics in suspected infections.\r"

If current trends continue, AIDS can be expected to move into the top five leading causes of death in the pediatric and adolescent age group in the next 3 or 4 years. To address this problem and also to provide focus for the US Department of Health and Human Services activities dealing with pediatric AIDS, an intradepartmental work group was established as a central health and human services component. This was done to ensure the best possible use of federal resources on behalf of children and adolescents with AIDS. Its recommendations are the basis of this report.\r"

The nurse must be prepared to make a thorough assessment of the client's learning needs, develop and implement an effective teaching plan, evaluate learning, and revise the plan as necessary, as well as document the teaching. All of this must be achieved to ensure continuity of quality patient care and reimbursement by third-party payers.\r"

  ".W": "The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 set forth new provisions for Medicare and Medicaid sections related to new standards for care in the nursing home setting. One major provision was for nurse aide training. Within that provision there are four specified requirements: (1) nurse aide training for 75 hours, (2) competency evaluation of newly trained nurse aides, (3) competency evaluation of nurse aides already providing care, and (4) a registry for nurse aides. The primary implications of the these requirements center on the responsibility of the individual nurse or nurse community in ensuring appropriate implementation of the new requirement. Without appropriate implementation, some of the provisions increase the liability of the nurse and the risk to the public. The reality of OBRA 1987 and its intent of bringing a measure of quality assurance to the nursing home industry should only serve as an impetus for the nursing community to better translate the nurse role and its contribution in the nursing home setting to policy makers at local, state, and federal levels.\r"

Rupture of the Achilles tendon and dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon should be readily diagnosed because the history, symptoms, and signs are characteristic. Rupture of the peroneal tendons is rare, and dislocation cannot be diagnosed with certainty unless it is seen promptly or can be reproduced on examination. Treatment of any of these conditions may be operative or nonoperative.\r"

Exclusion of coronary artery disease is a key element of the management of noncardiac chest pain. Once this is accomplished, the physician can address the fears and concerns of the patient with confidence and often avoid any diagnostic studies of the esophagus. When diagnostic studies are performed, the physician should be mindful of their limitations. Since gastroesophageal reflux disease is probably the most common cause of esophageal chest pain, prompt recognition and treatment of this disorder may provide relief for many patients. Future studies should address the relationship between physiologic events in the esophagus and chest pain.\r"
