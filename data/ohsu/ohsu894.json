  ".W": "Leuprolide acetate was used in 189 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Patients were allocated prospectively into two groups: In group A (96 cycles), leuprolide acetate was started on the 2nd menstrual cycle day of the actual IVF attempt. In group B (93 cycles), leuprolide acetate was started on the 3rd luteal phase day of the preceding IVF cycle. Ovulation was induced with a combination of pure follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), starting on or before the 5th cycle day, respectively. Leuprolide acetate and gonadotropins were continued until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Follicular aspiration was carried out either by laparoscopy or by transvaginal ultrasound guidance. Group A required a lower number of FSH and hMG ampules than group B; nevertheless, there was no difference in the number of follicles, percentage of preovulatory oocytes or fertilization rate between the groups. The number of embryos transferred was 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. A significantly higher pregnancy rate was observed in group A (40.6% versus 27.7%) and a lower miscarriage rate (22.8% versus 36%) than in group B. In short, this study suggests that there is no need to administer leuprolide acetate routinely during the luteal phase of the preceding IVF cycle.\r"

All groups received estradiol (E2) benzoate (12.5 micrograms intramuscularly on cycle days 2 to 33) and progesterone (P) (silastic implant for cycle days 14 to 33). A gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) (Lupron 0.5 mg daily, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Chicago, IL) was administered from cycle day 2 to 14 in group II and from day 20 of the previous cycle until cycle day 14 in group III. Oral CC was given on cycle days 3 through 7 in group IV. No significant differences of mean E2 and P concentrations were noted between groups. Neither GnRH-a nor CC had an overall effect on E2/P-induced hyperprolactinemia. However, for the 5-day interval at the onset of the P treatment there was a significant increase in prolactin (PRL) secretion for group II (130.4 +/- 30.6) versus group I (53.9 +/- 3.3), group III (64.4 +/- 11.1), and group IV (68.8 +/- 14.3). This suggests that leuprolide may exert a delayed stimulatory effect on PRL secretion, or that complete suppression of the putative paracrine regulation of PRL stimulation may require more than 13 days of GnRH-a administration.\r"

Midfollicular, midcycle, and castrate urines and their corresponding serum samples were assessed for LH activity using established RIAs as well as urinary ovulation kits. Macaque LH did not sufficiently cross-react with the human urinary anti-LH antibodies in any of the predictor test kits. Although these kits offer excellent results in predicting ovulation by measurement of urinary LH in humans, they appear not to be applicable for urinary LH detection in rhesus nor cynomolgus macaques.\r"

The effects of misoprostol were compared with those of 5-aminosalicylic acid and betamethasone. A single application of 4% acetic acid induced an experimental colitis which was maximal at 2 days and showed spontaneous macroscopic and histologic healing by 12 days. Misoprostol (100 micrograms/kg), but not 5-aminosalicylic acid or betamethasone, administered 30 min before induction of colitis, provided macroscopic and histologic colonic mucosal protection but not protection of in vivo fluid absorption. The mucosal protective effect of misoprostol was time, dose, and diluent volume dependent. In the presence of misoprostol-induced colonic morphologic but not functional absorptive mucosal protection, in vitro unidirectional sodium and chloride flux measurements showed protection of theophylline-stimulated chloride secretion but not sodium absorption. Protection of in vivo colonic fluid absorption, in addition to morphologic protection, could be achieved when misoprostol was administered between 2 and 16 min before induction of colitis or when the highest dose (1000 micrograms/kg) of misoprostol was examined. We conclude that intracolonic misoprostol administration provides unique mucosal protective effects in experimental colitis.\r"

  ".U": "90128043\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide is distributed in a number of organs including the large intestine. Atrial natriuretic peptide has potent diuretic and natriuretic properties and appears to play a central role in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by an action on the kidney. We examined the influence of atrial natriuretic peptide on mammalian colon because this organ is also intimately involved in homeostasis. Segments of the distal colons of male Sprague-Dawley rats were stripped of muscle layers and mounted in flux chambers. Atrial natriuretic peptide, when added to the serosal side of the mucosa, in concentrations ranging from 10(-8)-10(-5) M, caused a rapid, concentration-dependent increase in short-circuit current, transmucosal electrical potential difference, and conductance. The response to atrial natriuretic peptide was inhibited by (a) chloride-free solution on the serosal surface; (b) pretreatment of the tissues with the chloride channel blocker, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (10(-3) M mucosally); (c) pretreatment with d,l-verapamil (10(-4) M mucosally and serosally); (d) calcium-free solution on the serosal surface; (e) pretreatment with tetrodotoxin (10(-7) M to serosal surface); and (f) pretreatment with atropine (10(-5) M serosally). However, the response to atrial natriuretic peptide was not influenced by pretreatment with amiloride (10(-4) M to mucosal and serosal surfaces) or piroxicam (10(-5) M serosally). Atrial natriuretic peptide did not elicit an increase in short-circuit current and potential difference across T84 cells derived from a human colonic carcinoma cell line, suggesting that the response to atrial natriuretic peptide is not due to a direct effect on colonocytes. These findings suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide acts by a calcium-mediated secretory mechanism involving cholinergic nerves and is likely to be involved in the endogenous neurohumoral regulation of ion transport in the mammalian colon.\r"

  ".W": "Age-specific changes in glycosylation of rat intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase were analyzed using enzyme immunoprecipitated from microvillus membranes of suckling, weaning, and adult rats, and carbohydrate moieties were examined by lectin affinity binding, metabolic labeling, and neuraminidase treatment. Lectin binding indicated the presence of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing mannose and galactose throughout development. An age-dependent shift in sialic acid and fucose was seen during the period of weaning; no fucose was detectable in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase until after the rats were 20 days of age, whereas sialic acid was reduced in adult lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. The presence of sialic acid in suckling intestines and fucose in adult was confirmed by metabolic labeling with appropriate radioactive precursors. Sodium dodecyl phosphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitated lactase-phlorizin hydrolase from the proximal and mid small intestine showed two bands of approximately 220 and 130 kilodaltons in all age groups. In the distal part of the adult small intestine, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase appeared as two bands of similar size to those found in the proximal and mid portions. In contrast, during the suckling and weaning periods, these distal bands were approximately 225 and 135 kilodaltons. [35S]-methionine labeling and fluorography of neonatal intestines confirmed these observations. The size difference between proximal and distal small intestines was virtually eliminated by neuraminidase treatment. These data indicate that the core structure of microvillus membrane lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, consisting of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, remains constant during development, although terminal sugars shift from predominantly sialic acid during the suckling period to fucose in adulthood. This alteration in glycosylation of the protein occurs in a different pattern from the postweaning decline in lactase specific activity. Consequently, age-dependent changes in glycosylation cannot account for the decrease in lactase-phlorizin hydrolase-specific activity observed during development.\r"

Both groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex distribution, etiology of liver cirrhosis, history of previous complications, clinical status, liver and renal function, modified Child's score, and nutritional status at admission. The enteral formula diet was energy dense, containing 40 mmol Na/day, whole protein plus branched-chain amino acids, medium- and long-chain triglycerides, and maltodextrin. It supplied 2115 kcal/day. The amount of vitamins and trace elements was at the upper limit of the recommended dietary allowances. The orally fed patients were encouraged to eat all meals served. Total enteral nutrition was well tolerated without major complications. Serum albumin and Child's score improved in the enterally fed patients but not in controls. Mortality rate while in the hospital was lower in patients on enteral feeding than in controls (12% vs 47%). These results show that total enteral nutrition is safe and effective in improving the short-term clinical outcome in severely malnourished cirrhotics.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the relationships between the bile duct and main pancreatic duct sphincters, the resistance to flow through these sphincters was studied simultaneously with perfusion techniques in anesthetized cats. Basal flow resistance was higher in the pancreatic sphincter than in the bile duct sphincter. The pressure in one duct system was not affected by the flow in the other. The muscular activities in the sphincters were usually well coordinated. Distention of the upper biliary tract or the pancreatic duct system reduced the flow resistance in both sphincters. Cholecystokinin-8 (0.01 micrograms), duodenal distention, and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (0.4 mg) also relaxed both sphincters, whereas secretin in a dose that induced pancreatic secretion had no consistent effect. Morphine increased flow resistance in both systems. These functional studies indicate that the 2 sphincters share smooth muscle fibers at the level where the flow resistances arise, and there are thus no grounds for separate control of the sphincters. There was no evidence of a functionally common sphincter ampulla. The conclusions drawn from the manometric results were supported by morphological findings in this study.\r"

To determine the basal and stimulated profiles of PGE2 and PGI2 production along the corticomedullary axis of the dog kidney, a slice (0.5 mm thick, 10-50 mg) was obtained from six equally spaced zones along the axis (zone 1, medullary crest; zones 2 and 3, inner medulla; zone 4, outer medulla; and zones 5 and 6, cortex) and was divided into equal halves. One half of the slice was incubated with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing arachidonic acid (6.6 x 10(-4) M), bradykinin (9.4 x 10(-6) M), or indomethacin (10(-5) M), whereas the remaining half of each slice was similarly incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer alone. The production of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2) was determined by radioimmunoassay. Under basal conditions, both PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were highest in the innermost zones of the inner medulla (PGE2, 3,328 +/- 549 pg/mg; 6-keto-PGF 1 alpha, 1,611 +/- 129 pg/mg) and decreased exponentially to low levels in the cortex (PGE2, undetectable; 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, 13 +/- 2 pg/mg); this production was inhibited by indomethacin. Arachidonic acid significantly increased the production of PGE2 in all zones of the kidney and the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha only in zones 3-6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We reported that dexamethasone treatment of rabbits causes a reduction in renal vasoconstrictor responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619, an agonist at the thromboxane-endoperoxide receptor, but not to phenylephrine. The purpose of this study was to examine if dexamethasone treatment can affect the renal vasodilatory responses to prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in isolated Krebs-perfused kidneys constricted with phenylephrine. In kidneys from dexamethasone-treated rabbits, the vasodilatory response to PGI2 was reduced by 57%, whereas that to PGE2 was converted to a vasoconstrictor response. This effect of dexamethasone appears to be specific in that the renal vasodilatory responses to forskolin and to sodium nitroprusside were not affected by the steroid. Contrasting with the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on prostanoid-induced renal vasodilation, treatment with dexamethasone augmented the renal vasodilatory response to arachidonic acid; for example, arachidonic acid, at 10 micrograms decreased perfusion pressure by 24.8 +/- 5.4 and 49.0 +/- 5.6 mm Hg in kidneys from vehicle- and dexamethasone-treated rabbits, respectively. The enhanced vasodilatory effect of arachidonic acid could not be attributed to increased renal formation of PGE2 and PGI2. In conclusion, dexamethasone interferes with prostanoid-mediated renal vasodilation, which is not associated with an impairment in renal responsiveness to direct activators of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase. The reciprocal effect of dexamethasone on the renal vascular responses to arachidonic acid and vasodilatory prostanoids are indicative of a previously unrecognized influence of glucocorticoids on the renal arachidonate-prostaglandin system.\r"

Long-term treatment induced a clinical and biochemical improvement in eight, and this was associated with a reduction in maxillary or skull volume as assessed by quantitative stereophotogrammetry. The one patient whose disease was resistant to treatment with diphosphonate, showed no change in maxillary shape. These studies suggest that the long-term control of disease activity attained with diphosphonates, results in the improvement of skeletal deformity.\r"

  ".U": "90130912\r", 
  ".W": "It is well known that GH responses to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) show marked interindividual variations in normal subjects, which have been attributed to a variable somatostatinergic tone. Recently, it has been shown that enhancement of cholinergic tone with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine (PD), which presumably acts by inhibiting somatostatin release, stimulates basal GH secretion and GH responses to a maximal dose of GHRH. In this study we have investigated the effects of PD on the dose-response relationships of GHRH-induced GH secretion in normal subjects. Our data showed that PD (120 mg, orally, at-60 min) induced a clear-cut increase in basal GH levels, significantly different from that after saline treatment, at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Moreover, PD administration markedly potentiated GH responses to GHRH at doses of 500, 100, 25, 10, and 3 micrograms/subject, as assessed by either area under the curve or maximal peak GH levels. In fact, GH responses to pyridostigmine plus 3 micrograms GHRH were similar to those to the administration of 500 and 100 micrograms GHRH alone. Our findings of marked increases in GH response to GHRH after pyridostigmine administration show that with enhancement of cholinergic tone, the dose of GHRH needed to induce a similar increase in GH is reduced 30 times.\r"

  ".U": "90130913\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the differential regulation of glycoprotein hormone secretion from the gonadotrope by GnRH, the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist was administered to euthyroid women in the early follicular phase (days 1-5) of the menstrual cycle, and the results compared to previous studies with the Nal-Arg GnRH antagonist. After a 4-h period of baseline sampling at a frequency of every 10 min, a single sc dose of the GnRH antagonist was administered to each subject. Frequent sampling continued for 8 h, followed by hourly sampling for a further 16 h. LH, FSH, and free alpha-subunit were measured serially in assays with high specificity. There was a 90% concordance of LH and free alpha-subunit pulses during the baseline sampling period. Pulsatile secretion of LH and free alpha-subunit was immediately abolished at the highest dose of the Nal-Glu antagonist for at least 8 h. The maximum percent suppression of LH after administration of the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist was 70 +/- 4%, 80 +/- 4%, and 83 +/- 1% at doses of 15, 50, and 150 micrograms/kg, respectively, compared to 51 +/- 10%, 70 +/- 5%, and 69 +/- 5% at doses of 50, 150, and 500 micrograms/kg Nal-Arg antagonist. Decreases in FSH were 28 +/- 2%, 32 +/- 7%, and 39 +/- 2%, with increasing doses of the Nal-Glu antagonist compared with 25 +/- 6%, 17 +/- 6%, and 28 +/- 4% reductions at increasing doses of the Nal-Arg antagonist. Free alpha-subunit decreased 22 +/- 4%, 23 +/- 4%, and 28 +/- 3% at increasing doses of the Nal-Glu antagonist and 12 +/- 4%, 27 +/- 4%, and 30 +/- 7% with increasing doses of the Nal-Arg antagonist. For the Nal-Glu antagonist, suppression of LH was greater than that of FSH and free alpha-subunit at all doses (P less than 0.001), while FSH suppression was greater than that of free alpha-subunit at the highest dose only (P less than 0.05). For the Nal-Arg antagonist, LH suppression was greater than that of FSH or free alpha-subunit at all doses (P greater than 0.01), and FSH suppression exceeded that of free alpha-subunit at the 50 micrograms/kg dose. Suppression of LH was greater with the Nal-Glu antagonist than with the Nal-Arg antagonist at doses of 50 and 150 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.05), and FSH suppression was greater with the Nal-Glu antagonist at 150 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.01), while the degrees of maximum suppression were similar for the two different GnRH antagonists for free alpha-subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In addition, fasting plasma ANP levels were assayed in 12 elderly male (ages 62-86 yr) and 9 elderly female subjects (ages 64-80 yr) on at least two separate occasions. The average daily ANP levels in the young women were much higher than those in the men (68.1 +/- 5.5 vs. 39.8 +/- 3.4 pmol/L; P less than 0.001), although no cyclical changes in ANP levels were observed. ANP levels were 94.0 +/- 17.9 pmol/L in elderly men and 78.3 +/- 19.4 pmol/L in elderly women. Aldosterone levels were higher in women than men during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (1154 +/- 125 vs 488 +/- 42 pmol/L; P less than 0.001), but not during the periovulatory period (580 +/- 103 pmol/L) or during menses (563 +/- 61 pmol/L). In conclusion, ANP levels in young women average approximately twice those in young men, but do not fluctuate with the cyclical changes in estrogen, progesterone, and aldosterone seen during the menstrual cycle. However, ANP levels in postmenopausal women are not greater than those in age-matched elderly men. Thus, gender appears to affect the secretion or metabolism of ANP during the premenopausal years of life.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogens exert both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on the secretion of GnRH and gonadotropins in women. The endogenous opioid peptides seem to mediate, at least in part, the inhibitory action exerted by estrogens on LH secretion. However, the mechanisms that mediate the stimulatory effect of estrogens on LH secretion are still unclear. The present study was performed to evaluate whether the endogenous opioid peptides could also participate in the stimulatory effect that estrogens exert on the gonadotropin response to GnRH. In postmenopausal women, a GnRH test was performed both under basal conditions and during the second month of treatment with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol (E2). In untreated postmenopausal women, two different doses of naloxone infusion failed to modify the LH and FSH responses to GnRH stimulation. During treatment with transdermal E2, the LH response to GnRH was significantly increased, while the FSH response was similar to that before treatment. Naloxone completely counteracted the enhanced LH response to GnRH observed during E2 treatment. On the other hand, naloxone did not significantly modify the FSH response to GnRH. The present results confirm that E2 exerts a sensitizing effect on the pituitary LH response to GnRH and suggest that the endogenous opioid system could be involved in this effect.\r"

Blood samples were obtained every 15 min over 24 h, and TSH, LH and FSH were measured by immunoradiometric assays. Hormone pulses were located by cluster analysis, and pulse patterns were compared to those in normal subjects. Three patients had unmeasurable LH levels, while two had a normal number of low amplitude pulses. In contrast, all patients had normal FSH pulse frequency, and only one had low pulse amplitude. Three patients had normal 24-h TSH pulse frequency and amplitude, while two had slightly decreased pulse parameters. However, all failed to show normal nocturnal increases in TSH pulse amplitude. Thus, anatomical hypothalamic-pituitary lesions disrupt pulsatile glycoprotein secretion in a discordant fashion. LH is most severely affected, with abnormal pulse patterns similar to those in idiopathic central hypogonadism. FSH and TSH pulses are relatively preserved, but loss of the usual nocturnal increase in TSH pulse amplitude is sufficient to cause clinical hypothyroidism. Whether these defects reflect intrinsic pituitary disease or impaired hypothalamic releasing factor function remains to be determined.\r"

Computer-assisted analysis, i.e. the Cluster and Desade programs, revealed means of 9.9 +/- 1.7 (Cluster) and 11.4 +/- 3.9 (Desade) pulses/24 h. More than 50% of the TSH pulses were detected between 2000-0400 h. Male and female subjects showed no significant difference in the basal mean and pulsatile secretion of TSH or in the TSH response to TRH (200 micrograms). Repetition of the TSH secretion analysis in 4 healthy subjects after 1, 2, and 6 months (2 subjects) revealed a significantly better cross-correlation within than between individuals (P less than 0.0001). We modulate the circadian TSH secretion pattern by acute sleep withdrawal or prolonged sleep after a night of sleep withdrawal in six healthy male volunteers. Sleep withdrawal augmented the nightly TSH secretion (mean serum TSH, 2.1 +/- 1.3 mU/L; mean TSH in sleep, 1.3 +/- 0.5 mU/L; P less than 0.05), whereas sleep after sleep withdrawal almost completely suppressed the circadian variation (mean TSH, 1.1 +/- 0.7 mU/L; P less than 0.01). This modulation is due to a significant decrease in pulse amplitude, but not to an alteration in the frequency or temporal distribution of TSH pulses.\r"

  ".W": "A new immunochemiluminometric TSH assay (ICMA) was shown to offer improved analytical (+2 SD of zero) and functional (20% interassay coefficient of variation) sensitivity [0.003 vs 0.045 +/- 0.005 (+/- SE; range, 0.01-0.07); 0.018 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.02 (range, 0.10-0.35, mU/L); analytical vs. functional sensitivity limit for the ICMA vs. 10 other TSH immunometric assays, respectively]. The ICMA was used to study the physiological relationship between serum TSH and free T4 [as reflected by free T4 index (FT4I)] values at both steady state and 14 days after acute pharmacological T4 administration (3 mg oral T4 load plus 0.3 mg daily). At steady state, an inverse log/linear relationship was found between serum TSH and FT4I values (log TSH = 2.56 - 0.022 FT4I; r = 0.84; P less than 0.001). Ten to 14 days after acute T4 suppression in 5 euthyroid subjects, serum TSH/FT4I levels had plateaued after decreasing in parallel to the slope of the steady state relationship, suggesting that the degree of T4 suppression of TSH can be predicted from an individual's pituitary TSH/free T4 set-point and the magnitude of the serum T4 elevation achieved. Ambulatory and hospitalized patient sera, previously identified as having low (less than 0.1 mU/L) TSH levels by a less sensitive assay, were restudied by the TSH ICMA. Normal TSH values ranged from 0.39-4.6 mU/L, whereas the majority of hyperthyroid patients [52 of 54 (96% ambulatory) and 22 of 23 (96%, hospitalized)] had undetectable (less than 0.005 mU/L), basal TSH levels and absent TRH stimulated TSH responses. In contrast, most (32 of 37; 86%) of hospitalized nonhyperthyroid patients with low (less than 0.1 mU/L) TSH values due to nonthyroidal illness or glucocorticoid treatment had detectable (greater than 0.01 mU/L) basal and TRH stimulated TSH levels. The positive relationship between basal and TRH-stimulated TSH levels was shown to extend down to the detectability limit of the assay (0.005 mU/L), which further supported the authenticity of the subnormal TSH ICMA measurements. The new TSH ICMA is considered to represent the first of a third generation of clinical TSH assays, since it has a functional (interassay) sensitivity that is 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of typical first generation TSH RIAs and 1 order of magnitude greater than current second generation TSH immunometric methods. Such third generation TSH assays will facilitate both the optimization of T4 therapy as well as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in hospitalized patients with nonthyroidal illness.\r"

This report describes primary cortisol resistance in a boy with isosexual precocity. A 6 7/12-yr-old boy had Tanner stage 3 pubic hair, accelerated linear growth, and advanced bone age (10 yr), but normal (for age) tests. There were no features of glucocorticoid excess. Serum androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations were 4.7 +/- 0.3 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM of four measurements; normal less than 1.2) and 13.5 nmol/L (single measurement; normal, 1.0-2.2), respectively. The serum testosterone concentration was 0.9 nmol/L (normal, less than 0.7), and FSH and LH were normal. Serum cortisol concentrations were 1590 +/- 110 nmol/L (normal, 190-630) and 580 +/- 60 nmol/L (normal, 50-410) at 0800 and 2000 h, respectively. Serum cortisol responded normally to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens were resistant to suppression by dexamethasone. The Kd of [3H]dexamethasone binding to the glucocorticoid receptors of mononuclear leukocytes was increased (6.4 +/- 0.8 nM; mean +/- SEM of four determinations; normal, 1.4-3.4; P less than 0.001), but the binding capacity was normal. This patient with isosexual precocity has PCR, as indicated by functionally abnormal glucocorticoid receptors and hypercortisolism without other clinical or biochemical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome. Excessive adrenal stimulation by ACTH caused increased secretion of both cortisol and adrenal androgens, and the latter caused the clinical manifestations. PCR should be considered in other male children with isosexual precocity or female children with heterosexual precocity.\r"

In this report the relationship of Tg inhibition to cyclic nucleotide intermediate pathways was explored, and the thyroidal ANP receptor was characterized by affinity cross-linking. Concentrations of Tg, cGMP, and cAMP were measured in medium from thyroid cells cocultured with ANP. ANP significantly inhibited cAMP production at the lower concentration of 0.1 nmol/L and stimulated cGMP levels at a higher concentration of 10 nmol/L. The percentage of inhibition of Tg release over the ANP range of 0.01-10 nmol/L appeared to parallel cAMP, but not cGMP, levels, suggesting that ANP acts via a cAMP pathway in the thyroid. Affinity cross-linking studies characterizing the ANP receptor in thyrocytes and a bovine endothelial cell line known to be cGMP responsive to ANP indicated a single unit ANP receptor of 140 kD coupled to guanylate cyclase in endothelial cells, while a 70-kD receptor was found in thyroid cells which specifically binds to ANP, atriopeptin-I, and atriopeptin-III. These studies in thyrocytes suggest that reduced Tg release may be mediated by a specific single 70-kD ANP receptor associated with an inhibitor cAMP pathway and provide additional insight into the nature of a newly described thyroid-ANP interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Although TRH stimulates the release of uncombined alpha-subunit into the circulation in patients with primary hypothyroidism, it is not clear whether alpha-subunit is released from the thyrotrophs in euthyroid subjects. We hypothesized that spontaneous fluctuations in circulating alpha-subunit released from gonadotrophs by GnRH in normal adults could obscure the detection of small changes in alpha-subunit after TRH administration. We, therefore, examined alpha-subunit responses to TRH in five euthyroid men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), who produce little or no GnRH, five normal men, and four postmenopausal women. Mean (+/- SEM) basal serum alpha-subunit levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) less in men with IHH (0.26 +/- 0.07 microgram/L) than in the normal men (0.80 +/- 0.20 microgram/L) or postmenopausal women (3.54 +/- 0.60 microgram/L). alpha-Subunit levels rose after TRH administration in all men with IHH to a peak level of 0.86 +/- 0.25 ng/ml; TSH levels also increased from 1.9 +/- 0.4 to 13.0 +/- 5.6 mU/L. The increment in TSH and alpha-subunit levels was highly positively correlated (r = 0.96). alpha-Subunit levels also increased 2-fold in normal men given TRH, whereas alpha-subunit levels in postmenopausal women were unchanged. We conclude that thyrotrophs release alpha-subunit into the circulation in normal men and euthyroid men with IHH. Thus, both thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs appear to contribute to circulating alpha-subunit in men with IHH; however, most of the uncombined alpha-subunit in normal men appears to be from gonadotrophs.\r"

However, studies of hypophosphatemic (Hyp) and gyrorotary (Gy) mice indicate that mutations at different loci along the X chromosome may underlie the genetically transmitted hypophosphatemic disorders. Thus, genetic heterogeneity may be a determinant of the phenotypic variability in XLH. To determine if such variance includes biochemical diversity, we examined whether Gy mice, similar to Hyp mice, exhibit abnormal regulation of renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)-1 alpha-hydroxylase. Serum phosphorus in Gy (4.7 +/- 0.3 mg/dl) and phosphate (P)-depleted mice (4.9 +/- 0.4) was significantly less than normal (8.4 +/- 0.5). Consistent with P depletion, the Gy mice exhibited enhanced renal 25(OH)D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (9.3 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg kidney per min), similar to that of P-depleted normals (9.1 +/- 1.5), but significantly greater than that of controls (3.1 +/- 0.3). Such normal enzyme responsiveness was confirmed upon PTH stimulation (1 IU/h s.c.), which revealed that Gy mice increased renal 1-hydroxylase (59 +/- 7.7) similarly to normals (65 +/- 7.7) and P-depleted animals (58.4 +/- 7.8). Calcitonin administration also enhanced enzyme function comparably in the animal models. Evidence confirming normally responsive calcitriol production in untreated Gy mice included increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, gastrointestinal calcium absorption, and urinary calcium. The normally regulated vitamin D metabolism in Gy mice indicates that biochemically diverse disease may result from mutations in the gene family regulating renal P transport and underlying X-linked hypophosphatemia. We suspect such heterogeneity is due to altered P transport at variable segments of the proximal convoluted tubule.\r"

CSF-1 transcripts were undetectable in uninduced HL-60 cells, reached maximal levels by 3 h of exposure to TNF, and returned to that of control cells by 24 h. Transcriptional run-on analysis demonstrated that exposure to TNF stimulated the rate of CSF-1 gene transcription by 6.4-fold. The combination of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and TNF increased levels of CSF-1 mRNA compared with treatment by TNF alone. We also studied the signal transduction mechanisms responsible for regulating TNF-induced CSF-1 mRNA levels. Both 4-bromophenacyl bromide and quinacrine, inhibitors of phospholipase A2 activity, blocked TNF-induced increases in CSF-1 transcripts in a concentration-dependent manner, while caffeic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, had no detectable effect on induction of CSF-1 RNA. PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP treatment of HL-60 cells in the presence of TNF blocked the expression of CSF-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the increase in CSF-1 RNA observed during TNF treatment is regulated, at least in part, by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, and that PGE2 and cAMP regulate transcriptional activation of the CSF-1 gene by TNF.\r"

To examine the control of IGF-I gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes, the human macrophage-like cell line U937 was evaluated at rest and after surface activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Ca2+ ionophore. Northern analysis and RNAse protection analysis with 32P-labeled IGF-I-specific probes demonstrated that the IGF-I mRNA transcripts of resting U937 cells were similar in size and amount to those of resting human alveolar macrophages, mononuclear phagocytes known to express the IGF-I gene. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that surface activation of U937 cells increased the transcription rate of the IGF-I gene four- to fivefold, a process that was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that active protein synthesis was involved in the activation pathway. Despite this, cytoplasmic IGF-I mRNA levels after surface activation declined markedly, a process blocked by a protein kinase C inhibitor (for PMA activation) or a calmodulin antagonist (for Ca2+ ionophore activation). Like the increased transcription of the IGF-I gene, modulation of IGF-I mRNA transcript levels required active protein synthesis; in the presence of cycloheximide constitutive IGF-I mRNA levels increased and surface activation no longer caused a decrease in transcript number. Interestingly, surface activation caused a rapid release of IGF-I, even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that mononuclear phagocytes have a preformed, stored, releasable pool of IGF-I. Together these observations demonstrate that IGF-I gene expression is complex and probably involves control of transcription rate, cytoplasmic mRNA levels possibly mediated through protein kinase C, calcium influx and calmodulin, and finally, release of preformed IGF-I from a storage pool.\r"

We used cultures of chicken osteoclasts to address this issue, and found that 1-hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid (EHDP), dichloromethylidenediphosphonic acid (Cl2MDP), or 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (APD) all cause direct dose-dependent suppression of osteoclastic activity. Effects are mediated by bone-bound drugs, with 50% reduction of bone degradation occurring at 500 nM to 5 microM of the different agents. Osteoclastic bone-binding capacity decreased by 30-40% after 72 h of bisphosphonate treatment, despite maintenance of cell viability. Significant inhibition of bone resorption in each case is seen only after 24-72 h of treatment. Osteoclast activity depends on ATP-dependent proton transport. Using acridine orange as an indicator, we found that EHDP reduces proton accumulation by osteoclasts. However, inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from osteoclasts transport H+ normally in response to ATP in high concentrations of EHDP, Cl2MDP, or APD. This suggests that the bisphosphonates act as metabolic inhibitors. Bisphosphonates reduce osteoclastic protein synthesis, supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, [3H]leucine incorporation by the fibroblast, which does not resorb bone, is also diminished by EHDP, Cl2MDP and APD except when co-cultured with bisphosphonate-binding bone particles. Thus, the resorption-antagonizing capacities of EHDP, Cl2MDP and APD reflect metabolic inhibition, with selectivity for the osteoclast resulting from high affinity binding to bone mineral.\r"

We have previously reported reduced insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity associated with reduced fasting glycogen synthase phosphatase activity in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant Pima Indians. In this study we investigated the time course for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase and synthase phosphatase during a 2-h high-dose insulin infusion (600 mU/min per m2) in six insulin-sensitive caucasians (group S) and in five insulin-resistant Pima Indians (group R). Percutaneous muscle biopsies were obtained from the quadriceps femoris muscle after insulin infusion for 0, 10, 20, 40, and 120 min. In group S, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity increased with time and was significantly higher than in group R. In group S, synthase phosphatase activity increased significantly by 25% at 10 min and then decreased gradually. No significant change in synthase phosphatase was seen in group R and activity was lower than group S at 0 to 20 min. These data suggest that a low basal synthase phosphatase activity and a defect in its response to insulin explain, at least in part, reduced insulin stimulation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase associated with insulin resistance.\r"

Proton fluxes were determined from the initial rate of change of intracellular pH after a change in the luminal or bathing solution, buffer capacity, and tubular volume of newborn and adult tubules. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured fluorometrically using the pH-sensitive dye (2',7')-bis (carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Apical Na+/H+ antiporter proton flux, assayed by the effect of sodium removal (147----0 meq/liter) on pHi, was one-third the adult level for the first 2 wk and doubled in the 3rd wk of life. Adult levels were achieved by 6 wk of age. Na+/H+ antiporter activity was not detected on the basolateral membrane of 1-wk-old newborns, indicating that polarity of this transporter was already present. Basolateral membrane Na(HCO3)3 proton flux, assayed by the effect of a bath bicarbonate change (25----5 meq/liter) and by a bath sodium change (147----0 meq/liter) on pHi, was 50-60% of adult values in 1-wk-old newborns. Basolateral membrane Na(HCO3)3 proton flux assayed by a bath bicarbonate change (25----5 meq/liter) remained at 50-60% of adult values for the 1st mo of life and increased to adult levels by 6 wk of age. This transporter not only plays a role in net acidification, but is an important determinant of cell pH in newborn juxtamedullary proximal convoluted tubules.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether reduced rates of oxidative (Gox) and non-oxidative (Nox) glucose metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are due to reduced glucose uptake, intrinsic defects in intracellular glucose metabolism or increased fat oxidation (Fox), indirect calorimetry was performed at similar glucose uptake rates in eight nonobese NIDDM and eight comparable nondiabetic subjects. Three glucose clamp studies were performed: one in the nondiabetic and two in the NIDDM subjects. In the nondiabetic subjects, glucose uptake was increased to 7.62 +/- 0.62 mg/kg of fat-free mass (FFM) per min by increasing serum insulin to 309 pmol/liter at a glucose concentration of 5.1 mmol/liter. By raising the concentration of either serum glucose or insulin fourfold in the NIDDM subjects, glucose uptake was matched to nondiabetic subjects (8.62 +/- 0.49 and 8.59 +/- 0.51 mg/kg FFM per min, respectively, P = NS). Skeletal muscle glycogen synthase activity and plasma lactate levels were measured to characterize Nox. When glucose uptake was matched to nondiabetics by hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia, Gox was reduced by 26-28% in NIDDM (P less than 0.025) whereas Fox was similar. Nox was greater in NIDDM (P less than 0.01) and was accompanied by increases in circulating lactate levels. Glycogen synthase activity was reduced by 41% (P less than 0.025) when glucose uptake was matched by hyperglycemia. Glycogen synthase activity was normalized in NIDDM, however, when glucose uptake was matched by hyperinsulinemia. Therefore, a defect in Gox exists in nonobese NIDDM subjects which cannot be overcome by increasing glucose uptake or insulin. Since both glucose uptake and Fox were similar in the two subject groups these factors were not responsible for reduced Gox. Increased Nox in NIDDM is primarily into lactate. Reduced glycogen synthase activity in NIDDM is independent of glucose uptake but can be overcome by increasing the insulin concentration.\r"

  ".U": "90131126\r", 
  ".W": "The importance of oxidative cytocidal mechanisms of phagocytic cells in immune protection against microbial pathogens is uniquely revealed by chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a genetic deficiency disease of man. This cytocidal response in mononuclear phagocytes is principally regulated by IFN-gamma. A somatic cell genetic approach was taken to select oxidative variants from a cloned murine macrophage cell line, J774.16, which formally permitted us to dissociate three regulatory effects of IFN-gamma on these cells: the antiproliferative effect, the antiviral effect, and production of superoxide anion. Half of the variants defective in O-2 production after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation were also resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-gamma. This result suggests that IFN-gamma-induced growth inhibition and production of cytocidal oxygen intermediates are mediated via a common pathway. The somatic cell genetic approach has allowed us to develop in vitro macrophage models for several forms of CGD. One variant characterized in detail, D9, was unable to produce superoxide after stimulation by phorbol esters. At the molecular level, Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNA encoding the large subunit of the putative CGD gene product, cytochrome b558, was absent in this variant. Another class of variants constitutively unable to produce O-2 or the cytochrome b558 mRNA could be induced to do so by IFN-gamma. These somatic mutants may be useful models in clarifying the role of the CGD gene product and its regulation in the production of cytocidal oxygen intermediates.\r"

Measurements of CBF were determined by the radionuclide microsphere technique in rabbits with experimental Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with simultaneous ICP monitoring via an implanted epidural catheter. CBF and ICP measurements were determined at baseline and when mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was artificially manipulated by either pharmacologic or mechanical means. CBF was pressure passive with MABP through a range of 30-120 torr, and ICP directly correlated with CBF. These findings indicate that autoregulation of the cerebral circulation is lost during bacterial meningitis, resulting in a critical dependency of cerebral perfusion on systemic blood pressure, and that the parallel changes in ICP and in CBF suggest that fluctuations in CBF may influence intracranial hypertension in this disease.\r"

Endothelin was detected in the incubating medium of unstimulated pig aortae with, but not in those without endothelium. In preparations with endothelium, thrombin (2-6 U/ml) and the calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-6) M) stimulated the release of the peptide. The basal and thrombin-stimulated production of endothelin were prevented by the protein synthetase inhibitor cycloheximide (10(-6) M). The production of endothelin upon stimulation with thrombin (4 U/ml) was potentiated by L-NG-monomethyl arginine and methylene blue and reduced by superoxide dismutase and 8-bromo cyclic guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP), while the basal release of the peptide was unaffected. Thus, (a) endothelin is released from the intimal layer of intact blood vessels, both under basal conditions and after stimulation with thrombin and the calcium ionophore A23187, and (b) endothelium-derived nitric oxide released during stimulation with thrombin inhibits the production of the peptide via a cyclic GMP-dependent pathway.\r"

Whereas induction of these mRNAs was either absent, or relatively weak and transient, to either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha alone, when administered in combination there was a dramatic increase and persistence in the induction of all three genes. Pretreatment of the keratinocytes with cycloheximide failed to eliminate transcription, implying that all three are primary response genes. Transforming growth factor-beta, which modulates other keratinocyte functions (not related to adhesion or chemotaxis of inflammatory cells) failed to induce any of the genes. These novel findings potentially explain the selective recruitment of T cells and monocytes observed in inflammatory skin disease, because IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha can co-ordinately regulate keratinocyte-derived chemoattractants and adhesion molecule production.\r"

Subjects who died had lower systolic blood pressure, poorer intake of protein calories, lower concentrations of haemoglobin, plasma retinol, zinc, total cholesterol, and higher albumin adjusted plasma calcium concentrations. Stepwise regression analysis identified five variables that predicted mortality: plasma fructosamine; transferrin; glycosylated haemoglobin; prealbumin; and haemoglobin. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the discriminant function score using 0 as the demarcation between survivors and non-survivors were 75%, 97%, and 95%, respectively.

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) tension (PCO2) in both mixed venous and coronary vein blood early in the course of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Because increased PCO2 in the myocardium correlates with both ischemic injury and depression of contractile function, the effects of hypertonic solutions of either the CO2-\"generating\" sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) buffer, a mixture of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (carbicarb) acting as a CO2-\"consuming\" buffer, or saline placebo (NaCl) were compared during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 25 healthy minipigs. Both buffer agents significantly increased the pH and HCO3- of arterial, mixed venous and coronary vein blood. Bicarbonate increased whereas carbicarb reduced blood PCO2 in the systemic circuit as anticipated. However, neither the PCO2 nor the lactate content of coronary vein blood was favorably altered by buffer therapy. Four of eight animals treated with bicarbonate, five of eight treated with carbicarb and six of nine placebo-treated animals were successfully resuscitated and had a comparable 24 h survival rate. Coronary perfusion pressure during precordial compression, a critical determinant of resuscitability, was transiently decreased by each of the hypertonic solutions. Accordingly, neither CO2-generating nor CO2-consuming buffers mitigated increases in coronary vein PCO2 or improved the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation under these experimental conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from normodense human eosinophils (EOSs), stimulated with unopsonized zymosan or calcium ionophore A23187, has been studied. There was a zymosan time- and dose-dependent increase in both PAF and LTC4 production. A plateau of 0.11 +/- 0.04 ng of PAF per 10(6) EOSs (mean +/- SEM; n = 7) and of 1.38 +/- 0.58 ng of LTC4 per 10(6) EOSs (n = 5) was reached at 5 x 10(8) zymosan particles at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes. Under optimal conditions, 91 +/- 1% of the PAF and 66 +/- 13% of the LTC4 remained cell associated. Calcium ionophore A23187 induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in the quantities of PAF and of LTC4 generated by EOSs. A plateau of 31 +/- 13 ng of LTC4 per 10(6) EOSs (n = 5) was reached at 1 mumol/L of calcium ionophore A23187 at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes. The dose response for PAF generation reached 4.2 +/- 0.8 ng/10(6) EOSs (n = 8) at 10 mumols/L of calcium ionophore A23187 at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes and had not plateaued; 90 +/- 5% of the generated PAF was cell associated. In vitro preincubation of EOSs with 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L of nedocromil sodium for 15 minutes did not change the subsequent generation or cellular distribution of PAF or LTC4 in EOSs optimally stimulated with either zymosan or calcium ionophore A23187.\r"

Concomitant therapy with separate MDI doses of cromolyn sodium and a beta-agonist is common practice. If two puffs from each drug could be placed into a chamber, the patient could administer both medications at once, enhancing compliance. A multistage liquid impinger (a four-stage inertial impaction device incorporating an inlet bend and an absolute filter, which separates an aerosol cloud into six fractions) was used to investigate such a possibility. Cromolyn sodium and albuterol MDIs were used with an Aerochamber (Monaghan Medical Corp., Plattsburgh, N.Y.) and an Inspirease (Schering Corp., Kenilworth, N.J.). Results are reported by analyzing milligrams of cromolyn sodium per actuation retrieved. With the Aerochamber, two puffs of cromolyn sodium followed by two puffs of albuterol resulted in the total \"dose to patient\" being reduced by 75% (0.19 versus 0.05 mg) and the effective dose of fine particles (less than 6.5 microns) being reduced by 80% (0.13 versus 0.03 mg) compared to two puffs of cromolyn sodium alone. With the Inspirease, total dose was decreased by 80% (0.32 versus 0.06 mg), whereas the effective dose of fine particles was reduced by 60% (0.19 versus 0.05 mg) compared to one puff of cromolyn sodium alone. The use of cromolyn sodium and albuterol MDIs in a multipuff combination with the Aerochamber or the Inspirease is not recommended because this leads to a loss of the dose delivered compared to a single administration.\r"

Given that persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are a substantial proportion of those needing long-term care, support for research to cure or control these problems should be part of a strategy for addressing the problem of long-term care. However, even if substantial progress is made there is still a need for revising our method of financing long-term care. However, other pressing societal needs, such as reducing the 2 trillion dollar federal debt, addressing the needs of the growing number of children in poverty, and caring for the more than 30 million uninsured Americans, limit the role of the federal government in financing long-term care. A proposal to provide coverage for those with functional disabilities or cognitive impairment who need chronic home care and for the initial portion of nursing home stays within a social insurance program is outlined. More extensive coverage for nursing home stays would be provided for those with community-dwelling spouses. Major financing would be provided through either a payroll tax or by a federal income tax for all age groups with supplementation from estate taxes or capital gains taxes at death. Improvement of benefits in the Medicaid program and an important role for private insurance in protecting the estates of those who become permanent nursing home residents are also suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Benzoyl peroxide (BPO), a free radical generating compound, is widely used in topical medications prescribed for acne vulgaris and in cosmetic products. It has been shown to possess tumor-promoting activity in murine skin initiated with chemical carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). In the present study we assessed the effect of the antioxidants nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and diallyl sulfide (DAS) against BPO-mediated tumor promotion in murine skin. Pretreatment of Sencar mice with NDGA and DAS prior to skin application of BPO resulted in a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of epidermal ODC induction caused by BPO. Tumor initiation was achieved by a single topical application of DMBA (10 micrograms/animal) to Sencar mice. Ten days later tumor promotion was begun by twice-weekly topical application of BPO (20 mg/animal). The anticarcinogenic effects of NDGA (25 mumol/mouse) and DAS (20 mumol/mouse) were evaluated by administering these agents topically 60 min prior to each BPO application. After 26 weeks on test, the number of benign papillomas/mouse were 0.10 +/- 0.07 and 2.15 +/- 0.30 in the NDGA and DAS pretreated group of animals as compared to 4.40 +/- 1.14 in animals receiving BPO alone. After 51 weeks on test, the number of squamous cell carcinomas/mouse were 0.00 +/- 0.00, 0.35 +/- 0.10 in the NDGA and DAS pretreated group of animals as compared to 0.65 +/- 0.12 in animals receiving BPO alone. From these data we suggest that the antioxidants NDGA and DAS can abrogate the tumor-promoting effects of BPO in murine skin and that NDGA is substantially more effective than DAS in this regard.\r"

The immunoreactive proteins from cow and dog could be purified using a procedure developed for human involucrin. The reaction with the purified dog protein could be blocked by purified human involucrin. The results suggest that involucrin-like proteins have a wider species distribution than originally appreciated.\r"

  ".U": "90131842\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently described a process leading to a unipolar cell shedding from pieces of plantar stratum corneum incubated in vitro, which seems to be dependent on the activity of a serine proteinase. This process has been studied further. Electron microscopy studies suggest that cell dissociation is preceded by a degradation of the intercellular parts of desmosomes. An antiserum was raised against the transmembrane protein desmoglein I (DG I) of bovine desmosomes. In extracts of layers of plantar stratum corneum with strong intercellular cohesion, this antiserum reacted with a protein of the same apparent molecular weight as bovine DG I. In dissociated cells this DG I-like protein could not be detected; instead components with molecular weights lower than DG I which reacted with the antiserum were found. During incubation of pieces of plantar stratum corneum, under conditions leading to unipolar cell shedding, there was a progressive decrease in the amounts of the DG I-like protein, and the appearance of the lower molecular weight components with DG I-like immunoreactivity. This apparent degradation of the DG I-like protein was inhibited by aprotinin, chymostatin, and zinc ion, but not by leupeptin. The results suggest that proteolytic degradation of desmosomes may be an important part of the process leading to cell dissociation in plantar stratum corneum in vitro, and that desmosomes may play an important role in plantar stratum corneum cell cohesion.\r"

All five of the known astrovirus serotypes could be detected in 16 samples on which serotyping was done. In tests on 155 stools containing other enteric viruses, including adenoviruses, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, and Norwalk virus (30, 20, 70, 24, 4, and 7 samples, respectively), only 3 were positive in the astrovirus ELISA. The combined specificity for all astrovirus immune electron microscopy-negative samples was 98% (206/211).

Therefore, recent clinical isolates were studied for penicillin tolerance by using a disk diffusion screening test and a pour plate assay. Macrobroth dilution minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations and antibiotic kill kinetics were determined for 4 isolates. Tolerance was present in 38 of 40 clinical isolates with the disk diffusion assay. With the pour plate assay all 40 isolates were tolerant, 34 of them highly tolerant. The presence of the tolerant phenotype was confirmed by macrobroth dilution assays. It is concluded that A. haemolyticum is often penicillin-tolerant, suggesting that phenoxymethylpenicillin administration would be ineffective in eradicating A. haemolyticum from the pharynx.\r"

The prevalence of tuberculin reactivity in visitors and other patients on two floors also showed a strong association with exposure to the patient. A high concentration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the abscessed tissue, disturbance of the surface of liquid drainage from the abscess by irrigations and by the agitated behavior of the patient, and positive air pressure in the patient's room are factors that appear to have contributed to the high risk of tuberculosis transmission.\r"

The mature protein has two domains; one contains an H.8 epitope and the other has extensive homology to azurins, a class of bacterial copper-binding proteins. The cellular location of Laz and the serum immune response to Lax were examined in patients with disseminated Neisseria infections. The data demonstrated that Laz is probably contained in the Neisseria outer membrane, although unlike most outer membrane proteins it is Sarkosyl soluble. By probing recombinant bacteriophages encoding the H.8 and azurin domains of Laz, results showed that whereas the H.8 epitope is immunogenic in patients with disseminated Neisseria infections, the azurin domain of Laz plays little role in eliciting an antibody response in these patients.\r"

Reduced phosphorylation of a 31 kd polypeptide was also observed. The phosphorylation defect in this patient differs from that seen in another patient in whom impaired P47 and myosin light chain phosphorylation was observed but whose functional defect may be more closely related to secretion. The results provide further evidence that phosphorylation of P47 may play a role in platelet activation mechanisms preceding secretion and that abnormalities of phosphorylation of both P47 and myosin light chain may be associated with platelet functional defects in some patients with bleeding disorders.\r"

Serial blood samples (n = 201) were obtained from 47 prospectively identified patients. Each patient's condition was classified daily within four categories: post-traumatic (n = 22) or septic (n = 28) organ failure, transition state (n = 119), and stable organ function after recovery (n = 27). Thirty-two parameters of neutrophil function were automatically calculated for each blood sample from several flow cytometric list mode measurements of cell samples vitally stained with acridine orange for intact and denatured DNA or with 1,4-diacetoxy-2,3-dicyanobenzene for intracellular pH and esterase activity. The DNA of dead cells was simultaneously counterstained with propidium iodide. The cell biochemical parameter pattern was significantly different among samples of patients from the four clinical categories (p less than 0.05). Hyperergic phagocytosis was observed after trauma, in contrast to hypoergic phagocytosis, increased neutrophil cell volume, and elevated intracellular pH during sepsis. The clinical categories were correctly identified in 82% of the samples by automated classification with the DIAGNOS1/SPSS program system from the flow cytometrically determined cell functions. The course of the disease was correctly predicted 3 days in advance to the clinical manifestation of pulmonary or cardiovascular organ failure in 92% of the samples. The multifunctional analysis of neutrophils by flow cytometry seems of interest for early medical intervention in preseptic and preshock patients.\r"

Epitope-bearing RBC membrane polypeptides were identified after autoantibody immunoprecipitation of labeled membranes and immunoblotting. Immunoaffinity isolation of labeled membrane proteins with 12 different IgG hemolytic autoantibodies with protein A-agarose revealed a major polypeptide at Mr 95 to 110 kd, which coelectrophoresed on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a membrane component isolated with sheep IgG anti-band 3. Immunoprecipitation studies with chymotrypsinized RBCs resulted in the recovery of two labeled membrane polypeptides with molecular weights characteristically resulting from the chymotryptic fragmentation of band 3. Immunoblotting with sheep IgG anti-band 3 of the immunoprecipitated polypeptides confirmed that hemolytic autoantibody binding led to recovery of band 3 or its fragments. Two 125I-labeled IgG hemolytic autoantibodies showed binding behavior consistent with epitope localization on band 3. The labeled RBC autoantibodies bound immunospecifically to all types of human RBC tested, including those of rare Rh type (Rh-null, D--) at a site density of approximately 10(6) per RBC. The 125I-IgG in two labeled autoantibodies was 84% and 92% adsorbable by human and higher nonhuman primate RBCs. Antigen-negative animal RBC bound less than 10% (dog, 2.6%; rhesus monkey, 7.4%), consistent with immunospecific RBC binding. IgG-1 was the major subclass in five autoantibodies tested; one of six fixed complement; and autoantibody IgG appeared polyclonal by isoelectric focusing. We conclude that IgG eluted from RBCs of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia consists predominantly of a single totally RBC-adsorbable antibody population that binds to antigenic determinants on band 3. Unlike RBC autoantibodies from antiglobulin-positive normal blood donors, autoantibodies from patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia did not show Rh-dependent properties as judged by antigen site density, absence of differential binding to RBC of different Rh phenotypes, failure to immunoprecipitate 30 kd Rh-epitope bearing membrane polypeptides, absence of multiple antibody populations, and the lack of a significant nonadsorbable IgG population that has been associated with the presence of antiidiotypic IgG. The absence of antiidiotypic IgG in hemolytic autoantibodies may be a contributory factor in the development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\r"

No difference was found between the two blood withdrawal techniques on the basis of the affected measurements. EDTA appeared to be the best anticoagulant with regard to blood cell preservation and showed the lowest whole blood viscosity over a wide range of shear rates (0.1 to 87.0 sec-1). PPACK was the most potent inhibitor of clotting activity as monitored by fibrinopeptide A concentration. The results suggest that EDTA is probably a reasonable choice for rheologic studies of whole blood and should be combined with PPACK when plasma properties are studied.\r"

Very low levels of PAP-I were present in plasma of normal volunteers (0 to 5 ng/ml) and in randomly chosen plasma specimens from hospitalized patients (0 to 28 ng/ml). Review of selected hospital records did not reveal any single clinical entity that correlated with plasma levels. PAP-I was also found in amniotic fluid (12 to 107 ng/ml) and in conditioned medium of cultured endothelial cells (49 +/- 20 ng/ml). Gel filtration experiments showed that PAP-I was intact and uncomplexed in plasma and amniotic fluid. The protein was fairly abundant intracellularly: 4080 +/- 2560 ng/mg total protein in cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells; 178 +/- 109 ng/mg in platelets; 564 +/- 384 ng/mg in leukocytes; and 8.4 +/- 4.3 ng/mg in erythrocytes. The levels of PAP-I increased in platelet-rich plasma after stimulation of platelets with arachidonic acid but not after stimulation with ADP, epinephrine, thrombin, ristocetin, or collagen. These data suggest that PAP-I probably does not function as a circulating natural anticoagulant in normal persons.\r"

Fecal recovery of 14C and 14CO2 excretion were measured over a 3-day period. A mean of only 57% +/- 6% of the dose of [14C(U)]oleate was recovered as 14C in fecal lipid. About 8% was recovered in the aqueous phase of feces and 4% was recovered as 14CO2. Occlusion of the terminal ileum did not diminish 14CO2 excretion, excluding ileal reflux with small bowel absorption. Studies in two germ-free rats showed no conversion of [14C(U)]oleate to fecal water-soluble compounds, indicating that [14C]oleate is converted into water-soluble compounds by bacterial metabolism. The metabolism of [14C]oleate to 14CO2 was also observed in germ-free rats, indicating oxidation in the colon or other host tissues. We conclude that the colonic absorption of lipid or lipid metabolites plus conversion to water-soluble fecal compounds or volatile metabolites results in a fecal fat measurement that appreciably overestimates small bowel absorption of lipid.\r"

There were no significant differences between the effects of genuine and sham acupuncture either on exercise test variables or on subjective variables. In patients receiving genuine acupuncture there was a significant increase in exercise tolerance (median 9%) and in delay of onset to pain (median 10%). No significant changes were observed in patients receiving sham acupuncture. Within both groups there was a median reduction of 50% in anginal attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption, and there was no significant difference between the results achieved in the two groups. It is concluded that with the present design it was not possible to demonstrate any significant differences between the effect of genuine and sham acupuncture.\r"

Heparinization (1 U/ml) of blood prior to thrombus formation by (i) strongly inhibited spontaneous dislodgement (P less than 0.0001). Heparin (1 U/ml), when added with streptokinase (SK) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) prior to thrombus formation, considerably delayed thrombolysis. Furthermore, thrombolysis occurred much earlier when thrombi were perfused with SK or rt-PA in native than in heparinized blood. Heparin inhibited binding of 125I-rt-PA (17%, P less than 0.02) and plasminogen (88%, P less than 0.0005) to platelets activated by ADP in citrated platelet-rich plasma. We conclude that heparin interferes with the fibrinolytic system at the surface of activated platelets.

Compared to placebo, pravastatin therapy reduced levels of cholesterol in total plasma. LDL, VLDL, and IDL cholesterol by 25%, 29%, 31%, and 47%, respectively. Pravastatin treatment also significantly decreased concentrations of apo B in LDL, IDL, and VLDL. The drug significantly reduced the mean production rate for VLDL apo B by 40%, and decreased production rates for LDL apo B in eight of 10 patients. In contrast, fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) were not altered significantly in any of the three lipoprotein fractions on pravastatin therapy. Further, pravastatin produced no consistent changes in LDL particle size, composition, or LDL subclass pattern. Thus pravastatin seemingly reduced input rates for all apo B-containing lipoproteins. Consistent with previous studies, this response was most likely the result of enhanced removal of nascent lipoproteins by increased activity of LDL receptors, although decreased synthesis of apo B in the liver is a possible second action.\r"

Subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. No early onset migraine was observed. Thus the migraine-inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis.

The four subtypes of SP (diffuse plaques, compact plaques, perivascular plaques, and subpial fibrillar deposits) that were observed with the modified Bielschowsky stain were also stained with antibodies to beta ASP. Many cerebellar SP contained ubiquitin-positive granular elements resembling dystrophic neurites. In contrast to neuritic elements in cerebral SP in AD, ubiquitin-positive elements in cerebellar SP were not labeled with antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilament or tau proteins. Various degrees of glial reaction were observed in all subtypes of SP except diffuse plaques. The absence of phosphorylated neurofilament and tau epitopes in neuritic elements in cerebellar SP is not surprising since paired helical filaments have not been seen in the cerebellum. Nevertheless, our results suggest that cerebellar SP are frequently associated with dystrophic neurites.\r"

We found CaM kinase II immunoreactivity concentrated in human hippocampal pyramidal neurons of CA1 and the subiculum. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) staining intensity of CA1 and subicular neurons is strikingly increased despite NFT formation and neuronal depletion.

In addition, the study was designed to assess the impact of maintenance chemotherapy following a complete response (CR) on the time to progression and survival. The response rates (CR plus partial response [PR]) for CAV-HEM and CAV were 64% and 61%, respectively, but 23% of the patients on CAV-HEM achieved a CR compared with 16% for CAV alone (P = .03). Among complete responders, the continuation of therapy significantly increased the remission time for patients on CAV, while maintenance therapy for patients on CAV-HEM had no significant impact on remission time. However, the increased remission had little effect on survival. Patients on CAV maintenance therapy survived marginally longer than those patients on no maintenance therapy, whereas patients who received CAV-HEM and no maintenance therapy survived longer than those on maintenance therapy. CAV-HEM was associated with significantly higher severity of complications (ie, mainly myelosuppression) than CAV (P = .01). Maintenance chemotherapy was associated with significantly more complications than no maintenance therapy. Patients on CAV-HEM lived significantly longer than those on CAV alone (45.9 weeks v 42.7 weeks; P = .002). Ten percent of patients treated on CAV-HEM survived at least 2 years, compared with 4% on CAV alone. In our study involving patients with extensive-disease SCLC, the alternating induction chemotherapy significantly increased the CR rates and had a small impact on long-term survival compared with the results achieved with standard induction chemotherapy. Moreover, when the alternating induction chemotherapy was used, long-term maintenance chemotherapy was not needed.\r"

DESIGN: 1) A retrospective chart review to determine sensitivity and specificity of T4 in diagnosing hypothyroidism; a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ordering an initial T4 test alone, an initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test alone, and T4 and TSH tests together in diagnosing hypothyroidism; a sensitivity analysis was performed on critical assumptions. SETTING: Primary care adult practice of a health maintenance organization. PATIENTS: Eight hundred sixteen consecutive patients suspected of having hypothyroidism who had both T4 and TSH tests performed. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: The sensitivity of a T4 cut-off of 7 micrograms/dl (90.3 nmol/L) in diagnosing primary hypothyroidism was 93% (95% confidence interval = 85-100%) and the specificity was 68% (95% confidence interval = 65-71%). The cost-effectiveness ratios of using an initial T4 or TSH test were about the same across a wide range of test characteristics and disease prevalence estimates. As the ratio of T4 to TSH test charges declines from 0.6 to 0.2, the marginal cost of the TSH-first method increases from $3,500 to $18,000 for each additional hypothyroid patient identified. Ordering both tests together was very costly compared with the single test methods ($125,000 for each additional case diagnosed) and remained so under a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: When hypothyroidism is suspected, a TSH-first testing approach is generally preferable due to its greater sensitivity and, under most assumptions, only small increment in average or marginal cost per case compared with a T4-first method.\r"

Size-independent measures of exercise (e.g., the ratio of oxygen uptake (VO2) to work rate during progressive exercise and the temporal response of VO2, carbon dioxide output (VCO2), and minute ventilation (VE) at the onset of exercise) were used. The ability to perform external mechanical work was corrected for VO2 at unloaded pedaling (change in maximum oxygen uptake (delta VO2max) and in anaerobic threshold (delta AT). On average, obese children's responses were in the normal range: delta VO2max, 104 +/- 41% (+/- SD) predicted (by age); delta AT, 85 +/- 51%; ratio of change in VE to change in VCO2, 111 +/- 21% and ratio of change in VO2 to change in work rate, 100 +/- 24%, but six of the obese children had values of delta VO2max or delta AT that were more than 2 SD below normal. In addition, obese children did not have increased delta VO2max or delta AT with age as observed in nonobese children. Although the response time of VO2 was normal (99 +/- 32% of predicted), those for both VCO2 and VE were prolonged. We conclude that the finding of obesity in a child is not a reliable indicator of poor fitness but that testing cardiorespiratory responses to exercise can be used to identify subjects with serious impairment and to individualize therapy.\r"

Ten healthy full-term infants ranging in age from 1 to 18 weeks and fed with formula provided normal values (group C). Significantly lower mean plasma taurine values (range 1.59 to 3.43 mumol/dl) were found between postnatal weeks 3 and 7 in group P compared with group E (range 5.54 to 6.97 mumol/dl) and with group C (5.6 +/- 0.34 mumol/dl). After initiation of feeding, plasma taurine concentrations in group P increased to normal. Markedly elevated values of mean fractional excretion of taurine, 38% to 56%, were found between weeks 3 and 5 in group P and E compared with group C (15.5 +/- 3.2%). In contrast, during the same period, low urinary taurine values (4.9% to 6.7%) were found in two larger, older infants receiving total parenteral nutrition whose plasma taurine values were in the normal range. After week 5, urinary taurine values were in the control range in all groups. We conclude that the absence of taurine in total parenteral nutrition solutions administered to very low birth weight infants and the limited ability of the immature kidney to adapt to low taurine intake by \"up-regulation\" of tubular taurine reabsorption may result in depleted taurine body pools during the first weeks of life. This inability to conserve taurine by the immature nephron could potentially have a deleterious effect on the developing brain and retina in these infants, and indicates a possible need for taurine supplementation.\r"

Respiratory rate, relative tidal volume and respiratory minute volume also increased unrelated to changes in locomotor activity. Higher doses, on the other hand, produced catalepsy and respiratory depression. Pretreatment of the rats with the mu1-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the stimulant locomotor and respiratory effects of low doses of dermorphin (10-100 pmol/kg), but potentiated the respiratory depressant effect of a high dose (10 nmol/kg) of dermorphin. The selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (5 mg/kg), which has been shown previously to antagonize catalepsy and respiratory depression produced by relatively high doses of dermorphin, did not antagonize the respiratory or locomotor stimulant effect of dermorphin. The data suggest that mu1-opioid receptors are responsible for the low dose stimulant effects of dermorphin on locomotor activity and respiration whereas mu2 receptors mediate the respiratory depressant effect of dermorphin.\r"

Repeated administration of arachidonic acid (3 micrograms at 10-min intervals) to the isolated kidney of the rat, perfused in situ with Krebs-Henseleit solution, led to the development of tachyphylaxis to the renal vasoconstrictor effects of arachidonic acid, using perfusion pressure changes as an index. Vasoconstrictor responses to either angiotensin or the endoperoxide analog, U46619, were unaffected by repeated administration of arachidonic acid. Associated with progressively reduced renal vasoconstrictor responses to arachidonic acid were parallel decrements in the renal venous release of prostanoids, measured by radioimmunoassay. In contrast, the release of prostanoids from the kidney stimulated by angiotensin II was increased after repeated administrations of arachidonic acid. These data suggest that the sequential reduction in renal vasoconstrictor responses to arachidonic acid is due to diminished conversion to prostaglandins, possibly due to inactivation of cyclooxygenase, decreased entry of arachidonic acid into the cell or its increased esterification into phospholipids.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) did not alter the basal perfusion pressure in the isolated rat mesenteric arteries perfused with Krebs' solution, but produced a biphasic effect in arteries preconstricted with norepinephrine or arginine vasopressin: constriction, then prolonged dilation. Both these components of PGI2 effect were diminished in arteries denuded of their endothelia by a 10 min perfusion with distilled water or p-bromophenacyl bromide (10 microM). The present study elucidates the mechanism of these PGI2 actions. Indomethacin (0.28 microM) SQ 29548 (1 microM, thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist), saralasin (1 microM, angiotensin II receptor antagonist) or the free radical scavengers, superoxide dismutase (60 U/ml) and catalase (40 U/ml) did not inhibit the initial vasoconstriction, suggesting it was not mediated through endothelially generated thromboxane A2, angiotensin II or oxygen-derived free radicals. However, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (50 microM; Ca++ chelating agent), 8-(diethyl-amino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzoate (10 microM; intracellular Ca++ antagonist), or neomycin (5 mM; phospholipase-C inhibitor) abolished the vasoconstriction. Ouabain (0.5 mM) did not affect the vasodilation, but perfusion with excess (50 mM) or 0 K+ Krebs' solution abolished it, suggesting this PGI2 action involves changes in membrane K+ conductance via a mechanism independent of Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase. Vasodilation evoked by BRL 34915 (K+ channel activator) was similarly attenuated under these conditions, but not by ouabain. Furthermore, procaine (1 mM; nonspecific K+ channel inhibitor), but not apamin (0.5 microM) or tetraethylammonium (10 mM) blocked PGI2- and BRL 34915-induced vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, the present study sought to investigate whether smooth muscle contractions and/or endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and other agonists were sensitive to PTX. In endothelium-denuded rabbit pulmonary artery rings, ACh, clonidine and serotonin produced concentration-dependent contractions which were markedly inhibited in nominally Ca+(+)-free medium and abolished in the presence of ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (0.2 mM). In endothelium-denuded arterial rings obtained from rabbits treated in vivo with PTX (5 micrograms/kg i.v., 5 days before sacrifice) maximum contractions to ACh, clonidine and serotonin were inhibited by 77, 67 and 35%, respectively. Contractions induced with KCl (10-40 mM) were also abolished in Ca+(+)-free medium, but they were not affected by PTX. Endothelium-dependent relaxations of phenylephrine-contracted pulmonary arteries in response to ACh adenosine triphosphate and substance P were also reduced or abolished upon removal of extracellular Ca++. However, the endothelium-dependent relaxations were not affected by PTX. These data demonstrate that contractions of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells after stimulation through muscarinic receptors, alpha adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors require the influx of extracellular Ca++. This receptor-stimulated Ca++ influx is likely to be regulated by a PTX-sensitive G protein. Also, the induction of release of relaxing factor from endothelial cells of the pulmonary artery via muscarinic, purinergic or substance P receptors requires extracellular Ca++. However, in these cells, a different mode of signal transduction, insensitive to PTX, seems to be involved.\r"

Each drug tested was administered i.a. Graded doses of gabexate (1-10 mg) elicited dose-dependent biphasic responses for the secretory rates, bicarbonate concentrations and outputs of pancreatic juice, with maximum effects at approximately 5 mg, but had little effect on the protein concentrations. Camostat, at a high dose of 10 mg, caused significant increases in the secretory rate, bicarbonate concentration and output of pancreatic juice over their basal levels, but had little influence on the protein concentration. Secretin (0.03-0.3 U) usually produced similar to gabexate-induced results (1-5 mg). Both bicarbonate and protein concentrations of the juice obtained with gabexate or camostat were almost the same as those obtained with secretin at a similar secretory rate of pancreatic juice, suggesting the secretory action of gabexate or camostat might be similar to that of secretin. In addition, gabexate (3 mg) and camostat (10 mg) elicited more than the respective additive secretory responses in the presence of i.a. infusion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (12 micrograms/min) as well as secretin (0.1 U). These results indicate that gabexate and camostat induce water and bicarbonate secretion by acting directly on ductular cells of the dog pancreas, which might be mediated at least partially through cyclic AMP.\r"

Specific (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding in porcine coronary artery was saturable, reversible and of high affinity (Kd = 0.24 nM) and it showed a pharmacological specificity as well as stereoselectivity which characterized the receptor sites for DHP Ca++ channel antagonists. DHP antagonists competed for the (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding in order: PN 200-110 greater than mepirodipine greater than nisoldipine greater than nicardipine greater than nitrendipine greater than nimodipine greater than nifedipine greater than (-)-PN 200-110.

The potencies (PKi) of these eight DHP Ca++ channel antagonists in competing for (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding sites in porcine coronary artery correlated well with their pharmacological potencies. Specific (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding in the coronary artery was enhanced by d-cis-diltiazem and was inhibited incompletely by verapamil and D-600.

  ".W": "Equine airway smooth muscle is innervated by vagal efferents and, in addition, displays spontaneous mechanical activity. The preparation thus appears to contain at least two discrete excitable components, the cholinergic neural elements and the smooth muscle membrane. Indomethacin (INDO), a cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitor, exerts a considerable potentiation of function in this preparation. The latter may be effected indirectly, through loss of the inhibitory effect of endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on neural acetylcholine release and through direct effects on smooth muscle of the generally antagonistic CO and lipoxygenase (LO) metabolites. The present studies were designed to assess the relative contributions of altered arachidonic acid metabolism on those respective elements. The utility of the model, in terms of distinguishing neural and myogenic components, was assessed by examining the effects of the muscarinic antagonist atropine (ATR) and the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) on the stimulus-response (SR) relationship. The observations that TTX and ATR produced similar rightward (but not downward) shifts of the SR curve and that D-600 inhibited the TTX-insensitive responses are consistent with a selective activation of the muscle by the nerves at lower voltages and a direct stimulation of the muscle at higher voltages. INDO potentiated both the neural and myogenic components of the SR curve, effects which were sensitive to ATR and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, an inhibitor of LO, and reversed by PGE2. The finding that PGE2 at low doses (10(-8) M) inhibited responses at lower voltages and that at higher concentration (10(-7) M) it shifted the SR curve right and downward suggested that neurotransmitter release is more sensitive to PGE2 inhibition than is muscle response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rats with cirrhosis exhibited significantly higher plasma renin activity values when compared with the control group. However, plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin were not significantly different in the two groups. Plasma aldosterone concentrations were significantly higher than those found in the normal control group in approximately 50% of the cirrhotic animals, and were equal to or less than the control values in the rest. This dissociation between plasma renin activity and aldosterone values in some of the cirrhotic animals is interesting and parallels observations made in humans with alcoholic cirrhosis. The results suggest that experimentally induced, apparently compensated cirrhosis may be associated with a perceived decrease in effective circulating volume, and that there is no absolute deficiency of atrial natriuretic peptide in this model of cirrhosis.\r"

Rats were given monocrotaline in drinking water, 20 mg/l, for 4 or more days. Isolated arteries were placed in tissue baths and contracted with norepinephrine or 5-hydroxy-tryptamine under K(+)-free conditions. The arteries relaxed when K+ was \"returned\" to the bath. Compared to arteries from untreated rats, arteries taken from rats pretreated with monocrotaline developed less force in response to contracting agents and did not relax to the same extent. After 4 days treatment with monocrotaline, the rate of relaxation of the arteries in response to K(+)-return was slower than that of arteries taken from untreated rats. Endothelial trauma or in vitro treatment with ouabain produced a similar decrease in the rate of relaxation. Uptake of radiolabeled Rb by perfused arteries was not altered by 4 days of monocrotaline pretreatment. Isolated lungs taken from monocrotaline-pretreated rats (5 days of ingestion of 20 mg/l of monocrotaline drinking water) accumulated similar quantities of 86Rb+ during 40-sec perfusions. Shorter perfusion times, 10 and 20 sec, resulted in greater rates of uptake of 86Rb- by lungs taken from monocrotaline-treated rats. Monocrotaline produced changes in both the mechanical and biochemical properties of pulmonary arteries after only 4 to 5 days. These changes were associated with ouabain-sensitive processes. It appears, therefore, that one of the early targets in monocrotaline intoxication is the Na+/K+ pump of the pulmonary arteries.\r"

The RNA samples from the three patients with undetectable AVP mRNA expressed abundant atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRNA. Analysis of specimens from three patients with small cell lung cancer and normal serum sodium levels revealed no detectable AVP mRNA expression, and samples from only one of these three patients' specimens expressed detectable ANF mRNA. The AVP and ANF peptide levels in lysate preparations of the tumor cell lines from four of these patients were tested by radioimmunoassay and confirmed the gene expression data. These studies demonstrate ectopic production of ANF mRNA in small cell lung cancer specimens from patients with this cancer and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. These findings will be of particular interest if future studies demonstrate that ectopic ANF production can cause sodium abnormalities in patients with small cell lung cancer.\r"

In the past misdiagnosis and delayed treatment led to significant mortality. However, the prognosis currently is better due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, better radiological imaging studies, and earlier diagnosis and treatment.\r"

After replacing segments of the femoral arteries of 15 dogs with autogenous vein in one groin and polytetrafluoroethylene in the contralateral groin, 10(8) colony-forming units of nonmucin-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (five dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five dogs), or sterile saline solution (five dogs) were directly inoculated onto the grafts. The grafts were examined 7 to 10 days after implantation. None of the control dogs exhibited inflammatory signs, and no grafts or anastomoses disrupted. S. epidermidis was unrecoverable from either graft material in any of the animals, although histologic evaluation confirmed neutrophils and bacteria in four of five animals in the vein and polytetrafluoroethylene groups. No dog inoculated with S. epidermidis had graft or anastomotic disruption. By contrast, P. aeruginosa was recovered from both types of grafts in all inoculated animals. Neutrophils, bacteria, and microabscesses were observed in all of these animals. In addition, three of five polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and all five vein grafts disrupted either at the anastomoses or in the body of the vein graft. Therefore S. epidermidis is a less virulent organism that may persist in graft walls despite negative cultures, whereas P. aeruginosa is a highly virulent organism that can disrupt native artery, vein grafts, and anastomoses. The graft material appears to be less important than the bacteria in determining the outcome of infection.\r"

Diagnosis related group payments from each center were used to determine net gain or loss for each patient. Patients were classified as having claudication or critical ischemia (limb salvage). Reimbursements matched costs/charges for the claudication group; overall mean loss in this group was only $915 per patient. However, all centers had important losses in the limb salvage group. Reimbursements averaged 60% of costs/charges, with a mean loss of $8158 per patient and an overall loss for all 10 centers of $3,653,918. An effort to remedy this inequity is progressing via a dialogue between representatives of the Society for Vascular Surgery, the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, and the federal government.\r"

We then examined the 674 most common principal discharge diagnoses and found significant variations by diagnosis code for all three outcomes. We believe that analyses of claims data by diagnosis code can provide useful information to clinicians and their patients regarding the clinical and economic prognosis of specific diseases, help managed-care programs identify patients likely to incur substantial costs over a several-year period, and inform insurers regarding the expected level of resources that will be used following discharge for patients with specific diseases.\r"

Guinea pigs were given 3 X 10(10) CA intragastrically before inflicting a 50% burn to determine if a single enteral feeding could affect CA translocation to the MLN. A bolus infusion (20 kcal/kg, 12 ml in volume) of liquid meal, consisting of 68% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 12% lipid, was administered either at 3-hr or 12-hr postburn. Control groups received no food or a similar amount of saline by bolus infusion. All animals were allowed water ad libitum until 24-hr postburn when their MLN and intestinal segments were harvested for enumeration of viable CA. Blood was also collected for determination of serum IgG, C3, cortisol, and albumin. Compared to nonfeed animals, those with a single enteral feeding at 12-hr postburn had reduced numbers of CA translocating to the MLN (970 +/- 220 vs 7,120 +/- 2,130 CFU/g, p less than 0.02) and colonizing in the ileum (27,000 +/- 6,770 vs 104,000 +/- 23,550 CFU/g, p less than 0.01). Bolus feeding at 12 hr was associated with a lower cortisol level (237 +/- 55% of normal controls) than bolus feeding at 3 hr (310 +/- 58, p less than 0.02) or the nonfed group (326 +/- 66, p less than 0.01). Regardless of dietary treatment, serum cortisol levels correlated positively with the extent to which CA translocated to the MLN and negatively with C3 levels.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamine is an important fuel utilized by the intestinal mucosa that is not present in standard amino acid nutrition solutions. In order to determine the effects of glutamine on the intestine, glutamine enriched nutrition was administered intravenously to male Wistar rats. A standard amino acid solution was enriched with 1 and 2 g/100 ml of glutamine or glycine and used as part of a parenteral nutrition regime for 7 days. Intestinal samples were taken for measurements of jejunal weight, DNA, protein, mucosal thickness and villus height. Animals receiving 2 g glutamine/100 ml in the nutrition solution had increased intestinal weight, DNA, and villus height when compared to animals receiving 2 g/100 ml of glycine. No increase in the intestinal parameters was noted when 1 g/100 ml of glutamine was used. To investigate the dose-response effects of glutamine, further studies were performed using isonitrogenous and isocaloric solutions containing 0, 2, and 3 g of glutamine/100 ml. Animals receiving glutamine had a significant increase in mucosal weight, DNA, protein and villus height when compared to animals receiving no glutamine in the parenteral solutions. There was a dose-response relationship between the increase in jejunal DNA and the increased intake of glutamine (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01) but no correlation with the nitrogen content of the solutions (r = 0.18, p = 0.8). Total body nitrogen retention was greater in animals receiving 2 g/100 ml of glutamine (166 +/- 12 mg, days 6/7) when compared to those receiving 0 and 3 g of glutamine/100 ml (126 +/- 14 mg and 138 +/- 16 mg, respectively, p less than 0.05). These studies demonstrate that glutamine enriched nutrition protects against atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and when given at 2 g/100 ml improves nitrogen retention during intravenous feeding.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of developmental of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-associated cholestatic jaundice in neonates receiving intravenous hyperalimentation is high. Numerous factors have been cited as contributing to TPN cholestasis; however, the exact etiology remains obscure. This retrospective study was undertaken in order to identify any factors which might contribute to this syndrome. The hospital records of 172 neonates requiring TPN for a minimum of 1 week were reviewed. In addition, a subgroup of 32 infants requiring TPN for a minimum of 7 weeks was also examined. Cholestasis was defined as a direct serum bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dl during the course of TPN therapy. Significant factors for the development of cholestasis in both groups (n = 172, n = 32) included: number of operations (2.56 vs. 1.08, p = 0.0000), the number of days the patients received antibiotics (40.3 vs 12.9, p = 0.0000), and delayed start of enteral feedings (33.8 vs 14.1, p = 0.0000). Fifteen of the 32 patients who received TPN for at least 7 weeks did not develop cholestasis. In this subgroup (n = 32), there were no differences in birth weight, gestational age, days from birth to the start of TPN, or respiratory distress between those who developed cholestasis and those who remained anicteric. In contrast, there were significant differences between the cholestasis and noncholestasis groups in number of operations (13 vs 6, p = 0.0407), and days until enteral feedings were started (33.1 vs 18.9, p = 0.0289). This study suggests that the factor(s) contributing to the development of TPN-associated cholestasis are likely multifactorial. There appears to be a direct correlation between increasing severity of cholestatic jaundice and duration of TPN. This review does add a new parameter to the various causative factors suggested, namely the number of operative procedures. This new variable could be related to the stress of surgery itself or to the repeated administration of anesthetic agents.\r"

During the experimental periods the fibrosarcoma grows exponentially when rats are fed chow ad libitum while the colon tumor reaches a plateau of its Gompertzian growth curve. A 12-day regimen of TPN resulted in an increased growth of the colon tumor but not the fibrosarcoma. The erythrocyte putrescine levels of fibrosarcoma-bearing rats and the levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine of Ward colon-tumor-bearing rats were significantly increased by TPN compared with similarly treated nontumor-bearing (NTB) rats. When the growth of the fibrosarcoma was slowed by feeding a restricted intake (RI) regimen, a subsequent 6-day regimen of TPN resulted in increased tumor growth. Erythrocyte polyamine levels of fibrosarcoma-bearing, RI-rats were elevated by TPN repletion. There was a consistent, significant, interaction between TPN and tumor presence on the erythrocyte putrescine levels in fibrosarcoma-bearing rats and the levels of all polyamines in Ward colon-tumor-bearing rats. The effects of TPN on tumor growth and erythrocyte polyamine levels of tumor-bearing rats may be dependent on the growth characteristics of the tumor. The data demonstrate that TPN consistently enhanced the tumor contribution to the erythrocyte putrescine pool.\r"

Thirty patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms who had lost more than 5 kg of weight over 3 months were randomized into three groups to receive preoperatively: (a) no IVN, (b) IVN for 3 days (0.18 gN/kg/day as amino acid; 30 kcal/kg/day as glucose), or (c) IVN for 7 days. Free access to a hospital diet was available to all patients including 10 patients who had not lost weight who served as controls. In the three groups of patients who had lost weight, median transferrin and fibronectin were lower than for controls, whereas other proteins and amino acids were comparable. After feeding, samples of liver were obtained peroperatively and the potential rates of protein synthesis were calculated from the in vitro incorporation of (14C)-leucine, into protein. Preoperative IVN significantly increased the potential rate of protein synthesis in liver after 3 days. Plasma amino acids were comparable with controls whereas in the unfed-group concentrations suggested utilization of alanine and breakdown of muscle. Three days of IVN also increased plasma fibronectin and IgA but increases of prealbumin, IgM, and complement C3 were only significant in the group fed for 7 days. On the 7th postoperative day plasma proteins were decreased similarly in each group. This study shows that concentrations of several plasma proteins, in preoperative patients reflect net rates of hepatic protein synthesis and are susceptible to depletion during starvation and repletion by 3 or 7 days of IVN.\r"

In the present study we examined whether this progressive muscle wasting and reduced functional capacity so damaging to patients with muscular dystrophies, can be reduced or even reversed by nightly overfeeding with 1000 ml of Osmolite in addition to the voluntary daytime dietary intake. In the Duchenne muscle dystrophy (DMD) group (six patients) body weight increased significantly accompanied by a 14% increase in midarm muscle circumference with only minimal changes in triceps skin fold, indicating a relative build up of muscle mass. In the congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) group (four patients) no changes occurred in body weight or any of the three anthropometric measurements performed. Baseline nitrogen balance was mildly positive in both groups and improved significantly in the DMD group during the 3-month experimental period of refeeding, with no changes in urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion, suggesting improved muscle protein synthesis with no change in muscle protein degradation. No changes were detected in hematological and biochemical parameters, liver function tests, pulmonary function tests, or a general activity index during the study period. Our results suggest that a reduced rate of protein synthesis rather than an increased rate of protein degradation occur in muscle dystrophies, and that overfeeding might offer promising nutritional effects, at least in DMD patients.\r"

Luminol enhanced chemiluminescence was followed over 15 min and recorded as peak output (P; mV), integral under the curve (I; V-sec) and rate of increase (R; mV/sec). Eighteen chronically ill patients receiving glucose based total parenteral nutrition were studied before and after a 4- to 6-hr test infusion of 500 ml of 10% fat emulsion. P decreased from 719 +/- 46 to 461 +/- 42 mV (p less than 0.001), I decreased from 169 +/- 17 to 111 +/- 12 V-sec (p less than 0.001) and R decreased from 6.9 +/- 1.0 to 4.0 +/- 0.6 mV/sec (p less than 0.001). Preincubation of normal whole blood with fat emulsion in vitro did not adversely affect chemiluminescence (11 studies), nor did incubation of normal neutrophils with patient postinfusion plasma (10 studies). We conclude that fat emulsion infusion acutely suppresses neutrophil chemiluminescence. The suppression is not a direct effect of the fat emulsion per se and is not due to inhibitory substances in the plasma following infusion.\r"

It is unknown whether this interference occurs in humans with clinically relevant doses of intravenous fat. Two studies were done. Eighteen patients were prospectively enrolled for study. Patients received full feeding by continuous total parenteral nutrition (amino acids 1.5 g/kg/day and dextrose 4.5 g/kg/day) with 33.1 kcal/kg/day. Forty-three % of the nonprotein calories were provided as soybean oil emulsion (Travamulsion 20%) and was administered intravenously over 10 hr (0.130 g/kg/hr). Reticuloendothelial system function was determined by measuring the change in the clearance rate of intravenously injected 99mTc-sulfur colloid (TSC) in each patient. In study 1 (n = 10), one day of lipid (10 hr) was infused, with the clearance of 99mTc-sulfur colloid measured before the lipid was infused and then during the last hour of the 10-hr infusion. In study 2 (n = 8), the clearance rates were measured before the lipid emulsion was begun, and then during the last hour of the infusion on the 3rd day. Clearance rates for TSC after 10 hr of lipid infusion in study 1 did not differ (0.27 +/- 1/min to 0.26 +/- 0.1/min, p greater than 0.10). However, after 3 days of lipid infusion (10 hr/day), a statistically significant reduction in TSC was seen (0.46 +/- 0.08/min-0.27 +/- 0.03/min, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Abnormalities of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and platelet number or function related to Intralipid infusion have been reported although conflicting results exist. In order to examine potential adverse hematologic effects of Intralipid, 10 ill neonates were studied before and after a 16-hr infusion of 1 g/kilo of Intralipid. PMN count, chemokinesis, chemotaxis, and aggregation were unchanged pre- and post intralipid infusion. Platelet count, bleeding time, and platelet aggregation were also unchanged. Similar results were obtained in vitro when neonatal and adult PMNs and platelets were incubated in Intralipid and their function analyzed. These findings suggest that short-term, low-dose Intralipid has no measurable impact on neonatal PMN or platelet activity and support its use in neonates even in the presence of infection or thrombocytopenia.\r"

  ".W": "Nutrition is of critical importance to very low birth weight (VLBW) survival. Intravenous (iv) lipid tolerance has been studied using a soybean or safflower-based lipid emulsion. We studied lipid levels in a group of VLBW infants on both intravenous lipids (soybean-safflower emulsion) and on enteral feedings (24 cal/oz premature formula). Levels were obtained on 1, 2, and 3 g/kg/day of iv lipid and after 3 and 10 days of feeding. Triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) proved the most sensitive indicator of both iv and enteral tolerance. The higher the lipid dose, the more likely there would be elevated lipid levels, especially FFA. Mean lipid levels for the group of enteral-fed infants were normal. Comparison of lipid levels on iv to those on enteral feedings showed significant differences in trough iv levels of TG compared to preprandial TG. FFAs tended to be significantly higher on iv feedings. Monitoring lipid levels on iv and enteral feedings is appropriate to document tolerance.\r"

Of 24 patients on parenteral nutrition for more than 10 days, 12 infants who received oral gentamicin (group I) for prophylaxis against neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis were compared to 12 infants who did not (group II). Both mean and peak direct bilirubin levels were significantly higher in group II. The increase in both mean and peak direct bilirubin levels after initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was significant in group II only. The incidence of cholestasis was significantly higher in group II than in group I.

A study was carried out to characterize the material which is filtered out of the TNA and is a potential cause of catheter blockage. A total of 45 bags containing the same TNA solution were stored for 7 days at 4 degrees C. The stability of the solution in all the bags was then confirmed by light microscope and Coulter Counter, to determine the particle-size distribution, following which the solution was filtered through a 5-microns filter. Chemical analysis was then made to determine the amount of solid particles, fat and precipitates of Mg, Zn, Ca, Na, and K in the filter contents. Each bag was found to contain 7326 +/- 2681 solid particles as plasticizers and the main component of the filter contents was fat (99.4%) whereas electrolytes as precipitates constituted less than 0.5%. The amount of fat and electrolytes lost on the filter from the solution was negligible. Our analysis of the material trapped on the filter, which may block the catheter during long-term therapy, suggests the importance of filtration and of finding a means for dissolving the fat, the main component of the filter material.\r"

Rats were fed a diet high (64%) or low (8%) in protein for three weeks. Renal medullary Na-K-ATPase was 75 +/- 12 U/mg protein/hr (mean +/- SE) in the high protein group and 44 +/- 3 in rats given low protein. After 90 minutes of perfusion, the kidneys of rats fed a high protein diet showed almost all mTAL cells near the inner medulla with severe damage (93 +/- 4.8%), whereas the same zone in perfused kidneys of rats on a low protein diet showed only 47 +/- 7.7% injury. In a similar fashion, damage to mTAL cells seen in perfused kidneys was greatly augmented by compensatory renal hypertrophy produced by removal of the contralateral kidney two weeks earlier, and by a diet high in potassium given for two weeks, procedures which also increased the activity of medullary Na-K-ATPase. The results suggest that the level of transport work of medullary cells mediated by Na-K-ATPase is a determinant of the vulnerability of mTAL cells to hypoxic injury.\r"

These structures consist primarily of types IV and V collagen, which are highly resistant to the action of classical interstitial collagenases. Here we report that an intrinsic glomerular cell type, the human mesangial cell, secretes: 1) a neutral proteinase with specific activity against type IV basement membrane collagen and, 2) an inhibitory protein with the characteristics of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). The purified enzyme has a neutral pH optimum, consists of a basic (pI 8.4) protein doublet with molecular weight of 66 and 68 kilodaltons, and is inhibited by calcium and zinc chelators. The enzyme degrades both soluble and basement membrane type IV collagen, but does not specifically degrade types I or V collagen or casein. Immunohistochemistry of cultured cells demonstrated homogeneous staining for the neutral proteinase antigen, while the TIMP antigen was detected in fewer than one-third of cultured cells. These findings suggest that the synthesis of these proteins may be independently regulated. The secretion of these factors may play an important role in the turnover of the glomerular ECM under basal or pathologic conditions.\r"

Biochemical studies revealed reductase activity to be present in all three regions of the kidney with the highest specific activity observed in the inner medulla, followed by the cortex and the outer medulla. Activity in all three regions was inhibited by the aldose reductase inhibitors sorbinil, tolrestat and 7-hydroxychromone-2-carboxylic acid. Based on substrate utilization and response to sulfate on the inhibitors, the inner medulla contains primarily aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) while the cortex contains primarily aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2). The outer medulla contains a mixture of both enzymes. This distribution was confirmed by a radioimmunoassay for aldose reductase. Immunohistochemical investigations of the rat kidney with antibodies against rat lens aldose reductase and rat kidney aldehyde reductase revealed a similar distribution of these enzymes. Aldehyde reductase was immunohistochemically detected only in the cortex where it was localized in the proximal convoluted tubules. Immunoreactive aldose reductase was detected in Henle's loop at both the inner stripe of the outer medulla and in the inner medulla, and in the collecting tubules and the epithelial cell lining the pelvis of the inner medulla near the papilla. No specific immunohistochemical staining for aldose reductase was observed in the cortex. A similar immunohistochemical distribution of aldose reductase was also observed in the human kidney with antibodies against human placental aldose reductase.\r"

The schistosomal specificity of kidney lesions was assessed by detecting the schistosomal specific antigens (CAA and CCA) and antibodies deposited in the renal glomeruli of these patients. Patients who had another etiologic cause which may explain their kidney disease were not admitted to this study. After initiation of the treatment, patients were followed up every other week in the outpatient clinic for 12 months. Follow-up showed complete remission of proteinuria in two cases in group II (duration of remission was 4 and 8 months) and in one case in group III (duration of remission was 6 months) but in none in group I. Partial remission was observed in one case in group I, in three cases in group II and in one case in group III. During the observation period, improvement in kidney function was observed in two cases in group II but deterioration in kidney function was observed in one case in group I and in one other case in group III. We conclude that in patients with schistosomal nephropathy, none of the tried therapeutic regimens produce regression of the disease if given to patients with established disease.\r"

In 32 normal pregnancies monitored monthly, the highest aldosterone/ANP ratio was observed in the last weeks (28.7 +/- 12), and dropped in the first postpartum week (3.6 +/- 2.8), without changes in fractional excretion of sodium. In 18 preeclamptic patients, the ratio was significantly lower than in normal pregnancy at the same gestational ages, and it was coupled with absolute reduction in the sodium excretion. Among preeclamptic patients, a significant inverse correlation (P less than 0.025) was revealed between the ratio and sodium excretion. Natriuresis in response to acute volume expansion with albumin infusion occurred only in 50% of preeclamptic patients, and was associated with an ANP increase, an aldosterone decrease, and a further decrease in the ratio. A blunted natriuresis was observed in cases with a particularly low prealbumin value of this ratio. Furthermore, in preeclampsia, a particularly low ratio seemed to be typical of the patients who showed poorer placental flows and fetal outcomes. These results suggest that the balance between aldosterone and ANP may be a useful index in understanding sodium homeostasis in these settings.\r"

  ".U": "90134724\r", 
  ".W": "It is now becoming apparent that the medullary circulation in the kidney can be regulated separately from overall renal blood flow. This characteristic of the medullary circulation plays an important role in the kidney's ability to excrete a dilute or concentrated urine in concert with changes in water and sodium transport in the distal nephron secondary to the action of vasopressin, prostaglandins, the renal nerves, and other hormones without significant other renal hemodynamic changes. There is strong evidence that renal autocoids such as angiotensin II and prostaglandins uniquely affect regional blood flow in the inner medulla because of the special structure and organization of the microvasculature in this region. There is also evidence that this regional blood flow is in part regulated by circulating hormones, such as vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide, which are released in response to changes in extracellular fluid volume or osmolality. In addition, data are emerging to suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system, acetylcholine, the renal nerves and adenosine participate in this regulation. In addition to the role of the medullary circulation in the urinary concentrating operation, there are data to suggest that the medullary circulation either directly (by changes in physical forces) or indirectly (by regulating medullary toxicity) may influence sodium excretion in a variety of conditions. In this regard, activation of the renin-angiotensin system locally reduces blood flow in the papilla which may be necessary before sodium retention is fully expressed in salt retaining states. Future research looking at the microvasculature of the medulla and papilla and those factors that control the contractility of these vessels are necessary before a clearer picture emerges. Nevertheless, from the data already available it seems reasonable to suggest that the medullary circulation may be as important to kidney function during physiological and pathophysiological states as is the cortical circulation.\r"

  ".W": "The basic mechanisms of renal growth remain poorly understood. The work hypertrophy theory holds that after an acute reduction in renal mass, the growth of the kidney occurs as a consequence of increased renal function. Pharmacological inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis impairs the acute adaptive increases in both renal function and mass following partial nephrectomy. The present study examines the effects of four weeks of dietary fish oil on renal growth, function and arachidonic acid metabolites in intact and uninephrectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Dietary fish oil interferes with dienoic prostaglandin and thromboxane production in favor of synthesis of trienoic analogues. Control animals were pair-fed an identical diet with the exception that the fat was replaced by beef tallow. Renal cortical concentrations of arachidonic acid metabolites were reduced in animals fed fish oil, and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 was impaired. Fish oil feeding resulted in increased kidney weight without concomitant increases in renal function in intact animals. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were greater in uninephrectomized rats fed fish oil compared to uninephrectomized controls pair-fed beef tallow. Augmentation of the compensatory increases in renal function observed with fish oil feeding was not associated with any additional renal hypertrophy. These data indicate that dietary fish oil has a profound impact on renal growth and function, which may be the consequence of altered renal and/or extrarenal arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, the direction of the alterations in renal mass oppose that of renal function, providing clear and unique evidence against the work hypertrophy theory of renal growth.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral ureteral obstruction results in marked changes in renal function throughout the nephron, including impaired acid and potassium secretion and salt wastage. The nephron site believed responsible for the acidification defect is the collecting duct. It has been presumed, although not demonstrated, that the cellular mechanism for the acidification defect is both a decrease in transepithelial voltage and a decrease in activity of the proton pump located at the luminal membrane. The mechanism for the abnormalities in sodium handling are thought due to alterations in Na-K ATPase activity. Our laboratory has recently mapped the profile of the N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive ATPase and Na-K ATPase in microdissected rat nephron, documenting their presence throughout much of the nephron. In animals with acute unilateral ureteral obstruction for 18 to 24 hours, we measured NEM-sensitive ATPase and Na-K ATPase activities in several nephron sites. In all nephron segments Na-K ATPase activity was markedly decreased. In the medullary collecting duct, NEM-sensitive ATPase activity was also markedly reduced in animals with acute ureteral obstruction; in the cortical collecting duct, activity fell significantly, but to a lesser degree than was observed in the medullary collecting duct. NEM-sensitive ATPase activity was unchanged from control in the proximal convoluted tubule and in the medullary thick ascending limb; in the cortical thick ascending limb enzyme activity increased. These results demonstrate a change in both Na-K ATPase and NEM-sensitive ATPase activities as a direct consequence of a defect known to result in salt wastage and an acidification defect in humans and animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism in human kidney cortex from several postmortem subjects has been characterized. Using HPLC and GC/MS, four cytochrome P450-arachidonic acid metabolites were tentatively but not unequivocally identified as epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHT) and 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, suggesting the involvement of two major cytochrome P450 enzymes, epoxygenase and omega/omega-1 hydroxylases. This pattern of metabolism was similar to that found in rabbit and rat kidneys. The formation of these metabolites was dependent on the presence of NADPH and inhibited by IgG of NADPH-cytochrome P450 (c) reductase. Immunologic studies of renal cytochrome P450 epoxygenase demonstrated that antibodies prepared against human-purified hepatic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase recognized renal enzyme protein and inhibited the enzyme activity by 92%. In contrast, control immunoglobulin did not inhibit renal cytochrome P450 epoxygenase. Antibody inhibition of renal cytochrome P450 epoxygenase demonstrated a degree of conservation of both enzyme proteins between liver and kidney. Antibodies against lauric acid omega/omega-1 hydroxylases (P450 omega) inhibited the formation of omega/omega-1 hydroxylase products, 19- and 20-HETEs. Identical qualitative patterns of arachidonic acid metabolites were observed in all cortical microsomes studied. Interindividual variations were observed in the cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism, and the activities ranged from 0.031 to 5.027 nmol arachidonic acid converted/mg protein/30 min. which is about a 150-fold difference. However, when the specific activities for total cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism were calculated, two separate groups could be distinguished, high and low metabolizers of arachidonic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The critical pathways through which protein-tyrosine kinases induce cellular proliferation and malignant transformation are not well defined. As microinjection of antibodies against p21ras can block the biological effects of both normal and oncogenic tyrosine kinases, it is likely that they require functional p21ras to transmit their mitogenic signals. No biochemical link has been established, however, between tyrosine kinases and p21ras. We have identified a non-catalytic domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, SH2, that regulates the activity and specificity of the kinase domain. The presence of two adjacent SH2 domains in the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) indicates that GAP might interact directly with tyrosine kinases. Here we show that GAP, and two co-precipitating proteins of relative molecular masses 62,000 and 190,000 (p62 and p190) are phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells that have been transformed by cytoplasmic and receptor-like tyrosine kinases. The phosphorylation of these polypeptides correlates with transformation in cells expressing inducible forms of the v-src or v-fps encoded tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, GAP, p62 and p190 are also rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Our results suggest a mechanism by which tyrosine kinases might modify p21ras function, and implicate GAP and its associated proteins as targets of both oncoproteins and normal growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. These data support the idea that SH2 sequences direct the interactions of cytoplasmic proteins involved in signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "Neurons in culture can have fundamentally distinct morphologies which permit their cytological identification and the recognition of their neurites as axons or dendrites. Microtubules may have a role in determining morphology by the selective stabilization of spatially distinct microtubule subsets. The plasticity of a neurite correlates inversely with the stability of its component microtubules: microtubules in growth cones are very dynamic, and in initial neurites there is continuous incorporation of labelled subunits, whereas in mature neurites, microtubules are highly stabilized. The binding of microtubule-associated proteins to the microtubules very probably contributes to this stability. Cerebellar neurons in dissociated culture initially extend exploratory neurites and, after a relatively constant interval, become polarized. Polarity becomes evident when a single neurite exceeds the others in length. These stable neurites cease to undergo the retractions and extensions characteristic of initial neurites and assume many features of axons and dendrites. We have now studied the role of the neuronal microtubule-associate protein tau in neurite polarization by selectively inhibiting tau expression by the addition of antisense oligonucleotides to the culture media. Although the extension of initial exploratory neurites occurred normally, neurite asymmetry was inhibited by the failure to elaborate an axon.\r"

At least two of these genes, fushi tarazu (ftz) and even-skipped (eve) share a common structural motif, the homoeobox, which encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (homoeodomain). A family of related proteins has been recently characterized in mammals and nematodes that contain a diverged homoedomain as part of a structure referred to as a POU domain. Mammalian genes encoding POU domains have region-specific patterns of expression in the central nervous system, indicating a potential role for them in the regulation of neuronal development. The nematode POU-domain gene, unc-86, is involved in the determination of neuroblast lineages leading to serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. We have now identified a Drosophila gene, Cfla, encoding a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein containing a highly conserved POU domain. The Cfla gene product binds to a DNA element required for expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (Ddc) in selected dopaminergic neurons, implying that it functions as a neuron-specific transcription factor.\r"

In five cell systems, HIV-1 is inhibited by TIBO derivatives in nanomolar amounts, which are 10(4)-10(5) times lower than the cytotoxic concentration. The unprecedented specificity of these compounds may be due to an interaction with a reverse transcriptase-associated process. By contrast, AZT (3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine), which is used for the treatment of AIDS, and DDC (2',3'-dideoxycytidine) and DDI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine), whose clinical application is being assessed, inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 at concentrations that, depending on the cell systems, are 2 to 4 orders of magnitude below their cytotoxic concentration. TIBO-derivatives are new chemicals unrelated to any other antiviral agents. We believe that they are the most specific and potent inhibitors of HIV-1 replication studied so far.\r"

  ".U": "90136949\r", 
  ".W": "RNA editing, a novel and unexpected type of information processing, was first demonstrated in the kinetoplasts of certain protozoans. It is a remarkable phenomenon: certain species of messenger RNA have nucleotide sequences that differ greatly from the sequences of the genes from which they are presumably transcribed. The differences are usually due to addition of uridylate residues, but occasionally also to their deletion. The most spectacular case of editing known occurs in the mRNA of the mitochondrial gene for subunit III of cytochrome oxidase (COIII) in Trypanosoma brucei. This mRNA is twice the length of its gene owing to the addition of several hundred uridylate residues and a few deletions, spread over the entire length of the RNA molecule. Whereas unedited RNA molecules, the nucleotide sequences of which correspond to the genomic sequence, have been isolated, no DNA template corresponding to the edited RNA sequence has been detected in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome. It was suggested, therefore, that unedited mRNAs are transcribed from mitochondrial DNA and then edited post-transcriptionally by endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript at specific sites, followed by insertion or deletion of uridylate residues and religation. We have now examined the general nature of the RNA editing process to determine whether it involves the insertion of nucleotide residues into pre-existing molecules or the continuous de novo synthesis of edited mRNA. The results of our experiments rule out an insertion mechanism and strongly indicate that edited mRNA is synthesized as a unit.\r"

Here we report that in 12 of 14 families we have analysed, the new mutation is of paternal origin. This result is similar to that recently obtained for retinoblastoma. In other genetic disorders that show a bias towards paternal origin of new mutations, there is a marked increase in the incidence of mutations with paternal age, consistent with the mutations arising from replication errors in mitosis of spermatogonial stem cells. In retinoblastoma and NF-1, however, such paternal age effects are slight or absent. The mechanism or timing of germline mutation could therefore be different in the two cases.\r"

  ".W": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that transcription of the human c-fos oncogene is activated through the action of the 289-amino acid adenovirus E1A gene product. In this study we have utilized a series of c-fos promoter deletion and substitution mutants to define regulatory sequences that allow the induction by E1A. Although the deletion of upstream promoter sequences has varying degrees of effect on overall promoter activity, these deletions retain inducibility by E1A. This includes the deletion of the serum response element and two elements that bind the ATF transcription factor. In fact, a c-fos promoter deleted to position -53, which leaves the TATA element but no other known functional element, retains inducibility, indicating a role for the TATA element in E1A control. Indeed, substitution of the c-fos TATA element (TATAA) with a TATA sequence from the simian virus 40 early promoter (TATTTAT) abolishes E1A inducibility; this promoter does retain responsiveness to cAMP induction, however, demonstrating that this TATTTAT substitution is functional. We conclude that the E1A-dependent activation of c-fos transcription is mediated through an effect on a TATA-binding protein that has specificity for the TATAA sequence.\r"

In each case, the point mutations responsible for activation have been characterized. Results presented demonstrate the carcinogen-specific nature of these ras mutations. For each initiating agent, a distinct spectrum of mutations is observed. Most importantly, the distribution of ras gene mutations is found to differ between benign papillomas and carcinomas, suggesting that molecular events occurring at the time of initiation influence the probability with which papillomas progress to malignancy. This study provides molecular evidence in support of the existence of subsets of papillomas with differing progression frequencies. Thus, the alkylating agents MNNG and MNU induced exclusively G ---- A transitions at codon 12, with this mutation being found predominantly in papillomas. MCA initiation produced both codon 13 G ---- T and codon 61 A ---- T transversions in papillomas; only the G ---- T mutation, however, was found in carcinomas. These findings provide strong evidence that the mutational activation of Ha-ras occurs as a result of the initiation process and that the nature of the initiating event can affect the probability of progression to malignancy.\r"

  ".U": "90138868\r", 
  ".W": "Although the exocytotic mechanism for quantal acetylcholine (ACh) release has been widely accepted for many years, it has repeatedly been challenged by reports that ACh released upon stimulation originates from the cytosol rather than synaptic vesicles. In this report, two independent experimental approaches were taken to establish the source of ACh released from the electromotor system of Narcine brasiliensis. Since ATP is colocalized with ACh in the cholinergic vesicle, the exocytotic theory predicts the corelease of these two components with a stoichiometry identical to that of the vesicle contents. The stimulated release of ATP from isolated synaptosomes could be accurately quantitated in the presence of the ATPase inhibitor adenosine 5'-[alpha, beta-methylene]triphosphate (500 microM), which prevented degradation of the released ATP. Various concentrations of elevated extracellular potassium (25-75 mM), veratridine (100 microM), and the calcium ionophore ionomycin (5 microM) all induced the corelease of ACh and ATP in a constant molar ratio of 5-6:1 (ACh/ATP), a stoichiometry consistent with that established for the vesicle content. In parallel to these stoichiometry studies, the compound 2-(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol (AH5183) was used to inhibit specifically the vesicular accumulation of newly synthesized (radiolabeled) ACh without affecting cytosolic levels of newly synthesized ACh in cholinergic nerve terminals. Treatment with AH5183 (10 microM) was shown to inhibit the release of newly synthesized ACh without markedly affecting total ACh release; thus, the entry of newly synthesized ACh into the synaptic vesicle is essential for its release. We conclude that ACh released upon stimulation originates exclusively from the vesicular pool and is coreleased stoichiometrically with other soluble vesicle contents.\r"

  ".W": "Colonic neoplasia provides an opportunity to study tumor progression because most carcinomas arise from adenomas (polyps), which, in turn, arise from normal epithelia. The malignant potential of adenomas varies with size, histology, and degree of dysplasia. Polyps that are less than 2 cm with villous architecture and severe dysplasia are most likely to contain carcinoma. Previous studies demonstrated that the in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activity of pp60c-src from colon carcinomas is significantly higher than that from adjacent normal mucosa. Here we report that the protein kinase activity of pp60c-src is also elevated in colonic polyps. Activity is highest in malignant polyps and in greater than 2-cm benign polyps that contain villous structure and severe dysplasia. Thus, pp60c-src activation occurs in benign polyps that are at greatest risk for developing cancer. These data suggest that activation of the protooncogene product pp60c-src may be an important event in the genesis of human colon carcinoma.\r"

[3H]Myristate was incorporated into endogenous and transfected alpha i but could not be detected in alpha s even when it was overexpressed. We converted the second residue, glycine, of alpha i1 into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Upon transfection of the mutant alpha i1 into COS cells, the [35S]methionine-labeled product was localized primarily to the soluble fraction, and, also unlike normal alpha i1, the mutant failed to incorporate [3H]myristate. The unmyristoylated mutant alpha i1 could still interact with the beta-gamma complex, since purified beta gamma subunits promoted pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of both the normal and mutant alpha i1 subunits. These results indicate that myristoylation is critical for membrane attachment of alpha i but not alpha s subunits.\r"

However, this serum dependence of transcription was relieved when 3Y1 cells were transformed by the oncogene v-src. Crossfeeding experiments showed no evidence for the production of a serum-substituting extracellular growth factor by the transformed cells. Using 3Y1 cells transformed with temperature-sensitive Rous sarcoma virus, we showed that the tyrosine kinase activity of pp60v-src was responsible for the serum-sparing effect on the level of RNA expressed from the viral promoter. Sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases that nonspecifically elevates the level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in cells, stimulated transcription from the viral promoter. The effects of both pp60v-src and orthovanadate were resistant to cycloheximide. These results suggest that the serum independence of transcription from the viral promoter in v-src-transformed cells was probably due to the constitutive activation of intracellular growth-factor pathways by the tyrosine kinase activity of pp60v-src.\r"

Class switch recombination deleted most of the constant genes of IGH (CH) and juxtaposed the C alpha 2 gene downstream of the translocation junction. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization demonstrated that the translocated segment was normally located at band p13 of chromosome 9.

The DNA sequence contains 35 unique restriction sites that are located an average of 28 base pairs apart throughout the entire length of the gene. A ribosome binding site was included 9 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and codon usage was adjusted to ensure efficient translation in E. coli. The TS gene is flanked by unique EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites that render the gene portable to any of several E. coli expression vectors. Catalytically active TS encoded by the synthetic gene is expressed in large amounts (10-20% of the soluble protein) and is indistinguishable from that isolated from L. casei. The utility of the synthetic gene for mutagenesis is demonstrated by a single experiment in which His-199 was replaced with 14 different amino acids. Analysis of the mutants by genetic complementation indicates that TS can tolerate a number of amino acid substitutions at that position and shows that His-199 is not strictly required for catalytic activity.\r"

To determine if these two oncogenes are sufficient to convert normal keratinocytes to cancer cells, freshly isolated mouse keratinocytes were coinfected with replication-defective (psi-2) v-rasHa and v-fos viruses in culture. When tested in nude mice within several days of infection, v-fos/v-rasHa-coinfected keratinocytes produced squamous cell carcinomas. Introduction of v-fos alone resulted in normal or hyperplastic skin, whereas v-rasHa alone produced squamous papillomas. These results indicate that two oncogenes are sufficient to produce the malignant phenotype in epidermal cells. Furthermore, they clearly link the fos oncogene with malignant conversion. Since fos acts as a transcriptional regulator of other genes, malignant conversion may be an indirect consequence of the overexpression of the fos-encoded protein leading to a change in the expression of fos-controlled cellular genes.\r"

The role of myristoylation in the association of alpha subunits with membranes was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and by substitution of myristate with a less hydrophobic analog, 10-(propoxy)decanoate (11-oxamyristate). Myristoylation of alpha 0 was blocked when an alanine residue was substituted for its amino-terminal glycine, as was association of the protein with membranes. Substitution of the myristoyl group with 11-oxamyristate affected the cellular distribution of a subset of acylated alpha subunits. The results are consistent with a model wherein the hydrophobic interaction of myristate with the bilayer permits continued association of the protein with the plasma membrane when G-protein alpha subunits dissociate from beta gamma.\r"

In view of recent studies suggesting that platelets also contain 22-kDa GTP-binding proteins that are homologous with ras-encoded p21 proteins, the present work was undertaken to examine the possibility that thrombolamban and the Ras-like proteins were the same. Platelet microsomes were labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP and the labeled proteins were examined by autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. On Western blots of both one-dimensional and two-dimensional gels, thrombolamban immunoreacted with M90, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the GTP-binding domain of Ras p21 proteins, but not with Y13-259, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes another domain and is specific for Ras proteins. Overlay experiments with unlabeled platelet microsomes demonstrated numerous low molecular weight proteins that bound [alpha-32P]GTP, although none could be identified as thrombolamban. Finally, thrombolamban was immunoprecipitated by M90. These studies show that thrombolamban is a low molecular weight protein that is immunologically related to the Ras family of GTP-binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is transiently produced by murine bone marrow-derived mast cells in response to antigen stimulation of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors. We have studied the postreceptor signaling pathways involved in regulating expression of the IL-3 gene in the murine mast cell line PB-3c. Large amounts of IL-3 mRNA accumulated after exposure of cells to calcium ionophore A23187, a reagent that increases intracellular Ca2+. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which stimulates protein kinase C, did not induce IL-3 mRNA accumulation, although it did potentiate the effect of A23187. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that the IL-3 gene is constitutively transcribed in unstimulated cells and that treatment with A23187 and/or phorbol ester has no influence on its transcription rate. The effect of A23187 was found to be due to stabilization of the IL-3 mRNA. In cells maintained in the presence of A23187 the IL-3 mRNA was stable during 3 hr of incubation with actinomycin D, whereas removal of A23187 under the same conditions resulted in rapid degradation of the mRNA. These results indicate that control of expression of the IL-3 gene in mast cells is primarily at the posttranscriptional level and that the Ca2(+)-dependent signal-transduction pathway plays an important role in this process. Synthesis of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA in response to A23187 and phorbol ester was found to be subject to both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we have shown that the gene encoding murine beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4-GT; UDPgalactose:N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-glycopeptide 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.38) is unusual in that it specifies two sets of mRNAs of about 3.9 and 4.1 kilobases (kb). Translation of the 3.9- and 4.1-kb mRNAs results in the predicted synthesis of two related membrane-bound forms of the protein of 386 amino acids (short form) and 399 amino acids (long form), respectively. In this study we have examined the expression of beta 1,4-GT during murine spermatogenesis. Spermatogonia contain a 4.1-kb transcript that is comparable in size to the beta 1,4-GT mRNA identified in somatic cells. During differentiation from spermatogonia (2n) to pachytene spermatocytes (4n), the amount of beta 1,4-GT mRNA is reduced to barely detectable levels. Continued differentiation to round spermatids (n) is coincident with a renewed production of beta 1,4-GT mRNA to levels comparable with those detected in spermatogonia. However, the characteristic 4.1-kb mRNA detected in spermatogonia is replaced by two truncated transcripts of 2.9 and 3.1 kb. By S1 nuclease analysis, the 2.9- and 3.1-kb transcripts were shown to encode the same open reading frame as the 4.1-kb transcript found in somatic cells. The shorter round spermatid transcripts arise as a consequence of the use of alternative poly(A) signals. Lastly, we show that, in direct contrast to all somatic tissues and cell lines examined to date, male germ cells synthesize only the long form of the beta 1,4-GT polypeptide.\r"

Using a homologous (Elops) VH probe and DNA sequencing, this gene family has been shown to be complex and to contain overt pseudogenes. A homologous probe also has been used to isolate a full copy length cDNA containing constant (CH) as well as joining (JH) and VH regions. Genomic analyses using CH-, JH-, and VH-specific probes have demonstrated the presence of only a single hybridizing CH and several JH elements. JH-CH linkage is less than or equal to 3.6 kilobases (kb) and VH-CH linkage is less than or equal to 100 kb, as estimated by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. An additional VH family sharing less than 50% nucleotide identity with the prototype Elops VH sequence is described. Taken together, these results suggest that the immunoglobulin VH locus in a comparatively primitive teleost resembles the VH locus in mammals, but not that found in the more phylogenetically distant elasmobranchs. The evolutionary radiations of cartilaginous and bony fishes are associated with a dramatic change in the organization and, presumably, regulation of immunoglobulin genes. The origins of the modern VH gene locus can be traced to the primitive teleost fishes.\r"

The genes are scattered throughout the genome, some near mutations known to affect eye function. One of these clones has been identified, by sequence analysis, as the structural gene (Arr) for a Drosophila homolog of human arrestin. Vertebrate arrestin interacts with rhodopsin in phototransduction and has been associated with an autoimmune form of uveitis in primates. The presence of an arrestin homolog in Drosophila suggests that both the vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction cascades are regulated in a similar manner.\r"

The mini-Fos (wbFos) and the mini-Jun (wbJun) proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity by using a nickel affinity chromatography procedure. Purified wbFos and wbJun associated rapidly in vitro and interacted cooperatively with the human metallothionein IIA AP-1-binding site. However, efficient DNA binding of wbJun and wbFos-wbJun complexes required an additional activity present in nuclear extracts. This activity was sensitive to alkylating agents and could be partially mimicked by the presence of reducing and stabilizing agents. DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that Jun homodimeric complexes and Fos-Jun heterodimeric complexes interacted with the same site on the human metallothionein IIA gene. Moreover, UV-crosslinking studies demonstrated that Fos and Jun contact DNA directly and that both proteins interacted equivalently with either strand of the AP-1-binding site.\r"

The order of magnitude of the rate of K+ efflux per colicin molecule was comparable to that of ion channels. The dependence of K+ efflux upon multiplicity, pH, temperature, and membrane potential (delta psi) was determined. The translocation of colicin A from the outer membrane receptor to the inner membrane and insertion into the inner membrane required a fluid membrane, but once inserted, the channel properties showed little dependence upon the state of the lipids. At a given multiplicity, the lag time before the onset of K+ efflux was found to reflect the time required for translocation and/or insertion of colicin into the cytoplasmic membrane. Opening of the channel only occurred above a threshold value of delta psi of 85 +/- 10 and 110 +/- 5 mV at pH 6.8 and 7.8, respectively. Conditions were designed for closing and reopening of the channel in vivo. These conditions allowed us to test separately the delta psi requirements for translocation and channel opening: translocation and/or insertion did not appear to require delta psi. The channel formed in vivo featured properties similar to that of the channel in lipid planar bilayers.\r"

PKC activity was assayed by a procedure that is virtually background-free, thus permitting assay of protein kinase activity in highly diluted samples of solubilized membranes. Hormone-dependent increases in PKC activity were limited to plasma membranes. Stimulation of the kinase was half-maximal with 70 pM insulin, and the hormone effect was rapid. Oxytocin and vasopressin produced effects on PKC similar to insulin, but the magnitude of the vasopressin stimulation exhibited seasonal variations. Treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a loss of PKC activity from the cytosol and a gain in plasma membrane activity, indicative of translocation of the enzyme. With activity measurements it was not possible to determine if insulin stimulated a translocation of the kinase. However, Western blot analysis of plasma membranes with polyclonal antibodies directed against PKC suggest that at least some of the insulin-stimulated PKC activity resulted from enzyme translocation.\r"

The immunofluorescence pattern of H2 in axoplasm was similar to that seen in mammalian cells with antibodies specific for kinesin light and heavy chains, indicating that squid kinesin is also concentrated on membrane-bounded organelles. Although kinesin is assumed to be a motor for translocation of membrane-bounded organelles in fast axonal transport, direct evidence has been lacking. Perfusion of axoplasm with purified H2 at 0.1-0.4 mg/ml resulted in a profound inhibition of both the rates and number of organelles moving in anterograde and retrograde directions in the interior of the axoplasm, and comparable inhibition was noted in bidirectional movement along individual microtubules at the periphery. Maximal inhibition developed over 30-60 min. Perfusion with higher concentrations of H2 (greater than 1 mg of IgG per ml) were less effective, whereas perfusion with 0.04 mg of H2 per ml resulted in minimal inhibition. Movement of membrane-bounded organelles after perfusion with comparable levels of irrelevant mouse IgG (0.04 to greater than 1 mg/ml) were not distinguishable from perfusion with buffer controls. Inhibition of fast axonal transport by an antibody specific for kinesin provides direct evidence that kinesin is involved in the translocation of membrane-bounded organelles in axons. Moreover, the inhibition of bidirectional axonal transport by H2 raises the possibility that kinesin may play some role in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport.\r"

Then a second strand was synthesized and amplified by using two sets of DNA primers that (i) hybridized to the ends of the light- and heavy-chain variable regions, (ii) encoded a linker peptide, and (iii) contained appropriate restriction enzyme sites for cloning. After 30 cycles of PCR, the DNA fragments containing sequences encoding the light- and heavy-chain variable regions were cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a portion of the Pseudomonas exotoxin gene. Clones encoding recombinant single-chain immunotoxins were expressed in E. coli and the protein product was assessed for its ability to bind to or kill cells bearing the OVB3 antigen. By using this approach it should be possible to rapidly clone the functional variable region sequences of many different antibodies from hybridoma RNA.\r"

Two major DNA-binding proteins that bind in a sequence-specific manner to the octamer DNA sequence have been identified in mammalian species--a ubiquitously expressed protein (Oct-1) and a lymphoid-specific protein (Oct-2). During characterization of the promoter region of the chicken immunoglobulin light chain gene, we identified two homologous octamer-binding proteins in chicken B cells. When the cloning of the human gene for Oct-2 revealed it to be a member of a distinct family of homeobox genes, we sought to determine if the human Oct-2 cDNA could be used to identify homologous chicken homeobox genes. Using a human Oct-2 homeobox-specific DNA probe, we were able to identify 6-10 homeobox-containing genes in the chicken genome, demonstrating that the Oct-2-related subfamily of homeobox genes exists in avian species. Low-stringency screening of a chicken embryonic cDNA library allowed us to clone one of these genes. DNA sequence analysis revealed it to be the chicken homologue of the human Oct-1 gene. The predicted protein sequence of the chicken Oct-1 gene demonstrated that the gene for Oct-1 has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution with an overall 96% amino acid sequence identity between the chicken and human proteins. The previously described POU domain (termed POU for its presence in the Pit-1, Oct-1/Oct-2, and Unc-86 genes) and homeobox domain are 100% conserved between the two protein products. Together, our data show that the POU-containing subfamily of homeobox genes have been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution, apparently as a result of selection for their DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory properties.\r"

Two c-Ki-ras oncogene sequences were identified in DNA from liver tumors that contained nucleotide changes absent in DNA from livers of untreated control rats. Sequence changes involving G.C to T.A or G.C to A.T nucleotide substitutions in codon 12 were scored in three of eight tumor-bearing animals. Distributions of c-Ki-ras sequences in tumors and normal liver DNA indicated that the observed nucleotide changes were consistent with those expected to result from direct mutagenesis of the germ-line protooncogene by aflatoxin B1. N-ras oncogene sequences were identified in DNA from two of eight tumors. Three N-ras gene regions were identified, one of which was shown to be associated with an oncogene containing a putative activating amino acid residing at codon 13. All three N-ras sequences, including the region detected in N-ras oncogenes, were present at similar frequencies in DNA samples from control livers as well as liver tumors.

In addition to inhibiting alpha 2AP in plasma, RWR binds to and inhibits fibrin cross-linked alpha 2AP and reproduces the \"spontaneous\" clot lysis that is the hallmark of human alpha 2AP deficiency. By inhibiting the inactivation of plasmin by alpha 2AP, RWR interacts synergistically with plasminogen activators to increase the potency (for 50% clot lysis) of urokinase by 80-fold, tissue plasminogen activator by 27-fold, and streptokinase by 20-fold. Yet, for a given amount of fibrinolysis, the combination of RWR and lower doses of plasminogen activator leads to less fibrinogen consumption than is obtained with higher, equipotent doses of plasminogen activator alone. These results suggest a strategy for increasing the efficacy of plasminogen activators. More generally, this approach to amplifying enzymatic activity by immunoneutralizing an inhibitor may be useful in other biologic processes that are rigidly governed by inhibitors.\r"

In this paper we show that one of the components of this division-inhibition system, the minC gene product, is also an essential component of another division-inhibition system, which is induced by derepression of the dicB gene and leads to inhibition of septation at all potential division sites. The two minC-dependent division-inhibition systems could be functionally distinguished by their different responses to the minE gene product. The results suggest a model in which a common mechanism, mediated by MinC, is responsible for the division block in a class of division-inhibition systems that can be independently activated by different proteins that determine the specific properties of these systems.\r"

The prototype vector, pHSVlac, contains a transcription unit that places the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the HSV-1 immediate early 4/5 promoter. pHSVlac was propagated using the HSV-1 temperature-sensitive mutant ts K as helper virus. Infection of rat neurons in primary culture derived from various regions throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex, resulted in stable expression of high levels of beta-galactosidase for at least 2 weeks, without cell damage. Since other genes can be expressed from pHSVlac, HSV-1 vectors may prove useful for delivery of genes into central nervous system neurons for studies on nervous system physiology or to perform gene therapy for neurological conditions.\r"

We describe a unique member of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 70-kDa heat shock protein gene family (HSP70) that encodes a protein homologous to mammalian BiP. The DNA sequence contains a 2046-nucleotide open reading frame devoid of introns, and examination of the predicted amino acid sequence reveals features not found in most other yeast HSP70 proteins but which are present in BiP. Most notable are a 42-residue sequence at the N terminus that exhibits characteristics of a cleavable signal sequence and a C-terminal sequence, -His-Asp-Glu-Leu, that is involved in determining endoplasmic reticulum localization in yeast. The 5' flanking region of this gene contains two overlapping sequences between nucleotides -146 and -169 that closely resemble consensus heat shock elements. The yeast BiP gene is strongly heat shock-inducible, whereas the BiP genes in various other species are either weakly or non-heat-inducible. We demonstrate that a functional BiP gene is essential for vegetative growth. An evolutionary comparison of amino acid sequences of 34 HSP70 proteins from 17 species suggests that BiP genes share a common ancestor, which diverged from other HSP70 genes near the time when eukaryotes first appeared.\r"

High levels of alpha 3 and beta 2 subunits and low levels of alpha 1 subunits were detected in adult glands. No alpha 2 or beta 1 subunits were detectable at either developmental stage. Examination of the enzymatic properties of the pineal gland alpha 3 isoform suggests that this enzyme is a ouabain-sensitive ATPase whose activity is dependent upon Na+ and K+. This ATPase exhibited a lower apparent Km for Na+ than the kidney alpha 1 isoenzyme and did not show positive cooperative Na+ activation. Our results suggest that the activity of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha 3 isoenzyme may be adapted to function under conditions of hyperpolarizing transmembrane potentials.\r"

Fixation by microwave irradiation prevented three problems found with other fixation methods: nucleotide loss from cells, nucleotide diffusion within cells, and chemical modification of immunologic epitopes. Six agonists (four that stimulate adenylate cyclase and two that stimulate guanylate cyclase) produced cAMP or cGMP accumulation patterns that were agonist-specific, dose-dependent, detectable at physiologic concentrations of hormone, and time-dependent within 15 sec to 30 min. cAMP accumulation after 1 mM forskolin was greatest in the nucleus. Isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2, or calcitonin caused initial accumulation of cAMP along the plasma membrane, but later accumulation was greater in the cytoplasm. With calcitonin the later accumulation of cAMP was selectively perinuclear and along the nuclear membrane. Sodium nitroprusside stimulated cGMP accumulation diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Atrial natriuretic peptide initiated cGMP accumulation near the plasma membrane, and cGMP accumulation moved from there into the cytoplasm. In conclusion, microwave irradiation preserved cell structure and allowed visualization of expected as well as unsuspected changes in intracellular accumulation patterns of cAMP and cGMP.\r"

  ".W": "Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are linked to a large number of surface membrane receptors and appear to regulate a variety of effector systems located both in the plasma membrane and in other parts of the cell. The mechanism of the disseminative actions of G proteins remains obscure. During an investigation of the fate of two types of G proteins, Gs and Gi, in rat adipocytes, we unexpectedly found that isoproterenol, which stimulates cAMP levels and lipolysis in these cells, induces parallel increases in both Gs and Gi in a low-density microsomal fraction rich in endosomes and Golgi bodies. Two plasma membrane constitutive enzymes, adenylyl cyclase and 5'-nucleotidase, are also elevated in this fraction. NaF and NaN3, metabolic inhibitors, block the redistribution process. The isoproterenol-stimulated shifts are completely reversible after removal of the hormone, indicating a recycling, endocytic process. The endocytic process seems to be fluid phase endocytosis, or pinocytosis, since isoproterenol stimulates the uptake of both fluorescent-labeled dextran and horseradish peroxidase into the same vesicles containing Gs. However, the vesicles that accumulate in response to isoproterenol seem heterogenous in properties that may reflect the lipolytic process induced by isoproterenol. It is speculated that the \"pinosomes\" formed in response to lipolytic hormones may continually produce signals within the cellular interior during their processing and cycling. Hence, signal production in response to hormones need not be confined to the cell membrane; circulating pinosomes may be responsible for some of the disseminative effects of hormones.\r"

Among the consistently abundant nucleotide oligomers, there are two complementary pairs of palindromic nucleotide pentamers containing TG and CA. Out of the CAGTG and CACTG pair emerged the heptameric pair for the long-distance recombination of immunoglobulin genes, CACAGTG and CACTGTG. Reflecting their origin, these heptamers are found everywhere in all DNA, and a substantial fraction of them are accompanied by nonameric components properly spaced from them. It appears that, were the recombination event not confined to B cells, results of illegitimate recombinations might be disastrous. The other pentameric pair is TGCAT and ATGCA. Out of this pair emerged the complementary pair of transcription enhancer decamers: TNATTTGCAT for immunoglobulin light chains and ATGCAAATNA for immunoglobulin heavy chains. Again reflecting their origin, these decamers are found everywhere in all DNA and some genes--for example, in the 3' flanking region of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region--are accompanied by a downstream \"TATA box.\" It seems that even with regard to the productively recombined immunoglobulin genes, misinitiation of enhanced transcription is a real possibility.\r"

The nitrate reductase gene from wild-type Chlamydomonas was used to complement a mutation in the corresponding gene of a strain containing nit1-305. Transformants were selected by growth with nitrate as sole source of nitrogen. The transforming DNA integrated into the genome at a low-copy number in nit+ transformants. When cells carrying nit1-305 were agitated in the presence of two plasmids, one with the gene for nitrate reductase and the second with an unselected gene, the unselected gene was present in 10-50% of nit+ transformants. This high frequency of cotransformation will allow any cloned gene to be introduced into Chlamydomonas. Moreover, the overall efficiency of transformation should be high enough to permit isolation of genes from genomic libraries by complementation of stable nuclear mutants. The availability of efficient nuclear and chloroplast transformation in Chlamydomonas provides specific advantages for the study of chloroplast biogenesis, photosynthesis, and nuclear-chloroplast genome interactions.\r"

No correlation between TNF-alpha levels and HLA-A, -B, and -C genotype was found. The relevance of this quantitative polymorphism to the genetic predisposition to lupus nephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients was investigated. DR2, DQw1-positive SLE patients show low levels of TNF-alpha inducibility; this genotype is also associated with an increased incidence of lupus nephritis. DR3-positive SLE patients, on the other hand, are not predisposed to nephritis, and these patients have high TNF-alpha production. DR4 haplotype is associated with high TNF-alpha inducibility and is negatively correlated with lupus nephritis. These data may help explain the strong association between HLA-DR2, DQw1 in SLE patients and their susceptibility to nephritis.\r"

As the relevance of this activity to in vivo function is unknown, we have taken advantage of the conserved nature of ARF to study its function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells bearing an arf1 null mutation display a number of phenotypes suggesting a defect in the secretory pathway. Secreted invertase is only partially glycosylated, and there is a small internal accumulation of invertase. Genetic experiments revealed interactions between ARF1 and other genes known to be involved in the secretory pathway, including YPT1, which encodes a different GTP-binding protein. In accord with these genetic results, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy show that ARF protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells, in particular to the cytosolic surface of predominantly cis-Golgi membranes. Together, these results indicate that ARF functions in intracellular protein transport to or within the Golgi apparatus, a role not predicted by the previous in vitro biochemical studies.\r"

It is a glycoprotein of approximately 15,500 daltons that is synthesized and secreted after activation by antigen or mitogen. By using the analogs 8-azidoadenosine 5'-[gamma-32P]triphosphate [( gamma-32P]8N3ATP) and nicotinamide 2-azidoadenine [adenylate-32P]dinucleotide [( alpha-32P]2N3NAD+) as photoaffinity probes, we have detected specific, metal ion-requiring nucleotide binding sites on recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2). The specificity of these nucleotide interactions with rhIL-2 was demonstrated by saturation effects and by competition by the parent nucleotides at physiologically relevant concentrations. Saturation of photoinsertion into rhIL-2 occurred at 50 microM [gamma-32P]8N3ATP; a half-maximal decrease of its photoinsertion at 10 microM was obtained with 22 microM ATP. Saturation of photoinsertion with [alpha-32P]2N3NAD+ was observed at 180 microM; a half-maximal decrease of its photoinsertion at 10 microM was effected by 10 microM NAD+ and by 5 microM 3-aminobenzamide. The extent of photoinsertion of both photoprobes into rhIL-2 varied with the presence of different divalent metal ions. rhIL-2 photolabeling with [gamma-32P]8N3ATP appeared to be dependent on the presence of metal ion. It was effectively labeled in the presence of Mg2+ and photoinsertion was increased with the addition of Zn2+ at micromolar concentrations. Also, rhIL-2 underwent slow autophosphorylation by an intramolecular mechanism using [gamma-32P]8N3ATP as well as nonphotoactive nuceotide. The biological significance of these interactions is unknown, but their specificity suggests that nucleotide binding may be involved in the bioactivity of IL-2.\r"

The Narcine electric organ appears to be an excellent model for the study of sodium pump activation in an excitable tissue. The sodium transmembrane gradient and high-energy phosphagens were concurrently measured by 23Na and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The resting electric organ, which depends primarily on anaerobic metabolism, displays a high concentration of phosphocreatine (PCr). It has an intracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]i) of 20 +/- 10 milliequivalents/liter as estimated by NMR. Electrical stimulation of the nerves innervating the electric organ results in an increase in [Na+]i in the electrolyte and rapid depletion of PCr. Ouabain causes an 85% decrease in utilization of high-energy phosphagens, indicating that rapid PCr turnover in this tissue is mainly due to Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity. From these data we can determine that the rate of sodium pump turnover increases by greater than 3 orders of magnitude within several hundred milliseconds. In excised unstimulated electric organ slices, changes in [Na+]i equivalent to those occurring with stimulation, but induced by hyperosmolar conditions, do not result in increased PCr hydrolysis. We conclude that cholinergic stimulation of the electric organ causes a rapid and extremely large increase in sodium pump turnover, which is regulated predominantly by factors other than [Na+]i.\r"

Psp is also synthesized transiently in response to several stresses (heat, ethanol, and osmotic shock). High-level synthesis occurs only after extreme treatment. Unlike the members of the heat shock regulon, Psp induction does not require the heat shock sigma factor, sigma 32; some stimuli that elicit sigma 32-dependent heat shock proteins do not induce Psp synthesis. The level of Psp induction after extreme stress is even higher in sigma 32 mutant cells, which are unable to mount a normal heat shock response, suggesting that these parallel stress responses are interrelated.\r"

In this report we identify two nuclear factors whose binding to the murine E beta class II MHC beta-chain gene is regulated by this cytokine. IFN-gamma stimulation of murine macrophages results in the appearance of increased binding of one protein complex, complex A, and decreased binding of a second, faster migrating protein complex, complex B. Although the contact residues for both of these proteins lie within the highly conserved Y-box transcriptional element, their binding specificity differs. The protein in complex B is a CCAAT-box-binding protein that may be similar or identical to NF-Y or YB1, previously identified class II Y-box-binding proteins. The DNA sequence requirements for the binding of the slower migrating complex, complex A, are not limited to CCAAT-box sequences but include sequences upstream of the Y box. These upstream sequences are required both for IFN-gamma-induced gene transcription and for IFN-gamma-induced modulation of binding activity. These data suggest a model in which upstream sequences contribute to formation of a lymphokine-regulated complex downstream. The IFN-gamma-induced binding protein described as complex A in this report differs from the IFN-gamma, -alpha, or -beta-induced nuclear factors previously identified.\r"

We demonstrate that M. xanthus contains two independent, unlinked retrons, one for the synthesis of msDNA-Mx162 and the other for msDNA-Mx65. The structural analysis of the retron for msDNA-Mx65 revealed that the coding regions for msdRNA (msr) and msDNA (msd), and an open reading frame (ORF) downstream of msr are arranged in the same manner as found for the Mx162 retron. The ORF encodes a polypeptide of 427 amino acid residues. The amino-terminal domain (residues 1-138) shows no striking similarity to these proteins presently available in the data bases including the msDNA-Mx162 ORF, while the sequence from residues 139-394 can be aligned with various known RT sequences and has 47% identity with the RT domain of the msDNA-Mx162 ORF. On the basis of these findings, possible origins of two highly diverse retrons on the M. xanthus chromosome are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA clone has been derived from the plasma of a chimpanzee with chronic non-A, non-B viral hepatitis (NANBH). We have assayed for antibodies reacting with the encoded antigen in sera from posttransfusion hepatitis patients (643 samples from 23 patients) and their corresponding donors collected during the past 10 years in Japan. The antibody was detected in 15 out of 17 (88.2%) posttransfusion NANBH (PT-NANBH) patients whose sera over time displayed multiple alanine aminotransferase (ALT) peaks. In general, the antibody was detected after several peaks of serum ALT elevations and, once detected, it persisted for years. In contrast to the patients of chronic hepatitis, the antibody was barely detected in patients with a single episode of ALT elevation (1 out of 6). Of the 15 well-defined cases of PT-NANBH that showed multiple ALT peaks and hepatitis C virus seroconversions, 11 (73.3%) were shown to be transfused with at least one unit of blood positive for the antibody. The retrospective analysis showed that all tested donor blood found to be positive for the antibody had been transfused to recipients who afterwards developed NANBH. These data strongly suggest that the cloned cDNA originated from an etiological agent of NANBH termed the hepatitis C virus. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that had the screening been done with the anti-hepatitis C virus assay, 11 out of 17 (64.7%) cases of chronic PT-NANBH and 1 out of 6 (16.6%) acute PT-NANBH would have been prevented. The antibody assay thus can be used for diagnosis and blood screening for PT-NANBH.\r"

Live CMV vaccines in healthy adults have been shown to be safe and to induce immune responses similar to those that occur with natural CMV infection. Yet, only recently has a live CMV vaccine been tested for its protective ability. To evaluate the cost benefit and effectiveness of the proposed live CMV vaccine, we compared the following strategies: routine immunization, selective immunization of those women screened and found to be seronegative, and no immunization. Our results show that, when direct costs alone are considered, routine immunization of healthy women aged 15-25 years is cost beneficial even in populations with CMV seroprevalence as high as 87%. In populations with lower seroprevalence (55%-70%), for every 100,000 women immunized, more than 24 cases of symptomatic congenital CMV infection at birth and a similar number of cases with late sequelae (mainly deafness) would be prevented yearly. Such immunization would result in a net annual saving of $2.5 million.\r"

In a primate model of asthma, a monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 attenuated airway eosinophilia and hyperresponsiveness.

The increase in the RNA levels of the proto-oncogenes was prevented in the presence of alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D. Thus, expression of these oncogenes appears to be induced by events occurring before the onset of viral protein synthesis, perhaps by the interaction of viral particles with the cell surface.\r"

The grafts, which were implanted unilaterally into the putamen by stereotactic surgery, restored dopamine synthesis and storage in the grafted area, as assessed by positron emission tomography with 6-L-[18F]fluorodopa. This neurochemical change was accompanied by a therapeutically significant reduction in the patient's severe rigidity and bradykinesia and a marked diminuation of the fluctuations in the patient's condition during optimum medication (the \"on-off\" phenomenon). The clinical improvement was most marked on the side contralateral to the transplant.\r"

This was suppressed by treatment with chorionic gonadotropin or testosterone, but not with follicle-stimulating hormone.

Between April 1973 and June 1988, DIC occurred postoperatively in 18 of 192 patients who underwent hepatic resection because of a variety of diseases of the liver and biliary tract. The diagnosis was made on the basis of changes in platelet count, fibrinogen level, serum level of fibrin degradation product (FDP), and protamine sulfate test. Heparin was used in an earlier series but has been discontinued because of difficulty in determining the optimal dose in patients undergoing liver resection. Instead, we now use gabexate mesilate, which blocks the coagulation cascade without the aid of antithrombin III and works as an anticoagulant. Fifteen patients had uneventful recoveries, but three died. Two died of aggravation of DIC, which was a result of reoperation performed under the diagnosis of surgical bleeding. The other patient died of liver failure after fever of unknown cause persisted for 4 months. The rationale for the diagnosis and treatment of DIC after liver resection is documented, and the problems involved are discussed.\r"

Five of 90 variable available on admission were selected for inclusion in a multivariate discriminant function analysis because of their strong association with one or more of the major aetiological subsets (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, \"other,\" and undetermined). These variables were age, number of days ill before admission, presence or absence of bloody sputum and of lobar infiltration on chest radiograph, and white blood cell count. The microbial aetiology was correctly predicted by this discriminant function analysis in only 42% of cases, which gives a quantitative estimate of the degree of difficulty encountered in determining the microbial aetiology at the time of admission for pneumonia. When a similar discriminant function analysis was applied to the third of patients in whom the microbial aetiology was never determined, most of these cases were predicted to be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.\r"

Both groups with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation had significantly higher concentrations of von Willebrand factor, factor VIII:C, fibrinogen, D-dimer (a fibrinolytic product), beta-thromboglobulin, and platelet factor 4; a significantly higher fibrinogen/antithrombin ratio; and significantly higher spontaneous amidolytic activity than the healthy controls. Prekallikrein levels were significantly lower in both groups with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with sinus rhythm had normal hemostatic function, normal concentrations of platelet-related factors, and a slightly increased concentration of fibrinopeptide A compared with the healthy controls. Both groups with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation differed from the stroke patients with sinus rhythm as they did from the healthy controls. No difference in hemostatic function was seen between the nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients with and without a previous ischemic stroke.

In addition, a cousin of the index case was found to have systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid activity. Elevated concentrations of von Willebrand factor antigen were found associated with some positive lupus anticoagulant assays, the highest concentrations in the two individuals with stroke. The characteristic presentation of the index case and her good response to treatment suggests that further studies of families in whom antiphospholipid antibodies may represent a risk factor for stroke is worthwhile.\r"

One alternative medical therapy, chelation therapy with edetic acid (EDTA), has gained considerable popularity for the alleged treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease; however, its efficacy for this indication remains unproven and its use is controversial. We present a case in which chelation therapy was unsuccessful in treating coronary atherosclerosis and review reports that substantiate a lack of efficacy using chelation therapy in the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. Treatment of atherosclerotic-related diseases using chelation therapy should be discouraged by health professionals. Patients should be counseled regarding the risk of improper diagnosis and treatment of their disease.\r"

Patients with fluctuating responses that do not respond to adjustments in the carbidopa/levodopa dose may benefit from the addition of a direct-acting dopamine agonist, such as pergolide or bromocriptine. While carbidopa/levodopa and the direct-acting dopamine agonists have a proven track record as symptomatic treatment, they probably do not alter the pathologic process underlying this progressive condition. On the other hand, two studies have shown that selegiline might slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, independent of any direct effects on symptoms.\r"

The patients were followed to ascertain (1) vital status; (2) whether they suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction; (3) whether they received coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting; and (4) whether they were rehospitalized for a cardiac event. Risk factors for these events or combination of these events were identified and reported. The estimated 6-week, 6-month, and 1-year cumulative event rate of death or myocardial infarction was 9.1 +/- 1.7%, 12.9 +/- 2.0%, and 13.6 +/- 2.0%, respectively. With the exception of repeat hospital admissions, most of the above cardiac events occurred early during the patients' follow-up course. Cox proportional hazard analyses revealed that continuing chest pain after rt-PA administration, history of congestive heart failure, low systolic blood pressure at the time of initial evaluation, and history of hypertension increased the risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction, while a history of chest discomfort at baseline evaluation and older age was predictive of future hospitalization or a revascularization procedure.\r"

Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, clinically the most important form, results from the formation of heparin-dependent antibodies that are directed against the platelet membrane. In the presence of heparin, these antibodies may induce in vitro or in vivo platelet aggregation. Consequently, the course may be complicated by arterial thromboses. Treatment of this syndrome includes the prompt cessation of heparin. Since continued or future anticoagulation is usually necessary, alternative means of anticoagulation have been explored. Oral anticoagulation is often started but requires several days to take effect. Other options include low-molecular-weight heparins, antiplatelet agents, prostacyclin analogues, and low-molecular-weight dextran. In vitro laboratory tests may be helpful in guiding alternative therapy in some, but not all cases. Unfortunately, none of these agents have proved to be uniformly effective and additional agents and clinical investigation are needed before a definitive option becomes available.\r"

Multiple regression analysis was performed using preoperative variables and postoperative complications. No preoperative clinical feature was a significant predictor of higher average charge. Sternal wound infection (p = 0.0001), respiratory failure (p = 0.0001) and left ventricular failure (p = 0.017) were associated with higher average hospital charge. The absence of any complication predicted a lower average charge, and postoperative death (4.4 +/- 4.5 days after surgery) was also associated with lower average charge. A cost equation was developed: hospital charge equalled $11,217 + $41,559 of sternal wound infection, + $28,756 for respiratory failure, + $5,186 for left ventricular failure, - $1,798 for no complication and - $6,019 for death. Recognition of the influence of complications on charges suggests that low average charges can only be achieved by surgical programs with a low complication rate.\r"

Epstein-Barr virus DNA was present within tumor cells, but there was no history of prior immunosuppression or serologic evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Review of the literature reveals general agreement that CBG PO2 values are of little use in predicting arterial PO2 and that CBG pH values are reliable predictors of arterial pH; opinion varies regarding CBG PCO2. We conducted a two-part study comparing postductal arterial and CBG values. First, 50 infants were studied, each only once. All infants had umbilical arterial catheters in place. Blood was obtained simultaneously from the umbilical artery catheter and the warmed heels. Results demonstrated poor predictability of arterial values from CBG pH and PCO2 as well as for PO2. Second, to determine if variation both within and among individuals was similar, repeated measurements were made in 27 additional infants comparable to the first group. We obtained 3 to 28 simultaneous postductal arterial and CBG samples from each infant. A random-effects nested analysis of variance indicated that for pH, variation was largely the result of between-subject or within-subject replicates effects, while for PO2 and PCO2, most variation was explained by differences between the two techniques (umbilical artery catheter vs CBG). The results indicate that CBG measurements do not accurately predict arterial values in neonates. Extreme caution should be used when management decisions are based on CBG values.\r"

The patients weighed less than 2000 g at birth and were part of a study of hydrogen excretion as a screening test for necrotizing enterocolitis. Hydrogen excretion in parts per million was normalized for the quality of the expired air by dividing by the Pco2 of the gas sample The rise in the H2/CO2 ratio was influenced by gestational age, energy intake, and antibiotic usage but not by the daily frequency of feeding. The mean +/- SD peak H2/CO2 ratio was 5.1 +/- 3.6 ppm per millimeter of mercury and occurred at 16.0 +/- 11.0 days of age. The age at which the peak H2/CO2 occurred varied with gestational age. Patients born between 23 and 28 weeks gestational age (n = 34) were 22.9 +/- 13.1 days of age when they experienced their peak H2/CO2 ratio, whereas those born between 29 and 34 weeks gestational age (n = 62) were 12.2 +/- 7.5 days of age. The age at which the peak H2/CO2 ratio occurred did not differ between these two groups when corrected for the age at which oral intake exceeded 420 kJ/kg per day. These results suggest that premature neonates require experience with ingesting more than 420 kJ/kg per day before bacteria and carbohydrates are present in large enough quantities to permit measurable hydrogen production. This information will be useful in future studies of premature gut development and physiology and in studying pathologic processes in which malabsorption may play a role.\r"

Our assessment of their management suggests that resection using current microsurgical techniques is a valid treatment option if the patient has a normal pubertal endocrine makeup, if the hamartoma is pedunculated, and if the patient is young enough to require years of parenteral medical treatment. Such surgical treatment can be curative, and subsequent growth and development can be normal (patients 1 and 2). However, if the patient is near to pubertal age (patient 3) or if neurosurgical or gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue treatment is not available, the natural history (patient 4) suggests that the only undesirable effects are accelerated growth, tall stature for age, and premature sexual development during childhood, as well as the psychosocial problems that may accompany them. Adult height may be compromised, although the two patients who did not undergo a surgical procedure and did not receive gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue therapy are above the lower limits of the normal range of adult male height. Therefore, if the hamartoma is pedunculated and cessation of pubertal development is desired, resection of the hamartoma is a reasonable therapeutic option.\r"

The present report concerns a preliminary trial of patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria (greater than 1.0 g/d), which was conducted to determine the therapeutic value of SCG. Thirty patients were divided into two groups: one group (n = 15) was given oral SCG (1,200 mg/d) for 16 weeks after an observation of 4 weeks (SCG group), and the other group (n = 15) was observed without the changes of prescription (control group). No fluctuations were noted in proteinuria during the observation period in both groups. Proteinuria in the SCG group slowly decreased throughout the time course; however, a significant reduction was observed at 16 weeks as compared with that of the control group. On the other hand, no significant changes were noted in creatinine clearance (Ccr), serum albumin (s-alb), serum IgA (s-IgA), and IgA-CIC between groups. Five of 15 patients, designated \"responders\", showed a reduction in proteinuria of more than 50% of the pre-value (average value of observations period). The responder and nonresponder groups were comparable in clinical and histopathological data at the beginning of the trial. Nevertheless, no significant correlations arose concerning any point. Short-term SCG therapy may be beneficial in reducing proteinuria in some patients with IgA nephropathy. Allergic reactions may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Neurofibromatosis 2 or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (NF2) is a severe autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervous system, including meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, ependymomas, and particularly acoustic neuromas. Polymorphic DNA markers have revealed frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 22 in the tumor types associated with NF2. Family studies have demonstrated that the primary defect in NF2 is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 22, suggesting that it involves inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. We have employed a combination of multipoint linkage analysis and examination of deletions in primary tumor specimens to precisely map the NF2 locus between flanking polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 22. The 13-cM region bracketed by these markers corresponds to 13% of the genetic length of the long arm of chromosome 22 and is expected to contain less than 5 x 10(6) bp of DNA. The delineation of flanking markers for NF2 should permit accurate presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis for the disorder and greatly facilitate efforts to isolate the defective gene on the basis of its location.\r"

Haplotype frequencies estimated by maximum likelihood have been used to compute common genetic pools between the three samples and a number of other sub-Saharan African populations. Despite extreme linguistic and sociocultural differentiations and very high levels of endogamy, especially in the Bedik and Niokholo Mandenkalu, the three populations share about 90%-95% of their haplotype frequencies in a system which commonly provides strong genetic differentiations. This supports the view that, despite its importance at a large continental scale level, as it is discussed for a set of populations from many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, sociocultural differentiation usually has little effect on local genetic diversity.\r"

  ".U": "90144789\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: An increased incidence of thrombosis has been reported in patients with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) due to a lupus anticoagulant (LA), which is an antibody to negatively charged phospholipids. The antiphospholipid antibodies can be quantitated in an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) that utilizes cardiolipin as the antigen. With the development of the ELISA, two major areas of controversy have arisen. First, the correlation between assay results for LA and for the ELISA has varied widely among laboratories. Second, some investigators have described a correlation between high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and thrombotic disorders, whereas others have found no association between ACA levels and thrombosis in a general population of medical patients. To explore these issues further, the present study determined the sensitivity and specificity of an LA assay for detecting ACA in medical patients with a prolonged APTT. The association between the isotype and titer of ACA and thrombosis was examined in those patients positive for LA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma samples from 70 medical patients with a prolonged APTT by routine screening studies were tested for the presence of LA by dilution of phospholipid in an APTT system and for IgM and IgG ACA according to a standardized ELISA. Clinical records were reviewed for a history of thrombotic events by an investigator who had no knowledge of the laboratory results. RESULTS: The ACA assay gave positive results in 47 patients, 44 of whom also tested positive for LA. Thus, the sensitivity for the LA assay for detecting ACA was 94% (confidence interval, 82% to 99%). The result of the LA assay was negative in 20 of 23 patients who were ACA-negative. The specificity of the LA assay was 87% (confidence interval, 67% to 98%). Twelve of the 47 patients (26%) had a history of venous or arterial thrombosis. Of these patients, 75% tested in the high-positive range for IgG or IgM ACA, or both. Of the 35 patients without thrombosis, only 14% were in this range. Patients with thrombosis had either underlying systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, or no apparent etiology for LA. There was no history of thrombosis in patients with LA associated with infection or medication. CONCLUSION: A test for LA in medical patients with a prolonged APTT can be sensitive and specific for ACA. Determination of ACA levels in patients who have LA that is not induced by medication or infection may define those patients at increased risk for thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: This study of diarrhea in tube-fed patients was undertaken to determine the proportion of cases in which feeding formula is not responsible for the diarrhea, the causes other than the feeding formula, and the diagnostic approach to diarrhea in tube-fed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inpatients at the Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital who received nasoenteric feeding during the time period from October 1986 through May 1988 were eligible for this study. Of 123 patients who received nasoenteric feeding, 32 patients had documented diarrhea (greater than 500 mL per day for at least two consecutive days) and were enrolled. Three of these patients received hypertonic feeding formula, whereas the remaining 29 received isotonic feeding formula. Prospective determinations of the causes of diarrhea were performed. Laboratory tests included fecal leukocytes, stool osmolality, stool electrolytes, and Clostridium difficile toxin assay. Diarrhea was considered osmotic if the stool osmotic gap was greater than 100 mmol/L. Clinical management involved reducing or stopping the feeding formula, stopping suspected medications, or administering appropriate antibiotics. RESULTS: There were 32 episodes of diarrhea in tube-fed patients during the study period. A single cause could be specified in 29 cases. The tube feeding formula was responsible for diarrhea in only 21% of these cases. Medications were directly responsible in 61% and C. difficile in 17% of cases. Stool osmotic gap correctly distinguished osmotic from non-osmotic diarrhea in all cases. CONCLUSION: When diarrhea develops in properly tube-fed patients, the feeding formula is usually not responsible for the diarrhea. Patients receiving nasoenteric tube feeding are frequently placed on liquid forms of medications. Many medicinal elixirs contain sorbitol, which is often the cause of diarrhea in tube-fed patients. Review of the medications and determination of the stool osmotic gap are the initial diagnostic steps of highest yield.\r"

  ".U": "90144815\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the biochemical and clinical response of two patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to three different schedules of low-density lipoprotein apheresis compared with plasmapheresis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two female patients aged 17 years, both affected by homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, underwent low-density lipoprotein apheresis using a dextran-sulfate/cellulose affinity column on successive twice-weekly, weekly, and biweekly schedules. Plasmapheresis was carried out only at biweekly intervals. Plasma lipids and apolipoproteins A1 and B were assayed before and after each procedure. Cardiac status was assessed before and after the study. RESULTS: On schedule 1 of apheresis, the immediate post-procedure low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined to 60 mg/100 dL plasma. Quasi-steady-state values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were also markedly reduced, with levels approaching the upper limits of normal for age and sex. This response was attenuated as the intervals between procedures were prolonged. No advantage of low-density lipoprotein apheresis over plasmapheresis was observed during the biweekly protocol except that after plasmapheresis high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined by 50% or more compared with less than 10% after apheresis. The latter procedure, especially on schedules 1 and 2, caused an increase in the quasi-steady-state concentrations of both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. Thus, mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B/apo A1 ratios were reduced by more than three- to four-fold during twice-weekly apheresis. Other laboratory parameters remained stable throughout except for iron and hemoglobin levels, which were reduced with both plasmapheresis and apheresis. Xanthomas regressed significantly in the one patient who had not been treated prior to the current trial. Cardiac changes were minor in both patients. CONCLUSION: Low-density lipoprotein apheresis proved safe and effective on an accelerated protocol as well as during more conventional schedules. Owing to its simplicity, selectivity, and safety, apheresis using a dextran-sulfate/cellulose column is possibly the optimum means currently available for the extracorporeal removal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\r"

Three women had minor elevations in the LH/FSH ratio, and only one was above a ratio of 3, believed to be indicative of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Because these gonadotropin elevations did not correlate with the androgens measured and were of no value in the diagnosis or management of these women, they were not believed to be cost effective. Their routine measurements should be abandoned.\r"

Simultaneous estimation of plasma 99-126 atrial natriuretic factor, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone were also undertaken. The data were compared with those obtained in a group of nonpregnant normotensive women (n = 14) and a group of pregnant normotensive women in the early phase of the third trimester (n = 14). Urinary ouabain displacing factor and dopamine levels were significantly higher in the early phase of the third trimester, as compared with nonpregnant women. But immediately before delivery, ouabain displacing factor excretion had fallen below nonpregnant values and dopamine excretion had dropped to control values. Both remained low after delivery. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor was higher in pregnant women, as compared with nonpregnant controls and remained high just before delivery and 7 and 70 to 90 days after delivery. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels were higher during pregnancy and had fallen to nonpregnant values 7 days post partum. This drop in plasma renin activity and aldosterone by 7 days post partum, in contrast with the unchanged high values of atrial natriuretic factor, may contribute to negative sodium balance after delivery. It is concluded that there is considerable discrepancy in natriuretic and antinatriuretic factors before and after delivery.\r"

We then performed a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial of sham versus standard in-line filters to determine if bacteria or filterable particulate matter was responsible for phlebitis in the peripheral hyperalimentation group. The standard-filter group had a phlebitis rate of 74% compared with 64% in the sham-filter group. We then eliminated in-line filters and replaced the standard glucose-based solution with a glycerol-based peripheral hyperalimentation solution. The phlebitis rate decreased from 68% to 27% (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, phlebitis in peripheral hyperalimentation patients was probably due to chemical properties of the peripheral hyperalimentation solution rather than bacteria or particulates.\r"

The intubations were performed during a drill that simulates difficult tracheal intubation and therefore is associated with an increased risk of esophageal intubation. Each intubation attempt was monitored by two anesthesiologists and a research assistant who together used chest auscultation, colorimetric ETCO2, and capnography to confirm tracheal intubation and detect esophageal intubation. The reliability of the monitors was compared with capnography. Colorimetric ETCO2 confirmed tracheal intubations and detected esophageal intubations 100% of the time, as judged by capnography. There were no false-positive or false-negative decisions based on endotracheal tube position; however, one equivocal color change occurred, which was caused by failure to inflate the endotracheal tube cuff. Colorimetric ETCO2 monitoring confirmed tracheal intubation more rapidly than did chest auscultation (P less than 0.001) or capnography (P less than 0.05), and detected esophageal intubation more rapidly than did chest auscultation (P less than 0.05) and as rapidly as capnography did. Confirmation of tracheal intubation was achieved earlier than detection of esophageal intubation with all three monitors (P less than 0.05). We conclude that colorimetric ETCO2 monitoring is a safe, reliable, rapid, simple, and portable method for determining endotracheal tube position for patients who are hemodynamically stable and should be recommended where capnography is not available.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of two different doses of oral naltrexone on the adverse effects and the analgesia of epidural morphine were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Forty-five patients undergoing cesarean section were provided postoperative analgesia with 4 mg epidural morphine. Five minutes later they received 6 mg naltrexone, 9 mg naltrexone, or placebo as an oral solution. Pain relief was assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and by direct questioning of the patients. Requirement for additional analgesics and side effects were noted. Respiratory effects of epidural morphine and naltrexone were assessed using the ventilatory responses to CO2 and by monitoring O2 saturation (Spo2) using pulse oximetry. All patients in the placebo group had adequate analgesia. One of the 15 patients who received naltrexone 6 mg had inadequate analgesia versus five of the 15 patients who received naltrexone 9 mg (P less than 0.05), 9 mg versus placebo. Ten patients (67%) in the placebo group had pruritus while no patient in the 6 mg naltrexone group and one patient in the 9 mg group experienced mild pruritus (P less than 0.05), placebo versus other two groups. The CO2 response slopes were depressed compared to control values from 6-16 h in the placebo group, from 6-12 h in the 6 mg naltrexone group. No significant depression was noted in the 9 mg naltrexone group. The authors conclude that oral naltrexone 6 mg significantly reduces the incidence of pruritus associated with epidural morphine without affecting analgesia and that 9 mg naltrexone is associated with shorter duration of analgesia than 6 mg naltrexone.\r"

  ".U": "90145640\r", 
  ".W": "Nine patients who had developed pulmonary artery hypertension during the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were treated with an infusion of prostacyclin (PGI2) (12.5-35.0 ng.kg-1.min-1). Whether PGI2 might decrease the pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) obtained by analysis of the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure decay curve and improve systemic oxygen delivery was examined. Gas exchange alterations induced by PGI2 were analyzed by using the multiple inert gas elimination technique. PGI2 reduced the pulmonary artery pressure from 35.6 to 28.8 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and the PCP from 22.9 to 19.7 mmHg (P less than 0.01) without changing the contribution of the pulmonary venous resistance to the total pulmonary vascular resistance. The cardiac index increased from 4.2 to 5.7 1.min-1.m-2 (P less than 0.001) due to both increased stroke volume and heart rate. Despite a marked deterioration of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) matching with increased true intrapulmonary shunt flow from 28.6% to 38.6% (P less than 0.01) of the cardiac output, the PaO2 was unchanged due to increased mixed venous oxygen content indicated by an augmented mixed venous PO2 (from 37.0 to 41.9 mmHg, P less than 0.01). This caused a 35% (P less than 0.001) increase of the systemic oxygen delivery rate. Thus, short-term infusions of PGI2 reduced PAP and PCP without deleterious effects on arterial oxygenation in patients with ARDS. Hence, PGI2 may be useful to lower pulmonary vascular pressures in patients with ARDS.\r"

Its safety and efficacy were evaluated in a 28-day study conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (loratadine, 10 mg OD; terfenadine, 60 mg BID; or placebo). Evaluation of efficacy included weekly assessments of the individual disease signs and symptoms, the overall disease condition, and therapeutic response to treatment. Throughout the 28-day treatment period progressive improvement was observed in the loratadine and terfenadine treatment groups; however, at each evaluation, loratadine was significantly more effective than placebo (P less than .01) and clinically more effective than terfenadine in reducing disease signs and symptoms. Terfenadine was significantly more effective than placebo at day 7 and endpoint (last valid visit). The overall therapeutic response at the endpoint of treatment was rated as marked or complete relief of symptoms in 64%, 52%, and 25% of the patients in the loratadine, terfenadine, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Loratadine was well tolerated and comparable to terfenadine and placebo in incidence of adverse experiences. Sedation was reported in one patient each in the terfenadine and placebo treatment groups and an anticholinergic side effect (dry mouth) in one terfenadine-treated patient. No sedative or anticholinergic side effects were observed in patients receiving loratadine. We concluded that loratadine, 10 mg, once daily is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic relief of chronic idiopathic urticaria.\r"

Included were the trigger diagnoses from the five high-risk areas of extremity laceration, epiglottitis, abdominal pain, meningitis, and myocardial infarction. The three kinds of medical records that were compared were handwritten records, records dictated and transcribed, and records created by a voice-activated word processor. From a risk management perspective, inclusion of critical pertinent positives and negatives was taken as an index of quality from a risk management perspective, and records created by a voice-activated word processor using real-time risk management prompts were superior to handwritten and dictated records.

Dogs were embolized with radioactive autologous blood clot to increase mean pulmonary artery pressure (from 13 to 34 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and decrease cardiac output (2.5 to 1.6 L min, p less than 0.005). Four groups of six dogs were treated. We employed two doses of UK, 30,000 U/kg (UK30) and 60,000 U/kg (UK60), and two doses of rtPA, 1 mg/kg (rtPA1) and 2 mg/kg (rtPA2). Drugs were infused over 15 min. Rate and extent of pulmonary thrombolysis were assessed by continuously counting over both lung fields with a gamma camera. Compared with treatment with UK, both rtPA regimes significantly increased thrombolysis. Mean total pulmonary thrombolysis was 14 and 23% with UK30 and UK60, respectively, and 35 and 43% with rtPA1 and rtPA2. Corresponding to the increased thrombolysis, pulmonary hemodynamics improved most with rtPA. From 90 min to 3 h, pulmonary artery pressure was significantly lower with both rtPA regimes than with either UK regime. These results indicate, at least in the model employed, that compared with treatment with UK, pulmonary thrombolysis and corresponding hemodynamic improvement are greatest with rtPA.\r"

  ".U": "90145821\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension occurs after the intravascular activation of complement. However, it is unclear which activated complement fragments are responsible for the pulmonary vascular constriction. We investigated the 21-carboxy-terminal peptide of C3a (C3a57-77) to see if it would cause pulmonary vascular constriction when infused into isolated buffer-perfused rat lungs. Injection of C3a57-77 (225 to 450 micrograms) caused mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) to rapidly increase. However, the response was transient, with Ppa returning to baseline within 10 min of its administration. C3a57-77 also resulted in an increase in lung effluent thromboxane B2 (TXB2), concomitant with the peak increase in Ppa. C3a57-77 did not affect the amount of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the same effluent samples. Indomethacin inhibited the C3a57-77-induced pulmonary artery pressor response and the associated TXB2 production. Indomethacin also decreased lung effluent 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The thromboxane synthetase inhibitors CGS 13080 and U63,357 inhibited the C3a57-77-induced pulmonary artery pressor response and TXB2 production without affecting 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. These inhibitors did not inhibit pulmonary artery pressor responses to angiotensin II. Tachyphylaxis to C3a57-77 occurred because a second dose of C3a57-77 administered to the same lung failed to cause a pulmonary artery pressor response or TXB2 production. The loss of the pressor response was not due to a C3a57-77-induced decrease in pulmonary vascular responsiveness because pressor responses elicited by angiotensin II were not altered by lung contact with C3a57-77. Thus, C3a57-77 caused thromboxane-dependent pulmonary vascular constriction in isolated buffer perfused rat lungs.\r"

Replicate challenges were matched in terms of inspired air conditions and minute ventilations (VE) in order to determine the degree of refractoriness after each type of challenge in patients with exercise-induced asthma. Ten patients exercised or hyperventilated dry, room temperature air at matched VE on two study days. When the patients FEV1 had returned to 90% of baseline or better, or at 3.75 h if FEV, had not returned to 90% of baseline, patients repeated the identical exercise or the EVH challenge. Minimum FEV1 values expressed as a percent of predicted FEV1 after the first and second exercise challenges were 52 +/- 16 and 58 +/- 17, respectively, which were statistically different (p less than 0.001; paired t test). Minimum FEV1 values after the first and second EVH challenges were 52 +/- 13 and 59 +/- 9% of predicted, respectively, which were also statistically different (p less than 0.01; paired t test). Seven of 10 subjects demonstrated higher SGaw values after the second exercise challenge compared with the first challenge, whereas eight of 10 subjects showed higher SGaw values after the second EVH challenge compared with the first challenge. Paired t test analysis indicated that percent protection, measured by FEV1, was similar after either type of challenge. We conclude that replicate exercise or EVH challenges with similarly matched inspired air conditions and VE induce similar degrees of refractoriness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Review of the literature revealed other cases with an association between the use of tocainide and the development of pulmonary complications such as pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis, and suggested that clinical improvement occurs when the correct diagnosis is made early and tocainide therapy is stopped immediately. Because tocainide is currently being widely used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, the pulmonary status of patients receiving tocainide should be monitored closely. Hopefully, awareness of this potential complication of tocainide therapy will minimize the number of cases of serious pulmonary toxicity.\r"

This gene mediates resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin but not amikacin or isepamicin. The DNA sequence of the gene and flanking regions was determined. The 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences showed near identity to sequences found abutting a variety of different genes encoding resistance determinants. It is likely that the current structure arose by the integration of the 572-base-pair sequence containing the AAC(6')-II gene into a Tn21-related sequence at the recombinational hot spot, AAAGTT. We have compared the sequence of the AAC(6')-II gene to genes of other 6'-N-acetyltransferases. An AAC(6')-Ib protein (encoded by the aacA4 gene; G. Tran Van Nhieu and E. Collatz, J. Bacteriol. 169:5708-5714, 1987) that results in resistance to amikacin but not gentamicin was found to share 82% sequence similarity with the AAC(6')-II protein.

  ".U": "90146254\r", 
  ".W": "The recovery of peptidoglycan-synthesizing activity after inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated in ether-permeabilized cells of Escherichia coli B. Such cells synthesize sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble peptidoglycan when provided with UDP-linked precursors and Mg2+. The ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan was correlated with their affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1A and 1Bs. Penicillin-binding protein 1Bs is thought to be the major peptidoglycan synthetase in E. coli and is a major lethal target for beta-lactam antibiotics. Ether-treated bacteria were preincubated with concentrations of beta-lactams sufficient to completely inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and then treated with beta-lactamases to inactivate free antibiotic prior to measurement of peptidoglycan synthesis. At 40 min after beta-lactamase treatment, the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis was about 74% of the control rate in cells pretreated with ampicillin, but only 15% of the control in cells pretreated with penicillin G or azlocillin. Reversal of inhibition by several other antibiotics fell between these extremes. When cross-linking of peptidoglycan was measured specifically, reversal of inhibition by ampicillin also occurred more readily than that by penicillin G. Reactivation of peptidoglycan synthesis was not due to de novo synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins since it occurred under conditions that did not allow incorporation of [14C]leucine. We conclude that there is considerable variation in the stability of the inactive acyl enzymes formed between various beta-lactams and penicillin-binding protein 1Bs, with those formed by penicillin G being relatively long-lived.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrin deposition in response to bacterial peritonitis appears to predispose to residual infection in the peritoneal cavity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that intraperitoneal fibrinolysis using human recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) prevented abscess formation in a rat intra-abdominal sepsis model. To investigate the potential adverse side effects of its use in the peritoneal cavity, the effect of t-PA on colonic anastomotic wound healing and on systemic coagulation parameters was examined in the rat. T-PA did not adversely affect colonic healing five and ten days after anastomosis. In animals infected intraperitoneally at the time of the anastomosis, t-PA reversed the inhibition of healing induced by perianastomotic abscesses at five days. This effect was mediated by the ability of t-PA to prevent perianastomotic abscess formation. After intraperitoneal administration, t-PA had no effect on prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in either uninfected or infected animals and there was no evidence of clinical bleeding related to its use. These studies suggest that intraperitoneal fibrinolysis using t-PA may provide a safe, effective form of adjuvant therapy in the management of fibrinopurulent peritonitis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the incidence of enteric fever among travelers and foreign residents who attended an expatriate clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal, from February 1987 to June 1988. There were 42 cases of enteric fever; 20 were caused by Salmonella typhi and 22 by Salmonella paratyphi A. Among 18 unvaccinated foreigners who had enteric fever, S typhi was isolated from 67%, and S paratyphi A from 33%, a ratio similar to the local Nepalese population. Among 22 vaccinated foreigners, S typhi was isolated from 35%, compared with 65% with S paratyphi A. Nine percent of tourists had received the oral Ty21A typhoid vaccine. However, among seven vaccinated tourists who became infected with S typhi, four (57%) had received the oral vaccine. Typhoid vaccine efficacy for tourists was calculated and showed an overall protective rate of 90% against enteric fever in general, 95% protection against S typhi, and 72% to 75% protection against S paratyphi A. We conclude that typhoid vaccine should be recommended to all travelers to the Indian subcontinent, and since S paratyphi A is the predominant cause of enteric fever among vaccinated travelers, consideration should be given to an effective vaccine against S paratyphi A when that becomes available.\r"

We have evaluated the merit of these two methods through a retrospective chart review of patients followed up at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa. We found that in 17 (45%) of 38 follow-up visits, the presence of interfering antibodies prevented the measurement of serum thyroglobulin levels. Furthermore, such determination was less sensitive than iodine 131 total-body scan in detecting residual thyroid tissue and/or cancer in the neck area. We concluded that iodine 131 total-body scan is the preferable method of follow-up, particularly when the goal of therapy is complete ablation of thyroid tissue.\r"

After carbamazepine treatment, the prolactin response to intravenous administration of the serotonin precursor tryptophan (5 g) was significantly enhanced, but there was no change in basal plasma tryptophan level or in tryptophan disposition after infusion. The prolactin response to intravenous protirelin (6.25 micrograms) was unaltered. Carbamazepine treatment also produced an increase in the growth hormone response to subcutaneous administration of the dopamine agonist apomorphine hydrochloride (5 micrograms/kg). These data suggest that carbamazepine may alter brain serotonin and dopamine function in humans. Such effects could be involved in the therapeutic properties of carbamazepine in affective disorder.\r"

When a 1.82-kg weight was added to one ankle and then both ankles, baseline oxygen consumption per unit distance (0.148 +/- 0.025 mL O2/kg/m) increased significantly by 7.4% (0.159 +/- 0.025 mL O2/kg/m) and 17.6% (0.174 +/- 0.027 mL O2/kg/m), respectively. The rate of oxygen consumption rose by 6.3% to 11.28 +/- 1.57 mL O2/kg/min and by 14.2% to 12.12 +/- 1.75 mL O2/kg/min, respectively, but only the latter increase was significant. When gait was analyzed using the same weight-addition protocol, velocity, cadence, stride length, gait cycle, and double-limb support time showed no change. However, asymmetric weighting decreased single-limb support time, increased the swing phase, and decreased the stance phase of gait in the weighted limb. The unweighted leg was conversely affected. Symmetric ankle weighting caused a significant increase in single-limb support time for both extremities, consistent with previous data.\r"

The patient was tested for exercise tolerance before programming, midway through the study, and immediately upon completing endurance training. Maximal METS levels achieved were 3.2 METS, 5.6 METS, and 6.3 METS, respectively. The subject began an anaerobic program consisting of 48 exercise sessions over a three-month period. Exercise sessions were interval in nature, walking at 2.5 mph, 0% grade, three repetitions, five minutes each and increasing to 3.0 mph, 2.5% grade, two repetitions, 15 minutes each. The patient improved from Class III (METS = 3.0), where less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, to Class I (METS = 6.5), where ordinary physical activity can be sustained without undue fatigue. These findings suggest that selected heart transplant patients may achieve up to 85% maximum oxygen consumption and maximum heart rate which demonstrates the need for endurance training programs in this population. This form of cardiovascular conditioning has enabled the participant to engage in higher levels of activities of daily living within the community.\r"
