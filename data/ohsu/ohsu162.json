  ".W": "A number of studies have demonstrated that high-dose corticosteroid treatment improves the rate of recovery from acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effect is more rapidly and consistently produced by high-dose corticosteroid administration than with adrenocorticotropic hormone. The most rapid improvement in clinical condition and cerebrospinal fluid parameters of patients has been observed with short courses of very high-dose intravenous therapy. This form of treatment would be most advantageous for patients with severe and rapidly progressive exacerbations. Ultimately, the duration of treatment will depend on the patient's response to treatment, tolerance of corticosteroid withdrawal, and the occurrence of significant complications of therapy. However, in our experience, a three- to four-month slowly tapered course of oral therapy is often needed, and is usually well tolerated, with few serious side effects when given once daily in the morning.\r"

All groups were similar in age, sex, duration of disease, and degree of disability before treatment. Fifty-nine percent of all cyclophosphamide-treated patients were stable at 12 months compared with 17% of all patients in the nonrandomized control group at 12 months. A statistically significant difference persisted at 18 and 24 months. A trend favoring maintenance therapy when compared with no maintenance therapy was evident at 12, 18, and 24 months, but was not statistically significant. Inpatient vs outpatient induction therapy failed to influence treatment outcome. Toxic side effects of nausea and vomiting presented a serious obstacle to maintenance therapy as administered in this protocol.\r"

After extensive plasmapheresis together with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the cerebellar symptoms of one patient ameliorated concomitantly with a reduced serum anti-Purkinje cell antibody titer. Four B-cell lines producing anti-Purkinje cell antibodies were established from one patient by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of peripheral lymphocytes. None of these antibodies reacted with peripheral T cells, although the serum anti-Purkinje cell activity of the patient was markedly reduced after absorption with purified human T cells. Thus, anti-Purkinje cell antibodies are apparently directed both to antigens unique to the cerebellar tissue and those shared by T cells.\r"

The mean IOP remained between 23% and 30% below the pretreatment level when checked 12 hours after the last drop's instillation from day 8 through day 28 of the study. No clinically significant changes in mean systolic blood pressure, blood chemistry values, urinalysis results, basal tear secretion, or corneal sensitivity were noted. The mean heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were each significantly decreased at only one of nine time intervals. Dry mouth was noted at some time in 52% of volunteers.

The MST after choroidal metastasis in patients thought to have stage I or II breast cancer, prior to diagnosis of the metastasis, was longer than that of patients with stage III or IV cancer (873 vs 139 days, respectively). Lung cancer metastasized to the eye and orbit earlier than did breast cancer (276 vs 1266 days, respectively) and had a shorter MST following this metastasis (188 vs 666 days, respectively). When age was considered as a continuous variable, the data indicated that older patients with breast metastases survived longer than did younger patients.

To evaluate contrast sensitivity function after penetrating keratoplasty, we studied 29 patients with anatomically successful corneal grafts and a best corrected visual acuity of 20/50 or better. Graft patients were compared with an age-matched control group including persons with comparable visual acuities without ocular disease. In addition to a complete ophthalmic examination, all subjects underwent contrast sensitivity testing using a computer-generated sinusoidal grating system as well as a commercially available contrast sensitivity wall chart. Data indicate that, despite comparable Snellen visual acuity, the contrast sensitivity curves for graft patients were depressed overall compared with those of normal subjects except at the lowest spatial frequency. However, comparison of grafted eyes to contralateral eyes with corneal disease in a small subset of patients with bilateral disease shows a trend toward higher contrast sensitivity values in the eyes that had been operated on. These data suggest that despite an improvement in contrast sensitivity with penetrating keratoplasty, an eye with a corneal transplant is not entirely normal from a visual standpoint. Nonacuity parameters may be important indexes for assessing real-world visual function in the graft patient, although the clinical role of these tests is not yet completely defined.\r"

Results of impression cytology, which were closely correlated with baseline serum vitamin A levels, documented histologic improvement following treatment with vitamin A. Furthermore, results of impression cytology, where abnormal, improved to normal following vitamin A treatment in a significant percentage (23%) of otherwise clinically normal children.

Analysis included the assessment of reflectivity (spike height) and nerve width (maximal diameter) with the patient fixating in primary gaze and 30 degrees of eccentric gaze; measurements were obtained from the anterior one third and posterior one third of the optic nerves. Increased nerve diameters could be distinguished as noncompressible (a negative 30 degrees test) when due to tumor, or compressible (a positive 30 degrees test) when due to increased subarachnoid fluid, as exemplified by inflammatory optic neuritis or traumatic neuropathy. Moreover, reflectivity patterns regularly differentiated meningioma (medium reflectivity) from optic glioma (low reflectivity). Neither ischemic neuropathy nor vein occlusion altered optic nerve diameter. These results indicate that echographically defined optic nerve diameter, compressibility in eccentric gaze, and reflectivity patterns can be used to effectively distinguish among causes of chronic optic atrophy (tumor vs remote neuropathy) and disc edema (tumor vs neuritis vs ischemic neuropathy).\r"

In contrast with previous reports, we found no evidence of alpha 2 M-proteinase complexes in the plasma samples from individuals in any of the groups. In our assays, all activity that might have been the result of the presence of such complexes in the plasma samples proved instead to be an artifact attributable to contamination of the anti-alpha 2M antibody immobilized on the AffiGel solid phase with a trypsin-like proteinase. When the contaminating activity was eliminated by pretreatment of the antibody with 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, no degradation of substrate was detected with any of the plasma samples. However, the ability of the solid-phase assay to detect and quantitate alpha 2M-proteinase complexes when they are present was confirmed in control experiments with plasma samples to which performed alpha 2M-trypsin complexes had been added, or in which alpha 2M-kallikrein complexes had been generated by activation of Hageman factor (coagulation factor XII). We therefore conclude that neither normal plasma nor that from rheumatoid arthritis patients contains measurable amounts of alpha 2M-proteinase complexes.\r"

Basement membrane alterations were documented in 9 patients. Eleven patients had deposits in vessel walls, but only in 1 was there evidence of inflammation. The same immunoglobulins of the cryoproteins could be demonstrated in the tissue deposits by immunofluorescence analysis and by immunoelectron microscopy. These findings suggest that, in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, immune reactants in dermal vessels of normal skin are more common than is evidenced by clinical examination. Moreover, it seems that cryoglobulins, as such, are not sufficient to trigger an inflammatory process: Additional local or plasma factors are required. Deposits were absent in 7 patients with cryoglobulinemia that was associated with a primary disorder. This could be ascribed to the lower cryocrit levels documented in this group of patients, or to the shorter duration of their disease.\r"

A 9.2-kilobase (kb) Pvu II fragment was found to be significantly increased in frequency in B27 positive AS patients compared with the B27 positive control group (P = 0.00085, relative risk = 7.2). The presence of both B27 and the 9.2-kb RFLP in an individual conferred a relative risk for AS of 297, compared with a relative risk of 119 in those who had B27 alone. The 9.2-kb RFLP appears to be a marker for AS which, with HLA-B27, contributes further to susceptibility to the disease. Our findings indicate that this fragment and HLA-B27 segregate independently in familial studies of AS.\r"

The courses were then field-tested and evaluated by 72 older (age range 52-88) OA patients in community centers for senior citizens. Statistical analysis of the findings showed significant increases in knowledge and significant self-reported, beneficial behavior changes, including increased exercise, use of heat, and rest. Our findings demonstrate that older persons can use the computer to learn to cope with OA when a thoughtfully planned program is made available in a community setting.\r"

Plasma BP-28 immunoreactivity had an apparent mol wt of 35,000 by high performance permeation chromatography. Sampled hourly for 12- or 24-h periods in 15 children with a wide range of GH secretory activity, plasma BP-28 levels showed a marked diurnal cycle, rising 10- to 20-fold between 2400 and 0600 h to a peak of 50-500 micrograms/L, then falling to basal levels (0-40 micrograms/L) by 1200 h. Plasma GH levels were measured at 20-min intervals in the same subjects. Neither peak nor basal BP-28 levels were significantly associated with chronological age, bone age, mean or peak nocturnal GH secretion, relative height, or relative growth velocity in tall, normal, short, or GH-deficient children. Plasma proteins measured in a RIA for 53,000 mol wt GH-dependent IGF-binding protein (BP-53) did not vary diurnally. The IGF-binding activity of plasma BP-28, measured by incubating plasma with IGF tracer and precipitating the BP-28-IGF complex with anti-BP-28 antiserum, closely paralleled the morning rise in BP-28 immunoreactivity. Immunoprecipitable BP-28 bound both IGF-I and IGF-II tracers, with a clear preference for IGF-I, and unlabeled IGF-I was more effective than IGF-II in displacing either tracer IGF. We conclude that plasma BP-28 levels in children have a marked diurnal rhythm which is unrelated to GH secretory activity.\r"

Only six patients of the evaluable population developed infections (6.4%). Two of these patients received antibiotic prophylaxis (4%), and the other four were control patients (8%) who developed wound infections (P = 0.41). Although most injuries were minor, if the injury was large enough to require suturing, the infection rate was slightly greater in the control group. Cross-product ratios for these small sample subgroups indicated that the likelihood of infection for non-prophylactically treated patient wounds of greater than 1 cm length and/or those requiring suturing was two to three times higher than that of patients treated prophylactically. Although no statistical significance could be ascribed to the observed differences of these post hoc categories, benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis may have been quantifiable in a study designed to assess only these major wounds utilizing a large sample size. In general, routine antibiotic prophylaxis appears unwarranted for simple intraoral lacerations in children, although it may be useful when the wounds are large enough to be sutured.\r"

Emergency department diagnosis was impeded by absence of mediastinal air; right chest-wall emphysema was thought to result from associated rib fractures. Conservative therapy consisting of nasogastric suction, intravenous antibiotics, right-chest tube drainage of a large communicating empyema cavity, temporary nasotracheal intubation with ventilatory support, total parenteral nutrition, and, finally, nasoduodenal intubation for elemental feeding were employed. This mode of therapy may be best in comparable elderly patients with esophageal perforation that is overlooked during the initial 24 hours after injury. Possibly, routine barium swallow in all patients with chest-wall emphysema and rib fractures would circumvent missed esophageal rupture after blunt trauma.\r"

The effects of the detergents, Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH, and temperature on ADP binding to collagen in fresh pericardium, and stabilization of ADP-collagen bond by borohydride (BH) reduction, were optimized. These studies indicate that pretreatment of pericardium with SDS and TX-100 increases ADP binding three- to fivefold. Three-step cross-linking via Schiff-base reactions between collagen, ADP, and cross-linking via Schiff-base reactions between collage, ADP, and glutaraldehyde gives a high value of 30 to 35 molecules of ADP per collagen in pericardium. Twenty-five millimeter tissue valves were made with detergent (1% SDS, 1% TX-100) treated ADP-bound pericardium and implanted in the mitral annuli in calves, which were killed at 60 days post implantation. Regional calcium deposition was measured with atomic absorption spectrometry. The calcium level (micrograms/mg of tissue) in components of control and four processed valves were determined. Regional platelet deposition on zones of leaflets and components of tissue valves were quantified with 111In-labeled autologous platelets. The calcium levels in thrombus and flexion zones of treated valves are lower than that in the control valve. SEM studies of leaflet surfaces at 60 days indicate that these treatment processes reduce calcification and promote spontaneous cell coverage on leaflets around the smooth surface of the outflow tract.\r"

Similar haemodynamic responses to sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and awakening from anaesthesia were found with both analgesics. Although the times to awakening and extubation were somewhat shorter in patients receiving alfentanil, the differences between the groups were not significant. With the continuous infusion techniques, plasma opiate concentrations could be maintained well above the awakening values during cardiopulmonary bypass.

Plasma cortisol concentration decreased significantly in both groups during the anaesthesia and surgery before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); an increase was evident during CPB in both groups, but a statistically significant increase was not observed during the rest of the study, including the awakening from anaesthesia. PBEir increased with both opiates immediately after initiation of CPB and remained so during the rest of the study. There were no significant changes in plasma AVP concentrations during anaesthesia and surgery. After discontinuation of opiate infusions, an increase in AVP concentration commenced earlier in the alfentanil group than in the fentanyl group. At awakening from anaesthesia, a significant correlation was observed between log plasma AVP concentration and systemic vascular resistance. It is concluded that, with continuous fentanyl and alfentanil infusions in a total dose relationship of 1:13 in patients undergoing CABG, cortisol and AVP responses to surgery and CPB can be suppressed. However, during recovery from anaesthesia, the attenuating effect of alfentanil seems to wear off more rapidly than that of fentanyl. PBEir response to CPB and emergence from anaesthesia could not be prevented with either analgesic.\r"

It was previously given the acronym HARD +/- E, indicating what were regarded as the pathognomonic features, namely hydrocephalus, agyria, and retinal dysplasia with or without encephalocele. We report the case of a male infant with the typical cerebral features of hydrocephalus, agyria, and pseudoencephalocele, but without retinal dysplasia. Peters' anomaly and optic nerve hypoplasia were the main ocular defects. We believe that anterior chamber defects and optic nerve hypoplasia are the ocular defects more directly related developmentally to the cerebral defects. Definition of ocular defects is important, since diagnosis and counselling rely heavily on ocular signs, which help to distinguish this syndrome from neural tube defects in general.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which activated protein C stimulates fibrinolysis was studied in a simple radiolabeled clot lysis assay system containing purified tissue-type plasminogen activator, bovine endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), plasminogen, 125I-fibrinogen and thrombin. Fibrinolysis was greatly enhanced by the addition of purified bovine activated protein C; however, in the absence of PAI, activated protein C did not stimulate clot lysis, thus implicating this inhibitor in the mechanism. In clot lysis assay systems containing washed human platelets as a source of PAI, bovine-activated protein C-dependent fibrinolysis was associated with a marked decrease in PAI activity as detected using reverse fibrin autography. Bovine-activated protein C also decreased PAI activity of whole blood and of serum. In contrast to the bovine molecule, human-activated protein C was much less profibrinolytic in these clot lysis assay systems and much less potent in causing the neutralization of PAI. This species specificity of activated protein C in clot lysis assays reflect the known in vivo profibrinolytic species specificity. When purified bovine-activated protein C was mixed with purified PAI, complex formation was demonstrated using immunoblotting techniques after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These observations suggest that a major mechanism for bovine protein C-dependent fibrinolysis in in vitro clot lysis assays involves a direct neutralization of PAI by activated protein C.\r"

The addition of 4.5 X 10(-7) mol/L plasmin to washed platelets caused a time-dependent decrease in ristocetin-induced, vWF-dependent platelet agglutination. epsilon-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) inhibited plasmin release of glycocalicin-related antigen from washed platelets and preserved vWF-dependent platelet agglutination, thus indicating that the lysine-binding sites on plasmin facilitated its degradation of GpIb. To demonstrate a direct interaction between plasmin and the vWF-binding region of GpIb we incubated purified glycocalicin with plasmin. Plasmin degraded the glycocalicin into two small carbohydrate-poor peptides and into a larger carbohydrate-rich fragment. EACA was able to inhibit plasmin-mediated degradation of glycocalicin in a concentration-dependent fashion. These studies indicated that plasmin degradation of GpIb was due to a direct interaction between plasmin and GpIb and that this effect was mediated by the lysine-binding region of the plasmin molecule.\r"

In this report we describe findings that are not consistent with this mechanism in a patient with nomifensine-induced intravascular IHA associated with renal failure. In vitro studies showed a transitory positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) due to IgG, IgM, and C3 fixation. The causative antibodies were found to be a drug-independent IgM antibody in the serum and eluate that reacted only with E-positive RBC, although the patient's RBC were E-negative; an IgG antibody in the serum and initial eluates that showed a stronger reaction with e-positive than with e-negative or Rhnull RBC, but only in the presence of ex vivo antigen (ie, urine containing the drug and all its metabolites); and an IgM antibody in the serum and initially also on the patient's RBC that, in the presence of ex vivo antigen as well as in the presence of known metabolites of the drug, agglutinated all RBC equally strongly, but was hemolytically more active against E-positive than E-negative cells. Within a few days of stopping the drug the hemolysis rapidly resolved without administration of prednisone, the DAT became negative with anti-IgG and anti-IgM, and the drug-independent anti-E disappeared, but both metabolite-dependent antibodies remained detectable in the patient's serum. We conclude that the production and specificity of the causative antibodies in this case were controlled by a larger antigenic site, presumably consisting of the drug and/or its metabolites plus RBC antigens, rather than by epitopes of the drug or metabolites alone.\r"

In the present study, the electrophoretic mobilities, molecular weights (mol wt), and activities of these PAIs were compared. When fractionated by agarose zone electrophoresis, both PAIs migrated with beta mobility as compared with the mobilities of human plasma/serum proteins. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis, employing agarose zone electrophoresis in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension, indicated that these beta-PAIs comigrated, both having a mol wt of approximately 50,000. The activity of the PAI in endothelial cell-conditioned medium is enhanced severalfold by treatment with either sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine. In preliminary experiments, we were unable to stimulate the PAI activity of undiluted serum by similar treatments. However, the PAI activities in both diluted serum and gel-filtered or electrophoretically fractionated serum were enhanced by treatment with these denaturants. The gel filtration studies also revealed that serum contains multiple forms of the beta-PAI. These forms may represent polymeric PAI and/or complexes between the PAI and other serum components. These findings indicate that the primary PAIs in bovine endothelial cells and human serum are not only immunologically related but are also biochemically similar.\r"

  ".U": "87050051\r", 
  ".W": "Human gamma interferon (HuIFN gamma) was evaluated for its effects on the release from human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (greater than 98% pure) stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) of activities that can stimulate granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies and clusters, erythroid (BFU-E) bursts, and mixed (CFU-GEMM) colonies. T lymphocytes did not release these activities in the absence of PHA with or without HuIFN gamma. In the presence of PHA, pure natural HuIFN gamma at concentrations of 0.1 to 100 U/mL significantly enhanced release of these colony-stimulating activities. Although enhanced release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activities were noted when T lymphocytes were added to the conditioning medium in the presence of 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% PHA, enhanced release of burst-promoting and mixed colony activities was seen only in the presence of 0.1% and 0.5% PHA. The enhanced release of colony-stimulating activities was not due to HuIFN gamma-suppression of the release from PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes of suppressor molecules. The enhancing effects of natural HuIFN gamma were neutralized with a monoclonal anti-natural HuIFN gamma, and recombinant HuIFN gamma mimicked the enhancing effects of the natural HuIFN gamma. This enhancing effect was noted only when HuIFN gamma was added with the T lymphocytes and PHA during the first 24 hours of incubation. T lymphocytes were separated into T4+, T8-, T8+, and T4- subsets (greater than 98% pure for the appropriate phenotypes) after incubation with OKT4- and OKT8- monoclonal antibodies and sorting on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). All types of colony-stimulating activities were released from each population after stimulation with PHA, but enhanced release of these activities in the presence of HuIFN gamma was only detected with the T4+ or T8- subsets of lymphocytes. It cannot be concluded from these studies whether HuIFN gamma is enhancing the release of one or several types of colony-stimulating activities, but these studies suggest a role for HuIFN gamma and T4+ lymphocyte subsets in the regulation in vitro of the release of colony-stimulating activities.\r"

The method is based on the measurement of radioactivity in plasma after administration of 99mTc MDP and 51Cr EDTA, providing an assessment of total skeletal activity independent of renal function. The results showed a significant elevation of skeletal activity in patients with untreated bone metastases when compared with patients with no metastatic spread. Significant elevation with increasing extent of metastases was also shown, the highest activity being in patients with diffuse metastatic spread (superscan). Patients with treated metastatic disease showed significantly lower skeletal activity than patients with untreated bone metastases. The method requires the use of two radiopharmaceuticals injected as a mixture and potential errors may arise from pharmaceutical instability. In addition, elevation of total skeletal activity may be caused by coexistent metabolic bone disease. The results suggest that the measure may provide quantitative information in the assessment of the activity of bone metastases from prostatic carcinoma.\r"

Hypoglycaemic coma was observed less frequently with CSII than with multiple injections and conventional treatment (p less than 0.001), but blood glucose concentrations below 2.5 mmol/l (45 mg/100 ml) were more common. After two years fewer retinal microaneurysms and haemorrhages had developed in the patients given CSII and multiple injections compared with those given conventional treatment, in whom the number had increased significantly (p less than 0.01). Motor nerve conduction velocity deteriorated in the patients given conventional treatment; in those given CSII it was unchanged during the first year but had improved after two years (p less than 0.01). Glomerular hyperfiltration was reduced with CSII, but no change occurred in urine albumin excretion rates. Long term near normoglycaemia may prevent the progression of early stages of late diabetic complications.\r"

Their corrected 1 year survival improved from 7% at 23 weeks to 75% at 28 weeks. The overall incidence of impairment was 19% and of major disability 12%. Boys had a significantly lower normal survival than girls. Multiple births had a significantly lower survival and higher incidence of impairment than singleton births. Predictions of outcome were made before delivery, after resuscitation, and at 1 week to aid the development of guidelines on when perinatal intensive care is justified, whether obstetric intervention for fetal reasons is warranted, and what initial and ongoing prognoses to give to parents. Intensive care for progressively smaller and more immature infants, many of whom were previously considered non-viable, needs to be carefully monitored by every perinatal centre.\r"

The median delay for those patients who showed good rehabilitation at three months was 29 hours, but for those who showed poor rehabilitation it was 57 hours. This difference was significant. It is suggested that a subcapital fracture in an otherwise fit elderly patient should therefore be regarded as a surgical emergency.\r"

A total of 4491 patients fulfilled the entry criteria and were randomly allocated to nifedipine or placebo immediately after assessment in the coronary care unit. Roughly 64% of patients in both treatment groups sustained an acute myocardial infarction. The overall one month fatality rates were 6.3% in the placebo treated group and 6.7% in the nifedipine treated group. Most of the deaths occurred in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and their one month fatality rates were 9.3% for the placebo group and 10.2% for the nifedipine group. These differences were not statistically significant. Subgroup analysis also did not suggest any particular group of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction who might benefit from early nifedipine treatment in the dose studied.\r"

  ".U": "87050644\r", 
  ".W": "The available epidemiological studies of lung cancer and exposure to other people's tobacco smoke, in which exposure was assessed by whether or not a person classified as a non-smoker lived with a smoker, were identified and the results combined. There were 10 case-control studies and three prospective studies. Overall, there was a highly significant 35% increase in the risk of lung cancer among non-smokers living with smokers compared with non-smokers living with non-smokers (relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.54). Part of this increase was almost certainly caused by the misclassification of some smokers as non-smokers. As smokers, who are more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, tend to live with smokers this misclassification probably exaggerated the estimated increase in risk. Adjustment for this error reduced the estimate to 30% (relative risk 1.30), but as people who live with non-smokers may still be exposed to other people's smoke this estimate was revised again to allow for the fact that a truly unexposed reference group was not used. The increase in risk among non-smokers living with smokers compared with a completely unexposed group was thus estimated as 53% (relative risk of 1.53). This analysis, and the fact that non-smokers breathe environmental tobacco smoke, which contains carcinogens, into their lungs and that the generally accepted view is that there is no safe threshold for the effect of carcinogens, leads to the conclusion that breathing other people's tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer. About a third of the cases of lung cancer in non-smokers who live with smokers, and about a quarter of the cases in non-smokers in general, may be attributed to such exposure.\r"

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridisation techniques were used to detect human papillomavirus, which was found in 24 patients (22.6%). In a second group of 104 patients with normal cervical cytology tissue biopsy samples were obtained and examined histologically but in no case was cervical intraepithelial neoplasia found. On DNA hybridisation, however, 12 patients (11.5%) were found to be positive for human papillomavirus. In this group finding human papillomavirus DNA was usually associated with a columnar ectopy. An association between human papillomavirus type 16 DNA and both cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer is well established. In this study it was type 16 which occurred most frequently in both groups.\r"

Twenty infants from a night and day nursery, where the intensity of light and noise was reduced between 7 pm and 7 am, spent longer sleeping and less time feeding and gained more weight than 21 infants from a control nursery, where the intensity of light and noise was not reduced. Differences were significant and became apparent only after discharge home; they were still present three months after the expected date of delivery, when infants from the night and day nursery were an average of 0.5 kg heavier (p less than 0.02). These findings suggest that physical environment has an effect (either direct or indirect) on the subsequent behaviour of preterm infants and that exposure to night and day is beneficial.\r"

On dividing England and Wales into 212 local authority areas a strong geographical relation was found between death rates from chronic bronchitis and emphysema in 1959-78 and infant mortality from bronchitis and pneumonia during 1921-5. It was concluded that this relation provided strong evidence of a direct casual link between acute lower respiratory infection in early childhood and chronic bronchitis in adult life. Regression analysis suggested that infection in early childhood had a greater influence than cigarette smoking in determining the geographical distribution of chronic bronchitis. National time trends reflected the influence of both factors. Chronic air pollution in adult life may be less important a cause of chronic bronchitis than previously supposed.\r"

At the age of 3 years and 2 months he developed severe vomiting and diarrhoea due to cryptosporidiosis, which failed to respond to conventional treatment. Infusion of hyperimmune bovine colostrum produced against parasite antigen, given by nasogastric tube, was started after symptoms had persisted for three weeks. His vomiting and diarrhoea resolved within five days of treatment, and oocysts were no longer seen in the stools after eight days. Later, however, he developed a rare complication, and oocysts were found in the common bile duct. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum may be useful in the treatment of many patients with immunodeficiency disorders.\r"

  ".U": "87050699\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical observations are presented on the sensory effects of lesions of different afferent pathways of the spinal cord, correlated whenever possible with histological evidence of the location and extent of the lesions. They are based on personal cases and on significant cases in the literature, including posterior column section, other causes of damage to the posterior columns, and cases of commissural myelotomy. It is concluded that the traditional view of the effects of lesions of the posterior columns is correct, but that evidence from cases proved by postmortem examination is still needed. When the information normally supplied by the posterior columns is cut off, primary sensibility for light touch and pressure is not lost, but any kind of discrimination is disturbed. There is also a disturbance in knowledge of movement and position, ataxia, and clumsiness in the use of the hands. These defects greatly affect the palpatory examination of objects and, although they may appear slight on routine neurological examination, they can cause severe disturbances in the activities of daily living. For tactile modalities, a lesion of the spinothalamic complex causes minimal or no defects and a lesion of the posterior columns causes only slight defects, whereas a lesion of both pathways gives rise to total loss of tactile and pressure sensibility in the part of the body served by both pathways. This conclusion is based on 2 cases with combined commissural myelotomy and anterolateral cordotomy. The following disturbances of mechanoreception attributed to lesions of the posterior columns are discussed: lability of threshold, persistence of sensation, tactile and postural hallucinations and temporal and spatial disturbances. In man, lesions of the posterior columns cause an increase in pain, tickle, warmth and cold. Cases are presented with and without lesions of the posterolateral columns in conjunction with lesions of one or both anterolateral columns. As these lesions did not affect sensation and as there was no difference in the sensory state following anterolateral cordotomies with or without involvement of the posterolateral column, it is concluded that lesions of this column have no effect on sensation. Cases with lesions of the anterior two-thirds of the cord are also presented to illustrate the sensory state with only the posterior third of the cord intact. In these cases, tactile and pressure sensibility and knowledge of movement and position are normal.\r"

Chronic disease may result from infection with the hepatitis B and D viruses and whatever agent or agents cause hepatitis non-A, non-B, the herpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and human T-lymphotropic virus type III. These diseases have common features, including long-term or even lifetime asymptomatic carriage, viremia, with virus free in the plasma or attached to circulating mononuclear cells, presence of virus in body secretions, irreversible tissue injury in target organs and oncogenic potential. New information on these diseases is reviewed. Other chronic diseases for which the cause is currently unknown may eventually prove to be due to viral infection. In addition, vaccines may be developed for prophylaxis of some chronic viral diseases and associated malignant diseases.\r"

Perioperative mortality is less than 30 percent, and may be further reduced by more-rigorous patient selection. About one-third of the patients can be expected to have good and lasting results, with a return to a fully active and normal life. Life expectancy is not known inasmuch as the longest follow up so far is four-and-a-half years. There are, however, three areas of serious concern: (1) The risk of developing progressive airway damage (obliterative bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis) is high. It occurs in about one-half of the patients surviving surgery and may occur as late as two years after the operation. The pathogenesis of this process is not yet understood, but it may be reversible if detected very early and treated aggressively with corticosteroids; otherwise, it follows a course of steady deterioration. (2) Cyclosporine as a maintenance immunosuppressive drug leads to progressive and irreversible renal impairment. Alternative means of long-term immunosuppression will need to be developed in the future. (3) Graft intimal proliferation affecting both the coronary and the pulmonary vessels may eventually limit graft survival.\r"

However, considerable new data have been derived in the area of limitation of myocardial infarct size. Several studies suggest that the early administration of beta-blockers or intravenous nitroglycerin may benefit patients with acute infarction. We must seriously consider whether the data supporting the use of these agents justify a recommendation that they be used routinely for patients with acute infarction. The role of thrombolytic agents, although widely used already, must also be addressed as data supporting its use build. Additionally, there are suggestive data that the aggressive treatment of hypertension is beneficial, and this approach may well merit advocacy. The prophylactic use of lidocaine and the ubiquitous use of nitrates necessitate reevaluation, although presently both agents are widely used. The aggressive use of electrical therapy for supraventricular arrhythmias and the lack of indication for the treatment of asymptomatic bradycardia with atropine in patients with acute infarction must be added to the previous National Conference standards.\r"

This involves an increase in degradative enzymes that arise from the cartilage. Both proteoglycan- and collagen-degrading enzymes, active at a neutral pH, increase in proportion to the severity of the arthritis until a final end-stage state is reached. This increase in enzyme activity may be triggered by release of a synovial messenger protein similar to interleukin-1. It is suggested by studies in an animal model that inhibition of these enzymes could lead to treatment of osteoarthritis.\r"

  ".W": "A 29 amino acid analog of growth hormone releasing hormone (GH-RH)-40 was given intravenously, subcutaneously, and intranasally to normal men to determine its effectiveness in stimulating growth hormone (GH) release. The GH-RH analog, [Nle27]GH-RH(1-29)-NH2, is an amidated 29 amino acid peptide that has one amino acid substitution at position 27. This peptide stimulates GH secretion when given by the intravenous, subcutaneous, and intranasal routes without adverse effect. The degree of GH stimulation was variable among subjects and the greatest amount of stimulation occurred with the highest doses. GH stimulation occurred in a dose-responsive manner after all three routes of administration. A tenfold higher subcutaneous dose was required to stimulate a comparable amount of GH secretion as compared with intravenous administration, and a thirtyfold higher intranasal than intravenous dose was required to stimulate approximately one fifth the amount of GH release. For comparison, one dose of GH-RH-40, 1 microgram/kg, was administered intravenously. GH secretion after 1 microgram/kg GH-RH-40 and 1 microgram/kg Nle27 GH-RH was comparable between the two groups of subjects. Stimulation of GH secretion by Nle27 GH-RH occurred within 5 minutes of intravenous and within 10 minutes of subcutaneous and intranasal administration; peak GH levels were observed within 30 minutes. GH levels declined and returned to near baseline levels 2 hours after administration of the analog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clearance of CaNa2EDTA significantly correlated with creatinine clearances (CLCR) (r = 0.8373; P = 0.0097). Clearances were decreased in subjects with CLCR less than 70 ml/min as compared with subjects with CLCR greater than 100 ml/min (28 vs. 76 ml/min). Maximum serum CaNa2EDTA concentrations and volume of distribution (Varea) (0.05 to 0.23 L/kg) were similar in all subjects. The Varea is smaller than previously described and is more consistent with other experimental data. Considering all subjects, initial blood Pb concentrations correlated with cumulative urine Pb excretion over 3 days (r = 0.8967; P = 0.0005). Urine Pb excretion did not correlate with measures of renal function or measures of CaNa2EDTA kinetics. Subjects with abnormal CLCR showed significantly greater decreases in blood Pb from day 1 to day 4 (7.0 micrograms/dl vs. 1.2 micrograms/dl) compared with normal subjects. These decreases in blood Pb correlated with CLCR (r = 0.7774; P = 0.138) and urine protein (r = 0.8435; P = 0.0087) but not with urine Pb excretion. Renal dysfunction may alter Pb chelatability, bone-blood Pb reequilibration, PbEDTA distribution, or PbEDTA excretion.\r"

Two groups were studied: one received placebo throughout the entire study (n = 12) and the other received isradipine (n = 12), 2.5 mg b.i.d., for the first week, 5 mg b.i.d. the second week, and 10 mg b.i.d. the third week after an initial 3-week baseline placebo period. Blood pressure was measured approximately 3 hours after dosing. Isradipine, at a total daily dose of 10 mg, lowered average supine diastolic blood pressure 11.8 mm Hg, with only a 3.5 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with baseline. At a total daily dose of 20 mg, average supine diastolic blood pressure decreased 14.8 mm Hg and supine systolic blood pressure declined 13.9 mm Hg; both were significantly decreased compared with placebo or baseline. Heart rate was increased only minimally by isradipine. Renin level activity was increased slightly by isradipine. No serious adverse clinical or laboratory experiences were noted. Isradipine appears to be effective in lowering blood pressure without reflex tachycardia.\r"

When all alpha-ANP concentrations of different anatomical locations and hemodynamic variables were grouped, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure correlated significantly with all alpha-ANP groups, whereas right atrial mean pressure correlated with alpha-ANP levels in pulmonary artery plasma only. Alpha-ANP concentrations were distinctly lower in superior vena cava plasma than in plasma from the right atrium, pulmonary artery, and radial artery. Since alpha-ANP plays an important role in the homeostasis of sodium and fluid balance, measurement of alpha-ANP concentrations, particularly in right atrium, pulmonary artery, or radial artery plasma, might provide valuable information on the status of the critically ill.\r"

BP, blood gases, and acid-base balance were monitored through catheters in the carotid artery and a central vein, as well as in cerebrospinal fluid. Cardiac arrest was induced by a transthoracic direct current shock. CPR was begun immediately by artificial ventilation and simultaneous external chest compressions. Epinephrine was administered after 8 min of CPR. One group (n = 5) of animals received no buffer treatment while another (n = 5) received an infusion of 75 mmol sodium bicarbonate and a third group (n = 5) received an equivalent amount of tris-buffer mixture. The results of these experiments, as well as previously described circulatory variables during CPR, were analyzed using a computer model describing the CO2 kinetics of the pig. Our main finding was that PaCO2 was positively correlated to cardiac output during CPR; improved cardiac output during CPR resulted in more efficient tissue CO2 elimination and was associated with increased survival rates. PaCO2 was also somewhat reduced by efficient alveolar hyperventilation. The arterial PCO2 and pH did not reflect the acid-base balance in peripheral tissues. During CPR, bicarbonate and tris-buffer mixture both quickly passed through the blood-brain barrier. When buffer treatment is indicated during CPR, a buffer which does not increase tissue PCO2 may be the drug of choice.\r"

The first two sets of patients had bacteria isolated from usually sterile sites (blood and lung), while the latter harbored repeatedly isolated organisms not usually felt to be part of the normal respiratory flora. Mixed infection may help explain the substantial mortality still seen from pneumonia. This is especially true if Legionella, mycobacteria, or Nocardia species are encountered where routine smears and cultures may not aid in the diagnosis. Poor clinical response to specific antibacterial therapy in pneumonia should trigger further investigation for other potential pathogens.\r"

Fingertip and ear oximeters provide measurement of oxygen saturation in arterial blood under most conditions, but accuracy is lost when intense peripheral vasoconstriction is present. Transcutaneous and conjunctival O2 and CO2 sensors also function as accurate trend monitors of PaO2 and PaCO2 in the hemodynamically stable patient. Measurement of pH by placement of a sensor into the subcutaneous tissue provides a continuous assessment of arterial pH in neonates with normal CO, but the use of these sensors in adult patients remains largely unproven. Noninvasive assessment of the adequacy of peripheral perfusion, cardiac function, and intravascular volume status can be performed using transcutaneous or conjunctival O2 and CO2 sensors. Early detection and correction of hypovolemia and diminished CO can be accomplished by monitoring tissue PO2 and PCO2. In the emergency department setting, in which the evaluation and initial treatment of critically ill patients often is performed by measurement of a limited set of physiologic parameters, the ability to evaluate tissue perfusion on a continuous basis is an important clinical advance.\r"

Estrogen stimulated the synthesis and release of pituitary PRL in both sexes of normal and hpg mice, and this marked increase in PRL synthesis correlated with an equally dramatic increase in pituitary PRL mRNA levels. Administration of GnRH alone produced a slight but significant increase in pituitary PRL content, which is consistent with an action of GnRH on prolactotropes, either directly or by way of a paracrine action involving gonadotropes.\r"

  ".U": "87053551\r", 
  ".W": "The precise roles of the calcium and lipid pathways in TRH-stimulated PRL secretion from rat pituitary (GH3) cells are controversial. In particular, it is debated whether elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) is sufficient to cause burst secretion (0-2 min) or whether an increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol must accompany the Ca2+ elevation. In this study, the effects of TRH, which elevates 1,2-diacylglycerol, on [Ca2+]i and stimulation of burst secretion were compared with those of depolarization by high extracellular K+, which does not increase 1,2-diacylglycerol. A maximal concentration of TRH (1 microM) and depolarization by 17.5 mM K+ caused elevation of [Ca2+]i from the resting level of 140 +/- 20 nM to 470 +/- 70 nM and 514 +/- 60 nM, respectively, and stimulated burst secretion from 0.6 +/- 0.2 ng/10(6) cells/min to 3.3 +/- 0.8 and 3.1 +/- 0.4 ng/10(6) cells/min, respectively, when a small component of TRH-stimulated secretion that is independent of elevation of [Ca2+]i was subtracted. A detailed comparison of multiple levels to which [Ca2+]i was elevated (up to 600 nM) and the degree of stimulation of burst phase secretion demonstrated the same positive linear correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.96) for TRH and K+ depolarization. Hence, elevation of [Ca2+]i is sufficient to cause burst secretion irrespective of elevation of 1,2-diacylglycerol. Optimal stimulation by TRH of sustained secretion of PRL did not depend on elevation of [Ca2+]i; sustained PRL secretion stimulated by 10 nM TRH was 2.6 +/- 0.4 and 2.7 +/- 0.2 ng/10(6) cells/min in control cells and arachidonic acid-pretreated cells in which [Ca2+]i was not elevated, respectively. The data from this and previous studies demonstrate that elevation of [Ca2+]i and 1,2-diacylglycerol may act coordinately, but not synergistically, to mediate TRH stimulation of PRL secretion from GH3 cells.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiological properties of cultured bovine anterior pituitary cells were examined using intracellular recordings. Although all cells had high input resistances (mean 332 M omega), membrane potentials (Vm) showed a wide distribution (-32 to -80 mV). In 9 cells with low Vm (mean -38 mV) spontaneous Ca2+-dependent action potentials were observed (mean frequency 3.4 hertz). In the majority of silent cells (mean Vm -58 mV), application of TRH caused a reduction in membrane resistance and a transient hyperpolarization of Vm. This initial response was followed by a small, sustained depolarization. In 4/18 cells this depolarization led to the appearance of action potentials in previously silent cells. In 15/18 cells application of dopamine caused an increase in the membrane conductance and led to a sustained hyperpolarization of 30-35 mV. The response reversibly blocked the propagation of action potentials in spontaneously active cells. This effect could also be reversed by the dopamine receptor antagonists, sulpiride and haloperidol. In all cells, elevating the extracellular potassium concentration caused a concentration-dependent depolarization and decrease in the membrane input resistance. In some cells this effect was associated with an increased frequency of action potentials. Electrophysiological responses to TRH, dopamine, and elevated potassium were correlated with changes in the release of PRL. It is concluded that by their effects on Vm these factors modulate spontaneous electrical properties and may regulate the entry of calcium necessary for hormone secretion from lactotrophs.\r"

  ".W": "The perifusion technique was used to investigate the action of diazepam (DZ), a benzodiazepine molecule known to compete for TRH receptor binding in rat pituitary, on TRH-induced TSH and GH release. The release kinetics for the two hormones from quartered pituitaries were measured in response to a 6-min pulse of TRH (10 nM), without or with DZ addition for a period of 30 min before and during the TRH pulse, plus an additional 15-min period. The dynamic patterns of TSH and GH release in response to TRH were characterized by a rapid increase in hormone release, declining slowly over the next 20 min. The rate of release represented 2.98 +/- 0.02 (+/- SE) and 1.75 +/- 0.06 times the corresponding basal level for TSH and GH, respectively, when evaluated over the first 15 min of the response to TRH. Addition of increasing doses of DZ suppressed the stimulatory effect of TRH in a dose-related manner, with an ID50 of 3 nM for both TSH and GH. The maximal effect of DZ was obtained with a concentration of 10 nM for both hormones. Ro 15-1788 (100 nM), a selective antagonist of the central type of benzodiazepine-binding sites (added to the perifusion system 30 min before DZ and then during the whole period of DZ perifusion), completely abolished (P less than 0.01) the inhibitory effect of DZ (10 nM) on the TRH-induced TSH and GH responses. When added alone before the TRH pulse, Ro 15-1788 had no effect on the TSH response to TRH. In contrast, PK 11,195 (100 nM), a selective antagonist of the nonneuronal benzodiazepine-binding sites, was unable to abolish the inhibitory action of DZ on TRH-stimulated TSH release. In addition, the effects of four other types of benzodiazepine (flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, midazolam, and medazepam), all tested at a 10-nM concentration, corroborated these findings. Furthermore, DZ inhibition of the TSH response was nullified by picrotoxin (1 microM), but not by bicuculline (1 microM), two gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonists that had no effect, by themselves, on this response. For comparison, the effect of DZ (10 nM) was also tested on the release of GH in response to human GH-releasing factor-(1-44)-NH2 (10 nM) and was found to be ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A continuous cell line derived from rat liver (ARL 15) has been identified that responds to thyroid hormone with a stimulation of active Na,K transport. Stimulation of ouabain-inhibitable K+ uptake, which is half-maximal at a T3 concentration of 1.4 X 10(-10) M, is accompanied by corresponding increases in passive Na+ influx and in passive K+ efflux. The enhancement of Na+ and K+ fluxes by T3 is shown to be accompanied by smaller and equivalent increases both in enzymatically measured Na,K-ATPase activity and in maximal ouabain-sensitive Na,K transport in the presence of the Na+ ionophore monensin. The demonstration that both passive Na+ influx and passive fractional K+ efflux are simultaneously increased by T3 supports the earlier suggestion that the stimulation of active Na,K transport by thyroid hormone is attributable, at least in part, to an enhancement of rate-limiting passive Na+ and K+ fluxes by an increase in membrane permeability.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulation of gonadotropin release from pituitary cell cultures by GnRH has been linked to inositol phospholipid breakdown to diacylglycerols and subsequent activation of protein kinase C as well as Ca2+ mobilization. In order to examine the means of receptor coupling to a phospholipase C-type reaction, we evaluated the role of guanine nucleotides in inositol phospholipid breakdown. In these studies ATP (50 microM) was used for cell permeabilization to allow guanine nucleotides access to the intracellular compartment. Under these conditions GTP and the GTP analog, guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP), stimulated a time- and dose-dependent increase in LH release and inositol phosphate accumulation. These actions of GTP and GMP-PNP were not observed unless ATP was included in the treatment media. Other closely related nucleotides and nucleosides alone, or in the presence of ATP, did not elevate LH release above basal levels. We also evaluated the actions of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin on mediating the effect of GTP, GMP-PNP, and GnRH on LH release and inositol phosphate accumulation. After treatment with these agents, no changes were observed in the ability of GnRH, GTP, or GMP-PNP to stimulate either LH release or inositol phosphate accumulation. The additional observation that GnRH-, GTP-, or GMP-PNP-stimulated LH release and inositol phosphate accumulation were blocked by a potent GnRH antagonist suggests that a G protein is functionally associated with the GnRH receptor recognition site.\r"

VIP (4.0 micrograms/100 g BW) caused a reduction in the high energy metabolite phosphocreatine and an increase in inorganic phosphate. In the same experiments (n = 9), VIP stimulated PRL secretion to a value of 146% +/- 13 of basal concentrations. The change in the inorganic phosphate-phosphocreatinine ratio had a positive correlation with the increase in PRL secretion (P less than 0.001), indicating a VIP-induced energy consumption for a process related to PRL secretion. In separate experiments, in vitro, it was confirmed that VIP increased energy consumption by demonstrating an increase in glycogenolysis by the pituitary tumor cells. TRH also increased PRL secretion to 145% +/- 23 of basal values but, in contrast, did not induce changes in energy metabolites detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance. It is concluded that VIP and TRH promote PRL release through different stages in the secretion process.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to ovariectomized rats resulted in changes in the forward angle light scatter (FALS) and perpendicular light scatter (PLS) signals of anterior pituitary lobe cells. One day after steroid treatment some cells showed increases in PLS signals to an intermediate ridge position lying between the two ridges seen for cells prepared from oil-treated ovariectomized rats. Over the first 5 days of E2 treatment, the major effect was a progressive increase in the FALS signal of cells in this intermediate ridge position. Increases in PLS signals continued over the 12-day treatment period. Since the results of a cell sorting experiment showed that PRL cells predominated in the intermediate scatter ridge, it was concluded that E2 increases both size (FALS) and secretory granule content (PLS) of mammotrophs. Cells in the low and high scatter regions were unaffected by E2. Those in the low scatter region were shown, by both electron microscopy and light microscopic immunochemistry, to be enriched in agranular, unstained endothelial-follicular cells. The high-scatter region contained predominantly GH cells. Administration of E2 to pituitary cells cultured in serum-free or serum-containing media for 1-12 days had no effect on the FALS-PLS bivariate distribution. However, the light scatter ridges produced from cells in culture were compressed into a single ridge of narrow PLS and broad FALS signal intensity with increasing time in culture.\r"

The ionophore A23187 inhibits secretion in toxin-treated as well as in control cells. We conclude that a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein is involved in calcium regulation of PTH secretion at a locus proximal to the intracellular site effecting inhibition of secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal regulation of inhibin production by cultured granulosa cells from immature hypophysectomized, estrogen-treated rats was examined using a specific RIA which detects the N-terminal portion of the inhibin alpha-chain. The RIA measured bioactive inhibin of Mr about 32,000 in granulosa cell conditioned media fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography. In the presence of 10(-7) M androstenedione, FSH stimulated inhibin production in a dose-dependent manner during a 2-day culture. Inclusion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor decreased the EC50 for FSH from 2.6 to 0.8 ng/ml (n = 3). The stimulatory effect of FSH could be mimicked with forskolin (an adenyl cyclase activator) and with a cAMP analog, (Bu)2cAMP, consistent with FSH action mediated through a cAMP dependent pathway. Intracellular levels of inhibin were unmeasureable, suggesting that inhibin is not stored to any great extent by the granulosa cells. This finding was consistent with in vivo studies which showed that whereas FSH treatment for 2 days doubled serum inhibin levels when compared with basal levels, there was no increase in the concentration of extractable inhibin in ovarian tissue. Granulosa cells which had been exposed to 20 ng/ml FSH for 2 days to induce LH receptors produced inhibin in response to both LH and human CG during the subsequent 2-day culture, with the levels of inhibin equalling the amount inducible by FSH. In contrast, neither PRL nor terbutaline, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, had any effect on inhibin production even though receptors for these hormones are also induced by FSH. GnRH was found to inhibit the FSH-stimulated production of inhibin (IC50, 10(-7) M), consistent with previous observations that GnRH can act at the ovarian level to inhibit granulosa cell differentiation. This inhibition by GnRH could be reversed by inclusion of a specific GnRH antagonist. On the other hand, another regulatory peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, slightly stimulated inhibin production. The effect of several growth factors was also tested. Insulin-like growth factor I raised not only FSH-stimulated inhibin levels, but basal levels as well. Insulin was also effective, but only at 100-fold higher concentration. Epidermal growth factor inhibited FSH-stimulated inhibin production (IC50 = 0.1 ng/ml), whereas fibroblast growth factor had no effect. Thus, granulosa cell inhibin secretion is regulated by FSH and LH but not by PRL, presumably via a cAMP-mediated pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The carbohydrate components of combined alpha-subunits of urinary hCG and human pituitary LH (hLH), FSH (hFSH), and TSH (hTSH), each derived from the intact hormone, were studied by direct sugar analysis and methylation analysis. The methods provide a complete survey of the structural elements contained in the complex sugars associated with these glycoproteins, but do not establish the sugar sequences or anomeric configurations of glycosidic bonds. By analogy to N-linked oligosaccharides that occur in many glycoproteins, the data suggest distinct structural features for carbohydrates of alpha-subunits combined with beta-subunits. hCG alpha contains biantennary asparagine-linked chains terminated by either NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1- or GlcNAc beta 1-2 Man alpha 1- and lacks fucose. hTSH alpha contains biantennary chains with the same termini as hCG alpha plus terminal R-O-4GalNAc and a fucosyl residue linked alpha 1-6 to the inner GlcNAc residue of the N-linked chitobiosyl core. hLH alpha may contain some high mannose chains, but primarily contains biantennary chains terminated by NeuAc alpha 2-3(6)Gal beta 1-, GlcNAc beta 1-, GalNac-1-, R'-O-6GlcNAc-1-, and R\"-0-2Man-1-plus a fucosyl residue linked alpha 1-6 to the inner GlcNAc residue of the N-linked chitobiosyl core. hFSH alpha contains more complicated structures that probably include a bisecting GlcNAc residue linked beta 1-4 to a 3,6-di-O-substituted core mannosyl residue, and terminal NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(+/- Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc-1, Gal beta 1-4(+/- Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc-1-, R\"'-O-GalNAc-1-, and GalNAc-1. In addition, the presence of 2,4-di-O-substituted mannose in hFSH alpha indicates that it contains triantennary chains. The identities of the R; R', R\", and R\"' groups were not determined, but recent studies of glycoprotein hormones suggest that they may be sulfate groups. Our results demonstrate differential glycosylation of virtually identical polypeptide hormone alpha-subunits produced in the same organ or perhaps even in the same cell.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of continuous stimulation of opiate receptors with morphine (M) on the negative feedback effects of testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on LH and FSH secretion was studied in rats that had been castrated 2 weeks previously. In the absence of gonadal steroids, 4 days of continuous M exposure did not alter LH or FSH levels. Similarly, Silastic capsules containing crystalline T (5 mm) or E2 [5 mm long (75 micrograms E2/ml) to 7.5 mm long (300 micrograms E2/ml)] alone had little effect on LH or FSH release. However, in M-exposed rats, T reduced serum LH by greater than 90%, and E2 reduced LH by more than 75%. Among the doses of DHT evaluated, only the highest dose (7.5-mm Silastic capsules packed with crystalline DHT) reduced LH secretion, and M exposure only slightly enhanced this suppression. M or gonadal steroids alone produced little change in FSH levels in castrated rats. However, the combination of M plus E2 or DHT further reduced FSH levels. Evaluation of pituitary responses to LHRH revealed that when administered alone, T did not alter, DHT reduced, and E2 enhanced the LH response to the decapeptide. Neither M treatment alone nor M plus T or DHT altered the pituitary LH response to LHRH. On the other hand, M appeared to enhance the stimulatory effects of E2 on pituitary responsiveness to LHRH. These findings suggest that the interaction of M and gonadal steroids at the level of the pituitary could not explain the observed marked suppression of gonadotropin secretion by suboptimal T or E2 during opiate receptor stimulation with M. Collectively, these observations are in accord with the view that endogenous opioid peptides may play a role in modulating the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to the negative feedback effects of gonadal steroids.\r"

  ".U": "87053595\r", 
  ".W": "The present experiments were designed to determine the effects of different activators of protein kinase C on the secretion of LHRH from median eminence nerve terminals incubated in vitro. The release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a metabolite of arachidonic acid intimately involved in the secretion of LHRH, was also evaluated. Synthetic diacylglycerol [1,2-didecanoylglycerol (DiC10)] significantly enhanced PGE2 release in a concentration-dependent manner. Blockade of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity nullified this effect. LHRH release, on the other hand, was not increased by DiC10. However, in the presence of a lipoxygenase inhibitor, DiC10 produced a concentration-related increase in LHRH release, which paralleled that in PGE2. Phospholipase C (PLC) increased both PGE2 and LHRH secretion. Again, blockade of the lipoxygenase pathway enhanced the release of LHRH by PLC without affecting the stimulated secretion of PGE2. A phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), markedly increased LHRH secretion while inducing a modest increase in PGE2 release. Both effects of PDBu were unaffected by lipoxygenase inhibition. DiC10, PDBu, and PLC significantly augmented LHRH secretion from tissues in which metabolism of arachidonic acid had been prevented by inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C, independent of PLA2 activation, can lead to the secretion of this neural peptide. Some lipoxygenase metabolites had either no effect on [5- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (5- and 15-HETE)] or induced a marginal stimulation of (12-HETE) LHRH release. At certain concentrations, 12-HETE enhanced the stimulatory effect of the phorbol ester on LHRH release. Our results suggest that activation of protein kinase C can stimulate LHRH secretion from nerve terminals in vitro and, further, that diacylglycerol may represent an important intracellular messenger participating in the events leading to LHRH secretion. In addition, stimulation with DiC10 and PLC uncovered inhibitory [unknown arachidonic acid metabolite(s) via lipoxygenase] and stimulatory (PGE2 via cyclooxygenase) pathways through with arachidonic acid metabolites may participate in the intracellular transduction of signals modulating neural peptide secretion.\r"

The confinement of the immunofluorescence in the conspicuous mitochondria allowed the design of a very sensitive and quantitative assay to study the modulated expression of the cytochrome in primary cultures of granulosa cells. (1) The induction of P-450scc synthesis was totally dependent upon treatment with FSH. Up to 85% of the cells became immunofluorescently labeled in the presence of FSH, and its induced P-450scc synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide and alpha-amanitin. The induction of FSH was dose dependent (Kmapp = 35 ng/ml) and time dependent. Prolonged incubation with FSH maintained the high levels of the cytochrome content, despite a desensitized steroidogenic response which developed after 60 h of incubation with FSH. Prolonged FSH treatment also resulted in morphological changes in the induced mitochondria, which became fragmented and globular. (2) Inoculum densities, probably by altering cell shape, substantially affected the extent of P-450scc induction; this was suppressed (80%) at lower culture densities. (3) The immunofluorescent staining also revealed various degrees of cellular competence to express P-450scc. Within a single induced cell, all mitochondria emitted a similar fluorescent signal, but the degree of fluorescence per mitochondrion varied with different cells. The cell-specific information gained by the immunofluorescent technique also allowed the detection of ovarian interstitial cells that slightly contaminate the granulosa cell preparations. Unlike granulosa cells, interstitial cells express and maintain high levels of P-450scc without the need for hormonal induction.\r"

FSH stimulated stages VIIcd to XI of the cycle; similar results were obtained with (BU)2cAMP. RA stimulated PA secretion in stages I-VIIab, but testosterone and insulin had no effect in any stage. The secreted PA was mainly of the urokinase type, although small amounts of the tissue-type PA were found after stimulation by FSH and cAMP. These results suggest that spermatogenic cells modify the responsiveness of Sertoli cells to hormonal stimulation.

Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IPs) formed by hydrolysis of PIs was measured in cells that had been preloaded with [3H]myo-inositol. GnRH stimulated both LH release and incorporation of [3H]inositol into total [3H]IPs with similar dose and time dependencies. [3H] IP production in response to GnRH could be blocked by a GnRH antagonist, but was stimulated by a compound that provokes receptor microaggregation. GnRH-stimulated IP production persisted in the presence of either the Ca2+ channel blocker D600 or the calmodulin antagonist pimozide at concentrations that reduced LH release to 60% and 20% of control, respectively. Stimulated [3H]IP production was inhibited at higher concentrations of D600. In 1-h incubations, GnRH-stimulated [3H]IP production, but not LH release, was markedly inhibited by the protein kinase C activators phorbol myristate acetate and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. These findings indicate that in the gonadotrope, GnRH-stimulated LH release and [3H]IP production are closely coupled to receptor activation by an agonist; Ca2+ antagonists uncouple stimulated LH release from [3H]IP production; and protein kinase C activators uncouple stimulated PI turnover from LH release. Thus, GnRH-stimulated production of PI metabolites, as measured by [3H]IP accumulation, is apparently not sufficient to support LH release in the absence of Ca2+. In addition, GnRH-stimulated LH release is apparently not dependent on full expression of the PI response.\r"

As a step toward understanding the mechanism of action of Ca2+ on the parathyroid, we examined hyperplastic human parathyroid tissue for Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. In parathyroid homogenates, Ca2+ stimulates the phosphorylation of substrate protein in the presence of calmodulin or phospholipid. The calmodulin (CaM)-stimulated activity is present in a soluble fraction of parathyroid and can be separated from other protein kinase activities by gel filtration chromatography. The concentration dependence of CaM kinase on Ca2+ and CaM was determined using the gel filtration. The Ka values for CaM and calcium were 100 nM and 5 microM, respectively. The fraction containing the CaM kinase activity had a calculated mol wt of 5.5 X 10(5). It contained a protein with a mol wt of 4.9 X 10(4) whose phosphorylation was Ca2+ CaM dependent and a CaM-binding protein of mol wt 4.9 X 10(4) which we suggest may be the catalytic subunit of a type II Ca2+-CaM dependent protein kinase. Hyperplastic human parathyroid tissue contains a type II Ca2+-CaM dependent protein kinase which may serve an important function in Ca2+-directed metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of atrial natriuretic factors (ANFs) on anterior pituitary hormone secretion and cyclic nucleotide production were investigated in cultured rat pituitary cells. ANF had no effect on ACTH, GH, PRL, and TSH release or on cAMP production either on basal hormone levels or during stimulation of their secretion by the appropriate releasing factor. However, ANF markedly stimulated cGMP production in both mixed anterior pituitary cells and enriched anterior pituitary cell populations fractionated by centrifugal elutriation. Unexpectedly, certain ANF preparations, Bachem rat ANF-(5-28) and rat ANF-(5-25), markedly stimulated LH release from cultured anterior pituitary cells and gonadotroph-enriched elutriated pituitary cells. The same ANFs also displaced [125I-D-Lys6]GnRH ethylamide from binding to anterior pituitary membranes with potencies similar to their LH-releasing activities. Immunoprecipitation of ANF with a specific antiserum abolished the effect of ANF on cGMP production, but did not change the effect of ANF on LH release. In conclusion, ANF did not affect anterior pituitary hormone secretion or cAMP production, but stimulated cGMP formation. The effect of certain ANF preparations on LH release appears to be attributable to peptide contamination with a potent GnRH agonist.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have described modulation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion by atrial stretch, increased Na+ concentration, and a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters. One problem in the study of ANF secretion has been the isolation of stimulatory effects from interference due to rhythmic myocardial contraction. To avoid this problem, rat atria were dispersed, the myocytes were suspended in a polyacrylamide gel matrix, and the resulting cell column was perifused with a physiological buffer. The secretion of ANF immunoactivity was markedly stimulated by increases in extracellular osmolality, regardless of the solute (NaCl, KCl, or glucose). This effect did not require extracellular Ca2+, nor could it be mimicked by depolarizing concentrations of K+ in an isotonic medium. Functional viability of this model was demonstrated by significant dose-related increases in ANF release in response to as little as 1 nM epinephrine. The dissociation of ANF secretion from depolarization-induced changes in Ca2+ flux is unusual and may represent an adaptation to the dual roles of the atrial myocyte, contraction and secretion.\r"

  ".U": "87053621\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have established the ovarian granulosa cell as a site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secretion and action, suggesting an autocrine function for this peptide in the ovary. To better understand how this putative autocrine system is regulated and its interface with the classic ovarian trophic hormones FSH, LH, and estradiol (E2), we have studied the effects of these hormones on the secretion of immunoreactive IGF-I (iIGF-I) by cultured porcine granulosa cells. Immature granulosa cells were cultured under serum-free conditions which were optimized to allow maximal iIGF-I production and hormonal responsivity. Measurements of iIGF-I were made after minimizing the influence of IGF-binding proteins by either acid gel filtration or reverse phase chromatography. Since the two preparative procedures gave roughly comparable results, the more expeditious reverse phase procedure was chosen for most samples. Cycloheximide virtually eliminated measurable iIGF-I in culture, suggesting that the peptide measured was newly synthesized, and degradation of IGF-I by cultured granulosa cells was negligible. Consequently, the medium levels provided an accurate indication of cellular secretion over the collection period. Under optimal culture conditions, iIGF-I was readily measurable and responsive to treatment with ovarian trophic hormones. The iIGF-I levels in several experiments with these hormones were as follows: FSH treatment, 1.58 +/- 0.21 times the control value (n = 5 experiments); E2 treatment, 1.26 +/- 0.12 times the control value (n = 5); E2 plus FSH, 3.12 X 0.31 times the control value (n = 8); LH, 1.33 +/- 0.12 times the control value (n = 3); LH plus FSH, 1.78 +/- 0.2 times the control value (n = 1). To assess the role of cAMP in the mediation of gonadotropin effects in this system, granulosa cells were treated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (methylisobutylxanthine), which resulted in iIGF-I levels 1.61 +/- 0.7 times the control level. In the presence of FSH, a further stimulatory effect was demonstrated (3.76 +/- 0.29 times control). In addition, the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP dramatically increased iIGF-I levels (6.3 +/- 0.72 times control). These data provide the first demonstration that gonadal iIGF-I secretion can be stimulated by the principal hormones involved in trophic regulation of the ovary. As with other gonadotropin-dependent functions of granulosa cells, this effect appears to be mediated by cAMP and enhanced by E2. This interface between circulating hormones and autocrine systems could provide an important mechanism to amplify the effects of gonadotropic hormones on a local level.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of pituitary cell cultures to GnRH causes gonadotropin release, receptor capping, internalization, and loss as well as altered responsiveness of the target cell. In the present study, the relationship between loss of gonadotrope secretory responsiveness to GnRH (desensitization) and internalization of the GnRH-receptor complex was examined. Pituitary cell cultures were pretreated (30 min) with vinblastine (100 microM, a concentration that prevents measurable receptor internalization) or with medium containing carrier only, incubated with 10(-7) M GnRH (a desensitizing concentration) with or without vinblastine or with medium alone for 60 min, and finally washed and rechallenged for 3 h with increasing concentrations of GnRH to assess the degree of desensitization as determined by LH release. Results indicate that vinblastine had no measurable effect on the ability of GnRH to stimulate LH release or desensitize the cells. In a second series of studies, a GnRH analog (D-Lys6-GnRH) was immobilized to a cross-linked agarose matrix. The covalent link was shown to be stable by biological, immunological, and physical criteria. This product bound to the GnRH receptor and provoked LH release, but was not internalized, as determined by GnRH receptor binding assays. Cultured cells were treated with either 10(-9) M free analog or an equivalent concentration of coupled analog (as measured by LH release) for 3 h. Cells were washed, then rechallenged with GnRH to assess desensitization. Both the free and coupled analogs provoked an equivalent degree of desensitization. While a significant degree of desensitization also occurred in the presence of 3 mM EGTA (conditions that totally inhibited GnRH-stimulated LH release), the loss of responsiveness was not as great as in the absence of EGTA, indicating that partial depletion of available LH may play a role in GnRH-stimulated gonadotrope desensitization. The present findings suggest that GnRH receptor internalization and LH release can be uncoupled and that loss of the GnRH receptor by internalization is not a sufficient explanation for GnRH-mediated desensitization of the gonadotrope.\r"

This study was designed to reveal early hormonal and histological changes on day 1 of the estrous cycle (estrus) in SP-treated animals and changes brought about by the SP-induced acyclic condition. Groups of 8-10 animals were killed on day 1 after 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 days of SP treatment; sera and pituitaries were saved for hormone determinations, and ovaries were prepared for histological analysis. Intraatrial cannulae were inserted into anovulatory animals, and blood samples were withdrawn on the first and second postoperative days; the animals were killed on the third postoperative day. PRL levels were significantly reduced in cycling animals after 16 days of SP exposure and diminished further in acyclic animals. Pituitary PRL did not change in cycling animals, although it was highly depressed in SP-treated acyclic animals. The estrous FSH surge, serum LH levels, and pituitary gonadotropin contents were not affected by SP in cycling animals; in anovulatory animals, pituitary gonadotropin contents were significantly increased, and daily afternoon gonadotropin surges were observed. Uterine weights were reduced in cycling animals and underwent a further reduction after cyclicity ceased. Ovarian analysis revealed that all cycling animals had the same number of recruited follicles, yet significantly fewer corpora lutea and an apparent increase in atretic antral follicles were observed after 16 days of SP exposure. These results suggest that SP-induced cessation of estrous cyclicity occurs abruptly. SP does not alter the secondary FSH surge, but might adversely affect maintenance of follicular growth and depress serum PRL levels.\r"

The present investigation was undertaken to examine the possible existence of an autoregulatory mechanism for LHRH. In the first experiment, long term ovariectomized rats bearing lateral ventricular and atrial cannulae received intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of saline or LHRH every hour from 1200-1500 h. Blood was collected at 10-min intervals from 1200-1500 h to assess the effects of icv LHRH on pulsatile LH and FSH release. After the 1500 h collection, LHRH was injected iv and blood was collected to determine the effects of icv LHRH on pituitary responsiveness to LHRH. Central injections of 0.1 pg and 1 ng LHRH, but not 10 pg LHRH, significantly suppressed mean LH levels, trough LH levels, and LH pulse frequency compared to those in saline-treated control rats. The amplitude of LH pulses was not significantly affected by any dose of LHRH. In contrast to LH, multiple icv injections of LHRH failed to alter pulsatile FSH release. Pituitary LH and FSH responses to iv LHRH injection were not suppressed by icv LHRH. In a second experiment, hourly icv injections of 1 ng LHRH into proestrous rats markedly suppressed preovulatory LH release only during the middle to latter phases of the surge. In a final study using an in vitro superfusion system, addition of a LHRH agonist to the superfusion medium at a concentration that does not cross-react in the LHRH RIA suppressed basal and K+-stimulated LHRH release from medial basal hypothalamic fragments, but not from median eminence explants. These results support the existence and operation of an autoregulatory mechanism for LHRH in the central nervous system which may participate in the control of episodic LHRH release in ovariectomized rats and preovulatory LHRH release in proestrous rats. Seemingly, ultrashort-loop negative feedback regulation of LHRH requires the presence of structures other than nerve terminals in the MBH (i.e. cell bodies).\r"

Dexamethasone (Dex), added to the culture medium, enhanced the secretory response to Epi. Aggregates of pituitary cells separated by gradient sedimentation at unit gravity widely differed in responsiveness to Epi, provided Dex was added to the culture medium. The poorest response was seen in aggregates composed of a population highly enriched in large somatotrophs from adult male rats even when cultured in the presence of 80 nM Dex. However, when these large somatotrophs were coaggregated with various somatotroph-poor cell populations, all of which were enriched in lactotrophs, the GH response to Epi increased by a factor of 3-4. The latter populations also enhanced GH secretion stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (1-10 nM). In contrast, the GH response to rat GH-releasing factor (GRF, 0.01-0.1 nM) was not significantly potentiated in the coaggregates. The facilitation of the GH response to Epi was not seen when Dex was omitted from the culture medium. All of the lactotroph-enriched populations enhancing the response to Epi also contained corticotrophs, but none were highly enriched in the latter cell type. The magnitude of the Epi effect on GH release was not affected when the large somatotrophs were coaggregated with enriched populations of gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, or folliculostellate cells. However, coaggregation with GH3 tumor cells provoked some stimulation. The present data suggest that GH release stimulated by Epi is modulated by facilitatory interactions of somatotrophs with other cells, the latter being most likely lactotrophs, although participation of corticotrophs in this interactions cannot be unequivocally excluded. Facilitatory interactions also modulate GH secretion in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide, but the GH response to GRF weakly, if at all.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the regulation of adrenal sensitivity to angiotensin II (AII) was investigated in vivo and in vitro by analyzing the characteristics of the inhibitory effect of ANF on aldosterone production stimulated by AII and other stimuli. In isolated adrenal glomerulosa cells, ANF caused a dose-dependent inhibition of basal and stimulated aldosterone production by submaximal concentrations of ACTH, AII, and potassium, with an ED50 of about 1 nM for ANF and complete inhibition with 10 nM ANF. ANF increased the ED50 for ACTH from 14.6 +/- 3.2 to 376 +/- 104 pM with no significant decrease in the maximum aldosterone response. In contrast, ANF inhibited the aldosterone responses to all doses of AII, decreasing maximal aldosterone production by 75%, with a small increase in the ED50 for AII. In conscious rats, ANF infusion (100 ng/min) markedly decreased the plasma aldosterone response to AII infusion (5-10 ng/min). With higher AII doses (50 and 100 ng/min), which increased plasma corticosterone (and presumably ACTH secretion), the inhibitory effect of ANF was less marked. When the rise in ACTH secretion was prevented by dexamethasone treatment, ANF decreased the aldosterone response to 100 ng/min AII by 85%. Similarly, ANF had a minor although significant inhibitory effect on the primary ACTH-mediated increases in plasma aldosterone after stress by immobilization for 15 min. The data demonstrate a prominent inhibitory effect of ANF on AII-stimulated aldosterone production in vivo and in vitro. Since plasma ANF levels are increased during atrial distension, these observations support a regulatory role of ANF in the control of the adrenal sensitivity to AII during alterations of extracellular volume.\r"

In contrast, GH release induced by prostaglandin E2 (5 micrograms/100 g BW, iv) was not affected by the antiserum. SRIF-14 (5 micrograms/rat, icv) also raised plasma GH levels in conscious rats during the constant iv infusion of SRIF-14 (55 ng/55 microliter X min) which suppressed spontaneous GH secretion. Neither plasma TSH levels nor TSH release induced by a TRH analog were affected by icv injection of SRIF-14.

Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate the presence of transferrin mRNA in liver and Sertoli cells. Transferrin mRNA levels were measured in total RNA isolated from cultured rat Sertoli cells after treatment with FSH, insulin, retinol, and testosterone. The results showed a 2- to 4-fold increase in the level of transferrin mRNA, which peaked on the fourth day of culture after initiation of treatment, with FSH, insulin, retinol, and testosterone. This induction is gene specific, since no change in the mRNA levels for either the catalytic or regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was observed. The effects of hormones, vitamin A (retinol), and Bu2 cAMP on transferrin mRNA and transferrin secretion (measured by RIA) in cultured Sertoli cells were compared. In general, a direct relationship between the amount of transferrin mRNA present in the cells and the amount of transferrin secreted into the culture medium was observed.

In the present investigation we examined whether this action was mediated by other neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Studies using receptor blockers for dopamine (pimozide), alpha-adrenergic receptors (phentolamine), and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (atropine) revealed that these receptor blockers, at a dose of 10(-6) M, which was capable of blocking the response to the relevant transmitter in previous studies, had no effect on basal release of SRIF in the static incubation system and failed to modify the response to GRF (10(-10) M). On the other hand, the opiate receptor blocker naloxone at a dose of 10(-6) M, although failing to alter basal release, completely blocked the response to 10(-10) M GRF. To determine the opioid peptide involved in mediating the SRIF release induced by GRF, highly specific antibodies directed against beta-endorphin were added to the in vitro incubation system. These antibodies significantly depressed basal release SRIF and completely blocked the response to 10(-10) M GRF. Incubations in the presence of normal rabbit serum or highly specific antiserum directed against alpha MSH had no effect on either basal release of SRIF or that induced by GRF. These results suggest that in this incubation system there is a beta-endorphin tone which is partially responsible for the basal release of SRIF and that the stimulation of SRIF release induced by GRF is mediated via beta-endorphin terminals, which presumably synapse on the terminals of the somatostatinergic neurons in the median eminence fragment.\r"

After 48 h in culture, the basal cellular content consisted predominantly of spermine (1.1 nmol/mg protein) with substantially lower amounts of spermidine (0.1 nmol/mg protein) and undetectable amounts of putrescine. Upon the addition of ovine FSH (3 X 10(-9) M), cellular spermine content became significantly elevated above the control value as early as 1 h after treatment, reaching a 2.5-fold stimulation by 4 h. Spermidine was also elevated by 4 h after FSH treatment, but remained less than 20% of the spermine concentration. At no time did the cellular content of putrescine increase to measurable levels. Extended time-course studies demonstrated that the FSH-induced cellular increase in spermine and spermidine content persisted up to 24 h during the continuous presence of FSH. Bu2cAMP (5 mM) invoked similar changes in PA levels when measured at 4, 8, and 24 h. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, which catalyzes the production of putrescine, was increased by FSH in a temporal fashion similar to that of spermine production. Addition of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, blocked increases in both ODC activity and PA in cells stimulated with FSH or Bu2cAMP. Pulse-chase experiments using [3H]ornithine demonstrate that putrescine is initially synthesized, and is subsequently converted to spermidine and spermine. These studies suggest that regulation of PA biosynthesis by FSH is largely expressed as increases in spermine, and to a lesser extent spermidine, suggesting that the more complex PAs may be involved in the regulation of Sertoli cell function.\r"

On the basis of both affinity cross-linking experiments and competition binding experiments, H-35 cells display insulin and type II IGF receptors, but not type I IGF receptors. IGF-II and multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA; the rat homolog of IGF-II) stimulate tyrosine aminotransferase, amino acid transport, and glycogen synthase activities to the same magnitude as insulin. However, MSA and IGF-II stimulate these metabolic responses only at high concentrations, indicating that these peptides are acting through the insulin receptor. Incubation of H-35 cells with MSA also induces a state of unresponsiveness to the further actions of both MSA and insulin. There is no associated loss of either insulin or IGF-II binding, indicating that desensitization occurs at a postbinding step in hormone action. The high concentration of MSA necessary to induce desensitization is also consistent with MSA acting through the insulin receptor. We conclude that in H-35 cells, the insulin receptor, rather than the type II IGF receptor, mediates the metabolic responses stimulated by MSA and IGF-II as well as the MSA-induced desensitization to insulin and MSA action.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments tested the ability of the hypothalamus of old male rats to release LHRH in vitro. Mediobasal hypothalami (MBH) of 18-month-old and 6-month-old male rats were perfused for a total of 5 h and 5 min; the amounts of LHRH released, both in basal conditions and after stimulation with high extracellular K+ (110 mM, applied for 5 min every 30 min), were measured in the effluent. Our results show that the basal secretion of LHRH from the perfused MBH of young and old male rats is quantitatively similar. Moreover, the MBHs of young and old animals are capable of responding to the repeated administration of a K+ stimulus with repeated bursts of LHRH hypersecretion. From a quantitative point of view, the MBHs of old animals respond to the K+ stimulus in a fashion similar to that found in younger animals; even if the responses to K+ of the hypothalami of old animals appear to be somewhat lower than those of the hypothalami of younger animals, the differences recorded were not significant. LHRH content (as measured by RIA) of the MBH before the perfusion period was similar in young and old animals. At the end of the experiment, the content of LHRH of the perfused hypothalamus was not significantly different in the old and young groups. Serum and intrapituitary levels of LH and FSH were significantly lower in 18-month than in 6-month-old animals. These data suggest that the alterations of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal complex observed in aged male rats are not due to an intrinsic age-related defect of LHRH-synthesizing neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Although vitamin E has been recognized as a requirement for normal testicular function for more than 50 yr, the functional role of this fat soluble vitamin in the maintenance of spermatogenesis has not been clarified. Vitamin E deficiency has a deleterious effect on germ cell proliferation and differentiation in the rat and a variety of other animal species. The potential effect of vitamin E on the sensitivity of the hypothalmo-hypophyseal-gonadal feedback system has not been previously evaluated. Therefore, serum testosterone concentrations, androgen function in maintaining seminal vesicle weight, and citrate synthesis, as well as the circulating amounts of FSH, were determined in rats fed semipurified diets with vitamin E, control, and without vitamin E, vitamin E-deficient. To assess dietary effects before, during, and after testicular degeneration, analyses were carried out on animals fed the diets starting at 3 weeks of age and continuing for 1 yr. The defect produced by vitamin E deficiency does not reflect impaired gonadotropin function. There are no effects of vitamin E deprivation on either serum levels of testosterone or on seminal vesicle weight and citrate content suggesting that the LH-testosterone feedback loop is not impaired. The feedback loop of FSH and inhibin also appears to be normal. Serum FSH concentrations are not elevated, although the testis is germ cell depleted. Comparison of the vitamin E-deficient model to other models of testicular degeneration suggests that the effect of vitamin E occurs directly or indirectly on the regulation of intratesticular factors which regulate specific steps of germ cell development.\r"

Determination of seizure thresholds in this strain showed that both female and male AE mice had electroconvulsive thresholds that were markedly lower than those of other strains of mice, whereas susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol was not increased. The antiepileptic drug phenobarbital was much less effective in blocking electroconvulsions in AE mice than in other strains. Similarly, valproic acid was less effective in protecting against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These differences in anticonvulsant efficacy could be explained only partly by differences in pharmacokinetics, thus indicating a lower responsiveness of AE mice to antiepileptic drugs. Determination of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic decarboxylase in different brain regions showed no significant difference between AE mice and normal NMRI mice except for a lower GAD activity in corpus striatum of male AE mice. The data indicate that AE mice may be an interesting new genetic model of epilepsy.\r"

The incidence of anovulation and LUF in the endometriosis population was 9% and 34%, respectively. In group I, 10 of 36 patients (27.8%) conceived, with an average of 17.6 induction cycles per pregnancy. In group II, 21 of 30 patients (70%) conceived, with an average of 4.5 cycles per pregnancy (difference significant at P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the average number of ovulation induction cycles per patient between groups I and II (4.9 and 3.1, respectively). Of 14 patients who did not conceive in group I and crossed over to group II, 9 (64.3%) conceived (not different from group II). Spontaneous abortion rates were 20% in group I and 14% in group II.

A better responder rate to BCPT therapy was observed in patients with apparent (88.9%) or borderline (69.2%) exaggerated responses of PRL to TRH than in normal patients (41.7%). Further, in patients with normal PRL responses, the inappropriately enhanced LH responses were seen in BCPT responders but not in nonresponders.

The patients received 37 courses of treatment with dosages of hMG ranging from 1200 IU (16 ampules) to 8400 IU (112 ampules), followed by the administration of 5000 or 10,000 IU of the hybrid hCG. Of the total number of courses given, 75.5% were ovulatory; serum progesterone levels at midluteal phase of the cycle were within normal range, and the cycle length was about 12 days. Seven patients became pregnant, three with twins, one with triplets, and three with aborted single fetuses. Before the hybrid hCG was administered the serum estrogen levels were less than 1200 pg/ml in 12 cycles (32.4%), and the estrogen levels ranged from 1400 to 7400 pg/ml in 25 (67.6%). However, in spite of high estrogen levels, clinical hyperstimulation, which occurred in 22.4% of previous treatments with conventional hMG-commercial hCG, did not develop when the hybrid hCG was administered, an effect which could be attributed to its short circulatory half-life. Studies are in progress to confirm whether the hybrid hCG may provide a better margin of safety than commercial hCG for ovulation induction in patients pretreated with hMG.\r"

Semen analyses were done, baseline serum testosterone and gonadotropin levels tested and the gonadotropin response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) measured. The infertile men with varicoceles exhibited lower sperm counts, abnormal sperm morphologic features, increased baseline serum gonadotropins, and increased gonadotropin responses to LH-RH, compared with the normal fertile men. The fertile men with varicoceles showed similar abnormalities, although this was not statistically significant in all cases. That semen and hormone abnormalities were observed in both the fertile and infertile men with varicoceles suggests that the presence of a varicocele is associated with some degree of primary testicular dysfunction, regardless of present fertility status.\r"

Elevated basal serum levels of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids were demonstrated. Serum pregnenolone (P5) was 3.0 ng/ml, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) 3245 ng/ml. Basal serum levels of delta 4 steroids were low or within normal limits. Serum progesterone (P) was 0.5 ng/ml, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) 0.2 ng/ml, androstenedione (delta 4A) 0.4 ng/ml, and testosterone (T) 0.1 ng/ml. All delta 5/delta 4 steroid ratios were elevated. Dexamethasone (DEX) administration normalized the elevated levels of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids, whereas delta 4-3-ketometabolites exhibited only minor modifications. The DHEA-S/delta 4A ratio increased more than five times over the basal ratio, and P5/P and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OHP5)/17-OHP ratios did not increase after adrenocorticotrophic hormone ACTH stimulation. Studies of basal ovarian function revealed 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and gonadotropins within normal limits according to the menstrual cycle. In the follicular phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 101.3 ng/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) 46.0 ng/ml, and E2 49.7 pg/ml; in the luteal phase, FSH was 180.0 ng/ml, LH 69.3 ng/ml, and E2 50.1 pg/ml. The presence of ovulatory cycles was documented on the basis of the biphasic pattern of the basal body temperature cycles and the increment in P levels. This case demonstrates the existence of normal ovulatory function in a woman with late-onset of a mild form of HSD.\r"

Fourteen women underwent laparotomy in the late follicular phase for gynecologic reasons; 6 were treated with sulpiride daily from the midfollicular to the late follicular phase (sulpiride group) and 8 received no treatment (control group). Daily administration of sulpiride (150 mg orally) significantly elevated serum prolactin (PRL) levels in all six women. In the small follicles (less than or equal to 8 mm in diameter), follicular fluid 17 beta-estradiol (E2) concentration was significantly lower (P less than 0.01), and testosterone (T) concentration was higher (P less than 0.05) in the sulpiride group. In the large follicles (greater than or equal to 9 mm in diameter), however, follicular fluid E2 and T concentrations showed no significant differences between the sulpiride and control groups. In the sulpiride group, the mean diameters of the follicles were significantly smaller than in the control group (P less than 0.01). These observations suggest that PRL exerts a suppressive effect on the smaller but not the larger follicles during the late follicular phase.\r"

Ovulation was based on pregnancy and/or elevated luteal progesterone values. There were no significant differences between the two treatment regimens, based on E2 levels, follicular size, and/or number of follicles greater than 1.0 cm. Pregnancy and ovulation occurred more frequently after intramuscular hMG therapy.

PCOD was defined as oligomenorrhea elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), normal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and preference-elevated androgens. Luteinizing-releasing hormone (LRH) was administered intravenously via a portable infusion pump. Doses varied between 5 and 40 micrograms/pulse given at 60-, 90-, or 120-minute intervals. In 11 women, 85 treatment units (TUs) were completed, of which 74 were ovulatory, showing no specific advantage of any particular pulse dose or pulse interval. Five pregnancies occurred in three women. Two women did not ovulate during 52 and 284 consecutive days of therapy, respectively. Oligomenorrheic patients with PCOD can be made more regular by means of LRH, not necessarily leading to a regular menstrual cycle. In general, LRH is sufficient for luteal support. No signs of hyperstimulation were observed, although two patients incidently developed unilocular cysts with a maximum diameter of 8 cm. Ovulation induction with LRH in PCOD is possible, although the disease itself does not change during therapy. This may be further evidence that altered hypothalamic LRH secretion is more the result, rather than the cause, of the phenomenon of PCOD.\r"

The data were analyzed with the use of two-way analyses of variance (F-test), paired t-test, and Page's test. At 0 hour, compared with baseline, significant increases were observed in the plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol (F), free T index (T/SHBG), and prolactin (PRL). At 1 hour, levels of these steroid hormones and PRL declined, some significantly. At 4 hours, levels of all hormones except DHEA-S returned to baseline. No significant changes were observed in concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), as evaluated by F-test.

In contrast, the nonvegetarian group did not show significant reduction of LH, E2, and P values during any part of the menstrual cycle. Seven of nine women in the nonvegetarian diet group maintained ovulatory cycles with no changes in cycle length or in the length of the follicular phase.

  ".W": "Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) and clomiphene citrate (CC), either alone or in combination, are frequently used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an attempt to maximize the number of oocytes recovered and the number of embryos transferred. However, direct comparison of the relative efficacy of these protocols in the same institution has been limited. To evaluate this question, the authors examined the outcome of 304 consecutive women attempting IVF. One hundred eighty-one women received hMG, 42 received CC, and 81 received combination hMG/CC. The percentages of women undergoing laparoscopy were not different among the groups (69%, 71%, and 74%, respectively), nor were the rates of oocyte recovery (94%, 100%, and 100%). However, the percentage of women achieving oocyte fertilization (77%, 83%, and 93%) and embryo transfer (73%, 83%, and 90%) were significantly greater among those who had received hMG/CC stimulation. A comparison of hMG/CC with hMG and CC cycles revealed a statistically significant increase in the total number of developing follicles (4.5 +/- 0.3, 3.3 +/- 0.2, and 3.1 +/- 0.3, respectively; P = 0.0137), total oocytes recovered (4.1 +/- 0.3, 3.2 +/- 0.2, and 2.5 +/- 0.2; P = 0.0011), and embryos transferred (2.2 +/- 0.2, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 1.4 +/- 0.2; P = 0.0013). However, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of ongoing pregnancies. Thus, in terms of the per-patient number of follicles, oocytes, and embryo transfers, combined hMG/CC stimulation appears to be superior to either hMG or CC alone. However, to date the combined regimen has not improved pregnancy rates.\r"

At the time of the onset of the luteinizing hormone surge (LH), the size of the leading follicle did not differ significantly between the spontaneous and the stimulated cycles, although it was larger in the CC/FSH cycles. During the two days before the LH surge onset, the growth rate was faster in the stimulated than the spontaneous cycles. It is suggested that despite the provocation of extremely high plasma-estradiol levels and multiple follicular development, the leading follicle in stimulated cycles ovulated at a size equal to or greater than that in spontaneous cycles. The reason for the higher follicle size in the CC/FSH cycles is, as yet, unclear.\r"

Four patients with massive loss of intestine, 4-10 mo after initiation of parenteral nutrition, began to develop progressive, marked increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (2-10 times normal), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (7-20 times normal), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (5-14 times normal) activity levels, and bilirubin concentration (5-22 times normal). Light microscopic examination of liver showed cholestasis, bile ductular proliferation, periportal inflammation, fibrosis, and mild steatosis. Electron microscopic examination of liver showed cholestasis with nonspecific organelle changes. None of the patients had any evidence of extrahepatic obstruction.

To assess the role the kidneys play in the radiation-induced increase in iTxB2 excretion, an in situ isolated perfused rat kidney model was developed. The excretion rate of iTxB2 from irradiated isolated perfused kidneys was not significantly different from sham-irradiated perfused kidneys. Radiation exposure did alter renal cyclooxygenase product release in that the excretion of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (iPG2) and immunoreactive 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in irradiated isolated perfused kidneys. These data show that radiation-induced increases in iTxB2 excretion are primarily due to altered extrarenal synthesis and/or metabolism of this arachidonate metabolite.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of antigen aerosol challenge on the airways of the canine peripheral lung and examined the roles of cyclooxygenase products, histamine, and cholinergic activity in the responses. One-minute deliveries of 1:10,000 or 1:100,000 concentrations of Ascaris suum antigen aerosol through a wedged bronchoscope resulted in mean maximal increases in collateral system resistance (Rcs) of 415 and 177%, respectively, after 4-8 min. Repeated antigen challenge (1:100,000) resulted in significantly decreased responsiveness to antigen after the initial exposure (P less than 0.005). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the isolated, challenged segment had a significant increase in mean (+/- SE) prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) concentration vs. control (222.0 +/- 65.3 vs. 72.7 +/- 19.5 pg/ml; P less than 0.05); histamine concentrations were variable and not significantly different (4.1 +/- 2.6 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml; P greater than 0.05). In nine experiments, cyclooxygenase inhibition significantly attenuated the antigen-induced increase in Rcs by 53.4% (P less than 0.001), and the concentration of PGD2 in lavage fluid was reduced by 96.0% (P less than 0.01). Blockade of histamine H1-receptors (n = 8) or cholinergic receptors (n = 7) did not significantly affect the airway response (P greater than 0.05). These data indicate that the canine peripheral lung responds in a dose-dependent manner to antigen aerosol challenge and exhibits characteristics of antigen tachyphylaxis. Results also suggest that cyclooxygenase products play a central role in the acute bronchoconstrictive response of the lung periphery.\r"

To test whether such neural section removes sensitivity to hypoxia, we measured respiratory, cardiovascular, and blood gas responses to hypoxia at 84-, 70-, and 49-Torr inspiratory O2 partial pressure (PIO2) in five pigeons with intact vagi and in five bilaterally, cervically vagotomized pigeons. Normoxic respiratory frequency (fresp) and expiratory flow rate (VE) were decreased after vagotomy. Intact pigeons showed large increases in VE in response to hypoxia, effected mostly by increases in fresp. VE also increased greatly in response to hypoxia in vagotomized pigeons, but increases were largely the result of tidal volume. O2 consumption, CO2 production, and respiratory exchange ratio increased slightly in all pigeons during hypoxia. Normoxic heart rate was greater after vagotomy; cardiac output increased in all pigeons in response to hypoxia, but stroke volume increased only in intact pigeons. During normoxia, arterial and mixed venous O2 partial pressure, O2 concentration, and pH were lower and arterial and mixed venous CO2 partial pressure was higher, after vagotomy. In all pigeons during hypoxia, arterial and mixed venous O2 and CO2 partial pressure and O2 concentration decreased and arterial and mixed venous pH increased; changes were roughly parallel in intact and vagotomized pigeons. The arteriovenous O2 concentration differences during normoxia and hypoxia were similar in all pigeons. We conclude that bilateral, cervical vagotomy in the pigeon causes hypoventilation and tachycardia during normoxia, but strong respiratory and cardiovascular responses to hypoxia are still present.\r"

  ".W": "Infants with respiratory failure are frequently mechanically ventilated at rates exceeding 60 breaths/min. We analyzed the effect of ventilatory rates of 30, 60, and 90 breaths/min (inspiratory times of 0.6, 0.3, and 0.2 s, respectively) on the pressure-flow relationships of the lungs of anesthetized paralyzed rabbits after saline lavage. Tidal volume and functional residual capacity were maintained constant. We computed effective inspiratory and expiratory resistance and compliance of the lungs by dividing changes in transpulmonary pressure into resistive and elastic components with a multiple linear regression. We found that mean pulmonary resistance was lower at higher ventilatory rates, while pulmonary compliance was independent of ventilatory rate. The transpulmonary pressure developed by the ventilator during inspiration approximated a linear ramp. Gas flow became constant and the pressure-volume relationship linear during the last portion of inspiration. Even at a ventilatory rate of 90 breaths/min, 28-56% of the tidal volume was delivered with a constant inspiratory flow. Our findings are consistent with the model of Bates et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 58: 1840-1848, 1985), wherein the distribution of gas flow within the lungs depends predominantly on resistive factors while inspiratory flow is increasing, and on elastic factors while inspiratory flow is constant. This dynamic behavior of the surfactant-depleted lungs suggests that, even with very short inspiratory times, distribution of gas flow within the lungs is in large part determined by elastic factors. Unless the inspiratory time is further shortened, gas flow may be directed to areas of increased resistance, resulting in hyperinflation and barotrauma.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of chemical and reflex drives on the postinspiratory inspiratory activity (PIIA) of phrenic motoneurons using a single-fiber technique. Action potentials from \"single\" fibers were recorded from the C5 phrenic root together with contralateral mass phrenic activity (also from C5) in anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats with intact vagus and carotid sinus nerves. Nerve fibers were classified as \"early\" or \"late\" based on their onset of discharge in relation to mass phrenic activity during hyperoxic ventilation. Only the early fibers displayed PIIA but not the late fibers, even when their activity began earlier in inspiration with increased chemical drives. Isocapnic hypoxia increased, whereas hyperoxic hypercapnia shortened the duration of PIIA. Pulmonary stretch and \"irritant\" receptors inhibited PIIA. Hypercapnia and stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors by lobeline excited both early and late units to the same extent, but hypoxic ventilation had a less marked excitatory effect on late fiber activity. Irritant receptor activation increased the activity of early more than late fibers. Hyperoxic hyperventilation eliminated late phrenic fiber activity, whereas early fibers became tonically active. Bilateral vagotomy abolished this sustained discharge in eight of nine early units, suggesting the importance of vagal afferents in producing tonic firing during hyperventilation. These results suggest that early and late phrenic fibers have different responses to chemical stimuli and to vagally mediated reflexes; late units do not discharge in postinspiratory period, whereas early fibers do; the PIIA is not affected in the same way by various chemical and vagal inputs; and early units that exhibit PIIA display tonic activity with hyperoxic hypocapnia.\r"

Multipoint pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots were constructed during normoxia in conscious dogs by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. The effects of ANG II infusion (60 ng X kg-1 X min-1, iv) and CEI with captopril (1 mg/kg plus 1 mg X kg-1 X h-1, iv) on pulmonary vascular P/Q plots were assessed first with the conscious dogs intact and again after combined administration of pharmacological antagonists to block sympathetic alpha- and beta-adrenergic, cholinergic, and arginine vasopressin receptors. In intact dogs, ANG II increased (P less than 0.01) the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PAP-PCWP) over the entire range of Q studied (60-120 ml X min-1 X kg-1). Conversely, CEI decreased (P less than 0.05) PAP-PCWP at each level of Q. After administration of the autonomic nervous system and arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, ANG II again increased (P less than 0.01) and CEI decreased (P less than 0.01) PAP-PCWP over the entire range of Q studied. Thus exogenous administration of ANG II results in active, nonflow-dependent constriction of the pulmonary circulation, and this effect is not dependent on the autonomic nervous system or increased circulating levels of arginine vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Arterial blood gas tensions, pH, and hemoglobin concentrations were measured in four free-diving Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddelli. A microprocessor-controlled sampling system enabled us to obtain 24 single and 31 serial aortic blood samples. The arterial O2 tension (PaO2) at rest [78 +/- 13 (SD) Torr] increased with diving compression to a maximum measured value of 232 Torr and then rapidly decreased to 25-35 Torr. The lowest diving PaO2 we measured was 18 Torr just before the seal surfaced from a 27-min dive. A consistent increase of arterial hemoglobin concentrations from 15.1 +/- 1.10 to 22.4 +/- 1.41 g/100 ml (dives less than 17 min) and to 25.4 +/- 0.79 g/100 ml (dives greater than 17 min) occurred during each dive. We suggest that an extension of the sympathetic outflow of the diving reflex possibly caused profound contraction of the Weddell seal's very large spleen (0.89% of body wt at autopsy), although we have no direct evidence. This contraction may have injected large quantities of red blood cells (2/3 of the total) into the seal's central circulation during diving and allowed arterial O2 content to remain constant for the first 15-18 min of long dives. The increase of arterial CO2 tensions during the dive and the compression increase of arterial N2 tensions were also moderated by injecting red blood cells sequestered at ambient pressure. After each dive circulating red blood cells are oxygenated and rapidly sequestered, possibly in the spleen during the first 15 min of recovery.\r"

Compared with a previously reported standard indirect calorimetry system, the new device had by virtue of longer duration of measurement improved precision (coefficient of variation 3% vs. 14%) during studies of O2 consumption both at room temperature and at 5 degrees C. In addition, a more physiological atmospheric environment is maintained. This system has also been utilized for simultaneously labeling groups of up to 20 weanling rats with 18O2 over a 2-day period and for exposure of rats to a hyperoxic (84% O2), normobaric environment for 4-day periods. Potential applications include maintenance of pressure (hypobaric through hyperbaric) and O2 (hypoxic through hyperoxic) controlled environments, exposure to toxic gases, study of diurnal variations in metabolic rate, measurement of metabolic expenditure with activity, and adaptation to other species including humans.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the importance of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamines in early postnatal lung growth. Lung-ODC activity in newborn rats rose rapidly after birth and was highest at 4-6 days of age. Lung putrescine and spermidine specific contents also peaked during this period, but spermine specific content remained relatively unchanged. The temporal pattern of these changes differed markedly from that in the heart, brain, and kidney where ODC activity is highest at birth then rapidly declines. The period of peak lung-ODC activity and polyamine specific content correlated with rapid increases in lung DNA content, protein content, and weight. The specific irreversible ODC inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, significantly reduced lung-ODC activity and putrescine and spermidine specific content; it also caused significant early reductions in lung DNA and protein content without simultaneously affecting body weight and appearance. Morphometrically, the lungs of alpha-difluoromethylornithine-treated rats had significantly fewer type 2 epithelial cells, interstitial cells, and capillary endothelial cells than the lungs of controls. We conclude that ODC and polyamines play an important role in postnatal lung growth and that alpha-difluoromethylornithine can be used as a probe to disrupt lung growth.\r"

Immersion should almost cancel the effects of gravity on systemic circulation and should leave the lung alone to gravitational influence. During steady-state breathing we measured ventilation, O2 consumption (VO2), CO2 production, end-tidal PCO2 (PACO2), and heart frequency (fH). Using CO2 rebreathing techniques, we measured cardiac output, functional residual capacity, equivalent lung tissue volume, and mixed venous O2 content, and we calculated arterial PCO2 (PaCO2). As Gz increased, ventilation, fH, and VO2 rose markedly, and PACO2 and PaCO2 decreased greatly in dry ride, but during immersion these variables changed very little in the same direction. Functional residual capacity was lower during immersion and decreased in both the dry and immersed states as Gz increased, probably reflecting closure effects. Cardiac output decreased as Gz increased in dry rides and was elevated and unaffected by Gz during immersion. We conclude that most of the changes we observed during acceleration are due to the effect on the systemic circulation, rather than to the effect on the lung itself.\r"

We used the multiple inert gas elimination technique to compare gas exchange during exercise under normobaric hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.11, PB = 760 Torr, PIO2 = 80 Torr) with earlier hypobaric measurements. Mixed expired and arterial respiratory and inert gas tensions, cardiac output, heart rate (HR), minute ventilation, respiratory rate (RR), and blood temperature were recorded at rest and during steady-state exercise in 10 normal subjects in the following order: rest, air; rest, 11% O2; light exercise (75 W), 11% O2; intermediate exercise (150 W), 11% O2; heavy exercise (greater than 200 W), 11% O2; heavy exercise, 100% O2 and then air; and rest 20 minutes postexercise, air. VA/Q inequality increased significantly during hypoxic exercise [mean log standard deviation of perfusion (logSDQ) = 0.42 +/- 0.03 (rest) and 0.67 +/- 0.09 (at 2.3 l/min O2 consumption), P less than 0.01]. VA/Q inequality was improved by relief of hypoxia (logSDQ = 0.51 +/- 0.04 and 0.48 +/- 0.02 for 100% O2 and air breathing, respectively).

It ranged from 1.3 to 2.4 cm3 X s-1 X Torr-1 X g-1 X 10(-4) in control lungs. Pulmonary arterial injection of AA (100 microM; in presence of 20 microM indomethacin to suppress pulmonary arterial pressure rise) during an acute hydrostatic challenge, but not at zero venous pressure, caused a greater than 10-fold increase in Kf,C. Vascular compliance was not altered. Additional experiments, performed under zero-flow conditions to avoid any ambiguity in microvascular pressure, corroborated the severalfold increase in vascular permeability, detectable within 3 min after AA application during acute hydrostatic challenge.\r"

The release of leukotriene induced by A23187 (78 +/- 11 pmol leukotriene D4 equivalent/10(7) parenchymal lung cells) was unchanged during hypoxia and was significantly reduced (55.4 +/- 7.7% control leukotriene release) during anoxia, whereas A23187-induced histamine release (63.2 +/- 4.2% total cell histamine) was unaffected by reduced oxygenation. Reduction of final buffer pH from 7.4 to 7.0 did not affect mediator release. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of the released leukotrienes revealed a mixture of leukotrienes C4 and D4, with a symmetrical reduction in product during anoxia. Although leukotriene release in response to hypoxia was not demonstrated, the findings do not preclude limited local release of leukotrienes, perhaps in association with increased smooth muscle responsiveness.\r"

Pulmonary arterial, left atrial and systemic arterial pressures, cardiac output, arterial blood gases, and pH were measured at base line and biweekly following radiation. Pulmonary vasoreactivity to 12% O2, 100% O2, and an analogue of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2-A) was also assessed. Five nonirradiated sheep served as controls. By the 2nd wk following irradiation, pulmonary vascular resistance had doubled. Final pulmonary arterial pressure was increased 50% over the base-line value (base line = 14 +/- 1 cm H2O; final 22 +/- 2; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.05). Arterial PO2 was decreased to approximately 70 Torr throughout the study. In addition, pulmonary vasoreactivity to PGH2-A, but not to breathing 12 or 100% O2, was significantly increased above base line in the irradiated animals (P less than 0.05). Morphometric techniques applied to the lungs in which the pulmonary arterial circulation was distended with barium gelatin mixture, showed extension of muscle into the distal intra-acinar arteries, and a reduction in both the external diameter and the number of barium-filled peripheral arteries in the irradiated animals. Thus thoracic irradiation results in functional and structural changes of chronic pulmonary hypertension and increased pulmonary vasoreactivity to PGH2-A. The structural changes in the peripheral pulmonary arterial bed may contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular reactivity following thoracic irradiation.\r"

The effect of Paw on PaCO2 and PaO2 was the same at 3, 6, and 9 Hz. Alveolar ventilation (VA), calculated from VCO2 and PaCO2, significantly decreased by 22.7 +/- 2.6 and 40.1 +/- 2.6% after Paw was increased to 5 and 10 cmH2O, respectively. By taking into account the changes in anatomic dead space (VD) with lung volume, VA at different levels of Paw fits the gas transport relationship for HFV derived previously: VA = 0.13 (VT/VD)1.2 VTf (J. Appl. Physiol. 60: 1025-1030, 1986). We conclude that increasing Paw and lung volume significantly decreases gas transport during HFV and that this effect is due to the concomitant increase of the volume of conducting airways.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the increase in inspiratory flow rate caused by a decrease in the inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio (I:E) at a constant tidal volume (VT) could increase the efficiency of ventilation in high-frequency ventilation (HFV). To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of changing I:E from 1:1 to 1:4 on steady-state alveolar ventilation (VA) at a given VT and frequency (f) and at a constant mean lung volume (VL). In nine anesthetized, paralyzed, supine dogs, HFV was performed at 3, 6, and 9 Hz with a ventilator that delivered constant inspiratory and expiratory flow rates. Mean airway pressure was adjusted so that VL was maintained at a level equivalent to that of resting FRC. At each f and one of the I:E chosen at random, VT was adjusted to obtain a eucapnic steady state [arterial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) = 37 +/- 3 Torr]. After 10 min of each HFV, PaCO2, arterial pressure of O2 (PaO2), and CO2 production (VCO2) were measured, and I:E was changed before repeating the run with the same f and VT. VA was calculated from the ratio of VCO2 and PaCO2. We found that the change of I:E from 1:1 to 1:4 had no significant effects on PaCO2, PaO2, and VA at any of the frequencies studied. We conclude, therefore, that the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for gas transport during HFV must be insensitive to the changes in inspiratory and expiratory flow rates over the VT-f range covered in our experiments.\r"

To accomplish this, O2 consumption (VO2) arterial blood gases and acid-base status, arterial lactate concentration ([LA-]a), and rectal temperature (Tr) were measured in 27 chronically instrumented dogs at rest, during different levels of submaximal exercise, and during maximal exercise on a motor-driven treadmill. During mild exercise [35% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2 max)], PaCO2 decreased 5.3 +/- 0.4 Torr and resulted in a respiratory alkalosis (delta pHa = +0.029 +/- 0.005). Arterial PO2 (PaO2) increased 5.9 +/- 1.5 Torr and Tr increased 0.5 +/- 0.1 degree C. As the exercise levels progressed from mild to moderate exercise (64% of VO2 max) the magnitude of the hypocapnia and the resultant respiratory alkalosis remained unchanged as PaCO2 remained 5.9 +/- 0.7 Torr below and delta pHa remained 0.029 +/- 0.008 above resting values. When the exercise work rate was increased to elicit VO2 max (96 +/- 2 ml X kg-1 X min-1) the amount of hypocapnia again remained unchanged from submaximal exercise levels and PaCO2 remained 6.0 +/- 0.6 Torr below resting values; however, this response occurred despite continued increases in Tr (delta Tr = 1.7 +/- 0.1 degree C), significant increases in [LA-]a (delta [LA-]a = 2.5 +/- 0.4), and a resultant metabolic acidosis (delta pHa = -0.031 +/- 0.011). The dog, like other nonhuman vertebrates, responded to mild and moderate steady-state exercise with a significant hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was demonstrated that treatment with 2,000 rads of radiation that was initiated within four days after the total hip arthroplasty was highly effective in the prevention of heterotopic ossification and in the prevention of recurrence after resection of existing ossification. In the present study, 1,000 rads of radiation was administered in increments of 200 rads over a period of five to seven days and was as effective as treatment with 2,000 rads.

Serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, LH, FSH, PRL, and cortisol concentrations were measured during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Waist to hip ratio and abdominal fat cell size were measured at the beginning of the study. The serum levels of E2 (P less than 0.04) as well as those of A, SHBG, and LH (P less than 0.002) were lower in the obese group. Consequently, the testosterone to SHBG ratio and the E1 to A ratio were higher and the LH to FSH ratio was lower in this group. Waist to hip ratio did not correlate with the levels of circulating hormones or SHBG, but an inverse correlation was found between abdominal fat cell size and A as well as the LH to FSH ratio in the nonhirsute women of the obese group. Subsequent to moderate weight reduction (13.2 kg), serum A and E1 levels (P less than 0.01) increased, and serum cortisol levels decreased (P less than 0.001). Thus, massive obesity is associated with abnormalities in hormonal balance in gynecologically symptomless women, there being an association between E1, E2, A, LH, cortisol, and relative weight and/or abdominal fat cell size.\r"

  ".U": "87057933\r", 
  ".W": "Preovulatory ovarian secretion of progesterone (P4), several hours before the onset of the typical midcycle gonadotropin surge, occurs in humans and monkeys. We investigated the potentially obligatory role of preovulatory P4 secretion in stimulating the midcycle LH surge by administering a potent P4 antagonist, RU 486(17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-[4-dimethylaminophenyl-1]17 alpha-[prop-1-ynyl]estra-4,9-dien-3-one), to sexually mature, normally ovulatory cynomolgus monkeys on days 10-12 of the menstrual cycle (n = 18). Monkeys were randomized to receive RU 486 alone (5 mg/day, im; group I); RU 486 plus dexamethasone (1 mg/day, im; group II); dexamethasone alone (group III); or vehicle (ethanol; 0.5 ml; group IV). Before drug treatment, the follicular phases were quite similar among groups. The administration of RU 486 blocked (delayed) the expected gonadotropin surge, despite rising estrogen concentrations (greater than 250 pg/ml). The expected LH surge was delayed by RU 486 (n = 5) or RU 486 with dexamethasone (n = 3) until 36 +/- 7 (+/- SEM) and 27 +/- 8 days in groups I and II, respectively. In contrast, groups III (n = 3) and IV (n = 5) had timely midcycle surges after the administration of dexamethasone or vehicle alone (4 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 2 days, respectively). The intermenstrual interval was lengthened by RU 486 administration in both group I and II animals (61 +/- 6 and 54 +/- 6 days) compared to controls (30 +/- 2; P less than 0.0001). In summary, RU 486 effectively blocked imminent midcycle gonadotropin surges, delayed subsequent folliculogenesis, and significantly extended the menstrual cycle length. If RU 486 acted as a pure P4 antagonist, then P4 is necessary for timely midcycle gonadotropin surges to occur. However, recent evidence showing agonistic properties of RU 486 (in the virtual absence of P4) at both endometrial and pituitary levels may favor a P4-like (agonistic) blockade of the estrogen-induced FSH/LH surges by RU 486.\r"

Four monkeys with spontaneous endometriosis were treated for 6 months with a continuous infusion of a GnRH agonist (25 micrograms/day). Five animals with surgically induced endometriosis were treated with the same agonist for 3 months. An additional group of five monkeys with surgically induced endometriosis was treated orally with levonorgestrel (1 mg/kg X day), while a final group of four monkeys served as untreated controls. During agonist treatment, the four monkeys with spontaneous endometriosis gained body weight and had a greater than 80% decline in cyst size (representing a decline in secretory activity). Monkeys with surgically induced endometriosis had almost total resolution of endometrial lesions during agonist treatment, which was maintained throughout a 4-month posttreatment period. After initial stimulation at the onset of the GnRH agonist infusion, serum LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone levels decreased to near the levels of detection, where they remained until treatment was terminated. In comparison, levonorgestrel reduced endometrial lesion size, but the monkeys did not resume normal cycles as early as those treated with the agonist. Levonorgestrel-treated monkeys had normal serum LH and FSH levels, but low serum estradiol and progesterone levels. The results of this study indicate that either continuous infusion of a GnRH agonist or administration of levonorgestrel is effective for treating endometriosis in monkeys. The hormonal data suggest that the GnRH agonist acts at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary, whereas levonorgestrel acts at the ovarian level.\r"

  ".W": "Follicular fluid estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione levels were compared in 2 groups of spontaneously ovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; which contains equal amounts of LH and FSH) or human urinary FSH (huFSH). The results were correlated with the ratios of embryo cleavage and pregnancy. Although significantly more FSH [1268 +/- 38 (+/- SEM) vs. 953 +/- 38 IU; P less than 0.05] was required for equivalent hyperstimulation in hMG compared to huFSH cycles, the number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized and the number of embryos transferred were similar for the 2 ovulation induction protocols. Forty-two follicles from 21 women stimulated with hMG and 38 follicles from 15 women stimulated with huFSH were examined and found to be representative of the total cohort of aspirated follicles. Follicular fluid estradiol and progesterone levels were similar, but hMG-stimulated follicles contained significantly more testosterone [7.83 +/- 0.52 (+/- SEM) vs. 6.30 +/- 0.42 ng/ml; P less than 0.03] and less androstenedione (24.4 +/- 3.6 vs. 37.8 +/- 5.0 ng/ml; P less than 0.03) than did huFSH-stimulated follicles. Embryonic cleavage rates were similar for all fertilized oocytes from both hMG- and huFSH-stimulated cycles, although pregnancy rates were significantly higher in huFSH cycles (40% vs. 9.5%; P less than 0.05). In addition, aromatase activity, progesterone production, and [125I]hCG-binding activity were compared in granulosa-luteal cells isolated from some of these women. Cells from 21 follicles from 9 women stimulated with hMG and 24 follicles from 9 women stimulated with huFSH were studied. There were no significant differences in aromatase activity, progesterone production, or [125I]hCG binding. Thus, the presence or absence of exogenous LH during ovulation induction with FSH has little direct effect on granulosaluteal cell function. However, the presence of LH during ovulation induction with FSH does appear to alter thecal androgen metabolism, resulting in higher testosterone and lower androstenedione levels in follicular fluid. Such a shift in androgen milieu may impair oocyte development and successful implantation.\r"

The basal plasma SmC levels of 66 patients were significantly correlated (P less than 0.01) with mean daily plasma GH levels, but not with the percent GH increase after GH-releasing hormone or TRH or the GH decrease after acute bromocriptine administration. Bromocriptine (7.5-15 mg/day) administration for 9.2 +/- 0.9 (+/- SD) months in 20 patients significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased GH levels. SmC decreased significantly [from 9.8 +/- 1.9 to 5.1 +/- 0.7 U/ml (mean +/- SE)] only in the 10 patients who had the more marked GH inhibition. The administration of a somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms twice daily), to 12 patients for 16 weeks significantly decreased plasma GH and SmC levels beginning on the second day of therapy; normal SmC levels were achieved in 5 of 12 patients. Pituitary adenomectomy resulted in normal GH and SmC levels in 10 of 12 and 8 of 12 patients, respectively. Our data indicate an overall dependency of plasma SmC levels on plasma GH levels in acromegaly, although similar GH levels may have differing somatomedin-stimulating activities. A derangement in the feedback mechanisms controlling GH secretion is indicated by the failure of elevated SmC levels to influence the GH responsiveness to releasing hormones. In evaluating pharmacological or surgical treatments of acromegaly, a single plasma SmC value can reliably replace several plasma GH determinations.\r"

The following individuals were studied: 13 normal subjects, 5 patients with low erythrocyte N-protein activity (PsHP type Ia), and 7 patients with normal erythrocyte N-protein activity (PsHP type Ib). Two additional patients with treated primary hypothyroidism who were relatives of a patient with PsHP type Ib were also studied. The patients with PsHP type Ia had blunted plasma cAMP responses to all glucagon doses. In contrast, the patients with PsHP type Ib had normal cAMP responses to glucagon infusion. However, the 2 relatives of the patient with PsHP type Ib had clearly decreased cAMP responses to glucagon infusion; both had normal renal responses to PTH and were clinically and biochemically euthyroid at the time of study. Glucose responses to glucagon were normal in both PsHP groups; the glucose response per unit cAMP response was slightly, but not significantly, enhanced in PsHP type Ia patients. Glucagon resistance appears to be a common finding in patients with PsHP type Ia, but not in those with PsHP type Ib. However, the observation of reduced glucagon responsivity in association with familial hypothyroidism in a kindred with PsHP type Ib suggests the possibility that this disorder may also cause disturbances in several hormone systems.\r"

The LHRH agonist buserelin (200 micrograms/12 h or 400 micrograms/24 h) was given intranasally for four consecutive cycles for 14 or 21 days in 26 normally cycling women. Five milligrams of medroxyprogesterone acetate were given orally twice daily from days 15-21. There was a 7-day pause between each medication cycle. Blood samples were drawn every other day for RIA of LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P). Serum FSH increased for only a few days at the beginning of each cycle, whereas sustained elevation of serum LH occurred during LHRH agonist administration. Serum E2 increased rapidly and remained elevated during the administration of buserelin. Serum P remained in the follicular phase range or increased briefly after the initiation of buserelin occasionally in the 14-day regimens. After discontinuation of buserelin, E2 fell rapidly, and uterine withdrawal bleeding occurred. During the pause, FSH increased progressively. The patterns of gonadotropin response to buserelin were similar in the four cycles. Based on measurement of the areas of the response curves, serum LH and E2 levels were higher during the administration of 200 micrograms/12 h compared to 400 micrograms/24 h buserelin. However, down-regulation of the pituitary-ovarian axis, as evaluated by the acute gonadotropin response to buserelin on day 14, was more pronounced with 200 micrograms/12 h than with 400 micrograms/24 h. Breakthrough bleeding occurred in the 14-day schedules, whereas withdrawal bleeding occurred during the pause in the 21-day schedules. The immediate cycles following buserelin administration were normal ovulatory cycles. Intermittent LHRH agonist administration for 21 days avoided constant down-regulation of the pituitary-ovarian axis and allowed regular uterine bleeding. Combined with an appropriate P complement, it could be a useful contraceptive approach.\r"

Although serum LH and FSH levels increased to similar peaks 3 h after commencing GnRH and nafarelin testing, they rose faster (P less than 0.01 at 1 h) and remained elevated longer (P less than 0.05 at 24 h) after nafarelin administration. At the third hour of testing with either agent, LH and FSH rose 8.8- and 3.4-fold, respectively (P less than 0.001 vs. baseline), whereas the rise in E2 was inconsistent and averaged only one third (P less than 0.02). However, plasma E2 increased later after nafarelin, but not after GnRH, rising from a baseline level of 30 +/- 6 (+/- SEM) to 115 +/- 13 pg/ml at 24 h (P less than 0.001). The least E2 response to nafarelin at this time was 150%. This rise is probably an underestimate of the maximum E2 rise, since a 6-fold response to nafarelin was found at 12 h in patients sampled then. Measurement of steroid intermediates from progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone to E2 indicated that the response to nafarelin was typical of normal ovarian follicular secretion. That is, plasma levels of the intermediates in E2 biosynthesis rose less than 2-fold, and only the elevations in androstenedione, from 58 +/- 10 to 78 +/- 16 ng/dl (P less than 0.05), and estrone, from 14 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 7 pg/ml (P less than 0.02), at 24 h were significant. The greater effectiveness of nafarelin than GnRH in stimulating E2 secretion appears to be related to the more prolonged gonadotropin response. The magnitude, consistency, specificity, and rapidity of the gonadotropin and E2 responses to nafarelin indicate that this is a promising agent for rapidly testing pituitary and ovarian function simultaneously.\r"

Plasma ANP levels were consistently higher in paired umbilical cord arterial than in cord venous samples. The mean umbilical cord arterial plasma ANP concentration [283 +/- 56 (+/- SEM) pg/ml] was significantly higher than that in cord venous plasma (165 +/- 27 pg/ml) or maternal peripheral venous plasma (155 +/- 25 pg/ml). Analyses by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed that the elution pattern of plasma ANP in cord arterial blood and that in maternal venous blood were nearly identical and that the retention time of the main ANP peak coincided with that of alpha-human ANP. These results suggest that alpha-human ANP is a circulating hormone in the human fetus.\r"

Serum GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) levels were elevated (2.34 ng/dl; normal, less than 0.02 ng/dl), suggesting that the acromegaly was caused by ectopic secretion of GHRH. Postmortem examination revealed that the right adrenal gland contained a pheochromocytoma in which GHRH was demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies. Gel permeation chromatography combined with the use of two GHRH antisera showed that GHRH-(1-44)-NH2 was a predominant form of the hormone. When the RNA from the tumor was extracted and analyzed by Northern gel blotting, two mRNA species were identified, with transcripts corresponding to 1600 and 780 base pairs. The pituitary gland was enlarged, but no distinct adenoma was found. Diffuse and nodular hyperplasia of somatotrophs in some areas resembling adenoma was identified on histological examination. These findings indicate that GH excess accompanied by somatotroph hyperplasia and acromegaly were secondary to a pheochromocytoma which secreted not only catecholamines but also GHRH.\r"

We studied 3 variants of the TBPA monomer recently identified in serum and amyloid fibrils of patients affected by familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). They represent single amino acid substitutions at positions 30 (type I), 60 (Appalachian), and 84 (type II). Tests of thyroid function and the apparent association constant (Ka) of T4 binding to TBPA were measured in whole serum from 14 carriers of FAP identified clinically, by amino acid sequence analysis, or by DNA restriction fragment analysis. Significant reduction of Ka was found in subjects with FAP types I and II, but not in subjects with the Appalachian type. Mean (+/- SD) values of 0.24 +/- 0.08 X 10(7) M-1 for type I and 0.26 +/- 0.10 X 10(7) M-1 for type II were significantly (P less than 0.0001) lower than those for normal relatives (1.39 +/- 0.30 X 10(7) M-1) or unrelated normal subjects (1.41 +/- 0.18 X 10(7) M-1). The mean Ka value for the five subjects with FAP of the Appalachian type was slightly but not significantly reduced (1.08 +/- 0.11 X 10(7) M-1). There was no overlap of individual Ka values of subjects with types I and II TBPA with those of subjects from all other groups. Abnormalities of thyroid function included slight but significant reductions of the mean total serum T4 concentration in the subjects with type II FAP and the mean serum total T3 concentration in those with type I FAP. Four subjects with FAP (two type II and two of the Appalachian type) had biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism. The three subjects with total serum T3 levels below the limit of normal had amyloid cardiomyopathy. These results indicate that TBPAs from subjects with FAP types I and II have relatively lower affinity for T4. Although none of the substituted amino acids in these variant TBPAs contribute directly to the surface of the putative T4-binding site, the side chains of amino acids 30 and 84, but not 60, interact with internal residues of the beta-structure which forms the presumed binding site, in agreement with our results of Ka measurements. The high incidence of hypothyroidism is due to the probably fortuitous occurrence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis as well as to partial destruction of the thyroid gland by amyloid deposits.\r"

ANP significantly inhibited basal and ACTH (3.4 X 10(-8) M)-stimulated cortisol and aldosterone secretion in both the adenomas and adjacent adrenocortical tissues from patients with Cushing's syndrome. ANP inhibited ACTH-stimulated, but not basal, secretion of cortisol and aldosterone in the adjacent tissues from patients with APA. In addition, ANP significantly inhibited both basal and ACTH-, angiotensin II (10(-6) M)-, and potassium chloride (10 mM)-stimulated secretion of aldosterone from the adenomas of patients with APA. ANP-induced changes in cortisol and aldosterone secretion were accompanied by a decrease in cAMP and an increase in cGMP secretion. These results suggest that ANP may be a possible regulator of cortisol as well as aldosterone secretion in humans, and these effects might be due to concomitant alteration in cyclic nucleotide metabolism.\r"

Serum testosterone (T) and LH levels, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemolytic complement (CH50) levels, and peripheral T lymphocyte subsets (OKT3+, OKT4+, and OKT8+) were measured before treatment, after 60 days of placebo treatment, and after 60 days of oral T undecanoate (TU) treatment. Before treatment and after placebo, with respect to normal men, the patients had lower serum T and higher LH levels, lower percentages and absolute values of OKT3+ (total T lymphocytes) and OKT8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes) cells, and, consequently, an increased OKT4/OKT8 ratio. Hemolytic complement (CH50) in serum was below normal in the two patients with SLE, while it was normal in the patients with SS. The ESR was above normal in all patients, and all had high titers of ANA and RF. After TU therapy, serum T levels increased and LH levels decreased, but not to normal. OKT3+ and OKT8+ cells and the OKT4/OKT8 ratio became normal, and RF and ANA titers decreased. The CH50 level did not change in the SS patients, while it increased to normal in the two patients with SLE. The ESR decreased in all patients during therapy. Furthermore, after TU therapy, both the SS and SLE patients had a clinical remission of their autoimmune disease. Our results indicate a therapeutic effect of T on autoimmune diseases in patients with hypogonadism and Klinefelter's syndrome.\r"

The mean basal plasma hANP level was 25 +/- 5 (+/- SEM) pg/ml in the young men and 120 +/- 22 pg/ml in the elderly men (P less than 0.01). The molecular size of plasma hANP in an aged man was similar to that of alpha hANP. The responses of plasma hANP and cGMP concentrations to an iv infusion of 500 ml 0.15 M NaCl also was compared. Mean plasma hANP concentrations increased significantly in both groups, and the response in the elderly men was exaggerated compared to that in the young men. However, the increases in plasma cGMP concentrations during NaCl loading were similar in both groups. We conclude that 1) the plasma hANP concentrations in healthy elderly men are higher than those in young men, and 2) the higher plasma hANP concentrations may be a compensatory response to reduced hANP activation of its receptors.\r"

The normal subjects had two peaks of plasma GHRH-LI after oral glucose administration. The initial peak GHRH-LI levels occurred 30-150 min after glucose ingestion and corresponded to an increase in blood glucose. The increment in plasma GHRH-LI levels 30 min after glucose ingestion [7.4 +/- 2.4 (+/- SEM) pg/ml] was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than that during a control study. Second peaks in plasma GHRH-LI occurred 3.5-6 h after glucose ingestion, and the mean increment 5 h after glucose ingestion was 9.4 +/- 2.4 pg/ml. This second rise of plasma GHRH-LI coincided with a significant increase in plasma GH after reactive hypoglycemia. This second GHRH-LI peak and the rise of plasma GH after hypoglycemia were absent in patients with IGHD, whereas the first peak of plasma GHRH-LI appeared shortly after glucose ingestion in these patients as well as in normal subjects. In addition, hypoglycemia produced by iv injection of regular insulin (0.1 U/kg) was not accompanied by increases in plasma GHRH-LI and GH levels in patients with IGHD, whereas insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in significant elevations of both plasma GHRH-LI and GH levels in normal subjects. These findings suggest that peripheral plasma GHRH-LI is derived from the hypothalamus as well as from an extrahypothalamic source(s); extrahypothalamic GHRH is released shortly after glucose ingestion; and secretion of GHRH from the hypothalamus is stimulated by hypoglycemia.\r"

Most of the cells taken from the malignant pleural effusion expressed T cell-associated antigens such as Leu-1 and OKT 8. To confirm these antigens as T-lineage lymphoma, we examined genomic DNA from malignant cells obtained from the pleural effusion. As was expected, T cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements were demonstrated. However, when the immunoglobulin gene organization was analyzed, we detected rearrangements in both the heavy- and kappa-chain genes. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which kappa-chain gene rearrangement was detected in apparent T-lineage cells. These findings provide important information relating to determination of the cellular lineage of lymphoid malignancy.\r"

Experiments were carried out in control conditions, during dietary potassium withdrawal, and after acute intravenous infusions of carbonic anhydrase. We observed highly significant net bicarbonate reabsorption in normal acid-base conditions as evidenced by the maintenance of significant bicarbonate concentration gradients in the presence of vigorous fluid absorption. Distal bicarbonate reabsorption persisted in hypokalemic alkalosis and even steeper transepithelial concentration gradients of bicarbonate were maintained. Enhancement of net bicarbonate reabsorption followed the acute intravenous administration of carbonic anhydrase but was limited to the nephron segments between the late proximal and early distal tubule. The latter observation is consistent with a disequilibrium pH along the proximal straight tubule (S3 segment), the thick ascending limb of Henle, and/or the early distal tubule.\r"

Thus, physiological levels of mineralocorticoids, but not glucocorticoids, control a fraction of sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle. ADX also inhibited potassium reabsorption in the loop of Henle. Both dexamethasone and aldosterone reversed the inhibition, although only aldosterone increased reabsorption to control levels. In the distal tubule, ADX reduced sodium reabsorption by 44%. Both aldosterone and dexamethasone stimulated reabsorption: however, only aldosterone increased transport to control. Potassium secretion by the distal tubule was also reduced 34% by ADX. Aldosterone, but not dexamethasone, stimulated secretion.

Even when perfusate tCO2 concentration closely matched plasma tCO2 concentration (30 mM tCO2), significant tCO2 entry again occurred at high flow. This was associated with a rise of the perfusate tCO2 concentration, which indicated net entry of tCO2 against a concentration gradient. In this \"symmetrical\" perfusion situation, acetazolamide blockade prevented tCO2 entry. Accordingly: distal tubule tCO2 entry is demonstrable in both alkalotic and normal rats at high flow rates; increasing perfusate tCO2 concentration can suppress tCO2 entry; and entry can occur in the absence of a gradient and this effect can be blocked by acetazolamide.\r"

The fusion proteins encoded by these three clones also react strongly with a monoclonal mouse anti-human fibrosarcoma PAI-1 antibody. By nucleotide sequence analysis, PAI-1 cDNA encodes a protein containing 402 amino acids with a predicted, nonglycosylated molecular mass of 45 kD. Identity of this material as authentic PAI-1 was confirmed by the presence of high level homology with the primary amino acid sequence of an internal peptide prepared from purified rat hepatoma PAI-1. The predicted amino acid sequence also reveals extensive homology with other members of the serine protease inhibitor gene family. Cultured HUVECs contain two PAI-1 mRNA species, both encoded by a single gene, differing by 1 kb in the 3' untranslated region. The PAI-1 gene is located on human chromosome 7.\r"

Excretion of DA, sodium, potassium, water, solute, and creatinine were measured in six normal men in 30-min intervals over 5 h after oral ingestion of protein and/or carbidopa, an inhibitor of DA formation from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Overall, protein increased urinary DA 50% (P = 0.031) while carbidopa reduced it 70% (P less than 0.0001), although suppression of DA excretion by carbidopa was not uniform over the 5 h of observation. Carbidopa doubled the level of DOPA in venous plasma and greatly magnified the DOPA response to protein. Inhibition of decarboxylase activity reduced excretion of sodium, potassium, solute and water after protein ingestion. These results indicate that extraneuronal DOPA decarboxylation in kidney contributes to acute protein-induced changes in renal function in man and suggest a general role for the decarboxylation of circulating DOPA in the expression of dopaminergic effects on the kidney in vivo.\r"

The complete gonococcal cryptic plasmid and HinfI derived digestion fragments subcloned into Escherichia coli were used to probe Southern blots of plasmid extracts. Homology was found to a plasmid of approximate molecular weight 4.5 kilobase pairs (Kb) but not to plasmids of less than 3.2 Kb or 6.5 Kb. Eleven of 16 strains of N meningitidis and two of six strains of N lactamica carried plasmids that showed strong hybridisation with the 4.2 Kb gonococcal plasmid. Hybridisation of plasmids from non-gonococcal species of neisseria with the gonococcal cryptic plasmid indicates that caution should be taken when using the cryptic plasmid as a diagnostic probe for gonorrhoea.\r"

The specificity of the test was confirmed by the absence of cross reacting antibodies to other Gram negative bacteria. The results showed differences in the titres of antibodies at different stages of P aeruginosa infection. Because of its reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity these preliminary results suggest that this test may be of value in monitoring the progress of P aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

Seventy-five sera had intercellular antibodies and 56 had basement membrane zone antibodies. The substrate influenced the results of 41% of assays for intercellular and 56% of those for basement membrane zone antibodies. Thirty-one percent of intercellular and 38% of basement membrane zone antibodies failed to react to one or more than one substrate, leading to false-negative reactions. In an additional 10% to 12% of sera, the titer of the reaction was influenced by the substrate. These results indicate that the substrate used has a major impact on the result of indirect immunofluorescence tests for antibodies to skin. The best overall single substrate was monkey esophagus, but optimal results were obtained when both monkey and guinea pig esophagus were used.\r"

Patency rate of the infarct-related coronary artery at the end of the rt-PA/placebo infusion and after 3 months of medical treatment (including oral anticoagulant agents) was 86 and 71%, respectively, in the rt-PA group, and 21 and 58%, respectively, in the placebo group. Regional wall motion of the infarct-related area was quantitated with digital subtraction angiography. Intrapatient comparisons revealed significant improvement in regional wall motion after 3 months in both the rt-PA and placebo groups. The improvement in the rt-PA group was not significantly greater than that in the placebo group. Thirteen patients (10 with rt-PA and 3 with placebo) with persistent patency (both early and late) of the infarct-related coronary artery showed a significant improvement of both global and regional left ventricular function, while 8 patients (2 with rt-PA and 6 with placebo) with persistent occlusion showed no changes. Antibodies against rt-PA were not detected in serum 2 weeks after the infusion, which is indicative of the lack of antigenicity of rt-PA and allows for its repeated administration.\r"

Mainly because of the risk and unpredictability of bleeding with this first generation of thrombolytic agents, thrombolysis has not been ingrained in medical practice. In the interim, more fibrin-specific thrombolytic agents have been developed such as acylated streptokinase-human plasminogen complex, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA or pro-urokinase). Only the latter two drugs do not induce major systemic fibrinogenolysis at thrombolytic effective doses. These two agents, obtained by recombinant techniques, as well as acylated streptokinase-plasminogen complex are available for clinical investigations. The first results of systemic administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activation (t-PA) in patients with acute myocardial infarction were published and are promising. Continued experimentation with t-PA and pro-urokinase in evolving myocardial infarction and other thrombotic disorders is essential to better delineate their therapeutic index.\r"

The skin test reactivity of mouse-pelt extract and mouse urine in two mouse-allergic subjects was significantly reduced after immunoabsorption with the gamma globulin fraction of this antiserum. The antigen defined by this antiserum was designated mouse allergen 1 (MA1). An immunoelectrophoretic procedure was set up to measure its concentration. MA1 had a molecular weight of approximately 19,000 on Sephadex gel filtration and 18,000 to 21,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing identified at least four bands with antigenic activity; the major band had an isoelectric point of 3.9. Significant antigenic and allergenic activity of MA1 was retained on reduction and digestion with papain and pepsin. Heating at 90 degrees C for periods up to 180 minutes resulted in a progressive loss, but not abolition, of activity. Serum and urine derived from male mice contained approximately fourfold more MA1 than samples derived from female mice. Urine contained at least 100-fold more MA1 than serum. Of the tissue extracts studied, liver extract had the highest amount of MA1. The immunochemical properties of MA1, its tissue distribution, and sex differences in its concentration provide strong evidence that MA1 is identical to the previously described mouse major urinary protein.\r"

Each patient was screened for possible food allergy by means of a questionnaire and by skin prick tests with the six food allergens most common in our area. Patients with either a suggestive history and/or a positive prick test and/or RAST underwent double-blind food challenge with lyophilized food in capsules or food mixed in a broth to disguise its taste. Pulmonary function tests and symptoms were followed for 8 hours after each challenge. Of the 300 patients screened, only 25 had either a history or skin prick tests or RAST responses suggestive of food allergy. Twenty patients had interpretable food challenges. In these 20 patients, food challenge caused asthma in six and caused other symptoms (atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms) in five. On rechallenge after pretreatment with disodium cromoglycate (300 mg 30 minutes before the food challenge), the asthmatic response was blocked in four of five subjects. The patients with asthma with food allergy were generally young, had a current or past history of atopic dermatitis, and high total serum IgE levels. Our findings confirm that food allergy can elicit asthma, but its incidence is low, even in the population attending a specialty clinic. Food elimination diets should not be prescribed for all patients reporting an adverse reaction to foods or having a positive skin prick test and/or RAST with food allergens. In patients with asthma caused by food allergy, disodium cromoglycate may be used to complement elimination diets.\r"

This double-blind study evaluated the safety and efficacy of astemizole in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (more than or equal to 3 months). Seventeen male and 34 female adult patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria entered the 2-month study. After a 48- to 72-hour washout, half the subjects were prerandomized to receive astemizole (10 mg), and the other half received placebo. Placebo-treated patients who were unable to complete the full 8 weeks because of uncontrolled chronic urticaria symptoms were entered into a 2-month open astemizole trial. Treatment with astemizole, as measured at the end point of each patient's treatment and compared to placebo, resulted in significant improvement of pruritus, erythema, number of wheals, frequency of urticarial attacks, and control of urticaria (p less than or equal to 0.03). The overall response to astemizole was significantly better than for placebo, according to both the investigator's and the patient's global evaluations (p less than 0.01) and as indicated by dropouts caused by treatment failure with placebo (p = 0.005). Six of 26 (24%) of the placebo-treated patients in the double-blind study had good to excellent results on the basis of global assessments. Thirteen of 16 patients with placebo-treatment failures who received astemizole in the open trial improved significantly from baseline symptoms of pruritus, erythema, and number of wheals (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant side effects were reported except mild sedation in three astemizole-treated subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 20 different preparations were studied for protein and carbohydrate content, presence of endotoxins, mycotoxins, and hemolytic toxins. These extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis for protein components. The immunogenicity of the preparations was determined by rocket electrophoresis with rabbit anti-A. fumigatus sera and by agar gel diffusion with sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, and normal control subjects. In order to have dependable immunologic results, the Ags must be sufficiently pure and reproducible. Until such time as pure and standardized Ags are available, the crude Ags used should be characterized to the extent that adequate reproducibility between preparations can be ascertained. The enzyme profile of the Ag preparations provides a fair indication of the quality of antigenic components, and together with other immunochemical parameters, it will be of use in determining the suitability of the extracts in immunodiagnosis. Immunochemical results demonstrate that commercial Ags contain less proteins and carbohydrates and fewer enzymes than the homemade antigens. In addition, fewer patients demonstrated specific precipitins against commercial Ags than with homemade Ags. This study once again confirms the need for pure standardized Ags for studying the immunologic response in patients with Aspergillus-induced diseases. Until such preparations are readily available, partially purified or crude Ags with known immunochemical properties and enzyme profile may be the choice for immunodiagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Within the last decade, significant advances have been made both in treating children with cancer and in providing proper nutrition support. Oncologic treatment and nutrition research and their application to the nutrition care of children with cancer are reviewed. Quality nutrition care is now possible because of an improved understanding of (a) the prevalence and significance of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in high-risk groups, (b) the staging and assessment of nutritional status, and (c) the efficacy and limitations of nutrition support options. Nutrition staging, assessment, and support should be integrated into treatment protocols for children with neoplastic diseases. Common risk factors for the development of PEM have been identified from serial monitoring of newly diagnosed children with a variety of tumors. Certain tumor types and their treatment can be classified within either low or high nutritional risk groups. A comprehensive nutrition program (intense nutrition counseling, favorite nutritious foods) is preferred for low nutritional risk groups but is ineffective in preventing or reversing PEM in high-risk groups. For high-risk patients, central parenteral nutrition (CPN) is the method of choice as a relatively short-term but important support measure that allows children to withstand long intervals of intense treatment during periods of growth and development. Current data suggest that bone marrow suppression may be attenuated and treatment tolerance improved with the use of CPN in selected children with advanced cancer (e.g., acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or advanced neuroblastoma).\r"

This antibody did not inhibit the binding of human IgG1 to monocytes or to the U937 cell line, nor did it block or stimulate their killing of IgG-coated chicken erythrocytes (CE). Whole 32.2 or its Fab fragments were cross-linked to Fab fragments of rabbit anti-CE by using the agent SPDP. The resulting heteroantibodies (32.2 X Fab anti-CE) mediated monocyte and U937 cytotoxicity against CE, whereas an anti-HLA X anti-CE reagent did not. Both FcR expression and heteroantibody-mediated cytotoxicity were increased by culturing monocytes or U937 with IFN-gamma. Although IgG-mediated ADCC was significantly inhibited by 40 micrograms/ml human IgG1, cytotoxicity mediated by 32.2 X Fab anti-CE was not blocked by 2 mg/ml human IgG1, suggesting that such cytotoxicity might not be blocked by IgG in vivo. These data indicate the potential of 32.2 heteroantibodies in analysis of FcR function and in therapy.\r"

The fine specificity of T cell recognition of this peptide was determined by using several hFPB homologs and analogs, which indicated that the intact 14-amino acid peptide must remain intact to preserve the antigenic determinant, and that the carboxyl terminal Arg14 was important for T cell responses. Of particular interest was the finding that APC-associated hFPB failed to stimulate the T cells, and that activation was only observed with soluble peptide or by brief hFPB treatment of the T cells and APC mixed together. In addition, hFPB covalently bound to agarose beads was able to cause T cell activation, provided that I-Ak+ APC were also present in the culture. A number of control experiments were performed that showed that hFPB was not released from the bead and that the antigenic peptide involved in T cell responses remained bound to the beads. These results indicate that the form of the hFPB peptide antigen recognized by this T cell can be provided separately from APC.\r"

This lymphoid population, called BH, is present in the spleens of normal and athymic mice and preferentially helps the expression of plaque-forming B cells that carry NPb idiotypic determinants. To define the mechanism by which this cell population functions, the roles of T and B lymphocyte function associated antigens were studied. The data indicate that BH cells express immunoglobulin receptor components, i.e., IgM, IgD heavy chain, and lambda light chain immunoglobulin markers as well as the J11d marker associated with immature B cells. BH cells may also express determinants identical to or cross-reactive with the T cell-associated antigens L3T4a, L3T4b, and LFA-1 as defined by treatment with monoclonal antibodies specific for these antigens. In addition, L3T4a- and LFA-1- but not Lyt-1-like antigens appear to be functionally involved in BH-dependent helper activity, since augmentation of NPb idiotypic PFC responses was blocked with anti-L3T4a or anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies. Further analysis of BH-containing populations indicates that T cells are probably not involved in BH cell function and therefore are not responsible for the presence of Lyt-1, L3T4a, or L3T4b determinants in this T-independent system. The relationship of this helper cell subset to conventional T and B cell populations is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of mice with monoclonal antibody (MAb) to L3T4 blocks the humoral immune response to antigens administered when L3T4+ cells are depleted. To determine whether depletion of target cells is required to suppress immunity, we examined the effect of treatment with F(ab')2 fragments of anti-L3T4 on the response of BALB/c mice to immunization with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in complete Freund's adjuvant. Treatment with F(ab')2 fragments of anti-L3T4 every 2 days (1 mg i.p.) beginning at the time of immunization significantly inhibited production of anti-BSA antibodies without depleting target cells. A single injection of anti-L3T4 fragments at the time of immunization also significantly inhibited production of anti-BSA antibodies, but was not as effective as repeated administration of the MAb fragments (75% inhibition compared with 98% inhibition; p less than 0.05). Moreover, one injection of anti-L3T4 fragments stimulated a host immune response to the rat MAb, whereas sustained therapy with the anti-L3T4 fragments blocked this response. Surprisingly, low doses (less than or equal to 10 micrograms/mouse) of intact rat MAb to L3T4 also stimulated a host immune response to the MAb but, as previously reported, higher doses of intact MAb to L3T4 did not. These findings establish that depletion of L3T4+ cells is not required to suppress immunity with MAb to L3T4. They also indicate that the ability of rat MAb to L3T4 to block the immune response to itself is dose dependent. Because the L3T4 antigen in mice is homologous to the CD4 antigen in humans, our findings have implications regarding the potential use of MAb to CD4 in humans.\r"

In this study, we generated T8+ cell lines from the peripheral blood of these same patients and controls. Suppressor activity, mediated by T8+ cells exposed to OKT3 on days 1, 7, and 14 of culture and then treated with mitomycin C on day 16, was significantly reduced in the MS group (mean percent suppression 13% +/- 5) as compared with the control group (68% +/- 6, n = 8, p less than 0.001). No differences were noted in [3H]thymidine uptake by the OKT3-stimulated T8+ cell lines of MS and control groups. Mean percent suppression mediated by T4+ cell lines did not differ between MS and control groups (15% +/- 4, n = 3, vs 22% +/- 2, n = 4). These current data suggest that the previously observed defect in T8+ cell-mediated activated suppressor cell function in MS is a persistent one, favoring the postulate that the defect reflects intrinsic alterations in this cell population rather than a transient effect of serum factors on T8+ cell function.\r"

To assess their differentiative potential and determine their capacity to function as immune effectors, cells from the cultures were transplanted into mice with severe combined immune deficiency disease (SCID). SCID mice are deficient in T and B lymphocytes and are serum immunoglobulin (Ig) negative, but grafts of normal lymphoid precursors can expand and differentiate in them, thereby restoring immunocompetence. The results of these studies indicate that cells from LBMC are able to reconstitute splenic B lymphocytes in the SCID mice. Upon in vivo transfer, LBMC cells secreted Ig that displayed isotype distribution and a pattern of heterogeneity comparable with normal BALB/c mice, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The transplanted LBMC cells were functional, because reconstituted mice could respond to immunization with the T-independent antigen TNP-Ficoll. The results also indicate that cultured cells could reconstitute T cell activity in SCID mice. Splenocytes from approximately one-third of the recipients could generate a cytotoxic response to alloantigens after 5 days of sensitization in a mixed lymphocyte culture, and all reconstituted SCID mice could respond to immunization with the T cell-dependent antigen TNP-BSA. These results demonstrate that B cells, as well as T cell activity, are present in LBMC-reconstituted SCID mice, and show that LBMC cells have the capacity to mediate an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from CTL precursors requires a combination of antigen and lymphokine signals. To investigate lymphokine requirements for CTL generation, we used an assay in which helper T cell and accessory cell-depleted spleen cells or whole thymocytes were cultured with lectin (Con A) and lymphokines. This culture was followed by assessment of lectin-dependent cytolysis. High concentrations of recombinant interleukin 2 (R-IL 2) (100 U/ml) alone were not sufficient for lectin-mediated CTL induction from thymocytes, whereas 20 to 100 U/ml of R-IL 2 alone could induce a significant lectin-mediated CTL response from accessory cell-depleted spleen cells. Using thymocytes as responders, we found purified or recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not cause cytolytic activity either in the absence of or in the presence of R-IL 2. However, supernatant from Con A-stimulated rat spleen cells (rat Con A SN) in combination with R-IL 2 could induce cytolytic activity, suggesting that several factors are required for CTL induction. Con A SN was fractionated by gel filtration and the fractions were tested for ability to induce CTL. In the presence of a low level of R-IL 2 (5 U/ml), fractions with a Mr of approximately 31,000 could induce CTL, and this activity was referred to as CTL differentiation factor (CDF). The peak fractions containing CDF activity did not have detectable IL 1, IL 2, IFN-gamma, or CSF activity. However, by add-back experiments and the use of blocking antibodies, a monoclonal antibody against the IL 2 receptor or antibodies against murine IFN-gamma, we demonstrated that CTL induction from mature thymocytes (L3T4-, Lyt-2+) requires CDF activity in addition to IL 2 and IFN-gamma.\r"

Thymocyte subpopulations were selected by the indirect \"panning\" technique, and their purity was checked by cytofluorometry. Microcultures were set up with an optimal concentration of PMA, EL4 supernatant, or pure IL 2 obtained by recombinant DNA technology (r-IL 2) in the presence or in the absence of accessory splenic adherent cells (SAC). Under these conditions, only the Lyt-2+ CRT proliferated, and this response was IL 2-dose-dependent and was increased by accessory cells. When the calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the cultures, the proliferation of L3T4+ CRT was greatly increased. These results were confirmed by cultures at limiting dilution of positively selected Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ subpopulations of CRT at optimal concentrations of PMA, r-IL 2, A23187, and accessory cells. These results are consistent with the idea that two signals are necessary to activate L3T4+ CRT, whereas only IL 2 is necessary for PMA-induced proliferation of Lyt-2+ CRT. Finally, unlike the case of lectin-induced proliferation of Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ CRT, the presence of accessory cells or cell-cell contact is important for optimal response to PMA + IL 2.\r"

  ".U": "87058935\r", 
  ".W": "The tumor co-promotor TPA is believed to enhance a wide variety of cellular processes by interacting with protein kinase C. Interleukin (IL 1) is a family of highly active molecules which augments the host response to infection. We have explored the interactions of these activators of cell function on the modulation of selected eosinophil functions. The effects of purified monocyte-derived IL 1 on the eosinophil functions of oxidative metabolism (as measured by superoxide anion production) and degranulation (as measured by release of the granular enzymes arylsulfatase and beta-glucuronidase) have been examined. Superoxide anion production by eosinophils stimulated with standard doses of the stimulant phorbol myristic acetate (TPA) (1 microgram/ml) was augmented approximately 20% by preincubation with IL 1. However, IL 1 alone had no effect on superoxide anion production. At suboptimal doses of TPA, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide anion production in the presence of IL 1. Calcium ionophore (2 X 10(-7) M) markedly enhanced superoxide anion production elicited by 0.1 ng/ml of TPA, but had only modest effects in the absence of TPA. When IL 1 was added to eosinophils stimulated by TPA in the presence of calcium ionophore, there was a dose-dependent increase in superoxide anion production. In contrast to other cell types, degranulation as measured by the release of arylsulfatase and beta-glucuronidase was not elicited by the addition of TPA (1 microgram/ml). Although calcium ionophore (2 X 10(-6) M) caused enzyme release (24.2% release of beta-glucuronidase, 29.4% release of arylsulfatase), this release was inhibited by the addition of TPA. The addition of IL 1 alone caused an approximate twofold increase in enzyme release, but pretreatment with IL 1 (1 U) reduced ionophore-mediated degranulation (p less than or equal to 0.05). Studies employing purified monocyte IL 1 were confirmed by recombinant IL 1-beta. These studies demonstrate for the first time that eosinophil function is modulated by IL 1. IL 1 may also modify the response of eosinophils to other stimuli such as ionophore and TPA. Because TPA is known to act by direct binding to protein kinase C, these studies also demonstrate that, in eosinophils, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters may augment one cellular function (oxidative metabolism) while inhibiting another cellular function (degranulation). Similarly, phorbol esters may act synergistically with calcium ionophore in regulation of one function (oxidative metabolism) and act antagonistically with another function (degranulation). The concept that IL 1 uniformly enhances cell function may need to be re-evaluated.\r"

It is still not clear how this abnormality relates to the B cell hyperactivity in the disease. Some investigators proposed that an intrinsic T helper cell defect could lead to suppressor cell dysfunction and autoimmunity. Others have found that in fact increased suppressor cell activity can cause IL 2 hyposecretion. In the present study we report that the IL 2 secretion in response to PHA plus PMA by T cells from patients with SLE, which initially was decreased by a factor of 10 as compared with the IL 2 secretion in blood donor T cells, was restored when the T cells were rested for 2 to 3 days in culture before stimulation. IL 2 hyposecretion in SLE T cells and the kinetics of normalization in culture were not changed by the addition of normal adherent cells during the stimulation with PHA/PMA, occurred in the absence of significant cell death or proliferation or change of the T4:T8 cell ratio during the resting culture, were not due to a maturation of immature T6-positive cells (less than 1.5% T6 cells in SLE T cells), and also occurred in T8-depleted T4 cells alone. Furthermore, a normalization of IL 2 secretion took place in the presence of either SLE serum or normal serum, and the addition of fresh autologous T cells to 3-day-cultured SLE T cells did not cause suppression of IL 2 secretion. These data show that some rapidly reversible defect occurs in circulating T helper cells in SLE. That this could reflect an exhaustion of T helper cells that have been activated in vivo is discussed.\r"

This suppression is most effective when relatively low concentrations of BSF-1 are employed, but is still very substantial even when optimal concentrations of BSF-1 were used. This suppression is also observed when size-separated small B cells which are devoid of detectable macrophages or NK cells are cultured with BSF-1 and reIFN-gamma, thus suggesting that IFN-gamma-mediated inhibition is a consequence of a direct effect on the B cells. Incubation of B cells with reIFN-gamma for 24 hr before their culture with BSF-1 did not prevent BSF-1-stimulated increases in sIa. This finding supports the contention that the effect of IFN-gamma is not mediated via the stimulation of \"suppressor\" influences in these cell cultures. The inhibition of B cell activation by IFN-gamma occurs within the first 3 hr after the onset of culture, as demonstrated by the inability of antibody to IFN-gamma to totally reverse the IFN-gamma-mediated suppressive effects on B cell proliferation if it is added later than 3 hr after the onset of culture. These results suggest a role for IFN-gamma in down-regulating the ability of B cells to function as antigen-presenting cells in non-cognate T cell-dependent responses.\r"

Both IL 2 and IFN-gamma were found to enhance NS activity, with IFN-gamma being the most active molecule. To generalize these findings, normal adult bone marrow (BM), a second environment where NS activity has been reported, was examined. Normal adult BM cells nonspecifically suppressed both B and T cell mitogen responses. BM suppression could also be enhanced by the addition of CAS to the cultures. Removal of plastic-adherent cells, Thy-1.2-positive cells, or B cells did not significantly diminish suppression or remove the ability to enhance suppression with CAS. When isolated on discontinuous Percoll gradients, BM suppressor cells banded in the less dense fractions, and the suppression in these bands was also enhanced by lymphokines. The suppressive activity of these cells was greatly enhanced by the addition of CAS, IFN-gamma, or IL 2. However, IFN-gamma appears to be a more potent enhancing molecule, being active at levels between 1 and 10 U/ml.\r"

We have used a long-term human marrow culture system that forms multinucleated cells (MNC) with osteoclast characteristics to test the effect of recombinant human IFN-gamma on MNC formation. The addition of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1,25D3) at 10(-8) M to these cultures significantly increased both MNC formation and the number of nuclei per MNC. IFN-gamma at 100 U/ml strongly inhibited both of these effects of 1,25D3 in this system. IFN-gamma significantly inhibited MNC formation at very low concentrations (4 U/ml), with 10 U/ml inhibiting 1,25D3-stimulated MNC formation by 50%. In contrast, 100 U/ml of IFN-gamma were required to inhibit the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, the probable progenitor for MNC, by 50%. Treatment of cultures with IFN-gamma for only the first or last week of culture significantly inhibited MNC formation stimulated by 1,25D3. Autoradiographic studies with [3H]thymidine showed that IFN-gamma did not inhibit proliferation of precursors for MNC. Additionally, IFN-gamma inhibited MNC formation stimulated by parathyroid hormone or interleukin 1. These results suggest that IFN-gamma inhibits MNC formation, and that IFN-gamma inhibits bone resorption in part by inhibiting osteoclast formation.\r"

The A29 cell line is thought to represent the hybrid analog of the Ts2 suppressor cell population in the cascade regulating the immune response to the P815 tumor in DBA/2 mice. The putative TsF2 molecule is reactive with the monoclonal antibody B16G, shown previously by us to bind a public specificity of T suppressor factors (TsF). A29 TsF also exhibits specific binding to a TsF1 secreted by another T cell hybridoma, A10, which shows specificity for antigen from the P815 tumor (this has been described previously). A29 itself does not exhibit binding to P815 antigens. Affinity-purified material from A29 appears to share characteristics with A10 molecules in that the predominant material has an apparent m.w. of 70,000. Studies with calcium flux of A29 cells showed that they respond significantly and specifically on exposure to A10 TsF stimulus. We showed further that affinity-purified A29 TsF molecules can specifically suppress the in vitro generation of syngeneic CTL to the P815 tumor, and that panning of DBA/2 splenocytes over A29-TsF-coated plates renders cell populations capable of generating a higher in vitro CTL response to P815 than appropriately treated controls.\r"

A significant intrapair correlation coefficient of the maximal percent of anti-IgE-induced histamine release was found in the MZ, whereas no significant correlation was found in the DZ. The mean intrapair variance of anti-IgE-induced histamine release in MZ (VMZ) and in DZ (VDZ) gave an F value equal to 3.84 (p less than 0.01) and a heritability (H) index of 0.74. Similar findings were obtained with respect to the sensitivity to a standard concentration (10(-1) micrograms/ml) of anti-IgE. No correlation between serum IgE level and anti-IgE-induced histamine release was found in either MZ or DZ. A significant intrapair correlation coefficient of f-met peptide-induced histamine release was found in both the MZ and the DZ. The difference between MZ and DZ was not significant. The VMZ and the VDZ of the f-met peptide-induced histamine release gave an F value of 1.52 (NS) and an H value of 0.34. The intrapair correlation coefficient of A23187-induced release was significant in MZ and not significant in DZ. The mean intrapair variance of A23187-induced histamine release gave an F value of 2.33 (NS) and an H index of 0.57. Similar findings were obtained by using suboptimal (3 X 10(-1) micrograms/ml) concentrations of A23187. There was no correlation between the sensitivity of basophils to release in response to anti-IgE and their response to f-met peptide or A23187, in either the MZ or the DZ.

This technique facilitates the determination of epitopes on the schistosomula in addition to those detected by surface labeling and immunoprecipitation. By using this technique, it has been demonstrated that there is a much greater binding to the parasite surface of antibodies from chronically infected mice (CMS) than of antibodies from mice infected with highly irradiated cercariae (VMS), and CMS recognizes epitopes that VMS does not. Treatment of the surface of the schistosomula with trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and sodium metaperiodate has suggested that the discrepancy of the binding between the two sera is due to the recognition of a large number of additional epitopes by CMS, which are carbohydrate in nature. Some of the carbohydrate epitopes are expressed on the previously described surface glycoprotein antigens of Mr 200,000, 38,000, and 17,000.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant rabbit fibroma virus (MV) is an oncogenic immunosuppressive leporipoxvirus. We studied the effects of MV infection and MV-associated tumor-induced suppressor factor (TISF) on the production of and responsiveness to interleukins 1 and 2. Adherent cells from MV tumor-bearing rabbits elaborate adequate amounts of IL 1 in response to E. coli endotoxin. Neither live virus nor TISF alters the production or the responsiveness to IL 1. However, when we examined spleen cells from rabbits 7 days after MV inoculation, we noted that their ability to produce and respond to IL 2 is deficient. Despite their relatively poor capacity to produce IL 2, these spleen cells express receptor for IL 2 in normal amounts, as measured by the monoclonal antibody 7D4. TISF derived from T lymphocytes from MV tumor-bearing rabbits is by itself capable of inhibiting partially normal secretion of IL 2 and also the response of the cloned murine T cell line HT-2 to added IL 2. Full expression of the immunosuppressive capacity of spleen cells from MV tumor-bearing rabbits requires cell-cell contact, however, and cannot be replaced by either live virus or spleen cell supernatants. Such spleen cells inhibit normal mitogen responsiveness, a defect not remedied by adding exogenous IL 2. Immunologic dysfunction induced by MV infection is transient, and by 11 days after virus inoculation, actively mediated recovery from immunosuppression is observed. We found that spleen cells from rabbits studied 11 days postinoculation secreted IL 2 normally. Thus, immunologic dysfunction secondary to infection with malignant rabbit fibroma virus reflects deficiencies in both elaboration of and response to IL 2, and return of immune function later in the course of the infection is associated with return of the ability of lymphocytes to secrete IL 2.\r"

Stimulation of T cell clones with recombinant IL 2 resulted in proliferation and sustained expression of the c-myc cellular proto-oncogene, but did not induce the expression of mRNA for the lymphokines IFN-gamma and IL 2. In contrast, stimulation of cloned T cells with lectin alone induced significant IFN-gamma and IL 2 mRNA expression, up-regulation of the number of cell surface IL 2 receptors, and transient c-myc expression. Ionomycin alone was not a sufficient signal for lymphokine mRNA induction. The phorbol ester PMA alone induced neither proliferation nor lymphokine gene expression but potentiated lectin and ionomycin-mediated signals. We also performed experiments to examine whether the T cell response to extracellular stimuli was a function of the activation state of the cell. Reexposure of 48-hr antigen-activated cloned cells to identical stimuli revealed several differences. Low but significant levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were now also reinduced in activated clones cells in response to IL 2 or PMA alone. Activated cells were refractory to reinduction of IL 2 mRNA by any stimulus, which may reflect a physiologic mechanism to limit clonal expansion after antigenic stimulation. This could be partially reversed by restimulation with lectin in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting a role for a labile protein repressor in the down-regulation of IL 2 mRNA expression. PMA alone induced an IL 2-independent proliferative response. We demonstrate that distinct signals are required for lymphokine gene expression vs cellular proliferation in cloned T lymphocyte populations, and that the capacity of extracellular stimuli to reinduce expression of lymphokine genes or to mediate cell proliferation is altered by prior activation.\r"

  ".U": "87058963\r", 
  ".W": "The studies reported here describe the feasibility of using single cell techniques with nonadherent target cells for the formation of T helper lymphocyte-target cell conjugates in an Ia recognition system. We have taken advantage of four tumor-specific T cell hybridomas lines, two of which respond only to IA-bearing RCS tumor cells of SJL/J (H-2s) origin, and the other two that respond to both RCS and IA- or IE-bearing allogeneic cells of H-2k,d haplotypes. The conjugate frequency between the T cell hybridomas and target cells was scored microscopically and was facilitated by labeling the lymphocyte with fluorescein. The frequency of conjugate formation ranged from 20 to 40% above background. Conjugate formation was antigen specific and correlated well with the hybridoma specificity determined by IL 2 responses after antigenic stimulation. The cross-reactive hybridomas formed conjugates with RCS and LPS blasts derived from CBA or DBA/2 origin, but not with cells of syngeneic or other allogeneic strains. Conjugate formation with RCS was inhibited greater than 50% with mAb directed against IAs determinants on the RCS tumor cells, and conjugate formation with allogeneic cells was blocked only with mAb directed to either IA/IEk or IA/IEd specificities directed against the alpha or beta polypeptide chain. Blocking of conjugate formation was also achieved by various mAb directed against surface membrane molecules associated with the T cell hybridomas. LFA-1 mAb inhibited significantly the formation of conjugates. However, L3T4 mAb blocked only partially the conjugates. Other antibodies directed against Lyt-1 or Thy-1.2 antigens were without blocking effect. The poor blocking observed with L3T4 mAb did not correlate with the almost complete blocking observed in the IL 2 response by the same hybridomas. These studies of the syngeneic anti-RCS tumor response directed against IA-bearing RCS showed that the conjugate assay permits mapping of tumor-associated Ia epitopes. In addition, the results of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of conjugate formation in determining the antigenic specificity of the T helper system. This assay system can be used to establish the minimal frequency of antigen-reactive cells and can divide the T helper response into multiple steps (i.e., recognition/binding, activation, proliferation, and lymphokine release) and determine the surface membrane molecules involved in recognition.\r"

The 78,000 dalton early antigen (Ea) 1 is present at low levels on resting lymphocytes, and its expression is enhanced twofold to threefold within 3 hr of stimulation. Ea2, a nondisulfide-bonded 86,000 and 73,000 dalton heterodimer, is first detectable 3 hr after activation and peaks by 9 hr. Its presence on all but a few cell lines, plus the variable association with a lower m.w. (28,000) structure, suggest that it may serve as a receptor for a growth factor. Neither Ea1 nor Ea2 are restricted to lymphocytes. The 31,000 dalton Ea3 antigen is induced only by PHA but not by other means of activation, and may pre-exist within the cell. The Ea3 antibody blocks PHA-induced but not OKT3-induced mitogenesis, suggesting differences in the pathways of activation by these two stimuli. These reagents, and OKT3, were used to define the cyclosporine A (CSA)-sensitive stage of lymphocyte activation. CSA blocks at a point before the biosynthesis of Ea1 and after that of T3/T cell receptor loss from the cell surface, at a point close to Ea2 biosynthesis.\r"

Resting T cells required the presence of accessory cells (AC) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to be stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 (OKT3 and 64.1). Anti-CD3 was unable to induce activation of AC-depleted T cells as determined by IL 2 receptor expression, IL 2 production, cell cycle analysis, or detectable DNA synthesis. Although T cell responses to PHA also required AC, far fewer were necessary to generate responses. Anti-CD3 inhibited PHA-stimulated T cell IL 2 production, IL 2 receptor expression and proliferation in partially AC-depleted cultures. Moreover, anti-CD3 was able to inhibit PHA responses when added to culture as late as 24 to 42 hr after the initiation of a 96-hr incubation. Increasing concentrations of PHA reduced the inhibitory effect of anti-CD3 on PHA-stimulated T cell proliferation, whereas IL 2 production remained suppressed. Anti-CD3 linked to Sepharose beads effectively inhibited PHA-stimulated T cell DNA synthesis, indicating that internalization of the CD3 molecule was not required for inhibition of PHA responses. Although inhibition of IL 2 production was a major effect of anti-CD3 in PHA-stimulated cultures, it was not the only apparent inhibitory effect because the addition of exogenous IL 2 could not prevent inhibition completely. Intact AC but not IL 1 also reduced anti-CD3-mediated inhibition of PHA responsiveness, whereas the addition of both IL 2 and AC largely prevented inhibition. Thus, anti-CD3 in the absence of adequate AC signals exerted a number of distinct inhibitory effects on mitogen-induced T cell activation. These results suggest that the CD3 molecular complex may play a role in regulating T cell responsiveness after engagement of the T cell receptor by a number of mechanisms, some of which involve inhibition of IL 2 production.\r"

  ".W": "Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy [GSE]) is a disorder characterized by small intestinal mucosal injury caused by dietary exposure to wheat gluten and similar proteins. There is evidence that the mucosal injury is immunologically mediated and there is an inflammatory infiltrate present in the mucosa. It is postulated that release of lipid-derived inflammatory mediators may be involved in the pathogenesis of the mucosal injury. Jejunal mucosal biopsy samples from patients with GSE and from a group of patients who were subsequently shown to have normal jejunal mucosa were incubated with tritiated arachidonate and a peptic/tryptic digest of either gluten or casein. Generation of lipid-derived inflammatory mediators was measured by beta-scintillation counting after separation of metabolites by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with two different buffer systems. The predominant arachidonic acid metabolite generated was 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Mucosa from newly diagnosed GSE patients on a normal diet generated more 15-HETE than either control patients or GSE patients maintained on a gluten-free diet. In addition, gluten acted as a specific stimulus to 15-HETE production by mucosa from the GSE patients on a normal diet. 15-HETE has a number of biologic effects that could contribute to the mucosal changes seen in GSE, and the specific release of 15-HETE by gluten suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of the disorder.\r"

An IgM monoclonal antibody from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and neuropathy bound to denatured DNA and immunostained myelin in peripheral nerve and spinal cord. The monoclonal IgM bound to ELISA microwells coated with a mixture of phosphatidic acid and gangliosides at serum dilutions of up to 1/100,000, but binding to phosphatidic acid alone was observed at dilutions of less than 1/100 only, and there was no binding to gangliosides alone. Incubation with micelles containing phosphatidic acid and gangliosides selectively absorbed the monoclonal IgM and inhibited its binding to denatured DNA and to myelin. These observations suggest that autoantibodies may bind to conformational epitopes formed by two separate molecules, and that autoantibodies that cross-react with phosphorylated epitopes in DNA and neural tissue could be involved in autoimmune neurologic diseases.\r"

We have observed that treatment of an IL 2 independent murine T cell line, BUD-27, with IL 2, calcium ionophore A23187, or agents that activate phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C results in increased IFN-gamma mRNA transcription and release of anti-viral activity. These same agents each induced the subcellular redistribution of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membrane in both the BUD-27 cell line and its IL 2-dependent parent, CT6. Ionophore concentrations greater than 1 micron exhibited the most significant induction of IFN-gamma mRNA, which also correlated with the dose of ionophore, inducing translocation of protein kinase C. This correlation between increased mRNA levels and protein kinase C translocation suggests that a calcium-dependent event is involved in induction of IFN-gamma mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the magnitude of the translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membrane corresponded to the physiologic IL 2 dose-response for IFN-gamma secretion. The data suggest that the activation of protein kinase C and/or coordinate elevation of intracellular calcium may provide at least one mechanism of signal transduction for the regulation of IFN-gamma gene transcription.\r"

It has a peptide backbone that is approximately 10 Kd smaller than that of its membrane-associated counterpart. Affinity chromatography demonstrated that released IL 2R from either an HTLV-I-positive T cell line (HUT-102) or PHA-activated normal peripheral lymphocytes binds efficiently to purified recombinant IL 2. Furthermore, the interaction between the growth factor and the released receptor does not appear to require any accessory molecules. These observations suggest a potentially significant role for the released IL 2R in the regulation of IL 2-dependent lymphocyte functions.\r"

A monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits the biological activities of IFN-gamma blocks its BCGF activity supporting the specificity of the IFN-gamma effect. Various IFN-gamma obtained from different sources displayed the same BCGF activity. Nonactivated B lymphocytes do not proliferate in response to IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma acts directly on B cells because highly purified B cells obtained after standard purification procedures coupled to cell sorting could still proliferate in response to IFN-gamma. Blood B lymphocytes were found to be more sensitive to the BCGF activity of IFN-gamma than B cells obtained from spleens or tonsils. The IFN-gamma-induced proliferation of B cells was short lasting when compared with that of recombinant IL 2 or BCGF containing T cell clone supernatants. B cells preactivated with either Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) or optimal concentrations of anti-IgM antibodies coupled to beads did not proliferate in response to IFN-gamma, whereas they proliferated in response to IL 2 or T cell clone supernatants. IFN-gamma did not stimulate nor inhibit the proliferative response of human B lymphocytes stimulated with optimal concentrations of anti-IgM antibodies or SAC. Additionally none of the different IFN-gamma tested had B cell differentiation factor activity in the standard SAC assay. These results indicate that IFN-gamma sensitizes B cells to suboptimal mitogenic concentrations of anti-IgM antibody.\r"

Because such inhibition is highly dependent on antibody concentration and affinity, detection of anti-clonotypic antibodies to murine alloreactive T cells has been very difficult. In this report, an alternative method is described on the basis of the ability of antibodies specific for the TcR complex to activate T cells in an antigen-independent manner. The assay is based upon the observation that soluble antibodies to human T3 promote lysis of irrelevant, Fc receptor-positive targets by a human CTL line. By using this approach, an anti-TcR mAb has been identified among a panel of murine mAb generated against an alloreactive CTL clone. Induction of lysis by soluble anti-TcR mAb has been shown to require both the expression of Fc receptors on the target cell and conjugate formation between the effector and the target cell. This assay provides a screening procedure that is much more sensitive than inhibition of function, and it preferentially detects antibodies specific for cell surface molecules involved in T cell activation.\r"

Histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells induced by anti-rat IgE was, however, inhibited by both nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium with IC30 values of 1.1 X 10(-6) M and 5.5 X 10(-7) M, respectively. Both compounds induce phosphorylation of a 78,000 m.w. protein in the rat peritoneal mast cell in the absence of any stimulus at the same concentrations as those required to inhibit histamine release stimulated by anti-IgE. This event may be part of a feedback mechanism to limit degranulation. Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium were equipotent in their ability to inhibit anti-IgE-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, but differed markedly in their ability to inhibit histamine release from macaque BAL cells.\r"
