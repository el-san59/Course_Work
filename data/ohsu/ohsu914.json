The introduction of a child-match procedure may have led to a lower degree of HLA well-matched grafts because of the small size of the pediatric waiting list. The poor results obtained in the group of children aged less than 6 years may have been due to a difference in physical condition at the moment of transplantation. This may explain why 4 of 20 (20%) of the failures in that age-group were due to patient death. The best results with the child-match procedure were obtained if the donor and recipient were both aged between 6 and 15 years. The overall graft survival in all children was improved by the use of Cs. An increase of approximately 10% was observed in this group of patients. The numbers in this group are too small, however, to permit any meaningful analysis of the influence of Cs on HLA matching. Finally, the overall results in this report demonstrate that renal transplantation is an effective form of therapy for end-stage renal disease in children.\r"

Short-term viability was inversely proportional to the ammonia concentration of the medium and was independent of the ammonium concentration and pH. The NH3-induced ameba killing was associated with a cellular alkalosis and cell swelling. While short-term trophozoite viability was unaffected by changes in the medium pH over the range 5.5-8.0, long-term viability was reduced by high pH, and of three pH values tested (6.27, 7.27, and 8.27), trophozoite growth was greatest at the lower value. Chemotaxis was observed in media over the pH range 5.5-8.0, and attenuated chemotaxis was observed in trophozoites in media containing NH3 (0.1 mM). The cecal content total ammonia concentration and pH and the in vivo mucosal microclimate pH were measured in young adult male rats, hamsters, and gerbils. Ceca of the three rodent species were also inoculated with HM-38 trophozoites and 7 days later the cecal contents were studied for signs of amebic infection. Infections were absent in the rat, the species with highest luminal total ammonia concentration and mucosal microclimate pH. All gerbils were infected. This species had the lowest mucosal microclimate pH. The hamster, with the intermediate microclimate pH, had a low infection rate (1 of 5). It is proposed that when ammonium diffuses from the large intestinal lumen into a more basic mucosal microclimate, it is converted to ammonia, and the combination of this ammonia and the high microclimate pH threatens Entamoeba trophozoite viability and reduces the probability of a given ameba penetrating the mucus blanket and invading the mucosal epithelium.\r"

Larvae are pretreated in 10% bile at 37 degrees C for 1 hr to induce an increase in surface permeability, than incubated in 20% v/v ethanediol at 37 degrees C for 10 min, transferred to 0 degrees C for a second incubation step of 15 min in a v/v mixture of 33% ethanediol: 33% methanol: 34% saline at 0 degrees C followed by rapid cooling (approximately 5,100 degrees C min-1) of aliquots distributed onto glass coverslips. The larvae are thawed by dropping the coverslips into 2 ml saline at room temperature (20 degrees C) and immediately agitating, which simultaneously dilutes (1:100) the cryoprotectants. Groups of 6 mice were infected with muscle stage larvae by gastric intubation. Five days post-infection 14.5 +/- 3.2% of control untreated unfrozen MSL and 16.5 +/- 4.1% of unfrozen bile and cryoprotectant treated controls were recovered as adult worms from the small intestine. Of the cryopreserved larvae, 1.1 +/- 0.4% were recovered as adults, which represents 7.6% compared to the untreated unfrozen controls. When the bile pretreatment step was omitted fewer adult worms (0.09 +/- 0.04%) were recovered and no second generation muscle stage larvae were produced. Modifying this technique by omitting the first incubation step in 20% ethanediol and extending the second incubation step to 25 min yielded 72.3% recovery of T. nativa adult worms 5 days post-infection compared to unfrozen controls. The reproductive capacity index of bile treated cryopreserved T. spiralis was 2.5 +/- 0.6 compared to 51.8 +/- 18.8 for normal muscle stage controls.\r"

This is the first report of the parasite from North America. A carnivorous snail, Euglandina rosea, was found experimentally to be able to serve as both an intermediate and a paratenic host. Other locally occurring gastropods that were successfully infected experimentally included Mesodon thyroidus, Anguispira alternata, Bradybaena similaris, Subulina octona, Polygyra triodontoides, Vaginulus ameghini, Philomycus carolinianus, Deroceras laeve, Limax flavus, and Lehmannia poirieri. Laboratory reared, 4- to 5-week-old M. thyroidus and D. laeve were able to support the development of small numbers of larvae to the third stage. First stage larvae of A. cantonensis in the feces of experimentally infected rats were found not to migrate out of the fecal pellet; this behavior favors the infection of feces-consuming gastropods. Twenty heavily infected L. flavus were observed over a period of 2 months, and shedding of third stage larvae of A. cantonensis was never seen. While factors support the spread of A. cantonensis in rats in the southern United States, the probability of human infection is uncertain since the parasite is transmitted primarily by ingestion of raw intermediate and paratenic hosts.\r"

These mast cells can degranulate in response to worm antigens, and this event has been suggested to play a protective role for the host. To examine whether mast cells in higher animals play a role in protecting from disseminated parasitic disease, mast cell numbers and responsiveness to parasite antigens were evaluated in 5 Erythrocebus patas infected with the human intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. Initial infection and subsequent challenge infections were associated with increase in jejunal histamine and mast cell numbers, and these mast cells could release histamine in response to parasite antigens. Jejunal mast cell numbers returned to normal during a chronic phase of infection. The cells lost their ability to respond to antigenic stimulation following limited steroid treatment. Subsequent activation of chronic infections to fatal disseminated disease by more prolonged steroid treatment was associated with a marked decrease in jejunal mast cell numbers and histamine. In one animal which succumbed to severe disease without steroid treatment, jejunal mast cells were refractory to worm antigens.\r"

A total of 384 people participated in the DEC-C regimens, and all pregnant women and children under 2 years were excluded from the study. Bekessy's method of estimation of incidence and recovery rates was applied to data on B. malayi microfilaremia before drug administration. Treatment with DEC-C by any of the 3 modes of delivery drastically reduced the number of episodes of patent microfilaremia, incidence and prevalence, and median microfilarial density. Reduction was sustained for at least 18 to 24 months after treatment.\r"

The indications and intensity of anticoagulant therapy in patients with valvular heart disease and prosthetic valves are first discussed. We recommend that the prothrombin time be reported as a ratio and standardized using the International Normalized Ratio. The pivotal role of platelets and the clotting system in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and the acute coronary syndromes is described. There is no evidence to date that antiplatelet therapy is of value in primary prevention or in patients with stable angina, but the value of aspirin in patients with unstable angina was clearly shown in two well-designed studies. Adequate prophylactic therapy to prevent the thrombotic complications of acute myocardial infarction (i.e., venous thrombosis and intracardiac thrombosis) is described, and the available data on the prevention of coronary reocclusion after thrombolysis reviewed. There is now convincing evidence from studies in animals and in patients that vascular injury during aortocoronary vein bypass graft surgery requires antitihrombotic therapy starting before the procedure to minimize acute platelet thrombus deposition and prevent occlusion. Restenosis after arterial angioplasty appears to be related to acute platelet thrombus deposition on the site of deep arterial injury. Therapeutic interventions should probably involve both anticoagulants and platelet inhibitor therapy. Implications derived from recent animal studies are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a 14-day course of ancrod on fibrinolysis, renal function and structure, and immunologic findings are reported in 37 patients with glomerulonephritis. Patients were divided into two groups. In the first, the level of fibrin degradation products within 48 h was relatively low (less than 1 mg/ml). In these patients there was a linear relationship between changes in levels of fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen, suggesting that fibrin degradation products derived from ancrod-cleaved-fibrinogen in the circulating pool; in most, level of plasma alpha 2-antiplasmin before treatment was elevated. In the second, the level of fibrin degradation products within 48 h was high (greater than 1 mg/ml). Compared with the change in fibrinogen, a disproportionate increase in levels of fibrin degradation products suggested that a significant amount derived from sources other than plasmin digested ancrod-cleaved-fibrinogen, thus reflecting effective fibrinolysis, perhaps also in tissues; in most, the level of plasma alpha 2-antiplasmin was normal before treatment. In those with initial high levels of fibrin degradation products, higher levels persisted throughout treatment, changes in other fibrinolysis components were greater, and plasminogen activator inhibitor levels became normal. In patients with initial high but not with initial low response in fibrin degradation products renal function improved within 24 to 48 h and continued to improve thereafter; there was an immediate but temporary increase in proteinuria. Microvascular thrombosis decreased significantly, indicating effective removal of fibrin from glomeruli. The relation of early fibrinolysis to changes in immunologic and histopathologic findings was analyzed in patients with lupus nephritis. With ancrod, there was an increase toward normal of serum C3 and C4, a decrease in serum Igs, gamma globulin and anti-dsDNA antibody and in glomerular C3 and Ig deposits, suggesting that ancrod had favorable effects on immunologic factors. There were no clinical differences in patients with initial high and low responses, but the relationship of microvascular and inflammatory indexes before treatment differed. Initial renal biopsies and those after treatment were carried out on average 28 days apart. Inflammatory and microvascular indexes and glomerular thrombi decreased in patients with initial high levels of fibrin degradation products; fibrosclerosis index and glomerular sclerosis increased in patients with initial low levels of fibrin degradation products. Fibrinolysis expressed as the 48 h (fibrin degradation products/fibrinogen) ratio, correlated inversely with change in fibrosclerosis index and glomerular sclerosis in the whole group, and especially in those with initial high levels of fibrin degradation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Its role in diagnosis consists of demonstration of ventricular and atrial chamber dilation and assessment of left ventricular systolic function. A subgroup of patients with depressed function but with no significant left ventricular dilation are described. Echocardiographic detection of intracavitary thrombi in the left ventricular cavity has a high predictive accuracy in excess of 90%. The pathophysiology of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation in relation to annular size, valve dysfunction, and chamber dilation is readily assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. The Doppler methods are useful to measure cardiac output, to quantify pulmonary hypertension, and to assess left ventricular systolic and diastolic functional abnormalities. An important role of echocardiography in prognosis relates to predictive value of M-mode parameters of left ventricular size, wall thickness, and function in long-term survival, as observed in a prospective multicenter study.\r"

Of the cardiomyopathies of unknown cause, the dilated type is the most common. The anatomic diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based on several morphologic features, the most important of which are asymmetric septal hypertrophy, small left ventricular cavity, and myocardial fiber disarray. Endomyocardial fibrosis with or without peripheral eosinophilia represents the unknown type of restrictive or obliterative form of cardiomyopathy. Selective specific heart muscle diseases (amyloid, iron, myocarditis, toxic, storage disease) are briefly reviewed.\r"

Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography are powerful noninvasive tools in the assessment of the anatomic and functional characteristics of these disorders. With cardiac amyloidosis as the prototype, the constellation of findings of a small or normal left ventricular cavity size; markedly increased thickness of the ventricular walls, associated with a highly abnormal texture; and biatrial enlargement make up its characteristic appearance. However, there is a wide spectrum of abnormalities in this disorder, depending on the stage and duration of heart involvement. Doppler assessment of diastolic function is frequently abnormal in cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis usually is evident by a dilated segmental cardiomyopathy with regional wall abnormalities. Similarly, hemochromatosis appears as a dilated cardiomyopathy with normal wall thickness. The echocardiographic appearance of glycogen and glycolipid storage diseases is similar to cardiac amyloidosis, and biochemical analysis may be necessary for differentiation. Thus echocardiography is an important tool in the characterization of infiltrative cardiomyopathies.\r"

In Chagas' heart disease a left ventricular apical aneurysm is characteristic, but in contrast to coronary artery disease, septal involvement is minimal. In endomyocardial fibrosis apical obliteration with a small inwardly moving left ventricular cavity, large atria, and atrioventricular valvular insufficiency are typical features. It is the aim of this article to present the characteristic echocardiographic findings with these conditions and thereby facilitate the recognition when they appear in nonendemic areas.\r"

However, ascertainment of the cause of a particular cardiomyopathy (e.g., ischemia versus inflammation as the cause of a dilated myopathy) with ultrasound would be greatly facilitated by analysis of myocardial composition with ultrasound tissue characterization techniques. Qualitative observations have identified unusual echocardiographic image texture in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in amyloidosis. Quantitative observations have verified these findings and have identified increased ultrasound backscatter in regions of myocardial fibrosis, calcification, and anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Although several technical problems remain unsolved and further research is needed in the mechanisms of normal and abnormal ultrasound/tissue interactions, tissue characterization with ultrasound has the potential to contribute independent information on myocardial composition in patients with cardiomyopathy.\r"

Left ventricular wall motion score (WMS), left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI), and pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) were obtained in 77 patients without clinical signs of heart failure. Progression into Killip grade 3 or 4 was found in 16 of 77 patients (21%) within 32 +/- 6 hours (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) after admission. Mean WMS, LVSWI, and PCP in those patients who developed severe pump failure were significantly different from those who did not: 13.4 +/- 4.9 versus 7.3 +/- 4, 30 +/- 4 versus 46 +/- 11 gm/m2, and 21 +/- 8 versus 12 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively. Sensitivity of WMS of greater than 7 and LVSWI of less than 35 gm/m2 in predicting Killip grade 3 or 4 was 88% and 94%, specificity was 57% and 87%, positive predictive value was 35% and 65%, and negative predictive value was 95% and 98%. Sensitivity of PCP was low (50%). Early identification of patients developing myocardial rupture or reinfarction was limited by both methods. We conclude that echocardiographic examination on admission in patients with acute myocardial infarction provides an alternative approach for early identification of low-risk patients.\r"

Eighteen studies resulting in data on 1105 patients with normally functioning prosthetic valves were reviewed. Significant differences among the various types and sizes of prosthetic valves were found in both the aortic and mitral positions.

  ".W": "Fetal echocardiography has allowed prenatal diagnosis of heart disease to become a reality over the last decade. Recently, pulsed Doppler flow studies have been applied to the examination of the fetal cardiovascular system. In fetuses with dysrhythmias, complex structural heart malformations, nonimmune hydrops fetalis, or mothers receiving nonsteroidal prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, pulsed Doppler echocardiographic studies are clinically indicated. These studies involve noninvestigational tests that provide information of critical clinical import. These studies may occasionally, require energy intensities that exceed the 510(k) limits. The physician should be held responsible for educating patients to the potential risks versus benefits of any imaging study they undergo, but appending potentially alarming labels to transducers, machines, or cathode-ray tube displays can only serve to undermine the fabric of the physician-patient relationship without achieving the desired goal of protection of the patient.\r"

This included not only specialized sessions, predominantly attended by echocardiographers, but the clinical and surgical sessions dealing with virtually any and all forms of heart disease. This is a versatility of which we can be justifiably proud. The newer technique of catheter-mounted ultrasound transducers for intravascular imaging is exciting, and we all await further developments in this field. Finally, it would appear the ground is still fertile for investigation into left ventricular function as it relates to acute myocardial infarction in an era of evermore frequent intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography generally has superior sensitivity and image quality compared with precordial echocardiography. Its unique anatomic perspective posterior to the heart often provides important clinical information not obtainable by other imaging approaches and technologies. It is particularly useful in the diagnosis of mitral valve disease, left atrial masses, endocarditis and its sequelae, and aortic dissections. It is also useful for examination of the left main coronary artery, left ventricular outflow tract, atrial and ventricular septa, and congenital defects. In addition to its application as a diagnostic tool in conscious patients, it can be employed intraoperatively to evaluate and guide surgical intervention. Detection of ventricular wall motion abnormalities by transesophageal echocardiography has been shown to be the most sensitive indicator of myocardial ischemia available in the clinical setting. It has potential for wide application for safely monitoring left ventricular function in patients in intensive care or under anesthesia.\r"

In a first consecutive series of 56 patients, two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography and pulsed wave Doppler (PWD) studies were performed within a 24-hour interval of a conventional contrast aortic angiography, which showed AR in 46 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of PWD in the detection of AR were both 100%. To quantitate AR, a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) PWD mapping was scored. Significant differences between 1, 2, and 3 to 4 angiographic grades of AR were obtained. As some overlap existed between groups, a multifactorial analysis of PWD and echocardiographic measurements was performed: optimal discrimination was obtained when a new score combining LVOT mapping by PWD, diastolic left ventricular diameter, and aortic root dimension was considered. A prospective validation of this combined echocardiographic-Doppler method was then applied on a second group of 31 catheterized patients with AR. Correlation obtained (r = 0.86; p less than 0.001) confirmed the accuracy of this new method in the prediction of the severity of AR.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic signs for a flail mitral valve leaflet. This was a retrospective evaluation of 54 patients who had (1) significant mitral regurgitation, (2) a technically adequate echocardiographic study, and (3) description of valve anatomy done at surgery or necropsy. The following M-mode signs were examined for their ability to detect a flail valve: (1) systolic flutter of the mitral valve closure line, sensitivity 29%, specificity 76%; (2) abnormal diastolic posterior leaflet motion, sensitivity 73%, specificity 71%; (3) abnormal diastolic anterior leaflet motion, sensitivity 67%, specificity 86%; (4) systolic atrial echoes, sensitivity 28%, specificity 68%; (5) multiple independent systolic closure lines, sensitivity 71%, specificity 52%. The two-dimensional echocardiographic signs evaluated were (1) diastolic inversion of the anterior leaflet toward the left atrium, sensitivity 29%, specificity 96%; (2) diastolic inversion of the posterior leaflet toward the left atrium, sensitivity 54%, specificity 93%, (3) systolic inversion of the anterior leaflet into the left atrium, sensitivity 57%, specificity 93%; (4) systolic inversion of the posterior leaflet into the left atrium, sensitivity 79%, specificity 86%; (5) systolic whipping of the mitral leaflets, sensitivity 73%, specificity 74%; (6) presence of floating apical chordae, sensitivity 30%, specificity 91%. Doppler echocardiographic signs evaluated were (1) presence of left atrial systolic antegrade flow, sensitivity 30%, specificity 91%; (2) vertical striations superimposed on the typical regurgitant flow pattern, sensitivity 75%, specificity 69%. When all the two-dimensional signs except systolic whipping and the M-mode signs for abnormal diastolic leaflet motion were combined, the sensitivity for detecting a flail mitral valve was maximized at 97%, but specificity was reduced to 64%. In conclusion, two-dimensional echocardiographic signs are more sensitive and specific than either M-mode or Doppler signs for detecting a flail mitral valve. The various M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic signs, however, are complementary to each other, and sensitivity is maximized when they are combined.\r"

Of the remaining 22 who were placed on continuous steroids, only 12 met rejection criteria and either some or all of the remainder probably had Cs nephrotoxicity. The patient and graft survival were better but not statistically so in the no-prednisone group (97% v 89%) and (88% v 78%), and the number of infections was only half that of the prednisone-treated group (22% v 42%).

The overall success rate was approximately 90%, with 21 of 23 corticosteroid-treated patients and ten of 12 ALG-treated patients responding to therapy. The two treatment modalities did not differ with respect to subsequent hospital admissions for fever, second rejections, graft survival, or patient survival. Corticosteroid-treated patients realized significant cost savings and required a shorter hospital stay when compared to ALG-treated patients. An alternative antirejection treatment protocol may be highly effective, safe, and cost beneficial.\r"

The majority of patients studied were cadaver transplant recipients. Renal function improved significantly in all patients following conversion. Converted patients did not demonstrate an increased incidence of rejection or hospitalization for fever or infection when compared with nonconverted, matched controls. The rate of allograft loss in converted patients did not differ from that of all nonconverted patients during the study period. The monthly cost of maintenance immunosuppression was significantly less in converted patients, resulting in an annual savings of $2,489 per patient. Posttransplant conversion from CsA to Aza appears to be safe and cost-beneficial.\r"

One hundred milliliters of stored whole blood DST, three times at weekly intervals is a practical, less immunizing and effective approach to enhance graft survival in recipients of a living-related donor kidney. 2. This protocol could also be used in sibling donor/recipient pairs who do not share a haplotype as well as in those who share two haplotypes to enhance graft survival. 3. The use of a short course of Cs (6 mg/kg/d for three weeks) along with DST appears to reduce the sensitization rate even lower. The dose of Cs used in this study produced no clinically significant adverse reactions, whereas Aza (1 mg/kg/d) often produces leukopenia. 4. DST produces significantly suppressed donor specific MLC responses in the early post-DST period; however, it increases the response at a later time. DST modulates immune responses in such a way that secondary responses upon grafting are more readily reversible by immunosuppressive agents.\r"

Accumulation was time-dependent and modestly concentration-dependent. At 0.1 mM initial external drug concentration, the ratio of drug concentration in cells:medium after 120 min was 5.5 for 3H-clindamycin, 2.8 for 3H-tetracycline, and 0.95 for 3H-dihydrostreptomycin. Corresponding values for uninfected erythrocytes were 3.2, 2.3, and 0.78, respectively. These data may explain the lack of antimalarial activity of the aminoglycosides and may partially explain the slow onset of therapeutic action of clindamycin and tetracycline. The low intracellular concentrations attained for the latter two drugs have important implications for understanding the kinetics and mechanism of their antiplasmodial effects.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to reexamine the efficacy of diethylcarbamazine for bancroftian filariasis with special reference to changes in serum parasite antigen levels and antifilarial antibody titers after treatment. Patients with asymptomatic microfilaremia were treated with 6 mg/kg diethylcarbamazine daily for 12 days. Microfilaria counts fell dramatically after treatment, as expected. IgG antibody titers to adult and microfilarial antigens of B. malayi were increased 1 month after treatment in most patients. Titers fell slowly to or below pretreatment levels, but remained positive during subsequent months. Parasite antigen levels, measured by monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay, decreased to 72%, 58%, 53%, and 48% of pretreatment values 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after diethylcarbamazine treatment, respectively. Parasite antigen levels decreased similarly in subjects with and without residual microfilaremia after treatment. These results suggest that diethylcarbamazine has only partial macrofilaricidal activity against W. bancrofti with this dosage schedule. The sustained, impressive reductions in microfilaria counts after treatment despite significant persistence of parasite antigenemia may be explained by sublethal effects of the drug on adult worms. We believe that parasite antigen detection represents a valuable new approach for monitoring the efficacy of antifilarial drug therapy which we hope will lead to improved use of existing drugs and aid in the evaluation of new drugs for filariasis.\r"

The granuloma produced after M. leprae-BCG inoculation showed a distribution pattern similar to tuberculoid granulomas. T lymphocytes bearing the CD8 phenotype (T cytotoxic/suppressor) were sequestered to the periphery of the epithelioid tubercles and T helper-inducer CD4+ lymphocytes were distributed throughout the infiltrate. Langerhans cells CD1+ were increased in the epidermis, and in dermis they were localized mainly in the mantle surrounding the granuloma. Most of the dermal infiltrate produced after the inoculation or M. leprae-BCG expresses the HLA-DR antigen. Similarly, most keratinocytes were also positive to this MHC antigen. The granulomatous response to BCG was similar to the inoculation of a mixture of M. leprae-BCG, however acid-fast bacilla were still present. The inoculation of M. leprae produced a macrophage granuloma with no clearing of the bacilla which resembles the lepromatous leprosy granuloma.\r"

Four of 12 women had serological evidence of systemic lupus. Only two of 23 pregnancies in these women were successful. Lesions in all biopsies were remarkably similar. Seven biopsies taken during or soon after pregnancy showed acute fibrinoid lesions. 'Acute' lesions consisted of fibrin thrombi in glomeruli arterioles and arteries and double contours in glomerular capillary walls. Biopsies carried out remote from pregnancy in these seven patients showed persisting double contours in glomeruli together with narrowing of arteries due to recanalizing thrombi and cellular intimal proliferation. All other biopsies showed similar lesions. The lesions were essentially the same as those of thrombotic microangiopathy and those described previously in post-partum renal failure. Renal function was severely impaired in four patients and showed moderate impairment in two patients at the time that acute thrombotic lesions were demonstrated in glomeruli. Renal function in two patients improved during plasma exchange therapy. Because all biopsies showed either acute, healing or healed, thrombotic lesions, it is proposed that these lesions are characteristic of the renal findings in patients with a lupus 'anticoagulant'. In all but two cases the acute lesions were seen during or soon after pregnancy.\r"
