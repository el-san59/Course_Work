  ".W": "Adult T cell leukemia, an endemic disease in the southwestern part of Japan, is characterized (1) by a short survival, (2) by leukemic T cells in peripheral blood that have lobulated nuclei and helper/inducer surface phenotypes, and (3) by cutaneous involvement. A 34-year-old man who had a history of atopic dermatitis was seen at our clinic because of generalized erythroderma and lymphadenopathy. His clinical course was rather chronic as compared with that of prototypic adult T cell leukemia; however, typical leukemia cells were observed in specimens taken from his peripheral blood and skin. The diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia was established by the patient's positive serum antibody reaction to adult T cell leukemia-associated antigen and monoclonal integration of virus genome in the patient's leukemia cell DNA. Interesting and characteristic of the patient were the very high levels of serum immunoglobulin E. With the use of an in vitro immunoglobulin production system with mitogen, the patient's T lymphocytes enhanced the differentiation of B cells, both from the patient and from a normal adult, into immunoglobulin E-producing cells. Therefore it may be speculated that T cells functioning as immunoglobulin E-specific helpers were transformed to leukemia cells by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Continuous antigen stimulation of the patient's atopic diathesis also may be a factor.\r"

Laboratory experiments employing a gelatin medium showed that the delivery of the cryogen is uniform over the area of application, producing a flat-bottom ice ball. In animal studies, liquid nitrogen spray produced greater depth of destruction and inflammation than Frigipoint. In preliminary clinical studies, 68 lesions, including actinic keratosis, molluscum contagiosum, verruca plana, solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, and verruca vulgaris, were treated in 16 patients. All but one resolved after cryosurgery with Frigipoint. Frigipoint is an effective, safe, and easily portable cryosurgical instrument that has a wide spectrum of dermatologic applications. It provides efficient, well-controlled focal cryosurgical treatment of multiple lesions with one immersion of the probe in liquid nitrogen. In addition, its simple operation is met with high patient and physician acceptance.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years the morbidity and mortality of asthma has increased, although the etiology is still poorly understood. Most patients with asthma suffer acute attacks that are commonly treated in hospital emergency rooms (ER). In the present study, asthma in adults was studied with acute attacks as a marker for the disease; 102 patients first observed at a university hospital ER with acute airway obstruction were compared to 118 patients observed at the same ER with any diagnosis other than shortness of breath to evaluate allergy as a risk factor for asthma in adults. Sera were assayed for IgE antibody (Ab) to dust mites, cockroach, cat dander, and grass and ragweed pollen. The results demonstrate that in adults younger than 50 years of age, the prevalence of IgE Abs was fourfold greater among subjects with asthma than among control subjects (46/67 versus 12/81; odds ratio, 10.1; 95% confidence interval, 4.9 to 20.7). The population attributable risk for the presence of IgE Ab to one of the five allergens was greater than 50%. Among individuals older than 50 years of age, the prevalence of serum IgE Abs was not significantly increased among patients with acute airway obstruction. In the whole group, the prevalence of IgE Abs to different allergens demonstrated significant seasonal and socioeconomic differences, suggesting that the associated risk is related to exposure to those allergens. The results establish that, with acute attacks of asthma as a marker for adult asthma, the presence of serum IgE Abs to common inhalant allergens is a major risk factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-two of 46 children with symptoms produced by DBPCFC to peanut were included in this longitudinal evaluation. Contact was made with the 32 subjects 2 to 14 years after their positive DBPCFC to peanut. All 32 subjects had exhibited a positive puncture skin test to peanut at the time of the original evaluation. Sixteen subjects had experienced symptoms caused by accidental peanut ingestion in the year before contact. Eight subjects had reacted to accidental ingestion in more than 1 year but less than 5 years before contact. Eight subjects had completely avoided peanut since the original evaluation and positive DBPCFC. No subjects could be demonstrated to have \"outgrown\" their peanut reactivity. All subjects tested continued to have skin reactivity to a puncture skin test with peanut extract. It appears uncommon for peanut-sensitive patients to lose their clinical reactivity, even after many years have elapsed. In addition, data were collected concerning reactions to other legumes and other (nonlegume) nuts. Only two patients with DBPCFC to peanut reacted on DBPCFC to soy or pea (one each). None of the subjects with a positive DBPCFC to peanut reacted to nonlegume nuts.\r"

Ten ragweed-allergic subjects, who had previously demonstrated a cutaneous LPR, were examined in a double-blind, crossover study. Either cetirizine, 20 mg, or placebo was administered orally once daily for 2 days before and the morning of placement of a skin chamber overlying an unroofed heat/suction-induced blister to which was added antigen or buffer. Skin test erythema was significantly reduced by cetirizine at 15 minutes, 2 hours, and 4 hours by 56%, 40%, and 39%, respectively (all, p less than or equal to 0.01), but by 6 and at 8 hours, the cutaneous erythema was not significantly lessened. Histamine release was not altered by cetirizine treatment, but prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production, which peaked at 3 to 5 hours, was clearly reduced by cetirizine treatment, being lower at all time points during the reaction; this was significant by analysis of variance (p less than or equal to 0.04). The inhibition was most marked during the fifth hour of the reaction when there was a 50% suppression of the PGD2 level by cetirizine (0.193 ng/ml to 0.075 ng/ml [p less than or equal to 0.03]). The most dramatic effect of cetirizine was attenuation of the inflammatory cell migration into the chamber. Eosinophil infiltration was decreased by about 75% during hours 6, 7, and 8 (p less than or equal to 0.04), whereas the number of neutrophils was reduced by the same magnitude at the same times (p less than or equal to 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The exact mechanism of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma is unknown. Adenosine contraction of guinea pig trachea was antagonized by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of indomethacin (100 mg/day) on adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction in 14 asymptomatic patients with asthma. Airway response was evaluated as FEV1, and adenosine was administered as an aerosol diluted in 0.9% saline to produce a concentration range of 0.125 to 4 mg/ml. The dose of adenosine producing a 20% change in FEV1 (PD20) was calculated from the individual semilogarithmic dose-response curve; the results of PD20 were converted to log values for statistical analysis (Student's paired t test). The study was performed on 3 separate days. On the first day, the adenosine challenge was performed, and on subsequent days patients were pretreated with either placebo or indomethacin in a randomized, double-blind manner. Inhaled adenosine caused bronchoconstriction with a geometric mean PD20 of 0.71 mg (95% confidence limits, 0.44 to 1.16). After placebo, a geometric mean PD20 of 0.91 mg (95% confidence limits, 0.53 to 1.58) was obtained. Indomethacin pretreatment decreased adenosine hyperresponsiveness and shifted the dose-response curves of adenosine challenge to the right with a geometric mean PD20 of 1.28 mg (95% confidence limits, 0.64 to 2.56). The effect of indomethacin on adenosine bronchoconstriction (p less than 0.01 versus baseline; p less than 0.05 versus placebo) suggests an indirect mechanism of adenosine on inducing release of arachidonic acid derivatives. Inflammatory mediators inhibited by indomethacin may be involved in adenosine bronchoconstriction, even if this mechanism is not relevant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mattress and carpet dust of bedrooms from 22 different homes constituted the house dust samples. The guanine content was determined by quantitative measurements and the mite allergenicity by two immunochemical assays with a partially purified extract of Dp as internal reference: RAST inhibition and crossed and rocket line immunoelectrophoresis. A large scale range of guanine content was obtained among the 22 house dust samples studied (0.01 to 1.78 mg/0.1 gm of dust). Data of RAST inhibition, analyzed according to parallel line bioassay, demonstrated no significant difference between the slopes of the reference and the house dust sample lines, but a 100-fold variation in the relative Dp potencies was observed. By crossed and rocket line immunoelectrophoresis technique, the presence and the amounts of major Dp allergens (Der p I and Dp 4) were established in most house dust extracts. A significant correlation was found between the guanine content of the house dust samples and their relative Dp potencies (r = 0.86) on the one hand, and with their relative content of Der p I and Dp 4, two major Dp allergens (r = 0.75 and r = 0.74, respectively) on the other hand; in each case, a quantitative relationship was established. These results suggest that the guanine determination could assess mite allergens in house dust and may be a useful tool in large-scale investigations of house dust.\r"

The effect of the orally active leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonist LY171883 (LY) (400 mg) on antigen or LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction and wheal-and-flare responses was studied in atopic subjects on six occasions (three groups of 2 consecutive days). On the first 2 study days, subjects were screened for their response to inhaled LTD4 and antigen. On the second and third groups of 2 study days, subjects received LY, 400 mg, or placebo 2 hours before inhaled leukotriene LTD4 or antigen challenge. After antigen challenge, the lung function was measured for 6 hours. After the inhaled challenge, intradermal LTD4 and antigen challenges were performed. LY had no effect on baseline lung function. Geometric mean (95% confidence intervals) for the provocative dose of LTD4 causing a 40% fall in forced expiratory flow at 40% vital capacity from a forced expiratory flow maneuver was 1.8 (0.5 to 5.6) nmol after placebo and 5.6 (2.0 to 15.7) nmol after LY. This difference was not significant. The mean maximum change during the early phase of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction was reduced, being 54.7 (26.9% to 82.4%) after placebo and 35.8 (2.3% to 69.3%) after LY (p less than 0.05). There was, however, no difference in the maximum response observed during the late phase. There was also a significant reduction in the area under the curve of the early but not late-phase response to antigen. LY significantly shifted the intradermal LTD4 dose-response curve for both wheal and flare to the right (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nasal resistance was measured by posterior rhinometry under control conditions and after log incremental doses of histamine solution pipetted into the nose (0.5 to 5000 micrograms). Allergic subjects exhibited a twofold rise of nasal resistance with doses of 0.5, 5, or 50 micrograms of histamine, whereas the nasal resistance in normal subjects remained unchanged until 500 or 5000 micrograms of histamine had been administered. Nasal reactivity to histamine was not correlated with symptoms on the day of testing but was correlated with the number of positive wheals to skin prick testing. It was concluded that nasal resistance is more sensitive to histamine in subjects with allergic rhinitis than in normal control subjects and that this difference may be used as the basis of a diagnostic test.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the modulatory effects of catecholamines on the respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), dopamine was tested for its capacity to modify the superoxide anion (O2-) production by PMNs under their stimulation with several stimuli. Dopamine inhibited the O2- production by PMNs when PMNs were stimulated with N-formylated chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), phorbol myristate acetate, or opsonized zymosan, whereas dopamine did not alter the PMN mobility. The values of percentage inhibition of the O2- production by FMLP-stimulated PMNs were 57% under treatment with 10(-5) mol/L and 83% with 10(-4) mol/L of dopamine. Isoproterenol also inhibited PMN O2- production in response to FMLP. Although a beta-adrenergic blockade, propranolol, diminished the isoproterenol-induced inhibition of the O2- production, it did not affect the inhibitory effect of dopamine. The increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels in dopamine-treated PMNs was much smaller than the increase in isoproterenol-treated cells. Furthermore, dopamine inhibited the reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent O2- production by subcellular particles. These results indicate that dopamine inhibits PMN O2- production through its effect on PMN reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase system rather than through its beta-adrenergic action.\r"

Rhinoscopy and rhinomanometry were performed 20 times on each of 14 subjects during 14 to 26 minutes. The procedure was videotaped, and nasal airway area was measured from a video monitor. The mean coefficients of variation for rhinoscopy and rhinomanometry were 14% and 19%, respectively. Another investigator examined five subjects by rhinoscopy 30 times in 15 minutes; the mean coefficient of variation was 9%. These means were not significantly different. Rhinoscopy and rhinomanometry were performed at 30-minute intervals for a 6-hour period in 13 subjects. Three investigators independently evaluated results for changes in nasal function characteristic of the nasal cycle. Rhinoscopy detected the nasal cycle in an average of 72% of subjects and rhinomanometry in 49%. Both methods detected the response to topically applied oxymetazoline and methacholine. Results indicate that, whereas the two procedures evaluate different aspects of nasal function, their precision is similar. Rhinoscopy additionally permits evaluation of nasal mucosal changes occurring from disease or treatment.\r"

Each patient received three treatment combinations assigned with a balanced incomplete block design. Nedocromil sodium administered before antigen challenge was significantly more effective than placebo in blocking both the early (p less than 0.001) and late (p less than 0.01) fall in FEV1. Postchallenge administration of nedocromil sodium tended to delay the onset of late asthmatic reaction but did not provide significant protection compared to placebo. These results demonstrated that nedocromil sodium prevents both phases of the dual asthmatic reaction to bronchial antigen provocation when it is inhaled before challenge. Further investigation is necessary to elicit a definite answer to whether nedocromil sodium administered after bronchial challenge has an effect on late asthmatic reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Among the mediators involved in the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underly the reactions of the acute and delayed phases of bronchospasm induced by allergens in man, platelet-activating factor (PAF) could play an important role, in particular by its effects on platelets. In animals, inhalation or injection of PAF causes a platelet-dependent bronchoconstriction that is blocked by prior administration of an antiplatelet antiserum and accompanied by platelet accumulation in the pulmonary vessels. In man, inhalation of PAF causes a bronchospasm and induces a bronchial hyperreactivity. Abnormalities of platelet aggregation and the secretion into plasma of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin have been described in patients with asthma during induced bronchospasm. Platelet functions have been studied in 15 patients with asthma before and after allergen bronchial provocation tests. There was no difference between platelet counts, plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin, and platelet aggregation induced by several agonists (adrenaline, arachidonic acid, or PAF) before and immediately after the allergen bronchial provocation test. There was no platelet pulmonary sequestration as studied with 111Indium-labeled platelets during 24 hours after the antigen challenge, and the life span of circulating platelets was normal. Our results do not support an important direct role for PAF in the pathophysiology of asthma. It is still possible that the current methodology is too insensitive to detect amounts of PAF in the circulation or that PAF is acting locally.\r"

Several studies have suggested that visual impairment contributes to falls, but studies have not used standardized definitions of visual impairment and have not examined injurious falls or fractures. We looked at the risk of hip fracture associated with visual impairment in those members of the Framingham Study Cohort who took part in the Framingham Eye Study in 1973-75. Of 2,633 subjects followed for 10 years after the eye exam, 110 sustained hip fractures. The fracture rates in those with moderately impaired (20/30 to 20/80) vision (8.5%) and poor (20/100 or worse) vision (11.3%) were higher than in those with good (20/25 or better) vision (3.0%). After adjustment for age, sex, weight, alcohol consumption, and (in women) estrogen use, the relative risk of fracture in those with moderate impairment was 1.54 (95% CI = 0.95-2.49), while for those with poor vision, the relative risk was 2.17 (95% CI = 1.24-3.80). Of note, those with moderately impaired vision in one eye and good vision in the other had a higher risk of fracture (relative risk = 1.94) than those with a similar degree of binocular impairment (relative risk = 1.11). Poor vision in one or both eyes was linked to an elevated fracture risk. This suggests that good stereoscopic vision may be necessary to prevent falls. The risk of fracture with poor and moderately impaired vision combined was increased in women (relative risk = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.23-3.11) but not in men (relative risk = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.23-2.72).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At discharge, hypochondriasis was present in 40% of the sample, with 0% delusional. Hypochondriasis was associated with anxiety (P less than .05) and somatic concerns (P less than .001), but not with complaints of depressed mood, suicidality, or short-term outcome. In dependent physical illness ratings did not correlate with hypochondriasis, however nonpsychotropic medication use did (P less than .01). Improvement in hypochondriacal complaints with treatment, yet persistence of less intense hypochondriacal concerns after remission suggests that these features may represent an admixture of state and trait phenomena in elderly depressives.\r"

Vinpocetine failed to improve cognition on psychometric testing or overall functioning, as measured by the clinical global impression, at any dose tested. Patients showed significant decline in most measures during the course of the study, at the same rate as a matched control group, consistent with progressive dementia. There were no significant side effects from drug therapy. We conclude that vinpocetine is ineffective in improving cognitive deficits and does not slow the rate of decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Furthermore, postural hypotension may be related to baseline blood pressure. In this study, the influence of age and blood pressure on the hemodynamic and plasma catecholamine responses to orthostatic stress was investigated in young and old normotensive and hypertensive healthy subjects. In normotensive and hypertensive elderly persons, the percentage blood pressure responses during tilt were not significantly different from that seen in young normotensives. We measured a slight decrease of systolic blood pressure and a slight increase of diastolic blood pressure. The hypertensive young patients showed an enhanced diastolic blood pressure response with no fall in systolic blood pressure, in contrast to the normotensive young subjects. Both elderly groups had a lower increase of heart rate than the young subjects. The percentage increase in norepinephrine after tilting was significantly lower in elderly hypertensives than in elderly normotensives and young hypertensives. The presence of hypertension was associated with a decrease in blood pressure, but age had no influence on the change in blood pressure during tilt. In this group of healthy elderly subjects, there was no significant orthostatic hypotension when the blood pressure course of the entire tilt test was taken into account.\r"

Conversely, in the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, only 6% had bacterial infection.

Most patients with capacity who chose DNR had multiple sclerosis, while most choosing CODE had strokes. Most patients who lacked capacity had dementia. Forty-five percent of surrogates did not respond regarding CODE status during the three-month study interval, and 10% wanted additional time to decide. Patient age appeared to be a factor in surrogate choice for DNR but not in patients with capacity making their own decision. Reasons for patients with capacity choosing DNR are discussed; perceived quality of life and premorbid feelings by patients help in the decision-making process.\r"

We also examined the impact of education and incentive on increasing the awareness and ability of physicians to diagnose the disorder. Chronic salicylate intoxication was defined by 1) a compatible clinical syndrome; 2) a serum level in the toxic range; and 3) improvement with withdrawal of the drug. Patients with chronic salicylism represent a cross-section of an elderly population. Our review suggests that diminished body mass, concurrent administration of drugs and conditions which exacerbate renal insufficiency may predispose to salicylate intoxication; however, few specific precipitants of chronic salicylism were recognized. Salicylate intoxication should be considered in all elderly patients with delirium and/or dementia.\r"

Cocaine (10(-6)M) and metanephrine (10(-5)M) were added to the perfusion fluid separately and in combination to block neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms, respectively. The amount of NE overflow in the effluent was significantly lower with increasing age at any given frequency of nerve stimulation. Metanephrine increased NE overflow in heart preparations of 12- and 24-month-old animals only. Yohimbine, a selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist at concentrations of 10(-6)M and 3 x 10(-6)M significantly increased the amount of NE overflow only in the perfusion effluent of hearts isolated from 6-month-old animals. These results suggest that extraneuronal uptake mechanisms increase with age and that presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated autoregulation of NE decreases with age. The findings could account, at least in part, for the decrease in adrenergic control of the heart shown to occur with age.\r"

At 10 mos, the decidual cell response (DCR) was induced in all groups and measured by uterine weight gain, alkaline phosphatase activity, and DNA content. The DCR was also examined in young (4.5 mos) mice. LOVX and, to a lesser extent, food restriction (FR) potentiated the DCR, as indicated by 20-75% greater alkaline phosphatase activity and uterine weight relative to age-matched controls. In contrast to previous reports, however, there was no age-related reduction of the DCR. These results show that both LOVX and FR can enhance uterine function in middle-aged mice and indicate that, under some experimental conditions, there is no age-related impairment in the DCR.\r"

In rats fed the same diet, on alternate days from weaning, the receptor capacity did not increase significantly between 6 and 24 months (10.20 +/- 0.55 vs 9.20 +/- 0.72 fmol/mg) or between 24 and 30 months. This was not due to acute dietary deprivation, as rats food-restricted for only 2 weeks, at 23.5 months of age, also showed elevated receptor capacities compared to 6-month-old ad libitum fed animals. Moreover, intermittent feeding produced no significant effects among 6-month-old animals, whether restricted since weaning or for two weeks prior to sacrifice. Many biochemical parameters that decrease with aging in rats fed ad libitum are prevented by dietary restriction. Our results demonstrate that a reproducible biochemical process that increases with aging is also prevented with dietary restriction. The age-related, liver beta-receptor increase may be a potentially reliable marker for studying biochemical perturbations that modify life span.\r"

Fifteen young (aged 23-39 years) and eleven elderly (aged 59-82 years) volunteers participated in the study. The ratio, KL/KH, representing the ratio of dissociation constants for the low and high affinity state receptors, was calculated to determine coupling in the beta-adrenergic receptor system. An inverse correlation was observed between KL/KH and age. I25HR, representing the amount of isoproterenol required to elevate heart rate by 25 beats per minute, was determined; this parameter increased with age. Multiple regression analysis revealed that I25HR was most dependent upon age, but the changes with age were accompanied by diminution of both beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for agonist and in KL/KH.\r"

Each resident was rated independently by three nurses, one from each of the three nursing shifts. Results showed that agitated behaviors occurred most often during the day shift (i.e., when residents were most active), and least often during the night shift. The most frequently exhibited agitated behaviors were general restlessness, pacing, repetitious sentences, requests for attention, complaining, negativism, and cursing. Most agitated behaviors correlated significantly across shifts, suggesting that such behaviors occur and reoccur throughout the 24-hour day. Factor analysis yielded three syndromes of agitation: aggressive behavior, physically nonaggressive behavior, and verbally agitated behavior. These results provide a foundation for further studies of agitation in elderly persons.\r"

Results indicate that depressed elderly performance on structural language variables of repetition, naming, auditory verbal comprehension, syntax, and reading is significantly better than performance of the SDAT sample. In contrast, results suggest that in comparing normal and depressed elderly, the normal elderly have the edge. On three measures of eleven, there are significant differences between depressed and normal elderly language processing. In analyzing the measures of significant difference, it is determined that complexity is an intervening variable.

However, the older group deteriorated in motor performance from training to competition, whereas the younger group played equally well on both occasions. Results from continuous measurement of heart rate indicated a deceleration during the concentration phases among the younger players, and the magnitude of deceleration increased from training to competition. In contrast, heart rate accelerated during training among the older players, the magnitude of the heart rate change decreasing from training to competition.

Stimuli were definitions of target words, and responses were names of the target words that were defined. It has been shown previously that in this paradigm older adults are differentially inhibited by semantically related primes (Bowles & Poon, 1985a). The present experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the additional inhibition by semantically related primes resulted from a decision strategy adopted by older adults when the primes themselves were sometimes correct target words. When the correct prime condition was eliminated in the present experiment, response times were statistically the same for semantically related and unrelated conditions for both older and younger adults. This suggests that the inhibition was due to additional decision processing performed by older adults rather than to longer retrieval processing in the presence of semantically related primes.\r"

Thirty-six younger and 36 older adults studied antonym pairs, half of which were intact and half of which were missing two adjacent interior letters requiring active encoding (generation) to complete the word. In general, older adults studied items longer; both younger and older adults studied items requiring generation longer than intact items. Subsequent recognition testing also revealed age-related memory differences and generation effect-related memory improvements, but no age by task interaction. Cautiousness data showed only differences due to encoding task with no age-related differences to indicate older adults were more cautious than younger adults. Response time data also revealed expected effects due to age-related slowing and generation (not previously demonstrated in the literature).\r"

Measurement error variances associated with certain items in the older generation are significantly greater than those in the middle-aged and young generations. In addition, socioeconomic characteristics, acculturation, and health status fail to explain the observed differences in the structure of the CES-D among the three generations.\r"

A probability sample of 5,055 noninstitutionalized elderly persons in Shanghai was tested directly during the first phase of the study using a Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Details of sampling design and data collection procedures are described. Overall, some 4.1 percent of adults 55 years or older may be classified as having severe cognitive impairment, and 14.4 percent are mild cases. The rates for females are higher than for males by a ratio of 3.75 in the severe category, and 2.6 in the mild group. Within each age group, cognitive impairment rates vary by education. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine, within each age group, the nature of the association between the presence of a cognitive impairment and educational level controlling for sex. The results showed that educational attainment has a highly significant inverse relationship with prevalence of cognitive impairments (severe vs others). On the other hand, when educational attainment was controlled for in the logistic regression model, sex was significantly associated with prevalence of cognitive disorders for the age groups 65-74 and 75 years or older, but not for the group 55-64 years. These findings suggest the impact that basic educational deficits have on human cognitive functioning as measured through tests like the MMSE. Cross-tabulations of impairment rates according to marital status, economic status, and health-related problems are also presented.\r"

  ".W": "A factor in medium conditioned by mouse tumor cells was shown previously to suppress the capacity of mouse peritoneal macrophages to undergo a respiratory burst and to kill protozoal pathogens (macrophage deactivation factor, MDF). Recently, pure transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) proved to be a potent macrophage deactivator as well. Two lines of evidence suggest that MDF is not identical with TGF-beta. First, rabbit anti-TGF-beta IgG neutralized the respiratory burst-suppressing activity of TGF-beta without affecting the bioactivity of MDF, even when the latter was treated with acid to activate potentially latent TGF-beta. Second, in contrast to MDF, which decreases the affinity of the NADPH oxidase for NADPH, permeabilized macrophages that had been deactivated with TGF-beta displayed the same Km and Vmax of the oxidase as activated macrophages. As with MDF, TGF-beta had no effect on two other potential control points over the secretion of respiratory burst products, namely, hydrogen peroxide catabolism or glucose uptake. Finally, neither MDF nor TGF-beta affected the extent or affinity of binding of phorbol diesters to macrophages, the activity or cofactor requirements for protein kinase C, or the ability of protein kinase C to translocate quantitatively from cytosol to membrane fractions in response to phorbol diesters. Thus, 1) MDF is not identical with TGF-beta, and 2) in contrast to the activation or deactivation of macrophages by numerous other agents, TGF-beta regulates macrophage respiratory burst capacity at a level other than the apparent affinity of the oxidase for its substrate.\r"

By using this immunization combination, a panel of 10 mAb with specificity for determinants encoded by the Q region was produced. These reagents were analyzed for strain distribution by microcytotoxicity, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry assays. Competitive inhibition analyses, performed by using fluorescein-labeled antibodies and normal spleen cells, defined at least three epitope clusters, or groups of spatially related determinants, detected by this panel. One epitope cluster was unique to this new series of antibodies in that it was not detected with seven previously described anti-Qa mAb. These antibodies also have been analyzed for reactivity with products of isolated Q-region genes by using transfected cell lines. The data indicate that the Q6d, Q7d, and Q10d genes encode determinants reactive with one or more mAb and that two of the three epitope clusters defined with normal cells map to the N and/or C2 domains of these molecules. The third epitope cluster is presumed to map to the C2 domain. These reagents should be useful in determining the number of Q-region genes expressed and in analyses of Q gene expression in subpopulations of normal cells, in transfected cell lines, and during differentiation and ontogeny.\r"

  ".W": "The nucleotide sequence of partial cDNA clones coding for the core protein of a human polymorphic epithelial mucin has recently been obtained, this mucin consists of a highly conserved 60 bp tandem repeat and the amino acids commonly found are PDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGVTSA. We synthesized three peptides, 1) P1.24 containing the 20 amino acids and four amino acids (PDTR) of the adjoining repeat; 2) P1.15 consisting of the first fifteen (PDTRPAPGSTAPPAH) and P1.09 the second nine amino acids (GVTSAPDTR) of peptide P1.24. The reactivities of the synthetic peptides with mAb known to react with breast cancer (BC1, BC2, BC3, HMFG-1, 3E1.2, and RCC-1) were studied. The synthetic peptide, P1.24, corresponding to the antigenic sequence predicted from the tandem repeat reacted with antibodies BC1, BC2, and BC3 (known to react with human milk mucin and mucin expressed in breast cancer) and the antibody HMFG-1 which was used to select the cDNA clones. In addition, the epitopes recognized by BC1, BC2, and BC3 appear to be in the same region of the molecule represented by their reactions with the nine amino acids in peptide P1.09 (GVTSAPDTR). By contrast, other antibodies such as 3E1.2 which reacts only weakly with components of human milk, and RCC-1 that detects a low Mr component (95 kDa) in breast cancer, had no specific reaction with the synthetic peptides, indicating that their epitopes are distinct from those of BC1, BC2, BC3, and HMFG-1. Inasmuch as the antibodies HMFG-1, BC1, BC2, and BC3 react with the fully processed milk mucin, it is likely that some of the peptide is exposed, even in the fully glycosylated molecule. Identification of the different epitopes could lead to the development of \"second generation\" mAb with enhanced specificity for breast carcinoma using the appropriate synthetic peptides as immunogens.\r"

  ".U": "89235155\r", 
  ".W": "Neutrophil emigration is a critical component of the inflammatory process and is generally thought to play a role in host defense as well as in the tissue injury that often accompanies inflammation. Most inflammatory reactions exhibit a sequence of emigrating cell types, thus clearly demonstrating that the neutrophil influx eventually ceases and that the neutrophils are then removed from the lesion. It has been our premise that in order to understand the processes that lead to the progressive inflammatory reactions that underly so many disease processes, it is important to determine the mechanism by which the \"normal\" inflammatory response resolves. The purpose of this study was to identify the time of cessation of neutrophil influx in experimental arthritis induced by the injection of C5 fragments (C5f) and to investigate mechanisms underlying the cessation process. The migration of i.v. delivery pulses to inflamed joints was assessed by lavage of the joint space and by external scintigraphy. We found no evidence for the development of inhibitory systems against chemotactic factors or \"desensitization\" of the inflamed site, because a second injection of C5f into joints which had been injected previously with C5f resulted in enhancement rather than inhibition of migration. Neither was evidence found for altered tissue barriers to migration or for desensitization of neutrophils as possible explanations for cessation of influx. The major mechanism appeared to be a loss of chemoattractant activity in the joint space between 2 h and 6 h after C5f injection which was detected by transfer into a fresh joint. Radiolabeled C5a des-Arg had a t1/2 of disappearance from the joint of less than 1 h, which suggested that the transferred chemoattractant must, in part, have been due to the generation of new chemotaxins by C5f injection. These observations suggest that continued generation of chemoattractants or failure of their subsequent removal may be mechanisms leading to persistent neutrophil influx in chronic inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a highly active mediator which has been implicated in allergic inflammation and bronchial asthma, possibly by interacting with eosinophils. We have examined the effect of PAF on activation of purified human eosinophils as measured by degranulation (eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil cationic protein, arylsulfatase B, beta-glucuronidase, and alkaline phosphatase) and oxidative metabolism (superoxide anion production). PAF induced enzyme release at concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 microM in a rapid (t1/2 5 to 8 min), Ca2+-dependent and noncytotoxic manner from both the specific and small granules, whereas its biologic precursor and metabolite, lyso-PAF, had no effect. For all enzymes, maximal enzyme release occurred at 100 nM PAF with a mean ED50 value of 1.47 +/- 0.4 nM. At this concentration the mean percentage of total enzyme release by PAF from specific granules was 20.3 +/- 1.6% (17.9% for eosinophil peroxidase, 20.6% for beta-glucuronidase, 22.4% for alkaline phosphatase) and 28.8 +/- 2.2% from small granules (arylsulfatase B). Calcium ionophore A23187, PMA, and opsonized zymosan also induced eosinophil degranulation but their peak effect after 10-min incubation with maximal release 14.7%, 12.9%, or 14.1%, respectively, was lower when compared with PAF. Incubation of eosinophils with the PAF-antagonist WEB 2086 led to a parallel shift of the dose-response curve to the right, indicating a competitive antagonism. PAF also caused generation of superoxide anions by human eosinophils but this occurred at higher concentrations of PAF (1 microM to 30 microM) with an ED50 of 8.4 +/- 0.9 microM. Again, this effect was competitively inhibited by WEB 2086. These studies demonstrate that PAF activates human eosinophils to release granule constituents and generate superoxide anions. Since both PAF and eosinophil products are associated with pathogenesis of bronchial asthma our findings may be of particular pathophysiologic relevance.\r"

In studies presented here, normal monocytes were infected with the HIV-1/HTLV-IIIBa-L isolate in vitro and evaluated for chemotactic responsiveness. Within 2 days after viral exposure, but before evidence of virus production in the monocytes, chemotactic activity was significantly impaired. Decreased chemotactic activity was associated with modulation of receptors for the chemotactic ligands, C5a and FMLP, on the monocyte cell surface. In addition to HIV-1, monocytes treated with purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 demonstrated a comparable modulation of chemotactic ligand receptors and migratory function. In addition, the HIV-1 or HIV-1 gp120-treated monocytes were induced to undergo differentiation as monitored by HLA-DR expression. Immunoprecipitation of the gp120 with a specific antibody reversed its effects on monocyte chemotaxis and HLA-DR expression. Taken together, these data indicate that the initial interaction of HIV-1 with the monocyte is not passive, but that the binding of HIV-1 and/or HIV-1 gp120 to the CD4R on monocytes transduces a signal leading to transient monocyte activation.\r"

Here we report the isolation and characterization of a full length cDNA clone coding for the KS1/4 Ag, as well as, physical and biochemical studies on the antigen derived from an adenocarcinoma of the lung cell line. Affinity purification of the KS1/4 Ag reveals three glycosylated species by NaDodSO4 PAGE with molecular weights of 42, 40, and 35 kDa. The 42- and 40-kDa species are similar at the protein level, differing by their degree of glycosylation, and the 35-kDa protein results from a dibasic proteolytic cleavage of the larger m.w. species. Although both the 42- and 40-kDa forms are found on the cell surface, the 40-kDa protein appears to be the predominant species. A cDNA clone containing the complete KS1/4 coding sequence and the 5'- and 3'-non-translated regions was isolated from a library constructed from the human adenocarcinoma of the lung derived cell line, UCLA-P3. The cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 314 amino acids which includes a putative signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Northern blot analysis shows a single RNA species of 1.5-kb. Sequence analysis of the 5' and 3' noncoding regions of the KS1/4 cDNA revealed homologies to known proto-oncogenes and inflammatory mediators.\r"

  ".W": "The abundant functional polymorphism and evolutionary divergence of mammalian MHC class I genes has been affirmed recently by sequence analysis of more than 40 mouse H-2 and human HLA transcripts. In a comparative approach to the evolution of the MHC, we isolated eight molecular clones of feline MHC (termed FLA for feline leukocyte antigen) class I genes from a cDNA library of a cat T cell lymphoma line. DNA sequence analysis of eight clones revealed that they all fell into one of two internally identical allelic groups which differed by 9% of their nucleotide sequences. The occurrence of only two allelic cDNA clones is consistent with the expression of a single heterozygous functional class I gene in the studied cell line despite the occurrence of more than 20 class I copies estimated to be present in the cat genome. Comparison of the FLA class I coding sequence with other class I genes from other species revealed that the domestic cat genes display 81 to 82% sequence identity with human, and 73 to 79% sequence identity with mouse class I genes. Feline and human class I genes have similar sequences and protein structures, with three (alpha) extracellular domains, one transmembrane domain, and one cytoplasmic domain. Variable codons detected in FLA class I alleles were, in most cases, in positions which were also variable in humans and mice, whereas invariant positions with defined functional constraints were generally conserved and invariant between the three species as well. Southern analysis of DNA from diverse species of Felidae revealed a similar numerosity and restriction pattern indicating conservation of the organization of class I genes during the Felidae radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) recognizing the acetyltransferase (E2) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex have been previously well-documented and the immunodominant epitope mapped. In this study, we demonstrate that sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) react with another lipoic acid containing acyltransferase enzyme, namely the E2 of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. Indeed, 85/120 (71%) sera from patients with PBC reacted with BCKD-E2 by immunoblotting against purified BCKD complex. In contrast, sera from patients with chronic active hepatitis or progressive sclerosing cholangitis as well as sera from healthy volunteers did not react with any component enzymes of the BCKD complex. More importantly, BCKD enzyme activity was inhibited after incubation of the BCKD complex with either PBC sera against BCKD-E2 or with affinity purified antisera to BCKD-E2. Enzyme activity was unaltered by control sera or with PBC sera that reacted with PDH-E2 but not BCKD-E2. Furthermore, immunoblots of purified mitochondria probed with PBC sera absorbed with BCKD-E2 demonstrated that BCKD-E2 and PDH-E2 are each recognized by distinct AMA populations which do not cross-react. In addition, affinity purified PBC sera against BCKD-E2 did not react with PDH-E2 nor inhibit PDH enzyme activity, thus providing further evidence that BCKD-E2 and PDH-E2 are recognized by separate AMA. These data further suggest that the BCKD-E2 epitope recognized by AMA contains, or is close to, a functional domain of this enzyme. The availability of cDNA clones encoding BCKD-E2 and PDH-E2 will allow the study of how key metabolic enzymes may be involved in the immunology and pathology of PBC.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of thyroid follicular epithelial cells (TFEC) to act as APC is linked to the expression of class II (Ia) molecules of the MHC. The cloned murine thyroid-derived epithelial cell line M.5 was used to demonstrate the potential effects of virus in the direct induction of Ia molecules on TFEC. Membrane binding and replication of reovirus type 1 in TFEC was demonstrated using fluorescein-labeled antireovirus antibody and fluorescence microscopy. One consequence of the interaction between reovirus and M.5 cells was the induction of Ia Ag and augmented class I molecule expression in M.5 cells. The levels of Ia expression at three days after reovirus binding were amplified 17.3-fold over controls and were 2-fold less than that seen upon treatment of M.5 cells with IFN-gamma. Supernatant transfer experiments showed that the induction of Ia expression was directly linked to the binding of virus to M.5 cells, and was not dependent upon virus replication or the presence of IFN. These results indicate that early events of reovirus binding or receptor internalization on TFEC initiate a signaling process which results in the induction of class II and augmentation of class I MHC protein levels on the cell surface.\r"

On sucrose density gradients IgG aggregates were 11 to 19S whereas IgA aggregates were either 11S or greater than 19S. Mixed aggregates had both an 19 and 11 S peak. The isoelectric point of aggregates with only IgG was 7 to 9 and of only IgA 4.5 to 5.5. The isoelectric point of mixed aggregates decreased as the percent IgA increased. IgG aggregates mixed with normal human serum caused 30% C3 activation (20 min, 37 degrees C) whereas IgA aggregates causes no activation. There was a linear decrease in C3 activation as the percent IgA increased. Mixed aggregates that contained either radiolabeled IgG or IgA were mixed with normal human serum (1 h, 37 degrees C) and then solubilized, reduced, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Heavy m.w. bands, consistent with covalent bonding of C3b and C3bi to Ig H chain were only seen in lanes with labeled IgG. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis. A human dimeric IgA1 myeloma protein with rheumatoid factor activity was also studied. It caused 15% alternative pathway C3 activation but did not fix C3 to its H chain. Binding of aggregates (+/- C3) to E was tested. Aggregates with IgG C3 bound but IgA (+/- C3) did not. Addition of greater than 10% IgA to an IgG-C3 aggregate inhibited E binding. We conclude that IgG in mixed aggregates is the site of C3 fixation. In contrast, IgA does not fix C3 but instead lowers the isoelectric point, increases the size and inhibits binding to E. These properties would inhibit clearance and promote mesangial deposition and local C activation.\r"

Combining these sequences with published data has enabled the polymorphism in 40 HLA-A,B,C and 9 ChLA-A,B,C alleles to be analyzed. Diversity is generated through assortment of point mutations by recombinational mechanisms including gene and allelic conversions. The distribution and frequency of silent and replacement substitutions indicate that there has been positive selection for allelic diversity in the 5' part of the gene (exons 1 to 3) and for allelic homogenization and locus specificity in the 3' part of the gene (exons 4 to 8). These differences may correlate with the lengths of converted sequences in the two parts of the gene and frequency of the CpG dinucleotide. Locus-specific divergence of HLA-A,B, and C demonstrates that recombinational events involving alleles of a locus have been more important than conversion between loci. This contrasts with the predominance of gene conversion events in the evolution of mutants of the H-2Kb gene. However, a striking example of gene conversion involving HLA-B and C alleles of an oriental haplotype has been found. Comparison of human and chimpanzee alleles reveals extensive sharing of polymorphisms, confirming that diversification is a slow process, and that much of contemporary polymorphism originated in ancestral primate species before the emergence of Homo sapiens. There is less polymorphism at the HLA-A locus compared to HLA-B, with greater similarity also being seen between HLA-A and ChLA-A alleles than between HLA-B and ChLA-B alleles. Although greater diversity is seen in the 5' \"variable\" exons of HLA-B compared to HLA-A, there is increased heterogeneity in the 3' \"conserved\" exons of HLA-A compared to HLA-B.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently isolated a human phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAP) that shares antigenic and biochemical similarities with melittin, a well characterized bee venom phospholipase-stimulatory peptide. To explore the potential mechanisms of action of PLAP that extend beyond its effects on eicosanoid synthesis, we examined its effects on the release of human neutrophil lysosomal enzymes and superoxide, and on RBC hemolysis. These results were compared to the effects of melittin, which has been reported to induce enzyme release and hemolysis. We also examined the effects of PLAP on neutrophil aggregation and chemotaxis. PLAP induced neutrophils to release beta-glucuronidase and metalloproteinase enzyme activities as well as produce superoxide ion in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. Eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors did not abrogate these responses. PLAP induced release of arachidonic acid metabolites, but this response could be abrogated by eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors. PLAP also induced neutrophil aggregation and chemokinesis, but not chemotaxis. Concentrations of PLAP that induced these responses did not induce cellular toxicity as determined by light and electron microscopy, lactic dehydrogenase release, trypan blue dye exclusion, and RBC hemolysis. In contrast, prolonged incubation with higher concentrations of PLAP induced cell death that was similar to that observed with melittin. These findings suggest that the mechanisms of action of PLAP extend beyond the eicosanoid synthetic pathway, and that disordered regulation of PLAP may be responsible, at least in part, for chronic immune and inflammatory states.\r"

  ".U": "89235218\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation by monovalent cations, guanine nucleotides, and bacterial toxins of [3H]FMLP binding to rabbit neutrophil plasma membranes was studied by using dissociation techniques to identify regulatory effects on separate receptor states. Under conditions of low receptor occupancy (1 nM [3H]FMLP) and in both Na+ and K+ buffers, dissociation is heterogenous, displaying two distinct, statistically significant off rates. [3H]FMLP binding was enhanced by substituting other monovalent cations for Na+. In particular, enhanced binding in the presence of K+ relative to Na+ was caused by additional binding to both rapidly and slowly dissociating receptors. Three receptor dissociation rates, two of which appear to correspond to the two affinity states detected in equilibrium binding studies, were defined by specific GTP and pertussis toxin (PT) treatments. Neither GTP, nor PT or cholera toxins (CT) had an effect on the rate of dissociation of [3H]FMLP from the rapidly dissociating form of the receptor. Both 100 microM GTP and PT treatments increased the percentage of rapidly dissociating receptors, correspondingly decreasing the percentage of slowly dissociating receptors. The observed changes in the rapidly and slowly dissociating receptors after GTP, PT, and CT treatments were caused by an absolute decrease in the amount of binding to the slowly dissociating receptors. However, complete inhibition of slowly dissociating receptor binding by GTP, PT, or both was never observed. Both GTP and PT treatments, but not CT treatment, increased by two-fold the rate of dissociation of 1 nM [3H]FMLP from the slowly dissociating form of the receptor, resulting in a third dissociation rate. Thus, slowly dissociating receptors comprise two different receptor states, a G protein-associated guanine nucleotide and PT-sensitive state and a guanine nucleotide-insensitive state.\r"

Mice bearing IAk were strong responders to all three peptides. Mice bearing IAd were strong responders only to the 3' repeat peptides, the octamer and tetramer. Mice bearing Is or Iq did not respond to any repeat peptides. Remarkably, the pattern of genetic restriction of the antibody response to the entire RESA as expressed in vaccinia indicated that there were no other epitopes besides the three repeats. Because only one class II haplotype (i.e., k) out of five tested responded strongly to this peptide and only two out of five (i.e., k and d) responded to the octamer or tetramer, it may be difficult to achieve a good immune response against RESA in most or all humans.\r"

In contrast, H-2Ld mRNA was barely detectable in embryonic RNA until day 18 of pregnancy, although it was present in placental RNA samples on days 10 to 13 of gestation. Qa-region genes demonstrated a different pattern of expression than H-2Dd, -Kd, and -Ld. Transcripts of Q7, one of the genes encoding Qa-2 surface Ag, were detected in the developing embryo on days 9 to 11 post coitum but decreased thereafter. However, Q7d transcripts were not detected in placental tissues at any stage. Q6 mRNA was not detected in any of the tissues, and Q10 mRNA was detected only in day 12 to 13 embryos, where expression is known to be restricted to the fetal liver. Transcripts from T13, a Tla-region gene, and D2d, a D-region gene, were not detected in any of the samples tested.

Cell lines established from \"biologically early\" lesions of malignant melanoma were able to present the soluble Ag tetanus toxoid (TT) to autologous and HLA-DR-matched allogeneic, TT-immune T cell clones. Proliferation of T cell clones in response to Ag presented by primary melanoma peaked on day 2 of culture with Ag. Ag presentation was blocked by pretreatment of TT-pulsed and fixed melanoma cells with mAb against HLA-DR, but not HLA-DQ, HLA-DP, or HLA-ABC. Ag processing and presentation were inhibited by treating the melanoma cells with ammonium chloride. In parallel with previous findings from this laboratory demonstrating the inability of cell lines cultured from \"advanced\" primary or metastatic melanoma to induce autologous T cell proliferation, such cell lines also failed to present this exogenous Ag despite the presence of cell-surface HLA-class II molecules. Thus, in contrast to the finding in biologically early melanoma, none of the multiple TT-immune, T cell clones from autologous patients or HLA-DR matched donors was able to respond to TT presented by melanoma cells cultured from advanced disease. Co-incubation studies revealed that metastatic melanoma cells did not secrete inhibitory substances during the APC assay, however, they were able to process TT, rendering it \"immunogenic\" in the presence of fixed, autologous non-T cells. When fixed, autologous melanoma cells were assayed for their ability to present processed Ag; fixed cells of early but not advanced disease were able to present Ag in this setting, indicating that the presenting limb becomes flawed in the evolution of the metastatic phenotype. Finally, studies of chloroquine inhibition of the capacity of melanoma cells derived from early primary disease to stimulate autologous peripheral blood T cells suggest that such cells process and present tumor-associated Ag in the same fashion as the \"model\" Ag TT.\r"

We investigated the effect of repetitive treatments with angelicin (isopsoralen), a monofunctional psoralen, plus UVA radiation (IPUVA) on the number and morphology of dendritic epidermal cells (dEC). This effect was compared with that of 8-methoxypsoralen plus UVA radiation (PUVA), UVA alone, and UVB radiation. C3H/HeN mice were treated topically with the drugs three times/wk for 4 consecutive wk; followed each time by 1 or 2.5 J/cm2 of UVA radiation. Other groups of mice were treated with the drugs alone, UVA alone, or 0.81 J/cm2 of UVB. Epidermal sheets were stained for ATPase, Ia, and Thy-1 markers. Mice treated with PUVA and UVB exhibited severe phototoxicity, whereas no overt phototoxicity was observed in mice treated with IPUVA, UVA alone, or the drugs alone. Early during the PUVA and UVA treatments the ATPase marker was lost from dEC, followed by loss of the Ia marker; the Ia marker was lost before the ATPase marker from dEC in animals treated with IPUVA. At the end of the treatment, however, nearly total depletion of ATPase+, Ia+, and Thy-1+ dEC was observed in mice treated with PUVA and IPUVA. UVB radiation caused rapid depletion of Thy-1+ dEC as well as ATPase+ and Ia+ cells. During treatments with IPUVA, PUVA, UVA, and UVB, the Langerhans cells became rounded and lost their dendrites. These changes were quantitated by image analysis. We conclude that alterations of cutaneous immune cells can occur in the absence of overt phototoxicity, and that monofunctional and bifunctional psoralens plus low dose of UVA radiation may have different effects on dEC markers.\r"

Anthralin oxidation was investigated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy in a biological system and in a chemical system. Free radical formation in the skin of hairless mice is reduced by the antioxidant tocopherol. The data indicate that tocopherol acts by interfering with free radical formation rather than by scavenging persistent anthralin radicals directly. The skin radicals do not correspond to 10-anthranyl, the initial paramagnetic anthralin oxidation product. Similar radicals obtained in skin are formed by anthralin exposed to ultraviolet light or alkaline solution and by mitochondria and microsomes. The pertinent skin radical is attributed to products derived from anthralin dark structures, the final oxidation products of anthralin. It is suggested that resonance stabilized, paramagnetic polycyclic hydrocarbons are the compounds detected. Their stability and low reactivity indicate a low potential for cutaneous irritation and tumor promotion. Reactive oxygen species, which have been reported to be formed concomitantly during oxidation of anthralin, and the initially formed highly reactive 10-anthranyl radical are more potent candidates for mediating tumor promotion and inflammation.\r"

Addition of 10(-9)-10(-6) M 12(RS)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(RS)-HETE) neither stimulated keratinocyte proliferation nor enhanced the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. The ability of neonatal keratinocytes in low serum medium to respond to exogenous factors was demonstrated by increased growth in response to a mixture of cholera toxin, hydrocortisone, and epidermal growth factor. Confluent keratinocyte cultures in 10% human AB serum exposed to 12(S)-HETE for 72 h also showed no changes in DNA, [3H]thymidine incorporation, or labeling index. Metabolism of 12(S)-[3H]HETE was greater in cultures containing low concentrations of serum but there was no evidence for the formation of 12,20-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid.\r"

Using this technique we have studied, following epicutaneous application of a sensitizing dose of a hapten, 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB), the fate of the epidermal LC located in the sensitization zone. We wanted to know, under the light microscope, if the density and/or morphology of the LC are modified by such a treatment and, under the electron microscope, what are the ultrastructural changes accompanying the possible light microscope modifications. Under the light microscope, the observation of LC during the 5 d necessary for the development of contact sensitivity to DNFB shows that their number drops in the course of the first 24 h to normalize again 3 d later. Under the electron microscope, observations over the first 24 h revealed that LC remained in the epidermis, but were ATPase-negative. The disappearance of the membrane ATPase activity took place while the LC presented an increased number of coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, and lysosome organelles which characterize, at the ultrastructural level, the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). Following RME, many Birbeck granules (BG) appeared in the cytoplasm. Thus, epicutaneous application of DNFB leads to an endocytic activation of LC. However, the ligand(s) and/or the cell-surface components, which probably internalize during the RME process, remain unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The type I keratin 19 is unusual in its tissue distribution in that under normal circumstances it does not seem to be restricted, as the other keratins are, to expression in either stratified or simple epithelia. In addition to the previously reported distribution of keratin 19 in human tissues, we have observed keratin 19 in epidermal basal cells, in a defined region of the hair follicle, and in nipple epidermis. We noticed that expression of keratin 19 appears to be especially characteristic of regions of labile or variable cellular differentiation as indicated by the presence of multiple keratin phenotypes in close proximity to each other. Using a monoclonal antibody recognizing keratin 19 (LP2K) to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library, we have isolated, cloned, and sequenced cDNA coding for full-length human keratin 19, as confirmed by its reactivity with several other known anti-keratin 19 monoclonal antibodies and by the near identity of its sequence with that of the bovine keratin 19 homologue. This similarity extends to both proteins being truncated at the C-terminal end to only 13 amino acids beyond the rod domain. Although the amino acid homology over the N-terminal and helical rod domains is particularly high, the human and bovine proteins diverge substantially over the short C-terminal domain, which suggests that this region has no conserved function. Comparison with other type I keratins indicates that the closest evolutionary neighbors of keratin 19 are keratinocyte keratins, probably 13 and 14, and not the simple epithelial keratin 18. Assessing the histochemistry and sequence data together, we propose that the cell may use this apparently deficient keratin as a \"neutral\" keratin. While unimpaired in its ability to polymerize (keeping the cell integrated into the epithelial sheet via filament-desmosome networks), keratin 19 expression does not irrevocably commit a cell to any one of the local differentiation options. Such predicted differentiational flexibility may also imply vulnerability to transformation.\r"

Laser treatment has been applied to lesions with a range of pigment depths from superficial lentigines in the epidermis to the nevus of Ota in the reticular dermis. Widely divergent laser parameters of wavelength, pulse duration, energy density, and spotsizes have been used, but the laser parameters used to treat this range of lesions have been arbitrary, with little effort focused on defining optimal laser parameters for removal of each type. In this study, miniature black pig skin was exposed to five wavelengths (504, 590, 694, 720, and 750 nm) covering the absorption spectrum of melanin. At each wavelength, a range of energy densities was examined. Skin biopsies taken from laser-exposed sites were examined histologically in an attempt to establish whether optimal laser parameters exist for destroying pigment cells in skin. Of the five wavelengths examined, 504 nm produced the most pigment specific injury; this specificity being maintained even at the highest energy density of 7.0 J/cm2. Thus, for the destruction of melanin-containing cells in the epidermal compartment, 504 nm wavelength appears optimal.\r"

Most of the human involucrin molecule consists of a segment of homologous repeats of a sequence of 10 amino acids. A similar segment is present in the involucrin of other higher primates, but not in lower animals. We show here that the older part of the involucrin molecule (the ancestral segment) is present in the epidermal cells of subprimates. This has been demonstrated with antisera prepared against different peptides of the ancestral segment of the human protein. No single antiserum detects involucrin of all subprimate species, but probably all involucrins can be detected using antiserum against some sequence in the ancestral segment. Although the involucrin gene has been extensively remodeled in higher primates, its origins extend lower in the animal kingdom.\r"

ICAM-1 was not expressed on epidermal keratinocytes in noninflamed skin. Its expression was not related solely to epidermal hyperproliferation, as hyperproliferative, tape-stripped epidermis did not express ICAM-1. We have reported previously that ICAM-1 expression on epidermal keratinocytes was upregulated by treatment with interferon gamma and that activated T lymphocytes bound to cultured epidermal keratinocytes in vitro by lymphocyte function associated-1 (LFA-1) molecules on T cells and ICAM-1 on epidermal keratinocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that upregulation of expression of ICAM-1 is an important feature of cutaneous inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The maturational stage at which sebaceous epithelial cells are irreversibly committed to autolysis has not been determined in a biologic system. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the relationship of sebocyte maturation to their ability to grow in culture. Single cell suspensions from adult rat preputial glands were prepared, and sebocyte stages were classified using lipid staining as one criterion of maturation. Cells were subjected to one-step, isokinetic discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in Percoll. Cells were cultured on 3T3 feeder layers in an epithelial cell medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, growth factors, and antibiotics. Growth in culture occurred from sebocytes in all gradient fractions. The least growth was found from cells in the lightest density fraction (1.020), which contained sebocytes with the most lipid, i.e., the most mature. Over fivefold more growth occurred from cells in the most dense fraction (1.080), which contained undifferentiated and immature sebocytes. Cell growth in culture was then correlated with the type of sebocyte in each fraction plated. Although cell growth in culture correlated significantly with the number of undifferentiated cells (r2 = 0.460), epithelial colonies were found in the absence of discernible undifferentiated cells in most fractions. Growth in culture correlated much better with the number of early plus mid-differentiated sebocytes (r2 = 0.702). These data suggest that, whereas mature sebocytes are not capable of attachment/proliferation, early differentiation of sebocytes is compatible with retention of the capacity to proliferate. If this property is shared by human sebocytes, it would contribute to the intransigence and diversity of acne-form lesions.\r"

  ".W": "For growth at low seeding densities, keratinocytes isolated from human tissues like epidermis or hair follicles are dependent on mesenchyme-derived feeder cells such as the 3T3-cell employed so far. As an alternative method, the present study describes the use of post-mitotic human dermal fibroblasts sublethally irradiated or mitomycin C-treated. Special emphasis was put on efficient growth of primary keratinocyte cultures plated at very low seeding densities. Thus, outer root sheath cells isolated from two anagen human hair follicles and plated in a 35-mm culture dish (3 - 6 X 10(2) attached cells) grew to confluence within 3 weeks (6 - 8 X 10(5) cells). Similar results were obtained for interfollicular keratinocytes. A crucial point for the function of these fibroblast feeder cells is plating at appropriate densities, considering their tremendous increase in cell size at the post-mitotic state. Plating densities of 4 - 5 X 10(3/cm2 allow full spreading of the feeder cells and do not impede the settling and expansion of the keratinocytes. Major advantages of this system include easier handling and better reproducibility than using 3T3-cells. Moreover, homologous fibroblast feeders mimic more closely the physiologic situation and therefore might provide a valuable tool for studying interactions between human mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Finally, potential hazards of using transformed feeder cells from a different species in keratinocyte cultures raised for wound covering in humans could be thus avoided.\r"

Taking this for granted, a study was done to compare the effects of topical antiandrogenic treatment in vivo on the morphology and size of sebaceous glands with the concomitant changes in in vitro metabolism of 3H-testosterone. The role of dihydrotestosterone in sebaceous gland stimulation was thereby investigated. Topical treatment was carried out with the androgen antagonist 17 alpha-propylmesterolone (PM), with 4-androsten-3-one-17 beta-carboxylic acid (17 beta-C), and 17 beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one (4-MA), both described as specific 4-steroid-5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, and with progesterone (PRO), which is an androgen receptor antagonist with 5 alpha-reductase inhibiting properties. Regrowth of sebaceous glands after castration and substitution with testosterone propionate or dihydrotestosterone could be inhibited by topical PM and PRO. This occurred irrespective of the influence on testosterone metabolism and irrespective of the mode of substitution. 4-MA, on the other hand, while exhibiting strong 5 alpha-reductase inhibition in vitro, was ineffective in reducing sebaceous gland sizes in vivo. The compound 17 beta-C was ineffective in every respect. In no case were systemic antiandrogenic effects on prostates and seminal vesicles observed. Our results support the view that the DHT formation rate has no regulatory function for growth of sebaceous glands in hamsters and that PM and PRO counteract the androgenic stimulus by their competitive antagonistic binding to the androgen receptor, but not by their influence on testosterone metabolism.\r"

In the white population, the epidemiologic evidence indicates that exposure to sunlight may be an important causal factor of the disease.

In our survey, 241 out of 833 cases of melanoma (28.9%) in Japanese patients involved the skin of the soles. Whites tend to have a wide distribution of cutaneous melanoma over the whole body surface, showing the greatest aggregation of lesions on the head, neck, and trunk, with small number on the soles of the feet. This comparative study revealed that the anatomical distribution and clinical types of malignant melanoma in the United States and Japan were different.

Epidemiologic studies show a complex association with sun exposure. Risk is related positively to the levels of exposure typical of the place of residence, and also to personally controlled exposure, with the maximum risk being related to acute intermittent exposure. Risk also varies with pigmentation, family history of melanoma, and the presence of benign and of dysplastic nevi. The following methods of control of melanoma in such populations are discussed: the most effective methods depend on early diagnosis; primary prevention appears difficult and requires evaluation; identification of very high-risk subjects on the basis of family history and dysplastic nevi will affect only a very small proportion of melanomas; the use of simpler methods to identify high-risk subjects is explored. In Japan, melanoma is comparatively rare, but increasing as rapidly as elsewhere. The incidence rate of acral lentiginous melanoma appears similar to that in whites, comprising a large proportion of melanoma in Japan. Control programs cannot be designed rationally, since basic information on the occurrence, presentation, and survival of melanoma in Japan is lacking. Some specific research questions are suggested.\r"

In this paper, a similarity between benign and atypical acral nevomelanocytic proliferations in Japanese and whites is described.

However, when five-year survival for lesions on the hands and feet in the U.S. series is compared with the mainly acral melanomas in the Japanese series, the results show five-year survivals of 63% and 73%, respectively. Comparison of five-year survivals for clinical stage I acral lentigenous melanoma of the soles subdivided by thickness would establish whether data from the large series collected in the United States can be extrapolated to melanoma behavior in Japan.\r"

A total of 42% of 33 porokeratosis skin lesions in eight of the 16 patients showed DNA polyploidization in the epidermis. Most of the porokeratosis skin lesions, with or without DNA polyploidization, increased cell proportions in the S and G2/M phase range. These findings suggest that porokeratosis is undergoing the neoplastic process, and is the precursor skin manifestation of malignant tumors.\r"

When multiple cancers were scored separately depending on the histopathologic types, 12.1% of the skin cancers in XP patients was malignant malignant melanoma. The relative incidence of malignant melanoma in skin cancer in XP patients is similar to that in skin cancer in general (12.6%), reported previously. Most of the malignant melanoma in XP patients developed in skin exposed to sunlight, in contrast to the high incidence of malignant melanoma in general in the unexposed skin of Japanese people. A DNA repair defect of UV damage is strongly suggested to be responsible for the high incidence of skin cancer in XP patients. The onset of malignant melanoma in XP patients was about ten years old, and was as early as those of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the patients with very low DNA repair capacities. Among nine genetic complementation groups and a variant type, group A XP cells were found to be extremely hypermutable by ultraviolet light, while group C XP cells were also hypermutable, but at the same level as normal cells when adjusted for survival. Mutagenesis as a possible mechanism of carcinogenesis in XP is supported by these results, but evidence in other cancer-prone hereditary diseases is yet to be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "At the final step of melanocyte differentiation in mouse hair follicles, the cells produce melanin. The type of melanin they produce is, however, determined by the tissue environment of hair follicles. In wild-type mice, melanocytes located in hair bulbs synthesize eumelanin at the beginning of hair growth. They subsequently produce pheomelanin and finally produce eumelanin again. Therefore, the hair is characterized by a subterminal band of yellow, with the rest of it displaying black. This characteristic is called the agouti pattern and is known to be determined by the wild-type allele, A at the a (agouti) locus, which is considered to function in the follicular cells. Expression of the agouti pattern is altered by genetic substitutions at the a locus and the e (extension) locus. Animals heterozygous for the Ay (lethal yellow) allele exhibit yellow coat color; those homozygous for the e (recessive yellow) also produce yellow hair exclusively. By using an organ culture method, we demonstrated that alpha-MSH and cholera toxin, as well as forskolin, induced eumelanin synthesis in explants from lethal yellow mice (Ay/a). On the other hand, these reagents did not induce eumelanogenesis in the hair follicles of recessive yellow (e/e) mice. Therefore, we assume that the product of the a locus, which probably functions in follicle cells, interacts with alpha-MSH at the alpha-MSH receptor and that the e locus controls the functionality of adenylate cyclase in the membrane of mouse melanocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple differentiation shown by a single cell line (GEM 81) of goldfish erythrophoroma (tumors of integumental erythrophores) cells after administration of chemical induction in vitro includes 1) melanogenesis, 2) formation of reflecting platelets, 3) synthesis of pteridines heterogeneous to this species, 4) formation of dermal skeletons such as teeth and fin rays, 5) production of neuronal characters, and 6) genesis of lentoid bodies. Melanogenic cells, highest in inducibility, also show remarkable phenotypic diversification in their cell morphology, pigmentation, and physiologic response. In this paper, the following findings are presented; a) multiple differentiation shown by erythrophoroma cells occurs on a clonal basis, making whole component cells of a given induced colony strikingly similar in their cell characters, and b) induced melanogenic clones manifest a remarkable polymorphism in their melanosome ultrastructure and receptor composition associated with motile response. The divergence covers concentric lamellar, multivesicular, fibrillar, and macroglobular types for the former, and a varying combination of receptors for epinephrine, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), and melatonin for the latter. Because a spectrum of phenotypes expressed by differentiation-induced erythrophoroma cells is restricted to those of neural crest origin (except lentoid bodies) and polymorphism in induced melanized cells is composed mostly of a collection of a variety of known melanogenic characters, it is presumed that erythrophoroma cells are capable of multiple differentiation within the commitment as neural crest cells.\r"

The incidence of DMN is quite low in the Japanese. It is indicated that this fact may partly explain the low incidence of malignant melanoma in Japanese; in particular, low incidence in sun-exposed areas. The patients with DMN were largely males. They were different from ordinary Japanese in that they usually burn and tan poorly after sun exposure. In addition, the synthesis of melanosomes in the dysplastic melanocytes was found to be abnormal and characterized by a significant alteration in the fine structure of the melanosomal matrix and the pattern of melanization. These abnormal melanosomes reacted positively with MoAb HMSA-1 and HMSA-2, which identify the structural matrix protein of melanosomes unique to neoplastic melanocytes. Importantly, HMSA was present in both dysplastic melanocytes and melanoma cells, but not in epidermal melanocytes (nevus cells) of common melanocytic nevi.\r"

They appear to work in part through their properties as potent reducing agents, and thereby interfere with several redox reactions that are crucial to the synthesis of cellular DNA. Interestingly, the compounds can then be converted to their oxidized or quinone forms, which are powerful electrophiles, and further disrupt cellular metabolism. This latter mechanism appears to account for the relatively increased cytotoxicity observed in melanin-producing cells. In addition to providing potential new agents for the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma, these compounds might prove to be valuable tools in determining the factors that influence rates of DNA synthesis in normal and malignant cells.\r"

When layered on a plastic surface, ECM extracted from the rat lung, liver, or kidney enhances the attachment of C1300 murine neuroblastoma cells to that surface. Enhanced attachment to ECM by these cells correlates with their potential to form metastatic deposits in vivo. Conversely, neuroblastoma cells selected for increased metastatic potential by in vivo passaging demonstrate enhanced attachment to organ-derived ECM. However, although ECM provides attachment sites for these murine neuroblastoma cells, the attachment is not preferential for any of the organ ECMs tested (lung, liver, kidney). Histopathologic examination of the murine liver, lungs, and kidneys performed 20 to 22 days after intravenous inoculation of C1300 cells reveals notable metastatic seeding in each of these organs, but the liver clearly exhibits a greater degree of replacement by tumor metastases than the lungs or the kidneys. Therefore, the data from the attachment assays, coupled with the histopathologic findings obtained after tumor inoculation, suggest that although the ability to attach to ECM correlates with metastatic potential, additional factors are important in determining the preferential pattern of metastatic disease observed in murine neuroblastoma.\r"

In vitro activation of mast cells before macrophage activation caused a decrease in O2- -mediated cytochrome c reduction. This decrease was proportional to mast cell activation and reached 80% to 100% when mast cell mediator release was 40% to 50%. Incubation of isolated mast cell granules with macrophages before activation also inhibited O2- -mediated cytochrome c reduction in a dose-dependent manner. Mast cell granule-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c reduction was not caused by histamine, serotonin, or any other dialyzable components but was found to be caused by the scavenging of O2- by mast cell granule-bound superoxide dismutase. Macrophage uptake of sulfur 35-labeled mast cell granules, electron microscopic localization of mast cell granules in the macrophage phagosomes, and the abrogation of mast cell granule effect when the cells were preincubated at 0 degree C indicate that the effect was associated with the adherence or phagocytosis (or both) of mast cell granules. These results suggest that mast cell granules interact with macrophages and that granule superoxide dismutase scavenges O2- generated by the phagocytes.\r"

Although levels of total (ED1 + plus ED1 -) fibronectin were also elevated in plasma samples from patients with vasculitis, only the concentration of the ED1 + variant correlated with severity of disease in two patients examined serially. Elevations in plasma content of ED1 + fibronectin, but not total fibronectin, were also noted in patients with acute vascular tissue injury associated with major trauma or sepsis syndrome. Western blot examination revealed the presence of intact dimeric ED1 + fibronectin in the circulation of all patients studied, although fragments bearing the ED1 were also detected.

In the same samples, the level of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was increased (greater than 4 IU/L) in only 55.6% of the patients with prostate cancer and in 7.4% of the patients with BPH. According to these findings, the sensitivity of the test is 84.4% (55.6% for PAP) and the specificity is 92.9% (94.9% for PAP). The increase in PSA concentration in BPH correlates well with the prostate mass (gamma = 0.794), although there was no patient with a prostate weight higher than 30 gm and a PSA concentration lower than 5 ng/ml, and all patients with PSA concentrations lower than 4 ng/ml had prostate weight of less than 10 gm.\r"

SHRs and normal Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were killed at ages 6 and 20 weeks, and their aortas were removed. A portion of each aorta was used for determination of passive mechanical properties, and the remainder was incubated with carbon 14-labeled proline containing medium for 18 hours at 37 degrees C. After incubation, the tissues were lyophilized, and aliquots were used for sequential extraction with neutral salt, acetic acid, and pepsin at 4 degrees C. The pepsin extracts that contained most of the collagen were used for characterization of the collagen types and synthesis of collagen by the production of [14C]-labeled hydroxyproline. Collagen concentration decreased approximately 16% in both 6- and 20-week-old aortas, but collagen synthesis was about twofold higher in the aortas from both 6- and 20-week-old SHRs. Although type V collagen represented a minor fraction of total collagen (5%) in the aortas of WKY rats, it was twofold greater in the hypertensive animals. This increment in type V collagen in SHR aortas was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of type I collagen, with no change in the proportion of type III. Study of the passive mechanical properties of the tissues showed that SHR aortas were stiffer compared with aortas of WKY rats, with a larger difference at 20 weeks than at 6 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We designed studies to characterize metabolic aspects of the protective effects of glycine and glutathione against hypoxic proximal tubule cell injury b clarifying the relationship between protection and preservation of tubule cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glutathione levels. The tubule preparation was glutatione depleted as isolated although some recovery occurred during incubation at 37 degrees C, and this recovery was enhanced by treatment with glutatione precursors. Increasing the duration of hypoxia from 30 minutes to 60 minutes produced increasingly extensive lethal tubule cell injury that was almost completely prevented, even at the 60-minute duration, by inclusion of either 2 mmol/L glutathione or 2 mmol/L glycine in the tubule incubation medium. Cell ATP levels decreased to the same extent and at the same rate in protected and unprotected hypoxic tubules. Glycine- and glutathione-protected tubules maintained higher cell glutathione levels than unprotected tubules at all durations of hypoxia studied. However, completely eliminating this increment of glutathione with either the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, or the glutathione reductase inhibitor, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, did not prevent protection. The data indicate that the striking protection against hypoxic injury to the isolated tubules provided by treatment with glycine or glutathione is independent of preservation of tubule cell ATP and glutathione levels, to the extent that difference of these levels can be discriminated in intact cells with present methods.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize receptors for alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) on human cells, we studied the binding of radioiodinated recombinant DNA-derived human IFN-alpha to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal individuals and from patients with chronic type B hepatitis. At 1 degree C, binding reached equilibrium after 2 to 3 hours of incubation, and saturation of specific binding occurred at a concentration of approximately 4000 fmol/ml. Binding of labeled IFN-alpha was specific; it was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled IFN-alpha or IFN-beta but not by cholera toxin or IFN-gamma. Scatchard analysis of binding data yielded for normal PBMCs an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.54 +/- 0.49 x 10(-9) mol/L (mean +/- SD) and an apparent maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 7.35 +/- 1.22 x 10(-11) mol/L. Corresponding values for patients with chronic type B hepatitis who had not received treatment were similar, suggesting that such patients should respond normally to endogenous interferon. Analysis of data on the binding of labeled IFN-alpha to normal PBMCs from experiments in which a high specific activity ligand or subpopulations of PBMCs had been used revealed that receptors for IFN-alpha on PBMCs are heterogenous. In patients with chronic type B hepatitis who were receiving IFN-alpha therapy, the apparent Kd was increased (3.02 +/- 0.91 x 10(-9) mol/L) without any appreciable change in the apparent Bmax or any appreciable changes in the proportions of subpopulations of PBMCs. This decreased affinity induced by IFN-alpha treatment does not necessarily reflect an effect on a single binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of CaCl2 to bile increased total and free ionized calcium by from four to 12 times their original values and by from two to three times the highest concentrations encountered in bile in vivo. The increase in [Ca++] resulted in fourfold to 12-fold increases in the saturation indexes of bile, with the saturation index reaching as high as 73.4 in a common duct sample. Despite the markedly elevated CaCO3 saturation indexes, evidence of CaCO3 precipitation was not observed in either common duct or gallbladder bile over a 24-hour period. For comparison, calcium added to NaCl-NaHCO3 solutions resulted in the precipitation of CaCO3 within 4 hours if saturation indexes were greater than 12. These results indicate that native bile contains potent antinucleating factors that markedly inhibit CaCO3 precipitation, and they confirm our previous in vivo observations in canine common duct bile.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of vascular injury in Kawasaki disease (KD) is unclear. Recent studies suggest a role for circulating antibodies that are cytotoxic for endothelial cell antigens inducible by cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF, cachectin) is a monocyte- or macrophage-derived cytokine that has an important role as an effector molecule in various inflammatory processes. To study the possible involvement of TNF in KD, we measured the levels of circulating TNF in 39 patients with KD at various stages of the disease by using a newly developed sensitive radioimmunoassay. The TNF levels in sera from the acute and subacute phases of the disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in sera taken in the convalescence phase or in sera from children without inflammatory disease. In all patients from whom serial samples were available, the TNF level was higher during the acute and subacute phases than during convalescence. Coronary aneurysms developed in four of the patients, and these patients were among those who had the highest levels of circulating TNF during the acute and subacute phase (51.1 +/- 13.6 pg/ml (mean +/- SD) vs 30.4 +/- 15.8 pg/ml in patients without coronary aneurysms; p less than 0.001). No differences in circulating TNF levels were observed between patients who received as treatment aspirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin and those who received aspirin alone. The results show that the levels of circulating TNF are increased in acute KD and support the hypothesis that this cytokine may be involved in the pathogenesis of the vascular injury in KD.\r"

The epidermis was normal in nine, thickened in 16, with acanthotic thickening and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in 20. In the dermis the amount of collagen was normal, but it was infiltrated by the inflammatory process. Acute inflammation was observed in 16 biopsies, subacute in 23, chronic in six. A mixture of acute and chronic changes was present in 18 biopsies. No major abnormalities of the vasculature could be detected. The distinguishing pathological feature of M.E.O. concerns the typical topographic distribution of the inflammation in the osseous part of the external ear canal.\r"

The swabs were cultured on MacConkey's and Columbia blood agar plates. The rate of isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms decreased markedly following operation, while normal inhabitant organisms showed notable increase in their numbers post-operatively to reach a near normal level.

No matter how successful the surgical technique is in clearing disease from the sinus, it is still important that the fronto-nasal duct is kept patent unless the procedure is an obliterative one. Usually a tube is inserted for drainage and has to be kept in place for several weeks or months. This paper presents a study of 16 patients, suffering from frontal sinus disease, in whom a short-term drainage technique using a Foley catheter was employed between 1979 and 1988 at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. This type of drainage allows effective anchorage and irrigation with a decongestant. It has been found to give satisfactory results after 14 days in place and has had no unusual complications. It is therefore recommended for use in such cases.\r"

Eighty four patients developed Kaposi's sarcoma at some stage of their disease and the head and neck region was involved in 56 of them. Although Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely life threatening in AIDS, potential airway obstruction, pain or cosmetic disfigurement may justify treating the lesion. Whilst cutaneous tumours may be managed by using radiotherapy (16 Gray in four fractions over four days), this treatment produces a sever mucositis when used to treat mucosal disease; we, therefore use a combination of vincristine and bleomycin for this.\r"

Half of the treatments were given because of various malignant diseases. The results of the treatment of this very mixed group of patients were, as a whole, satisfactory with both CO2-laser and cutting loop. A more precise technique can be applied with the CO2-laser than the cutting loop, though the latter is the more efficient and easy to work with. Care must be taken with the loop because of its greater cutting depth. The argon laser has only limited use in the treatment of diseases in the trachea.\r"

Epistaxis is an unusual feature in these patients and when present is nearly always associated with a traumatic aneurysm (Mahmoud, 1979). There are only two reported cases of non-traumatic intracavernous carotid aneurysms presenting with epistaxis and diagnosed during the lifetime of the patient (Troupp, 1962; Labayle and Legent, 1964). The authors present a third such case. The importance of considering aneurysms in the differential diagnosis of epistaxis is emphasised. The radiological investigations and management of these patients is discussed.\r"

Consequently, it is important to have evidence of abscess formation before surgery is undertaken, as illustrated by this paper in the form of a case report and a review of the current literature.\r"

There is controversy about whether anemia should be regarded as a \"normal\" concomitant of the aging process. A survey of 232 Maryland physicians was conducted to examine how they approach this problem. The levels of both hemoglobin and hematocrit at which practicing physicians diagnose and perform an anemia workup on elderly patients were lower than currently recommended. Physicians who see more elderly patients used significantly lower values of hemoglobin and hematocrit for the diagnosis and workup of anemia. There were no significant differences between family physicians and internists in their approach to diagnosis or workup of anemia in the elderly.\r"

Families from the clinic roster, containing two adults and at least one child between the ages of 1 and 18 years, were asked to participate. Baseline (pre-influenza) data included a serum determination for influenza A and B antibodies, family functioning as measured by the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES) II and the Family APGAR, and parental stress as measured by the social readjustment rating scale (SRRS). During the study all family members of patients with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms or fever were seen, and throat swabs were obtained for viral culture. Approximately 2 weeks after the influenza epidemic ended (March 1984), sera for antibodies were again collected on all family members. Chi-square analysis showed that infection (defined as a fourfold titer rise or a positive viral throat culture) was significantly associated with both cohesion and adaptability as measured by FACES II. Neither the Family APGAR nor the SRRS was associated with influenza B infection. It was concluded that family functioning affects the frequency of influenza B infection within families. This finding raises the possibility that family dysfunction may lead to altered immune responses, which increases susceptibility to infection.\r"

Nearly two thirds of laboring women received paracervical anesthesia, three fourths of whom obtained noticeable pain relief. Partial relief was obtained by another 20%. Infants delivered after paracervical block were compared with those unexposed to this therapy and found to be similar in regard to Apgar scores and length of hospital stay. Fetal monitor tracings showed highly concerning alterations in 6% of patients after the block. It is concluded that paracervical block done by the technique described remains an effective and low-risk form of obstetric anesthesia in most obstetric patients in a community hospital.\r"

This article presents a framework for conducting such an interview, structured in three stages (contracting, exploration, and closure) with clinical examples for each stage. The single-session family interview provides the family physician with realistic guidelines for helping families who face medical dilemmas and for improving the physician's practice. The guidelines have proven useful in teaching residents the skills involved in understanding family dynamics and conducting productive family meetings.\r"

Their preference in most cases (92.5%) was to find another family physician. Examination of the physician-patient relationship revealed that most people felt there was a lag between the length of time it took the physician to understand their medical problems and the time it took to understand their emotional problems. Approximately one half (54.0%) of the respondents needed at least a few visits to become comfortable with a new physician. However, 8.6% needed years to gain that comfort. Eighty percent of those individuals who required years to become comfortable with a new physician were women. Further, the emotional attachment to the physician was greater in those families for whom the physician had delivered a baby.\r"

Rising malpractice insurance premiums and fear of lawsuit were factors most likely to influence a family physician's decision to cease obstetric practice. Lifestyle concerns and the number of obstetricians practicing in the area were also important factors for all family physicians. Important differences were found between family physicians who never delivered babies and those who had at some time practiced obstetrics. Family physicians who have given up obstetric practice were found to feel well trained and competent in this practice. Since changes in obstetric practice patterns have had an adverse effect on the obstetric care of women in rural areas and for the medically indigent, these findings have important public health implications.\r"

  ".W": "In a prior National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) adjuvant study, the addition of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to chemotherapy with melphalan and fluorouracil adversely affected survival in several patient subsets, suggesting an antagonistic drug interaction. To investigate this possibility, we studied the interaction of tamoxifen and other antiestrogens with several cytotoxic drugs in cultured human breast cancer cell lines. Clinically relevant concentrations of tamoxifen and melphalan reduced colony survival of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells when used alone in a colony-forming assay. However, pretreatment of cells with tamoxifen followed by exposure to melphalan resulted in antagonism, with more colonies surviving treatment with the combination than with melphalan alone. Identical effects were seen using several other triphenylethelene antiestrogens. An antagonistic interaction was observed even with a brief preincubation with tamoxifen that had no effect on cell proliferation, indicating that antagonism was not due to tamoxifen's known cell kinetic effects. Tamoxifen even antagonized melphalan cytotoxicity in ER-negative breast cancer cells and in cultured liver cells. An additive drug interaction occurred when melphalan was combined with pharmacologic concentrations of estradiol or medroxyprogesterone acetate, but antagonism was also observed with dexamethasone. Tamoxifen also antagonized the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil in these cells. However, an additive interaction occurred when the antiestrogen was combined with doxorubicin or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent that is transported into the cell by a different carrier-mediated mechanism than melphalan. To avoid potential antagonism in the clinic, combinations of tamoxifen with melphalan and/or fluorouracil should be avoided.\r"

  ".W": "The initial clinical and biological parameters, including clonogenic leukemic cell (CFU-L) assay, were reviewed for their prognostic significance in a cohort of 188 adult patients with newly diagnosed untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Almost all patients received induction therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) AML 5 to AML 9 trials. Bone marrow samples from 116 representative patients were obtained for CFU-L assay with an efficiency percentage of 89.6%; 76 patients had a measurement of the CFU-L self-renewal capacity (second plating efficiency [PE2]) and 91 patients had CFU-L inhibition test after exposure to DNR and/or Ara-C. The prognostic significance of parameters such as age, hematological antecedent, WBC count, liver enlargement, and Auer rods is confirmed in the present study. Moreover, high platelet and polymorphonuclear counts appeared to be related to resistance to induction course. However, through multivariate analysis, CFU-L sensitivity to drugs and self-renewal capacity appeared to be major independent prognostic factors in AML. A low CFU-L inhibition in the presence of the DNR and Ara-C combination correlates with a poorer complete remission (CR) rate, but not with CR duration. Patients with the lower PE2 values experienced both higher CR rate and longer CR duration. The practical interest of CFU-L study remains to be defined but, at least, PE2 measurement could be considered in the future as a major variable in determining therapeutic aggressiveness.\r"

  ".U": "89235697\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred seventy-seven children and young adults with various malignant neoplasms were prospectively tested for hearing loss after they had received cisplatin (n = 146), cranial irradiation (n = 18), or both (n = 13). Adequate renal function, no history of treatment with ototoxic drugs other than cisplatin, and availability for repeated audiometric testing were requirements for enrollment. Substantial hearing loss, defined as a hearing threshold of 50 dB or greater, was noted in only 11% of the cohort on tests conducted at the common speech frequencies (500 to 3,000 Hz). About half the patients had substantial deficits at higher frequencies (4,000 to 8,000 Hz). The probability of substantial hearing loss was directly related to the cumulative dose of cisplatin. In nonirradiated patients tested at the speech frequencies, there was a negligible risk of substantial deficits over the dose range of 90 to 360 mg/m2. As the dose increased to 720 mg/m2, the risk increased to 22%. In irradiated patients who later received cisplatin, cumulative drug doses as low as 270 mg/m2 were associated with a high probability of substantial hearing loss, suggesting potentiation of ototoxicity when these therapies are used together. Hearing acuity was either not affected or only minimally decreased in the irradiation-only group. Younger age, prior irradiation, and the presence of a CNS tumor each contributed significantly to the severity of hearing deficits at given cisplatin dose levels. We conclude that early increases in hearing threshold at a stimulus frequency of 4,000 Hz indicate probable subsequent deficits at lower frequencies, especially in young children with CNS tumors who have received cranial irradiation. The probability charts derived from this analysis should provide a useful tool for predicting hearing loss in the speech frequencies.\r"

  ".U": "89235698\r", 
  ".W": "Hydroxyurea and fluorouracil (5-FU) are active cytotoxic drugs in head and neck cancer and have shown synergistic activity in vitro. Both drugs also act as radiosensitizers. Therefore, we administered radiotherapy at daily fractions of 180 to 200 cGy with simultaneous continuous infusion 5-FU at 800 mg/m2/d and escalating daily doses of hydroxyurea for five days. Cycles were repeated every other week until completion of radiotherapy. Thirty-nine inoperable patients were treated at six dose levels of hydroxyurea ranging from 500 mg to 3,000 mg orally daily. Little effect of hydroxyurea on the WBC or platelet count was noted in patients receiving less than 2,000 mg daily, whereas both parameters decreased progressively in patients receiving 2,000 mg daily or more. Mucositis occurred at all dose levels, requiring frequent dose reduction of 5-FU; however, in patients receiving a daily hydroxyurea dose of 2,000 mg or less, the median weekly 5-FU dose administered was 1,725 mg/m2 (86% of the intended 5-FU dose), whereas at daily hydroxyurea doses exceeding 2,000 mg, the median weekly 5-FU dose decreased to 1,133 mg/m2 (57%) (P = .001). Of 15 evaluable patients with recurrent disease after prior local therapy only one failed to respond; six had a complete response (CR), and eight a partial response (PR). Of 17 evaluable patients without prior local therapy, 12 had a CR, with no patient developing recurrence in the irradiated field to date; five patients had a PR. We conclude that the recommended dose of hydroxyurea in this regimen is 2,000 mg daily. That dose will cause mild to moderate myelosuppression and will allow for delivery of greater than 80% of the intended 5-FU dose. The activity of this regimen in poor-prognosis head and neck cancer exceeds 90%; its further investigation in previously untreated patients is warranted.\r"

Clinical variables analyzed were age at onset, presence of systemic symptoms, prior or coexistent OI, development of OI greater than 3 months following KS diagnosis, and extent of disease. Laboratory variables analyzed were absolute number of peripheral T-helper lymphocytes (T4), helper/suppressor ratio (T4/T8), serum beta-2-microglobulin, and serum acid labile alfa interferon. Three independent variables were predictive of shorter survival: (1) prior or coexistent OI (P = .02), (2) presence of systemic symptoms (P = .001), and (3) absolute T4 count less than 300 cells/microL (P = .002). Based on survival, patients with AIDS-related KS can be divided into four groups: (1) those with no prior or coexistent OI, no systemic symptoms, T4 greater than or equal to 300 cells/microL (median survival, 31 months): (2) those with no prior or coexistent OI, no systemic symptoms, and T4 less than 300 cells/microL (median survival, 20 months); (3) those with no prior or coexistent OI and presence of systemic symptoms (median survival, 15 months); and (4) those with prior or coexistent OI (median survival, 7 months).\r"

  ".W": "A phase I study of mitoxantrone given as a continuous infusion for 21 days using a venous access port and a portable pump was performed. The first dose step was 0.3 mg/m2/d for 21 days. Courses were repeated every 6 weeks. Dose increment per step was 0.1 mg/m2/d in the first three dose steps and 0.2 mg/m2/d in the latter dose steps. Twenty-five patients entered the study and received a total of 50 courses, with a median of two courses (range, one to five). Up to 0.5 mg/m2/d, no toxicity (according to the World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) occurred. At 0.7 mg/m2/d, one patient experienced grade 2 leukocytopenia and at the 0.9 mg/m2/d dose step, one patient experienced grade 2 leukocytopenia, grade 1 thrombocytopenia, and grade 1 hair loss. At 1.1 mg/m2/d, two of six patients had grade 3 leukocytopenia, and in one patient treatment was discontinued after two days because of myocardial infarction. In both patients receiving 1.3 mg/m2/d, treatment was discontinued after 2 weeks because of grade 3 leukocytopenia. Three patients at the 1.1 mg/m2/d, dose step and two patients at the 1.3 mg/m2/d dose step experienced some nausea in the last week of the infusion period. One patient developed subclavian vein thrombosis. No infectious complications occurred. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection. Plasma steady-state was reached after 35 hours. During steady-state there was a linear relationship between the mitoxantrone dose administered and the level of mitoxantrone in plasma (r = .93, P less than .005). The mitoxantrone level in leukocytes increased significantly during the infusion period at the 0.9 mg/m2, the 1.1 mg/m2, and the 1.3 mg/m2 dose steps. The area under the curve (AUC) in leukocytes was higher with continuous infusion of 1.1 mg/m2/d for 21 days compared with bolus injection of 12 mg/m2. Mitoxantrone could be detected in plasma for at least five days after the end of the 21-day infusion period and in leukocytes for at least 14 days. Continuous infusion mitoxantrone may increase intracellular drug uptake as expressed by intracellular AUC. We recommend a dose of 1.1 mg/m2/d for 3 weeks for evaluation of antitumor efficacy in phase II studies.\r"

In an effort to guide this discussion, the authors review their experience with 17 cases of spinal dural AVM treated between January, 1984, and July, 1987. All patients presented with a slowly progressive paraparesis. The abnormalities were initially identified on myelography and confirmed by selective spinal angiography. Fourteen patients underwent endovascular embolization as a primary treatment, and a total of 18 embolization procedures were performed. After all but two of these, obliteration was confirmed at angiography. Patients' symptoms improved following 15 or these procedures but early improvement was not sustained in 10 instances; patients were unchanged after two procedures and worse after one. Follow-up angiography was performed at varying intervals after 15 of the 18 procedures, and recanalization of the previously obliterated spinal dural AVM was demonstrated in 13 instances. Eight patients ultimately underwent surgical treatment of their dura-based spinal AVM. No patient suffered deterioration of symptoms following operation. While embolization may allow angiographic obliteration of a spinal dural AVM and early clinical improvement, for the majority of patients these are not sustained. The average time to treatment failure was 5 months. Newer embolization materials will be necessary to effect permanent treatment in many of these patients.\r"

To test this hypothesis in cases of familial cerebral aneurysms, fibroblast cell cultures were established and the expression of collagen types I and III was studied in a patient with three cerebral aneurysms whose mother and sister also had cerebral aneurysms. Cultured skin fibroblasts were labeled with tritiated proline. The collagens and procollagens were precipitated and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction to analyze procollagen chains. Control cell lines were analyzed simultaneously. Quantitation of the ratios of type III to type I procollagen synthesis was achieved by integration of the intensities of the pro-alpha 1(III), pro-alpha 1(I), and pro-alpha 2(I) bands on fluorograms of electrophoretic gels of medium proteins. There was no difference in type I and III procollagen levels observed between the cells from the aneurysm patient and those from the control cell lines. These data do not support the hypothesis that familial cerebral aneurysms are caused by a deficiency of type III collagen.\r"

Angiography failed to demonstrate lesions in three cases, which did not appear to protect from repeat hemorrhage since two of the three rebled. There were no operative deaths, and no patients were made permanently worse after surgery. Useful recovery occurred commonly after appropriate treatment and appeared to be possible even in patients who had suffered a catastrophic neurological deficit at the time of presentation. These data indicate that surgical removal of the lesion may be warranted in some patients with symptomatic brain-stem vascular malformation.\r"

The extent of surgical tumor removal was gross total or radical subtotal in 33 patients (20%) and subtotal or biopsy only in the remaining 134 patients (80%). Postoperative radiation therapy was given to 139 (83%) of the 167 patients, with a median dose of 5000 cGy (range 600 to 6500 cGy). Multivariate analysis revealed that a pilocytic histology was the most significant prognostic variable associated with a good survival. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 85% and 79% for the 41 patients with pilocytic astrocytomas compared to 51% and 23% for the 126 patients with ordinary astrocytomas or mixed oligoastrocytomas. Postoperative irradiation did not appear to be associated with improved survival times in the patients with pilocytic astrocytomas; however, in the 126 patients with ordinary astrocytomas or mixed oligoastrocytomas, those who received \"high-dose\" radiation (greater than or equal to 5300 cGy) had significantly better survival times than those who received \"low-dose\" radiation (less than 5300 cGy) or surgery alone. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 68% and 39% for the 35 patients receiving high-dose radiation, 47% and 21% for the 67 receiving low-dose radiation, and 32% and 11% for the 19 treated with surgery alone. The survival rate was poor for the 23 patients with ordinary astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas who underwent gross total or radical subtotal tumor removal (14 of whom were also irradiated): 52% at 5 years and 21% at 10 years, with 19 of 23 patients developing tumor progression and dying 1 to 12 years postoperatively. In contrast, all 10 patients with pilocytic astrocytomas who had gross total or radical subtotal tumor removal alone were long-term survivors, with follow-up periods of about 4 to 25 years.\r"

In this experience, the most consistent finding is the subtle increased density of the disc compared with the dural sac. The diagnosis is aided by awareness that huge discs severely compressing the dural sac may be very subtle; the use of narrower windows for CT scanning, sagittal re-formation, and occasionally the use of myelography with or without repeat CT scanning may also assist.\r"

Bacteria were isolated in 13 cases and tuberculosis in three. Neurological abnormalities were present in over one-half of the patients, consisting of myelopathy (nine cases) or radiculopathy (four cases). Plain cervical spine films and polytomography demonstrated vertebral and end-plate destruction, spinal instability, and increased paravertebral soft-tissue shadow in all cases. Computerized tomography and, more recently, magnetic resonance imaging have proven helpful in detecting bone involvement and the presence of epidural extension associated with cervical osteomyelitis. The risk of vertebral body collapse, kyphosis, and myelopathy in the osteomyelitic cervical spine has standardized the management of this problem in this institution to consist of skeletal traction, needle aspiration or blood culture for organism identification, anterior cervical debridement, autogenous iliac graft fusion, and intravenous administration of antibiotics. Spinal stability and neurological improvement were achieved in all 18 patients.\r"

  ".W": "The indications for surgical fusion, as opposed to halo fixation, in the management of cervical spine injury are still unclear. At St. Louis University Medical Center a conservative protocol has been adopted to treat almost all cervical spine fractures with halo fixation. To determine what factors have contributed to failure of halo fixation, the records and radiographs of all patients with cervical spine injuries who were treated at that institution between 1984 and 1986 were reviewed. During this interval, 124 patients were treated, consisting of 93 men and 31 women between 6 and 94 years old. Of these, 15 (12%) had cervical fusion without preoperative halo device application. This group included eight patients with old injuries and delayed diagnosis, three with nonreducible locked facets, and four with miscellaneous indications. The remaining 109 patients were treated with halo vests. Four died before completing the 3-month standard treatment. Of those completing the treatment, 48 had C1-2 level injuries and 57 had C3-T1 level injuries. Sixteen patients (15%) failed their halo treatments and required surgical fusion: eight while still in halo fixation and eight after they had completed treatment with a halo device. Failure of halo treatment was indicated by recurrent dislocation in 13 patients and increased neurological deficit in three. Thirteen of the patients who failed treatment had C3-T1 injuries and three had C1-2 injuries. Of 27 patients with odontoid fractures, only two (7.4%) failed halo fixation. There were no failures in 11 patients with hangman's fractures. Of the 57 patients with C3-T1 injuries, 13 (23%) failed treatment, nine of whom had locked or \"perched\" facets. The factors causing failure of halo fixation were analyzed. The overall success rate was 85%, suggesting that the halo vest can be used to treat most patients with cervical spine injuries. Under certain circumstances (in the presence of old injuries, difficult reduction, or locked or \"perched\" facets), surgery may be indicated to avoid unnecessary delay in definitive management.\r"

  ".W": "A technique of posterior cervical interspinous compression wiring and fusion, which offers significant immediate stability, is presented. Its efficacy in 50 consecutive cases illustrates its utility. The technique involves the passage of an interspinous cerclage wire. Rather than placement of onlay laminar and facet grafts, a split-thickness tricortical iliac-crest graft is compressed against the involved medial laminae and spinous processes bilaterally. These grafts are held in place by a compression wire, which encircles the grafts and thus sandwiches the spinous processes between them. This virtually ensures subsequent bone fusion and offers substantial acute stability. The compression wire offers an added advantage of encircling the cerclage wire, thus pulling it dorsally. This significantly diminishes translational mobility at the unstable segment. It also minimizes hyperextension at the unstable segment via medial compression of the grafts into the interspinous space. The fusion of a minimal number of spinal segments is emphasized. This substantially diminishes the chance of flexible kyphosis and degenerative changes, both above and below the fusion site. A three- or four-level fusion was performed in only 11 patients. The remaining 39 patients underwent two-level fusion. A solid bone fusion was achieved in all cases, with a follow-up period of at least 6 months. In one patient, the spinous process fractured, necessitating an anterior fusion procedure. The technique presented here appears to acutely offer a very stable construct and, in addition, is a simple and straightforward procedure for the treatment of the unstable cervical spine.\r"

The tumors included four glioblastomas multiforme, one mixed glioma (astrocytoma grade I and ependymoma), one astrocytoma grade II, one cystic cerebellar astrocytoma, one ependymoma, one ganglioglioma, and one medulloblastoma. The relative amounts of polyadenylated (poly(A)+) RNA's homologous to these genes and their copy number were determined using the RNA and deoxyribonucleic acid blot hybridization techniques. The N-myc and v-sis probes hybridized strongly to the poly(A)+ RNA from the same recurrent glioblastoma with gene amplifications (N-myc 80 copies; v-sis three to four copies). The c-myc probe hybridized strongly to the recurrent medulloblastoma without gene amplification. The amplification or abundant accumulation of mRNA's homologous to their oncogenes may be involved in tumorigenesis or the aggressiveness of these malignant brain tumors of neuroectodermal origin and may be good molecular indicators of an extremely malignant state in these tumors.\r"

The rats were studied 10 to 20 days later when they became paraparetic. The regional blood-spinal cord transport constant (K, a function of the blood-spinal cord barrier) of 14Carbon-labeled aminoisobutyric acid was measured with quantitative autoradiography 6 hours after intravenous injection of low-dose (0.1 mg/kg), intermediate dose (1 mg/kg), and high-dose (10 mg/kg) dexamethasone. The effects of dexamethasone in these doses on the clinical signs and water content of the compressed cord were also evaluated 40 hours after treatment began. The K factor increased 730% in compressed compared with noncompressed spinal cords (p less than 0.001). Dexamethasone induced a dose-related reduction of both K (p = 0.007) and water content of the compressed cord (p less than 0.0001). Stabilization or, more rarely, improvement of weakness at 24 and 40 hours posttreatment correlated with the dose of dexamethasone (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that dexamethasone has a dose-related beneficial clinical effect associated with an improvement of blood-spinal cord barrier breakdown and a reduction of the water content of the compressed cord. This study supports the use of highdose dexamethasone for the initial treatment of epidural spinal cord compression.\r"

  ".W": "An increasing number of physiological and morphological studies indicate that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains via nonarachnoidal pathways in several mammalian species. Ultrastructural tracer studies were undertaken to examine the orbital route for CSF absorption in the rabbit. At the termination of the optic nerve subarachnoid space, an area of connective tissue containing numerous small tortuous channels is present. Ferritin (molecular weight 400,000) infused into the ventricles at normal and increased intraventricular pressure was present in these channels by 15 minutes postinfusion, and subsequently reached the intraorbital connective tissue. Elevating the intraventricular pressure did not noticeably alter the morphological appearance of this region or change the gross distribution pattern of the ferritin. Ferritin did not penetrate the scleral barrier to reach the choriocapillaris, nor did it breach the arachnoid barrier layer proximal to the transitional zone at the optic subarachnoid space to reach the dura mater. These results are very similar to those described for the hamster orbital region and the rabbit cribriform region. These experiments support the concept that macromolecules exit the subarachnoid space at the termination of the optic nerve via open channels, and that no significant barrier to drainage of macromolecules in CSF is present at this location.\r"

Forty-one rats in neurogenic shock (defined as a mean systemic arterial pressure (SAP) of less than 60 mm Hg) were subjected to various treatments to increase the mean SAP to a level of more than 80 mm Hg. The control group with neurogenic shock received no treatment, and the six treatment groups received infusions of: whole blood, packed cells, plasma, normal saline, dopamine, or a combination of dopamine and saline. Detrimental effects were observed after transfusion of packed cells or whole blood, which caused further deterioration of mean SAP. Although dopamine or the combination of dopamine and saline were both effective (p = 0.0001) for reversing hypotension, the combination was the most effective. If this rat paradigm correlates with human disease, these results indicate that, in the absence of hypovolemia, neurogenic shock due to acute intracranial hypertension should be treated with a combined transfusion of dopamine and normal saline, but not blood since the latter could have a detrimental effect.\r"

The angiogenic activity of 278 plaque fragments was tested; the fragments were taken from 12 patients with cerebral ischemia who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Angiogenesis, determined by the sustained ingrowth of new vessels in the rabbit cornea, was induced in 125 (45%) of these fragments. By contrast, angiogenesis was found in only two (2.4%) of 80 control tissues (p less than 0.001): in none of 22 samples of boiled atherosclerotic plaque; in two of 26 samples of normal rabbit carotid artery; and in none of 32 samples of nonatherosclerotic human uterine artery. Histological evaluation revealed that the cellular zones (composed mainly of smooth-muscle cells) were highly angiogenic, with 97 (76%) of 127 samples showing angiogenesis compared with 23 (17%) of 132 acellular fragments that consisted of amorphic, necrotic, calcific, lipid-laden material (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that angiogenesis in vivo is a function of the cellular component of the advanced atherosclerotic plaque, and is not expressed in the normal, stable arterial wall. The fragile new vessels could promote the growth of the plaque or be a source of hemorrhages, microinfarcts, and plaque fissures that convert a stable, silent lesion to an expanding, ulcerated, thrombotic, symptomatic plaque.\r"

The fixed distances between the recording leads enable quick calculation of conduction velocities of different nerve segments. Construction of the electrode is simple, and it can be designed to suit individual needs. The cost is marginal, reflecting primarily the costs of the original subdermal needle electrodes. The device is both safe and disposable.\r"

In two of the 12 cases, no ductal activity appeared and the diagnosis of choledochal cyst could not be made, although in one of these two cases delayed images were not obtained. Other frequent findings included delayed or nonvisualization of the gallbladder (11 of 12) and the appearance of prominent intrahepatic ducts (five of 12).

The 2-hr uptake of [99mTc]glucoheptonate and [111In]lysozyme proved of no value in this differentiation. The late renal retention of [99mTc]dimercaptosuccinic acid well separated the cisplatin from control rats, but the greatest difference was observed by the 2-hr uptakes of [131I]hippuran and DTPA.\r"

Its mechanism of action is unclear and previous reports have not demonstrated any significant consistent alteration in gastric emptying (GE) as measured by radionuclide techniques. Other proposed mechanisms include: placebo, hormonal, mechanical \"satiety\", behavioral modification, and neuronal. In order to determine the effect of the GEGB on GE, ten obese (mean % overweight = 89%) patients, 27-50 yr old (mean = 36 yr), had solid GE scans before and 5 wk after endoscopic placement of the bubble. GE scans were performed in six patients after removal (12 = wk residence time). The meal consisted of 300 microCi [99mTc]sulfur colloid in the form of a 300 kcal egg sandwich (egg white 248 g, white bread 40 g, butter 6 g; composition = CHO 40:PR 40: FAT 20) with 180 ml deionized water. Images were obtained in the anterior and posterior projections at 15-min intervals for 1 hr (four patients) or 2 hr (six patients) and the %GE (decay corrected geometric mean) was calculated. Unlike other studies involving the GEGB, adjunctive therapy in the form of dieting and behavior modification were not employed in this study. The effect of the GEGB alone in the treatment of obesity has not been previously evaluated. There was a significant (p less than 0.025) delay in gastric emptying at 1 hr (pre-bubble mean % gastric retention = 46%; bubble mean = 57%; n = 10). After removal, GE returned toward baseline (mean % gastric retention = 51%; n = 6) (p less than 0.05) (Student's t-test). The average weight loss was 5.5 lb (n = 10; p less than 0.025). One mechanism of action of the GEGB may be delayed gastric emptying resulting in early satiety and decreased food intake with resultant weight loss.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the susceptibility to sepsis in newborn infants deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), we screened 33,943 Saudi Arab infants. Deficiency of G6PD was found in 18%. Sepsis was determined by the presence of clinical signs of sepsis and confirmed by positive blood cultures. Sepsis was documented in 75 infants (2.2/1000). The incidence of sepsis was significantly higher in 6138 G6PD-deficient infants (3.4/1000) than in the 27,805 with normal G6PD activity (1.9/1000; p less than 0.02). The incidence of catalase-positive organism sepsis was higher in G6PD-deficient infants (2.9/1000) compared with those with normal G6PD activity (1/1000; p less than 0.0002), whereas the incidence of catalase-negative organism sepsis did not differ (p less than 0.2). Deficiency of G6PD was more common in infants with late sepsis (46%) than in those with early sepsis (21%) and in all infants screened (18%) (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that neonates with G6PD deficiency are more susceptible to late sepsis and to infection with catalase-positive organisms. The exact mechanism for the increased susceptibility is not clear, but a partial explanation could be lack of leukocyte bactericidal activity associated with G6PD deficiency, and an increased susceptibility to infection caused by hyperferremia resulting from lysis of G6PD-deficient erythrocytes.\r"

The prospectively identified clinical categories of encephalopathy for the neonates were 56 mild (hyperalertness, hyperexcitability), 84 moderate (lethargy, hypotonia, suppressed primitive reflexes), and 5 severe (stupor, flaccidity, absent primitive reflexes). The mortality rate to 8 years of age was 13%. The incidence of impairment, which included cerebral palsy, blindness, cognitive delay, convulsive disorder, and severe hearing loss, was 16% among those assessed at 8 years (75% of survivors). Intellectual, visual-motor integration, and receptive vocabulary scores, as well as reading, spelling, and arithmetic grade levels for those with moderate or severe encephalopathy, were significantly below (p less than 0.01) those in the mild encephalopathy or peer comparison groups. Predictors of reading performance for the study group included category of encephalopathy, birth weight for gestational age, native language, and mother's educational level (multiple R = 0.58). Nonimpaired survivors of moderate encephalopathy were more likely to be more than one grade level delayed than were children from the peer group (reading 35% vs 15%, spelling 18% vs 8%, arithmetic 20% vs 12%, p less than 0.01). Thus children who had moderate and severe neonatal encephalopathy are at risk for physical and mental impairment and reduced school performance. Children with mild encephalopathy had school performance scores similar to those of their peers.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the relationships of clinical symptoms and serum antibody levels during follow-up of 47 patients, aged 3 to 66 months, who were shown by formal milk challenge to have cow milk allergy. Three groups of patients were identified. Group 1 patients (n = 15) were sensitized to IgE and responded rapidly to small volumes of milk with urticaria, an exacerbation of eczema, wheeze, or vomiting. In the second group (n = 24), symptoms of milk enteropathy (vomiting and diarrhea) developed between 1 and 20 hours after milk ingestion. In the group 3 patients (n = 8), coughing, diarrhea, eczematoid rashes, or a combination of these developed more than 20 hours after normal volumes of milk were given. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE and of milk-specific anti-cow milk antibodies of these isotypes were measured initially and then at a median follow-up time of 16 months (range 6 to 39 months). In this investigation, changes in these immunologic measures during the study period were related to whether or not clinical tolerance to cow milk was achieved. At follow-up, six patients from group 1, ten from group 2, and two from group 3 were milk tolerant. No consistent change in any of the immunologic measurements was associated with remission of the disease. These findings raise the question of whether acquisition of clinical tolerance to cow milk in cow milk allergy can be attributed solely to immunologic events.\r"

  ".W": "We set out to determine if the clinical course or genetic profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis who had meconium ileus differed from those of other patients with cystic fibrosis. Since 1950 we have followed 158 patients with meconium ileus among 1175 patients with cystic fibrosis (13.4%). Patients with meconium ileus had lower birth weight (3026 +/- 610 gm) than patients with no meconium ileus (3169 +/- 534 gm; p less than 0.008); the deficit was especially evident in female patients. Survival in the first year of life increased from 55% in those born between 1958 and 1972 to 96% in those born between 1973 and 1987. Since 1973 the median survival of male and female patients with meconium ileus was similar to that in female patients with no meconium ileus (21 years), whereas 78% of males with no meconium ileus survived to this age (p less than 0.0001). Patients with meconium ileus born before 1972 had lower weight and height percentiles at age 13 years compared with patients with no meconium ileus, but this difference was not as apparent in patients born after 1973. There were no differences between the two groups in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or forced expiratory flow in the middle half of forced vital capacity. Patients with meconium ileus acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a younger age than did patients with no meconium ileus (4.20 +/- 4.67 vs 7.18 +/- 5.19 years), but there was no difference in age of acquisition of P. cepacia. In families in which the first child had meconium ileus, 29% of subsequent siblings with cystic fibrosis had meconium ileus, compared with 6% of siblings born to families in which the first child did not have meconium ileus. Allelic frequencies and haplotypic variants for cystic fibrosis chromosomes with respect to DNA markers closely linked to the cystic fibrosis locus were similar in families with cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus and those with no meconium ileus. These findings suggest that patients with cystic fibrosis and those without meconium ileus do not have major intrinsic differences and that the previously poor outlook in patients with meconium ileus has improved greatly.\r"

Sixty-four percent (276) lived in households with smokers or had contact with nonhousehold smokers. During the week before data collection, two thirds (184) of these 276 infants reportedly had tobacco smoke produced in their presence. Seventy-five percent of smoking mothers smoked near their infants. The amount smoked by the mother near the infant correlated with the amount smoked near the infant by nonmaternal smokers. Cotinine, an indicator of smoke absorption, was found in the urine of 60% (258) of all study infants. The amount smoked in the infant's presence, as well as the amount smoked farther away from the infant, especially by the mother, were the most significant correlates of the urine cotinine concentration. The results of this study suggest that efforts to reduce passive smoking in young infants should emphasize the importance of the mother's smoking behavior, smoke produced anywhere in the home, and household social influences on smoking behavior near the infant.\r"

During these periods, there were no changes in the proportion of infants delivered at the tertiary care center or community hospitals (171/84 vs 194/72); use of the tertiary care center increased only slightly, from 84% to 91%; and changes in neonatal management were mainly in improvements in diagnostic and monitoring techniques. When infants were grouped according to birth weights in 100 gm increments, survival improved significantly only for infants weighing between 501 and 600 gm at birth (2% vs 20% p less than 0.001). There were no differences in the overall survival rates to hospital discharge (46% vs 48%). The prevalence of neurosensory impairments was 24% in period 1 and 17% in period 2. There was a significant improvement in the proportion of infants considered to have disabilities by a functional classification assigned at 3 years corrected age (50% vs 27%, p less than 0.001), but only for infants weighing more than 800 gm at birth (49% vs 22%, p less than 0.001). Infants delivered at the community hospitals had a higher prevalence of neurosensory impairments compared with infants delivered at the tertiary care center (period 1, 35% vs 21%, not significant; period 2, 37% vs 14%, p less than 0.05). These data are encouraging; further efforts should be directed toward assessing which, if any, components of perinatal care are contributing to the improvement in morbidity rates.\r"

The subjects were studied prospectively from 36 weeks to 4 years of age, as available for follow-up. To classify them according to their neonatal status, we applied a principal components analysis to a number of variables representative of the extent of illness and of patient care in early postnatal life. The subjects were then divided into neonatal status quartiles and evaluated for hearing outcome. All those with sensorineural hearing loss fell exclusively into the lowest neonatal status quartile. Sensorineural hearing loss was statistically associated (1) with greater amounts of furosemide administration for longer durations and in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics and (2) with more episodes of low pH, hypoxemia, or both, higher total bilirubin levels, and substantially lower neonatal status scores. Birth weight, gestational age, highest creatinine level, Apgar score, and aminoglycosides alone were not systematically related to hearing capacity. Subjects in the lowest neonatal status quartile also had a considerably higher incidence of middle ear disorders, characterized by elevated thresholds and prolonged auditory brain stem-response latencies reflective of conductive hearing loss. We conclude that protracted illness and its associated treatment, independently of specific diagnostic categories, constitute important risk factors for permanent hearing loss and for transient hearing loss in early life.\r"

Ultrasound examination suggested resolution of the thrombus in all survivors in 6 to 30 days. Sequelae from thrombus formation were present in all patients at the time of discharge and included hypertension in 9 of the 11 survivors and decreased renal function in six of them.

Baseline (less than 72 hours postnatal) selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity were significantly lower in low birth weight infants than in full-term babies. Sequential selenium analyses were obtained in 16 sick low birth weight neonates who remained in the intensive care nursery for up to 6 weeks because of lung disease. All were fed parenterally without supplemental selenium, with or without oral intake, for periods varying from 3 to 60 days. All had a marked decrease from baseline selenium levels, and values below the detection limit of our assay were found in seven infants. Selenium deficiency is much more common in small infants than is generally realized, but the clinical significance in neonates is poorly understood.\r"

Increased intracranial pressure of greater than 200 mm H2O was observed in 42 patients. Three patients required ventriculostomy, and one of them needed ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Three patients died within the first week of admission, and four patients were lost to follow-up. Forty-four patients were followed for 1 1/2 to 7 years; 31 of them recovered completely. Thirteen patients recovered with neurologic sequelae, which included mental retardation, motor weakness, seizures, and hydrocephalus. No serious side effect of the drugs were observed except for transient elevation of liver enzyme activities in four patients. The combination of isoniazid and rifampicin for 1 year, with appropriate management of increased intracranial pressure, seemed to be safe and effective enough to be used as a routine treatment of tuberculous meningitis in areas where resistance to these drugs is uncommon.\r"

  ".W": "Zidovudine pharmacokinetics were determined in 16 children with human immunodeficiency virus infection who were being treated intravenously and orally on an intermittent schedule (every 6 hours). The intravenous doses studied were 80 (n = 3), 120 (n = 4), and 160 (n = 5) mg/m2/dose, infused over 1 hour. Fourteen patients were monitored after an oral dose of zidovudine at 120 (n = 2), 180 (n = 7), or 240 (n = 5) mg/m2/dose. Zidovudine was assayed with a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography method. Zidovudine disappearance after intravenous administration was rapid and biexponential, with half-lives of 14 and 90 minutes and a total clearance of 641 +/- 161 ml/min/m2. The volume of distribution at steady state was 45 +/- 28 L/m2. These pharmacokinetics parameters are very similar to those reported in adults. When administered orally, zidovudine was rapidly absorbed. The fraction of the oral dose that was bioavailable was 0.68 +/- 0.25, so that a 50% increment in the dose, in the conversion from intravenous to oral administration, resulted in plasma zidovudine concentrations after oral dosing that were nearly identical to those achieved with the 1-hour intravenous infusion. However, a dose of 180 mg/m2 given orally every 6 hours maintained plasma zidovudine concentrations in the target range of 1 mumol/L for less than half of the dosing interval. Other schedules, routes of administration, or oral drug formulations may have to be considered if sustained continuous exposure to micromolar zidovudine concentrations is desired.\r"

The interassay reproducibility was evaluated by testing a positive serum sample first with different sperm samples from the same donor and second with sperm samples from different donors. The results of those experiments showed that the indirect IBA has very low intraassay variation and greater interassay variability.\r"

When 0.2 mL of 1,000 U/mL heparin was added to 0.8 mL of blood, significant decline in the PCO2, base excess and bicarbonate concentration occurred. When 0.2 mL of 10,000 U/mL heparin was added to 0.8 mL of blood, a significant decline in the pH, PCO2, bicarbonate concentration and base excess was noted. Increasing the dilution and/or quantity of heparin in an umbilical arterial blood specimen may result in a significant misinterpretation of the fetal acid-base status by indicating a more significant chronic metabolic acidosis component than really exists.\r"

Continuous wave Doppler velocimetry was used to identify the umbilical and uterine artery velocity waveforms. A systolic:end diastolic ratio (S:D ratio) was calculated to analyze the obtained velocity waveforms. We treated 33 tightly controlled and monitored diabetic gravidas. The mean blood sugar value for this population was 95 +/- 8 mg/dL, and the mean umbilical artery S:D ratio was 2.5 +/- 0.3. That group of patients was compared to a group on which we reported previously. Statistically significant differences were found between the well-controlled and poorly controlled populations in third-trimester S:D ratios, number of stillbirths and neonatal morbidity. Uterine artery velocimetry allowed the identification of a patient who developed preeclampsia. This study seems to have indicated that umbilical and uterine artery velocimetry may have an adjunctive role in the surveillance of pregnancies complicated by diabetes.\r"

A strain gauge was used to measure the force used with a reusable, pyramid-tipped trocar system sharpened at regular intervals and a disposable trocar system also with a pyramidal point and of equal diameter (10 mm). Variables studied for both groups, 50 patients each, included the type of incision made at the umbilicus; the opening and closing laparoscopic gas source pressure; the volume of gas delivered to create the pneumoperitoneum; the age, weight and height of the patient; and whether the laparoscopy was the first or a repeat. The variables were matched for both groups. The disposable device required half the force for entry required with the reusable device. Since many gynecologists are now women and thus may have less upper body strength than men do, this finding could be important for them. Further, the disposable trocar affords an operator of any size and strength greater control over the potentially dangerous trocar insertion into the abdomen since less force is required.\r"

We evaluated the obstetric and perinatal outcomes in 112 consecutive patients with one or more hospital visits for false labor and compared them with those in matched controls. The only statistically significant difference was the incidence of oxytocin induction following premature rupture of the membranes in the false-labor group (16 vs. 6, chi 2 = 5.05, P less than .05). This study suggests that a previous false-labor admission does not increase the risk of a labor abnormality or suboptimum perinatal outcome.\r"

Thromboelastogram (TEG) measurements have been proposed as a standardized assay to predict such a predisposition. We therefore correlated LA and TEG assessments in 46 women who were either apparently healthy controls or who had abnormal LA levels with such conditions as endometriosis and repeated pregnancy wastage. The coefficient of correlation (Rho) was .3282 (P = .025). Seven patients with an abnormal LA demonstrated a normal TEG, and eight with a normal LA exhibited an abnormal TEG. Only nine had concomitant LA and TEG abnormalities. We conclude that LA and TEG apparently are not interchangeable as predictors of a hypercoagulable state. While this study did not address which of the two assays has a better predictive value for thromboembolic phenomena, it suggested that each can identify a different patient population.\r"

On the average the levels of IgG were relatively high after menstruation, declined during the ovulatory phase and remained relatively low during most of the luteal phase. The IgA levels were less than 10 mg/dL, and many samples contained IgA at our assay's lower limits of detection (microradial immunodiffusion). The preovulatory and luteal phase levels of IgG and IgA in vaginal fluid were generally lower than those reported for cervical mucus, but the ovulatory phase IgG and IgA composition was comparable between vaginal fluid and cervical mucus.\r"

Some months later she presented with headache, jaw claudication, weight loss, and chest pain. Anemia of chronic disease, cholestasis, steatorrhea, and pericardial effusion were noted. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) was diagnosed on temporal artery biopsy and prednisone was begun. Her symptoms rapidly abated but steatorrhea continued. It is suggested that these problems were related to GCA. Physicians need to be alert to the diverse presentations of GCA.\r"

The 4 mutually exclusive states used were (1) normal (creatinine less than 1.2 mg/dl and protein less than 2+ on dipstick); (2) proteinuria alone (creatinine less than 1.2 mg/dl and protein greater than or equal to 2+ on dipstick); (3) moderate filtration dysfunction (creatinine greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/dl and less than 4.0 mg/dl); and (4) severe azotemia (creatinine greater than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl). Duration in each state and subsequent transitions were incorporated in an assessment of outcome. Prognostic variables were found which predicted different outcomes within each of the 4 states. This stratification, based on renal function over time, provides a useful analytical tool for comparing subsets of patients with lupus. We found that serum complement (C3) predicted progression in state 1 and 2 as well as potential responders to therapy in state 3. No improvement was noted for patients in state 4.\r"

By EM, synovial cell proliferation and hypertrophy with collagen deposition was seen before the appearance of intracellular and extracellular hydroxyapatite crystals. These pathologic changes are the same as those found in the human spondyloarthropathies. Our EM findings demonstrate that hydroxyapatite crystals appear in the joints of ank/ank mice after the initial inflammatory phase.\r"

Our study shows that exposure to H2O2 also inhibits other chondrocyte functions, including total protein and DNA synthesis. Since these intracellular biosynthetic processes require adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the effect of exposure of H2O2 on chondrocyte ATP was measured. Exposure to H2O2 caused an immediate (less than 2 min) dose dependent decrease in cartilage ATP levels--found to be due to the oxidative inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3-PDH). We suggest that intrachondrocyte oxidant damage occurs through oxidation of the sensitive thiol (-SH) residue at the active center of G-3-PDH, with subsequent reduction in the rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis and the intracellular concentration of ATP which is required for DNA, protein, proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid synthesis.\r"

It could be shown to partially modify the chromatographic profile of newly synthesized osteoarthritic synovial tissue protein fractions containing suppressant activity.

Electron microscope studies demonstrated lamellar bodies (surface active DPPC) on the articular surface and in SF and lamellated phospholipid in light scrapings of joint surfaces. These were consistent with the quantity of phospholipid recovered by solvent rinsing. Friction measurements in vitro demonstrated excellent boundary lubrication imparted by multimolecular layers of DPPC under high load with coefficients of kinetic friction reaching physiological ranges (0.002-0.005).\r"

  ".W": "Between October 1985 and March 1987, 92 patients were registered on a phase II study of the Northern California Oncology Group investigating the importance of dose intensity in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment consisted of high-dose cisplatin in hypertonic saline (200 mg/m2 on a 28-day cycle) given in a divided day 1 and day 8 schedule. The response rate among 76 assessable patients was 36% (27/76), with complete response (CR) in 8% (6/76) and partial response (PR) in 28% (21/76). If all patients receiving any drug therapy were considered, the overall response rate was 31% (27/87), with CR in 7% (6/87) and PR in 24% (21/87). Median survival times for all assessable patients and all patients receiving any therapy were 37 and 35 weeks, respectively. With the use of a protocol design specifying dose delays rather than dose reduction for toxicity, the mean dose intensity delivered was 47.2 mg/m2 per week, or 94% of projected. Compared with other dose-intensive regimens of cisplatin, this day 1 and day 8 schedule was relatively well tolerated, with peripheral neuropathy as the dose-limiting toxicity. The data on response and median survival times among patients receiving this single-agent therapy are encouraging. They support the potential importance of cisplatin dose intensity in the treatment of NSCLC. Whether these results represent a positive dose-response effect in NSCLC will be tested in a randomized comparative trial of high-dose versus standard-dose cisplatin therapy.\r"

The level of cell kill achieved in CHRC5 cells by combinations of L-histidinol and either daunorubicin or CH approached that achieved in AUXB1 parent cells by these two drugs, whereas L-histidinol-VS combinations killed even more CHRC5 cells than VS in the parental line. The capacity of L-histidinol to reverse the MDR phenotype of the CHRC5 line was time and dose dependent and was eliminated by the addition of a twofold molar excess of L-histidine. The reversal of the MDR trait by L-histidinol appears to be independent of the drug uptake mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer incidence among 8,004 patients hospitalized for epilepsy between 1933 and 1962 in the Filadelfia treatment community in Denmark was compared to that of the general population. Patients received powerful and prolonged treatment with phenobarbital, phenytoin, and other anticonvulsants. This new survey extends the follow-up from 1976 through 1984. Among 7,864 patients with epilepsy not known to have received radioactive Thorotrast, record linkage with national cancer incidence files identified 789 cancers, compared to 664 expected [relative risk (RR) = 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.27]. Significant risks were found for cancers of the brain and central nervous system (RR = 5.7; n = 118) and the lung (RR = 1.4; n = 106). The excess numbers of brain cancer were concentrated within 10 years of hospitalization (RR = 20.7; n = 80) and decreased significantly over time, which suggests that brain tumors account for the seizure disorder and are not due to phenobarbital exposure as suggested by some epidemiologic studies. No overall risk was apparent when brain cancers were excluded (RR = 1.03). Because bladder cancer was significantly decreased (RR = 0.6; n = 18), the excess risk of lung cancer may not have been related to the \"anecdotal\" heavy smoking reported among confined groups of epileptic patients in the early years of the study period. The incidence of malignant melanoma was also significantly low (RR = 0.5; n = 7), which suggested limited exposure to sunlight among confined patients. The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was increased, but not significantly (RR = 1.4; n = 16), which is interesting in view of previous reports suggesting an association with phenytoin. Overall, these data provide little evidence that phenobarbital and phenytoin are carcinogenic to humans, but the excess risks of lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among epileptic patients in our study deserve further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess physicians' attitudes toward the use of deception in medicine, we sent a questionnaire to 407 practicing physicians. The questionnaire asked for responses to difficult ethical problems potentially resolvable by deception and asked general questions about attitudes and practices. Two hundred eleven (52%) of the physicians responded. The majority indicated a willingness to misrepresent a screening test as a diagnostic test to secure an insurance payment and to allow the wife of a patient with gonorrhea to be misled about her husband's diagnosis if that were believed necessary to ensure her treatment and preserve a marriage. One third indicated they would offer incomplete or misleading information to a patient's family if a mistake led to a patient's death. Very few physicians would deceive a mother to avoid revealing an adolescent daughter's pregnancy. When forced to make difficult ethical choices, most physicians indicated some willingness to engage in forms of deception. They appear to justify their decisions in terms of the consequences and to place a higher value on their patients' welfare and keeping patients' confidences than truth telling for its own sake.\r"

  ".W": "Of 18 nonblack patients with sickle cell disease, 14 had sickle cell anemia, 2 had hemoglobin SC disease, and 2 had hemoglobin S-beta o-thalassemia. The beta s gene cluster haplotypes that were determined in 7 patients were of African origin and were identified as Central African Republic, Central African Republic minor II, Benin, and Senegal. The haplotype Central African Republic minor II was present on the beta o-thalassemia chromosome in 2 patients. None of 10 patients whose alpha-gene status was determined had alpha-thalassemia-2. These data strongly support the concept that the beta s gene on chromosome 11 of these individuals is of African origin and that the alpha-gene locus on chromosome 16 is of white or native American origin. The clinical severity of the disease in these nonblack patients is appropriate to their haplotype without alpha-thalassemia-2 and is comparable with that of black patients. All persons with congenital hemolytic anemia should be examined for the presence of sickle cell disease regardless of physical appearance or ethnic background.\r"

  ".W": "Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin (SIE) and hemoglobin levels were measured in 152 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Anemia was present in 18% of asymptomatic patients who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, 50% of patients with a condition related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 75% of patients with AIDS. The mean SIE level for untreated AIDS patients (26.2 +/- 2.4 mU/mL) was greater than for patients who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus or patients with an AIDS-related condition but not outside the normal range for SIE (4 to 26 mU/mL), and the incremental increase in SIE level for a given decline in hemoglobin level was much less in AIDS patients than in patients with uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia. Forty-two patients were treated with zidovudine, and the hemoglobin level fell 10 g/L or more in 48%. In contrast to the untreated patients, however, the mean SIE level rose 10-fold to 214 mU/mL, and the incremental change in SIE level for a given decline in hemoglobin level was markedly increased. In the zidovudine-treated patients, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume also rose significantly from a mean of 88.1 fL to 102 fL. However, in only 1 patient was there a corresponding increase in reticulocytes and in none was there amelioration of anemia. The data indicate that SIE level is inappropriately low in anemic AIDS patients. The ability of these patients to produce erythropoietin is intact and can be expressed with zidovudine therapy. However, even very high levels of SIE fail to stimulate erythropoiesis adequately.\r"
