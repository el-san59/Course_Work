A double-blind, multicentre study was undertaken of 230 primigravid women with 10-12 weeks amenorrhoea who were randomly assigned to groups given 0 (placebo), 25, 50 or 100 mg mifepristone twice at 24 and 12 h before vacuum aspiration. In mifepristone-treated women the cervix was on average between 0.9 and 1.2 mm more dilated at operation, but the effect was not dose related. High resistance during further mechanical stretching tended to be encountered more often and at a smaller cervical diameter in the placebo group than in the women given mifepristone, but these differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, the ease of dilatation assessed subjectively by the operating surgeons was not only improved by the antiprogestin, but was also dose related. Mifepristone therapy was not associated with any side-effects and only two of the women from the highest dose group experienced preoperative vaginal bleeding. Peroperative blood loss, post-operative complications, the duration of post-operative bleeding and the interval to the first period were similar in the four treatment groups.\r"

The trial involved an intake of 734 patients between 1966 and 1975. The classification of all patients has been revised to conform with the latest TNM publication. A reduction in total dose was made for 3F/wk compared with 5F/wk. This varied between 13% and 11% in centres treating over 3 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. No statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms (3F/wk versus 5F/wk) of the trial in any of the main group analyses. A number of sub-group analyses relating to survival, tumour-free and laryngectomy-free rates and to the comparison of acute or late normal-tissue radiation damage have also been performed. No differences have been found that could be considered to be statistically significant in relation to the particular sub-group. Previous interim reports suggested minor differences in sub-group analyses between the 3F/wk and 5F/wk regimes in this trial; these have diminished now that the full follow-up data are available. This trial has provided evidence on which clinicians may base their choice between either a 3F/wk fractionation regime or a conventional 5F/wk treatment protocol in the treatment of carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous digital subtraction angiography was used to determine prospectively the positional variations of the common carotid bifurcation in 100 consecutive patients with clinically suspected arteriosclerotic disease. The most common position (97/200, 48.5%) of the external carotid artery was anteromedial to the internal carotid artery. Position of the external carotid artery anterolateral to the internal carotid artery was noted in 26/200 (13%) bifurcations, but this anatomical variant was more common on the right (21/100) than on the left (5/100) (p less than 0.01). Practical implications may be drawn from this study. For digital subtraction angiography, the left anterior oblique view has to be considered the projection of choice and the right common carotid bifurcation is less likely to be adequately displayed than the left one; for duplex ultrasonography, optimal visualization is obtained from a posterolateral orientation of the transducer.\r"

They identify significant obstacles to the advancement of knowledge in clinical oncology. There is no single or overriding solution to the health care system and its problems with funding and access or to the antiintellectual mood of our times. Continuous efforts to improve science are needed now more than ever. Adequate accession to trials is an ongoing issue. These problems are compounded by the ethical issues created by today's opportunities. The etiquette of territoriality is no less daunting. Each of these affects the environment in which trials are conducted, and each deserves the serious attention of all of us. Some suggestions for action have been made. The need for resolution is obvious.\r"

Other concerns related to the conduct of clinical trials are explored including strategies for assuring the best quality of care for patients involved in these studies. The author suggests several actions to improve public understanding and participation in clinical trials including the development of new educational strategies for presenting information to the public, development of mechanisms for documenting and communicating the quality of care received by patients in clinical trials, and the implementation of quality-of-life assessments in clinical trials to provide an additional outcome measure for clinical situations in which the survival differences between treatments are insignificant. The limited information that is available suggests that the concerns of patients and the public must be addressed if clinical trials are to be successful in recruitment of adequate numbers of subjects to answer important clinical research questions.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the viscoelastic properties of the human aorta in vivo, the pressure-diameter relation was determined in the abdominal aorta in 15 subjects. Diameter was measured noninvasively with a highly sensitive ultrasonic displacement meter, while intra-aortic pressure was measured with a catheter tip micromanometer inserted from the femoral artery. The frequency-dependent changes in the pressure-strain modulus (Ep) of the aorta and the phase lag of diameter to pressure were calculated by frequency analysis of these wave forms at the mean blood pressure of 109 mm Hg. The Ep and the phase lag at the fundamental frequency component (1.2 +/- 0.3 Hz, mean +/- SD) were (1.52 +/- 0.57) x 10(6) dyne/cm2 and -6.7 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees, respectively. Although the phase lag at the fundamental frequency was in good agreement with the published in vitro data, the calculated phase lags above the second harmonic were inconsistent, which was probably due to the nonlinearity in the pressure-diameter relation. To separate the effect of this nonlinearity, analysis was conducted with a model consisting of a static nonlinear component representing the elasticity and a dynamic linear component representing the viscosity. This method of analysis revealed that the phase lag due to the viscous component provided relatively flat frequency response to the 10th harmonic. It was confirmed that the aortic wall viscosity showed no apparent difference between the in vivo and the in vitro experimental conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The study of the biologic effects of extracellular ATP is rapidly progressing from cataloging the integrated biologic responses of isolated tissues to characterizing the biochemical basis of signal transduction in isolated cells. Clearly, many fundamental issues remain; these include the classification of receptor subtypes, identification of defined or new signal-transduction pathways, generation of specific high-affinity ligands for the various ATP receptor subtypes, and ultimately, the development of protocols for the identification, isolation, cloning, and physicochemical characterization of the receptor moities per se. Such work will be essential for developing selective ATP-receptor antagonists. Such antagonists, in turn, will facilitate evaluation of the role of these receptors in physiological and/or pathological processes. A possible therapeutic role for drugs selective for these receptors is suggested by the critical pathophysiological roles of the human cell types (phagocytic leukocytes, vascular endothelial cells) known to express such receptors. The earlier, seminal work on the biologic actions of extracellular ATP was largely performed by smooth-muscle physiologists and pharmacologists. With the expanding range of, and interest in, this topic, recent studies have been carried out largely by diverse groups of pharmacologists, neurobiologists, physiologists, and biochemists. Not surprisingly, these various scientists often investigate certain aspects of extracellular ATP action from different perspectives, using the specialized tools and methods of their respective disciplines. Hopefully, by integrating these interdisciplinary perspectives on the biologic actions of extracellular ATP, there will be rapid progress in this field during the next few years.\r"

To obtain the maximal amount of information using this technique, certain basic principles relating to regional myocardial mechanics during ischemia and flow-function relations are required. In addition, a detailed knowledge of cardiac anatomy and the three-dimensional orientation of the heart within the chest cavity is required to access meaningful information from two-dimensional planes. Furthermore, skill is also required in acquiring data in proper imaging planes and in separating true (actual pathology) from the false (artifacts, etc.). Echocardiography is not a \"mature\" technology. It is still developing and it is sometimes difficult to keep up with the advances. However, keeping abreast of these developments is essential to fully exploit the advantages of this technique. In addition, knowledge of the ever-changing aspects of CAD is required in order to correctly interpret visual information in context of a particular patient. Finally, more clinical studies are needed to further define the role of echocardiographic techniques in patients with CAD.\r"

Comparison of histological findings and measurement of the cross-section suggested that the ulcers observed in the ultrasonographic photographs were essentially equivalent to those in histological photographs. By using endoscopic ultrasonography, we then examined 16 patients with active, mainly recurrent, gastric ulcers before and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of H2 blocker treatment, measuring the length and cross-sectional area of the ulcer in endoscopic ultrasonographic photographs. From measurements of the contraction rate of cross-sectional ulcer area during healing, we observed that the healed ulcers showed a relatively rapid rate of contraction in the first 4 weeks of therapy and the non-healed cases showed a poor contraction rate. Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful for the quantitative estimation of histological changes associated with gastric ulcer healing.\r"

On August 24, 1898 his assistant, a Dr. Hildebrandt, attempted to administer a spinal anesthetic to Dr. Bier; it was never completed because the syringe did not fit the already implanted spinal needle. Bier himself suggested that continued leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the dural puncture site was the cause of headache, a theory that has been embraced by the medical community; however, the mechanism is probably more complex. Nearly 50 years ago, J. Lawrence Pool, using an endoscopic technique to visualize the surface of the spinal cord and the cauda equina, frequently observed large collections of epidural fluid two to four days following lumbar puncture in patients without headache. Evidence that will be presented below suggests that CSF volume alterations may be the signal closest to the headache mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "To study vascular abnormalities in migraine, transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used for evaluation of 100 consecutive patients with either common or classic migraine during the headache-free period. We insonated the basal cerebral arteries and the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the neck. Particular ultrasonic features in migraineurs included intracranial elevations of mean flow velocity (MFV) above 3 standard deviations of normal values in 16%, probably reflecting increased vasotonus. Marked asymmetry of MFV in corresponding intracranial arteries was found in 12%, and could represent \"asymmetrical\" vascular tone. Characteristic vascular bruits of low frequency and sometimes harmonic quality were detected in 56%. When compared to TCD findings in 40 young controls, MFV were significantly higher in all intracranial arteries in migraineurs, but not in the cervical ICA. Marked differences were also found for incidence of MFV elevations and vascular bruits (p less than 0.0001). Vascular reactivity in response to eye closing as measured by flow changes in the posterior cerebral artery (visually evoked flow) was significantly greater in migraineurs than in controls (%MFV change, 14.1 +/- 5.4 vs 11.4 +/- 4.8; p = 0.004). TCD features did not discriminate common from classic migraine. Taken together, our results support the view of intracranial vascular abnormality in migraineurs reflecting, in particular, a narrower and more reactive arterial tree. The value of TCD in the differential diagnosis of \"vascular headache\" and in the study of migraine pathophysiology will have to be determined in the future.\r"

  ".W": "Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examinations were performed in 13 patients with common and 5 patients with classic migraine during attacks and compared to TCD findings during the headache-free period. Two distinct patterns of flow changes were detected to distinguish common from classic migraine on the basis of TCD findings. During attacks, patients with common migraine exhibited reduction of flow velocities associated with an increase of pulse wave amplitudes. Vascular bruits that were heard during the headache-free interval often disappeared. Opposite changes were found in attacks of classic migraine during the headache phase with increase of flow velocities, decrease of pulsatility and more prominent or newly appearing bruits. These findings were often diffuse and did not appear to correlate with side of headache or side of neurological aura. Uniform changes occurred in the cervical internal carotid artery and the basal cerebral arteries in either form of migraine. We propose that these changes represent caliber fluctuations of the large arteries, suggesting vasodilatation during attacks of common migraine and vasoconstriction during attacks of classic migraine. We do not intend to imply a casual role of these preliminary findings in migraine pathogenesis, but we suggest that TCD be used in combination with other methods to study vascular changes in migrainous disorders.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the GnRH gene structure in a family with familial central precocious puberty (eight members, four affected) and a family with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (eight members, three affected) using Southern blot analysis and sequencing of cloned polymerase chain reaction products. Genomic DNA samples were digested with restriction enzymes and hybridized to the human placental GnRH cDNA probe. BamHI digests revealed 6.5- and 2.7-kilobase (kb) bands; BglII, 6.0- and 4.0-kb bands; Ncol, 8.0- and 3.5-kb bands; Pstl, 4.2-kb, 2.8-kb, 1.3-kb and 950-basepair bands; XbaI, 6.5- and 5.0-kb bands. These sizes were the same as those found by this analysis in normal individuals. All family members with familial central precocious puberty or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism showed the same size bands, except for one unaffected member of the family with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who had an additional band at 5.5 kb after digestion with NcoI, which is thought to be a rare polymorphism. Sequencing of exon 2 of the GnRH gene from these families, including the exon-intron borders, revealed a polymorphism in the signal sequence of GnRH that predicts an amino acid change from tryptophan (nucleotide sequence: TGG) to serine (TCG) at the -8 position of the GnRH preprohormone. Although this polymorphism did not cosegregate with the clinical disorder in either family, this novel polymorphism may prove useful in the evaluation of linkage to the GnRH gene in other families with pubertal disorders. No other nucleotide sequence abnormality was found in 1.2 kb of the 5' flanking region or the four exons and their splice sites.\r"

  ".W": "Fasting serum total immunoreactive insulin (IRI), true insulin, and true proinsulin (PI) were measured in 169 Pima Indians. The relationship of these variables to glucose tolerance, obesity, and parental diabetes was studied. Seventy-seven subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 46 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 46 had noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) by WHO criteria. In subjects with normal glucose tolerance, the geometric mean ratio of PI to IRI (PI/IRI) was 10.8% (arithmetic mean, 12.5%), similar to that reported in other ethnic groups with lower prevalence rates of NIDDM. Parental diabetes had no effect on PI/IRI. Obese persons (body mass index, greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2) with normal glucose tolerance had PI/IRI of 9.3% compared with 16.3% for the nonobese (P less than 0.001), and PI/IRI was negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.34; P = 0.002). Proinsulin was disproportionately elevated in NIDDM (geometric mean PI/IRI, 19.9%; arithmetic mean, 23.6%), and the degree of elevation was related to the severity of hyperglycemia, but not the duration of diabetes. Subjects with IGT were more obese and had higher fasting plasma glucose (5.7 vs. 5.2 mmol/L; P = 0.025), true insulin (250 vs. 125 pmol/L; P less than 0.001), and PI concentrations (26 vs. 15 pmol/L; P less than 0.001) than those with normal glucose tolerance but similar mean PI/IRI (9.4 vs. 10.8%; P = 0.4). These findings indicate that Pima Indians with NIDDM have a disproportionate elevation of PI consistent with the hypothesis that beta-cell dysfunction associated with hyperglycemia leads to the release of proinsulin-rich immature granules.\r"

There were two dropouts from the bromocriptine group and one from the SMS 201-995 group. Amelioration of clinical signs and symptoms was seen in both groups during treatment. After 8 weeks mean 12-h GH concentrations had declined from 13.8 +/- 5.2 to 2.9 +/- 4.4 (mean +/- SEM) in SMS 201-995-treated and from 18.8 +/- 7.5 to 5.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L in bromocriptine-treated patients. Somatomedin-C concentrations fell from 3.04 +/- 0.36 to 1.43 +/- 0.36 in SMS 201-995-treated and from 2.93 +/- 0.40 to 2.13 +/- 0.27 U/mL in bromocriptine-treated patients. Size reduction of the pituitary tumor was seen in one patient receiving bromocriptine. Gastrointestinal glucose absorption was delayed, and insulin secretion suppressed during treatment with SMS 201-995. Hemoglobin-A1 concentrations remained unchanged in SMS 201-995-treated patients, but declined in the bromocriptine group. Side-effects were common, but usually tolerable, with both treatments. It is concluded that both drugs are of benefit in the treatment of acromegaly.\r"

These studies describe the initial characterization of the blood-borne mitogenic factor(s) from preeclamptic women which we have named ELMER (Endogenous Ligand conferring MitogEnic Response). ELMER appears to be a unique mitogen with characteristics that are not identical to those of other known growth factors. ELMER is present in serum as an acid- and heat-labile protein, approximately 160,000 daltons in size, which is a potent mitogen for human fibroblasts but not for human endothelial cells. Its presence in plasma suggests that it is a circulating factor rather than a product of blood coagulation ex vivo. We believe that ELMER represents a potential serum marker of preeclampsia and that it may play roles in the vasospasm and proliferative vascular lesion, termed atherosis, frequently associated with the preeclamptic syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "90243828\r", 
  ".W": "A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, MK-329, was used to explore the physiological role of CCK in regulating pancreatic endocrine function in humans. The ability of CCK to increase plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) concentrations and blockade of this effect with MK-329 were evaluated in a double blind, balanced, four-period cross-over study. Eight subjects received single oral doses of 0.5, 2, or 10 mg MK-329 or placebo, followed by an iv infusion of CCK-8 (34 ng/kg.h). In placebo-treated subjects, PP increased from basal levels of 70 +/- 15 (+/- SE) to peak values of 291 +/- 58 pg/mL after CCK infusion (P less than 0.05 compared to basal). This increase in plasma PP concentration was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by MK-329, with 10 mg antagonizing the stimulatory effect of CCK infusion by nearly 80%. Second, the effect of MK-329 on meal-stimulated pancreatic endocrine responses was evaluated by giving placebo or 10 mg MK-329 2 h before ingestion of a mixed meal. Eight subjects were treated in a randomized two-period cross-over fashion. With placebo treatment, peak postprandial plasma insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations were 101 +/- 8 microU/mL, 195 +/- 15 pg/mL, and 150 +/- 10 mg/dL, respectively (all P less than 0.05). The integrated PP response following the meal was 56.3 +/- 11.1 ng/mL.minute. With MK-329 treatment, the integrated PP concentration was reduced to 33.9 +/- 2.2 ng/mL.min (P less than 0.05 compared to placebo treatment). Mean postprandial insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations did not differ between placebo and MK-329 treatments. We conclude that CCK receptor blockade with 10 mg MK-329 does not alter plasma insulin, glucagon, or glucose responses to a mixed meal. However, the observation that physiological concentrations of CCK increase plasma levels of PP, and the finding that CCK receptor blockade selectively attenuates the postprandial increase in plasma PP concentrations support a physiological role for CCK in regulating PP secretion.\r"

  ".W": "This study was carried out to determine whether hepatic glucose production (HGP) could be suppressed in normal subjects by infusing different amounts of glucose, in the absence of significant changes in steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) or insulin (SSPI) concentrations. Consequently, subjects were infused with somatostatin (215 nmol/h), insulin (28.7 pmol/m2.min), and amounts of glucose varying from 0-200 mumol/m2.min in the absence or presence of glucagon (5.2 pmol/m2.min). SSPI concentrations were constant (60-70 pmol/L) during these studies, and values for the total glucose appearance rate (glucose infusion rate plus HGP) and SSPG did not vary significantly as a function of the rate of exogenous glucose infusion. However, values for HGP fell in response to increases in glucose infusion rate and could be suppressed to approximately 50% of the original value despite the fact that SSPG, SSPI, and glucose appearance rate did not change significantly. These data indicate that HGP can be regulated by varying the rate of exogenous glucose infusion during glucose clamp studies.\r"

  ".U": "90243840\r", 
  ".W": "A 44-yr-old man with hypocortisolism was shown to have an undetectable basal plasma ACTH level and absent or subnormal ACTH and beta-lipotropin responses to provocative testing with insulin, vasopressin, and CRH. Endocrine function after glucocorticoid replacement was otherwise normal, thus establishing the diagnosis of isolated ACTH deficiency. This patient's serum was tested immunohistochemically for the presence of an antipituitary antibody by indirect immunofluorescence of rat pituitary tissue. Positive immunostaining was observed in stellate-shaped cells in the anterior and intermediate lobes. Immunopositive cells were shown by immunoelectron microscopy to have ultrastructural characteristics of corticotrophs. Immunoreactivity was concentrated in secretory granules 120-170 nm in diameter. In a double immunolabeling procedure, staining by the patient's serum was shown to colocalize with rabbit antiserum to ACTH, but not with antisera to PRL, GH, beta TSH, or beta LH. Immunoabsorption of the patient's serum with ACTH-(1-24), ACTH-(1-39), gamma MSH, corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide, beta-endorphin, or beta-lipotropin failed to diminish immunolabeling in the pituitary. We conclude that the antipituitary antibody in this patient's serum shows immunohistochemical specificity for a rat corticotroph antigen located in secretory granules that is neither ACTH nor any of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides tested. The autoantigen could be a cell-specific granular factor involved in the posttranslational processing of POMC or secretion of ACTH. We postulate that an autoimmune process may account for this patient's disease, and that his antipituitary antibody could play a pathogenic role by either inhibiting a POMC-processing enzyme or initiating an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reaction, resulting in the selective destruction of corticotrophs.\r"

We also measured the responses to physostigmine of plasma GH, arginine vasopressin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine (NE). As estimated by comparing calculated areas under the curve, older subjects had greater cortisol (P = 0.02) and beta-endorphin (P less than 0.01) secretory responses, but a reduced GH (P less than 0.01) secretory response. The arginine vasopressin response did not differ between groups. By analysis of variance, older subjects also had a greater epinephrine response (P = 0.01). Older subjects had higher basal NE concentrations (P less than 0.05), but NE responses to physostigmine did not differ between groups. These findings suggest age-related enhancement of the cholinergic stimulatory regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal medulla. They also confirm previous reports of reduced GH secretory response with aging in normal men.\r"

  ".U": "90243849\r", 
  ".W": "Serum GH levels were measured by RIA and RRA in 133 subjects (19 healthy controls and 114 patients with various growth disturbances, aged 2.3-24.8 yr). Serum samples obtained from 147 stimulation tests representing a total of 1065 samples were analyzed by both methods, and the results compared. The data are expressed in absolute values and in RRA/RIA ratios. The area under the curve after a stimulation test (area GH) was calculated by planimetry. RIA was performed by the classical double antibody method using a polyclonal anti-serum. For the RRA, human cultured lymphocytes (IM-9 cells) were used, and 125I-labeled human GH was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The same human GH standard was used in both assay systems. In control subjects a significant (P less than 0.0001) positive correlation was found at all ages between GH levels measured by RIA and RRA (r = 0.69 after insulin and r = 0.77 after glucagon). The RRA/RIA ratio (mean +/- SEM) for the peak GH level was 0.88 +/- 0.05, and the area under the GH curve was 0.85 +/- 0.05. The peak mean RRA/RIA ratios were significantly lower (P less than 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively). No relationship was found with the absolute value of either peak or area GH. In patients with growth delay and Turner's syndrome, lower GH levels were found than in control subjects in both assay systems. The RRA/RIA ratios were also lower. In the other patients with some growth disorder, normal GH levels and ratios were found. In patients with renal failure, high levels of RIA-GH and RRA-GH were found, with a normal RRA/RIA ratio. In patients with documented pituitary GH deficiency, GH-releasing factor administration resulted in an increase in GH levels that was identical in both assays. The RRA/RIA ratio remained constant throughout the test. No correlation was found between the ratio and the absolute value of either RIA-GH or RRA-GH regardless of the stimulation test used. It is concluded that the presence of an abnormal GH molecule is extremely rare in patients with short stature. Thus, the presence of a bioinactive hormone is not a common cause of growth failure. During provocative testing some changes in the ratio may occur that do not appear after GH-releasing factor, further illustrating the different mechanisms involved in GH secretion.\r"

A number of studies using appropriate levels of high biologic value protein, vitamin and mineral supplementation, and careful monitoring have shown that the VLCD can be safe. Careful monitoring by a physician experienced in such programs and by a registered dietitian is essential. The maintenance of weight loss must be of key importance throughout the program, necessitating the skills of a multidisciplinary team with medical, nutritional, and behavioral training. It must be recognized that the VLCD is only one part of a total weight management program. The complete program is needed for long-term success. Insurance reimbursement for the services of all members of the health care team, including dietitians, facilitates and supports the multidisciplinary team approach. Potential candidates for this program and health professionals must realize that VLCDs are not for everyone and can be harmful for persons who do not meet the following selection criteria: (a) at least 30% overweight, with a minimum body mass index of 32. (b) free from contraindicated medical conditions: pregnancy or lactation, active cancer, hepatic disease, renal failure, active cardiac dysfunction, or severe psychological disturbances. (c) committed to establishing new eating and life-style behaviors that will assist the maintenance of weight loss. (d) committed to taking the time to complete both the treatment and the maintenance components of a program. Dieters must receive careful medical and nutritional monitoring throughout the program and should continue with nutrition, exercise, and behavioral counseling after cessation of the VLCD until sound eating and life-style habits can be established. The length of time an individual is on the VLCD must be carefully monitored and the VLCD discontinued immediately if medical tests and/or weight loss indicate increased health risks to the client. Finally, potential clients must be adequately warned that there are limitations and risks involved with the VLCD. A VLCD is no magic cure. It requires considerable effort and commitment on the part of both practitioners and participants to ensure the program's success.\r"

T cells from old mice also exhibit a defect in the generation of cytoplasmic calcium signals after stimulation with Con A. To see if the increase in Pgp-1+ T cells could account for defective calcium signal generation in old mice, we carried out flow cytometric analyses to examine calcium signal production in T cells expressing high or low levels of the Pgp-1 marker. We report here that Pgp-1+ T cells, from both old and young mice, do indeed generate relatively poor Ca2+ responses when exposed either to receptor-dependent mitogens (e.g., Con A and anti-CD3) or to activators like ionomycin that bypass receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways. Both CD4 (helper) and CD8 (killer) T cells show poor calcium responses. These data suggest that the shift, with age, toward Pgp-1+ T cells, which are relatively refractory to stimuli that raise intracellular calcium concentrations, may contribute to poor cell-mediated immune function in old animals.\r"

Swollen neurons are widely distributed in the cerebral cortex and are most abundant in the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri. They are more numerous in the panencephalopathic type of CJD than in the subacute spongiform encephalopathic type. A phosphorylated epitope of NFP was detected in the perikarya of swollen neurons by an immunocytochemical method using a series of monoclonal antibodies that distinguish phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated epitopes of NFP. This abnormal distribution of phosphorylated NFP epitopes indicates that the process of NFP phosphorylation is altered in neurons affected by CJD. This investigation, in accordance with previous studies, suggests that the abnormal post-translational modification of the neurofilament may play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders.\r"

Statistical comparison revealed a greater proportion of men in group I (66%, 55%, p = 0.0186) and a greater proportion of patients in group II with contralateral carotid stenosis (24%, 33%, p = 0.0382) and stroke as a preoperative indication for operation (14%, 22%, p = 0.0393). No statistical difference was found between group I and group II as regards other operative indications, contralateral carotid occlusion, bilaterality of operation, emergency operation, operation for recurrent carotid disease, frequency of shunt use, perioperative wound bleeding, and perioperative transient ischemic attack. Ipsilateral perioperative stroke occurred in 12 patients (2%), with all strokes occurring in the younger group of patients (2.4%) (NS). Perioperative death occurred in six (1%) patients, with five deaths (1%) occurring in the younger group (cardiac, 2; stroke, 2; protamine reaction, 1) and one (0.9%) death occurring in the elderly group of patients (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm) (NS). Life-table analysis of the late results of the 115 elderly patients revealed cumulative survival rates of 85.4% and 63.8% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. The principal causes of late death were cardiac (48%), cancer (15%), and stroke (9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The internal mammary artery is used with increasing frequency for myocardial revascularization. However, preoperative coronary angiography does not always provide adequate visualization of subclavian arteries. If a proximal subclavian artery stenosis exists or develops in a patient who has myocardial revascularization with the internal mammary artery, graft malfunction can occur resulting in myocardial ischemia. We have identified four cases of internal mammary artery graft malfunction at our own institution and identified an additional 12 cases from the literature. These 16 cases are analyzed for age, sex, time of onset of symptoms, clinical findings, method of revascularization, and long-term follow-up. Sixty-three percent of the patients were men, and the mean age was 52.9 +/- 9.0 years. Onset of symptoms occurred after a mean interval of 25.1 months from the time of myocardial revascularization. Three patients had asymptomatic reversal of flow in the internal mammary artery as diagnosed by coronary arteriography during routine follow-up examination before 1980. One death after internal mammary artery-coronary bypass grafting was related to immediate malfunction. In the remaining 12 patients with symptomatic malfunction, all but one were treated by placement of a carotid-subclavian bypass graft with no mortality. Relief of myocardial ischemia was complete in 93% of the patients with a mean follow-up of 29.3 months. Carotid-subclavian bypass grafting appears to be the treatment of choice for the usual management of internal mammary artery graft dysfunction. Careful preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of the subclavian arteries, even by simple comparison of bilateral arm blood pressure should help reduce the incidence of this syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Results of scans performed on 1074 patients over an 18-month period were evaluated to define the limitations of lower extremity venous duplex scanning. Eighty-four patients had confirmatory phlebography performed within 24 hours of their venous duplex scanning. In 71 patients scans were considered diagnostic (sensitivity 91%, specificity 95%). Eighteen studies (13 equivocal, 5 misinterpretations) were scrutinized to determine the limitations of venous duplex scanning compared to phlebography and are the focus of this analysis. Seven patients had phlebograms documenting only infrapopliteal thrombus, seven had normal phlebographic findings, and four had findings consistent with chronic thrombosis. In the seven patients with infrapopliteal thrombus, four had normal imaging outcomes but abnormal Doppler flow patterns, whereas three had both normal imaging results and flow patterns. All four patients with chronic thrombosis had identifiable thrombus and abnormal flow patterns by venous duplex scanning, but in each case thrombus age was indeterminate. Of the seven patients with normal phlebographic results, five had incompressible segments of the superficial femoral vein on imaging, one had abnormal Doppler flow without visualized thrombus and without apparent reason, one had venous duplex scanning visualized thrombus with a normal outcome on phlebography. These data suggest that the diagnostic yield of lower extremity venous duplex scanning may be improved by (1) meticulous infrapopliteal vein examination, (2) better estimation of the age of the thrombotic process, and (3) recognizing segmental incompressibility of the superficial femoral vein within the adductor canal as a normal finding especially in the absence of abnormal Doppler flow or imaged thrombus.\r"

Duplex scanning was used to measure peak systolic flow velocity and mean velocity at angles from 30 degrees to 80 degrees; individual measurements were made at 10-degree increments in both the common carotid artery and the superior mesenteric artery in normal subjects. Peak systolic velocity in the common carotid artery varied from 86 cm/sec at 30 degrees to 168 m/sec at 80 degrees. Over the same transducer angle variation mean velocity ranged from 28 to 53 cm/sec. Similar changes in the superior mesenteric artery flow velocities were observed by varying the angle of insonation, where peak systolic velocity varied from 108 cm/sec (30 degrees) to 280 cm/sec (80 degrees), and mean velocity ranged from 29 cm/sec (30 degrees) to 71 cm/sec (80 degrees). Measurements taken from 70 to 80 degrees produced the most dramatic deviation from those taken at 60 degrees. In the common carotid artery the 70- and 80-degree angles produced 14% and 59% increases, respectively, in peak systolic velocity and 16% and 63% increases, respectively, in mean velocity. In the superior mesenteric artery 70-degree and 80-degree angles produced 16% and 120% increases, respectively, in peak systolic velocity and 17% and 111% increases, respectively, in mean velocity. At 80 degrees the percent increases in measured flow velocities for the superior mesenteric artery were significantly greater than those for the common carotid artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This asthmatic constitution consisted of a predisposition to allergy, airways hyperresponsiveness, and possibly eosinophilia. Other investigators, however, regarded CAO as simply the late stage of chronic bronchitis. The term chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) was developed to resolve what was largely a semantic difference. In subsequent years, the term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has come to be used more often than COLD to describe these patients. This article discusses the differences between these terms and defines the causes and risk factors associated with each.\r"

  ".W": "The idea that increases in airways responsiveness--either as a result of exposure to cigarette smoke and/or pre-existing increases in bronchial responsiveness, possibly genetically mediated--might be causal in the pathogenesis of the development of COPD in cigarette smokers presents an attractive hypothesis. The fact that a relatively small proportion of cigarette smokers develop COPD begs for specific susceptibilities as an explanation of selective pathogenesis. In our view, the evidence for modest increases in airways responsiveness in cigarette smokers who do not have asthma or allergies is convincing. Such increases in bronchial responsiveness are modest when compared to patients with asthma and may have a different mechanism. However, the demonstration by Verma et al that two types of patients with cigarette smoke-induced COPD, \"bronchitis\" patients and \"emphysematous\" patients, have virtually identical alterations in bronchial responsiveness, and that these alterations appear to be a function of airways caliber, has led us to believe that the changes in airways tone in patients with COPD may be reflective more of changes in airways geometry imposed by the development of disease rather than a measurement of a risk factor in the development of COPD. Of the epidemiologic studies that have emerged throughout the 1980s, problems of possible inclusion of asthmatic subjects in the study groups and of baseline airflow rates as a function of bronchial responsiveness have limited the ability of data to implicate increases in airways responsiveness as a risk factor in the development of COPD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In COLD, the inspiratory muscles are severely disadvantaged by virtue of the hyperinflation that accompanies this disorder. Such mechanical disadvantage will lead clinically, in the stable patient, to the active recruitment of the accessory muscles of inspiration and to a pattern of rapid, shallow breathing that may be due to either peripheral (muscle) or central (neurogenic) influences thought to be linked to a critical tension-time index of the inspiratory muscles. This pattern appears to be all the more pronounced in the patient with acute respiratory failure and is frequently accompanied by disordered rib cage-abdominal movements. While these movements may reflect the muscles' attempts to stave off fatigue, they may also imply that if the imposed mechanical stress is unrelieved, muscle failure will ensue. In the laboratory, mechanical disadvantage is marked by diminished inspiratory mouth pressures. Because of wide scatter, a low mouth pressure beyond that which can be explained by hyperinflation alone should be confirmed by an assessment of Pesosniff or by the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure. Muscle endurance, also compromised in this condition, can be assessed indirectly by the measurement of MVV or MSVC, or more directly by an invasive assessment of the tension-time index and endurance time of the diaphragm or noninvasively by the Endurance Index of McKenzie and Gandevia. And finally, once muscle failure is pending or has been established, a program of muscle rest, either complete or partial, pharmacotherapy, and goal-specific training should be instituted.\r"

  ".U": "90244797\r", 
  ".W": "Several studies of corticosteroid efficacy in patients with COPD performed in the last decade have had stronger study designs and larger patient populations than most of the previously reported investigations. These studies have provided evidence of the objective benefit of corticosteroid therapy on pulmonary function in clinically stable COPD patients. These positive results are due to a relatively marked beneficial effect of corticosteroids in a minority of the subjects studied rather than a modest effect in the majority of subjects. A controlled randomized trial of intravenous corticosteroid administration in patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure admitted to the hospital showed improvement in pulmonary function from 12 hours following initial administration through the remainder of the 3 days of the study in the treatment group as compared to the control group. A greater percentage of patients showed a beneficial response to corticosteroids in this study of patients with acute exacerbations as compared to most of the studies of clinically stable COPD patients with beneficial effects. This suggests the possibility that some patients may show a beneficial response to corticosteroids during an acute exacerbation although they have not shown a response when clinically stable. The response to inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD has not been studied as extensively as the response to oral corticosteroids. However, some studies have shown a beneficial response to inhaled corticosteroids, primarily but not exclusively, in individuals who have also shown a positive response to oral agents. Generally, the response in terms of improved pulmonary function has been less striking with the inhaled agent as compared to the oral drug, although higher relative doses of the oral drugs usually were studied. Several limitations of the currently available studies are evident. Most of the studies deal with the effects in clinically stable outpatients with COPD and no studies have dealt with maintenance therapy in patients who have responded to a 1 to 2 week course of 30 mg of prednisone or greater. Data on the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD patients are limited. No studies have investigated the role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations in outpatients with COPD. Recommendations are given regarding use of corticosteroids in patients with COPD. A trial of corticosteroids is recommended at some point during a patient's course, while clinically stable. If a beneficial response is obtained in terms of improvement in airflow obstruction, then clinical judgment must be used regarding whether maintenance therapy is continued and, if so, at what dose and by what route.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Adequate control of chronic asthma with clearly defined treatment goals, accompanied by early recognition and patient-initiated treatment of worsened asthma, generally with inhaled/ingested corticosteroid, can successfully reduce the high morbidity and the low, but significant, mortality from this common condition.\r"

  ".W": "The development of computer-aided instructional (CAI) systems suffers from a lack of a cohesive theory of learning--how do students acquire and store knowledge? From studies of computer systems that learn and tutor, we can infer generic activities that appear to be integral parts of the learning process, such as aggregation, clustering, characterization, and storage for later retrieval. Learning is faster and more efficient if the goal of a task is made explicit. Hints should be given with the correct timing in relation to an objective so that students can advance in their own problem-solving strategies with the prerequisites in mind. The general form of a rule should usually be taught first, followed by exceptions and special instances. We review theories of learning associated with CAI that illustrate the classification of different types of knowledge. Rule-based (if-then) knowledge forms are represented in these theories, as are declarative and causal knowledge structures. Extracting the common themes from different classifications of knowledge may help us create better CAI.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow suppression and anemia are frequent side effects of treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with zidovudine (formerly azidothymidine [AZT]). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of recombinant human erythropoietin (100 U per kilogram of body weight thrice weekly by intravenous bolus) in 63 patients with AIDS treated with zidovudine (29 in the erythropoietin group and 34 in the placebo group). Reductions in the number of units of red cells transfused and the number of patients given transfusions per month became apparent in the second and third months of the trial. The reductions were observed in patients with endogenous erythropoietin levels less than or equal to 500 IU per liter at base line, but not in patients whose levels were greater than 500 IU per liter at the beginning of the study. Although the hematocrit and hemoglobin level were not used as the primary criteria of efficacy because the patients received transfusions when their physicians decided that they needed them, a significantly higher rate of increase in the hematocrit was observed in the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin whose levels of endogenous erythropoietin were less than or equal to 500 IU per liter (0.00353 points per week) than in the patients given placebo (0.00116 points per week). This effect was not seen in patients with higher levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Serious side effects did not occur more often in the group treated with erythropoietin than in the placebo group. We conclude that recombinant human erythropoietin may be useful in patients with AIDS treated with zidovudine, although the indicators for its use remain to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of informing physicians of the charges for outpatient diagnostic tests on their ordering of such tests in an academic primary care medical practice. All tests were ordered at microcomputer workstations by 121 physicians. For half (the intervention group), the charge for the test being ordered and the total charge for tests for that patient on that day were displayed on the computer screen. The remaining physicians (control group) also used the computers but received no message about charges. The primary outcomes measured were the number of tests ordered and the charges for tests per patient visit. In the 14 weeks before the study, the number of tests ordered and the average charge for tests per patient visit were similar for the intervention and control groups. During the 26-week intervention period, the physicians in the intervention group ordered 14 percent fewer tests per patient visit than did those in the control group (P less than 0.005), and the charges for tests were 13 percent ($6.68 per visit) lower (P less than 0.05). The differences were greater for scheduled visits (17 percent fewer tests and 15 percent lower charges for the intervention group; P less than 0.01) than for unscheduled (urgent) visits (11 percent fewer tests and 10 percent lower charges; P greater than 0.3). During the 19 weeks after the intervention ended, the number of tests ordered by the physicians in the intervention group was only 7.7 percent lower than the number ordered by the physicians in the control group, and the charges for tests were only 3.5 percent lower (P greater than 0.3). Three measures of possible adverse outcomes--number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatient visits during the study period and the following six months--were similar for the patients seen by the physicians in both groups. We conclude that displaying the charges for diagnostic tests significantly reduced the number and cost of tests ordered, especially for patients with scheduled visits. The effects of this intervention did not persist after it was discontinued.\r"

We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. GAD is an enzyme selectively concentrated in neurons secreting the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and in pancreatic beta cells. We subsequently observed autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons in 20 of 33 patients with stiff-man syndrome. GAD was the principal autoantigen. In the group of patients positive for autoantibodies against GABA-ergic neurons, there was a striking association with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our findings also indicate that autoantibodies directed against GABA-ergic neurons are a useful marker in the diagnosis of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized trial in a community rehabilitation hospital to determine the effect of treatment in a geriatric assessment unit on the physical function, institutionalization rate, and mortality of elderly patients. Functionally impaired elderly patients (mean age, 78.8 years) who were recovering from acute medical or surgical illnesses and were considered at risk for nursing home placement were randomly assigned either to the geriatric assessment unit (n = 78) or to a control group that received usual care (n = 77). The two groups were similar at entry and were stratified according to the perceived risk of an immediate nursing home placement. After six months, the patients treated in the geriatric assessment unit had significantly more functional improvement in three of eight basic self-care activities (P less than 0.05). Those in the lower-risk stratum had significantly more improvement in seven of eight self-care activities. Both six weeks and six months after randomization, significantly more patients treated in the geriatric assessment unit than controls (79 vs. 61 percent after six months) were residing in the community. During the year of follow-up, the control patients had more nursing home stays of six months or longer (10 vs. 3; P less than 0.05). However, there was no difference between the groups in the mean number of days spent in health care facilities (acute care hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation hospital). Survival analysis showed a trend toward fewer deaths among the patients treated in the geriatric assessment unit, and mortality was significantly reduced in the patients considered to be at lower risk of immediate nursing home placement (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the treatment of selected elderly patients in a specialized geriatric rehabilitation unit improves function, decreases the risk of nursing home placement, and may reduce mortality. The beneficial effects on mortality and function appear greatest for patients at a moderate rather than high risk of nursing home placement.\r"

  ".U": "90245097\r", 
  ".W": "The contraction of skeletal muscle is regulated by calcium binding to troponin C (TnC). TnC consists of two spatially independent domains, each of which contains two metal ion binding sites. Calcium binding to the regulatory sites of the N-terminal domain triggers muscle contraction by a series of conformational changes. Site-directed mutagenesis offers a means of elucidating the links in this signal path between TnC and actin-myosin crossbridges. Such mapping is possible if the mutants shift the equilibrium between 'on' and 'off' states of the regulatory complex while maintaining the coupling between calcium binding and tension development. Candidate amino-acid residues for yielding this information would be in positions remote from the calcium-binding sites and from the site of development of tension. Analysis of the crystal structure of TnC and of the model of the calcium-activated molecule has enabled us to identify two such residues: Glu 57 and Glu 88. In separate experiments we have replaced each of these residues by lysines. The resulting reduction in calcium affinity indicates that these residues have a long-range effect on calcium binding. This result may reflect the formation of a salt bridge between positions 57 and 88 that is not present in the native molecule. Moreover, the level of tension recovery when the mutants are incorporated into muscle suggests that the interaction between TnC and other muscle components has also been altered. Thus, these residues may participate in the contraction signal transmission.\r"

The essential fatty acids in the fat, the degree of their unsaturation, and the location of the unsaturation are all important in determining the influence of a dietary fat source on carcinogenesis. In addition, alterations in dietary fat can modify various sites and forms of cancer differently. Dietary fat has been clearly shown to be important in the promotion of cancer, and recent studies indicate that dietary fat can also be a factor in the initiation of cancer. Although the calories contributed by a high-fat diet also factor into cancer enhancement, dietary fat appears to contribute more than its high-caloric density. One potential mechanism for the influence of dietary fat on carcinogenesis is through modulating the activation of protein kinase C.\r"

When rodents are fed high-fat diets, the incidence of mammary tumors sharply increases and latency of tumor appearance is greatly diminished, as compared with the same parameters in animals fed low levels of fat. Despite advances in surgical technique and the development of aggressive therapies for the treatment of primary cancers, most deaths in humans with cancer are caused by metastasis. Accordingly, we have reviewed the process of metastasis and have focused on the question of whether dietary fat can play a role. Metastasis is a complex, multistep, progressive process, and dietary fats may affect specific events such as implantation, survival, and proliferation of tumors. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms by which dietary fat can modulate metastasis. Available data lead us to stress the importance of assessment of metastasis in studies of the effects of dietary fat on tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90245414\r", 
  ".W": "It is clear that the DNA content of endocrine cells is influenced by factors other than neoplastic change and transformation. Although it can be concluded that, in general, the DNA content of neoplasms is increased, it is less clear whether this increase in DNA content is the cause or the effect of neoplastic transformation. The actual consequences of an increased DNA content are still largely unknown. However, based on a substantial body of data on the measure of nuclear DNA content in thyroid neoplasms, several conclusions appear to be reasonable. First, the measurement of nuclear DNA content and ploidy analysis are not sufficiently reliable parameters upon which to distinguish a benign from a malignant thyroid neoplasm. Therefore, this parameter has failed to live up to the expectation that it would be a powerful diagnostic tool. Second, the measurement of nuclear DNA content is useful after a histomorphologic diagnosis has been made since it correlates very well with the prognosis and clinical outcome of the patient. It is clear that aneuploid thyroid carcinomas are responsible for earlier recurrence, an increased likelihood of distant and diffuse metastases, and an increased incidence of death compared with diploid thyroid carcinomas. Except for the rare occasion, diploidy implies a uniformly long-term survival whereas aneuploidy is associated with a variable clinical course. Irrespective of histomorphology, lethal lesions of the thyroid are invariably aneuploid, whereas lesions associated with prolonged survival or a favorable outcome can be either diploid or aneuploid. Aneuploidy in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is more likely in older patients, in less well-differentiated neoplasms, and in neoplasms infiltrating beyond the thyroid capsule. Age, type of neoplasm, extrathyroidal extension, and recurrent disease all appear to be more important prognostic variables than is nuclear DNA content. However, nuclear DNA content can increase the prognostic power of these variables and consequently may come to be increasingly useful in the management of some patients with thyroid neoplasms. After a histomorphologic diagnosis has been made, the measurement of nuclear DNA content and a determination of the DNA ploidy may have significant prognostic value.\r"

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is regarded by some as a premalignant lesion for which thyroidectomy is definitely indicated. In contrast, other investigators have found no increased evidence of thyroid carcinoma in patients with this disease. As a result, the management of thyroid nodules in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis remains highly individualized. A program for the management of patients with chronic Hashimoto's thyroiditis with co-existing neoplasia or primary hyperparathyroidism is outlined.\r"

There were 147 patients enrolled in the study; 75 received AZ and ampicillin (AMP) and 72 amikacin (AM) and AMP (conventional therapy). Twenty-eight AZ/AMP-treated patients and 32 conventionally treated patients had bacteriologically documented infections caused by gram-negative enteric bacilli or Pseudomonas species. Treatment groups were comparable in age, clinical status, and type and severity of underlying disease at the time of enrollment. Bronchopneumonia and infections caused by Pseudomonas species occurred significantly more often in AM/AMP-treated patients compared with patients given AZ/AMP. Sepsis was documented in 83% of patients in each treatment group and Gram-negative enteric bacilli and Pseudomonas species were the principal pathogens. Median peak serum bactericidal titers against the etiologic agent were 1:64 for the AZ/AMP and 1:16 for AM/AMP-treated patients. Case fatality rates resulting from the primary infection were 7 and 22% (P = 0.011), superinfection occurred in 39% and 34% and treatment failure occurred in 7 and 28% (P = 0.036) of the AZ/AMP and AM/AMP-treated patients, respectively. No clinical adverse reactions were observed in either group. Based on these results aztreonam appears to be at least as effective as and possibly more effective than amikacin when used initially with ampicillin for empiric treatment of neonatal bacterial infections.\r"

No one laboratory test or radiograph meets all of the preceding criteria. Great strides have been made, however, in the early diagnosis of cancer. For example, breast cancer is being diagnosed at much earlier stages because of mammography. Just a few years ago, safety was a major issue because of the high level of radiation exposure connected with mammography. Today, radiation exposure is minimal, and the benefits far outweigh the potential harm. Research must continue to perfect the existing screening tools and develop new tools that will enable the early detection of malignant disease.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation therapy is one of the oldest treatments available for cancer management. Since the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity in the 1890s, patients have been treated with radiation. Advances in equipment and in the understanding of radiobiology permit delivery of effective doses of radiation to tumors while minimizing normal tissue damage. Recent advances in radiation have expanded the scope of treatment. Large-field, large-dose radiation, such as half-body treatment, permits treatment of metastatic disease in an effective and well-tolerated manner in patients too ill to travel for therapy. Total skin electron therapy has been successful in managing extensive skin disease. Hyperfractionated treatment is an experimental approach that attempts to achieve better tumor control by treating with two fractions per day. Intraoperative radiation is a conceptually sound but logistically cumbersome plan in which treatment is given in a single fraction at the time of surgery. Its full potential may be realized when the technical difficulties of administration can be overcome. Brachytherapy is the use of radioactive sources implanted directly into the tumor or in a cavity in proximity to the tumor. Techniques have improved in both surgery and radiation, which allow previously inaccessible sites such as the brain to be implanted. Early-stage breast cancer has been effectively managed with lumpectomy followed by radiation. Hyperthermia is the use of heat in conjunction with radiation. Heat has been found to enhance the effect of radiation and limit the repair of radiation damage. The properties of heat cause it to be more damaging to tumor cells than to normal ones. The ability to sensitize cancer cells to radiation and protect normal cells from radiation has been an ongoing research objective. Clinical trials are in progress to isolate effective, easily administered, and nontoxic compounds. The nurse caring for the patient receiving radiation must have an understanding of how radiation works and what the treatment goals are for the patient. Radiation is a difficult modality for patients to understand. Many fears and concerns are based on this lack of comprehension. The nurse must be prepared to describe the experience of receiving radiation and assist patients to anticipate and manage side effects. Patients need to know what to expect from therapy in terms they can understand. Recent advances and experimental treatments should be explained in terms of what is known including the rationale for the procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Regardless of the care setting, the nurse remains in a pivotal position to facilitate the optimal management of symptoms. Tremendous opportunities exist for nurses to collaborate across a variety of settings in order to ensure continuity. Such continuity enhances patient care but most important assures individuals (and their significant others) that their history is known and that they do not have to fear poor emetic control because of caregiver ignorance. The ability to initiate or support behavioral interventions demonstrates the nurse's commitment to holistic care. Such holism is the foundation and reward of cancer nursing practice.\r"

ARC and AHA instructional materials that advocate use of these methods have not been recalled, and the public has not been warned of the dangers. One cause of the confusion about backslaps is the flawed belief that gas pressure alone removes a foreign body. In addition, there is lack of understanding that, compared with the Heimlich maneuver, the backslap produces an insignificant amount of the energy required to expel an object from the airway. In fact, the energy produced by the backslap drives the foreign object in the wrong direction, toward the lungs, while the energy produced by the Heimlich maneuver drives the object away from the lungs, toward the mouth. Backslaps and chest thrusts should be publicly recalled as a treatment for choking infants before further deaths and injuries occur. The Heimlich maneuver is the best rescue technique for treating choking victims of all ages.\r"

A review of the outcomes of prenatal uropathology serves as a basis on which to interpret reports of prenatal intervention for hydronephrosis. A critical review of the experience of prenatal intervention is conditionally supportive of its benefits, but this view must be tempered by a recognition of the inherent risk to the mother and fetus. Included within this view is a recognition that not all hydronephrosis is caused by obstruction. More specific prognostic indicators of renal and pulmonary functional reserve are critically needed to permit appropriate patient selection. This must be coupled with more rigorous assessment of outcomes and complete reporting of the results. Continued basic and clinical research is important in developing these data. A management strategy for hydronephrosis in the prenatal and postnatal periods is presented, based on the goal of permitting maximal renal as well as pulmonary development in utero and in the newborn period.\r"

Fractional excretion studies are less sensitive than concentrating ability in indicating dysfunction. Associated pyelonephritis hastens renal damage and exacerbates any functional abnormality. Renal functional abnormalities are more common in patients with renal scarring and indeed may be predictive of a process that is not yet apparent pathologically.\r"

Neonatal azotemia and severe bilateral reflux are particularly important negative prognostic factors. In the mild cases, valve ablation with or without delayed reconstruction is good therapy. In the very severe cases, our interpretation of all the clinical and experimental information now available suggests that the time interval and the level of decompression are extremely important. Achievement of consistent low caliceal pressure without stasis and infections should be achieved as soon as possible. We do not agree with the philosophy of \"valve ablation and wait and see\" for secondary reconstruction as applied to the severe cases. An analogous philosophy would be treating all respiratory infections as upper respiratory infections and applying aggressive appropriate therapy for pneumonia only if the patient does not respond clinically. However, all controversy aside, the management of neonatal infants with posterior urethral valves remains a difficult and challenging problem for us all. The real challenge will be to improve published management results to the point that the family faced with decisions regarding an in utero diagnosis of posterior urethral valves will have enough hope to continue the pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The obstruction caused by posterior urethral valves may be responsible for profound dysfunction of the entire proximal urinary tract. The pathophysiologic relations between the valves and function of the ureterovesical junction and upper urinary tract are key in determining the need for upper tract surgery. In most cases, function of the ureters and ureterovesical junction is directly related to high intravesical pressure and will normalize when pressures drop after valve destruction. However, upper tract function remains abnormal in some cases and leads to complications that necessitate early ureteral and upper tract surgical intervention. The second crucial relation in the management of patients with posterior urethral valves is that between renal dysfunction and urinary tract obstruction. The surgeon is compelled to maximize the potential for renal function. The relation between renal dysplasia, obstructive uropathy, and urinary tract obstruction complicates the management of patients with posterior urethral valves and challenges us to develop new methods to measure potential renal function. Patients born with posterior urethral valves are treated initially with bladder drainage, which is undertaken by placement of a urethral catheter at the time diagnosis is made with the voiding cystogram. During this initial period of evaluation and stabilization, the patient's medical status is optimized, giving the surgeon information concerning renal function and prognosis to allow the most efficient surgical management. In almost all cases, posterior urethral valves are destroyed primarily, most often by transurethral fulguration. This usually leads to rapid improvement of bladder, upper tract, and renal function. When primary fulguration is not advisable, drainage through a vesicostomy is a useful alternative. Utilizing either method, low-pressure bladder drainage is a primary goal in the initial management of patients in most centers. As with many problems in surgery, our ability to accurately identify patients who would benefit from surgery is more limited than our surgical effectiveness. Voiding cystograms allow us to diagnose reflux and to follow bladder emptying and function. Serial ultrasound scans, nuclear medicine scans, and pressure-perfusion studies give us insight into upper urinary tract function. Too often, however, limitations of the patient's condition and size and the severe degree of urinary tract abnormalities make the results difficult to interpret. Although diagnostic tests are invaluable in making decisions about upper tract surgery in patients with posterior urethral valves, these decisions are most often based on the classic clinical urologic problems of urinary extravasation, obstruction, infection, reflux, and azotemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The child with neurogenic bladder dysfunction may suffer from lower urinary tract obstruction, which, if untreated, can result in upper urinary tract deterioration. It is prudent to identify those newborns and infants who are at risk for upper urinary tract deterioration and advise an appropriate treatment protocol. In order to identify those children at risk, a thorough examination is required, along with appropriate upper urinary tract imaging studies and urodynamic assessment of the bladder. Infants and children at risk for upper tract deterioration are those who have intermittent or continuous detrusor pressure elevation above 40 cm H2O. We have identified the safe period, which is the time during which the bladder remains at a pressure lower than 40 cm H2O. Our management protocol for each child is individualized and based on increasing the safe period. The safe period can be increased with a combination of intermittent catheterization, administration of medications, and, in some cases, surgical reconstruction. With compulsive evaluation and intensive management, many of the previous upper urinary tract changes associated with the obstructed neurogenic bladder can be averted. With the above factors in mind, we have defined the period of bladder filling and storage where the pressure is below 40 cm H2O as the safe period. The ideal bladder for maintenance of normal upper tracts would have a long safe period and low voiding pressure. Our treatment protocol for the neurogenic bladder is therefore dependent on identifying those children who have very short or nonexistent safe periods. These are the children who are at risk for upper tract deterioration.\r"

Whether these factors are best controlled by medical treatment or by surgical correction has been the source of some controversy. Although medical treatment may have improved over the years, so have the results of reconstructive surgery. Because the syndrome is a spectrum disorder, there will certainly be many patients who require little or no surgical intervention. The majority, however, will benefit from carefully planned and well-executed reconstructive surgery. Even in these cases, there should be a period of medical treatment and surveillance with interval re-evaluation. In a few patients, early stabilization will not be possible, and a drainage procedure such as vesicostomy will be necessary in the first days of life. Regardless of how an individual patient might be treated, he will require long-term follow-up surveillance. As more long-term results are reported, the optimal treatment plan should become more obvious.\r"

The limited human experience provides insufficient data to confirm this hypothesis but has demonstrated the technical feasibility of prenatal interventions. There is a critical need for further refinement in understanding the complex pathophysiology of congenital obstructive uropathy, not only the renal consequences, but also the pulmonary and systemic effects. There remains the particular need to resolve the determinants and indicators of functional salvageability of the kidneys and lungs in congenital obstructive uropathy.\r"

Transrectal ultrasound evaluation was available only for three quarters of the patients in the latter group. In the early part of the series, standard prostatectomy revealed 51 percent of the patients to have organ-confined disease and in the latter series 75 percent had organ-confined disease. In the earlier study only a retrospective analysis of the pathology reports was available, and in the latter study prospective evaluation was available with regard to pre- and postoperative staging, erectile function, blood loss and replacement, PSA data, and clinical and pathologic staging. It appears the radical nerve-sparing prostatectomy has several advantages including decreased blood loss, increased reservation of erectile function in 70 percent of the patients who were potent preoperatively, and a more accurate assessment of clinical stage prior to surgery through the use of transrectal ultrasonography.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients with Stage IV renal cell carcinoma were treated with autolymphocyte therapy (ALT). This new form of adoptive immunotherapy is based on the infusion of relatively small numbers of autologous lymphocytes that are depleted of suppressor cells and immunized in vitro by a method designed for antigen-specific activation using a 3M KCl extract of autologous tumor and an autologous lymphokine mixture. Patients received six monthly infusions of immunized lymphocytes, all on an outpatient basis. The majority of patients experienced no toxicity. The few reactions that occurred were minor and self-limiting; none required any medical intervention or subsequent delay in therapy. Patients also received oral cimetidine to reduce in vivo suppressor cell function. Survival at twenty-four months is 36 percent. Median survival is fifteen months, a significant improvement over the natural history of this disease. A multi-site, randomized, controlled trial of ALT in renal cell carcinoma has been initiated to confirm that this treatment causes a significant prolongation of survival with virtually no toxicity in these patients.\r"

The histologic features at the early stage of acute pyelonephritis and the pathways of bacterial invasion and distribution in the infected kidneys were studied by using transmission electron microscope. The histologic changes were characterized by degeneration and destruction of renal pelvic and tubular epithelial cells, and a massive infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Bacteria invaded the pelvic surface and spread over the renal medulla and cortex by contiguity twelve hours after infection. It was also shown that bacteria ascended the tubules, multiplied in the tubular lumina, destroyed the tubular epithelial cells, and spread over the renal cortex by twelve hours. In addition, bacteria and leukocytes phagocytizing bacteria were present in the capillaries in the renal interstitium twelve hours after infection.\r"

Severe fetal hydronephrosis with calicectasis or parenchymal thinning rarely resolves spontaneously before or after birth. We also reviewed the clinical and experimental literature on renal hypertrophy. After unilateral nephrectomy in neonatal animals or after birth with congenital absence of one kidney in humans, the remaining kidney hypertrophies very quickly. In infants and young animals, the eventual size of the remaining kidney is inversely proportional to the age at which one kidney is lost. This improvement in residual renal function seen after renal loss in infancy, compared with older children, itself constitutes a strong argument for early relief of obstruction. If contralateral renal hypertrophy has occurred, the treated damaged kidney may resume growth in parallel with its hypertrophied mate but does not become as large or recover normal potential for growth. In other words, if correction of a unilateral obstruction is deferred until contralateral hypertrophy occurs, the obstructed kidney then has less potential for recovery of function.\r"

  ".W": "Although acute afterload reduction is known to improve cardiac output in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), the effect of therapy on the atrial overload directly causing congestive symptoms has not been systematically studied. Atrial volumes and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, in addition to left ventricular ejection fraction and indexes of left ventricular contractility (mean acceleration, ejection time and peak systolic pressure/end-systolic volume index), were measured using 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography and color flow imaging in 30 patients with advanced CHF, before and after acute vasodilator and diuretic therapy tailored to hemodynamic goals. Therapy increased stroke volume by 64% (36 +/- 10 to 55 +/- 14 cc), decreased right atrial pressure by 45% (15 +/- 5 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg), systemic vascular resistance by 36% (1,700 +/- 400 to 1,030 +/- 300 dynes s cm-5) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 37% (31 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg) (all p less than 0.001). Echocardiography showed simultaneous reductions in left and right atrial volumes: 24 +/- 19 and 18 +/- 12%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation measured by color flow fraction both decreased by a mean of 44% (p less than 0.001). While ejection fraction increased from 15 +/- 5 to 19 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001), there were no changes in relatively load-independent indexes of contractility. Therefore, acute therapy with vasodilators and diuretics in advanced CHF causes reductions in atrial volumes and atrioventricular valve regurgitation that are evident from serial noninvasive studies and may play a major role in the improvement of congestive symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Several experimental in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that structurally diverse converting enzyme inhibitors improve contractile dysfunction, as well as reduce arrhythmia production and acute mortality after occlusion of the coronary artery. Biochemical data have demonstrated that some inhibitors of converting enzyme bind better to cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) than others; however, there has not been any demonstrated correlation between inhibition of the enzyme and improvement in cardiac physiology in the acutely dysfunctioning stunned myocardium. It is assumed that ACE inhibitors reduce tissue generation of angiotensin II; however, this relationship as well as peptide levels in coronary venous effluent need to be specifically measured. The multiple substrates of ACE necessitate further work to explore the role of bradykinin and prostacyclin, which have been implicated by some workers as contributing to the beneficial action of ACE inhibitors. A new question is whether sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitors are scavengers of toxic free radicals. Captopril, e.g., has been shown to be a free radical scavenger in superoxide-generating systems. Further work is required; however, as one report has recently shown, captopril does not directly scavenge superoxide but acts indirectly as an antioxidant or by altering the concentration of cytochrome c.\r"

The concept that early reperfusion may salvage jeopardized myocardium is derived from basic experimental studies which purported to demonstrate that the ultimate extent of irreversible myocardial injury could be reduced by reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium within 3 hours from the onset of regional myocardial ischemia. It is firmly established that salvage of ischemic myocardium is dependent on early restoration of blood flow to the myocardium at risk. Despite dependency on reoxygenation for ultimate survival, myocardial tissue that is reperfused and reoxygenated may be subjected to additional injurious insult due to reactive metabolites of oxygen. The cytotoxic species of oxygen are referred to as \"oxygen free radicals.\" Coincident with the influx of inflammatory cells into the reperfused region is an additional loss of otherwise viable myocardial cells. There is strong support for the concept that the polymorphonuclear leukocyte is a contributor to the phenomenon of \"reperfusion\" or \"reoxygenation\" injury in the blood perfused heart. This discussion focuses on the role of the neutrophil as a potential contributor to the extension of tissue injury and reviews those interventions, which although in the experimental stage, offer promise of becoming therapeutically important in the future and may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potentially deleterious role of the neutrophil in situations involving whole blood reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of captopril and enalaprilat, 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, to scavenge superoxide anion radical was examined. With use of a number of superoxide-generating systems, such as xanthine-xanthine oxidase, phorbol myristate acetate-activated neutrophils, auto-oxidizing dihydroxyfumarate, and auto-oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome, captopril was seen not to scavenge superoxide directly, because it did not inhibit superoxide-dependent cytochrome c or nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction. Superoxide-dependent cytochrome c reduction was inhibited only when captopril was preincubated with a lower concentration of cytochrome c (22 microM). This effect was due to a decrease in the concentration of cytochrome c, because captopril reduced cytochrome c directly. When this effect was compensated for, no cytochrome c reduction induced by superoxide was observed. Captopril inhibited the auto-oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome at pH 10.2 where this auto-oxidation is superoxide-dependent, and at pH 7.8 where it is superoxide-independent and superoxide dismutase insensitive. It appears that captopril, in this respect, acted as a nonspecific antioxidant, probably by reducing an intermediate in the complex oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome. Therefore, caution may be used in interpreting the role of captopril in the attenuation of reperfusion-induced myocardial dysfunction and in attributing this effect to the inhibition of free radical mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of independently functioning local renin-angiotensin systems in a number of tissues has been firmly established by biochemical and functional evidence and, most recently, by the demonstration of genetic messages for components of the renin-angiotensin systems, such as renin and angiotensinogen, in several organs. In this review, local renin-angiotensin systems in the heart and vascular walls are described and the contribution of a local inhibition of converting enzymes to the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme inhibitors is discussed. Most of the studies cited support the hypothesis that an inhibition of cardiac converting enzyme may be involved in the beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic actions of converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension and congestive heart failure, independent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system. Local effects on cardiac converting enzyme may contribute to the ability of converting enzyme inhibitors to reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Similarly, local converting enzyme inhibition in the vascular wall may not only constitute a mechanism involved in the antihypertensive effects of converting enzyme inhibitors, but may also contribute to the regression of hypertension-induced vascular hypertrophy. In addition to reduced local angiotensin II generation, converting enzyme inhibition may engender a potentiation of the local effects of kinins. This mechanism may be more important to the cardiovascular actions of converting enzyme inhibitors than initially thought.\r"

Conversely, some therapies that have benefited the patient with heart failure may benefit the patient who has had a myocardial infarction.

  ".U": "90247323\r", 
  ".W": "The most effective way to protect injured myocardium during the early phases of evolving myocardial infarction is with reperfusion. However, reperfusion may induce further myocardial injury. Alterations in the major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, including increases in heart rate, contractile state and myocardial wall tension may also increase infarct size. An understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the evolution of myocardial injury during myocardial infarction is important to the development of protective strategies that may reduce infarct size or attenuate reperfusion-induced myocardial injury, or both. Selective calcium antagonists, beta blockers, and phospholipase antagonists or inhibitors may reduce infarct size in association with early reperfusion. Reperfusion injury may be attenuated by free radical scavengers and calcium antagonists. Reinfarction, after the initial event, may ultimately be reduced in frequency by pharmacologic strategies that interfere with platelet adhesion, aggregation, and mediator release from activated platelets and white cells that promote further platelet aggregation or induce coronary artery vasoconstriction. Included among protective strategies are thromboxane receptor antagonists and synthesis inhibitors, serotonin receptor antagonists, possibly leukotriene synthesis inhibitors or receptor antagonists, and aspirin. Future clinical trials should test the combined efficacy of reperfusion and selected pharmacologic strategies that alter calcium accumulation in the injured myocardium, diminish the injurious effects of beta- and alpha-adrenergic mechanisms and oxygen-derived free radicals on injured myocytes, and prevent reocclusion mediated by platelets and platelet mediators.\r"

  ".W": "The extent and severity of myocardial dysfunction and risk of dying are associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there is a dissociation between the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and the prevalence of sudden death among patients with congestive heart failure. Sudden death occurs in 8 to 10% of New York Heart Association functional class I patients and in 20% of class II, III and IV patients, despite increased frequency of malignant arrhythmias and functional deterioration. Yearly mortality rates increase from 12 to 15% in class I and II and is 60% in class IV. Sudden death in class I and II is 50 to 60% of all deaths, whereas in class IV it amounts to only 20 to 30%. The most important cause of death in class IV is progressive congestive heart failure. Ventricular arrhythmia is a trigger event in the development of fatal arrhythmia which depends on a substrate of myocardial scar tissue, hypertrophy and aberrant conducting pathways. However, regional myocardial ischemia, transmembrane electrolyte differences and myocardial stores of catecholamines are important modulators. Depletion of myocardial catecholamines and down-regulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium may explain tolerance to ventricular tachyarrhythmias observed in patients with severe congestive heart failure and intolerance to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may reduce ventricular arrhythmias, the important role of ACE inhibitors in severe congestive heart failure is to prevent progression of myocardial dysfunction and congestive heart failure. To date, however, ACE inhibitors have not been demonstrated to have a significant effect on the incidence of sudden death. This does not preclude an effect on fatal arrhythmias among patients with milder heart failure and intact stores of myocardial catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "Nephron loss is a common progression of a diverse range of kidney diseases. Recent experimental models of chronic renal disease have suggested that hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms play key roles in progressive renal injury. Extensive renal ablation in the rat was followed by development of altered glomerular hemodynamics. Albuminuria and histologic damage leading to focal glomerulosclerosis were preceded by the development of increased glomerular pressures and were prevented by interventions such as severe dietary protein restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Both experimental interventions ameliorated glomerular hypertension. It was therefore concluded that these interventions ameliorated injury by glomerular hemodynamic effect. Similar findings were obtained in a rat model of type I diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin in which glomerular hemodynamic factors appeared important to the development of progressive renal disease. Recent studies have suggested that nonhemodynamic factors have important roles in the progression of glomerular injury. For example, although the predominant effects of ACE inhibitor therapy appear to be hemodynamically mediated, data are emerging which suggest that these agents may also influence growth/proliferation of glomerular cells. Because hyperplasia/hypertrophy may influence glomerular susceptibility to injury, this may also be a potential mechanism whereby ACE inhibitor therapy influences glomerular damage. In addition, a variety of studies have suggested that hyperlipidemia, which is frequent accompaniment of glomerular disease, is an important modulator of glomerular injury independent of glomerular hemodynamic effects. Coagulation factors, calcium phosphorus balance, as well as the genetic susceptibility of the glomerulus to injury, all appear to contribute to progressive nephron destruction.\r"

Acute viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, refractory coagulopathy, Child's class C cirrhosis, and emergent surgery are major risk factors predictive of a poor outcome.

One hundred healthy and asymptomatic volunteers collected stool samples after 2-wk courses of both oral iron (either ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) and placebo, while following strict medicinal, dietary, and collection instructions. Each sample was tested by both the Hemoccult II and Hemoccult Sensa methods. Of the participants who completed this study (n = 78), there were no positive results for occult blood after iron ingestion when tested by either method. Only one participant displayed a positive result while taking the placebo, with this specimen considered contaminated by unexpected menses. From these findings, it can be concluded that oral iron supplementation does not cause false-positive results when the Hemoccult II or Hemoccult Sensa method is used for fecal occult blood testing.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Genital warts are a highly prevalent and chronic sexually transmitted disease for which there is no completely satisfactory therapy. Conventional ablative therapy requires repeated treatment, often for months or years. This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.5% podofilox in patient-administered treatment of penile warts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight men with penile warts were randomly assigned to double-blind, self-administration of 0.5% podofilox solution or placebo, twice daily for 3 days per week for 4 weeks. Eleven podofilox and 15 placebo recipients with residual warts then received an additional 4 weeks of open-label treatment. RESULTS: By the end of treatment, podofilox recipients had their mean wart number and area reduced to 15.9% and 5.1% of baseline values, compared to 97.4% and 92.9% in the placebo group (p = 0.0001). Local adverse reactions were more common in the podofilox group, but were transient. Complete disappearance of warts was observed in 25 (53.3%) of 45 treatment courses, including open-label treatment. Recurrences of warts after therapy were frequent. Only 21% of patients remained free of warts 2 weeks after completing treatment, and subsequent recurrences were noted in all patients available for long-term follow-up, which is a common limitation of ablative therapy for genital warts. CONCLUSION: Podofilox 0.5% solution is effective in treating penile warts and is well tolerated in a self-administered regimen. Podofilox 0.5% offers potential advantages in safety and cost over podophyllin resin therapy of genital warts.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The presence of immunoglobulins and complement in sarcoid granulomata and bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with sarcoidosis suggests that humoral mechanisms may be of importance in granuloma formation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the possibility that antibodies to specific tissue carbohydrates causing alterations and/or dysfunction of immunocompetent cells might be present during sarcoidosis. Because we had previously shown the presence of sialidase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage from these patients, we have looked for the presence of antibodies that recognize sialidase-treated erythrocytes (mostly antigalactose) in the serum of patients with sarcoidosis. Since thymocytes are spontaneously recognized by peanut agglutinin, a lectin that binds galactose, the reactivity of serum from sarcoidosis patients with normal or neuraminidase-treated thymocytes has also been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from the venous blood of patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis, most of whom had no extrathoracic symptoms. The mean patient age was 31 years, with a range from 21 to 57 years. There were 12 women and 19 men, and 10% of the patients were smokers. Sarcoidosis was classified as recent if symptoms had been present for less than 1 year and chronic if symptoms had been present for longer than this. Control serum samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 9) and from healthy volunteers (n = 15). Furthermore, serum from patients who had previously had sarcoidosis but in whom cures had been achieved was also studied (n = 6). RESULTS: Sialidase-treated erythrocytes were lysed in autologous serum upon incubation at 37 degrees C providing that the serum came from a patient with active disease. Serum from either normal volunteers or patients with resolved sarcoidosis had no significant cytotoxic activity. Lysis proceeded through activation of the classical complement pathway following fixation of autoantibodies. These antibodies were predominantly of the IgM class. They were able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated thymocytes, whereas untreated thymocytes did not fix the antibodies. Carbohydrate inhibition experiments demonstrated that these antibodies are mostly galactose specific. As this sugar is located immediately below the sialic acid residues in the carbohydrate moiety of membrane glycoconjugates, it is unmasked following sialidase treatment. CONCLUSION: Since galactose has been shown to be present on the membrane of certain subsets of immunocompetent cells (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages either spontaneously or after stimulation), it is possible that antigalactose antibodies may affect the metabolism of these cells, leading to some of the immune dysfunctions that are observed during sarcoidosis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to report 13 cases and review the literature for pyarthrosis occurring in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Special emphasis is placed on evaluating both the changing, as well as the constant, features of this complication and on assessing diagnostic and therapeutic aspects that have a bearing upon outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of records from our institution revealed 13 cases of pyarthrosis in patients with RA over the past 14 years. Information obtained included patient demographics, RA history, concomitant illnesses and medications, length of symptoms prior to the diagnosis of pyarthrosis, peri-articular manifestations, probable source of infection, joint(s) involved, relevant laboratory data, and information on treatment and outcome based on initial surgical therapy versus closed needle drainage. In addition, 213 cases from 45 citations were reviewed for similar information. RESULTS: Our series was notable for a high percentage of associated serious medical illnesses and peri-articular manifestations of the pyarthrosis (i.e., sinus tract formation, concomitant septic bursitis, or infected synovial cyst). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was a useful monitor of adequate therapy and was often a signal of recurrent infection. In all patients, the skin was the major source of infection. The mortality from pyarthrosis has declined over the past 40 years but is still unacceptably high, especially in patients with polyarticular involvement. Preliminary observations suggest that an initial surgical approach to joint drainage may be preferable to closed needle drainage in order to improve joint outcome in patients with RA and pyarthrosis. CONCLUSION: Pyarthrosis occurring in patients with RA continues to produce unacceptable morbidity and mortality despite 40 years' experience. Earlier recognition (which may include peri-articular features) and perhaps an aggressive surgical approach to drainage may improve the prognosis.\r"

Including our five cases, 195 patients with pill-induced damage and 39 patients with pill-induced strictures have been reported to date. Seventy-eight percent of the strictures were located in the proximal or mid-esophagus. Potassium chloride or quinidine preparations were incriminated in 60% of cases and were more likely to produce stricture than other medications commonly associated with esophageal damage (e.g., tetracycline). Older age, male gender, left atrial enlargement, ingestion of sustained-release formulations, and prior esophageal structural abnormality were all more commonly present in the subset with strictures (p less than 0.05 for each), even after appropriately controlling for medication. A logistic regression analysis revealed that older age and ingestion of sustained-release formulations were the most significant independent factors associated with stricture development (p less than 0.0001 for each). These findings indicate that stricture formation from pill-induced esophageal damage is dependent upon host-related factors as well as the caustic nature of the pill.\r"

Intermittent oral and intravenous regimens and continuous intravenous infusion of the dideoxynucleoside, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT), have been shown to be beneficial in improving neuro-developmental function and growth velocity in pediatric patients with AIDS. AZT, however, is limited by the associated development of neutropenia and anemia, which frequently necessitates transfusions. Another dideoxynucleoside, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), also shows theoretical promise in the treatment of the pediatric AIDS population. This agent is not associated with the hematologic toxicity induced by AZT but does produce a painful sensory peripheral neuropathy. Sequential therapy with AZT and ddC may limit the toxic effects associated with the use of these drugs individually. Dideoxyinosine and soluble recombinant CD4 are two newer antiretroviral agents that are under investigation for the management of AIDS in infants and children. The activity of recombinant CD4 in preventing the transplacental transmission of human immunodeficiency virus is also being evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the number of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is likely to increase into the 1990s and perhaps beyond. Zidovudine, a 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside approved for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, provides immunologic, virologic, and survival benefits. However, because its hematologic toxicity can be dose-limiting, investigations are ongoing with other 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. After zidovudine, the first of these agents to be tested was 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), the most potent inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase among the dideoxynucleosides tested thus far. Concentrations of ddC as low as 0.5 microM provide protection against HIV in cultured T cells (and monocytes), even at high multiplicities of infection. Like the other dideoxynucleosides, activation of ddC is dependent on intracellular phosphorylation to its 5'-triphosphate form. Efforts are under way to alter enzymatically the intracellular ratio of ddC-5'-triphosphate to deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate, its endogenous counterpart. ddC has relatively straightforward pharmacokinetics; it has a plasma half-life of about 1.2 hours and an oral bioavailability of about 87 percent. Approximately 75 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Patients treated with ddC have experienced both immunologic and virologic benefit, although long-term high doses are limited by the development of painful peripheral neuropathy. Significant hematologic toxicity is not evident in most patients; low-dose regimens of ddC alone, as well as alternating or in combination with zidovudine, are being tested in an effort to retain antiviral activity while minimizing treatment toxicities.\r"

Both drugs, however, produce dose-limiting toxicities. AZT is associated with unacceptable levels of bone marrow suppression, and ddC can cause painful peripheral neuropathy. The different toxicity profiles of these two drugs provide the rationale for testing them in alternating dosing combinations in an attempt to retain the antiretroviral activity of each against human immunodeficiency virus, while reducing the toxicities of both. A preliminary trial showed that 200 mg AZT given orally every four hours for seven-day periods, alternating with ddC at 0.03 mg/kg body weight orally every four hours for seven-day periods is a promising treatment regimen. An expanded multicenter study is evaluating ddC at 0.01 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg alternating with AZT at 200 mg in weekly or monthly periods. Weekly intermittent doses of AZT at 200 mg and ddC at 0.03 mg/kg are also being tested. The rationale and methods of the trial are discussed.\r"

One approach involves alternating administration of AZT and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. 2',3'-Dideoxycytidine is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and in vivo. Although it does not cause clinically significant bone marrow suppression, its usefulness at high continuous doses is limited by the occurrence of painful peripheral neuropathy. Because the toxicities of these nucleosides are non-overlapping, intermittent or alternating schedules may limit the toxicity of each agent while extending active antiretroviral therapy in these patients. In an ongoing study, patients have been randomly assigned to weekly intermittent, weekly alternating, and monthly alternating regimens of AZT and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. The study will determine the best-tolerated regimen and provide insights into the use of toxic nucleoside analogues in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease.\r"

  ".W": "The dideoxynucleosides 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) are potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro and improve surrogate measures of HIV infection in vivo. Long-term administration of AZT has been associated with significant hematologic toxicity and has resulted in virus with reduced in vitro susceptibility. Although ddC does not have significant hematologic toxicity and has not shown cross-resistance with AZT in vitro, ddC has been associated with a severe dose-related peripheral neuropathy. Given the independent activity of each agent, their non-overlapping toxicity profiles, and the absence of cross-resistance, it was hypothesized that concurrent administration of AZT and ddC in low doses might be at least as active as either drug given individually at higher doses in the treatment of HIV infection. It was further hypothesized that combined low doses of both drugs would reduce the incidence of serious side effects and the development of resistance. A phase I/II dose-finding trial of six different regimens of combination AZT and ddC in persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex was initiated to test these hypotheses.\r"

  ".W": "The reverse transcriptase inhibitor 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) is capable of mediating virologic and immunologic improvements in some patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex. However, severe peripheral neuropathy often develops as a dose-limiting toxicity in ddC-treated patients. Lower doses of ddC may avoid this side effect, while retaining antiviral activity associated with this drug. A series of clinical trials is currently examining regimens employing simultaneous or alternating administration of ddC and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine). Concurrent therapy with more than one drug may allow the use of decreased drug doses and thus reduce dose-dependent toxicities, whereas alternating schedules would provide rest periods from each drug without interrupting therapy. Since zidovudine and ddC possess different toxicity profiles and zidovudine-resistant strains remain susceptible to ddC in vitro, such regimens could theoretically provide additional benefits and reduced toxicity, compared with either agent administered alone. It is hoped that these ongoing and future studies will uncover new and better ways to exploit the therapeutic potential of ddC. However, at present, ddC is an experimental drug and should not be used outside the setting of an approved clinical protocol.\r"

  ".W": "The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3'-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3'-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3'-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The delivery of insulin and the insulin receptor into an intracellular compartment may be important for eliciting some of the biologic responses of the cell to the hormone. Internalization of insulin-receptor complexes in cells from hyperinsulinemic type II diabetic patients is diminished, suggesting a possible role for this cellular process in insulin resistance. To examine whether hyperinsulinemia contributes to defective insulin-receptor processing in vitro, cultured hepatoma cells (HepG2) were incubated with high concentrations of (500 ng/ml) insulin from 1-3 days. Insulin induced a decrease in the number of total and surface insulin receptors within 24 hours; however, the hormone did not mediate a change in the number of intracellular receptors. The cellular itinerary of control and down-regulated receptors were then compared. Insulin mediated internalization of down-regulated receptors was impaired compared to control receptors; however, the down-regulated receptors that were internalized recycled back to the plasma membrane more efficiently. By covalently labeling the insulin receptor with the photoactive insulin derivative, 125I-NAPA-DP-insulin, it was demonstrated that the rates of receptor degradation of down-regulated and control receptors were similar. These results suggest that incubating HepG2 cells with high concentrations of insulin alters the cellular itinerary of the insulin receptor.\r"

Ancrod cleaves fibrinogen; the resulting circulating ancrod-fibrin stimulates fibrinolysis. Ancrod action and effect were studied in 20 patients with acute developing stroke in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, and received either normal saline or ancrod 0.5 mu/kg in normal saline administered as a constant-rate intravenous infusion over 6 hours. Subsequent doses of ancrod (or saline placebo) were determined daily thereafter for a total treatment period of 7 days. Neither bleeding nor re-thrombosis occurred within the 90 day follow-up period. That ancrod acted rapidly was shown by a significant decrease in functional plasminogen activator inhibitor (PA-I) within 60 minutes, and by significant elevations of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer within 3 and 4 hours. The biological effect of fibrinolysis in ancrod infused patients was demonstrated by a greater improvement in stroke score when compared to those infused with saline.\r"

Several examples of the clinical applications of these methods are discussed in Table 4. Southern analysis has been recently used: (1) to facilitate prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell hemoglobinopathies, (2) to demonstrate human papillomavirus DNA integration in the genome of cervical cancer cells and (3) to demonstrate that oncogene amplification in the tumors of patients with node positive breast cancer correlates inversely with prognosis. Each of these examples not only have diagnostic value for patient care but also may help begin to understand the very basis of the disease processes themselves.\r"

This was reduced to 2 litres/minute after a 10-minute period of nitrogen wash out and stabilisation of anaesthetic gas concentration, with an initial anaesthetic gas flow of 6 litres/minute. The concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and enflurane were measured in the outflow from both the anaesthetic machine and the inspiratory limb of the circle system. The measured mean inspired oxygen and nitrous oxide concentrations showed no significant variation throughout the low flow period of the study. This new low flow open circle ventilation system appears to offer some advantages in terms of safety and versatility over other systems which are discussed.\r"

Patients who received propofol underwent extubation of the trachea, using standard criteria, after a mean time (log-transformed) of 7.6 minutes after sedation for approximately 17 hours. The corresponding time was 125 minutes in those given midazolam. There were significantly higher morphine requirements during sedation, and higher arterial carbon dioxide tensions 30 minutes after extubation of the trachea, in patients who received midazolam. Pharmacokinetic analysis in 20 patients showed that the elimination half-life of propofol was prolonged (470 minutes) and clearance was reduced (1.14 litres/minute) compared with subjects who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. The rapid clinical recovery was reflected in a rapid redistribution half-life (13.4 minutes), but this was also longer than the redistribution time of 2-4 minutes in other patients.\r"

In most children, the diagnosis of asthma can be made on the basis of history, physical examination, and simple investigations. Successful management of asthma is contingent upon both patient and parents having a clear understanding of the condition, the goals, and specific details of treatment. The majority of children with asthma can be managed by avoidance of provoking factors, and suppression of symptoms with drug therapy. Drug therapy should follow a logical scheme such that a child with mild, infrequent asthma attacks would receive intermittent bronchodilator therapy, whereas a child with severe chronic asthma would ultimately be treated with maintenance steroids. Response to therapy should be assessed by serial measurement of pulmonary function. Certain features peculiar to infantile asthma demand a modified approach to the management of asthma in this age group.\r"

This has spawned a broad interest in the area of immunotoxicology within the scientific community as well as certain concerns in the public sector regarding chemical-induced hypersensitivity and immunosuppression. The incidence of alleged human sensitization to chemicals has increased, in part, due to the fact that chemical companies are moving to larger and/or different markets. It has been estimated that 35 million Americans suffer from allergic disease of which 2% to 5% are from occupational exposure. Although there is not yet a clear understanding of dose-response relationships or disease predisposition, there are many well-defined examples (isocyanates, anhydrides) of chemical sensitizers in humans and experimental animals. Evidence that chemicals suppress immune responses in humans is considerably less well established, although there is a public perception that chemicals generally cause immunosuppression. This perception has been fueled by highly publicized legal cases (ie, W.R. Grace and Agent Orange) and scientific controversies within the academic and industrial communities (Aldicarb). As a consequence of public pressure, the regulatory agencies are considering immunotoxicity testing guidelines. At the present, however, there are limitations on adequate human methodology and data that allow the extrapolation of animal data to assess accurately human risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treatment was either intranasal budesonide 200 micrograms bid or matching placebo bid. Nasal symptoms were rated daily on a scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Safety was monitored by laboratory assessments (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis) as well as by rhinoscopy and recording of adverse events. Budesonide reduced the nasal symptoms as compared with baseline. The reduction was greater than in the placebo group and symptoms were improved significantly on budesonide treatment compared with placebo. Laboratory assessments demonstrated no differences between budesonide and placebo. Adverse responses to intranasal budesonide were few and minor, and compliance was high. Intranasal budesonide, 200 micrograms bid, thus appears to be efficacious, highly acceptable, and safe for the treatment of perennial rhinitis.\r"

The SD of the measurement inconsistency was 0.13 cm for length, 0.078 cm for depth, and 0.32 cm2 for area; the percentages of total variance caused by measurement inconsistency were 7.9, 9.5, and 7.5, respectively. There was a significant difference between right and left kidneys in length and depth for each independent variable. The left kidney increased more in length and less in depth than the right so that the areas remained similar as the scale of variable increased. Kidney depth and area in boys were significantly larger than in girls, both dimensions increasing at equal rates. Centile charts for each dependent variable by each independent variable were constructed by a non-parametric method.\r"

The TIME model is designed to be controlled by a professor in the classroom setting, and incorporates voice recognition technology and video dramatization to create a believable patient encounter. Under the auspices of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, where the Project originated in 1983, three medical schools participated in a field test of this \"high-tech\" model. Six faculty members made ten classroom presentations of two TIME simulations to 306 second-year medical students. The principal finding was that, in a group setting, a large majority of the students at all three schools became individually committed to the care and management of the simulated patient. They acted as if the patient's problems were real and left the session feeling as though they had interacted with an actual person. Therefore, in terms of simulating a real patient, the TIME patient-simulation model was validated, providing the basis for the development of new patient-centered methods to teach and test medical students in the classroom setting. The Project has been at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, where the model is being introduced into the existing curriculum, since 1988. It is currently being used as a part of the final examination for second-year students and in discussion-group settings for fourth-year students in the internal medicine clerkship. A field test is also under way using the TIME model to assess the clinical performance of third-year students.\r"

Only a minority of the programs (22%) had ever trained a foreign fellow, and of these only five of 11 were definitely able to do so in the future. Over half (52%) of the programs that had never trained a foreign fellow stated that they were not prepared to train a foreign physician. Although foreign family physicians are encouraged by the American Academy of Family Practice to come to the United States for fellowships, this study shows that it is extremely difficult for these physicians to find programs willing to act as host.\r"

  ".W": "In 14 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class 2-3) and sinus rhythm the carotid sinus baroreceptors were stimulated to induce a reflex mediated decrease of sympathetic efferent activity and a simultaneous increase in vagal tone. Five patients were in severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class 3) with raised plasma concentrations of noradrenaline at rest (2.99 (0.86) nmol/l (mean (SD)) and nine patients had less severe heart failure (class 2.2 (0.2)) and normal plasma concentrations of noradrenaline at rest. The haemodynamic responses during arterial baroreceptor stimulation were different in both groups. In all five patients with severe heart failure cardiac output increased whereas in the nine patients with less severe heart failure it was unchanged or decreased. The increase of cardiac output in the group with severe heart failure was solely the result of a significant increase of stroke volume index (by 9 (2) ml/m2). In the nine patients with less severe heart failure stroke volume remained unchanged but heart rate decreased significantly by 7 (2) beats/min during baroreceptor stimulation. These data show that an integrated change of autonomic activity consisting of a decrease in sympathetic tone and an increase in vagal activity leads to an increase of stroke volume in patients with severe heart failure and hence to haemodynamic improvement.\r"

Four hundred and eight healthy male Post Office workers were screened in an occupational survey. Sixty eight (16.5%) of these had values of factor VII coagulant activity greater than 1.0 SD above the age related mean. A randomised double-blind crossover study was undertaken to investigate the effect of a fixed daily minidose of warfarin (1 mg) on the high activities of factor VII in these men. Forty two agreed to enter the study and 40 completed it. Their mean factor VII coagulant activity before warfarin treatment was 135.9%. Treatment with a fixed minidose of warfarin significantly reduced factor VII coagulant activity to 124.6%; there was no change on placebo. The prothrombin time was also significantly prolonged on active treatment although all the results remained within the normal range. These findings suggested a fixed minidose warfarin regime might be useful in the primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease by reducing high activities of factor VII.\r"

The pattern of polypeptides was characteristic for the patient serum and individual sera identified similar polypeptides from all three substrates. All 17 sera recognized major polypeptides of either Mr 230,000 (11 sera) or Mr 180,000 (seven sera) under the denaturing conditions used for immunoblotting studies. Sera from 12 patients were also examined using an immunoprecipitation technique. Polypeptide(s) of Mr 230,000 were immunoprecipitated from extracts of SCaBER cells by 11 of these sera, despite immunoblotting patterns of Mr 180,000 (or less) for three of the 11 sera. None of the minor polypeptides recognized in immunoblotting studies were immunoprecipitated by these sera. Localization of antigens was determined by binding of sera to intact or permeabilized SCaBER cells in an ELISA. Sera which recognized the Mr 230,000 polypeptide under denaturing conditions also identified an intracellular epitope in SCaBER cells, while sera which identified the denatured Mr 180,000 polypeptide bound to a cell surface epitope. Two distinct major antigens are recognized by bullous pemphigoid sera. These both appear as molecules of Mr 230,000 under non-denaturing conditions, but only one of the molecules is dissociated to produce a Mr 180,000 polypeptide under denaturing conditions. Epitopes on these two major antigens are localized on either side of the cell membrane.\r"

Clinically photoageing is characterized by coarseness, wrinkling, mottled pigmentation, laxity, telangiectasia, and premalignant and malignant neoplasms. The role of genetics, hormones and diet needs to be clarified. Appropriate lifelong use of sunscreens may minimize many of the changes associated with photoageing.\r"

Conditions of chronic use of sunscreens in human skin, however, are not established but it is possible that, under some circumstances, sunscreen use could enhance skin cancer risk. The use of sunscreens may prevent or inhibit both sun-induced cancers and photoageing, but as yet there is no established method of designating the efficacies of sunscreens for the prevention of the chronic effects of solar UV radiation.

  ".W": "Symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum, a hereditary disease characterized by accelerated light-induced ageing of the skin, are due to deficiencies in the repair of damaged DNA. Following UV irradiation a high incidence of thioguanine-resistant mutations have been observed, which may be a model for the abnormally high incidence of freckling and benign and malignant transformation observed in these patients. Cells from patients with Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy have also been shown to be hypermutable by UV radiation with a similar DNA repair defect, but unlike xeroderma pigmentosum patients they do not experience a higher incidence of skin cancer or freckling. An immunological defect may be a further crucial factor determining the dermatological symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum patients. Much can be learned about the way normal individuals function from a study of aberrant functioning of individuals with defined genetic deficiencies. In the field of senescence of the skin, the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) has been of particular value, as the exposed skin of these sun-sensitive individuals shows at an early age many of the features of aged sun-exposed skin of normal individuals. These features of XP skin include hyperkeratosis, freckling, benign lesions and malignant tumours, including melanomas. A full discussion of this syndrome has been given by Kraemer et al.\r"

  ".W": "The principal functions of the skin include protection, excretion, secretion, absorption, thermoregulation, pigmentogenesis, accumulation, sensory perception and regulation of immunological processes. These functions are all affected by the structural changes in the skin with ageing and, after middle age, most functions are reduced, some by as much as 50-60%. The physiological changes associated with these reductions include impairment of the barrier function, decreased turnover of epidermal cells, reduced numbers of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and a reduced vascular network particularly around hair bulbs and glands. These changes result in fibrosis and atrophy, and decreases in hair and nail growth, vitamin D synthesis and the density of Langerhans cells. Production of epidermal thymocyte-activating factor, which enhances the T-cell response, is reduced leading to a decrease in the immune response; there is also a decreased functioning of Meissner's and Pacinian corpuscles. An increased generation of free radicals is observed. Certain environmental factors, particularly exposure to sun, accelerate the ageing of skin and are important in cutaneous carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In subjects older than 25-30 years the number of enzymatically active melanocytes detectable by the dopa reaction decreases by about 10-20% per decade, with exposed skin having approximately twice as many pigment cells as unexposed skin. Chronic exposure to sunlight may stimulate the epidermal melanocyte system rather than accelerating chronological ageing. The number of melanocytic naevi declines with age. Despite the decreased melanocyte density, photoaged skin has irregular pigmentation and, frequently, there is hyperpigmentation. This may be due to greater positivity of dopa of chronically irradiated melanocytes. Heterogeneity in skin colour in exposed areas of skin is due to uneven distribution of pigment cells, a local loss of melanocytes, and a modification in the interactions between melanocytes and keratinocytes. The most common pigmented lesions in sun-exposed skin include ephelides, actinic lentigo, pigmented solar keratoses and seborrhoeic keratoses, and lentigo maligna. The white spots in aged skin are usually stellate pseudoscars or idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Greying of the hair is due to progressive loss of melanocytes from the hair follicles. In vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to increase overall understanding of the processes involved and to improve treatment of the pigmentary changes in ageing skin.\r"

Phototoxic reactions to common, orally administered drugs such as diuretics, cardiac agents and antidiabetics may occur and the reactions may be remedied by discontinuing drug therapy. Photocontact dermatitis due to the ingredients in sunscreens or other agents, such as perfumes, may also arise. Diagnosis is often confirmed by photopatch testing and subsequent avoidance of these agents leads to gradual resolution. Idiopathic photodermatoses, such as sunlight-induced polymorphic light eruption or solar urticaria, may occur and persist from an early age and, in elderly subjects, they can cause mild to marked disability. The most disturbing disorder of this type is the severe, widespread eczematous chronic actinic dermatitis, which can be difficult to diagnose. Porphyrias, such as variegate porphyria or erythropoietic protoporphyria, may persist from an early age, whereas porphyria cutanea tarda generally begins in later life. Porphyrias all have specific clinical and biochemical features and, apart from variegate porphyria, usually respond well to treatment following diagnosis. Exposure of elderly skin to sunlight may also cause deterioration of many ordinary dermatoses, particularly seborrhoeic eczema, which generally respond to protection from UV exposure and to treatment of the underlying abnormality. Progress in identifying the underlying causes, the availability of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic techniques, and improvements in sunscreen preparations and therapeutic medications will probably significantly reduce abnormal photosensitivity in the elderly in the near future.\r"

Although capillary numbers decline in elderly skin, transcutaneous oxygen pressure at 43 degrees C in elderly skin is no lower than in young subjects. Topical tretinoin (0.05%) increases heat radiation from the skin, but there is no correlation with an improvement in superficial wrinkles. No conclusion is possible regarding the effects of topical tretinoin on transcutaneous oxygen diffusion due to a wide variability in results; sometimes it is increased and sometimes it is decreased. In different regions of the skin, such as the face and thigh, increased skin radiation and skin contact temperature are not associated with increased transcutaneous oxygen diffusion.\r"

As the dermis comprises living tissue, dermal changes are not simply the sum of age-related changes occurring in the mesenchymal cells and the supporting macromolecular structures. Chronological ageing reduces the life of fibroblasts in vitro and, to some extent, in vivo; their potential for division being lower in the elderly. Fibroblasts replicate in vitro but only divide very slowly in vivo. Both endogenous factors, e.g. nutritional and endocrine status, and environmental factors, e.g. UV radiation, toxic compounds or free radicals, affect the functions of fibroblasts and the physical and chemical nature of the supporting macromolecules. Mechanical forces also play an important role in the architectural deterioration of the dermis. In vitro models have been developed using dermal cells and supporting tissue to investigate the factors involved in the ageing process.\r"

Innovations and advances in tissue culture techniques now permit in vitro studies of keratinocytes and other benign and malignant skin-derived cells. The ageing processes and cutaneous neoplasia, therefore, can now be studied at the cellular level. New insights regarding the interrelationship of ageing, environment and cutaneous neoplasia are close at hand. Depletion in the number of Langerhans cells and suppression of their function in ageing and UV-exposed skin may allow tumour cells to overcome the host's defence system. The potential increase in UV irradiation due to depletion of the ozone layer may increase the incidence of skin tumours. Carcinogenesis involves three distinct steps: initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion. The mechanism has been studied in mice, where it is suggested the c-ras oncogene may play an important role.\r"

When considering ageing it is important to distinguish between the effects of true biological ageing and environmental factors, such as exposure to sun. Epidermal changes associated with ageing involve the flattening of its underside, a reduction in the number of Langerhans cells and of melanocytes, and a decline in the number of melanosomes synthesized, leading to reduced pigmentation. Dermal changes involve a reduction in the collagenous and elastic fibres, fibroblasts, mast cells and macrophages, and dilation of the lymphatic channels. The number of hair follicles declines with age, but their structure remains unchanged. Ageing does not affect the sebaceous glands, but some changes occur in the exocrine sweat glands.\r"

Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp is a highly progressive tumour with a poor prognosis, but initially it may be misdiagnosed as a simple bruise or cellulitis. In well-differentiated tumours a characteristic feature is interlacing endothelial cell-lined channels showing considerable nuclear atypia. Merkel cell tumours, which develop as deep-seated nodules in the skin, occur most frequently in photodamaged areas, especially on the head and neck. The prognosis of Merkel cell tumours is generally poor; histological evidence suggests that some of these tumours may be a special type of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Atypical fibroxanthoma, which is normally benign, occurs most frequently in elderly, fair-skinned males, especially around the face. It is typically a polypoid lesion with a vascular appearance. Acantholytic squamous cell carcinomas, also known as adenoid squamous cell carcinomas, are most common in fair-skinned men with a history of keratoses. They also occur in the female genital region and the oral mucosa. Histologically, these tumours differ from squamous cell carcinomas because of their tendency to form duct-like areas in tumour lobules.\r"

In the 1970s, evidence accumulated to show that topical tretinoin could modulate many of the abnormalities in the epidermis and dermis associated with photoageing. It has been shown in hairless mice that tretinoin can reverse dermal elastosis with the formation of new collagen and this has led to clinical trials being carried out in man. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin.\r"

Tretinoin treatment produced an improvement in the signs of extrinsic ageing compared with the vehicle-treated areas. Fine wrinkling was improved most, although coarse wrinkling, brown spots, tactile roughness and overall skin colour also showed clear improvement. The majority of lentigines and sun-induced freckles showed some reduction in coloration with extended treatment. It is important when using tretinoin that the treatment procedure is carefully explained to the patients and that they are warned about a retinoid reaction. It should be stressed that improvement is gradual and that regular application of the cream must continue even after improvement has been achieved. Patients should be assured that there is no evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Although no teratogenic effects of tretinoin have been reported when applied topically, it is not advisable to use the cream when trying to conceive or when pregnant.\r"

The clinical symptoms of photoageing (coarse wrinkling, fine wrinkling, skin thinning, mottled hyperpigmentation, laxity and xerosis) were evaluated before and after therapy. A total of 19.1% of patients withdrew from the study; only 5.6% were for treatment-related reasons. At the end of the treatment period all the clinical parameters, except xerosis, were improved. The amount of improvement varied, but only 4.2% of patients failed to show any improvement. Tolerability was excellent in 51.4% of patients, good in 44.4% and fair in 4.2%, and compliance was excellent in 47.0% of patients, good in 48.5% and fair in 4.5%.

Twenty-four of the 28 glaucoma patients (86%) had a significant disparity in brightness ratio between the two eyes. This was found to match the frequency of visual field loss. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the interocular differences in brightness sense and the difference in the degree of visual field loss between the two eyes. Of the glaucoma patients 39% had sum contrast sensitivities outside the normal range for age-matched normal controls. No significant correlation was found between the interocular difference in brightness sense and the visual acuity or the interocular difference in sum contrast sensitivity. It is concluded that, in the presence of a normal visual acuity, the brightness ratio test warrants evaluation as a potential screening test for chronic open angle glaucoma.\r"

Due to this intensification, the relapse rate, but not the rate of induction failures, was reduced. The probability of a 6-year event-free survival increased from 38%, SD 4%, in study AML-BFM-78 to 49%, SD 4%, in study AML-BFM-83, P = .08. The improvement of the 6-year event-free interval (EFI) was significant in the second study (61%, SD 4%, versus 47%, SD 5%, P less than .05); it was restricted to the FAB types M1 through M4 (EFI: 67%, SD 5%, versus 45%, SD 5%, P less than .01). The difference in EFI seen in FAB M5 was not statistically significant (EFI: 40%, SD 10%, versus 63%, SD 11%, NS). According to the results of the second study, two different risk groups (low and high) could be identified by combinations of predominantly pretherapeutic parameters. The low risk group, comprising 37% of the patients who achieved complete remission, included the FAB types with granulocytic differentiation and specific additional features: FAB M1 with Auer rods, FAB M2 with white blood cell count of less than 20,000/microL, FAB M3 all patients, and FAB M4 with eosinophilia. The 6-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of EFI is 91%, SD 4%, compared with 42%, SD 6% in the high risk group. In future studies based on the AML-BFM-83 treatment, bone marrow transplantation in first remission should be mandatory only for children of the high risk group.\r"

CD34+ cells were detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) cells at incidences of 1.0% and 0.01% of total mononuclear cells, respectively. Single cell cultures revealed that approximately 37% of BM CD34+ cells formed colonies in the presence of phytohemagglutinin-leukocyte conditioned medium and erythropoietin. Erythroid bursts-, granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-, and pure macrophage (Mac) colony-forming cells were 10% each in CD34+ cells. Approximately 15% of PB CD34+ cells formed colonies in which erythroid bursts were predominant. CD34+ cells were heterogeneous and fractionated by several antibodies in FACS multicolor analysis. In these fractionated cells, CD34+, CD33+ cells formed GM and Mac colonies 7 to 10 times as often as CD34+, CD33- cells. Most of the erythroid bursts and colonies were observed in the fraction of CD34+, CD13- cells or CD34+, CD33- cells. The expression of HLA-DR on CD34+ cells was not related to the incidence, size, or type of colonies. There was no difference in the phenotypical heterogeneity of CD34+ cells between BM and PB. About 10% of CD34+ cells were able to form G colonies in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and to form Mac colonies in GM-CSF or interleukin-3 (IL-3). Progenitors capable of generating colonies by stimulation of G-CSF were more enriched in CD34+, CD33+ fraction than in CD34+, CD33- fraction. Thus, single cell cultures using the FACS clone-sorting system provide an accurate estimation of hematopoietic progenitors and an assay system for direct action of colony-stimulating factors.\r"

When the patients with congenital disease were treated with G-CSF, the cycling of blood cells persisted, but the cycle length was shortened from 21 days to 14 days, and the amplitude of variations in blood counts increased. There was a parallel shortening of the cycle and increase of the amplitude of variations (from two- to three-fold to 10- to 100-fold) in the number of both types of circulating progenitor cells in these two patients. In the patient with acquired cyclic neutropenia, cycling of both blood cells and progenitors could not be seen. In cultures deprived of fetal bovine serum, erythroid and myeloid bone marrow progenitor cells from untreated patients and from normals differed in growth factor responsiveness. As examples, maximal growth of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies was induced by granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-CSF plus G-CSF in the patients, whereas a combination of GM-CSF, G-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3) was required in the normals, and erythropoietin alone induced fourfold more erythroid bursts from cyclic neutropenic patients than from normal donors (46% versus 11% of the maximal colony number, respectively). The growth factor responsiveness of marrow progenitor cells slightly changed during the treatment toward the values observed with normal progenitors. These results indicate that treatment with G-CSF not only ameliorated the neutropenia, but also increased the amplitude and the frequency of oscillation of circulating progenitor cell numbers. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that G-CSF therapy affects the proliferation of the hematopoietic stem cell.\r"

Regardless of the serostatus of the donor, infection with CMV resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation and colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in response to both growth factors, with more pronounced suppression in response to G-CSF being observed. Evaluation of the colony composition revealed a profound decrease in colonies of the granulocytic (CFU-G), or granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) lineages, while suppression of multipotential (CFU-GEMM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colony-forming cells occurred after infection with wild-type but not the laboratory strain of CMV. Although no evidence of productive virus infection could be seen in colony-forming cells, in situ hybridization studies and immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of CMV-specific mRNA and immediate-early antigens, demonstrating that a small proportion of cells were abortively infected. These studies demonstrate that CMV can infect bone marrow progenitor cells and interfere with normal hematopoiesis in vitro, which may help to explain the hematologic defects seen during acute infections with CMV in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhM-CSF) was given to cynomolgus monkeys by continuous intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection, at a dose of 50 to 100 micrograms/kg/d in repetitive 14-day cycles. Starting within 24 to 48 hours of initiation of rhM-CSF, there was a progressive increase in the number of circulating monocytes, from a baseline of 811 +/- 253 cells/microL to a peak of 3,495 +/- 712 cells/microL on day 5 to 7. Many of these cells were large, granular, and extensively vacuolated. The expanded cell population expressed HLA-DR, LFA3, CD11b (904), and CD14 (MY4), and was 77% CD16 (FcRIII) positive by two-color cytofluorometry. In functional assays, fresh monocytes showed little cytotoxicity against cultured human melanoma cells (SKMel-1), with or without prior rhM-CSF treatment. However, after 3 days of in vitro culture in rhM-CSF, monocytes from treated animals mediated efficient antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) against SKMel-1 using the murine monoclonal antibody 3F8 (IgG3, anti-ganglioside GD2). Under the same conditions, monocytes from control animals showed little ADCC (17% versus 82%, P less than .05). Antitumor cytotoxicity in the absence of antibody was less efficient and was not significantly different between the two groups. There was a mild decrease in platelet count during rhM-CSF treatment, without clinical symptoms. No abnormalities of serum biochemical parameters were seen. We conclude that parenteral rhM-CSF increases the number of circulating monocytes in nonhuman primates, and that these monocytes mediate increased antitumor ADCC after a brief period of in vitro differentiation. This study has implications for the design of possible future clinical trials combining antitumor monoclonal antibodies and rhM-CSF.\r"

In trail A infants were randomly allocated banked donor milk or preterm formula as their sole diet or (separately randomised) as a supplement to their mother's expressed breast milk. In trial B infants were allocated term or preterm formula. A blind follow up examination was done 18 months after the expected date of birth. SETTING--Neonatal units of hospitals in Cambridge, Ipswich, King's Lynn, Norwich, and Sheffield. Outpatient follow up. PARTICIPANTS--777 Infants with a birth weight less than 1850 g born during 1982 to 1984. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of eczema, allergic reactions to food or drugs, and asthma or wheezing by nine and 18 months after term. Whenever possible the observations were confirmed by rechallenge or clinical examination. RESULTS--At 18 months after term there was no difference in the incidence of allergic reactions between dietary groups in either trial. In the subgroup of infants with a family history of atopy, however, those in trial A who received preterm formula rather than human milk had a significantly greater risk of developing one or more allergic reactions (notably eczema) by 18 months (odds ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 9.1). CONCLUSIONS--Feeding neonates on formulas based on cows' milk, including those with a high protein content, did not increase the overall risk of allergy. Nevertheless, in the subgroup with a family history of atopy early exposure to cows' milk increased the risk of a wide range of allergic reactions, especially eczema.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective multicentre study comparing the mortality of patients admitted on a one off or rotational basis with that experienced while they were awaiting admission. SETTING--A wide range of urban and rural district general, geriatric or long stay, and general practitioner hospitals. PATIENTS--474 Patients aged 70 or over who had 601 admissions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death. RESULTS--16 (3.4%) Of the 474 patients (2.7% of all 601 admissions) died while in hospital during an average stay of 15.7 days whereas 23 (4.9%) patients died while awaiting admission (average waiting time was 34.2 days). The 16 deaths in hospital and the 23 deaths during the longer waiting period correspond to death rates of 19.9 and 12.5 per 10,000 person days respectively. The difference between these of 7.4 is not statistically significant (95% confidence interval -3.6 to 18.3). The estimated relative risk of dying in hospital is 1.59 but the 95% confidence interval is wide (0.84 to 3.01). CONCLUSION--Although the death rates are slightly higher in those admitted to hospital for relief care than in those awaiting admission, the difference was not significant, and the death rate in both groups was reassuringly small.\r"

  ".W": "From 1984 through 1986, 205 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were entered into a group-wide trial of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK). This trial evaluated the combination of mitomycin (8 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on day 1), vindesine (3 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8), and cisplatin (60 mg/m2 IV on day 1) with forced diuresis, repeated every 4 weeks (MiViP regimen). One hundred eighty-three patients were evaluable. Six complete and 69 partial responses were documented for an overall response rate of 41% (95% confidence interval, 34% to 50%). In the multivariate analysis the strongest predictors for response were the participating institution and the number of initially involved organ sites. The estimated median time to progression for patients with a complete response, partial response, or stable disease was 155 days (estimated inter-quartile range, 99 to 258 days). In the multivariate analysis the time to progression was significantly associated with the number of involved organ sites (P = 0.041). The estimated median survival time for the 183 evaluable patients was 239 days (estimated inter-quartile range, 137 to 436 days). In univariate and multivariate analyses performance status, number of involved organ sites, pretreatment status with radiation therapy, and participating institution were all significantly associated with survival. The principal toxicities were myelosuppression and nausea and vomiting with 16% of the patients refusing further treatment after a median of four cycles of chemotherapy. In conclusion, the MiViP regimen was an active combination chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in a large trial performed by the SAKK. The prognostic value of the participating institution and the number of organ sites involved by metastatic deposits in non-small cell lung cancer needs further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of four cycles of carboplatin (CBDCA) + etoposide + bleomycin (EBC) was conducted in 32 previously poor-risk nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (GCT) patients and the results compared with past studies. Patients with extragonadal (nine patients) and testicular nonseminomatous GCT with a probability of complete response (CR) less than 0.5 as calculated by a mathematical model using marker values and number of metastatic sites (23 patients) were included. Nineteen patients (59%) achieved a CR and 14 complete responders (43%) remain free of disease. The overall and durable CR proportions were similar to those observed in prior poor-risk studies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity. Based on the low CR proportion, EBC is no better than other standard programs for poor-risk GCT. However, its ease of administration as an outpatient, mild renal and gastrointestinal toxicity, and efficacy comparable to cisplatin-based chemotherapy used in prior poor-risk trials at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center warrant a Phase III trial comparing CBDCA-based and cisplatin-based chemotherapy for good-risk GCT patients.\r"

  ".U": "90248904\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy-six patients with primary gastric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (PGL) were diagnosed, and 75 were treated between 1975 and 1985. According to the Working Formulation 22 patients had low-grade malignant histologic subtypes, 27 intermediate-grade, and 27 high-grade. Twenty-four cases were diagnosed by endoscopic biopsies, 52 through laparotomy biopsies. Forty-five underwent subtotal or total gastric resection; seven were considered unresectable at laparotomy; 23 did not undergo surgery because of the high operative risk, mainly due to advanced age and coexisting diseases; and one died of myocardial infarction a few days after admission, before starting therapy. All patients who did not undergo laparotomy were staged with bipedal lymphangiography or abdominal ultrasonography and/or computed tomography. Stage, evaluated according to the criteria of Musshoff, was I or II1 in 16 cases, II2 in five, and IV in the remaining 55. Treatment modalities included surgery (S), chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), and combinations thereof in the following proportions: only S in ten cases, S + CT in 32 cases, S + RT in one case, S + CT + RT in two cases, CT only in 25 cases, CT + RT in five cases. No substantial differences in response to therapy and in survival were found in relation to the different treatments. Ten-year survival was 43% in Stage I or II and 20% in Stage IV. Of the 45 resected patients, five postoperative deaths were recorded (11%). No bleeding or perforations were observed in the 30 unresected patients, and survival of such cases compared with that of the resected ones. These findings, together with data from the literature, suggest that some of the advantages claimed for surgery in PGL (debulking and abatement of the risk of perforation or hemorrhage during CT or RT) have been overestimated in relation to the intrinsic surgical risk and to the possibility of anticancer therapy. Gastric resection may still be unavoidable as a diagnostic procedure in a minority of cases and may represent the primary therapeutic procedure in clinically assessed early-stage and low-risk patients, but it cannot be considered mandatory whenever possible merely for debulking purposes or to obviate possible perforation or hemorrhage. The CT and/or RT can be effective in unresected and even bulky cases, providing minimal risk of severe hemorrhage or perforation.\r"

The authors examined 22 colorectal carcinomas and 51 colorectal adenomas from 41 familial polyposis coli patients and observed mutations at codons 12 and 13 in eight of 22 colorectal carcinomas (36%) and six of 51 colorectal adenomas (12%). Thus, the frequency and sites of K-ras gene mutation in colorectal carcinoma from familial polyposis coli patients are similar to those in cases of sporadic colorectal carcinoma and may not be the first genetic event linked to the tumorigenesis.\r"
