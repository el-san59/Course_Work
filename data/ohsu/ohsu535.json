Simplicity of insertion, mechanical reliability, and the ability to give alternate firmness and flaccidity to the penis account for its widespread acceptance. Selection of patients is important, excluding those with impaired manual dexterity who would become frustrated in learning to operate the inflation-deflation mechanism of this device. Also, this prosthesis is somewhat bulky and cannot be crammed satisfactorily into the unusually small penis. When turgid, it does not expand beyond fixed limits and so would not fill the exceptionally large penis, resulting in a relatively unstable erection in such a patient. Appropriate sizing of the cylinders, especially the width, is important for a successful outcome.\r"

The device is readily implantable in approximately 1 hour with techniques familiar to most urologists who have implanted rigid or semirigid rods. 2. With attention to detail, prosthesis sizing is straightforward using intraoperative determination of corporeal girth and total corporeal length. We were unable reliably to predict prosthesis size preoperatively. Hence, as with other inflatable prostheses, we recommend that an entire range of prosthesis sizes be available at implantation. 3. Mechanical reliability is similar to that of more complex inflatable devices. The mechanical malfunction rate has been 11.6 per cent over a 15.1-month follow-up. 4. Patients find the inflation-deflation mechanisms easy to master. 5. Spontaneous deflation does occur during intercourse in some instances, but most patients are able to adjust sexual techniques and position satisfactorily with minimal disruption of enjoyment for themselves and their partners. 6. Among individuals with functional prostheses, a detailed survey of patient and partner response postoperatively revealed a high level of satisfaction for both and a return to premorbid levels of sexual functioning. Concealability was good in the flaccid state, and patients report minimal difficulties or embarassment with everyday functions in public restrooms and shower situations.\r"

Changes in design that do not address this extremely significant concern, namely, device reliability, fail in their commitment toward improvement in patient satisfaction. One of the most effective ways to assess the benefits provided by any change in device design is through the clinical trial and study group method, utilizing a large number of implanting surgeons from a variety of backgrounds and with a variety of patients. The results of the clinical trials with the AMS 700 CX cylinders were extremely encouraging. More importantly, the findings of the study group and our own findings have been substantiated through widespread clinical application among an even larger number of implanting physicians. Device reliability should continue to be under serious scrutiny. We, as implanting physicians, are constantly being asked by our patients, \"How long can I expect this device to function?\" The answer can only be given on the basis of reports such as this and others that address the results of implantation in a series of patients who are followed appropriately year after year. Each year these reports, if brought up to date, will become even more meaningful. Meanwhile, new designs continue to be evaluated in the laboratory and will become a reality only through the suggestions provided by implanting surgeons, whose observations, when relayed to the manufacturer, enable the design engineer to address the specific concerns of both patient and physician. The AMS 700 CX inflatable penile prosthesis with its new controlled expansion cylinders has certainly addressed those concerns for the present.\r"

If the goal of surgery is to restore sexual frequency, variety, and pleasure to optimal levels, an integrated treatment program that incorporates sex therapy may be more successful than implantation alone. The type of sex therapy required depends on the risk factors present for postsurgery sexual dissatisfaction. A majority of patients can benefit from several sessions of brief sexual counseling preoperatively, with routine follow-up at 3 and 6 months after surgery to identify problems in resuming sex successfully. I also would point out that an integrated treatment approach is just as applicable to home intracavernosal injection programs. Including sex therapy in the package might reduce the large drop-out rates currently being seen and might decrease the risk of misuse of these medications.\r"

Specimens were obtained from otherwise healthy patient groups as follows: group A, 7 fertile control subjects; group B, 12 azoospermic men after vasectomy; and group C, 11 patients presenting for infertility evaluation. Correlations between established semen analysis parameters and the 31P-MRS-derived ratio of glycerylphosphorylcholine to total phosphate (GPC/TP) were investigated. Group A controls had a mean GPC/TC ratio of 0.10 +/- 0.05, which was the same as that of group C. With the exception of significantly lowered motility and normal morphology in group C (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) semen analysis parameters in these two groups were similar. In contrast, the GPC/TP ratio in group B (0.05 +/- 0.04) was significantly different from the control (p less than 0.05), which appropriately reflected complete vasal occlusion. The results suggest that a significant portion of seminal GPC is derived from epididymal secretion and that 31P-MRS is useful for monitoring the GPC/TP levels when assessing epididymal function and male infertility.\r"

Two patients continue to require antihypertensive medication to control their hypertension. There were no major complications directly related to intra-arterial injection of ethanol. Transcatheter renal ablation employing intra-arterial injection of absolute ethanol for control of severe hypertension appears to be a safe and efficacious procedure.

Twenty-six patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and 10 continent female patients were evaluated during the single cough, the first and the fourth ones of the forced coughings in supine and standing positions. The results were compared with those obtained with the conventional two-transducer method. Negative urethral closure pressure (UCP) at stress, indicative of SUI, was present in 88 percent of the cases with the six-transducer method, and in 77 percent with the two-transducer method. The fourth cough in the standing position with the six-transducer method was most diagnostic. In SUI, the six-transducer method indicated exactly, e.g., the minimum bladder pressure needed for negative UCP and the duration of negative UCP. Patients with SUI had significantly lower UCP at rest, UCP at stress, and pressure transmission ratio (PTR) than continent women. Findings, that UCP at stress decreased and duration of negative UCP at stress increased but PTR did not change when the fourth cough was compared with the first one in SUI, suggest that factors which are responsible for the altered urodynamics during prolonged stress are anatomic rather than functional.\r"

Serum chemistries and urine osmolality determinations were performed approximately every three months for a year. Mean patient values for each time period were then compiled and compared with the norms and with the preoperative values. The mean serum electrolyte values were found to be within normal limits during all follow-up periods. Fourteen patients were identified, however, as having values falling intermittently outside of the normal range. These patients were investigated and found to be abnormal during episodes of acute renal failure usually secondary to dehydration or obstruction at which time they usually became acidotic and occasionally hyperchloremic. These problems disappeared when the renal failure was corrected. This study corroborated our previously reported findings that hyperchloremic acidosis or other metabolic alterations requiring replacement therapy do not routinely occur in this population.\r"

Bladder specimens fixed in 25% ethanol within sixty minutes of collection were found to be superior to unfixed bladder specimens. The percentage of specimens with good DNA resolution was greater for bladder washings (67% unfixed, 90% fixed) than voided urines (41% unfixed, 66% fixed). There was no difference in DNA resolution between specimens that remained unfixed less than one day, one day, or two days suggesting that the cells undergo the majority of degradation within a critical period soon after collection. Once fixed, there was no difference in DNA resolution for up to nineteen days, which suggests the feasibility of specimen transport to central FCM laboratories. Eighteen percent of unfixed bladder washings and 33 percent of unfixed voided urine specimens contained an insufficient number of cells (less than 5,000) at the time of analysis compared with 6 percent bladder washings and 17 percent voided urines fixed in 25% ethanol. Flow cytometry and cytology results were concordant in 28/43 (65%) of fixed bladder washings and 9/13 (69%) of fixed voided urine. Voided urine was unreliable in providing consistent FCM data due to the high number of specimens with poor resolution or insufficient cells and is not recommended as a substitute for bladder washing when screening high-risk populations or monitoring patients with past history of bladder cancer.\r"

This is related to T2 increases in infarct zones that have been verified previously by relaxometry measurements in excised myocardial samples. Accordingly the present study was undertaken to evaluate a 1H NMR imaging method to optimize T2 contrast and measure infarct size in a high-field imaging system (1.5 T). To accomplish this, NMR images were acquired every other R wave with echo times of 30 and 100 msec. The first echo image was used for myocardial border definition and the second echo image, which highlighted the myocardial infarction, for infarct border definition. This T2-weighted approach yielded a significant correlation between infarct size by NMR and pathologic methods. However, NMR imaging tended to overestimate infarct size, and the NMR image depicted abnormal signal well beyond the extent of the pathology-determined infarct. There was a significant relationship between NMR-imaged infarct size and myocardial mass with microsphere-determined reduction in blood flow of 25% or more. These data suggest that T2-weighted NMR imaging depicts not only infarct but also some reversibly injured myocardium.\r"

In only 9 of the 32 patients who had progression during both intervals was the same lesion involved, and in six of these patients other lesions were also involved. Progression correlated with the duration of the interval between catheterizations, an increase in symptoms, and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences in mean values for age, blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, and serum triglycerides in the four main progression groups. Progression of coronary atherosclerosis is a highly unpredictable process. It follows a nonlinear course, and information derived from sequential coronary arteriograms is of little value in predicting future progression.\r"

To investigate more thoroughly this pathophysiologic aspect we evaluated (by means of quantitative coronary angiography) the acute vasomotor reaction to nifedipine (10 mg sublingually) of significant (greater than 50%) stenotic lesions in 22 patients with double-component angina. We also correlated this reaction with the clinical response (daily number of ischemic episodes evaluated by means of 48-hour Holter ambulatory monitoring) to treatment with nifedipine (20 mg four times a day); calcium channel blockade, in fact, is considered a specific remedy in cases of altered coronary vasomotility. Patients with Prinzmetal angina, who were known to have homogeneous coronary vasodilating reactions and favorable clinical responses to nifedipine, were studied by means of the same methods and served as the control group (14 patients). In double-component angina the residual lumen diameter of significant lesions was unchanged in two patients, enhanced in 10, and reduced in 10 after sublingual nifedipine; lumen variations from baseline values ranged from +1.29 to -1.56 mm. Acute changes in stenosis correlated closely with results obtained with oral treatment. In the group with Prinzmetal angina, coronary stenoses invariably responded with dilatation (the residual coronary lumen increased by an average of 69% of baseline); 100% of the patients in this group responded favorably to treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thermal energy with compression produces fusion of separated arterial wall layers, and heat appears to alter the elastic recoil of the vessel wall. Radiofrequency (RF) thermal energy has been used to perform vascular anastomoses and thermal angioplasty. A simple in vivo experiment was designed to describe and quantitate vascular tissue weld strength produced by a range of RF thermal energy levels. Canine carotid arteries were compressed between a pair of modified bipolar forceps that applied RF energy, causing occlusive tissue welds between the apposed intimal surfaces. The strength of the welds was evaluated by measuring the perfusion pressure required to reopen the vessel lumen. A dosimetry range of 0 to 205 joules showed a typical dose-response curve for the relationship between energy applied and bond strength, plateauing at approximately 300 mm Hg. Light microscopy showed fusion of the inner surfaces of the vessel with preservation of vessel wall architecture. Additionally inflation of a bipolar RF balloon catheter in the normal canine carotid lumen produced an alteration of vessel profile angiographically and histologically. Results of these preliminary experiments suggest that balloon angioplasty with adjunctive RF thermal energy may have benefits in reducing the factors causing acute failure of conventional percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty.\r"

We investigated whether, in dogs with a healed anterior myocardial infarction at low and high risk for ventricular fibrillation, acute exposure to CO has adverse effects during acute myocardial ischemia combined with exercise. One month after myocardial infarction, 17 dogs had ventricular fibrillation and 16 survived during the combined exercise and ischemia test. These tests were then repeated in all dogs with different concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) (from 5% to 15%). With 15% COHb, heart rate (HR) at rest and during exercise was higher (p less than 0.05) than in the control tests. Surprisingly, the reflex HR response to acute ischemia was also altered; namely, the HR reduction characteristic of the low-risk animals was anticipated and accentuated (-31 +/- 25 versus 2 +/- 30 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Conversely, the HR increase characteristic of the high-risk group was reduced by CO (44 +/- 52 versus 72 +/- 43 beats/min, p less than 0.05). With 15% COHb, malignant arrhythmias occurred in two of the low-risk dogs and in none of the high-risk dogs. In the latter, CO was tested with a combination of exercise work load and myocardial ischemia duration not associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the control condition. This study demonstrated that brief exposure to CO (1) profoundly alters the reflex HR response to exercise and to acute myocardial ischemia and (2) does not enhance the occurrence of malignant arrhythmias in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction.\r"

The biphasic waveform had a positive phase identical to that of the monophasic waveform and a negative phase of equal duration with its initial voltage equal to 50% of the final voltage of the positive phase. Defibrillation shocks of varying initial voltage were delivered to construct curves of the percentage of successful defibrillation versus initial voltage and delivered energy, and the voltage and energy required for 50% (V50 and E50, respectively) and 80% (V80 and E80, respectively) success were compared. The biphasic waveform had significantly lower initial voltage (V50: 194 +/- 48 volts vs 227 +/- 48 volts, p less than 0.001; V80: 217 +/- 55 volts vs 256 +/- 66 volts, p less than 0.02) and energy (E50: 2.7 +/- 1.3 joules vs 3.4 +/- 1.5 joules, p less than 0.01; E80: 3.4 +/- 1.6 joules vs 4.3 +/- 2.2 joules, p less than 0.05) requirements than the monophasic waveform. It is concluded that a biphasic waveform produced by a single discharge that uses the \"free\" energy remaining on the capacitors significantly reduces the initial voltage and energy requirements for successful defibrillation and may improve the efficacy of future automatic implantable defibrillators.\r"

Sixty-five, 3-week-old cesarean-derived 1 (CD 1) mice were divided into two groups: group I (noninfected animals) and group II (infected with coxsackievirus B3). Mice from each group were killed on days 7, 17, 30, or 90 of infection. Forty-eight hours before killing, mice were injected with monoclonal I125 antimyosin, Fab (25 microCi/injection) and radioactivity was counted in the heart. Selected heart sections were also examined by autoradiography. Heart radioactivity, count/m/mg (m +/- SEM) on days 7, 17, 30, and 90 of infection was 10.8 +/- 1.7, 21.3 +/- 1.1, 11.2 +/- 3.4, and 12.4 +/- 1.5 for group I, versus 36.7 +/- 8.0 (p less than 0.01), 50.0 +/- 4.5 (p less than 0.001), 33.4 +/- 16.1 (p = NS), and 40.6 +/- 8.5 (p less than 0.01) for group II, respectively. Autoradiography revealed focal uptake within areas of necrotic myocardium. We conclude that I125 Fab may be useful in detecting myocardial damage in the experimental model of murine myocarditis up to day 90 of infection.\r"

Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after ingestion of drug. Indices of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function were derived from digitized tracings of the septal and posterior endocardial surfaces and transmitral and aortic valve velocity profiles. Ibopamine significantly improved systolic function as reflected by a decrease in the preejection period to left ventricular ejection time ratio from 0.57 +/- 0.16 at baseline to 0.47 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.05) 30 minutes after ingestion of drug. The maximum improvements in stroke volume and cardiac output after ibopamine were from 63 +/- 35 to 72 +/- 40 ml (p less than 0.05) and 4.6 +/- 1.7 to 5.4 +/- 2.1 L/min (p = 0.05), respectively. The contribution of atrial systole to total diastolic filling increased from 32 +/- 10% at baseline to 37 +/- 12% (p less than 0.05) after 30 minutes and persisted for at least 120 minutes. The distribution of diastolic filling was significantly altered after ingestion of ibopamine as reflected by a decrease in the ratio of the time-velocity integrals of left ventricular filling during early diastole and atrial systole (Ei/Ai) from 2.44 +/- 1.08 at baseline to 1.98 +/- 0.97 (p less than 0.05) 30 minutes after drug. The decrease in the Ei/Ai persisted for at least 120 minutes. The duration of the effect of ibopamine on diastolic filling persisted longer than its effect on augmenting systolic function. The positive effect of ibopamine on systolic function makes it a promising drug in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Although several Doppler echocardiographic methods for measuring transmitral flow have been described, the optimal method for calculation of flow remains unclear. Seven time/shape combinations were tested in an experimental preparation in which mitral flow could be precisely controlled and measured. Annular shape was considered to be either circular or elliptical, and the mitral orifice area was calculated from the anteroposterior and/or the mediolateral dimension(s) recorded at early and middiastole. In addition the orifice area was calculated from the maximal mitral leaflet area corrected for diastolic variation. Transmitral flow ranged between 0.4 and 4.6 L/min. Good correlations with measured transmitral flow (r = 0.83 to 0.92) were observed for all methods of calculating the mitral orifice area. Methods that assumed a circular geometry and used the mediolateral annular diameter overestimated flow. Conversely, flows calculated by means of the anteroposterior diameter with the assumption of a circular anulus underestimated flow. The best approximations of transmitral flow were obtained with the assumption of an elliptical configuration that used measurements made in early diastole (Y = 1.04x + 0.2) and with the Fisher method (y = 0.94x + 0.08). Thus in the canine model approximation of the mitral orifice as an ellipse provides the most accurate measurement of transmitral flow.\r"

Accordingly 20 adult patients with severe symptomatic calcific aortic stenosis underwent first-pass radionuclide angiography and Doppler echocardiography before, immediately after, and 2 to 4 days after the valvuloplasty procedure. A significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in peak-to-peak (72 +/- 24 mm Hg to 36 +/- 11 mmHg) and mean (60 +/- 20 mm Hg to 34 +/- 9 mm Hg) transaortic gradient and an increase in aortic valve area (0.5 +/- 0.2 cm2 to 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm2) were measured by high-fidelity micromanometer catheters immediately after aortic valvuloplasty. Results of Doppler echocardiography showed a significant (p less than 0.001) immediate decrease in peak instantaneous (81 +/- 22 mm Hg to 53 +/- 15 mm Hg) and mean (48 +/- 14 mm Hg to 31 +/- 9 mm Hg) aortic gradients.

Aortic valve area as determined by the continuity equation also increased from 0.4 +/- 0.2 cm2 to 0.6 +/- 0.2 cm2 immediately after the procedure (p less than 0.001), then partially returned to baseline (0.5 +/- 0.2 cm2; p less than 0.005) at 2 to 4 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By means of a 1.5 Tesla GE superconducting magnet and a standard spin-echo pulse sequence, multiple gated short-axis and axial slices of the entire left ventricle were obtained. LV mass was determined by Simpson's rule with the use of a previous experimentally validated method. The weight of the LV apex (subject to partial volume effect in the short-axis images) was derived from axial slices and that of the remaining left ventricle from short-axis slices. The weight of each slice was calculated by multiplying the planimetered surface area of the LV myocardium by slice thickness and by myocardial specific gravity (1.05). Mean +/- standard deviation of LV mass and LV mass index were 146 +/- 23.1 gm (range 92.3 to 190.4 gm) and 78.4 +/- 7.8 gm/m2 (range 57.7 to 89.4 gm/m2), respectively. Interobserver agreement as assessed by ICC was high for determining 161 individual slice masses (ICC = 0.99) and for total LV mass (ICC = 0.97). Intraobserver agreement for total LV mass was also high (ICC = 0.96). NMRI-determined LV mass correlated with body surface area: LV mass = 55 + 108 body surface area, r = 0.83; with body weight: LV mass = 26 + 0.77 body weight, r = 0.82; and with body height: LV mass = 262 +/- 5.9 body height, r = 0.75. Normal limits were developed for these relationships. NMRI-determined LV mass as related to body weight was in agreement with normal limits derived from autopsy literature data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five patients greater than 70 years of age with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were treated with emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Seventeen (49%) patients received previous thrombolytic therapy: streptokinase (10 patients), tissue plasminogen activator (6) and combined tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase (1). Infarct-related artery patency was achieved in 26 patients (74%) after PTCA. Total in-hospital mortality was 34%. Univariate analysis showed a higher in-hospital mortality in patients with an occluded vessel after PTCA (78%) than in those patients with a patient infarct-related artery (19%) (p = 0.003). Symptomatic coronary reocclusion occurred in 3 patients (15%) during the hospital stay. Compared with emergency PTCA in 200 consecutively treated patients less than 70 years of age, the in-hospital mortality was increased (34 vs 6%, p less than 0.001), and the primary success rate was reduced (66 vs 90%, p less than 0.001). At a mean follow-up of 28 months, there has been a 13% out-of-hospital mortality rate in the elderly patients (3 patients died). Of the 20 surviving patients, 14 are asymptomatic and 6 have class II angina. In conclusion, emergency PTCA for AMI in elderly patients is associated with a decreased success rate and a higher mortality rate. However, the in-hospital mortality rate is not dissimilar to that in elderly AMI patients treated with conventional therapy or thrombolytic therapy alone, and the postdischarge mortality rates are low.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventeen consecutive patients undergoing repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were studied to assess procedural success and recurrent restenosis rates. Clinical, anatomic and procedural variables were examined as predictors of recurrent restenosis using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Primary success was achieved in 114 patients (97.5%). One patient (0.8%) died after acute occlusion. No other in-hospital complications were encountered. After a mean follow-up interval of 218 +/- 160 days, 72 of 114 successfully dilated patients (63%) remained angina free. There were no late deaths. Three patients (2.6%) experienced a late myocardial infarction. Follow-up arteriography was performed in 100 patients (88%), of whom 32% had recurrent restenosis (greater than 50% luminal diameter narrowing). On univariate analysis, the presence of 3 clinical variables at repeat PTCA was associated with significantly higher recurrent restenosis rates compared with their absence, that is, unstable angina (48 vs 20%, p = 0.003), diabetes (61 vs 26%, p = 0.003) and hypertension (46 vs 18%, p = 0.003). Patients with recurrent restenosis had a shorter interval between first and second PTCA compared with those who remained patent (136 +/- 116 vs 214 +/- 163 days, p = 0.018). Multivariate analysis confirmed unstable angina, diabetes and hypertension as independent predictors of recurrent restenosis. Repeat PTCA may be performed for restenosis with a high likelihood of success and low incidence of complications. The rate of recurrent restenosis is similar to that reported for initial angioplasty. Patients with unstable angina, diabetes and hypertension appear to be at higher risk for recurrent restenosis.\r"

All patients had 1-vessel coronary artery disease with visualized collaterals. Intravenous dipyridamole increased myocardial ischemia during inflations. ST elevation, as measured by intracoronary electrogram, increased significantly from the control inflation to the second inflation after dipyridamole injection (0.05 +/- 0.23 vs 0.44 +/- 0.43 mV, p less than 0.03). Of the 10 patients, 8 developed new or more severe angina with subsequent inflations after dipyridamole. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased significantly from the control inflation to the fourth inflation (15 +/- 8 vs 20 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The coronary wedge pressure showed a decreasing trend with subsequent inflations after dipyridamole but did not reach statistical significance. The double product (heart rate X blood pressure) was not significantly altered by dipyridamole. The findings indicate that intravenous dipyridamole increases myocardial ischemia during balloon occlusion. The constancy of the double product and the trend toward a decrease in coronary wedge pressure suggest that dipyridamole may induce ischemia by reducing the amount of collateral flow through a coronary steal phenomenon.\r"

Simultaneous 2-dimensional echocardiographic and biventricular hemodynamic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes) was performed in 19 patients. All patients had a normal resting function. Eleven of the 19 patients had a positive echocardiography test (new wall motion dyssynergy with dipyridamole) and they formed group 1. Eight patients had a negative echocardiography test (group 2). During baseline conditions, no significant differences were found in the 2 groups: rate pressure product (107 +/- 16 vs 108 +/- 13 mm Hg x beats/min x 1/100), positive left ventricular (LV) dP/dt (1,950 +/- 473 vs 2,262 +/- 430 mm Hg/s), negative LV dP/dt (-2,069 +/- 620 vs -2,205 +/- 245), LV end-diastolic pressure (8.2 +/- 4.4 vs 9.6 +/- 4.0 mm Hg), right ventricular positive dP/dt (368 +/- 133 vs 400 +/- 190 mm Hg/s) and negative dP/dt (-281 +/- 89 vs -383 +/- 147). At peak dipyridamole, the 2 groups were different for LV end-diastolic pressure (20 +/- 10 vs 8 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), LV positive dP/dt (2,100 +/- 688 vs 3,013 +/- 851 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.01) and negative dP/dt (-1,868 +/- 518 vs -2,564 +/- 272, p less than 0.01). At peak ischemia, LV positive dP/dt increased slightly, but not significantly, while negative dP/dt decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) in comparison with resting values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This prospective, randomized evaluation of electrode polarity on defibrillation thresholds was performed in 21 survivors of ventricular fibrillation (VF) undergoing cardiac surgery. Defibrillation was always performed with 2 identical large rectangular, wire mesh electrodes positioned over the anterior wall of the right ventricle and the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle. The initial electrode polarity for the left ventricular (LV) electrode was chosen randomly for determination of the defibrillation threshold. Subsequently, electrode polarity was reversed. The defibrillation threshold was defined as the lowest pulse amplitude that would effectively terminate VF with a single discharge delivered 10 seconds after initiation of an episode of VF with alternating current. For each defibrillation pulse, voltage, current, resistance and delivered energy were recorded. Of the 21 patients, 15 (71%) had a lower defibrillation threshold when the LV electrode was positive, 2 patients (10%) had a lower defibrillation threshold when the LV electrode was negative and 4 patients (19%) had equal defibrillation thresholds (within 0.5 J) regardless of polarity. The mean leading edge defibrillation threshold voltage was 370 +/- 88 volts when the LV electrode was negative and 320 +/- 109 volts (14% less) when the LV electrode was positive (p = 0.014). Mean leading edge defibrillation threshold current was 9.3 +/- 3.1 amps when the LV electrode was negative compared to 7.7 +/- 3.1 amps (17% less) when the LV electrode was positive (p = 0.0033). There were no differences in resistance with the 2 configurations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using transesophageal recording techniques, tachycardia cycle length, AV intervals and ventriculoatrial intervals were measured before and after drug administration. Both intravenous propranolol and verapamil significantly prolonged tachycardia cycle length and AV interval (cycle length--propranolol 230 +/- 30 to 262 +/- 33 ms, p less than 0.05, verapamil 223 +/- 38 to 245 +/- 32 ms, p less than 0.05; AV interval--propranolol 98 +/- 26 to 126 +/- 38 ms, p less than 0.05, verapamil 96 +/- 19 to 109 +/- 24 ms, p less than 0.05). Neither drug prolonged the ventriculoatrial interval. Tachycardia terminated after intravenous verapamil in 11 of 14 infants (79% efficacy rate). Tachycardia terminated in 0 of 18 after intravenous propranolol (0% efficacy rate). In 8 infants an atrial deflection was recorded on the esophageal electrocardiogram at the time of tachycardia termination after intravenous verapamil, which suggested that tachycardia terminated by block occurring in the AV node. In 2 infants a ventricular deflection was recorded at the time of tachycardia termination after verapamil, which suggested that block occurred in the accessory connection. Both drugs prolonged tachycardia cycle length by prolonging AV conduction to a similar degree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The goal was to determine the utility of these devices by trained lay persons in actual cardiac arrest episodes. Ninety-seven survivors of out-of-hospital VF were enrolled in the study; 59 patients received AEDs, and 38 patients served as a control group. During the study period, 7 deaths occurred in the hospital without preceding out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or from noncardiac causes. There were 14 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 10 in the AED group and 4 in the control group. There was 1 long-term survivor in the control group. In the AED group, among the 10 cardiac arrests for which the device was available, it was used in 6. Only 2 patients were in VF; 1 was resuscitated with residual neurologic deficits and survived several months. This study observed a small potential for AEDs to save high risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "Sustained ventricular arrhythmia is a well-recognized complication of cardiac catheterization, often occurring after selective coronary artery injection of contrast medium. The role of autonomic reflexes in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is unclear. Although the muscarinic antagonist atropine is often administered prophylactically before coronary angiography to reduce the likelihood of sinus bradycardia and vasovagal reactions, its influence on ventricular arrhythmias in this setting has not been established. This case-control trial studied 648 patients undergoing coronary arteriography to investigate this issue. Eleven case subjects (those with ventricular tachyarrhythmia) were identified. Control subjects (those without ventricular tachyarrhythmia) were matched for baseline heart rate (+/- 6 beats/min), age (+/- 10 years), sex and calendar year of procedure using a 1:3 sampling ratio. All 26 potential clinical, anatomic and hemodynamic covariates were statistically similar between groups. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were more likely to occur after selective right coronary injection (odds ratio 15.1, p = 0.0008) but not after multiple contrast injections (odds ratio 0.918, difference not significant). Most importantly, atropine sulfate was administered prophylactically to 18 of 33 control subjects (55 +/- 9%) but only 1 of 11 cases (9 +/- 9%), generating a significant odds ratio of 12.0 (p = 0.02). Thus, the odds of experiencing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias during coronary arteriography may potentially be reduced 12-fold by prior administration of atropine, even in patients with normal baseline heart rates.\r"

All diagnostic cardiac catheterizations were performed 1 week before the exercise tests and the mean LV ejection fraction was 0.30 +/- 0.07. All patients performed graded treadmill exercise tests according to the Sheffield protocol. The relation between supine resting hemodynamic measurements did not correlate with exercise duration. Only resting cardiac output (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.51, p less than 0.05) correlated weakly with exercise duration. However, arterial oxygen transport was highly related to exercise duration (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001) and peak oxygen consumption (r = 0.71, p less than 0.001). Thus, knowledge of calculated arterial oxygen transport can predict exercise capacity in patients with chronic LV dysfunction.\r"

Fourteen (7%) patients were lost to follow-up. Compared with the control group, patients with MAC had higher frequency of precordial murmurs (p less than 0.0001), cardiomegaly (p less than 0.0001), left atrial enlargement (p less than 0.0001), and rhythm and conduction disturbances (p less than 0.0001). During the follow-up, patients with MAC had higher incidence of valve replacement (p less than 0.0025), permanent pacemaker implantation (p less than 0.0025), congestive heart failure (p less than 0.0001), thromboembolic cerebrovascular event (p less than 0.01), sudden death (p less than 0.001) and total cardiac death (p less than 0.0001). However, the frequencies of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery and angioplasty, endocarditis or noncardiac death were not significantly different between patients with MAC and the control subjects. Thus, patients with MAC have higher frequencies of precordial murmurs, cardiomegaly, left atrial and ventricular enlargement, rhythm and conduction disturbances. They more frequently undergo valve replacement and permanent pacemaker implantation, develop congestive heart failure and die of cardiac causes than age- and sex-matched control subjects.\r"

The clinical diagnosis in all cases was probable rheumatic heart disease. Filiform processes (Lambl's excrescences) were seen on 15 of 23 (65%) of these leaflets. Some of these processes appeared to develop when either bundles of collagen or elastic fibers in the connective tissue framework of the cusp were broken. The freed portion of the fiber then served as a nidus for thrombus formation. The endothelium on the surface of the leaflets was consistently altered. Endothelial cells were changed in shape, had microvilli scattered over their exterior, showed discontinuous cell borders and were desquamated, either singly or in groups. Elements of the peripheral blood adhered to the exposed subendothelium. Erythrocytes were usually entrapped in fibrin networks. Single activated platelets and platelet aggregates adhered to the fibers of the exposed subendothelial connective tissue. Surface mineral deposits were composed of granular spherulites, which contained both calcium and phosphorous. This study extends our understanding of the architectural modifications that contribute to the continuing pathologic process of rheumatic mitral valve disease.\r"

Ioxaglate meglumine sodium, an ionic dimer contrast medium, was compared with iopamidol, a nonionic compound. Of the 30 patients who received ioxaglate, 13 (43%) experienced a mild to moderate adverse reaction to the contrast media, while only 2 of the 30 patients (7%) in the iopamidol group had similar side effects (p less than 0.005). Significant prolongations of the QT intervals occurred with the ioxaglate injections. The QT intervals increased from 402 +/- 46 to 442 +/- 59 ms (p less than 0.001) with the right coronary artery injection and similar changes were observed after the left coronary artery injection and left ventriculography. Significant ST-segment and T-wave amplitude changes also occurred in the ioxaglate group. With iopamidol injections, there were no significant changes in any of these parameters. After the left ventriculogram, there were similar decreases in the systolic arterial pressures in both groups (-14 +/- 10 mm Hg with ioxaglate and -21 +/- 9 mm Hg with iopamidol). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressures increased after the ventriculogram in both groups (5 +/- 5 vs 2 +/- 3 mm Hg with ioxaglate and iopamidol, respectively, 60 seconds after the injection). This report demonstrates that mild to moderate adverse reactions, QT-interval prolongations, ST and T-wave changes were significantly greater during coronary angiography with ioxaglate when compared with iopamidol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Suprailiac and subscapular skinfold thickness decreased over 6 mo (p less than 0.01) with the suprailiac region reflecting a significant feeding-method effect.

In only four trials were attempts made to balance fatty acid intakes of control and experimental groups. There is no evidence for a specific effect of lecithin on serum cholesterol independent of its linoleic acid content or secondary changes in food intake. The observed lecithin-induced hypocholesterolemic effects found in various studies were artifacts caused by the design and the manner of data analysis, were mediated by other dietary changes, or were due to the linoleic acid present in lecithin.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the suitability of the linoleic-oleic acid ratio (L:O) of serum cholesteryl esters and erythrocyte membranes as indicators of dietary fatty acid composition. Forty-seven volunteers received a mixed natural diet with a polyunsaturated-saturated fatty acids ratio (P:S) of 0.2 for 3 wk and with P:S 2.0 for another 3 wk (HA group, 24 subjects) or vice versa (HY group, 23 subjects). Duplicate portion analysis revealed that dietary fat type was the only variable. The change in L:O in cholesteryl esters relative to the low P:S diet was 91.3 +/- 25.9% (means +/- SD) in the HA group and 85.1 +/- 18.8% in the HY group. The changes in erythrocyte membranes were 33.0 +/- 7.9% in the HA group and 22.8 +/- 4.9% in the HY group. Thus the effect on erythrocyte fatty acids was smaller but also less variable and the precision of the two measures was similar. Therefore the L:O of either blood component can be used as a marker of a subject's adherence to experimental diets differing in type of fat.\r"

  ".W": "alpha-Linolenic acid deficiency is described in three patients. Observed clinical symptoms were hemorrhagic dermatitis, hemorrhagic folliculitis, skin atrophy, and scaly dermatitis. Supplementation with ethyl alpha-linolenate followed by a purified fish oil (EPA-oil) began to normalize symptoms within 10 d. The mitogenic response in isolated lymphocytes was reduced whereas the number of T lymphocytes increased significantly. Serum thromboxanes, urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGI2-M), and bleeding time were unaffected. The results indicate that omega-3 fatty acids are essential for normal accumulation of erythrocyte omega-6 acids. The dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 acids required to obtain midnormal concentrations of omega-3 acids in plasma and erythrocyte lipids was estimated to be 350-400 mg/d (0.4% of calories), whereas the corresponding mean intake of alpha-linolenic acid was 990 mg/d (1.0% of calories). It is suggested that essential fatty acid requirement should be stated as grams or milligrams per day, similarly to other essential nutrients.\r"

A 24-h cell exposure to linoleic but not linolenic acid resulted in a concentration dependent and largely reversible increase in albumin transfer. Both fatty acids and in particular linolenic acid incorporated into cellular phospholipids. In contrast, only supplementation with linoleic but not linolenic acid resulted in an increased incorporation of this fatty acid into cell triglycerides. Similarly, only total cell triglyceride content increased after incubation with linoleic- but not with linolenic-enriched media. These results indicate that cellular enrichment with linoleic but not linolenic acid causes cellular perturbations that may be implicated in atherosclerosis.\r"

The sample correlation coefficient (r) was 0.84 between oral and intravenous fat-tolerance tests, 0.84 between the oral fat-tolerance test and the duodenal-perfusion method, and 0.82 between the intravenous fat-tolerance and the duodenal perfusion methods. All three methods showed a strong correlation between chylomicron-triglyceride clearance and fasting triglyceride concentrations.

We determined the half-life and fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of plasma fibronectin in the premature infant. Infants and adults received a loading dose of [15N]glycine followed by a constant infusion [15N]glycine incorporation into plasma fibronectin and urine hippurate was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma fibronectin FSR in the preterm neonates was 15.5 +/- 9.9%/d(means +/- SD) and the half-life was 5.55 +/- 2.25 d. Birth weight correlated inversely with plasma fibronectin half-life. In the adults the plasma fibronectin FSR ranged from 20 to 87%/d and half-life ranged between 0.79 and 3.47 d. These data suggest that decreased plasma fibronectin levels in preterm infants are due to reduced FSRs rather than to greater turnover of a relatively small plasma pool.\r"

However, energy requirement was positively associated with lean mass (p less than 0.0001) whereas fat mass added no predictive value to the same multivariate regression equation. Self-reported energy intake (before the experiments) was not correlated with lean mass and was underestimated by lean subjects at least as much as by obese subjects. Discrepant findings in the literature concerning relationships between obesity and energy intake may be explained by reporting error and by the relative lean mass of obese vs nonobese women but not by systematic underreporting unique to obese subjects.\r"

Rate and amount of weight loss, serum ketones, and N balance were not different between groups. However, the subjects in group 2 (MCT) demonstrated an increase in glucose requirement to maintain euglycemia during the clamp after weight loss (delta 0.18 +/- 0.13 mmol.m-2.min-1) whereas subjects in group 1 (LCT) had a diminished requirement (delta -0.12 +/- 0.10, p = 0.036).

The smears tended to hypercellularity, and nuclei were often slightly enlarged with pale chromatin, intranuclear holes, and longitudinal grooving of the nuclear membrane. On the other hand, some cytologic features were more suggestive of medullary carcinoma--poor cohesion of cells with elongated and spindle cell forms and hyaline acellular areas. Awareness of the histologic and cytologic features of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma may enable the cytopathologist to avoid a false positive diagnosis of papillary carcinoma or medullary carcinoma, although it is unrealistic to expect a definitive diagnosis of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma.\r"

Recognition of tubular pattern is generally easy. Discrimination between cribriform and solid types leaves some margin for the pathologist's subjective interpretation because it is essentially based on the amount of gland-like spaces, containing mucinous or hyalinized material, which are present in neoplastic nests. To overcome this problem and with the aim of identifying a more objective basis for prognostic evaluation of cribriform and solid ACC, the authors counted the number of gland-like spaces per square millimeter of tumor, excluding supporting stroma and small areas with the tubular pattern, in a group of tumors similar with regard to therapy, stage of disease, and microscopic evidence of tumor-free surgical margins. According to the authors' data, the number of gland-like spaces per square millimeter of tumor appears to be a reliable and objective measure for prognostic evaluation of cribriform and solid pattern ACC; in particular, the greater the number of gland-like spaces per square millimeter of tumor, the longer the survival of the patient.\r"

WB aggregation induced by collagen was significantly higher in patients with IHD and in diabetic patients than in controls (P less than 0.01), whereas diluted WB and PRP aggregation were not statistically different from controls either in patients with IHD or in diabetic patients.

Three of eight subjects showed temporally closely coordinated and maintained increases of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein-A, total apolipoprotein-A, and the ratio of high-density to low-density cholesterols. Changes of other lipids in these three subjects, and lipid changes in the other subjects, were much less dramatic, fell within the range of intrinsic random variation or statistical uncertainty, and showed no significant trends. The results suggest that elevation of high-density lipoproteins in response to ingestion of megadoses of vitamin E is very much an individual characteristic and not uniformly typical of the population at large. The findings complement published examples of individual variation of response to vitamin E as an explanation of disagreements between other reports.\r"

This process seems to account for the formation of focal urate deposits up to some 1.5-2 mm in diameter. The corona then commonly disappears and adjacent deposits may fuse.

  ".W": "Mechanical pump systems for the delivery of intravenous solutions have been used for the transfusion of red blood cells. In this study, the IVAC Variable Pressure Volumetric Pump Model 560 was evaluated for that purpose using flow rates of 70 mL/hour and 999 mL/hour through 16-, 19-, and 23-gauge needles and an 18-gauge angiocatheter. The largest degree of hemolysis induced by the delivery system resulted in a mean increase of plasma hemoglobin of 150 mg/L (15 mg/dL); this is equivalent to the loss of 0.03% of the red blood cells. When programmed to deliver 15 mL of red blood cells, the IVAC 560 delivered 15.0 +/- 0.3 mL at a rate of 70 mL/hour and 14.9 +/- 0.3 mL at 999 mL/hour. The authors conclude that the IVAC 560 can be used to deliver red blood cells with a minimal, acceptable level of hemolysis. It also delivers an accurate and precise volume of red blood cells that may be an aid to the transfusionist.\r"

After equilibration, patients were randomly assigned to two periods of four days each on either a high-protein diet (HPD) or a low-protein diet (LPD), with energy intakes remaining the same during both periods. High protein intake resulted in significantly higher mean (+/- SD) daily creatinine excretion and clearance rates. The HPD was associated with significantly increased excretion rates of potassium, phosphate, sulfate, and calcium. Net acid excretion with the HPD was nearly threefold higher than that observed with the LPD. These differences were unassociated with urinary pH, which remained similar with both diets. We conclude that different protein intakes affect urinary excretion of creatinine, potassium, phosphate, sulfate, calcium, and net acid.\r"

Of the remainder, 282 were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and 61 were small for gestational age (SGA). Over 80% of both AGA and SGA infants were inborn and were evaluated within three hours of delivery. Nucleated red blood cell counts were significantly increased in SGA infants compared with AGA infants. The percent of infants with NRBC counts higher than 4.0 and 10.0 x 10(9)/L were 48% and 26%, respectively, in SGA infants compared with 19% and 6%, respectively, in AGA infants. Similarly, the percent of SGA infants with more than 40 or 100 NRBCs per 100 white blood cells were 62% and 36%, respectively, compared with 25% and 6%, respectively, in AGA infants. Data for specific weeks of gestation are provided and the differences were present at each gestational age. Recent data in fetuses with growth retardation, when blood was obtained directly from the fetal umbilical vein, showed an association between elevated NRBC counts and chronic hypoxemia. When increased NRBC counts are seen soon after birth, the possibility of a chronic intrauterine insult should be considered.\r"

In the six patients in group 1, puberty began at an early bone age. Pubertal changes progressed rapidly and the bone age advanced faster than chronologic time so that, despite a normal to increased growth rate, growth potential was lost. Group 2 comprised three patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies but without gonadotropin deficiency who had the timing and progression of puberty expected in hypopituitarism. The four patients in group 3, all with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, had gonadotropin deficiency requiring sex steroid replacement.\r"

Compared with 51 other children with parietal skull fracture and normal CT scans, the clinical characteristics significantly associated with the presence of an intracranial lesion were symptoms of neurologic dysfunction (loss or altered level of consciousness and/or seizure activity), neurologic compromise on examination (altered level of consciousness and/or focal deficit), or complicated skull fracture (bilateral, diastatic, and/or depressed). Of the 47 children with an intracranial lesion on CT scan, 44 had at least one of these significant clinical characteristics (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 50%; positive-predictive value, 62%; and negative-predictive value, 96%). Children who sustain traumatic parietal skull fracture commonly experience associated intracranial injury. Those with evidence of neurologic deficit or complicated skull fracture are at particularly high risk, and should receive cranial CT scan evaluation.\r"

The hematologic and iron status of 30 high school swimmers was assessed at the beginning and end of a competitive swim season. Iron depletion (serum ferritin level less than 12 micrograms/L) was initially present in 46.7% of the girls and none of the boys, yet among those subjects with hypoferritinemia there was no evidence of impaired red blood cell production. Serum haptoglobin levels were normal and did not correlate with serum ferritin levels. No significant change was observed in ferritin, hemoglobin, or haptoglobin concentrations during the course of the season. Dietary intake of iron was poor, particularly in the girls, in whom it averaged 43% of the recommended dietary allowance. Menstrual histories suggested an inverse relationship between the amount of menstrual flow and the serum ferritin level. These findings indicate a high prevalence of nonanemic iron deficiency in female high school swimmers that bears no relationship to swim training. Dietary inadequacies and menstrual blood flow appear to be important contributors to the hypoferritinemia observed in these athletes.\r"

All diagnoses of SCD were made at birth by means of screening blood from the umbilical cord. The children were prospectively followed up from birth to 4 years of age. Severe bacterial infections occurred in none of the children with SCD; one of the control children developed pneumococcal meningitis. Acute gastroenteritis was significantly more common among patients with SCD. For the first year of life, patients with SCD had significantly more infections than did the control children; but the reverse was true in the group that was 37 to 48 months of age. Considering all types of infections for all age groups, no difference was noted between patients with SCD and control subjects in terms of infection rate or related hospital admission. There were no deaths caused by infection in this series. We conclude that Saudi Arabian infants and young children of oasis origin with SCD are not at increased risk of infections compared with healthy children of the same age.\r"

Significant reductions in the numbers of emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and short courses of prednisone therapy occurred when home nebulizer therapy was provided. The younger the patients, the more frequently improvement occurred. After the initiation of home nebulizer therapy there was no change in the severity of illness when patients presented to the emergency department or in the number of episodes of respiratory failure. Home nebulizer therapy for children with asthma appears safe and reduces the need for hospital care and short courses of prednisone therapy.\r"

This study was performed to validate these data and to determine if the cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance responses to exercise are different in a biracial population of 10-year-old boys. Nineteen blacks and 31 whites underwent maximum supine graded exercise tests with Doppler determination of cardiac output and measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. The blacks had a body surface area that was marginally larger than that of the whites, but no differences were noted in height or weight. Working capacities, when indexed by weight, were virtually identical between the two groups. No differences were noted in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure during preexercise, maximum exercise, or early and late recovery. White males had significantly higher cardiac indexes during preexercise, maximum exercise, and early and late recovery. Black males had greater systemic vascular resistance during preexercise, maximum exercise, and early and late recovery. Thus, the black children's blood pressure responses to exercise were comparable with those of the white children but they had a greater systemic vascular resistance and lower cardiac index. These racial differences may serve as potential markers for the prehypertensive state.\r"

In the latter five years compared with the first five years, increasing resources allowed proportionately more VLBW infants to be offered assisted ventilation, and the patient-days of assisted ventilation consumed per live birth rose by almost 60%. All VLBW infants did not benefit equally from the increased assisted ventilation. Mortality in infants with birth weights below 1200 g decreased; unexpectedly, mortality in larger VLBW infants (birth weights, 1200 g to 1499 g) rose (relative odds, 3.11; 95% confidence intervals, 1.21 to 7.99). Despite the increased consumption of ventilator resources, there was no substantial impact on overall mortality in VLBW infants.\r"

However, studies have lacked consistent criteria for assessment, and jet ventilation systems have varied widely. We compared autopsy and histopathologic findings in six neonates who died after prolonged jet ventilatory support with findings in six matched controls who died after receiving conventional ventilatory support. Jet ventilation consisted of a pressure-limited, time-cycled, flow-interrupter-type system. The airways of all patients were assessed by the histopathologic scoring system of Ophoven et al. No differences were observed between neonates who received jet ventilation or conventional ventilation. We believe that the risk of airway damage should not preclude the use of jet ventilation, although further monitoring is imperative.\r"

We investigated an increase in hospitalizations of children less than 2 years old for severe lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) from October 1986 through December 1986 on the island of American Samoa. Hospitalization rates were highest in children less than 6 months of age (60 of 1000 compared with 22 of 1000 for those 6 to 11 months of age, and seven of 1000 for those 12 to 24 months of age). The outbreak was more severe than in previous years, with ten (19%) of 54 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with three (7%) of 42 and one (3%) of 40 during the same months of 1985 and 1984. Two patients died. Most patients had clinical bronchiolitis; of 34 patients tested, serologic or nasal aspirate evidence of recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was found in 18 (53%). A study of patients younger than 1 year of age demonstrated that patients hospitalized with LRI were more likely to have a household member who smoked cigarettes (18/20, 90%) than outpatient controls without recent respiratory illness (8/15, 53%). Maternal sera obtained between December 1985 and October 1986 showed no protective effect of either detectable IgG or neutralizing antibody to two major groups of RSV. Our study documents the involvement of RSV in an outbreak of severe LRI among infants in a tropical area and further suggests that exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for LRI infants.\r"

To avoid the biases inherent in such designs, we studied recurrent injuries in a school district population, utilizing a prospective surveillance system to identify injuries meeting standardized criteria. During three school years we observed 54,874 students, ranging in age from 6 to 18 years, for recurrent injuries, which were defined as those occurring in a year in which two or more injuries were reported for the child. Five hundred seventy-three recurrently injured children (1% of the school district population) sustained 1405 injuries (17% of the overall injury experience), a proportion significantly but only slightly greater than that expected on the basis of chance alone (14%). Most recurrently injured children were injured in only a single year, with only 15 children sustaining injuries in all three study years. Age, sex, and type of school were significant correlates of recurrent injury rates, with junior high school students, boys, and students attending schools with alternative educational programs having the highest rates of injury recurrence. The findings indicate that (1) a small group of schoolchildren sustain a disproportionate share of the overall injury experience, (2) the majority of recurrently injured children experience only transient periods of enhanced injury risk, and (3) preventive strategies may benefit from investigation of developmental and social environmental factors that alter such risk.\r"

Oxygen was prescribed to maintain arterial oxygen saturation at 95% or greater. At discharge, postconceptional age was 40.5 +/- 0.6 weeks, and weight was 2220 +/- 50 g. Duration of home oxygen therapy was 4.5 +/- 0.5 months. The mean weight percentile increased from less than 5 to 23 between discharge and the last follow-up. All infants survived; only 6 required hospitalization for acute medical illnesses. We conclude that carefully supervised home oxygen therapy permits the safe early discharge of selected extremely low-birth-weight infants with chronic lung disease.\r"

Cardiac referral and diagnosis were accomplished by 13 weeks of age in 78% of infants with DS and 67% of those with ICMs. However, by 26 weeks of age, the proportion of infants in both groups was comparable. Cardiac surgery was performed before 1 year of age in 99 of 160 infants with DS and in 141 of 540 infants with ICMs. The surgical outcome was similar in the two groups. We conclude that for defects of comparable severity, the pattern of cardiac care in the Baltimore-Washington, DC, area for infants with DS is timely and comparable to care for infants with ICMs.\r"

Patient 1 was a 15-year-old girl with panhypopituitarism but intact posterior pituitary function. Computed tomography disclosed widening of the superior aspect of the pituitary stalk and a partially empty sella. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a 3-mm high-intensity signal abutting the optic tract in the midline just above the sella. The pituitary stalk was not clearly defined, the pituitary gland was small, and the sella was filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Patient 2 was a 12-year-old boy with isolated deficiency of growth hormone secretion. Findings from magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were similar to those in patient 1. These data suggest that the high-intensity magnetic resonance imaging findings represent a displaced or \"ectopic\" posterior pituitary gland, and that the hypopituitary state is due to an insult to the pituitary stalk.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the potential side effects of theophylline on behavior, attention, memory, and fine motor function in children with asthma. Seventeen children of normal intelligence who were intermittent theophylline users were recruited. Each was not taking medication at the initiation of the study. During the study, each child took the study medication (Theo-Dur tablets, 14 to 16 mg/kg per day or their usual dose, whichever was higher, or placebo) divided every 12 hours for 3 1/2 days (seven doses). A double-blind crossover design was employed such that each subject was randomly assigned to a group receiving theophylline/placebo or placebo/theophylline. After the first period, subjects were tested on a neuropsychological battery designed to assess cognitive performance, while the children, parents, and teachers filled out questionnaires concerning behavior and attention. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later (period 2) under the opposite drug condition. Data were analyzed by means of an analysis of variance, with time (period 1 vs period 2 [performance]) as a repeated measure and medication group as a between-subjects factor. Dependent variables consisted of 27 measures of performance, behavior, and attention. Only one of the 27 analyses revealed a significant group by time interaction. This analysis suggested a significant improvement in memory while taking theophylline; however, a different form of the same test showed no effect. Children and parents also completed a side-effects scale under both drug conditions. When the children were taking theophylline, parents and children noted that the children had more stomachaches and children noted more \"shaking hands.\" The following observations suggest that the failure to find significant behavioral side effects while taking theophylline is not due to the relatively small sample size: (1) Almost all of the analyses fell far short of statistical significance, with findings indicating no trends toward poor performance while taking medication. (2) Correlations between the theophylline level and change in performance clustered around zero, with positive and negative values occurring with about equal frequency. (3) Neither parents nor children could accurately guess the child's medication condition. Thus, although there have been numerous reports on the behavioral side effects of theophylline, such reactions were not revealed in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperplastic colonic polyps are generally regarded as being of little or no clinical consequence. Recently, however, hyperplastic polyps have been found to share numerous functional similarities with colorectal carcinoma. To determine whether the presence of an isolated left-sided colonic hyperplastic (metaplastic) polyp could serve as a marker for more proximal synchronous adenomatous colonic polyps, we retrospectively analyzed all consecutive colonoscopic polypectomies performed over an 18-month period at two medical centers. It is the policy at both institutions to remove or biopsy all polyps, regardless of size. Indications for colonoscopy included known or previous colonic polyps or carcinoma, hemoccult positive stool, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, abnormal barium enema, inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal pain, and family history of colon cancer. The location of adenomatous polyps and hyperplastic polyps was recorded and compared. One hundred sixty-three of 845 consecutive patients (19.3%) had at least one colonic polyp. The prevalence of adenomatous polyps alone was 10.3%, hyperplastic polyps 9%, and both types 1.9%. The prevalence rate for an adenomatous polyp in patients without a hyperplastic polyp was 15%. In contrast, among patients with a hyperplastic polyp, 49% had a synchronous adenomatous polyp. Only 3.4% of patients had an adenomatous polyp proximal to the splenic flexure when no polyps were present in the left colon. Conversely, among the 29 patients in whom an isolated hyperplastic polyp was found in the left colon, there was a 32.5% prevalence of adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon (p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that left-sided hyperplastic colonic polyps (generally within the reach of a screening sigmoidoscopy) serve as a marker for neoplastic polyps.\r"

For these reasons, we investigated proximal and distal colonic motor responses to food ingestion in a rather large group of healthy subjects. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers were studied with a colonoscopically positioned multilumen manometric probe and low-compliance infusion system. Recordings were obtained for 2 h during fasting and for 3 h after the subjects had eaten a 1000-kcal standard mixed meal. During fasting, motility was quite low, and no significant differences between proximal and distal portions were seen. After eating, each portion significantly increased its motor activity throughout the subsequent recording period, but there were differences in the time course in the response to eating for different colonic segments. Proximal portions (especially the transverse colon) had first a sudden maximal increase and then a decrease, whereas the distal ones had a slower and more sustained increase in activity. These findings are of interest, especially for comparison with those of patients with suspected motor dysfunction of the large bowel.\r"

To clarify this issue, colonic transit studies using radiopaque markers were performed on 10 women in the follicular phase, 10 women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and five women on oral contraceptives, and the results were compared with transit times in 11 male controls. No significant differences in colonic transit were found between either phase of the menstrual cycle. Colonic transit in women was slower than in men, but this was not statistically significant. In the clinical setting, therefore, colonic transit studies can be performed throughout the menstrual cycle or when taking oral contraceptives. In addition, a single standard for normal values can be used for both men and women.\r"

Colonic transit scintigraphy was used to evaluate 23 constipated patients. After oral passage of a tube to the cecum, 50 microCi of 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaaceticacid (111In-DTPA) were instilled, and abdominal images were obtained for 48 h with a gamma camera. The 95% confidence limit for the geometric center in normals at 24 h was used as a criterion to differentiate patients with colonic inertia from those with functional rectosigmoid obstruction. In patients with functional rectosigmoid obstruction, colonic transit was essentially normal. In colonic inertia, transit was delayed in the cecum and ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon. These two distinct patterns of colonic transit may have different pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.\r"

Antral biopsies from 160 endoscopies were evaluated for the presence of CP; four tests readily available to the practicing endoscopist were used: two urease tests [CLOtest and microtiter biopsy urease test (MBUT)], hematoxylin and eosin staining, and culture. Sensitivity and specificity of each was evaluated and found to be near 90%, except for culture, which was less sensitive. The presence of peptic disease on endoscopy, and age greater than 50 yr, did play a small role in the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. With the advantage of lower cost, ease, and rapidity of performance, either the CLOtest or MBUT is recommended for the standard endoscopic evaluation for CP.\r"

Gastric lesions were induced by 50% ethanol, and all kinds of PGs were significantly decreased 1 h after administration, concomitantly. Thirty percent ethanol did not induce gastric lesions and had no effects on PG levels. Five percent ethanol significantly increased 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, and PGE2 levels. Ten percent ethanol increased significantly PGD2 level. Premedication with sucralfate protected significantly gastric mucosa against 50% ethanol, and maintained PG levels, concomitantly. We also investigated the recovery time course of gastric lesions by 50% ethanol. Gastric lesions did not recover significantly after 24 h, recovered considerably after 48 h, and fully after 96 h. Levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, and PGE2 were fully recovered 24 h after exposure to 50% ethanol; however, a significant decrease in PGD2 level still was observed. PGD2 was recovered significantly after 48 h. These results indicate that different concentrations of ethanol induce different effects on gastric mucosal PGs, and that not only PGE2, but also other PGs, especially PGD2, might be linked with the genesis and recovery of gastric lesions by 50% ethanol.\r"

Because the relationship between the infection in both sites is not well known, we submitted to routine upper digestive endoscopy 57 patients with AIDS. Furthermore, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of oral candidiasis and esophageal symptoms as markers of Candida esophagitis. Oral and esophageal candidiasis were found in 52% and 48% of patients, respectively, whereas symptoms of esophageal origin were referred to by 60% of patients successively documented to have an esophageal infection. The sensitivity of esophageal symptoms and oral candidiasis alone, as indexes of an esophageal infection, was 60% and 88%, and their specificity was 100% and 81%, respectively. The combination of these two parameters improved their degree of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 93%, and specificity 100%), whereas the predictive value of their simultaneous presence or absence was 100% and 96%, respectively. These results document that routine endoscopy to verify the presence of esophageal candidiasis in all of the patients with AIDS is unnecessary; it could be reserved for selected subgroups such as those with esophageal symptoms despite systemic antifungal treatment, and for patients with AIDS-related complex presenting oral candidiasis without symptoms of esophageal origin.\r"

Nonacetylated salicylates reportedly cause less reduction in renal prostaglandins than do aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. To determine whether nonacetylated salicylates affect renal function, we compared diflunisal with indomethacin in nine patients with cirrhosis and ascites. One 50-mg dose of indomethacin reduced inulin clearance (91 +/- 11 to 76 +/- 11 ml/min) and blunted furosemide-stimulated natriuresis (58 +/- 12 to 36 +/- 9 mEq/h) and diuresis (1103 +/- 148 to 809 +/- 170 ml/h, all p less than 0.05). Three doses of diflunisal had no effect on inulin clearance (94 +/- 16 ml/min), natriuresis (60 +/- 12 ml/h), or diuresis (1041 +/- 112). Indomethacin caused greater reduction in urinary prostaglandin E2 (50% vs. 10%) and in serum thromboxane (94% vs. 80%) than diflunisal (p less than 0.05). Thus, nonacetylated salicylates avoid renal impairment and may be the preferred nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.\r"

Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) indicated that verbal ability was preserved in all cirrhotics. Of the WAIS performance tests, block design test (BDT) was abnormal in 11 (55%), picture arrangement in 10 (50%), object assembly in eight (40%) and digit symbol in six (30%) patients. Taken together, these tests diagnosed SHE in 14 (70%) patients. Number connection test (NCT) alone, on the other hand, was abnormal in 13 (65%) patients. A combination of NCT and BDT yielded the diagnosis of SHE in 15 (75%) patients. An important measure of the reliability of the diagnosis of SHE was that NCT and BDT were independently abnormal in 10 of these patients. Both NCT and BDT were found easy and quick to administer. In conclusion, our results argue in favor of using a combination of NCT and BDT for a rapid and accurate diagnosis of SHE in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

Utilizing various esophageal function techniques, the main features observed during hiccups were esophageal body dilation and aperistalsis, absent lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in response to swallowing, poor emptying of the distal two-thirds of the esophageal body, and low distal esophageal pH. Most of these features normalized in the absence of hiccups. A comparison is made of these findings during prolonged hiccups with those of esophageal achalasia.\r"

Acid-related ulceration and obstruction of the proximal gastric pouch after surgery have been well documented, but duodenal ulceration after gastric bypass has yet to be reported. We present the first reported case of duodenal ulceration and perforation after gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity. This case demonstrates that acid-related gastroduodenal disease may occur in the bypassed gastrointestinal tract. Consideration should be given to this area in evaluating upper gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain after gastric bypass. Because barium contrast studies may not adequately evaluate bypassed segments, and standard gastroscopes are not long enough to reach these areas, the use of longer endoscopes may be necessary to confirm the presence of gastroduodenal disease after gastric bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Regional citrate anticoagulation is an alternative to heparin anticoagulation for hemodialysis of patients at increased risk of bleeding. We report the successful use of this technique in 326 dialyses in 49 high bleeding risk patients with acute renal failure. Systemic anticoagulation did not occur as a result of any dialysis procedure, and in no instance was bleeding observed. Dialysis was effective, as judged by removal of creatinine. The safety of this procedure is demonstrated by the lack of bleeding complications and the small incidence of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. In addition we document the absence of citrate intoxication by serial measurements of serum citrate levels. Regional citrate anticoagulation is a safe and effective method of performing hemodialysis in patients with acute renal failure at increased risk of bleeding.\r"

A similar gentamicin-induced decrease in Kf was seen in midterm pregnant (day 12) rats and the normal gestational increase in GFR and SNGFR was blunted by gentamicin. Concomitant converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) (MK 421, 50 mg/L drinking water) completely prevented the gentamicin-induced decrease in Kf in virgin females, thus confirming that the gentamicin-induced decline in Kf is mediated by angiotensin II (ANG II). These studies indicate that pregnancy neither exacerbates nor ameliorates gentamicin-induced glomerulotoxicity and also that glomerular ANG II responsivity is not diminished in midterm pregnant rats.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of thromboxane in systemic sepsis and renal failure, peritonitis was induced surgically in 22 sheep, leading to local and systemic sepsis. A selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, U63,557A (Upjohn Co, Kalamazoo, MI) was given before surgery in five animals and 30 minutes after surgery in five animals. A typical picture of volume-loaded, normotensive, vasodilated septic shock developed in all animals. Twenty four hours after induction of sepsis, the control group showed a marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion. Pretreated animals showed no change in GFR and a smaller reduction in urine volume and sodium excretion. The posttreatment group showed no change in any parameters of renal function. Plasma renin activity, urinary TXB2 excretion, and urinary 6-keto PGF1 alpha excretion increased after 24 hours only in the control group. Urinary TXB2 excretion was reduced by 80% in animals given U63,557A before surgery. The results indicate a significant protective effect of U63,557A on renal function during septic shock, probably related to reduced thromboxane synthesis, with no apparent deleterious systemic effects. The results support a role for thromboxane in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure in systemic sepsis.\r"

In both cases the hyperfiltration has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal functional deterioration. We studied the effect of long-standing hyperfiltration on kidney function in 29 subjects with one kidney, three of whom were insulin-dependent diabetics. Four groups were studied: (1) uninephrectomized less than 10 years since uninephrectomy (UN) (n = 7; age, 30 +/- 6 years); (2) uninephrectomized greater than or equal to 10 years since UN (19 +/- 11 years, 10 to 52); n = 14; age, 38 +/- 15 years; (3) congenital unilateral renal agenesis (n = 5, age, 39 +/- 16 years); and (4) IDDM patients with one kidney (n = 3; age, 28 to 52 years; diabetes duration, 8 to 31 years; years with one kidney, 18 to 30). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured by the constant infusion technique, kidney volume (KV) by ultrasonic scanning, and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) by radioimmunoassay. In all subjects GFR, RPF, and KV were within the normal range, representing a single kidney hyperfiltration of approximately 70% and hypertrophy of approximately 100%. Only one of the subjects with renal agenesis had an elevated UAE (117 micrograms/min); the remainder had a normal UAE, ie, less than 10 micrograms/min, and the diabetics were below the risk level of 20 micrograms/min. Serum creatinine was normal and BP was slightly elevated in only three subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All were treated with hemodialysis three times per week. Dialysates with potassium concentrations of 2 mEq/L, 1 mEq/L, or 0 mEq/L were compared. Each patient (exceptions noted in text) was studied once at each bath potassium concentration. Cardiac rhythm was recorded by Holter monitor during and for six hours following dialysis. Single PVCs and APCs were common with all potassium concentrations. Only one patient had high-grade ventricular ectopy. It was seen with each of the three potassium concentrations, but was most severe with the potassium-free dialysate. The potassium-free dialysate removed significantly more potassium (78.5 +/- 2.6 mEq) than the 1-K dialysate (62.9 +/- 5.1 mEq) or the 2-K dialysate (50.6 +/- 6 mEq), and the 1-K dialysate removed significantly more potassium than the 2-K dialysate. There were small but significant differences in serum potassium concentrations with the three different dialysates. It was concluded that (1) in all but one of our patients potassium-free dialysate did not produce new ectopy; (2) potassium-free dialysate was 24% more effective than 1-K dialysate and 50% more effective than 2-K dialysate in removing body potassium; and (3) 1-K dialysate was 20% more effective than 2-K dialysate in removing body potassium.\r"

It has rarely been reported in patients with glomerular disease. Two such patients with secondary HUS are described. A 17-month-old girl with hematuria and the nephrotic syndrome, negative antistreptolycin O (ASO) titer, and low serum levels of C3 and C4 developed oliguria, progressive azotemia, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. A kidney biopsy showed fibrin in glomerular capillaries and cresentic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. A 22-year-old man with a 16-year history of relapsing minimal change nephrotic syndrome had been in remission for 5 years when he experienced nephrotic syndrome relapse and developed thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal failure. A kidney biopsy revealed foot process fusion and obstruction of glomerular capillaries with fibrin and platelets. These cases illustrate that HUS can occur in association with other glomerular diseases and should be considered when thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia occur in a nephritic or nephrotic patient.\r"

  ".W": "Peritoneal dialysis is associated with large losses of protein. In order to quantify thyroid hormone excretion in the dialysate and to examine the possibility that peritoneal dialysis may result in clinical hypothyroidism, nine endstage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or chronic intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) were studied. Total protein excretion in the peritoneal fluid was 21.5 +/- 2.1 g/24 h and did not vary with the mode of peritoneal dialysis. Thyroid binding globulin (TBG) excretion was 6.4 +/- 1.3 mg/24 h, higher than the values reported in the literature for urinary TBG excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. Despite the higher TBG losses, serum TBG remained in the normal range. Mean peritoneal total T4 and T3 were 8.1 +/- 1.6 micrograms/24 h and 89.5 +/- 14.6 ng/24 h, and there was a significant correlation between peritoneal T4 and TBG (r = 0.69; P less than 0.01) and between peritoneal total proteins and T4 (r = 0.80; P less than 0.001). Despite the finding that large amounts of protein are lost in peritoneal fluid, T4 and T3 losses were relatively modest and remained below their daily production rates, and none of the patients were overtly hypothyroid. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was mildly elevated in three of nine patients and was consistent with early thyroid failure. The patients' serum iodine levels were higher than normal but did not predict the patients' thyroid status. We conclude that major protein losses could predispose patients undergoing CAPD to thyroid failure and that long-term follow-up of thyroid function is warranted in these patients.\r"

DNA haplotypes with nine polymorphic sites were created in 54 Caucasian families. There is a strong LD between the haplotypes and the presence of the mutant CF genes. This implies that the DNA polymorphisms examined are close to the CF gene and that one mutation of the CF gene predominates in the Caucasian population. Haplotype analysis can also be used to refine estimates of CF carrier risk in Caucasians. Data for XV2c and MET markers in 16 American black patients and their families revealed a different haplotype distribution and LD pattern with the CF locus. These data suggest that racial admixture alone does not explain the occurrence of CF in American blacks and that multiple alleles of the CF gene may exist in this population.\r"

In a North American population, 86% of CF chromosomes occur with a haplotype which occurs on only 14% of normal chromosomes. An individual homozygous for the highest-risk haplotype has an 81-fold greater probability of carrying a CF allele than does an individual homozygous for the lowest-risk haplotype. The linkage-disequilibrium data can be used for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling in CF families. The data are useful in 1-in-4-risk pregnancies when DNA is not available from the propositus and in counseling close relatives of CF families. Serious problems arise with some pregnancies which remain at intermediate risks after analysis, and families are left with difficult decisions. It is not clear that genetic testing for couples at less than 1-in-4 risk is cost-effective or standard care, but use of linkage-disequilibrium data will provide more accurate risk probabilities in a substantial proportion of cases if such testing is carried out. Our results emphasize the need for a specific biological or molecular carrier test. This experience in using linkage-disequilibrium and linkage data in combination for genetic counseling provides a model system for the diagnosis of other disorders.\r"

There are three endogamous subdivisions in this Caucasian genetic isolate. A total of 11 cystic fibrosis (CF) families from Canada and the United States were investigated, including at least two families from each of the three subdivisions, the Dariusleut, Lehrerleut, and Schmiedeleut. A study of RFLPs for the loci D7S8, D7S23, MET, and D7S18 (also called D7S16) in the region of the CF gene in 10 families shows considerable genetic variability. There were three different extended CF gene-region haplotypes on CF chromosomes (CF haplotypes), and there were 13 different extended CF gene-region haplotypes on normal chromosomes (normal haplotypes). The three CF haplotypes have different D7S23 and MET haplotypes. Parents who have the same CF haplotype are, on the average, more closely related than parents who have different haplotypes, but only within the same subdivision. A marriage node graph of 11 families illustrates the complexity of Hutterite genealogies. The frequency distribution of CF haplotypes in the Hutterite sample differs notably from those of larger agglomerates of family data from collaborative studies, with respect to D7S8, MET haplotypes, and D7S23 haplotypes. We propose that there were at least three CF carriers among the founders of the Hutterite population and that copies of a particular CF haplotype in current individuals are identical by descent. The alternative that one or more genetically distinguishable CF haplotypes resulted from recombination since the founding of the population is considered to be less likely.\r"

The mosaicism was confined to the cytotrophoblast and not detected in villous stroma, chorionic plate, or amnion. The percentage of cells with a normal karyotype varied from 12% to 100%, the average being 70%. No such confined mosaicism could be detected in 12 placentas of trisomy 21 fetuses. These findings suggest that a postzygotic loss of a trisomic chromosome in a progenitor cell of trophectoderm facilitates the intrauterine survival of trisomy-13 and -18 conceptuses. They also imply that it is placental function which determines the intrauterine survival and that the mother plays no active role in rejection of trisomic conceptions. The combination of both a pre- and post-zygotic cell division defect in viable trisomy-13 and -18 conceptions points to the possibility of a genetic predisposition to such events. The detection of only a diploid cell line in the cytotrophoblast of some pregnancies with trisomies 13 and 18 also suggests that direct preparation is unreliable for prenatal diagnosis of these trisomies on chorionic villi sampling and that long-term villous culture should be used.\r"

We have measured the apparent Km for pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in fibroblast mitochondria and the heat stability of OAT at 45 degrees C in the presence and absence of PLP, using a sensitive radiochemical assay. The apparent Km for PLP was higher in pyridoxine-responsive patients than in nonresponsive patients whose apparent Km for PLP was normal. In contrast, the apparent Km for ornithine was normal in the seven patients studied. Surprisingly, the responsive patient with mildest clinical disease had the highest Km for PLP. However, she had the most stable enzyme, which presumably contributed to her milder phenotype. Western blot analyses of mitochondrial proteins, using antibody to human OAT, indicated clearly detectable OAT protein in pyridoxine-responsive patients and in two of five nonresponders, but low or undetectable levels in the other three patients. These data clarify the mechanism of pyridoxine response and indicate heterogeneity within as well as between the pyridoxine-responsive and the nonresponsive patients with gyrate atrophy.\r"

The results indicate that an active allele of the OAT gene expresses 50% of the total normal OAT mRNA and activity and that both alleles of the gene are inactive in the patient in this pedigree, a situation resulting in a complete absence of the OAT mRNA, in accordance with the autosomal recessive mechanism of this disease; they also indicate a 50% decrease of OAT mRNA and enzyme activity in obligate heterozygous carriers carrying one defective allele and that these defects are stably inherited.\r"

  ".W": "Mutated cDNA clones containing the entire coding sequence of human glucocerebrosidase were isolated from libraries originated from Gaucher patients. Sequence analysis of a mutated cDNA derived from a type II Gaucher patient revealed a C-to-G transversion causing a substitution of an arginine for a proline at residue 415. This change creates a new cleavage site for the enzyme HhaI in the mutated cDNA. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization made it possible to show that this mutation exists in the genomic DNA of the patient. From a cDNA library originated from a type I Gaucher patient, a mutated allele was cloned that contains a T-to-C transition causing a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 444 and creating a new NciI site. This mutation is identical to that described by S. Tsuji and colleagues in genomic DNA from type I, type II, and type III patients. Since the new NciI site generates RFLP, it was used to test the existence of this mutated allele in several Gaucher patients by Southern blot analysis. This allele was found in type I (Jewish and non-Jewish), type II, and type III Gaucher patients. These findings led us to conclude that the patient suffering from type II disease (denoted GM1260) carried both mutations described above. Any one of the amino acid changes described reduces the glucocerebrosidase activity as tested by transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs. The base changes in the two mutated cDNAs do not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding polypeptides on an SDS polyacrylamide gel.\r"

Most of the 38 patients with type IV glycogen storage disease who are known to us have succumbed at a very early age, with the exception of one male teenager, an apparently healthy 7-year-old male, and several 5-year-old patients. Fourteen pregnancies at risk for branching enzyme deficiency have been monitored using cultured amniotic fluid cells, and four additional pregnancies have been screened using cultured chorionic villi. Essentially no branching enzyme activity was detectable in eight samples (amniocytes); activities within the control range were found in five samples (three amniocyte and two chorionic villi samples); and five samples appeared to have been derived from carriers. In two of the cases lacking branching enzyme activity, in which the pregnancies were terminated and fibroblasts were successfully cultured from the aborted fetuses, no branching enzyme activity was found. Another fetus, which was predicted by antenatal assay to be affected, was carried to term. Skin fibroblasts from this baby were deficient in branching enzyme. Pregnancies at risk for glycogen storage disease due to the deficiency of branching enzyme can be successfully monitored using either cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes.\r"

A control group of individuals from Southeast Asia shared the same major haplotypes, 4, 1, and 7, with Polynesians. These data provide further support for the theories of genetic homogeneity and of Asian affinities of the Polynesian precursor populations. The absence of severe phenylketonuria (PKU) in both Polynesians and Southeast Asians is consistent with the lack of PAH haplotypes 2 and 3, on which the severe PKU mutants have arisen among Caucasians.\r"

Since minisatellite regions with larger repeat elements often display extensive length polymorphisms, we suspected that (TG)n repeats (\"microsatellites\") might also be polymorphic. Using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a (TG)n microsatellite in the human cardiac actin gene, we detected 12 different allelic fragments in 37 unrelated individuals, 32 of whom were heterozygous. Codominant Mendelian inheritance of fragments was observed in three families with a total of 24 children. Because of the widespread distribution of (TG)n microsatellites, polymorphisms of this type may be generally abundant and present in regions where minisatellites are rare, making such microsatellite loci very useful for linkage studies in humans.\r"

The assay for somatic mutation measures the frequency of variant erythrocytes which are progeny of erythroid precursor cells with mutations that result in a loss of gene expression at the polymorphic glycophorin A (GPA) locus. Samples from 14 of 15 A-T homozygotes showed high frequencies of GPA gene expression-loss variant cells with normal expression of only one of the two alleles at the GPA locus (i.e., GPA hemizygous variant cells). The mean elevation of the frequency of hemizygous variant cells over those in normal controls and unaffected family members was 7-14-fold. A-T homozygotes also showed an increase in the frequency of cells in which one allele at the GPA locus had lost expression and in which the remaining allele was expressed at a homozygous level (i.e., GPA homozygous variant cells). Family members who are obligate A-T heterozygotes did not appear to have a significantly elevated frequency of GPA hemizygous or homozygous variant cells. These indications of elevated in vivo frequencies of variant erythrocytes in A-T homozygotes support a causal link between susceptibility to somatic mutation and susceptibility to cancer.\r"

Many different LDL receptor mutations have been identified and characterized, demonstrating a high degree of allelic heterogeneity at this locus. The ability to identify mutant LDL receptor genes for prenatal diagnosis of homozygous FH or to study the role of the LDL receptor gene in polygenic hypercholesterolemia requires the use of closely linked RFLPs. In the present study we used 10 different RFLPs, including three newly described polymorphisms, to construct 123 independent haplotypes from 20 Caucasian American pedigrees. Our sample contained 31 different haplotypes varying in frequency from 0.8% to 29.3%; the five most common haplotypes account for 67.5% of the sample. The heterozygosity and PIC of each site were determined, and these values disclosed that eight of the RFLPs were substantially polymorphic. Linkage-disequilibrium analysis of the haplotype data revealed strong nonrandom associations among all 10 RFLPs, especially among those sites clustered in the 3' region of the gene. Evolutionary analysis suggests the occurrence of both mutational and recombinational events in the generation of the observed haplotypes. A strategy for haplotype analysis of the LDL receptor gene in individuals of Caucasian American descent is presented.\r"

The order of this probe relative to the gene for Huntington disease (HD) and other previously described markers has not been established. Analysis of 24 affected families with HD has shown that D4S95 is in tight linkage with the gene causing HD, with a maximal Lod score of 12.489 at a theta of .03. D4S90 is a probe which maps to 4p16.3, telomeric to D4S95, and detects polymorphisms with HincII and other enzymes. In one affected person, recombination has occurred between D4S10 and HD, between D4S95 and HD, and in all likelihood also between D4S90 and HD, which strongly suggests that the gene for HD is telomeric to all these DNA probes. This suggests that the gene causing HD is located in the most distal region of the short arm of chromosome 4, flanked by D4S90 and the telomere, and supports the locus order D4S10-D4S95-D4S90-HD-telomere. D4S95 is a most useful DNA marker for predictive testing programs, while D4S90 will serve as a useful starting point for identifying DNA fragments closer to the gene for HD.\r"

Furthermore, it was determined that within the patient population, the Km1 allotype was associated with the absence of detectable serum autoantibodies.

The MZ intraclass correlation (rMZ) of .70 was significantly larger (P less than .05) than the DZ correlation (rDZ) of .45, providing evidence for genetic influences (Smith et al. 1973). Radial bone mass measurements repeated 16 years later (1986-87) on 25 of the MZ pairs and on 21 of the DZ pairs revealed an rMZ of .61 and an rDZ of .44, but the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). The twins had an average radial mass loss of 0.49%/year between the two examinations. The rMZ (.52) and rDZ (.49) values for the 16-year loss in radial mass were both significantly different from zero, but their similar size indicated that the correlations were due to nongenetic factors. In a search for the source of genetic influences on adult radial mass, heritability was estimated by the formula 2(rMZ - rDZ) for radial width and was found to be .66 and .76 (P less than .05) for examinations 1 and 2, respectively. An index of radial density (mass/width) was calculated, and the differences between rMZ and rDZ were not significant at either examination. The intraclass correlations (rMZ = .35; rDZ = .43) were both significant for the loss of bone density between examinations but provided no evidence for genetic influences, results similar to the findings for the loss of mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Total ischemic activity may be similar in any given patient, but the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic episodes will differ. Prognosis appears dependent on the degree of total ischemic activity plus the extent of coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of therapy can be monitored with exercise testing and/or Holter monitoring. Using the latter technique, the largest multicenter study to date, the Nifedipine Total Ischemia Awareness Program, has demonstrated the advantages of adding a calcium antagonist to nitrate and/or beta-blocker therapy regimens in order to maximize the reduction in total ischemic activity in angina patients.\r"

These episodes tend to occur at only minimal increases in heart rate above resting levels, well below the level of myocardial oxygen demand required to produce ischemia on formal exercise tolerance testing. In all likelihood, therefore, most ischemic events in ambulatory patients are due to a combination of flow-limiting coronary stenosis and superimposed vasoactive or thrombotic elements. Asymptomatic ischemic events are common in subsets of patients with angina pectoris. Traditionally, treatment with calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and long-acting nitrates has been aimed at reducing episodes of angina pectoris. Despite a reduction in anginal symptoms, however, it is likely that patients continue to experience silent ischemia, particularly at rest and during activities of daily living. The strategy for treatment in such patients should include the abolition of the patients' \"total ischemic activity.\" It is conceivable that more aggressive anti-ischemic therapy may improve prognosis, as patients with ambulatory ST-segment depression experience frequent cardiac events. Other potential benefits of more aggressive treatment include the prevention of myocardial hibernation, which occurs as a result of a chronic ischemic state, and a reduction in episodes of myocardial stunning. This approach may lead to protection against transient and chronic left ventricular dysfunction, which is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease.\r"

The total number of live births was 2400 and the frequency of hypertension was 8.8%. The study group comprised 2023 normotensive and 200 hypertensive deliveries. Dates of all pregnancies were established at an ultrasound examination in week 17. Ominous intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns were significantly more common in hypertensive deliveries than in normotensive deliveries (20.5% versus 7.6%). The women with hypertension were compared with a group of control women matched for age, parity, induction of labor, and gestational week (20.5% versus 6.5%). In hypertensive women ominous fetal heart rate tracings were frequently associated with primiparity, induced labor, epidural block, delivery of a growth-retarded fetus, and beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockers. Ominous fetal heart rate patterns were less common in hypertensive women without these risk factors; still the significant differences in comparison with normotensive women remained. The hypertensive pregnancies accounted for no less than 21.0% of all ominous intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns, whereas 13% of all cases of ominous intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns could be attributed to the excess frequency in hypertensive pregnancies.\r"

These deep perineal tears occurred in 0.9% of the women delivered of infants without the use of either episiotomy or stirrups and in 27.9% of the women delivered of infants with both episiotomy and stirrups. Women exposed to episiotomy alone or to stirrups alone had intermediate rates of laceration. There was no independent correlation of laceration with maternal age, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, or midwife or physician as delivery attendant. The results suggest that selective use of episiotomy and stirrups can minimize perineal trauma during spontaneous delivery in nulliparous women.\r"

A new, ultrasensitive kit has now been released with a lower level of detection of 0.5 microgram of phosphatidylglycerol per milliliter of fluid. This is the first report of this new kit, which we used with vaginal pool samples and with contaminated amniocentesis samples. We evaluated this kit for concordance with thin-layer chromatography results as well as fetal outcome. Of 48 vaginal pool samples, 41 (85%) showed concordance, whereas 39 of 42 (93%) contaminated amniocentesis samples were concordant, for an overall concordance of 89% (80 of 90 samples). Sixty-seven infants were delivered within 72 hours of the test and there were no cases of hyaline membrane disease in the presence of a positive test result. We conclude that this new, ultrasensitive kit is a good, time-saving, and reliable test for the detection of phosphatidylglycerol without the development of false-positive results even when tested on the worst possible fluid samples. A review of clinical studies involving the Amniostat-FLM is also presented.\r"

  ".U": "89132658\r", 
  ".W": "Human papillomavirus infection is implicated as an etiologic agent in the development of neoplasia and invasive carcinoma of the cervix. To detect human papillomavirus infection of the cervix, cells must be collected and assayed for human papillomavirus-related deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. Gynecologists and other clinical investigators generally use an exocervical spatula scrape and an endocervical swab for cell collection, analogous to Papanicolaou smear collection. However, inadequate cell recovery is common. To overcome this problem, we have developed the cervicovaginal lavage method for human papillomavirus detection. In the present study we compared the cervicovaginal lavage method with the widely used scrape-swab method in 48 women referred for colposcopic examination. After a Papanicolaou test, two samples were obtained from each woman, either with cervicovaginal lavage followed by scrape-swab or with the scrape-swab followed by cervicovaginal lavage. Human papillomavirus types were assessed by restriction analysis and Southern blot hybridization. In 21 women (44%) test results were positive for human papillomavirus with both the scrape-swab and cervicovaginal lavage cell collection methods; in nine women (19%) test results were positive only with the cervicovaginal lavage method; and in 18 women (38%) results were negative for human papillomavirus with both techniques. None of the women had human papillomavirus detected by scrape-swab without also having it detected with cervicovaginal lavage. The human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid types identified were concordant in the 21 women whose infections were detected with both sampling methods, although the second virus type was detected only with cervicovaginal lavage in one woman who had a mixed genital tract infection. We concluded that cervicovaginal lavage is a more sensitive cell collection method than the scrape-swab technique for assessing human papillomavirus infection of the cervix.\r"

Preoperative serum specimens collected from 86 women awaiting major gynecologic surgery were tested for the presence of antiendotoxin by a qualitative method. These patients were closely followed up in the postoperative period and any evidence of pyrexia or infection was noted. There were 21 (24%) patients who had preexisting antibodies. Of the women studied, 47 (55%) had some form of postoperative infection, of which 32 (37%) were exclusively a result of gram-negative bacteria. There was a significant association (p less than 0.05) between postoperative infection and the absence of preexisting antibodies. This association was particularly striking (p less than 0.02) when postoperative urinary tract infections were considered. There was no association between postoperative pyrexia and the absence of preexisting antibody. Our results confirm the findings of previous studies to evaluate the protective role of antiendotoxin in surgical procedures. In the future immunization may be considered an adjunct or alternative to prophylactic antibiotics.\r"

Amniotic fluids from 26 second-trimester (14 to 23 weeks) and 75 third-trimester (29 to 40 weeks) normal singleton pregnancies were evaluated for prolactin content by radioimmunoassay and bioassay with the Nb2 rat lymphoma cell line. The relative bioactivity was calculated as the ratio of bioassay to radioimmunoassay for each fluid. Data segregated by gestational age and fetal genetic sex identified a highly significant difference (p = 0.0004) in amniotic fluid prolactin radioimmunoassay concentrations (mean +/- SEM) that surround male (682 +/- 49, n = 42) versus female (440 +/- 39, n = 33) fetuses of third-trimester age. Paired bioassay values were significantly lower (p = 0.002) than radioimmunoassay values among males (626 +/- 52) but equivalent (p = 0.1066) among females (464 +/- 44). The bioassay/radioimmunoassay ratios of third-trimester fetal female-associated amniotic fluid prolactin were significantly higher (p = 0.0004) than those of third-trimester males and second-trimester males and females. The results suggest a fetal gender-related factor is associated with both the production and the biologic activity of the maternally derived hormone. Thus the fetus appears to have some control over the dynamics of uterine prolactin production.\r"

Overall it was possible to document the presence of abnormal genital findings indicating or strongly suggesting sexual abuse in only 46% of the patients in this study group. Failure to document findings suggestive of abuse in half of the girls highlights the limitations of the medical evaluation in validating sexual abuse.\r"

However, data concerning the usefulness of colposcopy in such evaluations are lacking. In a prospective study, 130 prepubertal girls (mean age 5.5 years) who were identified by child protective agencies to be victims of sexual abuse were evaluated both by an unaided examination and by colposcopy. If the colposcopic findings differed from those of the unaided inspection, the macroscopic examination was repeated to determine whether the abnormality could have been detected without magnification. Altogether, 92 of the 130 girls were found to have abnormal findings. In the majority of girls with abnormalities (96%), the abnormalities were observed during the unaided examination. Of the four patients in whom the findings were detected initially by the colposcopic examination, these findings were observed during the repeat unaided examination. The findings were observed by colposcopic examination alone in only one patient. We conclude that unaided examination is adequate for the evaluation of most victims of sexual abuse.\r"

Contrary to the above classification, early iron deficiency without anemia was infrequently identified by an increase in distribution width (4 of 25 patients). The distribution width was not consistently increased in the 49 anemic, iron-deficient patients; 34 were normal and would have been considered to have thalassemia minor or anemia of chronic disease according to the new classification. The distribution width was no more sensitive than the mean corpuscular volume in suggesting iron deficiency. This study does not confirm the usefulness of the new classification in the diagnosis of iron deficiency in this patient population.\r"

In this study occult human papillomavirus infection in postmenopausal women was examined to determine if the histologic findings with such infections were indeed nondiagnostic and to compare the rate of occult human papillomavirus infection in this group with that in a younger age group. In five of 43 cases (12%) sequences homologous to human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were detected in biopsy specimens from the cervices of hysterectomy specimens of postmenopausal women who had no history of abnormal Papanicolaou smears or genital tract neoplasms. This rate was not significantly different from that found in a premenopausal group of women (8%, n = 60) studied concurrently. Except for one case in which human papillomavirus type 11 was detected, the human papillomavirus types in the occult infections were distinct from those commonly associated with the genital tract. The histologic features of human papillomavirus infection were not found in the human papillomavirus-positive cases, except for one case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The similar rates of occult infection in the two age groups suggests that about 10% of women over a wide range of ages may be infected by human papillomavirus but have no clinical or pathologic evidence of the infection.\r"

Twenty of these 69 patients had three or more previous cesarean sections; 9 underwent trial of labor, with 8 subsequent vaginal deliveries. The vaginal delivery rate after more than one previous cesarean section was no different from that of patients with only one previous cesarean section. We conclude that trial of labor in patients with more than one previous cesarean section did not result in a deleterious outcome.

However, available glucose drinks are often associated with varying degrees of gastrointestinal symptoms that might preclude meaningful studies. Polycose (Ross Labs, Columbus, Ohio) is a glucose saccharide polymer mixture containing 3% glucose, 7% maltose, 5% maltotriose, and 85% polysaccharide of 4 to 15 glucose units, with an osmotic load one fifth that of glucose. We assessed the efficacy of this glucose polymer in the performance of a 3-hour carbohydrate tolerance test with glucose and glucose polymer used 3 to 5 days apart in each patient tested. After 2 days of 300 gm carbohydrate-enriched diets, 48 patients underwent 3-hour carbohydrate tolerance tests at a mean gestational age of 30 +/- 3 weeks. Statistical analysis revealed a moderate level of agreement (kappa = 0.45, p less than 0.001) between the results of both carbohydrate tolerance test preparations. Patients experienced fewer gastrointestinal symptoms with the glucose polymer than with glucose. These preliminary data suggest that glucose polymer may be effectively used in the performance of a 3-hour carbohydrate tolerance test.\r"

Reference ranges for these parameters were established by measurement of blood glucose (n = 122) and oxygen tension (n = 189) levels in appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses that were undergoing cordocentesis in the prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities. The fetuses were subsequently found to be unaffected by the condition investigated. In the small-for-gestational-age fetuses, the maternal-to-fetal blood glucose concentration gradients for the umbilical vein and artery correlated significantly with the degree of fetal hypoxia but not with the degree of fetal smallness. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the relationship of maternal and fetal blood glucose concentration gradient and hypoxia between the umbilical venous and arterial samples, which suggests that the major cause of hypoglycemia in small-for-gestational-age fetuses is reduced supply rather than increased fetal consumption or decreased endogenous production of glucose.\r"

A 2-year combined study, with regard to longer use of intrauterine contraceptive devices (greater than 2 years), did not show any significant reduction in fertility or increase in ectopic gestation within 24 months. However, in gravid women of similar age distribution, there was a significant increase in the miscarriage rate, compared with use of intrauterine contraceptive devices for less than 2 years or compared with nulligravid women. In a 1-year study, removals because of complications did not cause a significant reduction in fertility or an increase in ectopic gestation, miscarriage, or preterm delivery rates within 12 months, compared with removals to allow conception.\r"

Eleven women had never used oral contraceptives, and 14 women had used oral contraceptives for a minimum of 67 months. All oral contraceptive users had used preparations that provided a minimum of 50 micrograms mestranol per day. Trabecular bone density was determined by quantitative single-energy computerized tomography of the L1-3 lumbar vertebral bodies. Trabecular bone density was similar for both the control group and the oral contraceptive users, 160.6 +/- 6.9 versus 161.2 +/- 7.4 mg/ml, respectively. The power to detect a 15% difference in bone density between these two samples was 0.87. We concluded that long-term, premenopausal oral contraceptive use has no effect on vertebral bone density.\r"

This practice is based on data from terminations with saline solution as the abortifacient. Herein we report our experience with the use of prostaglandin E2 vaginal suppositories for midtrimester terminations, with particular regard to placental delivery rates and associated complications. Ninety-six patients underwent prostaglandin E2 vaginal suppository terminations. Fifty-eight percent of patients had spontaneous placental delivery within 2 hours of the passage of the fetus; approximately two thirds of these were expelled within 30 minutes. Previous work involving elective saline solution-induced terminations suggested the 2-hour time limit for the third stage of labor. This was based on an unacceptable complication rate of greater than 4% beyond 2 hours. The present study of the use of prostaglandin E2 suppositories for a variety of indications demonstrated a similar complication rate of 4% at 30 minutes. These findings suggest expectant management beyond this time limit may produce unacceptably high complication rates.\r"

After puncture of the umbilical vein, bleeding times were measured in amniotic fluid and 0.9% sodium chloride. The quantity of Wharton's jelly was assessed by measuring umbilical cord circumference. Mean bleeding times were significantly shorter in amniotic fluid compared with saline solution, but there was no consistent relationship between bleeding times and umbilical cord circumference.

Twenty-one pregnancies occurred in asymptomatic women who had both prior fetal death and a high IgG antiphospholipid antibody titer.

The concentrations of free beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and total beta-subunit were determined on the sera. The assay data were expressed as a ratio of nanograms of free beta-subunit per 1000 mIU of total beta-subunit. The ratios, analyzed by the Wilcoxon two-sample test, indicated a highly significant correlation between high ratios and the eventual diagnosis of high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease (p = 0.0019). This study suggests that the excessive production of free beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin may identify patients with high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease much earlier and identify gestational trophoblastic disease in patients during pregnancy.\r"

The preoperative resting urethral closure pressure and urethral functional length were significantly lower in the study (failure) group than in the control (success) group.

To examine clonidine's acute maternal and fetal effects were intravenously injected 300 micrograms clonidine in eight chronically prepared normotensive near term ewes. Unlike intravenous saline solution injection, clonidine produced significant toxicity--intraamniotic pressure increased 97 +/- 27% (p less than 0.05), uterine blood flow decreased 55 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001), maternal and fetal serum glucose increased 158 +/- 23% and 249 +/- 91%, respectively (p less than 0.001), and maternal and fetal Po2 decreased to 44 mm Hg +/- 4 mm Hg and 13 mm Hg +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Maternal and fetal blood pressure and serum cortisol were unaffected by clonidine, whereas heart rate decreased. No adverse maternal or fetal effects were noted with serum clonidine concentrations less than 1.0 ng/ml. Direct fetal infusion of clonidine did not lower fetal arterial Po2 levels, although heart rates decreased and serum glucose levels increased. The multiple effects of clonidine infusion are best explained by actions on alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. These results suggest that intravenous administration of clonidine may adversely affect the fetus by direct actions and by alterations in maternal physiology.\r"

The normal fall in blood pressure during pregnancy was prevented by the reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Labetalol (1 to 6 mg/kg) effectively lowered mean arterial pressure 22% by decreasing cardiac output 16%; total peripheral resistance was not significantly decreased. Thus, the blood pressure lowering effect of labetalol was due primarily to its beta-adrenergic blocking effect. Regional flows to the carcass and splanchnic circulation were decreased 19% and 15%, respectively, after labetalol administration. Uterine wall and ovarian perfusion were significantly reduced, but placental perfusion was not significantly altered. Because labetalol lowers blood pressure without reducing placental perfusion, it may be a useful alternative to hydralazine for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy.\r"

In pregnant sheep the fetal left thoracic lymph duct was catheterized at the base of the neck and this catheter was connected to a jugular-vein catheter so the lymph could spontaneously return to the fetal circulation. At 5 days after catheter implantation in nine unanesthetized fetuses at 133 +/- 1 (SE) days' gestation, lymph flow was measured by disconnecting the lymphatic catheter from that in the jugular vein and varying outflow pressure of the lymphatic catheter independent of venous pressure. Whenever outflow pressure was negative, lymph flow was independent of outflow pressure and averaged 0.66 +/- 0.05 ml/min. When outflow pressure of the left thoracic duct was increased above zero, lymph flow decreased linearly with outflow pressure and flow stopped at an outflow pressure of 11.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg. At a normal venous pressure of 3 mm Hg, the lymph-flow sensitivity to venous pressure was such that a 1 mm Hg rise in venous pressure reduced lymph flow by 12.7% +/- 1.2%. Thus it appears that fetal lymph flow is very sensitive to outflow pressure and only moderate elevations in venous pressure potentially may lead to fetal edema.\r"

The infusion rate of 0.125 micrograms/min elevated resting plasma concentrations of epinephrine in nonpregnant rats by about sevenfold (from 0.28 to 1.98 ng/ml). Under these conditions, epinephrine did not affect the number of rats maintaining pregnancy, their litter size, or the numbers of resorptions, fetal deaths, and malformations. Fetal and placental weights were unaffected except for a slight trend for fetal weight to be depressed in larger litters of rats treated during days 15 to 22. It seems that the rat embryo is resistant to elevations of epinephrine concentrations equivalent to those observed under mild to severe stress conditions.\r"

In maternal blood, 12.5% of pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy showed elevated levels of CA 125 (65 to 100 U/ml). Late in gestation, CA 125 levels in cord blood and fetal urine were always less than 65 U/ml. Immunohistochemical study of CA 125 in fetal membranes, placenta, and decidua showed the presence of antigen only in the amnion. These results suggest that CA 125 is shed into amniotic fluid directly from the amniotic membrane.\r"

It has been particularly difficult to make assessments in clinical material where the use of tracer materials may not be practical. In this study, immunohistochemical staining for albumin was performed on paraffin-embedded eyes from patients with no known ocular disease and those with various stages of diabetic retinopathy. No extravascular albumin was detected in the retina or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of normal nondiabetics or diabetics with no ocular findings, but it was detected in 12.5% of mildly affected diabetics, 20% of background diabetic retinopathy cases, and 89% of proliferative diabetic retinopathy cases. The inner retinal vasculature appeared to be the primary site of leakage in diabetics because all cases demonstrating extravascular albumin-positivity expressed it in the inner retina. It usually permeated the vessel walls and spread along the inner surface of the retina. Some of these cases also contained albumin in the outer retina and RPE, suggesting that additional leakage also may occur through the RPE. A case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis showed albumin staining predominantly in the inner retina, whereas a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment showed only outer retina staining. These data suggest immunohistochemical staining for albumin may be a useful technique for localizing blood-retinal barrier breakdown.\r"

Significantly more veins have a muscular or partially muscular wall than normal (P less than or equal to 0.001 for veins in each size category less than or equal to 150 mu, chi-square test). In some veins new muscle develops between an external and internal lamina but in many it develops within the intima, beneath the endothelium and adluminal to a single lamina. Small veins (20-25 mu in ED) with a muscular or partially muscular wall are present only in the hyperoxic lung. Increase in the percent medial thickness (%MT) of veins indicates lumen narrowing: this is relatively greater in the smallest veins. Reduction in the cross-sectional area of venous segments that are immediately postcapillary, by lumen narrowing or occlusion, contributes to the restriction of the pulmonary vascular bed by hyperoxia.\r"

The clinical signs, the deficiency of lysosomal enzymes, and the familial nature of the disorder suggested that the condition was a lysosomal storage disease. Four affected sheep were necropsied and their tissues were examined by histopathologic and histochemical methods to determine if the lesions were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease. Central nervous system neurons were enlarged with finely to coarsely granular cytoplasmic material, or less often, neurons were distended with multiple, variably-sized vacuoles. Loss of neurons without gliosis was evident and the Nissl substance was either dispersed and fragmented or condensed around the nuclei of remaining neurons. Neurons of intestinal and other peripheral ganglia, retinal ganglion cells, and heart Purkinje fibers were enlarged similarly. White matter of the cerebrum and spinal cord had numerous spheroid to ellipsoid axonal enlargements. Periportal hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells were enlarged with marked vacuolation. The neuronal storage material stained intensely with periodic acid-Schiff/alcian blue, with Luxol fast blue, for acid phosphatase, and moderately with oil red O stains. Renal and hepatocyte storage material stained intensely with oil red O and moderately with periodic acid-Schiff/alcian blue and Sudan black B stains. The lesions in these sheep were consistent with those of a lysosomal storage disease. Both neuronal and visceral storage occurred, but the neuronal storage was more severe.\r"

In all tumor biopsies most of the stromal cells were positive for NSE. About 30% of the stromal cells showed a weak cytoplasmic synaptophysin positivity. Approximately 25% of the stromal cells were labeled with antibodies against substance P and neuropeptide YY. The partly strong reactivity was localized preferentially in perinuclear regions. These positive cells were mainly distributed in small cell clusters but were also scattered in the tumor parenchyma. In all tumor biopsies scattered cells exhibited strong perinuclear enkephalin positivity, corresponding probably to mast cells, whereas stromal cells were entirely negative. For serotonin, VIP, and neurotensin no specific reaction was seen. On the basis of these findings it is proposed that hemangioblastomas have a neuroendocrine component.\r"

  ".W": "In adult rat lung the lectin Maclura pomifera agglutinin (MPA) binds apically to alveolar type II (ATII) cells but not to alveolar type I (ATI) cells. This suggests that the presence of MPA binding glycoproteins might be a criterion by which to distinguish the differentiated state of these two adult alveolar epithelial cells. The authors therefore studied MPA binding glycoproteins of ATII cells, comparing, biochemically and cytochemically, MPA binding glycoproteins in freshly isolated ATII cells with those in cultures of ATII cells that are \"dedifferentiating\" or have \"dedifferentiated\" as a result of growth on tissue culture plasticware. A MPA binding glycoprotein (185 kd) that is present in freshly isolated \"differentiated\" ATII cells and then is subsequently lost as isolated ATII cells \"dedifferentiate\" in tissue culture has been identified. This 185 kd MPA binding glycoprotein alone, or expressed in conjunction with other proteins, is a candidate for a differentiation marker for ATII cells. Preliminary data suggests that this 185 kd MPA binding glycoprotein is not found in ATI cells.\r"

Proteoglycans of the aortic intimal-medial tissues of rabbits that had undergone denudation with a balloon catheter 12 weeks earlier were isolated after homogenization of the tissues in 0.33 M sucrose, ultracentrifugation and subsequently by gel-exclusion chromatography. Lipoproteins from the plasma of healthy donors were prepared by sequential, ultracentrifugal floatation after density adjustment with KBr. To study the interactions, aliquots of electrophoretically pure very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL, d less than 1.006 g/ml), low-density lipoproteins (LDL, d = 1.019-1.063 g/ml), or high-density lipoproteins (HDL, d = 1.210 g/ml) were incubated with proteoglycans in the presence of Ca++ and Mg++ at 4 C. The amount of cholesterol found in the resulting pellet was measured as a marker of the binding capacity of the proteoglycans. Among lipoprotein fractions both VLDL and LDL showed strong binding with proteoglycans, whereas no appreciable binding was observed when incubation experiments were done with HDL. There were significant differences in the lipoprotein binding capacity of proteoglycan of control and injured animals, indicating that injury induced changes in proteoglycan composition exert profound influences on their ionic interactions.\r"

The criteria used to select MAb-defined antigens as targets for passive immunotherapy or immunolocalization of melanoma include: 1) consistent antigen expression in melanomas, 2) restricted antigen distribution in normal tissues and nonmelanocytic tumors, and 3) cytotoxic activity of the MAb or MAb conjugates. The present study examined the tissue distribution of three prototype melanoma cell surface antigens, the Mr 57,000 glycoprotein (gp57) recognized by MAb A42, the GD3 ganglioside, and the mel-CSPG chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to examine a large panel of normal tissues and over 150 malignant tumors. It was found that A42 has a highly restricted distribution in normal tissues and is expressed in subsets of melanomas and nonmelanocytic tumors. It was also found that GD3 and mel-CSPG are more widely distributed in normal tissues and among tumors than was thought previously. These immunohistochemical patterns provide an essential data base to evaluate the ongoing clinical trials employing MAbs to GD3 and mel-CSPG for the therapy and immunolocalization of melanomas, and they identify gp57 as a potential marker for subsets of normal and transformed melanocytic cells.\r"

In adults the antigen is present on venous, arterial and capillary endothelial cells of heart, kidney, liver, spleen, intestine, skin, uterus, placenta, and arteries only, as shown by immunohistochemical investigation using the PAP technique. The antigen 10F3 is also present on the mesenchymal cells of human fetal tissues (7 and 18-week-old fetuses) and on SMC of 7-week-old fetal aorta, and a subpopulation of cells reacting with 10F3 antibody also has been found in atherosclerotic intima. Double staining using 10F3 antibody and muscle actin-specific monoclonal antibody HHF-35 showed that the antigen-positive cells are smooth muscle cells. In primary culture of adult SMC, antigen-positive cells were detected 2 days after seeding (about 90% positive in medial and intimal cultures). It is suggested that 10F3 is a mesenchymal antigen that, lost during differentiation by cells other than endothelium, but expressed again by the SMC involved in atherogenesis.\r"

The main histologic findings observed by light microscopy 24-72 hours after the injection of PAF were edema, polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, cell vacuolization, and acinar cell necrosis. Fat cell necrosis was present in 30% of animals. By electron microscopy an increase of the number of zymogen granules in the apical region of acinar cells was observed 3 hours after PAF challenge. At 24-72 hours, many acinar cells showed vacuoles containing myelinlike figures, zymogen granules, and cellular debris. Pancreatic lesions developed in the area supplied by the artery injected with PAF and they were completely antagonized by the pretreatment of rabbits with CV 3988, a specific antagonist of PAF. In addition, the significant protective effect of atropine suggests a potential role for cholinergic mechanisms in the pancreatic alterations induced by PAF.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin (SS) receptors as well as EGF receptors have been shown to be present in various brain tumors such as meningiomas or glia-derived tumors. Using receptor autoradiography for both receptors, their localization on adjacent tumor sections was investigated and a correlation was attempted. In glia-derived tumors, there was an inverse relationship for the incidence of the two receptors in individual tumors: in a majority of cases (five of eight) of well-differentiated astrocytomas (I-II), SS receptors were present, but in none of the cases (zero of eight) EGF receptors were detected. In undifferentiated glioblastomas, the reverse situation was observed, no SS receptors were found (0 of 14) but EGF receptors were present in a majority of tumors (8 of 14). In astrocytomas III both types of receptors were normally seen. These data suggest that in glia-derived tumors, SS receptors are markers for the well-differentiated cases as opposed to EGF receptors. In meningiomas, SS receptors are found in all (27 of 27) tumors and EGF receptors in a large percentage (23 of 27) of the same tumors. However, in some cases a coincidence of both receptors on the same cell can be excluded. Furthermore, no effect of the SS analog SMS 201-995 on basal or EGF-stimulated growth of meningiomas in culture could be detected. Nevertheless, the coexistence of the two receptor types in meningiomas may be suggestive for a potential functional interaction between EGF and SS.\r"

The tumor cells were shown by electron microscopy to correspond to sparsely granulated somatotrophs but immunocytochemistry showed that they contained no, moderate, or little growth hormone. Two tumors examined in vitro secreted small amounts of growth hormone in the tissue culture medium initially with a spontaneous rise after several days, and responded to growth hormone-releasing hormone stimulation with increased growth hormone release. In situ hybridization demonstrated growth hormone mRNA expression in adenoma cells. Clinically silent somatotroph adenomas represent a hitherto undescribed entity; electron microscopy shows that they consist of somatotrophs, and express growth hormone mRNA but do not secrete growth hormone in amounts needed to raise substantially serum growth hormone levels and cause acromegaly. Further work is required to clarify the mechanisms accounting for the lack of clinical and biochemical evidence of hormone excess associated with these tumors.\r"

The objective was to monitor the sequence (day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8), fibrillar composition, and nature of isoproterenol-induced collagen remodeling, which was found previously to adversely influence myocardial stiffness. The following were found: 1) a distortion and widening of intermuscular spaces on day 1 that was accompanied by the disruption of collagen fibers; 2) by day 2, these spaces were closing and a new fibrillar collagen network had appeared consisting primarily of thinner collagen fibers that crossed over muscle fibers; 3) the new fibrillar network took on a clear crisscrossing pattern on day 3 and 4 as an ever-increasing number of thicker fibers became entwined perpendicular to the thinner fibers; and 4) by day 8, a dense mesh of thick and thin collagen fibers had formed to encircle muscle while a greater number of intermuscular spaces, previously devoid of collagen, were now filled with thicker and thinner collagen fibers. Thus, isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis is initiated by the appearance of interstitial edema and fibrillar collagen disruption and is followed soon thereafter by the formation of thinner collagen fibers that extend across muscle fibers and into which thicker collagen fibers become entwined in a crisscrossing pattern. Once formed, this mesh of collagen fibers encircles cardiac muscle. This pattern of fibrous tissue formation may entrap and isolate myocytes so that the mechanical behavior of muscle and the intact myocardium becomes abnormal.\r"

  ".W": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a lentivirus with genetic relatedness to the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2). It induces a fatal syndrome in rhesus monkeys that closely parallels the clinical course of AIDS in humans. The authors used double-labeling immunohistochemical procedures on rhesus lymph node and spleen taken during different time periods after SIV infection to localize the p27 gag protein to specific cellular immunophenotypes. In animals with follicular hyperplasia, viral protein was found associated predominantly with follicular dendritic cells. Many of these cells showed ultrastructural alterations consisting of swollen dendritic processes containing electron-dense material. Lentiviral particles were found associated with this cell type only rarely. In lymphoid tissues with other histopathologic changes, macrophages and multinucleate giant cells were the predominant cell types containing detectable quantities of viral protein; smaller numbers of p27+ lymphocytes were present. Ultrastructurally, viral particles were found within the extracellular space adjacent to tissue macrophages and within membrane-bound vacuoles of giant cells and tissue macrophages. These results show that certain histologic patterns seen during the course of infection correlate with the localization of viral antigen to specific cellular immunophenotypes and that during the disease course, viral protein is preferentially localized in sections of lymph node and spleen to cells of the macrophage and dendritic cell lineages.\r"

  ".W": "Lymph nodes and spleens were collected at autopsy and by biopsy from 29 rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Lymph nodes were classified morphologically into stages of follicular hyperplasia, follicular involution, follicular depletion with normal or expanded paracortices, follicular and paracortical depletion, granulomatous lymphadenitis, or normal. The distribution of SIV RNA was determined by in situ hybridization using a nick translated, 35S labeled, SIVmac DNA probe. Numbers of SIV-infected cells were rare during follicular hyperplasia, numerous during follicular and paracortical expansion, and rare during follicular and paracortical depletion. The splenic morphology reflected that of the lymph nodes; however, the numbers of SIV-positive cells were uniformly lower. SIV RNA was frequently restricted to a single nucleus within multinucleate syncytial cells in two cases of granulomatous lymphadenitis. These results, combined with those of a previous study, provide evidence for antigen trapping in SIV-infected hyperplastic lymph nodes and for widespread viral infection of macrophages and lymphocytes during paracortical expansion.\r"

  ".W": "Mesangial cell hyperplasia is a feature common to several human glomerular diseases. The cause of this increased cell number is unknown. The authors assessed human mesangial cells in vitro and found that they possessed an insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor consisting of alpha and beta units (Mr, 130 k and 90 k respectively). Fifty percent inhibition of IGF-1 specific binding to the receptor required 1 X 10(-9) M IGF-1, greater than 1 X 10(-6) M insulin and 1 X 10(-7) M multiplication stimulating activity (MSA). Analysis of binding by the method of Scatchard revealed one type of IGF-1 receptor with a Kd of 1.35 X 10(-9) M, and a number per cell of 1.04 X 10(5). Binding studies on whole glomeruli had similar specificity and there were 7.17 X 10(7) receptors per glomerulus (Kd, 1.12 X 10(-9) M). Examination of the effect of IGF-1 on the cell cycle revealed that exposure of cells to both IGF-1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) led to a significant increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation into cell layers. Antibody to PDGF abolished only that response due to PDGF. Similarly, the labeling index of cells pretreated with PDGF, washed, and then exposed to IGF-1 was increased, whereas if the order of ligand exposure was reversed, there was no such additive effect. Finally, PDGF increased RNA and protein synthesis, and this response was not enhanced by IGF-1. In summary, human mesangial cells and whole glomeruli possess IGF-1-specific receptors and IGF-1 was found to act as a progression factor in the cell cycle.\r"

  ".U": "89132754\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a polypeptide hormone produced by activated macrophages detectable in the circulation of experimental animals given endotoxin. Recent evidence strongly suggests that many of the deleterious effects of endotoxin in experimental animals are mediated by TNF. Because endotoxemia in experimental animals and humans is associated with glomerular damage the present investigation was designed to establish whether TNF directly induces glomerular functional and structural changes. Twenty-three rabbits were given human recombinant TNF at the doses of 0.08, 0.8, and 8.0 micrograms/kg/h as a continuous 5-hour intravenous infusion. Animals were killed at the end of the infusion. All rabbits given 0.8 and 8.0 micrograms/kg/h TNF developed anemia (Ht value decrease at 5 hours: 0.8 microgram/kg/h, 15%; 8.0 micrograms/kg/h, 16%); leukopenia (leukocyte count decrease at 5 hours: 0.8 micrograms/kg/h, 47%; 8.0 micrograms/kg/h, 59%); thrombocytopenia (platelet count decrease at 5 hours; 0.8 micrograms/kg/h, 45%; 8.0 micrograms/kg/h, 57%). Rabbits given 8.0 micrograms/kg/h also had renal failure (serum creatinine from 1.02 +/- 0.15 to 1.64 +/- 0.34 mg/dl). By light microscopy only occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the glomerular capillaries were detectable in rabbits infused with 0.08 micrograms/kg/h TNF, whereas with 0.8 micrograms/kg/h TNF the presence of inflammatory cells in the glomerular capillaries was the prominent finding. With 8.0 micrograms/kg/h TNF beside leukocyte accumulation, fibrin was detected in the glomerular capillary lumens of two of eight animals. Electron microscopy found dose-dependent glomerular endothelial cell damage in animals given TNF with fibrinlike material in the capillary lumens. Glomerular changes induced by TNF were remarkably similar to those previously found in animals given endotoxin. Thus, TNF is likely to be the mediator of endotoxin-induced glomerular damage and can be regarded as a new mediator of macrophage-dependent damage in glomerulonephritis.\r"

The clinical and necropsy findings in two infants with NH, the results of evaluations for iron-storage disease in their first-degree relatives, and the results of the authors' studies of ferritin and transferrin-receptor (TfR) synthesis in NH and normal fibroblasts are presented. No differences between cultured skin fibroblasts from a normal infant and similar cells from the two infants with NH were seen with respect to TfR and ferritin synthesis rates or their modulation by iron. NH and adult idiopathic hemochromatosis (AH) share a pattern of siderosis in which epithelial and mesenchymal elements contain large quantities of stainable iron, while reticuloendothelial elements contain almost none. Although no familial correlation between NH and AH has been established, and none appeared to exist in these two families, the authors' results parallel those of previous studies of various cell types from persons with AH. The abnormalities in cellular iron handling, undefined at present, that are associated with the phenotype common to NH and AH do not appear primarily to involve the regulation by iron of rates of TfR and ferritin synthesis.\r"

The distribution of desmosomal complexes and their affiliated tonofilaments, as well as the regulation of cytokeratin/vimentin IF and actin microfilament contents were assessed during construction of this in vitro \"epithelium.\" 72/22 cells formed desmosomal junctions throughout the length of the cellular perimeter. Compared with low population density cultures, fully confluent sheets of 72/22 cells exhibited a down-regulated cytoskeletal actin content and increased level of cytokeratin synthesis. Despite gross IF cytoarchitectural abnormalities, 72/22 cells normally modulated the content of specific structural elements within both the IF and microfilament networks in response to increasing cell-cell contact. Furthermore, these data support the concept that neither the structural integrity nor the topographic distribution of the desmosome array are dependent on tonofilament anchorage or IF scaffold organization.\r"

  ".U": "89132760\r", 
  ".W": "Opioid peptides have a variety of actions on inter alia pituitary hormone secretion and the immune system. Release of endogenous opioids has been found to stimulate growth of experimental breast cancers and opiate receptor blockers have reduced the growth of chemically induced rat breast tumors. Opioid peptides may therefore play a role in human breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinomas from 61 premenopausal women were immunocytochemically analyzed for the presence of opioid peptide immunoreactivity. Positive staining was unambiguously identified in 34 of the tumors (56%). In addition, a medullary carcinoma was positive. In a smaller series of tumors, opioid peptide immunoreactive cells were detected in both primary tumors and metastases. Positive tumor cells were usually few and scattered. Therefore, underestimates of their true frequency of occurrence are likely to have occurred, making accurate correlations with clinical behavior and estrogen receptor status difficult. No correlations with estrogen receptors were established for the unambiguously opioid peptide-positive tumors. Many of the positive tumors also stained with antibodies to gamma-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, suggesting the presence of proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides in them. However, peptides derived from other opioid precursors also may be present in breast cancer.\r"

The mortality rate for the entire population approaches expected mortality approximately six months post-fracture, but varies by age and sex. The most important factors predicting mortality are presence of serious concomitant illness and marked delirium (in the absence of dementia) at the time of hospital admission. The authors suggest that medical factors that may contribute to patient disorientation be investigated and treated, when possible, in an effort to improve the survival status of hip fracture patients.\r"

Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.\r"

Drink calculators (cardboard wheels and wallet cards) were disseminated to customers of bars and licensed beverage outlets; bartenders and counter clerks were trained to demonstrate use of the calculators and demonstrations were presented in television spots. Program components were evaluated in three matched Vermont communities, one receiving the full community education program, one receiving the TV spots only, and one serving as control. After six months of intervention, a roadside survey of nighttime drivers (N = 892) indicated 5.3 per cent fewer drivers with BACs above 0.05 g/dl in the community program group and 1.0 per cent fewer in the TV-only group compared to the control group; however, substantially fewer drivers were found above .00 BAC in either program community than in the control. Drivers reporting heavy drinking and youthful drivers both indicated higher utilization of the materials than did other drivers. Although limited in scale and duration, this study suggests that a community education program can be effective in preventing alcohol-impaired driving.\r"

We found that high BAC levels were most frequent among brain-injured subjects between the ages of 25 and 44 and among those subjects involved in motor vehicle crashes and assaults. Contrary to expectations, injury severity and hospital mortality were inversely related to BAC level, controlling for other predictors. We believe that these inverse associations might be due to differential rates of BAC testing by severity. Among brain-injured survivors with more severe injuries, however, we found that BAC level was positively associated with the prevalence of physician-diagnosed neurological impairment at discharge and with the length of hospitalization.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three causes of injury mortality in children ages 0-14 in the United States were analyzed by age, race, sex, and state of residence for the years 1980-85. Motor vehicles caused 37 per cent of all injury-related deaths and were the leading cause of injury mortality in every group except children younger than one year, for whom homicide was the leading cause. Male death rates were at least four times female rates for suicide, unintentional firearm injury, and injuries related to farm machinery or motorcycles. The drowning rate among Whites was almost twice that of Blacks for ages 1-4, but in the 10-14 year age group the drowning rate for Blacks was over three times that of Whites. In general, the highest injury death rates were in the mountain states and the south. Between 1980 and 1985, the suicide rate in the 10-14 year age group more than doubled.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reports the results of a study of injuries conducted during a one-year period within a defined geographic population of 2.7 million persons (Aquitaine, France). Cases were defined as unintentional or intentional injuries, either resulting in immediate death before reaching hospital or requiring hospital admission. During the one-year period, 1,181 deaths were registered and 8,190 hospital admissions occurred during the sample periods. The three leading causes of injury were falls (40 per cent), traffic accidents (27 per cent), and poisonings (15 per cent). The overall incidence of injuries was 136 per 10,000 person years. Incidence by sex and age was assessed for the main external causes. The ratios of nonfatal to fatal cases were calculated by sex and age and by external cause. The origin of the injury was suicide in 14 per cent of cases and assault or homicide in 3 per cent. The severity of injuries, assessed using an automatic computation of the Injury Severity Score (ISS), ranged from 1 to 66 with a mean of 6.9. Substantial variations of ISS were observed according to external cause. At the 8th day following admission, 31 per cent of hospital-treated patients were still hospitalized and 0.8 per cent had died in hospital. The outcome correlated well with the ISS.\r"
