  ".W": "Time trends in mortality from cervical cancer in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden since the early 1950s were investigated in relation to the extent and intensity of organised screening programmes in these countries. In all five countries the cumulative mortality rates (0-74 years) fell between 1965 and 1982. In Iceland, where the nationwide programme has the widest target age range, the fall in mortality was greatest (80%). Finland and Sweden have nationwide programmes also; the mortality fell by 50% and 34%, respectively. In Denmark, where about 40% of the population are covered by organised programmes, the overall mortality fell by 25%, but in Norway, with only 5% of the population covered by organised screening, the mortality fell by only 10%. The results support the conclusion that organised screening programmes have had a major impact on the reduction in mortality from cervical cancer in the Nordic countries.\r"

Gelatin capsules were taken at doses ranging from 0.5 g to 3.0 g. Urinary iron excretion increased substantially in all three patients and in the one tested was equal to that achieved with comparable doses of subcutaneous desferrioxamine. The amounts of iron excreted were related to the dose of L1 administered and the iron load of the patients. The urinary excretion of zinc, magnesium, and calcium did not increase, and the drug was well tolerated.\r"

The ideal system of classification would identify just two categories--the cured and those who will die of their disease. Specimens from 379 patients who had undergone radical surgery for rectal cancer more than 20 years ago were re-examined in order to identify discrete pathological variables that independently influence long-term survival. The selected variables were given weighted scores and the score range was divided to provide four prognostic groups. The model was tested on a second data set comprising 331 patients and gave similar results. The new prognostic classification is simple to use and is superior to staging by the method of Dukes because it places twice as many patients into groups that provide a confident prediction of clinical outcome.\r"

A significantly increased OG was found in patients with failure of one or more organs, but rarely seen in those without organ failure. OG in non-survivors was significantly increased and sustained at a high level. Thus, the change in OG correlated with the severity of the patients' condition and their outcome. There was also a significant correlation between OG and hepatic cell function tests (arterial ketone body ratio and hepaplastin test). Analysis of non-aminoacid OG revealed that about 75% of the increased OG could be attributed to increased aminoacid concentrations, but that the remainder should be attributed to other undetermined solutes. Serial determination of OG provides information on metabolic abnormalities and prognosis of patients with progressively developing organ failure.\r"

Labelled granulocytes appeared in the respiratory tract of 16 patients within 24 h of their injection. Uptake occurred almost exclusively in areas demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) to be bronchiectatic. However, 111In uptake was not demonstrated in 21 of the 55 segments showing bronchiectasis on CT, and these were therefore thought to be not actively inflamed. The whole-body loss of radioactivity up to 4-7 days following injection of the labelled cells ranged from 0 to 53% and correlated with 24 h purulent sputum volume (r = 0.45, p less than 0.01) and with CT extent of moderate and severe bronchiectasis (r = 0.40, p less than 0.05), but not with overall CT extent of bronchiectasis, age, forced expiratory volume in one second, or duration of purulent sputum production in years.\r"

Serum prolactin levels were normal but assessment of thyroid function showed a serum thyroxine level of 25 nmol/l (normal range 76-160 nmol/l) and a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 60 mU/l (normal range 0.5-5.0 mU/l). After 8 weeks of thyroxine replacement therapy (0.05 mg daily increasing to 0.1 mg daily after 3 weeks) the visual defects had resolved, serum TSH had fallen to 0.7 mU/l, and the CT scan showed pronounced reduction in the size of the pituitary gland. Measurement of TSH as well as prolactin is essential in all patients with pituitary enlargement, to avoid unnecessary pituitary surgery.\r"

Several factors suggest a causal link: highly toxic chemicals have been used unsafely; mortality has increased only in the age and sex class occupationally exposed; mortality has decreased among unexposed urban men; specific mortality rates have increased for those conditions likely to be confused with insecticide poisoning and have decreased for others; and, both within and between years, the pattern of mortality among men has reflected that of insecticide use. The results suggest that the currently accepted figure of 10,000 deaths annually worldwide due to accidental intoxication with insecticides is a substantial underestimate.\r"

The assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% when carried out in combination with a specific inhibition stage and indirect immunofluorescence staining of alcohol-fixed normal neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating autoantibodies to human fetal pituitary cells were detected in 13 out of 51 patients who underwent transsphenoidal microsurgery for Cushing's disease. The absence of Fc receptors on human fetal pituitary corticotropin-producing cells allowed the detection of antibodies to these cells. In all the 13 patients, the antibodies were present before surgery, and 10 of them showed clinical and/or biochemical signs of incomplete cure of Cushing's disease after surgery. Only 3 out of 27 patients with a favourable outcome were antibody-positive. In all the antibody-positive patients, the antibodies were directed to corticotropin-producing cells and in 8 patients also to luteinising hormone or human growth hormone producing cells. A non-antigen-specific adherence of antibodies to Fc-receptors on corticotropin-cells was excluded by unchanged binding after preincubation of sections with purified rabbit Fc or Fc aggregates. The presence of pituitary corticotropin-cell antibodies in patients with Cushing's disease is associated with an unsuccessful outcome after transsphenoidal selective adenectomy.\r"

  ".W": "In 135 primary breast cancers, there was a significant inverse relation between epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR) and oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and a significant association with tumour size and poor differentiation. The relapse-free survival and overall survival were significantly worse for patients with EGFR+ tumours compared with EGFR- tumours. Relapse-free survival and overall survival were also worse for patients with ER- tumours compared with ER+ tumours. Of the 71 ER- patients 28 were EGFR+ and 43 were EGFR-. The relapse-free and overall survival for ER- but EGFR+ patients were significantly worse than for \"double-negative\" patients. Moreover, relapse-free survival and overall survival for \"double-negative\" patients were similar to those for ER+ patients. Thus EGFR status divides the ER- population into good and poor prognosis subgroups. The presence of EGFR was the most important variable in the primary tumours for predicting relapse-free and overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed that EGFR status was the most important variable in predicting relapse-free and overall survival in lymph-node-negative patients, and the second most important variable in lymph-node positive patients.\r"

Tissue samples were obtained from 98 patients, including one set of twins. All 99 tissue samples proved adequate for laboratory diagnosis. Chromosome mosaicism was encountered in 4 cases (among direct preparation karyotypes in 1 case, between direct and cultured cells in 2 cases, and between chorion cells [both direct and cultured] and the fetus in 1 case). No patient miscarried but 1 had a stillbirth and 1, who had undergone transcervical biopsy before referral to our hospital, started to bleed before termination of pregnancy because of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. These data suggest that the transabdominal method of chorion biopsy will fulfil its theoretical and early promise.\r"

Malnutrition is often associated with gastrointestinal infections, which lead to further deficiency of these electrolytes. Potassium and magnesium are required for protein synthesis, growth, and tissue repair. Since protein supplies are often marginal, relief food should contain sufficient potassium and magnesium to allow optimum utilisation of dietary nitrogen sources. This may be achieved by using coarse qualities of cereals, by supplementing cereals with legumes, and by avoiding cooking procedures that extract these salts from the cereals.\r"

In ten anesthetized dogs, the posterior-lateral tracheal wall and the anterior-lateral esophageal wall were stimulated by a 1 to 2 mA current with a probe placed just distal to the edge of the cricoid cartilage. The tracheal mucosa was approached through a tracheostomy stoma and the esophageal mucosa through the mouth. The resultant vocal cord motion was frequency dependent, with graded abduction occurring below 30 Hz and adduction above 40 Hz. By stimulating the posterior laryngeal mucosa proximal to the cricoid edge, the RLN branch to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle was activated, causing ipsilateral vocal cord abduction independent of frequency. Monitoring of cardiopulmonary parameters demonstrated no alterations at these amperages. There were no mucosal abrasions noted. The transtracheal and transesophageal approaches to RLN stimulation appear promising as diagnostic techniques for evaluating vocal cord function during laryngoscopy and, possibly, as methods of glottic airway control.\r"

We describe a new system of autoinflation based on a modified Valsalva technique consisting of an anesthesia mask and a flowmeter which can be used successfully by children. An objective method to record eustachian tube opening during autoinflation using frequency spectrum analysis of the ear canal sounds is also presented. Tubal opening results of this method were compared to the traditional method using preinflation and postinflation tympanometry. Study subjects included 20 adults with normal otologic findings and 35 children with middle-ear effusion; all together 107 ears of children and adults with and without effusion were tested. Using the frequency spectrum analysis, tubal opening was recorded in 75% of adult ears and 56% of children's ears. Also, in both groups, a sound pressure peak with the same characteristic frequency around 2 kHz was associated with tubal openings. The methods described are incorporated into a clinical trial being conducted at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\r"

Fifty-five consecutive patients evaluated for allergy with MRT Classes 0 or 1 were studied. Intradermal testing with 1:500 wt/vol concentrations of allergenic extracts and a 2% glycerin control were performed. Thirty-eight patients (69%) were found to have ID whealing to allergenic extracts greater than the negative glycerin controls. We conclude that ID allergen testing of patients with MRT Class 0 or 1, when using a glycerin control, identifies additional allergens to be considered for immunotherapy.\r"

Histopathologic evaluation of the papillomas showed no correlation with age of onset or clinical pattern of remission and recurrence. The pathology was characterized by abnormal squamous maturation with parakeratosis, retardation of superficial cell maturation, papillomatosis, and basal hyperplasia. HPV DNA was present in all lesions, with 92% containing either HPV-6 or 11. Latent HPV DNA was detected in clinically uninvolved tissues of 11 of 14 (78.5%) patients studied. There was no correlation between HPV type, histopathology and/or clinical pattern. Despite homogeneity of pathology, the clinical expression of laryngeal HPV infection varied widely. A mechanism for the pathogenesis of laryngeal papillomatosis, based on the concept of maturational arrest, is proposed.\r"

  ".U": "87227859\r", 
  ".W": "Early epidermoid carcinoma of the vocal cord is treated successfully by radiation therapy with high 5-year survival rates, low morbidity, and preservation of excellent voice quality in most cases. Typically, surgery is reserved for salvage of radiation failure and provides overall 5-year survival rates of 98% and 90% for T1 and T2 lesions, respectively. The extremely obese patient, often with a short neck and excessive amounts of subcutaneous fat, is difficult for both radiotherapist and surgeon to diagnose and treat. The recent observation of an unusually high rate of radiotherapy failure in a cluster of obese patients with early vocal cord cancer called attention to this problem. Because the larynx is near the thoracic inlet in obese patients, they are not suitable for administration of radiotherapy by accurate opposed lateral portals. The patients reported herein were treated entirely with anterior oblique portals. Of the five obese patients who underwent primary radiation therapy for early vocal cord cancer, three developed recurrent disease (60%) and a fourth developed a severe perichondritis requiring tracheostomy. Two patients with recurrent disease were successfully salvaged with total laryngectomy, while the third patient refused surgery and died 2 years later. The sixth patient was treated by partial laryngectomy with imbrication reconstruction and is alive and without evidence of disease 2 years following surgery. Recurrence rates and complication rates following primary radiation therapy for early vocal cord cancer appear to be unacceptably high in obese patients treated with anterior oblique portals. Therefore, we recommend conservation laryngeal surgery for obese patients with early vocal cord cancer who cannot undergo \"standard\" radiotherapeutic techniques.\r"

The tumor is an extension of an unsuspected intracranial mass, occasionally with associated multiple meningiomas or other neurogenic tumors. Ectopic meningiomas should be considered in patients with parotid and parapharyngeal masses, particularly those with cranial nerve deficits; jugular foramen syndrome is most characteristic. Associated occult intracranial and temporal bone tumors and the cranial form of neurofibromatosis should be suspected. Treatment of cervical meningiomas is excision.

Satisfactory postoperative facial function depends upon an anatomically and physiologically intact facial nerve. Precise localization of the facial nerve is the first step toward preservation of function. Intraoperative facial nerve (FN) stimulation allows the surgeon to safely locate the facial nerve. Monitoring evoked electromyographic activity with an audio speaker provides direct, ongoing information regarding trauma to the nerve during dissection. Intraoperative FN monitoring was used in 18 consecutive translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals. Seventeen patients had an excellent facial nerve result (Grade I or II using the House 6-point scale). The authors conclude that intraoperative FN stimulation and monitoring during acoustic tumor removal is a safe and reliable method of locating and protecting the facial nerve during cerebellopontine angle surgery.\r"

In this study, we report the effect of the H/N ca LMWFs on the delayed type hypersensitivity responsiveness in mice: the factors significantly inhibited the 24 hour DNFB skin reaction. These effects of the H/N ca LMWFs were again neutralizable by antibodies to P15E. Additional experiments showed that the H/N ca LMWFs had equal suppressive effects on toxic skin reactions to croton oil, and this indicates that the P15E-like H/N ca LMWFs exert their effect by aspecific mechanisms.\r"

Anterior table fractures, even when displaced, do not produce such injuries unless associated with a fracture of the supraorbital rim or nasoethmoidal complex. Combined fractures of the anterior and posterior tables are almost always accompanied by injuries to the orifices. Severity of these injuries is variable but can be predicted from the sinus wall fracture patterns. Although CT scanning is incapable of directly imaging involvement of the ostia or ducts, it will give sufficient information to allow for accurate prediction of disruption of the drainage system.\r"

The phototubometric record was superimposed on a TV screen to compare the opening in the pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube to the tube opening during swallowing. The phototubometric records of 21 normal subjects examined by phototubometry showed the close relationship with the opened tubal lumen at the tensor veli palatini muscle (TVP) attached portion. This method is useful for examining tubal patency and observing changes in the pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube.\r"

Multiple discriminant analyses performed on the ratings made by each judge revealed significant differences in ratings for various speaking parameters in the four subject groups. Results generally support the stance that tracheoesophageal speech is perceived as superior to communication with either an electrolarynx or with traditional esophageal speech, even though it is not viewed as comparable to normal voice.\r"

This study evaluated 85 patients with tympanostomy tubes divided into three groups: swimming without earplugs, swimming with earplugs, and no swimming. The infection rates were 16%, 30%, and 30% in the three groups, respectively. We conclude that swimming without earplugs does not result in an increased incidence of middle ear infections.\r"

Large negative pharyngeal pressures could cause obstructive apnea. To test this hypothesis, nasal resistance studies were performed on 37 normal subjects and 53 patients with proven obstructive sleep apnea. The results suggest that although the patients had a significantly elevated nasal resistance, the increased nasal resistance did not correlate with parameters that predict the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Although the nose probably contributes to sleep apnea, we conclude that nasal resistance is not a major factor in severe obstructive apnea.\r"

Studies of the contractility of mto muscles in vitro revealed reduced peak isometric tetanic tension and greatly prolonged relaxation times. Tubocurarine did not affect tension parameters, but did antagonize the delayed relaxation in vitro. On the basis of EMG studies alone this mutant can accurately be described as myotonic. Reduction of the contractile abnormalities by tubocurarine in vitro, however, poses further questions regarding the nature of the disorder. Although the more familiar dystrophic mouse (dy/dy) has been termed \"myotonic\" by some, the new mto mutant differs from it in all aspects examined.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the electromyographic (EMG) studies of 17 patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). In 13 of 17 patients, conventional concentric needle EMG demonstrated a \"myopathic\" pattern, usually predominating in the shoulder muscles. Single-fiber EMG showed increased jitter and/or blocking in at least one muscle in 13 of 16 patients. Jitter was increased in the frontalis muscle in 10 of 13 patients and in an arm muscle in 5 of 12. When both muscles were tested, jitter was greater in the frontalis muscle in 5 patients and in the arm muscle in 2. These observations demonstrate that it may be difficult to distinguish myasthenia gravis from CPEO by EMG. The frequency with which abnormal jitter is found in CPEO suggests that, in addition to a mild generalized myopathy, a primary defect in neuromuscular transmission may be present.\r"

The study indicates that in animals not stimulated but anesthetized for 40 min, there is no significant difference in the profile area between the normal, the heterozygous dystrophic, and dystrophic mice. There is also no significant difference between these three groups in the number of clear vesicles and of coated vesicles per micron2 of terminal. Following stimulation, the profile area of NMJs is not significantly increased in the normal and in the heterozygous dystrophic mice. However, the profile area is increased by 50% in the dystrophic animals. This is perhaps due to changes in the shape of the nerve terminal in stimulated dystrophic animals. However, the number of the clear vesicles per micron2 is significantly reduced to a similar extent in the three groups. These results indicate that the recycling of vesicular membrane is normal in dystrophic animals.\r"

Sham-operated and normal soleus muscles served as controls. Every muscle fiber within the entire muscle was individually examined and counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope following a 10-12 hour nitric acid digestion of the connective tissue. The results show that the total number of muscle fibers in the hypertrophic soleus did not differ significantly from the control. The frequency of bifurcated fibers observed in the control muscles was significantly greater than has been previously reported, and their frequency in the hypertrophic muscles, although slightly increased, was not significantly different from control values. These data confirm that fiber hypertrophy is not accompanied by hyperplasia, and they further suggest that bifurcated fibers probably play an insignificant role during muscle adaptation to hypertrophy due to their very low frequency.\r"

Recovery of latency to normal in response to the second stimulus was used to define RRP. A true RRP was calculated by subtracting ARP from measured RRP. Mean ARP for all subjects ranged from 0.75 to 0.80 msec; normal = 0.8 +/- 0.2 msec. The true RRP of control subjects was 2.1 +/- 0.5 msec, and for all alcoholic subjects it was 3.1 +/- 0.5 msec. True RRP for the nine symptomatic alcoholic subjects was 3.6 +/- 0.5 msec and 2.9 +/- 0.4 msec for those who were asymptomatic. Symptomatic and asymptomatic alcoholics differed significantly from one another, as well as from control subjects (P less than 0.001). Routine nerve conduction studies were normal in asymptomatic subjects. Three out of nine symptomatic alcoholics had increases in distal median motor or sensory latency, and three had slight slowing of median nerve conduction velocity. True RRP is more sensitive than routine measures of nerve conduction in the detection of axonal disorders influencing nerve conduction.\r"

Because siblings were affected, the disorder can be regarded as a form of muscular dystrophy. The distribution of weakness, serum enzyme changes, and histologic changes resembled an autosomal recessive distal myopathy first described by Miyoshi and differed from many other reported cases of distal myopathy. Our cases also indicate that myopathy may be asymptomatic.\r"

In the dystrophic chicken PM, however, myofibers containing slow-type C-protein reappeared about 1 month posthatch and increased in number with the progression of muscular dystrophy. We conclude that C-protein isoform expression in dystrophic myofibers resembles that in neonatal myofibers and that the expression of slow-type C-protein can be seen as a marker for chicken muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "To study the mechanism of periodic paralysis, we investigated the properties of intact muscle fibers biopsied from a patient who had adynamia episodica hereditaria with electromyographic signs of myotonia. When the potassium concentration in the extracellular medium, [K]e, was 3.5 mmol/l, force of contraction, membrane resting potential, and intracellular sodium activity were normal, but depolarizing voltage clamp steps revealed the existence of an abnormal inward current. This current was activated at membrane potentials less negative than -80 mV, reached a maximum within 50 msec, and was not inactivated with time. The inward current was completely and reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicates that it was carried by sodium ions. In a solution containing 9 mmol/l potassium, normal muscle would depolarize to -63 mV and yet be capable of developing full tetanic force upon stimulation. The muscle from the patient depolarized to -57 mV and became inexcitable, i.e., it was paralyzed. A contracture did not develop. Lowering of the extracellular pH did not influence the resting potential, but it effectively antagonized or prevented the paralytic effect of high [K]e by changing the inactivation characteristics of the sodium channels. Hydrochlorothiazide, which had a therapeutic effect on the patient, did not prevent paralysis in vitro. An abnormal rise of the intracellular sodium activity was recorded when the extracellular potassium concentration was raised to 10 mmol/l.\r"

The frequency of cancer in this syndrome has not been studied extensively. Therefore, we investigated 31 patients with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome who were followed from 1973 to 1985. All cases of cancer were verified by histopathological review. Cancer developed in 15 of the 31 patients (48 percent)--gastrointestinal carcinomas in 4, nongastrointestinal carcinomas in 10, and multiple myeloma in 1. In addition, adenomatous polyps of the stomach and colon occurred in three other patients. The cancers were diagnosed when the patients were relatively young, but after the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome had been diagnosed (interval between diagnoses, 25 +/- 20 years; range, 1 to 64). According to relative-risk analysis, the observed development of cancer in the patients with the syndrome was 18 times greater than expected in the general population (P less than 0.0001).

  ".W": "We have previously reported that the frequencies of myocardial infarction and of sudden cardiac death are highest during the period from 6 a.m. to noon. Since platelet aggregation may have a role in triggering these disorders, we measured platelet activity at 3-hour intervals for 24 hours in 15 healthy men. In vitro platelet responsiveness to either adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine was lower at 6 a.m. (before the subjects arose) than at 9 a.m. (60 minutes after they arose). The lowest concentration of these agents required to produce biphasic platelet aggregation decreased (i.e., aggregability increased) from a mean +/- SEM of 4.7 +/- 0.6 to 3.7 +/- 0.6 microM (P less than 0.01) for ADP and from 3.7 +/- 0.8 to 1.8 +/- 0.5 microM (P less than 0.01) for epinephrine. The period from 6 to 9 a.m. was the only interval in the 24-hour period during which platelet aggregability increased significantly. We subsequently studied 10 subjects on alternate mornings after they arose at the normal time and after delayed arising. The morning increase in platelet aggregability was not observed when the subjects remained supine and inactive. Thus, there is a temporal association between increased platelet aggregability in the morning and an increased frequency of myocardial infarction and of sudden cardiac death. Demonstration of this association does not establish a cause--effect relation, but together with other evidence linking platelets to these disorders, it may provide insight into the mechanisms precipitating myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death and aid in the design of more effective preventive measures.\r"

Two tissue samples from the gastric antrum were obtained from 67 of the 71 children (mean age [+/- SD], 11.4 +/- 3.8 years). One sample was evaluated for evidence of gastritis and stained with silver to detect organisms morphologically resembling campylobacter. The second sample was cultured for C. pylori, and a portion was used to perform a urease-screening test for the presence of C. pylori. Antral gastritis was diagnosed histologically in 18 of 67 patients. C. pylori was identified by both culture and silver staining on the antral mucosa in 7 of 10 patients with unexplained gastritis (primary gastritis) but in none of 8 patients with gastritis associated with an identifiable underlying cause (secondary gastritis). C. pylori was not identified in any of the 49 cases with normal histologic features. The urease-screening test was positive in only three of six patients with a positive culture for C. pylori. Duodenal ulcers were diagnosed by endoscopy in five patients. Each of the five had C. pylori on the antral mucosa, but organisms were not identified on the duodenal mucosa. We conclude that the presence of C. pylori on the antral mucosa is specifically associated with primary antral gastritis and may also be associated with primary duodenal ulceration.\r"

In this report we describe a characteristic syndrome of myopathy and neuropathy and present 12 new cases of the condition. Colchicine myopathy may occur in patients with gout who take customary doses of the drug but who have elevated plasma drug levels because of altered renal function. It usually presents with proximal weakness and always presents with elevation of serum creatine kinase; both features remit within three to four weeks after the drug is discontinued. The accompanying axonal polyneuropathy is mild and resolves slowly. Electromyography of proximal muscles shows a myopathy that is marked by abnormal spontaneous activity. Because of these features, colchicine myoneuropathy is usually misdiagnosed initially, either as probable polymyositis or as uremic neuropathy. The myopathy is vacuolar, marked by accumulation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles unrelated to necrosis or to the mild denervation in distal muscles. The morphologic changes in muscle suggest that the pathogenesis involves disruption of a microtubule-dependent cytoskeletal network that interacts with lysosomes. Correct diagnosis may save patients with this disorder from inappropriate therapy.\r"

Two of the four patients had neurosyphilis despite previous adequate therapy for early syphilis with benzathine penicillin. Meningovascular syphilis developed in one patient within four months after a primary infection, in a manner consistent with an accelerated course of syphilitic infection. These findings suggest the possibility that HIV infection may alter the natural course of syphilis because of the profound defects in cell-mediated immunity it causes. The possible potentiating effects of HIV on Treponema pallidum infection suggest the need for lumbar puncture in the evaluation of HIV-seropositive patients with syphilis, as well as modifications of the currently recommended treatment regimens for primary, secondary, and latent syphilis and neurosyphilis in this patient population. Neurosyphilis should probably be added to the growing list of infectious complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and may be the first such complication to appear.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the hypothesis that altered binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) to parathyroid receptors might be involved in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure. The binding of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 to hyperplastic parathyroid glands obtained from seven patients with chronic renal failure was measured. These values were compared with those for binding to hyperplastic parathyroid tissue obtained from six patients who had received renal transplants and for binding to parathyroid adenomas removed from five patients who had primary hyperparathyroidism. We found that Nmax (an estimate of the concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors) was reduced (42 +/- 15 fmol per milligram of protein) in patients with chronic renal failure as compared with patients with transplanted kidneys (78 +/- 24 fmol per milligram of protein) and patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (114 +/- 30). Nmax correlated inversely with the severity of renal dysfunction, the serum level of phosphorus, and the logarithm of the serum level of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. These observations suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding by parathyroid tissue is reduced in chronic renal failure. This may contribute to the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism by reducing the inhibition by 1,25-(OH)2D of parathyroid hormone secretion. The low serum levels of 1,25-(OH)2D in chronic renal failure may accentuate this effect.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary angioedema is an inherited disease transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and characterized by deficient activity of C1 inhibitor, a glycoprotein that limits intravascular activation of complement. The unavailability of markers for the C1 inhibitor locus has so far precluded access to the genetic bases of the disorder. Using a recombinant-DNA probe for the C1 inhibitor gene, we identified a cluster of four distinctive DNA restriction sites in a multigeneration family. The strict cosegregation of these markers with a low C1 inhibitor level supports the conclusion that a defective structural gene is responsible for the disease. The occurrence of distinct DNA markers in patients from unrelated kinships indicates that, like forms of the condition displaying dysfunctional C1 inhibitor variants, those characterized by protein deficiency are also genetically heterogeneous. Although multiple restriction-site changes in the C1 inhibitor gene are carried by certain patients, DNA markers for this locus are strikingly infrequent among normal persons. These findings indicate that the gene alterations responsible for hereditary angioedema arise more often from DNA rearrangements than from nucleotide substitutions. Such variations in the structure of the C1 inhibitor gene may provide the basis for early and direct identification of persons at risk.\r"

As compared with 48 control patients with bacteremic pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, the 24 patients with penicillin-resistant pneumococci had a significantly higher incidence of use of beta-lactam antibiotics during the previous three months (65 vs. 17 percent, P = 0.0008), hospitalization during the previous three months (58 vs. 21 percent, P = 0.0038), nosocomial pneumonia (37 vs. 6 percent, P = 0.0032), episodes of pneumonia during the previous year (29 vs. 4 percent, P = 0.010), and factors on initial presentation that were associated with a poor prognosis (an initially critical condition) (67 vs. 27 percent, P = 0.0030). Their overall mortality rate was significantly higher (54 vs. 25 percent, P = 0.0298). Eleven of 19 episodes of pneumonia due to organisms for which MICs were 0.12 to 2.0 micrograms per milliliter, which were treated with penicillin G (10 episodes) or another beta-lactam agent (9 episodes), resulted in recovery (2 of 10 patients in an initially critical condition recovered, as compared with all of 9 not initially in a critical condition, P = 0.0012). Two patients who had penicillin-resistant pneumococci for which MICs were 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms per milliliter did not respond to ampicillin and ticarcillin therapy, respectively. Our study suggests that pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant pneumococci may occur more often in a population with some identifiable risk factors, and may respond to intravenous high-dose penicillin therapy if MICs are less than or equal to 2 micrograms per milliliter. Cases involving higher resistance may require an alternative antibiotic.\r"

We conducted a controlled study of this syndrome by analyzing clinical, electromyographic, and muscle-biopsy features in 18 patients with a history of poliomyelitis--13 reporting 1 to 20 years of new weakness and 5 without new symptoms. The patients with new weakness also reported new muscle atrophy (9 of 13) and fatigue (10 of 13), symptoms not reported by the controls. The age at the time of acute poliomyelitis, severity of poliomyelitis, residual disability, number of years since acute poliomyelitis, and age at the time of study were comparable in the weakening and control groups. Evidence of remote denervation consistent with antecedent poliomyelitis was demonstrated in all patients by electromyography or muscle biopsy or both. In addition, active denervation (as evidenced by spontaneous activity on conventional electromyography, increased jitter on single-fiber electromyography, or atrophic myofibers) was found in 12 patients in the weakening group and in all 5 controls. Immunohistochemical detection of myofibers expressing the neural-cell adhesion molecule corroborated ongoing denervation in both patient groups. When muscle data from both groups were pooled, correlations were observed between the extent of past reinnervation and the degree of ongoing motor-unit instability. We conclude that the extensive reinnervation of denervated muscle that occurs in paralytic poliomyelitis may be followed by late denervation of the previously reinnervated muscle fibers. Electromyographic and muscle-biopsy evidence of ongoing denervation does not distinguish between stable patients with prior paralytic poliomyelitis and those with new weakness.\r"

To study whether preexcitation syndromes could also be transmitted genetically, we determined the prevalence of preexcitation in the first-degree relatives of 383 of 456 consecutive patients (84 percent) with electrophysiologically proved accessory pathways. We compared the observed prevalence of preexcitation among the 2343 first-degree relatives with the frequency reported in the general population (0.15 percent). For 13 of the 383 index patients (3.4 percent), accessory pathways were documented in one or more first-degree relatives. At least 13 of the 2343 relatives identified (0.55 percent) had preexcitation; this prevalence was significantly higher than that in the general population (P less than 0.0001). Identification of affected relatives may have been incomplete because clinical information was obtained only about symptomatic relatives. Patients with familial preexcitation have a higher incidence of multiple accessory pathways and possibly an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Our data suggest a hereditary contribution to the development of accessory pathways in humans. The pattern of inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant.\r"

The enzyme dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) is essential for the maintenance of normal brain concentrations of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is itself required for the synthesis of specific neurotransmitters. This enzyme is also present in erythrocytes. We measured erythrocyte DHPR activity and concentrations of the biopterin derivatives of its substrate and of aluminum in 38 patients on hemodialysis who had no clinical evidence of encephalopathy. Serum aluminum levels ranged from 15 to 190 micrograms per liter (mean, 67.6 +/- 7.7) as compared with 4.9 +/- 0.99 micrograms per liter in normal subjects. DHPR activity was inversely related to the serum aluminum concentration (r = -0.61, P less than 0.001) and was less than the activity predicted from the hemoglobin concentration in these patients. Serum concentrations of biopterin derivatives were markedly elevated. Eighteen patients were given the aluminum-chelating agent deferoxamine in a single dose, after which DHPR activity doubled. These studies suggest that aluminum inhibits DHPR activity in erythrocytes and that aluminum chelation reverses this effect. Although we did not directly measure DHPR activity in the brains of dialysis patients without encephalopathy, we propose that the reduction in activity in erythrocytes may reflect a similar reduction in the brain. Our findings could help to explain the encephalopathy associated with aluminum intoxication.\r"

In this disease there is a progressive degeneration of most types of intrinsic neuron but somatostatin and neuropeptide Y levels are increased 3-5-fold. This may be attributed to the selective preservation of a sub-class of striatal aspiny neurons, in which these two peptides are co-localized together with the enzyme NADPH-diaphorase. Beal et al. reported recently that following intrastriatal injections of quinolinic acid in rats, medium-sized aspiny neurons were selectively preserved and they suggested that quinolinic acid which is found in human brain might cause the neuronal degeneration seen in Huntington's disease. We have used immunocytochemical and enzyme histochemical techniques to examine this selective toxicity but find no evidence to support this finding. We conclude that there are substantial differences between the immunocytochemical changes detected in postmortem Huntington's disease brain and those following quinolinic-acid-induced degeneration.\r"

PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele. To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes.\r"

To maintain a phospholipid bilayer in this organelle, newly synthesized phospholipids must be translocated to the lumenal surface. Consistent with this are measurements indicating that movement of phospholipids across microsomal membranes is rapid, with a half-time less than 5 min (refs 3 and 4). Rapid movement of phospholipids has also been detected across the plasma membrane of Bacillus megaterium, another site of de novo lipid biosynthesis. The rapid transmembrane movement of phosphatidylcholine has not been detected, however, in vesicles prepared from microsomal lipids. These latter data suggest involvement in the endoplasmic reticulum of a phospholipid-translocating protein, as was first proposed by Bretscher who called it 'flippase'. Here we report reconstitution of a phospholipid flippase from rat liver microsomes into lipid vesicles.\r"

  ".W": "As an approach to the study of the kind of chemical process that might have contributed to the origin of life, attempts have been made to develop purely chemical systems in which oligonucleotides self-replicate. Although performed oligonucleotides have been shown to facilitate the formation of their complements from activated mononucleotides, only a restricted range of oligomers are efficient templates and it will clearly be difficult to find a pair of complementary oligomers each of which will facilitate the formation of the other. Many of the difficulties facing the development of a self-replicating system could be overcome by using a pair of complementary substrate molecules that condense together more easily than ribonucleotides. It would also be helpful if each substrate molecule contained equal numbers of purine and pyrimidine bases as, otherwise, there is a tendency for purines to be overrepresented in the products. We have therefore explored the chemistry of 3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides and their dimers. We report here that the tetranucleoside triphosphoramidate GNHpCNHpGNHpCN3 acts as a template to catalyse the condensation of GNHpCNH2 and pGNHpCN3, forming further molecules of the template. The system is therefore autocatalytic, and in accordance with elementary theory the amount of product made increases with the square root of the template concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Ivermectin (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1) is a recently discovered, persistent, broad-spectrum, antiparasitic drug of unpredecented potency which is now routinely administered to cattle, horses, sheep and pigs in many countries. In cattle, it is an efficient control for parasitic gastrointestinal and respiratory tract nematodes, warble fly, mites, lice and ticks. However, most of the ivermectin dose is ultimately eliminated in the faeces of the treated animals where it has been shown to have an insecticidal effect on the larvae of economically important, dung-breeding, haematophagous Diptera. Nevertheless, the effects of excreted ivermectin on the cowpat fauna as a whole and the wider consequences of such effects have not previously been considered. In field trials reported here, the faeces of calves fitted with rumenal boluses delivering ivermectin at 40 micrograms per kg per day, failed to degrade in the normal way and this failure was associated with the absence of dung-degrading insects. Faeces from placebo-treated controls contained a characteristic dung-degrading invertebrate community and were largely degraded within 100 days. These results indicate that the increasing widespread use of ivermectin may have important environmental consequences for pastureland.\r"

  ".U": "87229036\r", 
  ".W": "It has often been proposed that one way of replacing degenerating neurons in the brain is to implant embryonic neurons of the same type. However, in the case of so-called 'point-to-point' systems, as opposed to the 'paracrine' systems which mainly involve local release of neurotransmitter, functional recovery requires a precise re-establishment of the missing circuitry. We recently showed that in one point-to-point system, the cerebellum of adult mice homozygous for the mutation Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd)2, missing Purkinje cells can be replaced by grafting cerebellar primordia from normal mouse embryos. Here, we present studies of the cellular mechanisms underlying this successful replacement. Grafted Purkinje cells leave the graft to migrate along stereotyped pathways to their final position in the deficient molecular layer, where they receive synaptic contacts from adult host neurons. Both the detailed timetable and the precise cellular interactions observed are remarkably similar to those occurring during normal development. Our results suggest that the deficient molecular layer exerts a selective neurotropic effect on neurons of the missing category, and that the embryonic neurons are able to respond to this signal during a period defined by their own internal clock. We also raise the possibility that embryonic Purkinje cells can induce in adult neural cells a new type of plasticity, that of recreating a permissive microenvironment for the integration of embryonic neurons.\r"

These variants did not contain any chromosome with a homogeneously staining region (HSR) and exhibited only a small average number of minute chromosomes per cell: these two types of karyotypic abnormalities generally accompany selective gene amplification. We now report that structures containing amplified DHFR genes in one of these variants (HeLa BU25-10B3) can be isolated by pulsed-field gradient or field-inversion gel electrophoresis as homogeneous DNA molecules of approximately 650 kilobases (kb). Electron microscopy of metaphase spreads from these cells reveals chromatin fibres with a similar DNA content, which are probably related to the above elements. These represent a novel type of extrachromosomal structures in mammalian cells.\r"

A monoclonal antibody (mAb35) raised against acetylcholine receptors from Electrophorus electric organ has been used to purify receptors from chick brain. These receptors do not bind alpha-bungarotoxin but have a high affinity for nicotine and antibodies raised against them block the function of acetylcholine receptors in ciliary ganglia. We have raised a monoclonal antibody (mAb270) against acetylcholine receptors from chicken brain (P.J.W., R. Liu, S. Shimasaki, F. Esch, B. Morley & J.M.L., manuscript in preparation), which has been used to purify a similar receptor from rat brain. Here we show that this antibody identifies a functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in rat-neuron-like PC12 cells which is probably not encoded by the cDNA clone (lambda PCA48) previously suggested as a candidate for the acetylcholine receptor gene. Additionally, we show that mAb270 binds to the same areas of rat brain as nicotine.\r"

It is not clear whether these sub-conductance states represent a partially-occluded open state (with restricted diffusion), or whether they indicate the presence of parallel conductive units. Here we present evidence for the presence of four parallel, equally-conductive subunits that make up a K-selective channel in the apical membrane of early distal tubule in the kidney of Amphiuma. The overall open probability of the channel is controlled by a main gate, the kinetics of which can be described by a simple two-state (open or closed) model. This main gate acts either to occlude or to expose the four subunits in unison. The subunits seem to gate independently both of the main gate and of one another, their open probability obeying the binomial distribution.\r"

Although formation of a benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) diol epoxide-deoxyguanosine adduct has been held responsible for biological activity, the more potent carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) binds extensively to deoxyadenosine residues in DNA, suggesting that hydrocarbon carcinogen-deoxyadenosine adducts may be instrumental in tumour initiation. Because the bay region diol epoxides of benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcPh) are very active tumour initiators, and the relative activities of the four configurationally isomeric 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxides (Fig. 1) are known, we examined their reactions with DNA. Each BcPh diol epoxide isomer exhibits a remarkable preference for covalent binding to DNA over hydrolysis, each yields a unique distribution of products with the nucleosides of DNA and each reacts extensively with deoxyadenosine residues in DNA. The relative tumour initiating activities of these stereoisomers is best reflected by the relative yields of one of the deoxyadenosine adducts formed.\r"

We show the good agreement achieved by different examiners in the evaluation of brain stem reflexes. Brain stem reflexes offer a slightly higher agreement (kappa = 0.69) than that of the study of motor response (kappa = 0.65). Within Parameters M and R, we observed less agreement in the evaluation of flexion responses and in the interpretation of oculocephalic reactions. The reliability of the evaluation of M and R parameters justifies the use of the Glasgow-Liege scale as a means for evaluating disturbances of consciousness.\r"

HBO therapy (100% oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute) was administered for 40 minutes during or after 6-hour occlusions and before, during, and after 24-hour occlusions. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 10 every 30 minutes before, during, and after occlusion and HBO treatments until it stabilized and then daily until the cats were killed 10 days after occlusion. The results were compared with observations in 13 untreated controls and 6 cats that received 100% O2 at atmospheric pressure during a 6-hour MCA occlusion. HBO therapy during the 1st or 3rd hour of a 6-hour MCA occlusion resulted in a four-grade improvement of the initial neurological function; this effect persisted during the remainder of the occlusion. The average grade of neurological deficit at death was 94% less than in the untreated cats (P less than 0.03). Infarct size in the HBO-treated group was 58% less than in controls (P less than 0.03). There was no significant difference in infarct size between the untreated cats and those treated with 100% O2 at atmospheric pressure. HBO therapy during the 4th hour of a 6-hour MCA occlusion had no statistically significant effect on infarct size, even though the mean neurological deficit was 73% less than in controls (P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.\r"

Experimental lesions were made in egg white and fresh meat at temperatures recommended in clinical practice. The cardinal finding was that lesions do not extend distal to the tip of the electrode. They only extend radially around the electrode tip in the shape of an oblate spheroid, with a maximal effective radius of only 2 mm. Consequently, if electrodes are directed perpendicularly onto a nerve, the nerve may not be encompassed by the lesion generated. Some of the clinical failures of percutaneous medial branch neurotomy (\"facet rhizotomy\") may be due to this phenomenon. We suggest modified techniques for medial branch neurotomy in which the electrodes are introduced parallel to the target nerve whereupon it is more readily encompassed by the radial spread of the lesion.\r"

No return of the evoked responses occurred within 4 hours after trauma in either the lidocaine- or the saline-treated groups. Loss of SERs and appearance of an evoked injury potential were sensitive determinants of spinal cord injury. We concluded that lidocaine treatment did not facilitate the return of spinal cord function in this model of acute spinal cord injury.\r"

Untreated animals consistently experienced severe acute intracranial hypertension. Pretreating the animals with lidocaine greatly attenuated the intracranial hypertension caused by air embolism. Lidocaine given after the injury was also effective in reducing intracranial pressure. Our results suggest that lidocaine may be a useful agent for reducing intracranial hypertension associated with ischemic or traumatic injuries to the brain.\r"

Thirteen individuals received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, whereas the other seven patients did not receive such specific antiischemic treatment. Five of the latter patients had an impaired CO2 response, and three showed delayed ischemic deterioration (DID), whereas none of the seven nimodipine-treated patients with impaired CO2 response showed DID. One nimodipine-treated patient with a preserved CO2 response, in whom operation was complicated, developed DID. The observed findings indicate that DID after uncomplicated early aneurysm operation may be associated with an early disturbance of cerebral vasoreactivity. Treatment with nimodipine may counteract the development of DID in patients with an impaired CBF CO2 response.\r"

We therefore examined the effects of a brief (30-minute), high dose (0.6 mg/kg/minute or 18 mg/kg total) infusion of pentobarbital in nine otherwise healthy patients (aged 20 to 30) scheduled to undergo operation for the removal of large or deeply seated arteriovenous malformations. Monitored variables included intravascular pressures, cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood gases and hematocrit, and the electroencephalogram (EEG). After a brief rest period and the collection of control data, pentobarbital infusion was begun, muscle relaxants were given, and normocarbia was maintained by mask ventilation. Because our primary intent was to examine the effects of the drug on the heart and arterial circulation, lactated Ringer's solution was infused continuously to keep pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at control values in an attempt to keep constant the ventricular \"preload\" (although PCWP is only an approximation of the true preload). Drug infusion resulted in progressive EEG suppression ending in a pattern of deep burst suppression (1 to 3 bursts/minute) at t = 30 minutes, with measured plasma pentobarbital concentrations (in four patients) of 34 +/- 4 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD). There were no changes in PaO2, PaCO2, or pH, nor were there any changes in PCWP. The cardiac index did not change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, because of various technical limitations, the use of MRI in head-injured patients has yet to be fully explored. With its precise anatomical sensitivity, MRI may be useful in severely head-injured patients in whom computed tomographic (CT) scans fail to demonstrate an anatomical substrate for the degree of coma. In this regard, a prospective study in severely head-injured patients was undertaken. Twenty-four patients with Glasgow coma scores of 7 or less who had minimal or no CT abnormalities and normal intracranial pressures underwent MRI as soon as their medical conditions allowed. In all 24, MRI demonstrated lesions that were not evident on repeated CT scans--suspected white matter shear injuries or contusions in 10, brain stem injuries in 5, diffuse white matter injury in 5, and subdural hematoma in 4. None of the 19 patients with the most widespread MRI abnormalities or the presence of brain stem injuries made any significant neurological recovery. Various prognostic indicators of the outcome of acute posttraumatic coma are continuously being developed. In this group of patients, the MRI scan is the most sensitive measure. Significant MRI abnormalities with normal CT scans and intracranial pressures were universally associated with vegetative outcome in this series. As we gain experience imaging neurotrauma, MRI may form the basis for a better in vivo understanding of the substrate for and natural history of traumatically induced coma.\r"

An 11 to 60% reduction in enhancing tumor volume was noted in 8 patients, 2 of whom had a greater than 50% decrease in tumor volume. One patient had no change in tumor volume 110 weeks after the initiation of BCNU chemotherapy. Four patients had tumor in more than one vascular territory; tumor growth was arrested in the perfused territory, but continued in the nonperfused area. In 1 of the 4 patients, tumor also grew along a shunt catheter tract and spread over the surface of the ipsilateral hemisphere. One patient developed clinically asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy after five courses of BCNU. Two patients had postradiation leukoencephalopathy before BCNU treatment. Seventeen patients had peritumoral low density with mass effect after BCNU; thus, the true incidence of BCNU-related leukoencephalopathy could not be determined. All patients experienced transient unilateral orbital pain during the infusion and scleral erythema that lasted for several hours afterward.

The cubicle shields the patient without restricting intensive care routines. The design specifications were confirmed by exposure measurements around the shield with an implanted anthropomorphic phantom simulating the patient situation. The cubicle reduces the exposure rate around an implant patient by as much as 90%, with the exposure level not exceeding 0.1 mR/hour/mg of radium-equivalent 192Ir. Evaluation of data accumulated for the past 3 years has shown that the exposure levels of individual attending nurses are 0.12 to 0.36 mR/mg of radium-equivalent 192Ir per 12-hour shift. The corresponding range for entire nursing teams varies between 0.18 and 0.26. A radiation control index (exposure per mg of radium-equivalent 192Ir per nurse-hour) is thus defined for individual nurses and nursing teams; this index is a significant guide to the planning of nurse rotations for brain implant patients with various 192Ir loads. The bedside shield reduces exposure from 192Ir implants by a factor of about 20, as expected, and the exposure from the lower energy radioisotope iodine-125 is barely detectable.\r"

All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively using a numerical scoring system that included clinical, motor, and sensory evaluation as well as nerve conduction studies. The Silastic material was well tolerated in the 70 cases. The overall 66% score improvement was more closely related to clinical relief (64%) than to improvement in motor conduction velocities (45%). Our 10-year experience indicates that ulnar neurolysis with Silastic envelope interposition is a safe surgical method of treatment for ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow.\r"

In contrast to the current reports that indium-labeled leukocyte scans can differentiate intracranial infection from tumor, these cases demonstrate their lack of specificity in the detection of brain abscess.\r"

  ".W": "Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial contamination of scalp wounds, indriven bone fragments, and brain tracks were studied in two groups (A and B) of nonrandomized patients with missile head wounds in a 20-month study of patients from the front lines of the Iran-Iraq war. In the 53 Group B patients, the primary debridements, most of which had been performed within 24 hours after injury, were deemed insufficient and a secondary definitive exploration was performed. Group A patients (62) had primary definitive explorations at Nemazee Hospital after a mean of 66.5 hours since injury. All of the patients had been started on dexamethasone and a combination of either ampicillin and chloramphenicol or crystalline penicillin G and chloramphenicol after field evacuation. The contamination rate of scalp wounds, bone fragments and brain tracks was slightly higher in Group A (38.4%, 22.2%, and 29.6% respectively, for Group A and 31.9%, 19.5%, and 27% for Group B, respectively). Staphylococcus albus among the gram-positive and Acinetobacter among gram-negative bacteria were the most common infecting organisms. Fifty per cent of the bacteria cultured from the brain tracks of Group A and 30.8% of those cultured from Group B patients were gram-negative. A total of 125 patients in four groups was included in our overall study of victims of missile wounds that violated the dura mater. Four patients developed meningitis at Nemazee Hospital (3 postoperatively and 1 after facial penetration). Two patients in Group B were admitted with meningitis (1 with an accompanying abscess), 1 of them 20 days and the other 60 days after exploration at two different centers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

She had been treated by carotid sacrifice for a giant intracavernous carotid aneurysm. After superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery bypass, this patient underwent a trapping procedure and decompression of her symptomatic giant aneurysm. Despite postoperative patency of her bypass graft, the involved middle cerebral circulation was irrigated substantially by retrograde flow through her posterior communicating artery. An incidental distal basilar aneurysm involving the origin of her superior cerebellar arteries, posterior cerebral arteries, and multiple perforators was treated by a wrapping procedure. Eleven days after carotid ligation, she suffered a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage from her basilar aneurysm. This catastrophe was undoubtedly produced by our failure to consider the additional hemodynamic stress placed upon the distal basilar artery by carotid sacrifice and may have been preventable by a more aggressive attack on this previously asymptomatic lesion.\r"

The basal metabolic rate of patients with myotonic dystrophy was significantly reduced when related to surface area (-9%), but elevated when related to lean body mass (+17%). Previous reports of hypometabolism in myotonic dystrophy did not take into account the amount of muscle wasting in this disorder, and we conclude that in myotonic dystrophy the basal metabolic rate is actually elevated when corrected for lean body mass.\r"
