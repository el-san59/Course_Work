Plasma chylomicrons were isolated at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after ingestion of the meals. Fatty acid patterns of chylomicron lipids were determined, and relative intestinal absorption rates of each fatty acid were estimated by comparing the fatty acid composition of chylomicron lipids with that of the fat in the meals. Overall, for both meals the fatty acid pattern of chylomicron lipids was very similar to that of ingested fat. Percentages of palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid, relative to other fatty acids, were only slightly lower in chylomicron lipids than in the meal fat. These data suggest that intestinal absorbability of stearic acid is similar to that of palmitic acid, and both saturated fatty acids appear to be absorbed almost as well as oleic acid (16:1).\r"

To determine if this effect is specific to saturated fat source and to measure changes in fatty acid composition of synaptosomal phospholipids, male Wistar rats were fed a 20% (wt/wt) soybean oil or tallow diet with 24% protein and 48% carbohydrate for 2 wk. Rats then self-selected from two diets with the same fat previously fed but different protein and carbohydrate composition (5% protein, 67% carbohydrate and 55% protein, 17% carbohydrate). Tallow-fed rats selected more protein and less carbohydrate than did soybean oil-fed rats. Dietary fat also affected fatty acid composition of synaptosomal phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine being most affected and phosphatidylinositol most resistant. Later studies determined if selection differences were due to taste. When rats self-selected without prior exposure to diets, tallow-fed rats selected more protein and less carbohydrate than did soybean oil-fed rats during the last 2 wk but not the first 2 wk. When rats selected from diets with identical protein and carbohydrate composition but different dietary fat, rats consumed slightly greater amounts of the tallow diet at each protein level. The relative intake of tallow and soybean oil diets, however, did not vary significantly with dietary protein treatment. These results confirm that rats fed saturated fat diets select more protein and less carbohydrate than do rats fed polyunsaturated fat diets and suggest this difference is not due to taste factors.\r"

  ".W": "Digestion and absorption of cocoa butter and palm kernel oil and their effect on cholesterol absorption were studied in adult male rats. Duodenal and thoracic duct catheters were inserted surgically into the anesthetized rats. After an overnight fast, animals were given a single duodenal dose of an aqueous emulsion containing [1,2-3H]cholesterol and one of the following: corn oil, cocoa butter or palm kernel oil. Digestion and absorption were estimated by recovering the total fatty acids in the thoracic duct lymph over a 24-h collection period (after subtraction of the baseline \"endogenous fatty acids\" in the lymph). Intestinal absorption of cholesterol into the thoracic duct lymph was reduced significantly (P less than 0.05) in the presence of cocoa butter, compared to absorption when palm kernel oil or corn oil was administered. Compared to the absorption of corn oil (arbitrarily defined as 100%), the absorption of palm kernel oil and cocoa butter was 82 and 63%, respectively. The present study suggests that palm kernel oil absorption was not significantly different from that of corn oil. The lower absorbability of cocoa butter and its inhibitory effect on cholesterol absorption may explain in part why cocoa butter is less hypercholesterolemic and atherogenic than other equally saturated fats.\r"

Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes (CD), hexanal and total volatiles (TOV) were measured in tissue homogenates incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h in the absence (uninduced) and presence of 15 microM ferrous sulfate (induced). The fatty acid composition of liver and kidney reflected that of dietary lipids. For uninduced peroxidation, there was in general a significant inverse correlation of TBARS, CD and TOV with the log of dietary vitamin E content for liver and kidney from rats fed either lipid. For induced peroxidation, the inverse correlation was significant for liver, but not for kidney, from rats fed either lipid. The correlation was generally higher for liver and kidney from rats fed COL than for tissues from rats fed MO. Vitamin E was thus a more effective antioxidant for liver than for kidney regardless of the dietary lipid, and for liver and kidney from rats fed COL than from rats fed MO. Dietary MO enhanced tissue susceptibility to both peroxidation systems. A simulation model developed to mimic the experiments showed good correlations between experimental data and simulated values.\r"

When rats were fed diets containing 18, 30, 45 or 60% casein for 1 wk, hepatic cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase activity (CSAD) decreased in a progressive and significant manner. Enzyme activity in rats fed a 60% casein diet was 25% of the activity measured in rats fed 18% casein. The time course of the change in CSAD activity was examined in rats fed a 60% casein diet. Within 24 h of switching rats from a moderate (18% casein) to high (60% casein) protein diet, enzyme activity decreased by 50% and continued to decline in rats fed the high protein diet for 7 d. The observed decrease in enzyme activity was reversed when rats were refed the 18% casein diet. The half-life of CSAD was calculated to be 2 and 7 d during the diet switch from 18 to 60% casein and from 60 to 18% casein, respectively. The change in enzyme activity was evident after a single high protein meal. In contrast to CSAD activity, urinary taurine excretion increased 140-fold within 2 d of switching rats from an 18 to 60% casein diet. Upon refeeding of the 18% casein diet taurine excretion rapidly decreased. These findings indicate that CSAD responds in a rapid and reversible manner to dietary protein.\r"

Soy and potato trypsin inhibitor (TI) concentrates were prepared from defatted raw soy flour and potato juice, respectively, by selective precipitation and ultrafiltration. Animals were fed a diet in which casein supplied approximately 20% protein. Each concentrate (less than 1% of the diet) was added to provide 100 and 200 mg of trypsin inhibitor activity per 100 g of diet. In short-term (28 d) experiments in rats, both sources of TI decreased the apparent nutritional quality of casein and produced pancreatic hypertrophy consistent with a hormonally mediated feedback mechanism for pancreatic adaptation to diet that is interactive with the nutritional status of the animal. After long-term feeding (95 wk), soy and potato TI produced dose-related pancreatic pathology in rats consisting of nodular hyperplasia and acinar adenoma, which was typical of that associated with raw soy flour. Although mice responded similarly to rats to soy TI in short-term (28-d) feeding experiments, they were resistant to the formation of these lesions following long-term feeding. This considerable species variation in propensity to develop preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the pancreas is not predicted by the short-term hypertrophic and hyperplastic response of the pancreas to TI.\r"

Effects of RPS and CPS on colonic function [fecal weight, transmit time and thymidine kinase (TK) activity (a marker for cell proliferation)] were contrasted in a 6-wk feeding study. Male F344 rats consumed either dextrose/sucrose (DS; control), 30% CPS or 30% RPS diet. RPS feeding resulted in a 3-fold increase in fecal weight and a 30% prolongation in transit time, as well as elevated levels of colonic mucosal total protein (50%) and TK activity (4- to 7-fold) compared to DS-fed rats. A second study revealed normal large intestinal histology in rats fed CPS or RPS, with elongated colonic crypts (33% increased over CPS) in group RPS. Large intestinal contents were heavier in group RPS than in group CPS. These studies demonstrate that RPS feeding significantly enhances fecal weight yet prolongs total gastrointestinal transit time. Enhanced colonic TK and elongated colonic crypts suggest that RPS stimulates colonic mucosal growth.\r"

Diet affected the fecal concentration of deoxycholic acid, beta-muricholic acid and total bile acids. Increasing dietary fat from 5 to 29% significantly increased the level of deoxycholic acid and total bile acids. An increase in dietary cellulose from 2 to 10% significantly decreased the level of deoxycholic acid, beta-muricholic acid and total bile acids. High levels of dietary starch (36 and 57-65%) did not significantly affect the excretion of deoxycholic, beta-muricholic and total fecal bile acids. Starch was able to bind bile acids in vitro and to affect the level of fecal free bile acids. In high fat diets, the level of free bile acids was lower in the feces of animals fed 36% starch diets than in those fed 3% starch diets. This reduction of free bile acids was accompanied by a reduction in colon proliferative activity. We suggest that free, rather than total, bile acids are the effective damaging agents for colon mucosa, and may represent a risk factor in the development of cancer.\r"

  ".U": "90095644\r", 
  ".W": "This study was conducted to determine in rats to what extent fermentable carbohydrates alter the mineral composition of cecal contents and the absorption of the major cations. The carbohydrates studied were as follows: an oligosaccharide (lactulose, 10%); a soluble fiber (pectin, 10%); and an amylose-rich starch, incompletely broken down in the small intestine (amylomaize starch, 25 or 50%). All of these carbohydrates elicited a marked enlargement of the cecum, a drop of cecal pH and an increase in the volatile fatty acids (VFA) pool. With the lactulose diet, the VFA concentration was the lowest, whereas VFA absorption was similar to that observed with the 10% pectin or 25% amylomaize diets. From comparisons between germfree and conventional rats adapted to a fiber-free diet, it appears that VFA are required as counter anions to maintain high concentrations of cations, especially sodium. In conventional rats fed fermentable carbohydrates, sodium concentration in the cecal fluid was approximately 80 mM, except with the lactulose diet (49.5 mM), due to osmotic effects of lactulose. There was, compared to the fiber-free diet, an increase in the cecal concentrations of potassium, calcium and phosphate, but not of magnesium; nevertheless, the cecal pool of all of these minerals was considerably increased. Potassium absorption was increased by fermentable carbohydrates in the cecum, which also appears to be a major site of magnesium and calcium absorption. Thus, fermentable carbohydrates shift aborally the absorption of the major cations, and this point is especially interesting in regard to calcium, since an enhanced supply of calcium in the large bowel has been invoked for fiber effects on colonic carcinogenesis.\r"

Two zinc absorption studies were performed with each formula (sequence: high-low-low-high). Extrinsically labeled formula was fed for 24 h and excreta were collected for 72 h. Zinc isotope ratios were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). When zinc intake was high, net zinc absorption was 9.1 +/- 8.7% (mean +/- SD) of intake and net zinc retention was 74 +/- 91 micrograms/(kg.d). True zinc (70Zn) absorption was 16.8 +/- 5.8% of intake and fecal excretion of endogenous zinc was 78 +/- 56 micrograms/(kg.d). When zinc intake was low, net absorption of zinc increased significantly (P less than 0.001) to 26.0 +/- 13.0% of intake, but net retention was not significantly different at 42 +/- 33 micrograms/(kg.d).

Thus, infants maintain zinc balance in the face of low zinc intake through increased efficiency of absorption and decreased excretion of endogenous zinc.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of zinc deficiency on membrane components that might be responsible for the increased fragility. Immature male rats were fed for 3 wk a zinc-deficient (0.5 mg Zn/kg) or a control (100 mg Zn/kg) diet either ad libitum or pair-fed. Red blood cell membranes were analyzed for zinc after wet ashing in nitric-perchloric acid. The fatty acid composition of membrane phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine was determined by gas-liquid chromatography, and the protein composition was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The membrane zinc concentration was decreased by zinc deficiency, but returned to control levels upon repletion with a zinc-adequate diet for 3 d. The increased osmotic fragility was also restored to the control level during the same repletion period, suggesting that zinc is an important determinant of membrane stability. The phospholipid fatty acid composition was altered by zinc deficiency, but these changes were not rapidly reversed by repletion. The membrane cholesterol:phospholipid ratio was also increased by zinc deficiency. Zinc status had no influence on the membrane protein profiles of the components visualized by staining. Only the concentration of membrane zinc correlated with osmotic fragility during zinc depletion and repletion.\r"

The relative positions of the two stable isotopic tags (67Zn, 70Zn) as extrinsic and intrinsic labels were reversed in two separate determinations of fractional absorption. Administration of doubly labeled formula for 24 h or less permitted elimination of unabsorbed labels before the end of a 72-h metabolic interval. The extent of enrichment and the kinetics of fecal elimination of unabsorbed extrinsic stable isotopic zinc tag were observed to agree closely with the corresponding values for the intrinsic tag. Fractional absorption of intrinsic and extrinsic tags was highly correlated and did not differ significantly. The ratio of fractional absorption of extrinsic tag to that of intrinsic tag was 1.05 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SD). The results constitute strong support for validation of the use of enriched stable isotopes at low levels (less than or equal to 10%) of extrinsic addition to milk-based diets for studies of zinc absorption by humans.\r"

Groups of eight rats were fed either a casein-based diet or a diet based on SPI. The acid-precipitated SPI was incorporated into diets as such, after neutralization, after 60% (v/v) ethanol extraction and neutralization, or after 60% ethanol exposure and neutralization. All dietary SPI was heat-treated by exposure to steam at 108 degrees C for 30 min. Rats were fed their respective diets, each containing 25 mg Fe/kg, for 13 d, and then all rats were fed a 59Fe-radiolabeled 2.5-g casein test meal containing 64 micrograms of iron. Ingested radioactivity was determined following the meal, and retained radioactivity over the subsequent 10-d period. Absorption was not distinguishable for groups fed the casein-based (78.3 +/- 3.6%) and the ethanol-extracted, SPI-based diet (80.2 +/- 5.4%). Absorption was lower (P less than 0.01) for groups fed each of the other SPI-based diets: SPI as such (68.3 +/- 8.9%), neutralized SPI (69.8 +/- 5.0%) and ethanol-exposed SPI (67.6 +/- 4.8%). An ethanol-extractable component of SPI may be responsible for decreased iron absorption by animals fed SPI prior to a radiolabeled test meal.\r"

However, in contrast to these studies, a simple comparison of the zinc binding constants for albumin and transferrin suggests a significant role for transferrin with regard to serum zinc transport. In the present study multicomponent equilibrium calculations that incorporate recently determined binding constants for zinc-transferrin as well as equilibrium constants for the binding of bicarbonate, sulfate and phosphate to apotransferrin have been used to model the distribution of labile zinc in normal human serum. Anion binding has a major impact on the predicted zinc distribution, lowering the percentage of zinc bound to transferrin from 56% to 11%. The model gives approximately 1% zinc as low-molecular-weight complexes. The improved model results are in good agreement with biological studies on the distribution of zinc among serum proteins.\r"

In study 2, weanling male rats were fed diets based on milk or lactose-hydrolyzed milk for 28 d or in one meal labeled with 45Ca. Rats fed the lactose-hydrolyzed milk rather than the untreated milk digested their diet more completely, apparently absorbed total calcium and 45Ca less efficiently, and lost more calcium in urine but retained similar amounts of total calcium and 45Ca in bone. The effect of lactose hydrolysis on the absorption of 45Ca was similar whether rats were fed only one meal of the milk-based diets or were fed the diets chronically. The rats fed supplemental lactose (study 1) or unhydrolyzed milk (study 2) retained more magnesium and zinc in bone.\r"

Screening experiments were conducted with different classes of phenolic compounds in both their native and oxidized forms. Pretreatment of vesicles with tannic acid (1 mg/ml) completely abolished the characteristic overshoot of active glucose accumulation. With chlorogenic acid (1mM), 80% of the glucose transport capacity was lost. Reductions of 30-40% were observed in vesicles treated with catechin, ferulic or caffeic acids. Treatment with gallic acid (1 mM) had little effect. Phenolic oxidation state did not exacerbate the degree of glucose transport inhibition, with the exception of catechol (1 mM), which gave maximal inhibition (86%) in its oxidized form. Gradient-independent glucose uptake was not altered, nor did phenolic treatment increase nonspecific binding of glucose to the membrane vesicles. Possible mechanisms of D-glucose transport inhibition were examined in chlorogenic acid-and tannic acid-treated vesicles. Factors such as alterations in vesicle permeability, size and leakage of transported glucose out of the vesicles were ruled out. Measurements of D-glucose uptake under conditions of Na+ equilibrium suggest that tannic and chlorogenic acids reduce glucose uptake by favoring the dissipation of the Na+ electrochemical gradient, which provides the driving force for active glucose accumulation.\r"

Hepatocytes of newborn rats appeared to be unable to maintain cellular carnitine concentration without carnitine supplementation. Moreover, ATP concentration and glycogen concentration were significantly increased by the carnitine supplement with oleate and/or lactate compared to the unsupplemented group. Increases in both intracellular ATP and carnitine concentration depended on the concentration of carnitine added to the medium.

Offspring from each litter size and diet group were separated from the mothers on postnatal d 30, subdivided into two groups each, and fed either the control or the high fat diet until postnatal d 77. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and ATP-citrate lyase activities in the offspring from large litters were elevated during the early stages of weaning but later lagged behind enzyme activity of the normal litters. Brown adipose tissue enzymes also surged earlier in rats from large litters but did not fall below the values attained by the normal litters until postnatal d 32. Enzyme activities on postnatal d 77 revealed that large litter size and high fat feeding during or after weaning were associated with diminished hepatic enzyme activities. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase activities also showed significant positive interaction between litter size and diet composition after weaning. Large litter size was also associated with diminished brown adipose tissue enzymes in the mature rats, but the composition of the weaning diet did not independently exert long-lasting changes in this tissue. Nevertheless, there was a positive interaction between litter size and diet composition during and after weaning. The data suggest that neonatal undernourishment can exert a long-term influence on the metabolic profiles of the animal, and that diet plays a role in modulating this influence.\r"

Methionine was essential during the first 18 h of culture, a period in which neural tube closure was initiated in supplemented cultures. All cow serum samples tested were found to require methionine addition, and the methionine was not replaced by other amino acids or vitamins, including folate. Methionine was not toxic to cultured rat embryos at concentrations up to at least 500 micrograms/ml. Analyses of serum free amino acids revealed lower levels of free methionine in cow serum compared to rat serum, and cow serum proteins contained less methionine relative to other amino acids than did rat serum proteins. Dialysis of cow serum reduced but did not eliminate the requirement for methionine. This suggested either that the free amino acids of cow serum were imbalanced or that a dialyzable component in serum interfered with the availability/utilization of methionine. Dietary supplementation of cows with rumen-protected DL-methionine increased the serum methionine level, and serum drawn from supplemented cows supported normal rat embryo development without additional methionine.\r"

Plasma and liver cholesterol and plasma triglycerides were measured, daily weight gain was determined, cecal weights were obtained, and gallbladder bile was scored by light microscopy and analyzed chemically for its lithogenicity and gallstone incidence. Lactose reduced plasma lipids, especially triglycerides, and hepatic cholesterol accumulation, and maintained a lower biliary cholesterol concentration. When fed at 30% or more, lactose reduced weight gain, increased cecal volume 2- to 4-fold and prevented gallstone formation. Diarrhea and death from 'wet tail' was associated with gallstones and was frequent in hamsters fed glucose without fiber, but its incidence was essentially eliminated by rice flour plus fiber or lactose. Under these experimental conditions of time and diet, estrogen supplementation was required for the formation of gallstones. These appeared to be pigment stones containing a minimal amount of cholesterol. In summary, pigment gallstones were induced in less than 8 wk in hamsters fed estrogen-supplemented purified diets. Lactose feeding improved lipid metabolism and reduced gallstone formation, apparently through its impact on large bowel metabolism.\r"

Screening experiments were conducted with different classes of phenolic compounds in both oxidized and native forms. The most potent inhibitor was native tannic acid at 0.1 mg/ml, resulting in an 80% loss of activity. Oxidized tannic acid had no effect. Significant decreases were also observed in vesicles treated with 0.1 mg/ml of catechol or epicatechin, yielding activity losses of 30-50%, regardless of oxidation state. With gallic acid, maximal (40%) inhibition occurred only in the oxidized form. Other phenolic compounds, such as ferulic, p-coumaric and caffeic acids, tended to be slightly inhibitory, while no inhibition was observed with vanillin or chlorogenic acid at the concentrations tested. These results confirm the enzyme inhibitory action of tannic acid, a polyphenolic compound, and also demonstrate that some individual dietary phenolic monomers have the potential to modulate enzyme activity in a brush border membrane vesicle model system.\r"

The digesta of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (digesta plus feces) were collected 12 h after fish oil intubation. Disappearance of total extractable fat was 95 +/- 1 and 94 +/- 1% for fed and fasted piglets, respectively. True absorption of the lipid was calculated from the disappearance of eicosapentaenoic acid and was 99% for both fed and fasted piglets. Nearly 50% of the stomach lipid was as diglycerides and free fatty acids, suggesting that hydrolysis of the fish oil was initiated in the stomach. Small intestinal lipid was 63-65% free fatty acids, indicating that the piglet pancreatic lipase was of sufficient activity to hydrolyze fish oil triglyceride. Neonatal piglets appeared to have ample capacity to digest and absorb fish oil, which supports the concept that lipid supplementation could improve the energy status of the newborn piglet.\r"

Four Macaca fascicularis monkeys underwent bilateral TMJ disc removal and high condylar shaves. One TMJ in each monkey was treated by grafting autogenous auricular cartilage to the glenoid fossa; the contralateral joint served as a control. Monkeys were killed at 6, 12, 16, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Viable auricular cartilage was found in all grafted joints. There was a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue surrounding the cartilage grafts, with some grafts being directly fused to the glenoid fossa. One joint showed significant fibrous connective tissue adhesions between the condylar surface and the inferior portion of the graft. Degenerative changes in the grafted joint appeared grossly to be less severe than in the control joints. The cartilaginous tissues appeared to be a suitable autogenous tissue graft, maintaining its viability and functioning as an interpositioning material between the condyle and fossa.\r"

To test this hypothesis, a 0.2-mm-deep incision 1 cm long was made in the right buccal cheek pouch of hamsters using either laser, electrosurgery, or a scalpel. Twenty minutes later, 1 mL of blood was taken from each animal by cardiac puncture, inoculated on a blood agar medium, and incubated anaerobically for 4 days; then the colonies were counted. Using an operational definition of bacteremia as five colonies or more per plate, there were no positive results out of 18 trials (0/18) for laser surgery, 7/8 for electrosurgery, and 8/12 for scalpel surgery. Based on the Student t test using the binomial distribution, the laser produced statistically less bacteremia than the other two methods (P less than .01). Because the five-colony cutoff was arbitrary, the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank test was also used. Colony formation from blood from the laser group was significantly less than from the electrosurgery group (P less than .01) and the scalpel group (P less than .05). The laser surgery group was not statistically different from the control (nonsurgerized) group. These results suggest that there is a considerable bacteremia following scalpel and electrosurgery, but that laser surgery produces no bacteremia.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental study evaluating the contributions of graft composition (particulate vs. whole) and revascularization (immediate reanastomosis vs. delayed) to cervicofacial fat transplantation was conducted in rats. Distant (inguinal fat) grafts were bilaterally transplanted to a muscular bed in the cervicofacial region as a free flap (anastomosis to carotid and jugular vessels) or as a free graft (either particulate or whole). Postoperative assessment was made by comparison of pre- and post-operative weights and histologic examination of all specimens, and by acrylic microangiography in select animals of each group. The fat flaps exhibited minimal loss of tissue volume, and showed a normal histologic appearance of the adipocytes and extensive vascular elements within the grafts. Conversely, considerable volume loss occurred in both the particulate and whole fat grafts. Histologically, the free graft was characterized by cellular disruption, atrophic adipocytes, and areas of acellularity. Whole grafts had histologic evidence of vessels located primarily at the periphery, whereas particulate grafts had increased intragraft vessels. Only the fat flaps showed observable intragraft vasculature by microangiography. These findings suggest that reduction of fat grafts into smaller components, eg, by liposuction harvesting, does not improve graft survival or decrease posttransplant resorption.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of an acute infusion of M&B 22,948 (2-o-propoxyphenyl-8-azapurin-6-one), a (cGMP)-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urinary sodium excretion in anesthetized rats. M&B 22,948 (at doses of 0.34-2.72 mg/kg/min for 30 min) lowered MAP in a dose-dependent manner, with a 60 mm Hg fall in pressure produced at the highest dose. Despite large decreases in MAP, a profound natriuresis was observed at all doses. Plasma concentrations of cGMP increased in parallel with the depressor action of M&B 22,948, whereas increases in the urinary excretion of cGMP temporally correlated with the natriuresis. The concentration of cyclic AMP in plasma increased transiently in rats treated with M&B 22,948 but the urinary excretion of cyclic AMP was not elevated in these animals. Because changes in cGMP correlated with the physiological effects of M&B 22,948, and the increase in cyclic AMP did not, it is likely that the depressor and natriuretic actions of M&B 22,948 are mediated by increases in cGMP. M&B 22,948 administered chronically at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg/day normalized MAP in spontaneously hypertensive rats; whereas MAP in vehicle-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats remained at hypertensive levels. cGMP-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors (like M&B 22,948) could be more effective antihypertensive drugs than currently available vasodilators because, when administered acutely, M&B 22,948 simultaneously lowers blood pressure and promotes sodium excretion in the anesthetized rat.\r"

Ester hydrolysis of either compound results in the formation of 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid which in rats is a major metabolite of these ergoline esters. The present study details the pharmacological activity of 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid and examines its relative contribution to the 5-HT2 receptor antagonism seen after sergolexole in rats. In vitro, 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid was a competitive antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors in the rat jugular vein, with a dissociation constant approximating 10(-7) M. After i.v. administration to pithed rats, 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid also antagonized the pressor response produced by serotonin, an in vivo estimate of vascular 5-HT2 receptor blockade. In fact, after i.v. administration, 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid was nearly one-third as potent as sergolexole. After i.p. administration, 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid was approximately one-tenth to one-thirtieth as potent as sergolexole. Likewise, 1-isopropyl dihydrolysergic acid antagonized central 5-HT receptors as measured by blockade of quipazine-induced increases in serum corticosterone concentration in rats and was approximately one-twentieth as potent as sergolexole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pial arterioles of newborn pigs were observed using a closed cranial window. Pial arteriolar constriction induced by topical acetylcholine (10(-5) M) was blocked by indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.), but was restored when acetylcholine was coadministered with topical prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha (1 ng/ml), U46619 (1 ng/ml) or PGH2 (100 ng/ml). The restored acetylcholine response was blocked by topical pirenzepine (10(-3) M), a muscarinic-1 antagonist. Constriction and ability of all three prostanoids to restore acetylcholine-induced constriction was blocked by SQ 29,548 (10(-4) M), a purported thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonist. Subthreshold concentrations of U46619 and PGF2 alpha (0.1 ng/ml) restored acetylcholine-induced constriction, whereas threshold and subthreshold concentrations of PGE2, platelet-activating factor and norepinephrine had no effect. Therefore, activation of the thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor appears to be necessary for acetylcholine-induced constriction to occur. Thus, prostanoids appear to play a permissive role in acetylcholine-induced pial arteriolar constriction in newborn pigs.\r"

Anesthetized dogs were given saline (n = 6), SQ 31,765 (n = 6; 0.2 mg/kg) or SQ 32,189 (n = 6; 0.2 mg/kg) i.v. 10 min before ischemia. The effect on pacing-induced ST-segment elevation (pacing + left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis) and myocardial blood flow were determined. SQ 31,765 reduced ST-elevation (P less than .05) compared to saline at 10, 40 and 70 min after infusion (5.9 +/- 1.4 and 12.0 +/- 1.4 mV, respectively, at 70 min). SQ 32,189, which is a 10-fold less potent calcium channel blocker in coronary arteries, did not affect ST-elevation (11.8 +/- 2.1 mV). Left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis during atrial pacing resulted in a significant reduction in subendocardial flow in all groups before drug infusion (41 +/- 7, 44 +/- 7 and 35 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g for saline, SQ 31,765 and SQ 32,189, respectively) and treatment with SQ 31,765 did not affect this flow. SQ 32,189 further reduced subendocardial blood flow such that it was significantly lower compared to saline. To test for any partial agonist activity, Bay k 8644 and SQ 32,189 were tested as constrictors of porcine coronary strips in vitro. Bay k 8644 induced appreciable force whereas SQ 32,189 did not. However, the vasorelaxant potency of SQ 32,189 was decreased under hypoxic conditions. Thus, SQ 31,765 can reduce the severity of ischemia in a manner which is independent of changes in myocardial blood flow or hemodynamic alterations.\r"

Distribution was modeled with three-compartment mammillary systems in which the central compartment corresponds to intravascular space and the two peripheral compartments have different rates of transcapillary exchange. Compared with results in intact dogs, the surgical procedure removed between 41 and 55% of the rapidly equilibrating tissues and reduced the permeability coefficient-surface area products for the rapidly equilibrating inulin and urea compartments proportionately. This is consistent with the concept that splanchnic organs equilibrate rapidly with inulin and urea because they are supplied by fenestrated and discontinuous capillaries that are prominent in the splanchnic vascular bed. However, splanchnic organs probably do not contain all rapidly equilibrating tissues, and somatic tissues may contribute as much as 36 and 22%, respectively, of the rapidly equilibrating inulin and urea compartments. Cardiac output averaged 2.87 +/- 0.86 liters/min and was similar to the sum of compartmental blood flows estimated from the intercompartmental clearances of urea and inulin (2.74 +/- 0.96 liters/min) and to the sum of theophylline intercompartmental clearances (2.62 +/- 0.74 liters/min).

Model predictions of the steady-state Cp-E relationship were then compared to results from actual steady-state drug infusions in the same subjects. Two methods of estimating the steady-state concentration response relationship from the single dose data were examined: 1) the relationship of descending limb Cp vs. E and 2) the relationship of estimated effect site concentrations (Ce) vs. E. When compared to experimental steady-state measurements, the absolute errors of predictions from the Ce vs. E method were less than those from the Cp vs. E predictions (6.8 +/- 4.4 vs. 9.6 +/- 6.6, mean +/- S.D.). Similarly, the slope of the linear regression of E on Cp differed more from the observed steady-state slope than the slope of E on Ce. Sigmoid Emax models fit to Cp vs. E. data gave false Emax values even when data immediately following drug infusion were disregarded whereas Ce vs. E plots demonstrated that Emax was not reached (and Ce much less than Cp). Neither the postinfusion (descending limb) Cp vs. E nor Ce vs. E plots allowed analysis of higher concentration vs. effect relationships after usual (0.15-0.22 mg/kg) doses of verapamil. In summary, we have demonstrated that nonsteady-state postdrug infusion effect vs. plasma concentration data for verapamil does not reflect the true steady-state relationship and that use of a model to estimate effect site concentration provides a closer estimate of the true steady-state relationship.\r"

In [3H]choline-prelabeled rat hippocampal slices, the mAChR agonists oxotremorine (EC50 = 15 microM) and carbachol (EC50 = 80 microM) caused atropine-reversible inhibition of [3H]ACh release up to a maximum of 80% reduction. The rank order of potency for antagonist reversal of this inhibitory action (N-methylatropine = atropine greater than scopolamine much greater than pirenzepine) was generally consistent with an M2 mAChR-mediated response although pirenzepine was ineffective up to 1 mM. Under these assay conditions, forskolin (1-10 microM) and 8-bromo-cAMP (30-300 microM) enhanced electrically evoked [3H]ACh release maximally by 50 to 60%; however, neither agent significantly reversed mAChR agonist-induced inhibition of [3H]ACh release. Additional studies were undertaken to determine the consequences of chemically uncoupling mAChR from their G protein-adenylate cyclase effector system in this tissue. Whereas brief pretreatment with the sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (30 microM) or pertussis toxin (1 microgram/ml) markedly attenuated carbachol inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in hippocampal tissue, there was no concurrent reduction of carbachol-inhibited [3H] ACh release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses, i.t., as low as 0.1 fentog of naloxone, 0.25 ng of beta-funaltrexamine and 0.1 ng of nor-binaltorphimine enhanced physostigmine, 2 micrograms i.c.v., analgesia. These doses of opioid antagonists did not inhibit spinal mu receptors or kappa receptor agonist-induced analgesia as assessed by absence of effect on Tyr-D-Ala2-N-MePhe4-Gly-ol5 or U50,488H i.t. analgesia. Enhancing effects of the opioid antagonists were interpreted to indicate that i.c.v. physostigmine-induced analgesia was mediated spinally by an endogenous opioid which had an antagonistic effect. This putative opioid antagonist was postulated to be dynorphin A (1-17). Thus, i.t. administration of small doses of less than 10 pg of dynorphin was shown to antagonize the analgesic action of physostigmine, i.c.v. Furthermore, this effect of dynorphin was attenuated by the doses of naloxone, beta-funaltrexamine or nor-binaltorphimine which were effective in enhancing physostigmine-induced analgesia. We concluded that physostigmine given i.c.v. had two actions, the first produced analgesia and the second activated a system which had an antianalgesic effect. Evidence indicated that the latter effect was mediated by dynorphin A (1-17). This concept of dynorphin action may be the basis for some of the unusual findings of the analgesic action of naloxone in other situations and support the concept for a descending dynorphin A (1-17)-mediated antianalgesic system.\r"

In daily sessions, monetary reinforcement was contingent upon correctly identifying by letter code, the drug administered; measures of drug discrimination included an operant procedure and a qualitative and a quantitative choice procedure. Drug effects were assessed concurrently on self reports and physiological indices. After acquisition of the discrimination, subjects were tested for generalization to: 1) a range of doses of the training drugs, 2) p.o. doses of the training drugs and 3) novel drugs. The discrimination was readily learned and all three discrimination measures were comparable. Discrimination performance, as well as self reports and physiological effects, remained stable over the course of the study, suggesting that tolerance did not develop in the daily session procedure. Testing with a range of doses of the training drugs resulted in dose-related effects in discrimination performance, physiological effects and self-reported drug effect. Oral doses of the training drugs resulted in partial generalization to the i.m. training doses, compatible with the attenuated subjective effects of the p.o. doses. Novel drugs (d-amphetamine, 10-20 mg p.o.; Lorazepam, 2-4 mg p.o.; and secobarbital, 100-200 mg p.o.) did not generalize to hydromorphone, but showed partial generalization to both pentazocine and saline. In general, drug-discrimination performance paralleled the patterns of self reports.\r"

Because these agents are detoxified largely by glutathione-dependent mechanisms, efflux of reduced glutathione and glutathione disulfide into bile and perfusate was measured, along with bile flow, excretion of endogenous bile acids, lactate dehydrogenase release and the bile/perfusate ratios of [14C]sucrose (a marker of junctional permeability) and [3H]polyethylene glycol-900 (a substance concentrated in bile, presumably by a vesicular transport pathway). All agents enhanced the rate of glutathione efflux from the liver, reflecting increased formation of glutathione disulfide. At low doses of the thiol-oxidants, most of the additional glutathione released by the liver appeared in bile, whereas at higher doses the fraction appearing in the sinusoidal circulation increased. This enhanced glutathione disulfide release was associated with a decrease in endogenous bile acid excretion and in the bile/perfusate ratio of [3H]polyethylene glycol, and an increase in the bile/perfusate ratio of [14C]sucrose. These deleterious changes were reversible, and were noted at doses that had no effect on lactate dehydrogenase release, and only small effects on perfusion pressure. Bile flow was decreased by t-butyl hydroperoxide and H2O2, and increased by diamide (100 mumol) and menadione (20 mumol). These results indicate that alterations in hepatic thiol-redox status lead to an impairment of bile acid excretion, junctional integrity and bile formation. These functional parameters appear sensitive to the effects of oxidizing agents, and probably contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatobiliary dysfunction during the metabolism of certain drugs and xenobiotics.\r"

  ".W": "In the domestic fowl, angiotensin (ANG) II causes a unique vasodepressor response in vivo and vascular relaxation of aortic rings in vitro that appear to be mediated by ANG II receptors. In initial studies using radioligand binding techniques, we identified specific vascular ANG II receptors in the fowl aorta. In the present study, we have characterized fowl vascular ANG II receptors in terms of binding specificity and their modulation by divalent cations and guanine nucleotide, to understand how the fowl receptor might differ from mammalian vascular ANG II receptors that mediate vasoconstriction. Competitive displacement of [125I] ANG II binding by ANG agonist and antagonist analogs revealed a unique pattern of receptor specificity, with the potency rank order: [Asn1, Val5]ANG II greater than [Asp1, Ile5]ANG II greater than [Asp1, Val5, Ser9] ANG I = [Asp1, Val5]ANG II much greater than [Val5]ANG III greater than [sarcosine(Sar)1, Ile5]ANG II greater than [Sar1, Ile8]ANG II much greater than [Sar1, Thr8]ANG II. Divalent cations (Ca++, Mg++ and Mn++) inhibited equilibrium radioligand binding by as much as 50% at 100 mM, with the potency order: Ca++ greater than Mn++ greater than Mg++. Mg++ and Mn++ stimulated binding very slightly (110%) at low doses (1-10 mM). The stable guanine nucleotide analog 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate inhibited equilibrium radioligand binding moderately (15% at 100 microM) in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, but failed to alter the dissociation rate of receptor-bound ligand (half-time = 10.92 min). These results suggest that fowl vascular ANG II receptors exhibit specificity and regulatory properties fundamentally different from those of mammalian vascular ANG II receptors.\r"

By using [3H]MCC (methylcarbamylcholine ) as a ligand for nicotinic receptors, competition studies at a fixed concentration of radioligand and saturation studies were performed with various noncompetitive inhibitors. [3H]MCC labeled high affinity nicotinic receptor sites in the rat brain at equilibrium. The sites appeared to represent desensitized nicotinic receptors, comprising a fraction of the total pool of these receptors. At micromolar concentrations, noncompetitive inhibitors interacted distinctively with [3H]MCC binding sites. Mecamylamine behaved as an allosteric inhibitor, as it decreased the apparent density of [3H]MCC binding sites. Tetracaine had mixed allosteric/competitive properties, reducing both the density and the affinity of binding. Chlorpromazine manifested a biphasic effect, increasing receptor density at concentrations of approximately 50 to 500 microM and reducing the affinity at higher concentrations. The results suggest that noncompetitive inhibitors bind to different, but interacting sites associated with desensitized nicotinic receptors in the brain, as well as to recognition sites for acetylcholine.\r"

After p.o. administration, AY-31,906 was 1.5- and 12.3-times more potent as a natriuretic than furosemide in rats and dogs, respectively, whereas it was 0.5- and 6.1-times as potent after i.v. administration. The maximum natriuretic effect of AY-31,906 in both species was similar to that observed with furosemide. At equiactive natriuretic p.o. doses in both species, AY-31,906 produced a greater increase in the urinary ratio of Na/K than furosemide, indicating a relative potassium-sparing effect. AY-31,906 produced significant increases in the fractional excretion of sodium and chloride in dogs at a dose that produced no statistically significant changes in the fractional excretion of potassium, glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. After p.o. administration, the onset of activity of AY-31,906 occurred within the 1st hr in both rats and dogs and preliminary data demonstrated that the activity lasted for approximately 2 hr in rats and 4 hr in dogs. Clearance studies in conscious dogs suggest that AY-31,906 inhibited electrolyte reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and, unlike furosemide, AY-31,906 had no activity at the proximal tubule. These results indicate that AY-31,906 is a potent, high ceiling diuretic with relative potassium-sparing properties. The compound is well absorbed after p.o. administration with diuretic activity occurring in the 1st hr.\r"

Increasing concentrations of Mg++0 produced a negative inotropic effect in electrically paced, left atrial muscle and decreased the sensitivity to arrhythmogenic actions of digoxin without affecting the maximum developed tension observed before dysrhythmic activity. Other signs of toxicity such as contracture were less sensitive to the antagonistic effects of Mg++0. Estimates of fractional occupancy suggested that the increased tolerance to digoxin-induced arrhythmias was mediated by an altered responsiveness to given levels of receptor binding. Experiments in partially purified membrane preparations demonstrated that elevations in Mg++ increased affinity for [3H]ouabain without affecting binding site density. Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity in these membrane preparations was also enhanced by Mg++; however, increases in buffer Mg++ concentration had no effect on the Na+-pump in intact tissue. In summary, these results indicate that elevations in Mg++0 act directly on myocardium to diminish the sensitivity to cardiotonic steroid-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, data suggest that this antagonistic action of Mg++0 is not mediated by alterations in receptor binding or Na+-pump reserve capacity.\r"

All three analogs caused a dose-dependent increase in urine flow by increasing free-water clearance without significantly changing osmotic clearance or sodium excretion, indicating true functional vasopressin antagonism. Peptides 1 and 2 were as efficacious in inducing a diuresis as SK&F 105494. The order of diuretic potency among the three analogs in vivo was the same as the order of potency determined by in vitro binding to rat renal membrane homogenates, suggesting that the analogs exerted their diuretic effect by acting at renal vasopressin receptors. Thus, noncyclic vasopressin analogs, which are easier to synthesize then cyclic structures, could provide new strategies in the design of drugs for the treatment of water balance disorders.\r"

CCK-octapeptide (OP) induced strong pyloric contractions when injected into the pylorus (threshold of 2 x 10(-13) mol; ED50, 8 x 10(-13) mol). Similar responses were obtained in the distal antrum (threshold, 6 x 10(-13) mol; ED50, 3 x 10(-12) mol) and the proximal duodenum (threshold, 5 x 10(-13) mol; ED50, 3 x 10(-12) mol). The nonsulfated form of CCK-OP was about 2 to 3 log units less potent in eliciting these excitatory responses in the pylorus (threshold, 9 x 10(-10) mol). Atropine shifted the dose-response curve of CCK-OP in pylorus, duodenum and antrum to the right suggesting a neural action of CCK-OP. However, an excitatory effect of CCK-OP was still present after neural blockade with tetrodotoxin i.a. Therefore, there was probably a muscular as well as a neural site of action of CCK-OP in these tissues. Systemic application of the novel CCK-antagonist CR-1392 in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg i.v. plus 100 micrograms i.a. shifted the dose-response curve of CCK-OP 1 log unit to the right without affecting the dose-response curve to acetylcholine. This dose of CR-1392 did not interfere with the pyloric motor responses to duodenal field stimulation or to intraduodenal acid infusion. These results demonstrate the dual peripheral action on nerve and muscle of CCK-OP in the pylorus in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exposure in superfusion to a depolarizing concentration of KCl (15 mM) evoked an overflow of aspartate which was almost entirely calcium-dependent. When added to the superfusion medium, dopamine (DA) and the selective DA D-2 receptor agonists quinpirole (LY-171555) and pergolide inhibited the K+ -evoked aspartate release in a concentration-dependent manner. The natural agonist DA was very potent (IC50 = 1 nM). The selective D-1 receptor agonist SK&F 38393 had no effect on the release of aspartate. The selective D-2 receptor antagonist S-sulpiride, but not the R-enantiomer, antagonized the DA-induced inhibition of aspartate release. The DA effect was unaltered by SCH 23390, a selective dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist. The findings that 1) the release of endogenous aspartate evoked by depolarization was calcium-dependent and 2) the release of aspartate was potently modulated through D-2 receptors are compatible with the idea that aspartate is released as a transmitter from striatal axon terminals. The possibility that aspartate and glutamate are coreleased from these terminals is discussed.\r"

Even in the rat, mesenteric arteries tested in vitro exhibited greater vasodilator responsiveness to UI than arterial preparations from elsewhere. In the rat in vivo, UI caused a preferential inhibition of alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction, but it was unclear whether this provided an explanation for selective vasodilatation. The present study was done in the rat 1) to determine whether the effect of UI on alpha-1 adrenoceptors differed in regional vascular beds and 2) to compare the inhibitory action of UI on these responses with that of the calcium antagonist, nifedipine. The inhibitory actions of UI were similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, in both the blood-perfused mesenteric circulation and hindquarters of the urethane-anesthetized rat. In both systems, UI produced a greater inhibition of pressor responses to a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, than to norepinephrine or a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine. Pretreatment with prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced the antagonistic action of UI on norepinephrine responses in both vascular beds in vivo and in the rat mesenteric artery in vitro. In contrast, prazosin potentiated the inhibitory actions of nifedipine on pressor responses to norepinephrine in vivo without having significant effects on the antagonistic actions of nifedipine on norepinephrine responses in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At first, the effect of indomethacin on the diuretic response to furosemide was re-evaluated in anesthetized rats. Indomethacin significantly attenuated the diuretic, natriuretic and chloruretic effects of furosemide without significantly affecting inulin and p-aminohippurate clearance or filtration fraction. But, in nondiuretic states, indomethacin had no significant effects on these parameters. Furosemide, ethacrynic acid and bumetanide significantly increased PGE2 production in cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (P less than .001), but not PGE2 production in the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubules. The effect of furosemide on PGE2 production in CTAL was dose-dependent, and higher concentrations of of furosemide than 10(-6) M significantly increased PGE2 production. On the other hand, chlorothiazide showed no PGE2 productive stimulation in these four nephron segments. This study demonstrates that the enhanced PGE2 production in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop by furosemide and other loop diuretics is one possible mechanism of these drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Compared to the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons, the mesocortical DA neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are able to sustain higher levels of release when driven at high stimulation frequencies. The effect of a well known activator of protein kinase C (PKC), 4-beta-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu), were compared on PFC and striatal DA terminals. DA release was monitored from slices of the rabbit PFC and striatum obtained from the same animal. The PKC activator, PDBu (30-1000 nM) enhanced the stimulation-evoked release (SER) of DA from PFC and striatum. The magnitude of the facilitation of DA release produced by PDBu was much greater from the PFC than from the striatum. In the striatum, PDBu produced a bell-shaped dose-response curve, i.e., 0.03 and 1 microM PDBu enhanced SER of DA by 25%, whereas 0.1 and 0.3 microM PDBu enhanced DA release by 60 and 100%, respectively (1 Hz, 120 pulses). In the PFC, 0.03 microM enhanced the SER of DA by 70% and 1 microM by 250% (1 Hz, 120 pulses). In addition, in the PFC, PDBu enhance the basal release of DA (+65% at 1 microM); this effect was not seen in the striatum. The inactive isomer, 4-alpha-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate (0.03-1 microM) failed to increase the SER and the basal release of DA from PFC or striatum. The SER of DA was dependent on the rate and duration of stimulation. However, under all conditions of stimulation studied DA release from PFC was always greater than from the striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Blockade of ventricular sodium conductance (gNa) is believed to play an important role in the beneficial antiarrhythmic effects of class I antiarrhythmic agents. The present study was undertaken to examine the importance of ventricular gNa blockade by assessing the antiarrhythmic profile of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a selective sodium channel blocker. Experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized and artificially ventilated rats. Two doses of TTX were tested for antiarrhythmic action: a low dose (low TTX, 10 micrograms/kg of bolus + infusion of 10 micrograms/kg/hr) which blocked only neuronal activity, and a high dose (TTXh, 50 micrograms/kg of bolus + infusion of 50 micrograms/kg/hr) which also produced signs of ventricular gNa blockade in normal hearts. To control for the decreases in blood pressure and heart rate caused by TTX, hexamethonium, nitroprusside and propranolol were also used. Only TTXh possessed antiarrhythmic activity in rats subjected to myocardial ischemia (produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery). Arrhythmia scores (mean, n = 9) were: saline, 3.8; hexamethonium, 3.8; nitroprusside, 3.2; nitroprusside + propranolol, 4.3; low TTX, 3.9; and TTXh, 0.9. Only TTXh reduced dV/dt max. of the action potential (recorded in vivo by means of 3 M KCl filled microelectrodes) as well as action potential height, and concomitantly prolonged the P-R and QRS intervals of normal hearts. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that drugs which produced hypotension, bradycardia and loss of autonomic function were not antiarrhythmic. On the other hand, the marked antiarrhythmic activity of TTXh appeared to depend upon ventricular gNa blockade. Thus, TTX provides a useful tool for examining the antiarrhythmic properties of ventricular gNa blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiological actions of paraoxon, an irreversible blocker of acetylcholinesterase, and their antagonism by a series of organophosphate cholinesterase reactivators, were studied in area CA1 of the guinea pig hippocampus in vitro. To avoid indirect effects elicited by excitation of CA3 neurons, the CA2/3 regions were removed routinely before the recording of extracellular field potentials in CA1. Under these conditions, paraoxon (1 microM) induced regular burst activity (rate, 2-10/min; amplitude, 0.2-1 mV; duration, 100-500 msec). The antagonism of this burst activity by atropine (0.3-1.0 microM) and pirenzepine (1.0 microM) suggested the involvement of muscarinic cholinoceptors in the mediation of this response. The reduction in frequency of paraoxon-induced bursting by the cholinesterase reactivators was taken as an index of their efficacies. The four oxime compounds tested were all active in the low micromolar range (rank order of potencies: obidoxime greater than HGG 12 = HLo 7 greater than Hl 6). In experiments without paraoxon, these oximes did not depress either evoked population spikes in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid or bursts induced by superfusion with Mg++-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, an unspecific inhibitory effect of oximes can be excluded. It is concluded that the in vitro hippocampus provides a suitable system for the quantitative electrophysiological evaluation of cholinesterase reactivators in the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Recent investigations have demonstrated the in vitro lipid mobilizing effects induced by alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist administration and have focused attention on the putative therapeutic interest of such compounds in the treatment of obesity as adjuvants in caloric restriction programs. We studied the impact of RP 55462 [6-chloro-4-(isopropylamino)-5-(methyl)-2, piperazinopyrimidine], a new alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist compound of the piperazinopyrimidine family, on fat cell function. The alpha-2-blocking properties of this agent, which had been defined initially on the brain were confirmed on adipocytes. RP 55462 competed with [3H]yohimbine binding sites on human fat cell membranes and inhibited the antilipolytic action of alpha-2-agonist compounds (UK 14304, clonidine and epinephrine) in human and hamster fat cells. It was also noticed that RP 55462 alone was able to activate lipolysis in isolated fat cells from various species (man, rat, hamster and dog). Moreover, the lipolytic response induced by isoproterenol or synacthene was largely amplified in the presence of RP 55462 in rat fat cells which are the least alpha-2 adrenergic responsive tested. RP-55462-dependent stimulation of lipolysis was not affected by the presence of other alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists (idazoxan, yohimbine or phentolamine). Intravenous administration of RP 55462 in alert dogs promoted an increment in plasma nonesterified acid concentrations reflecting its lipid mobilizing action. In summary this study focuses attention on a new alpha-2-antagonist compound which exhibits an in vivo lipid mobilizing action which could be attributable to its alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist properties. Inasmuch as the lipolytic activity of RP 55462, revealed in in vitro studies, seems to be independent from its alpha-2 adrenolytic properties; further studies are required to define the mechanism of such a lipolytic effect as well as its possible involvement in in vivo conditions.\r"

  ".U": "90095868\r", 
  ".W": "The in vivo lipid mobilizing effect of alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist has been demonstrated previously. This has attracted attention to the putative interest of such compounds in a lipid-mobilizing strategy. RP 55462 [6-chloro-4-(isopropylamino)-5-(methyl)-2 piperazinopyrimidine], a piperazinopyrimidine derivative, has already been shown to exert alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist actions on fat cell function in vitro. Moreover, RP 55462 exhibits a direct in vitro lipolytic action which is independent of its alpha-2-blocking potency. When administered i.v. RP 55462 is also able to induce an increment in plasma nonesterified levels in dogs. The mechanism of action of RP 55462 was studied and the nature of its lipomobilizing effect was explored. RP 55642-dependent lipolysis was not affected by beta adrenergic blockers on rat fat cells and RP 55462 had no direct effect on adenylylcyclase activity on fat cell membranes. Moreover, RP 55462 did not compete with [3H]phenyl isopropyl adenosine binding (A1-adenosine receptor agonist) on fat cell membranes. In fact, RP 55462 inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in rat adipose tissue. Several derivatives with the piperazinopyrimidine structure also inhibited cAMP-dependent PDE activity and exerted lipolytic effects. A short structure-activity study was performed with various derivatives. In dogs, by contrast with yohimbine, the in vivo lipid mobilizing effect of RP 55462 was not abolished by pretreatment with propranolol, and lasted longer. It is concluded that the in vivo lipolytic activity of RP 55462 is connected with its ability to inhibit cAMP-dependent PDE activity; a property of several piperazinopyrimidine derivatives. The lipid mobilizing effect induced in vivo by RP 55462 results from a combination of its alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist properties and its direct lipolytic action mediated by cAMP-dependent PDE inhibiting effects.\r"

The rank order of potency for causing vasoconstriction was: alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (alpha,beta-meATP) greater than beta,gamma-methylene-ATP (beta,gamma-meATP) greater than 2-methylthio-ATP (2m.S.ATP) greater than ATP for arteries; and alpha,beta-meATP much greater than beta,gamma-meATP = 2m.S.ATP greater than ATP for veins, indicating that a P2x receptor was involved. The contractile response to these analogs was virtually abolished after desensitization of P2x-receptors by alpha,beta-meATP. Removal of the endothelial cells enhanced the contractile responses to all of the ATP analogs in both arteries and veins. The rank order of potency for vasodilatation was 2m.S.ATP much greater than ATP = beta,gamma-meATP much greater than alpha,beta-meATP for arteries and 2m.S.ATP much greater than ATP = beta-gamma-meATP, with alpha,beta-meATP being no effect for veins, indicating a P2y receptor. Pretreatment of the pulmonary arteries with the P2y-antagonist reactive blue 2 caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curves to 2m.S.ATP, ATP and beta,gamma-meATP. Reactive blue 2 was only used with the pulmonary arteries. Removal of the endothelium converted the relaxant responses to all the ATP analogs (except to ATP in pulmonary artery) to further contraction. In the pulmonary artery, the small endothelium-independent relaxation induced by ATP was abolished completely by pretreating the vessels with 100 microM theophylline (a P1-purinoceptor antagonist), suggesting that it was due to conversion of ATP to adenosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90095871\r", 
  ".W": "An isolated recirculating or single pass red cell-perfused rat kidney preparation (IPK) was used to examine the differential handling of renal metabolites. In single pass experiments, enalapril was primarily metabolized to its polar, dicarboxylic acid metabolite, enalaprilat, and its fractional excretion (FE) was less than unity, suggesting net reabsorption. Its steady-state extraction ratio decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 at concentrations of 1.06 to 12.7 microM, due to a saturation of enzymes for esterolysis. Enalaprilat administered to the IPK was excreted into urine in a concentration-independent (0.41-35.3 microM) fashion, with FE values approximating unity, suggesting net filtration. Differences in handling were observed for enalaprilat, as a metabolite formed from enalapril and as an administered (preformed) species in the single pass IPK, when tracer concentrations of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat were given simultaneously. A comparison made between steady-state extraction ratio Ess[mi] [generated metabolite]/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and Ess[pmi] [preformed metabolite]/GFR, respectively, revealed a 2-fold difference. The finding suggests the presence of a barrier for entry of enalaprilat into the kidney. Or else, in absence of the barrier, the opposite would be observed, that is, Ess [pmi]/GFR greater than Ess [mi]/GFR because preformed enalaprilat, in contrast to generated enalaprilat, undergoes filtration and utilizes facilitative transport carriers at the basolateral membrane. In recirculating IPKs which received simultaneously a tracer bolus dose of [14C]enalapril and [3H]enalaprilat, the FE values for generated [14C]enalaprilat were high and variable, decreasing with perfusion time and exceeding those for preformed [3H]enalaprilat, which approached unity with perfusion time. The variable FE values for [14C]enalaprilat are due to time-dependent contributions of circulating enalaprilat (which behaves identically to preformed enalaprilat) and the intrarenally generated enalaprilat. Hence, with renal drug metabolism, the conventional method of estimating urinary clearance (or Fe[mi]) for the metabolite [(total) excretion rate/midpoint plasma FE[mi] metabolite concentration] results in a greater metabolite clearance than that predicted from the administration of preformed metabolite.\r"

The effects were obtained when both polypeptide chains of the toxin were added to cells at 37 degrees C; the effects were inhibited by low temperature (4 degrees C) and by sodium azide (15 mM). Attachment of the heavy polypeptide chain to cells before the light polypeptide chain was necessary to produce cell poisoning. When cells were maintained at 4 degrees C, the receptor-bound heavy chain remained at the cell surface and accessible to the light chain. When cells were maintained at 37 degrees C, the receptor-bound heavy chain was internalized and no longer accessible to light chain. Drugs that antagonize receptor-mediated endocytosis, such as ammonium chloride and methylamine hydrochloride, inhibited internalization of the heavy chain-light chain complex. These drugs did not antagonize receptor binding by the heavy chain or did they inhibit mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation in broken cells by the light chain. However, they did diminish the amount of mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation produced by holotoxin in intact cells. The data indicate that receptor-mediated endocytosis is an essential step in the ability of the toxin to poison cells.\r"

  ".W": "The protective effects of a series of stable adenosine analogs against generalized seizures initiated by focal injection of bicuculline methiodide into the rat prepiriform cortex (PPC) were studied by microinjection of these compounds into this brain area. The adenosine agonists, 5'-N-(ethyl)carboxamido-adenosine (NECA), cyclohexyladenosine, cyclopentyadenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and R- and S-phenylisopropyladenosine (R- and S-PIA), protected animals against seizures in a dose-dependent, and extremely potent manner. NECA, the most potent compound evaluated, completely prevented seizures at doses greater than or equal to 6.8 pmol. In contrast, heroic doses of the A2 selective ligand, 2-phenylaminoadenosine, afforded no protection against seizures. The rank order of potency of these compounds in suppressing seizures is as follows: NECA greater than cyclohexyladenosine greater than cyclopentyladenosine greater than or equal to R-PIA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than S-PIA much greater than 2-phenylaminoadenosine. These data suggest that the antiseizure activity of these compounds in the PPC results from activation of A1 adenosine receptors. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of the distribution of tritiated adenosine agonists 30 min after microinjection in the PPC reveals that [3H]NECA diffuses to a significantly greater extent than R-[3H]PIA, which may contribute to the relatively greater potency of the former compound in suppressing bicuculline methiodide-induced seizures. These results suggest that adenosine A1 receptors may participate in the normal inhibitory regulation of the PPC, a forebrain area which may play a significant role in the pathobiology of epilepsy.\r"

However, it is not yet clear whether these putative tubular DA-1 receptors are involved in the functional renal responses elicited during the administration of DA and DA receptor agonists. In the present study we have examined the renal effects of several doses of selective DA-1 receptor agonist fenoldopam in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats in an attempt to unmask a direct tubular DA-1 receptor-mediated diuresis and natriuresis. Additionally, we have performed receptor-ligand binding and autoradiographic studies to examine the presence and localization of DA-1 receptors in various regions of the rat kidney. At the highest dose studied (2 micrograms/kg/min), fenoldopam produced diuresis and natriuresis, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in blood pressure and also a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate. At 1 micrograms/kg/min, the diuretic and natriuretic effects of fenoldopam were observed in the absence of any changes in blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate, but there was a significant increase in renal blood flow. However, at 0.5 micrograms/kg/min, fenoldopam-induced natriuresis and diuresis was not accompanied by any changes in blood pressure, renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, implying a direct tubular effect. These effects of fenoldopam appear to be mediated via activation of DA-1 receptors, because they were antagonized by the selective DA-1 antagonist SCH 23390.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atropine and gallamine bind different muscarinic binding sites. We thus investigated the blocking effects of atropine and gallamine on the negative chronotropic and dromotropic responses to stimulation of the vagus nerves. We stimulated the intracardiac vagus nerves to the SA nodal area (sinoatrial fat pad stimulation) or to the atrioventricular nodal area (atrioventricular fat pad stimulation). Sinoatrial fat pad stimulation increased the sinus cycle length. Atrioventricular fat pad stimulation increased atrioventricular conduction time without affecting the cycle length. Atropine inhibited the chronotropic response to sinoatrial fat pad stimulation and the dromotropic response to atrioventricular fat pad stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. The ID50 for the chronotropic responses was less than that for the dromotropic responses. In contrast, gallamine inhibited the chronotropic and dromotropic responses in a similar dose-dependent manner. Physostigmine potentiated the chronotropic and dromotropic responses similarly but it did not change the blocking effects of atropine on the cardiac responses. These results suggest that the binding properties of the muscarinic receptors to the antagonists on the sinoatrial node are different from those on the atrioventricular node in the heart.\r"

A highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, ICS 205-930 [(3-alpha-tropanyl)1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester], inhibited the effect of both agonists with a pKB value characteristic of 5-HT3 receptors. 5-HT-evoked DA release was resistant to antagonism by methiothepin and methysergide, antagonists at 5-HT 1-like and 5-HT2 receptors. Neither (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane, the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist, nor 5-carboxamidotryptamine, the selective 5-HT 1-like receptor agonist, altered DA release. The release of DA by 5-HT3 stimulation was Ca++-dependent and partially sensitive to tetrodotoxin. 5-HT and 2-methyl-5-HT also increased K+-evoked DA release. These observations constitute direct, unambiguous evidence that in rat striatum 5-HT3 receptors modulate release of DA.\r"

All three compounds (217MI, 1-10 microM; 217AO, 1-25 microM; and Tetram, 1-50 microM) decreased the rate of e.p.c. decay (alpha) to the same extent as neostigmine (10 microM), a reversible anticholinesterase agent. Decay remained a single exponential at all membrane potentials. 217MI and its derivatives greatly reduced the normal voltage dependence of alpha represented by the slope (H = mV-1) of log alpha vs. membrane potential, in contrast to neostigmine which had no effect on H. Suppression of Ach release by the addition of 4 mM Mg++ to end-plates did not alter the reduction of H by 217AO indicating that the anticholinesterase-induced decrease in H is not simply due to an increased interaction between Ach and its receptors. Additionally, the pretreatment of end-plates with methanesulfonyl fluoride, also an irreversible cholinesterase agent, did not modify the effects of 217AO and Tetram on H. 217MI and its derivatives, at low concentrations which altered H, did not affect [3H]PCP or [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding to Torpedo californica Ach receptor-rich membranes. It is concluded that these agents alter H by an effect on the Ach receptor ion channel complex unrelated to either esterase inhibition or channel block.\r"

We used DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid to inhibit kininase I, enalaprilat for ACE, phosphoramidon for neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-prolinal for postproline cleaving enzyme. Bradykinin was added to rat plasma and incubated at 37 degrees C. Kininase activity was evaluated based on the decrease in bradykinin during incubation. Bradykinin was measured by radioimmunoassay, using an antibody that recognizes its carboxyl group. Of the total plasma kininase activity, carboxypeptidase N was responsible for 11.0 +/- 2.5% (N = 5; P less than .05) and ACE for 46.8 +/- 1.5% (N = 5; P less than .001), whereas the contribution of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and postproline cleaving enzyme turned out to be negligible. Of the kininase activity in rat plasma, 42% could not be explained by any of these four enzymes. We concluded that ACE is responsible for most of the kininase activity in rat plasma; carboxypeptidase N contributes to a slight degree. The fact that 42% of total plasma kininase activity could not be explained by any of the enzymes tested suggests that there are still other kininases in rat plasma which remain to be discovered.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to determine if the endogenous cationic protein, e.g., histone, is capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Calf thymus histone was iodinated with [125I]iodine and was found to be taken up rapidly by isolated bovine brain capillaries used as an in vitro model system of the BBB via a time- and temperature-dependent mechanism. The binding was saturable and a Scatchard plot of the binding data was linear, yielding a KD = 15.2 +/- 2.8 microM and a maximal binding = 7.7 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg of protein. Other polycations such as protamine or polylysine markedly inhibited uptake of [125I] histone, but cationized albumin demonstrated minimal inhibition and cationized immunoglobulin caused no inhibition of bovine brain capillary uptake of [125I]histone. The in vivo brain VD of [125I] histone reached 159 +/- 70 microliters/g by 10 min of carotid arterial perfusion as compared to the 10-min VD for [3H]albumin, 17 +/- 7 microliter/g. Most of this uptake represented sequestration by the vasculature, but approximately 8% of the total histone taken up by brain was found to be transported unmetabolized (based on trichloroacetic acid precipitability of brain supernatant [( 125I]) into brain interstitium. These studies demonstrate that histone is transported through the BBB in vivo via absorptive-mediated transport. Thus, histone is an endogenous protein that is capable of transport through the BBB and may be a potential vector for pharmaceutical delivery through the BBB.\r"

  ".W": "Fluid overload and dehydration are potentially serious physiologic perturbations. Their effects on the pharmacodynamics of drugs are essentially unknown. This investigation was designed to determine the effects of acute fluid overload or water deprivation on the hypnotic activity of phenobarbital and on the neurotoxicity of theophylline in male Lewis rats. In the first experiment, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) was infused i.v. in an amount equal to 5 or 10% of body weight and phenobarbital was infused immediately thereafter until the onset of loss of righting reflex (LRR). The total infused dose and the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of phenobarbital at that time were significantly lower than in control animals. When phenobarbital was infused about 2.5 hr after D5W, the infused dose and the serum and CSF concentrations of phenobarbital at LRR were normal. When the rats received D5W and an injection of vasopressin, 25 I.U./kg, or vasopressin only, the infused dose and the serum and CSF concentrations of phenobarbital at LRR were significantly lower than in controls despite the 2.5-hr interval between the respective pretreatments and the phenobarbital infusion. Water deprivation for 24 or 48 hr had no significant effect on phenobarbital dose and concentrations at LRR. Intravenous infusion of D5W to 10% of body weight immediately or 2.5 hr before theophylline infusion had no significant effect on the total infused dose and the serum and CSF concentrations of theophylline at onset of maximal seizures. This lack of effect occurred despite appreciable hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia immediately after D5W infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Behavioral evidence indicates that the potent rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated, in part, by the mesoaccumbens dopamine (DA) system projecting from A10 DA cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Previous electrophysiological studies from our laboratory have indicated that cocaine (i.v.) exerts inhibitory effects on A10 DA neurons, due to enhanced stimulation by DA at DA autoreceptors are well as by activation of NAc-VTA feedback pathways. In the present experiments, extracellular single-unit recording and microiontophoretic techniques were used to determine the possible alterations in the mesoaccumbens DA system after repeated cocaine administration. Twice daily injections of cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p., 14 days) caused significant subsensitivity to the inhibitory effects of low i.v. doses of the DA agonist apomorphine in comparison to rats receiving similar treatments with saline or procaine. Iontophoretic application of DA to A10 DA neurons in rats treated repeatedly with cocaine (2X10 mg/kg, 14 days) also produced significantly less inhibition as compared to control rats. Cell population analysis of the VTA revealed that autoreceptor subsensitivity in cocaine-treated rats resulted in a significantly greater number of spontaneously active A10 DA neurons, and a significantly higher firing rate as compared to A10 DA neurons in control rats. In striking contrast to A10 DA cells, recordings from NAc neurons in cocaine-treated rats (2X10 mg/kg, 14 days) indicated that these cells were supersensitive to the inhibitory effects of iontophoretic DA. Although the mechanism underlying such supersensitivity remains unclear, the increased sensitivity of postsynaptic NAc DA receptors combined with the subsensitivity of A10 DA autoreceptors could lead to greatly enhanced DA transmission and may help to explain some aspects of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization.\r"

Both (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [(+)-3-PPP] and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) inhibited the hyperpolarization induced by a ligand-activated potassium conductance. In the locus ceruleus, (+)-3-PPP and DTG produced a maximal 40 to 45% inhibition of the [Met5]enkephalin hyperpolarization, and had EC50 values of 6.6 and 2.2 microM, respectively. In the submucous plexus, the two compounds had a similar action on the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist UK14304 hyperpolarization, producing a maximal 50% inhibition with EC50 values of 140 and 32 nM, respectively. In addition, DTG inhibited the alpha-2-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential in both preparations. In contrast, (+)-3-PPP increased and prolonged the inhibitory postsynaptic potential. This action is qualitatively similar to the actions of cocaine on locus ceruleus and submucous plexus neurons. Haloperidol (1-10 microM) shared none of these actions. It is concluded that DTG and (+)-3-PPP are inhibitors of the opiate and alpha-2-mediated hyperpolarization at a postreceptor site, possibly the potassium channel. In addition, (+)-3-PPP, but not DTG, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. None of these effects appear to be related to the sigma -binding site, because haloperidol acted as neither an agonist nor an antagonist.\r"

NPY reportedly can influence vascular neuroeffector transmission in both negative and positive directions. Mechanisms by which NPY effects are exerted and their relative contribution may vary between different blood vessels. Therefore, we investigated effects of NPY on adrenergic neurotransmission in ring segments of the rat tail artery by measuring isometric force development and [3H]norepinephrine release. NPY (1-100 nM) potentiated responses to transmural nerve stimulation (3 Hz, six pulses) by more than 300% but produced no direct contractile effects. NPY potentiated responses to longer transmural nerve stimulation trains (30-100 pulses) or to exogenous norepinephrine by only 30%. NPY had no effect on [3H]norepinephrine overflow with either short (six pulses) or long (30 pulses) stimulation trains. Contractile responses to transmural nerve stimulation were completely blocked by prazosin (10(-7) M) both in the absence and presence of NPY. Since the impact of an increased rate of contraction on the contractile response achieved would be greater with short stimulation trains, the effect of NPY on contraction rate was analyzed. NPY increased the rate of contraction to both norepinephrine and transmural nerve stimulation. It is hypothesized that NPY increases the early (phasic) component of the contractile response by preferentially influencing release of intracellular calcium stores. These findings suggest that the effects of NPY will be more profound on phasic rather than sustained patterns of nerve traffic.\r"

Techniques which analyzed the trial-to-trial sequential and serial dependence underlying the variance in evoked potential amplitude were utilized. Waveforms of averaged tone-evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded from the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (OM) were subjected to principal components analysis which revealed eight principal components accounting for 90.3% of the total variance in the set of OM AEP waveforms. Five of the eight components were altered significantly in comparison to vehicle injection sessions after administration of either a 1.0- or 2.0-mg/kg dose of delta-9-THC. These alterations accounted for the amplitude and latency changes in the OM AEP described in a previous report. In addition, delta-9-THC also disrupted the trial-to-trial sequential dependency of the OM AEPs. An important result showed that delta-9-THC selectively influenced the serial dependence of the OM AEP. These results implicate delta-9-THC as a potent disruptor of temporally specific information as it is processed by the hippocampus and suggest that such disruption may be the basis of delta-9-THC effects on memory processes in humans.\r"

These data support the idea that alpha-1 receptor subtypes exist and only one is sensitive to alkylation by SZL-49. In the present study male rats were injected (i.p.) with SZL-49 (0.5-30 mg/kg) and the effects on [3H]prazosin binding, systemic arterial blood pressure and the pressor response to phenylephrine were assessed 24 hr later. SZL-49 treatment decreased the number of [3H]prazosin sites without affecting receptor affinity. The maximal reduction in binding sites was 60% (32 fmol/mg). At doses of 0.5-, 1-, 5- and 10-mg/kg SZL-49 reduced the receptor number to the same level (83 fmol/mg control; 47-60 fmol/mg treated). Injection of SZL-49 had no effect on resting blood pressure. However, drug treatment (0.5 mg/kg and greater) shifted the phenylephrine dose-response curve to the right. The maximal 1-, 5- and 10-mg/kg SZL-49, the ED50 for phenylephrine was approximately the same. Therefore, over a 20-fold range of SZL-49 concentrations no further reduction in receptor number or phenylephrine ED50 was observed. These data support the idea that S2L-49-sensitive and resistant alpha-1 receptors exist in vivo. The alkylation resistant receptor is capable of maintaining resting blood pressure. Furthermore, both receptors appear to be involved in mediating the increase in blood pressure observed with phenylephrine.\r"

This effect was antagonized by yohimbine (0.03-1 mg/kg i.p.), but not by prazosin (1 mg/kg i.p.). The inhibition by yohimbine was biphasic. The cGMP response to clonidine was inhibited by atropine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and methylatropine (0.2-5 mg/kg i.p.). In mice pretreated with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, the cGMP response to clonidine persisted. St-91 [(2,6-diethylphenylamino)-2-imidazoline] (0.39-3.94 mumol/kg i.p.), a cogener of clonidine which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, also increased myocardial cGMP content. The potency of clonidine was similar in mice pretreated and nonpretreated with hexamethonium. Methylatropine did not affect the cGMP response to St-91 and to clonidine in ganglionectomized mice and yohimbine was a less potent antagonist. These results indicate that systemic administration of clonidine produces an increase in myocardial cGMP content by both a central and a peripheral action. The increase in cGMP can be due to a direct activation of cardiac prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors and to stimulation of cardiac muscarinic receptors, a response secondary to an action of clonidine on central alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".U": "90095889\r", 
  ".W": "Characterization of the adenosine A2 receptor has been limited due to the lack of available ligands which have high affinity and selectivity for this adenosine receptor subtype. In the present study, the binding of a highly A2-selective agonist radioligand, [3H]CGS 21680 (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine) is described. [3H]CGS 21680 specific binding to rat striatal membranes was saturable, reversible and dependent upon protein concentration. Saturation studies revealed that [3H]CGS 21680 bound with high affinity (Kd = 15.5 nM) and limited capacity (apparent Bmax = 375 fmol/mg of protein) to a single class of recognition sites. Estimates of ligand affinity (16 nM) determined from association and dissociation kinetic experiments were in close agreement with the results from the saturation studies. [3H]CGS 21680 binding was greatest in striatal membranes with negligible specific binding obtained in rat cortical membranes. Adenosine agonists ligands competed for the binding of 5 nM [3H]CGS 21680 to striatal membranes with the following order of activity; CGS 21680 = 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine greater than 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV-1808) = 5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine = 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-phenylisopropyladenosine greater than N6-cyclohexyladenosine greater than N6cyclopentyltheophylline greater than S-phenylisopropyladenosine. The nonxanthine adenosine antagonist, CGS 15943A, was the most active compound in inhibiting the binding of [3H]CGS 21680. Other adenosine antagonists inhibited binding in the following order; xanthine amine congener = (1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chloro)phenylxanthine greater than 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine greater than 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine greater than 8-phenyltheophylline greater than 8-cyclopentyltheophylline = xanthine carboxylic acid congener greater than 8-parasulfophenyltheophylline greater than theophylline greater than caffeine. The pharmacological profile of both adenosine agonist and antagonist compounds to compete for the binding of [3H]CGS 21680 was consistent with a selective interaction at the high affinity adenosine A2 receptor. A high positive correlation (r = 0.98, P less than .01) was observed between the pharmacological profile of adenosine ligands to inhibit the binding of [3H]CGS 21680 and the selective binding of [3H]NECA (+50 nM CPA) to high affinity A2 receptors. However, some differences between these assays were found for compounds which have moderate affinity and nonselective actions at both the A1 and A2 adenosine receptor subtypes. Unlike data obtained with nonselective adenosine ligands, the present results indicate that [3H]CGS 21680 directly labels the high affinity A2 receptor in rat brain without the need to block binding activity at the A1 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The development of cholinergic systems in brain regions was evaluated biochemically in developing control rats and rats whose mothers received nicotine via continuous minipump infusion during gestational days 4 to 20. The cerebral cortex displayed a unique maturational pattern of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and high-affinity synaptosomal [3H]choline uptake capabilities, characterized by increases in the concentration of these components and a postnatal spike of neuronal activity as assessed with the uptake/ChAT ratio; the peak of activity coincided with the time at which neurogenesis declines and synaptogenesis rises. Evaluation of the same markers in midbrain + brainstem indicated rises in uptake which were relatively unselective, primarily reflecting tissue growth and no postnatal peak of uptake/ChAT; cerebellum likewise showed primarily tissue growth-related changes in ChAT rather than increases in its specific concentration. Prenatal exposure to nicotine had a marked adverse effect on developmental patterns of ChAT, uptake and uptake/ChAT only in cerebral cortex, the region previously shown to exhibit major abnormalities caused by this drug and other treatments with cholinomimetic effects. ChAT was unaffected in peripheral projections to the adrenal. Nicotine may thus selectively disrupt central nervous system development by stimulating nicotinic receptors which are present in fetal brain, prematurely eliciting the events ordinarily triggered postnatally by cholinergic projections.\r"

  ".W": "Intrastriatal administration of the hydroxylated metabolites of amphetamine, p-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) or p-hydroxy-norephedrine (p-OHNor), decreased local concentrations of dopamine and serotonin in a dose-dependent manner. Although both compounds reduced concentrations of the metabolites of dopamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations were elevated. After systemic treatment with p-OHA, striatal dopamine was also reduced. In contrast, only hypothalamic and hippocampal serotonin stores were altered significantly in rats treated with p-OHA systemically. Neither compound decreased the activities of tryptophan hydroxylase or tyrosine hydroxylase. Because p-OHA is metabolized to p-OHNor via dopamine beta-hydroxylase present in noradrenergic neurons, the direct effects of these compounds on dopaminergic and serotonergic variables can be observed in rats which receive intrastriatal drug treatment. p-OHA and p-OHNor were equally potent in decreasing dopamine concentrations. However, p-OHNor was more potent than p-OHA in decreasing serotonin concentrations. Both compounds more readily depleted dopamine compared to serotonin stores. Complete recovery of p-OHA-induced decreases in striatal dopamine occurred within 48 hr of intrastriatal administration and concurrent treatment with the dopamine uptake blocker, amfonelic acid, significantly attenuated the p-OHA-induced effects on dopamine.\r"

After washing for 90 min with Krebs' solution containing 10 microM cocaine and 1 microM yohimbine, 2-min effluents were collected for 96 min. The preparations were stimulated 4 times for 3 min, S1, S2, S3 and S4 (field stimulation: 2 Hz, 1 msec, 60 V), and the tritium content of the samples was measured by scintillation spectrometry. S1 served as a control and at S2-4 oxotremorine dose-response curves were taken expressing the dose-related inhibition of the evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine as percentage of the control. Atropine shifted the dose-response curve to the right in a parallel fashion but the antagonism was noncompetitive in as much as the equilibrium constant was smaller at lower concentrations than at higher one (2.3 and 5.8 nM, respectively). The tricyclic antidepressants also displaced the dose-response curve to the right in a parallel fashion but their inhibitory effects were two orders of magnitude lower and the maximal inhibitory effect was reached at around 5 microM also proving the noncompetitive nature of the antagonism. These results are in good correlation with isolated muscarinic receptor binding studies as well as with the cardiac side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants experienced in the course of clinical administration.\r"

They were tested for their effects on the transport of either a prototypic organic cation, N1-[3H]methylnicotinamide or a prototypic organic anion p-[3H]aminohippurate. They were classified as a substrate for either transport system if the following two criteria were fulfilled: 1) cis inhibition and 2) trans stimulation with concentrative uptake of the prototypic ion. Both gentamicin and verapamil cis inhibited the uptake of the prototypic organic cation N1[3H]methylnicotinamide, with Ki values of 450 and 5 microM, respectively. Similarly, both drugs trans-stimulated N1-methylnicotinamide influx and produced concentrative uptake over the equilibrium value. The results demonstrate that gentamicin and verapamil are substrates for the renal organic cation transport system. We postulate that high-affinity substrates should protect against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "The stereoselective formation of 4'-hydroxypropranolol sulfate (HOPS) from racemic 4'-hydroxypropranolol (HOP) has been investigated using canine hepatic cytosol and partially purified phenolsulfotransferases (PSTs). Pseudo first order rate constants, Vmax/Kmapp, were significantly greater (P less than .05) for the formation of R-HOPS by canine hepatic cytosol, S/R-HOPS = 0.72. Moreover, double reciprocal replots for the sulfation of both HOP enantiomers were biphasic, suggesting the presence of multiple PST enzymes. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) inhibited the sulfation of both HOP enantiomers with an IC50 of 244 nM, suggesting that phenol (P) forms of the PST enzymes may be primarily responsible for the cytosolic sulfation. Three distinct PST fractions were partially purified from the cytosol and were found to possess unique stereoselectivities toward HOP. Fraction 1 was most stereoselective, S/R-HOPS = 0.51, but was not inhibited by PCP, suggesting that it is a monoamine (M) form PST. Fraction 3 was the most active fraction and mimicked the cytosol in both stereoselectivity, S/R-HOPS = 0.73 vs. 0.72, and susceptibility to PCP inhibition, IC50 = 93 nM. The S/R-HOPS ratio produced by fraction 2 was 0.63. These data demonstrate the presence of multiple PST enzymes with differing stereoselectivities for the enantiomers of HOP in canine hepatic cytosol. Further studies with homogeneous PST isozymes, ideally from human tissue, and other chiral drugs are needed to define the enzymatic mechanism of this reaction and its role in chiral drug metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors are present in both central and peripheral neuronal tissues but radioligand binding studies have thus far been limited to crude membranes from brain and vagus nerve. The present studies describe the isolation and characterization from the rabbit small bowel of neuronal membranes enriched in binding sites for the potent 5-HT3 ligand, [3H]zacopride. The number of specific [3H]zacopride binding sites per milligram of protein was increased 6-fold in a 10,000 to 100,000 x g membrane fraction as compared to the homogenate. [3H]Zacopride bound to these membranes with high specificity (greater than 90%), exhibited high affinity for a homogeneous population of binding sites (Kd = 0.3 nM) and its binding was inhibited competitively by other 5-HT3 compounds with the following rank order of potency: ICS 205-930 greater than GR 38032F greater than or equal to quipazine greater than BRL 24924 approximately MDL 72222 much greater than metoclopramide greater than 2-CH3-5-HT3. On a discontinuous sucrose gradient, specific [3H]zacopride binding was increased an additional 3.5-fold and copurified with three plasma membrane markers. Fractionation on a continuous sucrose gradient demonstrated that specific [3H]zacopride binding was associated with the enteric neuronal plasma membranes. Comparative studies in rabbit vagus nerve also demonstrated a large number (maximum binding = 148 fmol/mg of protein) of high affinity [3H]zacopride binding sites (Kd = 0.4 nM), in membranes that exhibited a density and binding characteristics similar to those from enteric neurons. Thus, membranes enriched in 5-HT3 binding sites can be isolated from both enteric and vagus neurons and [3H]zacopride is a potent ligand useful for characterization of these sites.\r"

Provocative doses of KA (0.3, 1 and 3 ng/microliters.hr) were infused into the PVH to selectively stimulate neuronal cell bodies, but not fibers of passage. Unilateral PVH infusions of KA (1 ng/microliter.hr) produced excitatory behavior primarily consisting of occasional grooming and increased locomotor activity, and periodic increases in BP and HR. The mean slope of the baroreflex response (delta heart period/delta mean BP; phenylephrine infusion method) curves was decreased by 24% (P less than .01 vs. control) when measured 1 to 1.5 hr after initiation of PVH infusion. The extent of diffusion of [3H]KA (1 ng/microliter.hr) was examined 1 hr after PVH infusion. Radioactivity was detectable at levels above 3 x background 1.6, 2.0 and 3.5 mm, respectively, from the injection site in sagittal, coronal and horizontal planes, indicating fairly extensive distribution patterns. Paraventricular hypothalamic infusions of KA (3 ng/microliters.hr) produced more intense behavioral excitation with slightly greater increases in BP and HR as compared with 1 ng/microliter.hr infusions. Paraventricular hypothalamic infusions of KA (1 and 3 ng/microliters.hr) increased urine flow and urinary Na+ and K+ excretion without affecting urine osmolality, whereas infusions of KA (0.3 ng/microliters.hr) produced no alterations in behavior, BP, HR, renal hemodynamics or renal excretory function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After ad libitum smoking, seven subjects were deprived of nicotine for 10 days and then resumed smoking. During tobacco abstinence, there were significant decreases in alpha frequency and beta frequency and increases in theta power. These effects were observed as early as 29 hr and in some instances persisted for 7 days. In the second experiment, a group of eight heavy smokers chewed 12 pieces of either placebo or nicotine-containing polacrilex gum (2 or 4 mg) per day while deprived of cigarettes. In the placebo condition, electroencephalographic signs were similar to those accompanying tobacco deprivation in the first experiment. Administration of nicotine polacrilex prevented the appearance of these tobacco withdrawal signs. This study provides new information on the time course of certain electrophysiologic components of the tobacco withdrawal syndrome and confirms that the effects are specific to the deprivation of nicotine. The data also suggest that the 4-mg polacrilex was more effective than the 2-mg dose when the results across all measures were considered.\r"

  ".W": "The allosteric effects and subtype selectivity of methoctramine on neuronal muscarinic receptors in N1E-115 cells and two different rat brain regions (cerebral cortex and striatum) were assessed. Saturation isotherms of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding, performed in N1E-115 cells and dissociated cerebral cortex, showed that methoctramine reduced the Bmax in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, this compound slowed the rate of dissociation of bound [3H]N-methylscopolamine in the same tissue preparations. Low concentrations of methoctramine (less than or equal to 1 microM) antagonized the M1-linked phosphoinositide response in N1E-115 cells and dissociated cerebral cortex in an apparent competitive mechanism. However, methoctramine exhibited noncompetitive effects at higher concentrations in N1E-115 cells. Observation of a similar effect in cerebrocortical cells was precluded since methoctramine by itself, at concentrations higher than 1 microM, stimulated inositol phosphate formation. The stimulatory effect of methoctramine on phosphoinositide hydrolysis was not blocked by atropine. A solely competitive mode of antagonism by methoctramine was observed for the inhibition of cAMP formation (a noncardiac-M2 coupled response) in N1E-115 cells and dissociated striatum. This antagonism was evident even at concentrations of methoctramine that noncompetitively antagonized the M1 response. Anomalously, methoctramine alone inhibited cAMP formation in dissociated striatum at concentrations of greater than or equal to 30 microM. Atropine was ineffective at blocking this effect. Methoctramine failed to demonstrate muscarinic receptor subtype selectively in blocking these two second messenger responses. This nonselectivity was supported by indirect binding experiments involving methoctramine and [3H]N-methylscopolamine. The data presented here demonstrate that methoctramine binds to a secondary site(s) associated with neuronal muscarinic receptors. Furthermore, methoctramine exhibits different mechanisms of antagonism and displays poor selectivity for the M1-linked phosphoinositide and noncardiac-M2 linked cAMP responses.\r"

To determine if disease inactivation leads to their occurrence, we studied 38 patients with RA whose disease had gone into drug induced remission. We looked for osteophytes at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints in roentgenograms taken before and after remission, and correlated their presence to that of osteoarthritis of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. There were 21 patients with RA who had a median of 3 (range 1-8) osteophytes in their \"remission\" films which were rarely present in their \"activity\" films (p less than 0.0001). The osteophytes were frequently symmetrical and most often located (41%) at the third MCP joint. In addition, we observed a peculiar remodeling of the styloid process in 13 patients, 9 of whom had developed MCP joint osteophytes. There were no other detectable differences between patients who had MCP joint osteophytes and those who did not. Presence of osteoarthritis at the DIP joints did not correlate with development of osteophytes. We were able to classify the MCP osteophytes into 3 types on the basis of their shape: hook-like that were most frequently bilateral and situated on the radial aspect of the metacarpal side of the joint, beak-like that were most often found at the ulnar aspect of the phalangeal side, and nipple-like which occurred equally on either sites. These differences in distribution indicate that they are not stages of the same process. Our findings indicate that paraarticular bone remodeling occurs upon remission of RA, even in joints where osteoarthritis is unusual. Its shape and location may depend on both their site and the mechanism of joint damage.\r"

Production of interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin 2 (IL-2) and immunoglobulin (Ig) by blood and tonsillar mononuclear cells from rheumatic or healthy children was measured after stimulation in vitro by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or the streptococcal extracellular product, blastogen A (BLA). Tonsillar cells from patients with rheumatic heart disease produced significantly less IL-1, TNF, IL-2, and Ig than control tonsillar cells. In contrast, blood mononuclear cell cultures from rheumatic children produced more TNF and IL-2 than controls. Our findings suggest that abnormal regulation of cytokine and Ig production may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.\r"

Of these, most of whom were men, 376 (22%) had undergone DXT. An attempt was made to select a control for each. Because of the difference in ages at onset, 100 treatment recipients were matched with 100 controls (mean ages 44.5 years and 44.7 years, respectively). The mean Ankylosing Spondylitis Assessment Questionnaire disability score (range 0-8) was worse for the DXT group (5.5 vs 4.8 for controls: p less than 0.0001) and most components of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales showed a poorer outcome for those irradiated. Thus, 22% of nationwide AS sufferers had irradiation. This group could also have had more severe disease at the outset. At review, somewhat fewer of the irradiated group were taking NSAID. Although irradiation may have favorably affected the course of these patients our data do not support the use of irradiation except in exceptional cases.\r"

Mollicute-like organisms (MLO) were recently reported to be a common cause of chronic uveitis. MLO are pathogenic intracellular cell wall deficient bacteria. No culture system exists for MLO. Disease diagnosis is based on detection using a transmission electron microscope. Uveitis producing MLO are detectable within parasitized intraocular leukocytes. They appear as intracytoskeletal 0.005-0.01 micron diameter filaments and undulating pleomorphic 0.01-1.0 micron tubulospherical bodies. This report describes MLO parasitized lesional leukocytes in the inflammatory eye disease of 5 patients with JRA. Our results indicate that MLO caused the uveitis of these patients. The significance of these findings and rifampin treatment of MLO disease are discussed.\r"

In contrast, the keratan sulfate (KS) peptide levels present in sera of these animals were elevated relative to a saline treated control group. By injecting 25 mg hydrocortisone succinate combined with pentosan polysulfate (Cartrophen) (5 mg) into rabbit joints over the 8 week period, the loss of proteoglycans and HA from articular cartilage was abrogated and serum KS-peptides were restored, with time, to within control levels. These findings suggest that intraarticular administration of high dose hydrocortisone succinate to rabbits has a deleterious effect on articular cartilage HA and proteoglycan metabolism but this effect can be attenuated by co-intraarticular administration of Cartrophen.\r"

Users tended to be female, symptomatic, white, older, and better educated than the adult population. The most frequent category of need was emotional support, followed by referral, symptom/test explanation, treatment explanation, self-help method, medication, and physician-patient communication. Informational needs were significantly related to the gender, age, and the reported diagnoses of the user. Our results suggested that telephone services for health promotion may need to make special efforts to reach nonwhite and less educated persons and to provide emotional support.\r"

A markedly depressed immune clearance and splenic uptake of radiolabelled and IgG coated autologous erythrocytes was observed. The magnitude of this defect equaled or exceeded the most severe defects seen in a group of patients with SLE. This phenomenon was associated with markedly depressed serum C4 levels, a variably positive Sm antibody, and normal circulating immune complex concentrations. In addition, many clinical extrahepatic manifestations meeting criteria for classifying SLE were present. These findings further support the concept of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and SLE being part of spectrum of overlapping autoimmune diseases.\r"

The 17% reduction in average estradiol concentration was accompanied by an average reduction of 12 mg/dL in total plasma cholesterol (P less than .001), an average weight loss of 3.4 kg (P less than .001), and an average reduction in daily dietary fat from 68.5 to 29.5 g. Our review of case-control studies indicates that a 17% reduction in plasma estradiol may explain a noteworthy component of the international variation in breast cancer incidence.

This inhibition was dose dependent, was significant only at concentrations greater than 6 microM, and it required exposure to the drug for more than 1 hour. This period of IL-2 unresponsiveness was maximum at 6 hours, but was spontaneously recovered within 24-48 hours and was more rapidly restored by increasing dosages of IL-2. Because inhibition of the generation of LAK cells by CDDP was observed only at relatively high levels of exposure to the drug (greater than 6 microM for greater than 1 hr), it was important that we explore the in vivo significance of these findings. The peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients bearing ovarian adenocarcinoma collected 1 hour after an iv infusion of 50 mg of CDDP/m2 were not inhibited, compared with those collected immediately before therapy. Relatively high levels of exposure to CDDP are required for inhibition of the generation of new cytotoxic effectors, most likely because of its antiproliferative effect. These results may bear relevance to approaches involving the combined use of CDDP and IL-2-LAK.\r"

  ".W": "A phase II trial of intermittent high-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was initiated to evaluate the response rate, remission duration, and toxic effects in patients with measurable metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The rIL-2 was administered as a bolus intravenous infusion at a dose level of 10.0 x 10(6) U/m2 three times weekly, preceded by indomethacin (50 mg orally). Dose reductions of rIL-2 for hypotension and other grade 3 or 4 toxic effects were permitted. Forty-four patients were entered and 41 were eligible. Previous treatment included nephrectomy (23 patients), radiation therapy (seven), and hormone therapy (three). Most toxic effects observed were moderate and included nausea, vomiting, anorexia (85%); hypotension (85%); fever, chills (78%); central nervous system changes (24%); myelosuppression (27%); and creatinine elevation (15%). Four instances of grade 4 toxicity were observed and included nausea, vomiting with dehydration; hypotension; and myocardial infarction. Thirty patients (73%) required dose adjustments because of toxicity. Five responses (12%) were seen, which included one complete and four partial. Sites of response included lung, liver, and soft tissue; the duration of response ranged from 2 to 20+ months. These results demonstrate that this schedule of rIL-2 can be administered in an outpatient setting, and can produce tumor regression in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, including durable complete responses.\r"

Despite this incidence, the factors responsible for the production of injury remain poorly defined. Although extremes of pH seem to correlate well with the production of esophageal lesions, pH alone fails to explain the damage resulting from exposure to agents with near neutral pH, such as soldering flux containing zinc chloride. We determined titratable acid/alkaline reserve (TAR) in 38 potentially caustic household agents. A subset of these products was evaluated in an in-vitro canine esophageal model to determine whether TAR correlated with esophageal injury. The results indicate that for the products evaluated TAR correlated better than pH with the production of caustic esophageal injury.\r"

The following morning, esophagoscopy revealed tablet material identified as a granular paste at the level of the cricopharyngeus. A large amount of the paste was encountered at the crossing of the aorta where the mucosa was extremely erythematous and edematous. Smaller amounts of the paste were observed until a larger amount was found at the lower esophageal junction. The material was removed with NSS irrigation, suction, and optical peanut forceps. A significant circumferential burn was present. Repeat esophagoscopy 7 days postingestion showed mucosal edema and some scarring.

Acute lumbosacral plexopathy developed following renal transplantation in 4 female patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus between January 1, 1981 and June 30, 1988. In all 4 patients the internal iliac artery was used for revascularization of the renal allograft with ligation of the anterior and posterior divisions. Within 24 hours of surgery they complained of ipsilateral buttock pain, numbness in the leg and weakness below the knee. This complication has not been observed in nondiabetic patients at our institution, nor in diabetic patients when the internal iliac artery was not used. However, lumbosacral plexopathy occurred in 4 of 27 (14.8%) female patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus when the internal iliac artery was used (p less than 0.001). Age, duration of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking history and kidney donor were not significant predictors of this complication. This unusual and newly recognized complication appears to result from ischemia of the lumbosacral plexus following ligation of the internal iliac artery in patients with severe small vessel disease.\r"

Human papillomavirus type 6 messenger ribonucleic acid was demonstrated within biopsy specimens using tritium-labeled single-stranded antisense ribonucleic acid probes. Compared to condylomata the papillary transitional epithelium expressed less viral message, which might be expected in an epithelium that does not show full squamous epithelial or koilocytotic differentiation. Among these patients there was 1 papillary transitional lesion in the bladder that, although histologically similar, did not express human papillomavirus message, suggesting differential susceptibility of epithelium between the bladder and urethra. The finding of active human papillomavirus transcription within the urethral papillary transitional lesions raises the possibility of an active role for the virus in the pathogenesis of these lesions. These findings broaden the spectrum of epithelial types reported to support human papillomaviruses and provides impetus for a wider search for these viruses in other transitional cell neoplasms.\r"

We report 2 cases of nonischemic priapism, one of which occurred after blunt perineal trauma and the other after intracavernosal self-injection with papaverine and phentolamine. Based on our 2 cases as well as a review of the literature (5 cases), we propose that the pathophysiological mechanism of this disorder is unregulated arterial inflow into the corpora, classify it as arterial priapism, and describe a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for its management.\r"

Electrohydraulic lithotripsy successfully fragmented 91% of the calculi. All ureteral fragments cleared; in 2 patients with renal calculi solitary 4 mm. stone fragments remained. There were no intraoperative or long-term complications directly related to the use of electrohydraulic lithotripsy in the upper urinary tract.

For the in vivo test, the rabbit bladder was utilized and C-14 labeled urea 45-Ca, or 3H2O was placed into the lumen of control bladders, bladders pretreated with protamine sulfate (20 mg./cc) and bladders pretreated with protamine sulfate (20 mg./cc) plus pentosanpoly-sulfate (PPS), 10 mg./cc. After 45 minutes, the controls absorbed 21% of the urea, 16% of the calcium, and 38% of the 3H2O; the protamine treated group 40% urea, 23% calcium, and 51% H2O; the PPS only group 22% urea and the protamine plus PPS group absorbed 24% of urea, 18% calcium, and 44% water. Differences between the control and protamine groups were statistically significant, p less than 0.01 for urea 45-Ca and 3H2O. The bladder mucosa contained a significantly higher concentration of urea and calcium after protamine treatment which were both reversed by PPS (p less than 0.01) while 3H2O content went down significantly (p = 0.03), reflecting a loss of the hydrophilic effect of bladder GAG. The control mucosas had 250 cpm/mg. tissue urea for Ca 64 cpm/mg. and water 262 cpm/mg., the protamine group urea 498 cpm/mg., Ca 190 cpm/mg., and H2O 139 cpm/mg.; the protamine plus PPS group urea 344 cpm/mg., Ca 129 cpm/mg., and water 168 cpm/mg. For the in vitro studies, an Ussing chamber was employed. Normal rabbit bladder membranes were placed in the chambers and the potential difference was zeroed across the membrane. There were three groups, membranes that were treated only with the irrigating solution, membranes pretreated with protamine, and membranes pretreated with protamine plus PPS. At the end of 40 minutes, there was an approximately 1.2% movement of urea across the control membrane, a 3.5% movement across the protamine treated membrane (a significant increase p less than 0.001) and a 1.1% movement across the protamine plus PPS treated membrane. It would appear that the surface polysaccharide may play an important role as a bladder permeability barrier in modulating both charged and uncharged small molecule movement in that its ability to impair such movement can be inhibited by protamine and this protamine effect can be reversed by a treatment with an exogenous sulfated polysaccharide.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, nerve mediated functions in the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the female rabbit urethra were characterized. Based on light microscopic findings, the interest was focused on the proximal third of the organ. A microsurgical dissection technique was developed, allowing separation of the two muscle layers. The following studies were carried out: functional in vitro investigations including exogenous application of drugs and electrical field stimulation, investigations of the release of 3H-noradrenaline (NA), and autoradiography for visualization of muscarinic receptors. The results can be summarized as follows: the adrenergic nervous influence, which was mediated mainly via alpha 1-adrenoceptors, dominated the contractile response of the circular layer and contributed significantly to the contraction of the longitudinal layer. A previously described fast, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic response was found in the circular muscle layer. This response should probably be ascribed to striated muscle with a different innervation and/or structure than skeletal muscle in general. Muscarinic cholinoceptors were abundant in the outer parts of the urethral wall and decreased in density in luminal direction. A significant cholinergic contractile component was demonstrated in the longitudinal muscle. A non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve-mediated relaxant response was found in both layers, although more pronounced in the circular one. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide completely relaxed both circular and longitudinal preparations contracted by noradrenaline. A possible basis for an interaction between adrenergic and cholinergic nerve endings was demonstrated in the circular muscle layer. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors on the adrenergic nerve endings markedly reduced the release of 3H-NA. The present results support the findings in previous studies on circularly and longitudinally oriented full-thickness preparations of the female urethra and further underline the differences in structure, innervation and receptor functions between the different muscle layers of the urethral wall.\r"

Prostatic tissues were cut into one to two mm. pieces and incubated in tissue culture medium containing S35-methionine (100 microCi/ml.) at 37C under 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide for four hours. The incubated tissues were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and radiofluorography. Analysis of protein spots detected in the fluorograms by computer-assisted densitometry revealed temporal changes in the synthesis of individual proteins by the ventral prostate of castrated rats following androgen treatment. Changes in two groups of proteins were evaluated: castration-induced proteins and androgen-dependent proteins. The level of synthesis of three castration-induced proteins (spots G, H, and I) declined rapidly upon testosterone treatment and reached a non-detectable level for spots G and H and a low level of synthesis for spot I by three days following androgen treatment. Synthesis of androgen-dependent proteins (spots D, E, and F) was activated by testosterone treatment. However, the time interval required to activate the synthesis of these proteins is different. Synthesis of protein spot D (prostatic binding protein) was detected as soon as half hour after the treatment. Synthesis of spots E and F, on the other hand, was not activated until 24 and 48 hours after the treatment, respectively. These changes in patterns of protein synthesis represent the characteristics of cellular responses to testosterone stimulation by the regressed prostate.\r"

CK polypeptides 5, 7, 8, 15, 18 and 19 were identified in fresh normal and hyperplastic prostate. Expression of CK 15 has not been previously reported in human prostate. Analysis of central and peripheral zone tissues from human prostate did not reveal qualitative differences in CK expression between these areas. Epithelial cells harvested from fresh BPH tissue by percoll gradient centrifugation and propagated in vitro using selective culture techniques showed alterations in CK expression compared to intact human prostate. Specifically, CKs 6, 14, 16 and 17 were noted in cultured BPH epithelial cells but not fresh normal prostate or BPH tissue. Immunoblot analysis of the established prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCAP showed expression of CKs 8 and 18 but not CKs 5, 7 and 15 which were observed in benign prostate. These studies further characterize CK expression in benign and malignant human prostate and provide insights which may be useful in differentiating normal, hyperplastic and malignant epithelial cells in the human prostate gland.\r"

PEA was indicated by the increase of the intracorporeal pressure (ICP) upon electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerves. PEA was significantly decreased in both orchidectomized groups. However, when reduction in the blood pressure was considered, the difference in PEA between Group I and the orchidectomized group was no longer significant. Before the orchidectomy, plasma testosterone level of 22 adult male dogs varied widely from 105 to 6302 pg./ml. At one or three months after the orchidectomy in 11 dogs, it decreased to a level below 100 pg./ml. There was no significant change in the body weight in the post orchidectomy period. These findings indicate that the castration and/or the resulting low plasma testosterone level does not directly affect PEA through the peripheral neural and cavernosal mechanism.\r"

Prostate adenoma specimens were obtained from nine men with asymptomatic BPH undergoing cystoprostatectomy, 11 men with symptomatic BPH undergoing open prostatectomy, and 11 men with symptomatic BPH undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A quantitative symptoms score analysis and urinary flow rate determinations documented the absence of bladder outlet obstruction in men undergoing cystoprostatectomy and confirmed the presence of bladder outlet obstruction in men undergoing prostatectomy. The mean equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) and the mean densities of 125I-Heat (alpha 1 adrenergic) and 3H-NMS (MCh) binding sites were similar in tissue homogenates obtained from men with asymptomatic and symptomatic BPH. The mean Kd of 3H-Rauwolscine (3H-Ra) was significantly greater in the prostatectomy specimens obtained from men with symptomatic BPH compared to the specimens obtained from men with asymptomatic BPH (p less than 0.05). The density of 3H-Ra (alpha 2 adrenergic) binding sites was significantly greater in the prostate adenomas obtained from men with symptomatic BPH compared to the prostate adenomas obtained from men with asymptomatic BPH (p less than 0.05). The difference in alpha 2 adrenoceptor density was accounted for by an increased receptor density in the open prostatectomy specimens. There was no significant correlation between alpha 2 adrenergic, alpha 1 adrenergic, and MCh receptor densities and prostate weight or patient age. This study indicates that the development of infravesical obstruction in men with BPH is not related to upregulation or altered binding affinity of alpha 1 adrenergic or MCh receptor binding sites. The significance of the observed upregulation of alpha 2 adrenoreceptors in the prostate adenomas obtained from men undergoing open prostatectomy is unknown, and requires further investigation.\r"

Initial experience in the first 10 patients with bladder stones treated by electromagnetic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy monotherapy is reported. All stones disintegrated after 1 treatment, except in a patient with 2 bladder stones who required 2 sessions. Mean treatment duration was 53 minutes. Mean number of shock waves was 3,600 and electrical discharge averaged 20.2 kv. per shock wave. Minute fragmentation was obtained and uncomplicated evacuation occurred without the need for adjuvant procedures, even in the presence of prostatic hypertrophy (2 patients) or neurogenic bladder dysfunction (3).

A control group of two dogs had laminectomy only. Neurologic function was evaluated daily. Cystometrics were performed on each dog after constriction had been present for three months. Cortical evoked potentials (CEPs) were obtained on all dogs preoperatively, immediately following constriction and at monthly intervals for three months. Dogs were sacrificed at three months and the cauda equina and spinal cord were examined histopathologically. Cystometric tracings were noted to become a flat line with 75% compression of the cord. Less compression had minimal effect on the cystometric curves. The mean latency, determined by cortical evoked potentials, was noted to increase by 3.2%, 7.8%, and 17.2% immediately after 25%, 50% and 75% constriction, respectively. Histologic changes ranged from occasional enlargement of the axons on the periphery of the cauda equina with 25% constriction to severe loss of all axons and atrophic roots at the level of the constricting band with 75% constriction.\r"

We have recently observed increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor messenger RNA in neoplastic tissue relative to normal kidney tissue from patients with renal cell carcinoma. To determine if epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification was present in renal cell carcinoma, DNA was extracted from renal cell carcinoma cell lines and from normal kidney and renal cell carcinoma tissues derived from radical nephrectomy specimens from thirty patients. DNA was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. There was no epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification detected in the renal cell carcinoma samples studied, indicating the increased epidermal growth factor gene expression observed in renal cell carcinoma does not occur through gene amplification. Unlike other tumors with enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor gene expression, amplification of this gene does not appear to be a common feature of renal cell carcinoma.\r"

In the mucosal layer, the VIP-fibers ran attached to blood vessels and encircled the glandular cavities. Acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers were also observed in the mucosal and muscular layers. Electron-microscopic studies revealed that NPY- and TH-containing nerve terminals were in apposition to smooth muscle cells, and VIP-fibers terminated at blood vessels. These results suggest different modes of action of NPY-, TH- and VIP-containing nerve fibers in the seminal vesicle.\r"

Then, in a \"steady-state phase\", there is no further weight reduction in kidneys with either mild or severe obstruction.

Selection criteria and potential complications are discussed with regard to each technique. These procedures provide an excellent means for reconstruction of the urinary tract in patients who have failed other treatments.\r"

We describe 4 Lynch syndrome II kindreds in which carcinoma of the ureter, as well as other forms of urological cancer, have occurred either in obligate gene carriers and/or in association with multiple primary cancers that are integral to this autosomal dominantly inherited disorder. These new findings are in accord with increasing recognition of tumor heterogeneity in the Lynch syndrome II, which currently, in addition to an excess of proximal colonic cancer as well as carcinoma of the endometrium, ovary and small bowel, also may include carcinoma of the ureter as well as other urological forms of cancer as integral lesions in subsets of these families. These observations have important ramifications for better understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and control of urological cancer in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relationship of natural killer activity from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with clinical stage of disease and the different modalities of treatment in 67 untreated patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and 29 normal controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 39 patients with superficial bladder tumor (stages Ta and T1) showed a natural killer cell activity similar to that of controls (p greater than 0.05), while in 28 patients with infiltrating tumors (stages T2, T3 and T4) this activity was significantly depressed (p less than 0.01). This functional phenomenon cannot be ascribed to a deficient number of natural killer cells in patients with infiltrating tumors, since the amounts of HNK-1+ (Leu 7), CD16+ (Leu 11) and CD11b+ (OKM1) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were similar in the 3 groups of subjects (p greater than 0.05). Furthermore, the natural killer activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was normal (p greater than 0.05) in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the tumors and intracavitary cytostatic therapy with doxorubicin who remained free of disease at least 6 months after treatment. However, in patients with superficial recurrent tumor a significant decrease in the natural killer activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed (p less than 0.05), which was more pronounced in those with infiltrating recurrence. Also, in the latter patients total cystoprostatectomy was associated with a relevant increase in the spontaneous level of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We conclude that in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder there is a correlation of the levels of natural killer activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with clinical evolution and pathological stage of disease. The determination of this activity is useful to monitor patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

At operation the tumors in 10 patients (40%) were downstaged--3 of 5 from stage T2, 3 of 4 from stage T3a and 4 of 16 from stage T3b, while 6 patients (24%) had no residual tumor (pT0). The actuarial 5-year survival rate for all patients was 50%. Disease recurred in the pelvis in 7 patients, none of whose tumors had been downstaged (6 died of cancer). Median survival of patients with a pelvic recurrence was 9 months and without recurrence it was 86.7 months (p = 0.03). No patient whose tumor was downstaged had a recurrence or died of bladder cancer. We conclude that irradiation before cystectomy in patients with squamous cell bladder cancer may protect against pelvic recurrence, which is the predominant cause of death. Because effective adjuvant chemotherapy is not available to treat squamous cell carcinoma as it is for transitional cell carcinoma, we recommend irradiation before cystectomy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

  ".W": "Of 273 male patients who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy between 1967 and 1987, 22 were regarded as at risk for urethral recurrence. These patients underwent simultaneous primary urethrectomy or urethrectomy shortly after cystectomy because of the histology of the cystectomy specimen. Of the remaining 251 patients a urethral recurrence was observed in 23 (9.2%). A patient with a urethral recurrence originally had undergone an operation at another hospital. The first urethral tumor recurrence was observed in 1977 but between October 1987 and May 1988, 7 patients were treated for an initial or secondary urethral recurrence. This finding suggests that the rate of urethral recurrence increases with improved survival rates after cystoprostatectomy and longer followup of these patients. Of the 24 patients who had urethral recurrence 21 showed multifocal tumor growth in the primary cystectomy specimen and 2 had unifocal tumors. The original histological status in the patient treated elsewhere is not known. The data suggest that primary simultaneous urethrectomy should be performed in all patients undergoing cystoprostatectomy for multifocal bladder tumors. Patients who retain the urethra require regular and life-long washout cytology studies of the urethra for early diagnosis of recurrent urethral tumor.\r"

Erection, increase in circumference as well as rigidity, can be measured with a simple device consisting of a calibrated felt band with a sliding collar fastened to 1 end. Subjects were 58 consecutive patients, mainly from a urology outpatient department, with erection problems and 67 healthy control men. Changes in penile circumference were measured during viewing of an erotic videotape and during sleep. Functional sexual potency, at least partially, was presumed to exist in 41 patients (71%), many of whom had a somatic pathological condition that might easily have been believed to be the cause of the erectile dysfunction. During the latter half of the study nocturnal penile tumescence also was measured. This group included 7 patients who did not respond to the visual stimuli, 5 of whom had normal nocturnal penile tumescence. We conclude that the erection meter, in conjunction with an erotic video test and nocturnal penile tumescence measurements, is a useful and simple device in the differential diagnosis of erectile difficulties in men. This is true especially when elaborate sleep laboratory facilities and neurophysiological equipment are not available.\r"

One patient was excluded from the study for technical reasons. Of 14 patients who had a normal Snap-Gauge evaluation, defined by breakage of all 3 bands, 12 (86%) had a normal and 2 (14%) had an abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence evaluation. A total of 28 patients failed to break any of the Snap-Gauge bands and 7 broke only 1 or 2 bands. Of these 35 patients with an abnormal Snap-Gauge study 14 (40%) had a normal and 21 (60%) had an abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence evaluation. In a subsequent clinical evaluation 1 of the 2 patients with a normal Snap-Gauge study and an abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence test reported continued inadequate sexual function and, subsequently, he received a penile prosthesis. Of the 14 patients with an abnormal Snap-Gauge study and a normal nocturnal penile tumescence test 11 were located and 8 were sexually active with adequate erections for intercourse without further medical treatment other than counseling. We conclude that the correlation between Snap-Gauge and nocturnal penile tumescence is not good, and that the nocturnal penile tumescence test is more accurate to determine the clinical diagnosis.\r"

Since 1972 we used a transpubic approach to improve surgical exposure in 287 patients operated on for prostate, bladder or urethral cancer, post-traumatic strictures and other conditions. The type of pubectomy performed (total, partial superior or partial inferior) depended upon whether a suprapelvic or infrapelvic diaphragm organ was the primary target of the approach. Total pubectomy was used in 137 patients, partial superior bone resection in 140 and partial inferior resection in 10 patients. Technical details for each type of pubectomy are illustrated. The transpubic approach was particularly useful for repair of posterior urethral strictures or removal of bulky tumors. Among the 3 types of approaches used, total pubectomy was associated with a high complication rate including bleeding, pelvic instability, urinary incontinence and stricture of the vesicourethral anastomosis. Therefore, we have abandoned the technique since 1978. Partial pubectomy provides exposure comparable to that of total pubectomy but with minimal complications, making it an alternative to the standard approach in difficult cases.\r"

This finding contrasts with our previous experience with severe hemorrhagic cystitis, particularly the type due to a viral infection, persisting in the face of numerous bladder manipulations. We encourage the use of this nontoxic treatment to gain further information regarding its effect on the bladder epithelium. The mechanism of action remains completely unknown.\r"

  ".U": "90096280\r", 
  ".W": "The onlay island flap urethroplasty, a variant of the transverse preputial (tubularized) island flap, was originally described for repair of anterior hypospadias. However, many cases of mid and proximal hypospadias have a well developed urethral plate and exhibit little or no chordee after release of skin tethering. Patients with this combination of findings are ideal candidates for onlay island flap urethroplasty regardless of initial meatal position. During the last 5 years the onlay island flap has been used for repair of mid to posterior hypospadias in 31 patients (38% of the cases). These are variants that formerly would have required more extensive urethroplasty. Because of the technical advantages of the onlay island flap this alteration in technique selection has resulted in fewer complications. When applied to mid and posterior hypospadias the onlay island flap maintained a significantly lower complication rate (10%) compared to other standard techniques. Preservation of the urethral plate in hypospadias repair is a principle with significant implications to an extended variety of hypospadias.\r"

Because no national health program ensures entitlement to basic services, practitioners and patients must cope with barriers to access on the local level. We report several separate but integrated strategies that a community-based coalition has used to achieve improvements in indigent care within a single county. Research strategies have involved short-term investigations of barriers to needed services so that local awareness of the problem would increase rapidly. Political strategies have attempted to improve the county government's administrative procedures and financial support of services for the poor, to modify the practices of local health care institutions, and to influence state and national policies that affect local conditions. Legal strategies have involved the participation of attorneys who represent clients unable to receive care and who could initiate litigation as appropriate. Each of these strategies contains weaknesses as well as strengths. Although such advocacy efforts do not achieve a coherent system that guarantees access, they can substantially improve the availability of local services.\r"

  ".W": "Since serum cholesterol is a major component in the causal pathway of atherosclerosis, a pathological process that usually progresses with age, we have evaluated reported findings of a diminished association between serum cholesterol level and coronary heart disease in the elderly. In the Honolulu (Hawaii) Heart Program, 1480 men aged 65 years and older and free of coronary heart disease were followed up for an average of 12 years. Incidence rates of coronary heart disease increased progressively from the lowest to the highest quartile of serum cholesterol level. The independent role of serum cholesterol level as a predictor of coronary heart disease risk was evaluated with other major risk factors using a Cox multivariate regression model. The upper-lower quartile relative risk for serum cholesterol level was 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 2.36). The relative risk for middle-aged men was also 1.64. The results suggest that serum cholesterol level is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease, even among men older than 65 years. Thus, an elevated serum cholesterol level in the elderly should be regarded, as in middle-aged men, to be an indicator for further evaluation of lipoprotein levels and possible intervention.\r"

For patients in whom Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was among the first manifestations of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, the estimated 1-year survival increased from 42.7% for those diagnosed in 1984 and 1985 (95% confidence interval, 41.5% to 44.3%) to 54.5% for those diagnosed in 1986 and 1987 (95% confidence interval, 53.7% to 55.7%). The gain in survival was observed in homosexual men and intravenous drug users of both sexes, in all age and racial groups, in all geographic regions, and in patients with and without coexisting initial diagnosis. Reduced mortality in the 3-month period immediately following the initial diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome contributed little to the overall gain in survival. No gain in survival was seen for patients in whom P carinii pneumonia was not an initial manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is unlikely that the observed improvements in survival resulted solely from errors in death reporting. Better diagnosis and treatment, particularly the introduction of zidovudine in 1986, may have contributed to the decline in mortality.\r"

Patients were followed up prospectively through December 31, 1988. The median survival for all patients was 12.5 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 3.4%. Significantly improved survival was observed for patients diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in 1986 and 1987. Survival for patients diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma declined significantly between 1981 and 1987. Survival was unchanged among patients diagnosed with other opportunistic infections or malignancies. Proportional hazards analyses indicated that initial diagnosis, age, and year of diagnosis were significant predictors of survival. For a subset of patients (n = 644), therapy with zidovudine was an additional significant predictor of survival. This study suggests that survival following diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has improved in recent years, primarily among patients with carinii pneumonia. Therapy with zidovudine may be partially responsible for these recent improvements.\r"

Asymptomatic shedding from the vulva was as frequent as asymptomatic cervicovaginal shedding, and 45% of asymptomatic episodes were identified only by positive results from vulvar cultures. All women who obtained samples on more than 100 days and 80% of women who obtained samples on more than 50 days had documented asymptomatic viral shedding, compared with only 6% of those who obtained samples for fewer than 25 days. Asymptomatic shedding was not related to contraceptive use or menstrual cycle. These data suggest that all women with recurrent genital herpes simplex virus infection should be instructed about the possible risk, albeit infrequent, of asymptomatically shedding virus from the genital tract.\r"

More than two thirds (69.1%) of those abused reported that at least one of the episodes they experienced was of \"major importance and very upsetting.\" Half (49.6%) of the students indicated that the most serious episode of abuse affected them adversely for a month or more; 16.2% said that it would \"always affect them.\" Students identified various types of abuse and proposed a number of measures for the prevention and management of abuse in medical school. We conclude that medical student abuse was perceived by these students to be a significant cause of stress and should be a major concern of those involved with medical student education.\r"

Students were asked to rate the frequency and cite sources of mistreatment and misconduct among classmates, faculty, residents, and interns. They were also asked to assess the effects of such episodes on their physical health, emotional well-being, social and family life, and attitudes toward becoming a physician. The results indicate that students perceive mistreatment (particularly verbal abuse and unfair tactics) to be pervasive and professional misconduct all too common. As many as three fourths of the students report having become more cynical about academic life and the medical profession as a result of these episodes. Two thirds feel they are worse off than their peers in other professions. More than a third have considered dropping out of medical school and one fourth report they would have chosen a different profession had they known in advance about the extent of mistreatment they would experience. Rather than dismiss these problems as isolated events, we need to examine this issue more closely.\r"

To evaluate the effectiveness of consultative geriatric assessment and limited follow-up for ambulatory patients, we randomized 600 elderly patients who were enrolled in a health maintenance organization into three groups: (1) consultation by a geriatric assessment team, (2) consultation by a \"second opinion\" internist, and (3) only traditional health maintenance organization services (control patients). The geriatric assessment team identified previously unrecognized problems in 35% of patients and advised changes in medication regimens for more than 40%. Nevertheless, patients who received assessment achieved only a small benefit in cognitive function after 3 months, which was not sustained for 1 year. There was no difference among groups in other measures of health status. Consultative geriatric assessment with limited follow-up did not benefit most older ambulatory patients in a health maintenance organization; if such care can be used effectively for ambulatory patients, it will require either additional targeting or continuing care or both.\r"

Women who had always had regular cycles had higher lumbar densities (1.27 g/cm2) than those with a history of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea interspersed with regular periods (1.18 g/cm2). The lumbar density of both groups exceeded that of women who had never had regular cycles (1.05 g/cm2). Body weight became more important as a predictor variable as the severity of menstrual irregularities increased. The combination of menstrual pattern and body weight predicted 43% of the total variation in lumbar density. These data suggest that extended periods of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea may have a residual effect on lumbar bone density.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of physicians' work patterns and income between 1982 and 1987 provides strong evidence that the demand for physicians' services has risen at least as quickly as physician supply. Aggregate hours spent by US physicians who provide patient care rose by 21%, and aggregate real net income rose by more than 30% during a period in which the supply of physicians grew by only 16%. The aggregate number of visits rose by only 9%, indicating that the time spent per patient encounter rose sharply, presumably as a result of technological change and the increased complexity of care. Recently released data for 1988 are consistent with these trends. Our findings are inconsistent with the prediction by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee that there would be a large physician surplus by the year 1990. Moreover, if the upward trend in demand for physicians' services continues, as seems probable, a physician surplus should not develop in the foreseeable future. Only extensive rationing of beneficial services would be expected to alter this projection.\r"

Fetal tissue has intrinsic properties--ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, growth and proliferative ability, growth factor production, and reduced antigenicity--that make it attractive for transplantation research. At this time the results from fetal tissue grafts for Parkinson's disease and diabetes have not demonstrated significant long-term clinical benefit to patients with these disorders. Further research will be necessary to determine the potential value of fetal tissue transplantation. For these clinical investigations to proceed, specific ethical guidelines are needed to ensure that fetal tissue derived from elective abortions is used in a morally acceptable manner. These guidelines should separate, to the greatest extent possible, the decision by a woman to have an abortion from her consent to donate the postmortem tissue for transplantation purposes. Such ethical guidelines are offered in this report.\r"

Renal excretion of active kallikrein (microgram/day) was 128 +/- 9, 174 +/- 11 and 228 +/- 14 in 9%, 25%, and 50% protein-fed rats, respectively (P less than 0.02 or less between groups). Prokallikrein excretion in these groups was 23 +/- 7, 77 +/- 11 and 118 +/- 15 micrograms/day, respectively (P less than 0.005 or less between groups). The in vivo renal kallikrein synthesis rate, relative to total protein synthesis, was reduced in 9% protein-fed rats (2.74 +/- 0.24) compared to rats fed 25% (3.93 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.02) or 50% protein (4.41 +/- 0.30, P less than 0.001). These changes in synthesis and excretion rates were not accompanied by changes in renal tissue levels of active or prokallikrein. In all groups, GFR and RPF correlated directly with the renal excretion of active kallikrein, prokallikrein or total kallikrein (r = 0.41 to 0.66, P less than 0.01). Treatment of 50% protein-fed rats with aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor, markedly lowered renal and urinary kallikrein-like esterase activity.

  ".W": "There is evidence suggesting that glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are potent inhibitors of growth and aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals in vitro. This finding raises the possibility that the urinary GAG could play an inhibitory role in the urolithiasis. To investigate this hypothesis, a study on the urinary excretion of GAG in normal and stone forming adults and children was undertaken. Different methods were compared, and the best results were obtained when the GAG were measured by densitometry after agarose gel electrophoresis. Although the GAG concentration was increased in the morning urine compared to the 24-hour urine samples, and in males compared to females, the GAG/creatinine ratio was independent of period of urine collection and of sex. So, it was advantageous to express the amounts of urinary GAG as mg/g of creatinine. Children excreted more GAG than adults, with a higher proportion of chondroitin sulfate. We have shown that the stone forming subjects, both adults and children, excreted lower levels of urinary GAG as compared to normal subjects, independently of the metabolic disorder. The proportions between chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate and the structures of these GAG were unaltered in the stone formers. These results indicate that there is a definite difference in terms of levels of GAG between normal and stone forming urines, and suggest a correlation between the urinary GAG concentration and urolithiasis.\r"

To date, various endogenous mediators (histamine, bradykinin, activated complement factors, prostanoids) have been implicated in the mediation of peritoneal inflammation and increased peritoneal permeability. In the present study, a lipid compound with physicochemical and biological characteristics similar to platelet activating factor (PAF) (1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine) was extracted in significant amounts from the dialysate of eight out of nine peritonitis episodes in seven CAPD patients (Group A; 6771.4 +/- 3025.9 pM, mean +/- SEM at the first exchange during peritonitis). The amounts of PAF recovered in the first exchange dialysate from patients of Group A were linearly correlated with the loss of albumin (y = -3157.64 + 91.4x; r = 0.7394; N = 9; P less than 0.03) and number of leukocytes (y = 902.45 + 1.52x; r = 0.7576 N = 9; P less than 0.02). PAF was not detectable in the dialysate fluid from patients of Group A after recovery. Twelve patients on CAPD who had no past or present history of peritonitis (Group B) were used as controls; no PAF (9 patients) or only minimal amounts (3 patients: 7.0 pM; 23.0 pM; 70.0 pM) of this mediator were detected. This is the first direct demonstration of the local generation of PAF in a septic inflammatory reaction involving the peritoneal serosa in man. PAF produced by various cell types (neutrophils, peritoneal macrophages, endothelial cells) during peritoneal inflammation may contribute to the increased permeability of the peritoneal vascular bed.\r"

  ".W": "A single nephron model of nephrotoxic tubular injury was established to examine the mechanism whereby acute tubular damage contributes to reductions in nephron filtration rate (SNGFR). Acute microperfusion of 0.5 ng of uranyl nitrate (UN) into the early proximal tubule produced a significant reduction (16 to 30%) in SNGFR measured in both distal and proximal tubules of the same nephron and a decrease in absolute proximal reabsorption. Microperfused inulin was retained in the tubule suggesting this finding reflected a true reduction in SNGFR. Concurrent infusion of high dose furosemide (2 x 10(-4)M) and bumetanide (2 x 10(-5) M), but not low dose furosemide (2 x 10(-5) M), prevented the UN induced reduction in SNGFR. High dose furosemide begun after UN perfusion also prevented reduction in SNGFR. Continuous direct measurement of glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure revealed no change. Distal intratubular Na+ and Cl- concentration increased significantly after UN perfusion. Activation of tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms best explains the reduction in glomerular ultrafiltration that is characteristic of nephrotoxic forms of tubular injury.\r"

Single nephrons in the rat kidney were blocked with wax by micropuncture. After one day, one week, or one month of obstruction, the kidneys were fixed with glutaraldehyde by intravascular perfusion, and nephron structure was examined by light and electron microscopy. Following obstruction, glomerular changes developed more slowly than tubular changes. After one day, the only change noted in some glomeruli was the presence of inflammatory cells. The only tubule change upstream to the block was a focal loss of apical microvilli. This is in contrast to the severe damage previously reported (Evan, Tanner: Kidney Int 30: 818-827, 1986) in downstream proximal tubule segments at this time. After one month of obstruction, glomerular size was decreased and the glomerular filtration membrane was abnormal. Tubular cell size was decreased, apical microvilli were lost, basolateral interdigitations were reduced, and mitochondria were fewer and abnormally oriented. Interstitial fibrosis was present. Changes in nephron structure develop slowly after obstruction, perhaps because continued filtration and reabsorption maintain nephron integrity. Eventually, blocked nephrons atrophy, probably because of reduced blood flow, disuse, and inflammatory responses.\r"

Pretreatment with one dose of 50 mg of deferoxamine (DFO) shortened animal survival from 4.2 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.5 days for Rh. rhizopodiformis and from 8.8 +/- 0.4 to 7.3 +/- 1.9 days for Rh. oryzae (P less than 0.05). Survival was shortened even more after 4 doses of DFO (P = 0.0013 for Rh. rhizopodiformis and P = 0.002 for Rh. oryzae). After Rh. oryzae infection, animal survival decreased similarly after DFO, feroxamine or DFO combined with Fe3+ citrate (P less than 0.001). Fe3+ citrate also decreased survival (P = 0.0011), although significantly less than DFO either alone or combined with Fe3+. In vitro growth of both fungal strains was enhanced by addition of either DFO or Fe3+ at 0.001 to 1 mmol in the medium. DFO abolished the prolonged survival induced by amphotericin B in vivo and in vitro. Indeed, four doses of DFO abolished the improved survival due to amphotericin B (P = 0.0019 for Rh. rhizopodiformis and P = 0.002 for Rh. oryzae); DFO combined with Fe3+ at greater than or equal to 0.1 mmol decreased the antifungal activity of amphotericin B in vitro. These results point to a major role of DFO in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis in dialysis patients and suggest that DFO behaves as a siderophore for Rhizopus strains, stimulating their growth.\r"

Both in protocols A and in B, four basal renal clearances were performed before CsA and every twenty minutes for four hours after CsA administration.

A slight (not significant) hypertension occurred while renal resistances were markedly raised (P less than 0.001). Fractional urine and Na+ excretion as well as CH2O decreased, while UOsm increased (P less than 0.01). In protocol B, dopamine was infused from 120 to 180 minutes after CsA (that is, when the maximal adverse effects of CsA on renal hemodynamics had been observed in A). Dopamine infusion could reverse completely the effects of CsA on RPF, GFR, fractional urine output and CH2O; only UOsm remained higher than normal in conclusion with an increased fractional excretion of sodium (P less than 0.01). No changes were observed in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion both in protocols.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of intravenous calcitriol on parathyroid function was evaluated in nine chronic hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Two micrograms of calcitriol were administered intravenously after dialysis thrice weekly for ten weeks. Parathyroid function was assessed by inducing hypo- and hypercalcemia with low calcium (1.0 mEq/liter) and high calcium (4.0 mEq/liter) dialyses before and after ten weeks of intravenous calcitriol therapy. To avoid hypercalcemia during calcitriol administration, the dialysate calcium was reduced to 2.5 mEq/liter. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) values (pg/ml) from dialysis-induced hypo- and hypercalcemia were plotted against serum ionized calcium, and the sigmoidal relationship between PTH and calcium was evaluated. Basal PTH levels fell from 902 +/- 126 pg/ml to 466 +/- 152 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) after therapy without a significant change in the serum total calcium concentration. The ionized calcium-PTH sigmoidal curve shifted to the left and downward after calcitriol therapy. The maximal PTH response during hypocalcemia decreased after calcitriol from 1661 +/- 485 pg/ml before calcitriol to 1031 +/- 280 pg/ml afterward (P less than 0.05). The PTH level at maximal inhibition due to hypercalcemia decreased from 281 +/- 76 pg/ml before calcitriol to 192 +/- 48 pg/ml afterward (P less than 0.05). The slope of the sigmoidal curve changed from -2125 +/- 487 to -1563 +/- 385 (P less than 0.05). The set point of ionized calcium (4.60 +/- .11 mg/dl before vs. 4.44 +/- .07 mg/dl after) did not change significantly with calcitriol therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

According to the level of bone formation rate (BFR) on a prestudy bone biopsy, patients were split in two subgroups. Inside these two subgroups patients were randomly allocated to two therapeutics groups: 10 patients (group A) were dialyzed with the conventional amount of bicarbonate (33 +/- 2 mmol/liter) in the dialysate; the rest of the patients (group B, N = 11) had 7 to 15 mmol/liter sodium bicarbonate added to the dialysate to obtain 24 mEq predialysis bicarbonate plasma levels. An effective correction of acidosis was shown in group B by a higher predialysis plasma bicarbonate level (15.6 +/- 1 group A vs. 24.0 +/- 0.6 mEq/liter group B, P less than 0.005), which was reached three months after start of the study. Compared to the prestudy bone biopsy, osteoid and osteoblastic surfaces increased in group A but not in group B on the bone biopsies performed at the end of the study. Parathormone plasma level (iPTH), measured with an antiserum which cross reacts with the 44-68 region of PTH molecule, increased during the study in group A but not in group B. This finding suggested progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) only in group A patients. Osteocalcin plasma values increased in both groups during the 18 months of the study. Consequently the two subgroups of patients formed on the basis of BFR level were evaluated separately.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast to 13 sex- and age-matched controls, spontaneous platelet aggregation only occurred in patients with nephrotic syndrome with correlation to serum albumin and plasma fibrinogen levels. The EC50 (estimated concentration of aggregating agent to cause half maximum velocity of primary aggregation) for ADP and collagen and threshold concentration of arachidonic acid (threshold AA) were decreased in patients with nephrotic syndrome, reflecting a hyperaggregable state. In patients with nephrotic syndrome EC50 ADP values were significantly correlated to serum albumin, serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen, however, EC50 collagen or threshold AA did not correlate to these parameters. Plasma beta-TG levels were increased in patients, whereas plasma PF 4 levels were not significantly changed in patients compared to controls. In vitro TxB2 formation was elevated in patients only after stimulation with AA. Nevertheless, after stimulation with collagen and ADP, TxB2 formation was unchanged in patients compared to controls. Platelet hyperaggregability in nephrotic patients was confirmed in our study. However, unchanged thromboxane B2 formation after collagen stimulus as well as missing correlations between EC50 collagen or threshold AA and serum albumin were contradictory to the hypothesis that enhanced AA availability due to hypoalbuminemia is responsible for platelet hyperaggregability. Platelet hyperaggregability in terms of EC50 ADP being associated with serum albumin levels as well as to serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen indicate a multifactorial genesis.\r"

Concentrations of DFO and its chelated product, feroxamine (Fx), were assessed following single-dose DFO administration in twelve patients, and during chronic therapy over one year's time in eight, similarly iron-overloaded dialysis patients. A functional assay which relies on measurements of iron and iron binding capacity for the determination of Fx and DFO, respectively, was corroborated with liquid chromatographic techniques. Half-life measurements were also corroborated with tracer doses of 14C-DFO and 59Fe-feroxamine. Intradialytic DFO half-life (2.3 +/- 1.1 h) was considerably less than interdialytic half-life (26 +/- 1 hr). Unbound DFO was found to persist throughout the interdialytic period. Calculation of the percent saturation of the DFO dose indicated that only 30% of a given dose is chelated. The amount of iron removed dialytically was approximately 13.1 +/- 2.7 mg per dialysis session. Chronic DFO administration was also shown to enhance gastrointestinal iron excretion threefold. However, ferritin levels decreased by only 25% after one year of thrice-weekly DFO therapy. We conclude that DFO therapy for iron-overloaded hemodialysis patients is optimized by its administration interdialytically, and results in slow removal of iron, via both dialytic and gastrointestinal routes.\r"

Of the 170 patients, 108 had focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis alone (FSNGN), 33 had FSNGN and small-artery vasculitis, and 29 had FSNGN and medium-sized artery vasculitis. Considerable overlap of clinical, laboratory, and pathologic findings existed among the three groups. Overall patient survival was 81% at one year, 61% at five years, and 44% at ten years, significantly less than expected survival. Overall survival free of renal failure, by definition, was lower than patient survival. There were no differences among these three groups in patient survival or survival free of renal failure. Multivariate analysis identified leukocytosis and serum creatinine level as independent predictors of patient survival and survival free of renal failure. In addition, univariate analysis identified age and hypertension as significant risk factors but did not add independent predictive value for these two end points. In patients with serum creatinine levels less than 4 mg/dl, the effect of increasing levels of leukocyte count was significantly associated with poorer outcomes for both patient survival (P = 0.006) and survival free of renal failure (P = 0.024). Outcomes for these two end points were worse for patients with lower serum creatinine levels (less than 4.0 mg/dl) and high leukocyte counts (greater than 16,000/mm3) than for those with serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl.\r"

However, there is no data assessing the effects of RA on renal cells. Since the bulk of the compensatory kidney growth is due to tubular cells, we studied the effects of RA, retinol and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on a rabbit kidney epithelial cell line RK13 in culture. RA significantly increased thymidine incorporation by 42 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01). This increase appeared as soon as three hours after adding RA and could still be observed after five days. Total protein content was also increased by RA by 37 +/- 4% (P less than 0.01). Flow cytometer analysis showed a significant decrease in the percentage of resting cells (G0-G1 phases) induced by RA (-9.4 +/- 2%; P less than 0.01). We observed similar results in growth factor free medium, and the RA induced changes were the same in confluent and non-confluent cells. Retinol did not modify thymidine incorporation or total protein content. EGF increased by 75% thymidine incorporation (P less than 0.01). In serum free conditions RA failed to have a synergistic effect with EGF. These data show that RA is able to induce modifications in kidney epithelial cells compatible with those observed in hypertrophy while retinol is not. These modifications are not due to other growth factor potentiation but to RA itself, and are independent of the contact-inhibition phenomenon.\r"

Four weeks were allowed for remnant kidney hypertrophy before determining the response to renal ablation of individual animals regarding proteinuria and hypertension. At this time, five groups of 18 rats were formed with equal levels of proteinuria and hypertension. Groups E1 and E2 were treated with enalapril, groups V1 and V2 with verapamil, and one group served as control. The daily food allowance was 14 g/rat of a standard rat diet, containing 30% protein and 100 mmol NaCl/kg food in groups E1 and V1. NaCl content was reduced to 20 mmol/kg food in groups E2, V2 and control. The drugs were added to the drinking water, enalapril at a dose of 0.1 g/liter, verapamil at 0.5 to 0.7 g/liter. Drug intake thus amounted to 10 to 25 mg/kg for enalapril and 50 to 140 mg/kg for verapamil. Treatment was continued for 15 weeks. Three of the 18 control rats did not survive up to 15 weeks. Mortality was lower in the enalapril treated groups with a single nonsurvivor in group E1. In contrast, mortality was higher in the verapamil treated animals with seven nonsurvivors in group V1 and eight in group V2. Blood pressure control was excellent in both enalapril treated groups. and proteinuria decreased in most animals of group E1 and all of group 22. Glomerulosclerosis did not develop in the majority of the enalapril treated animals. Despite the high dose, verapamil barely lowered blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and experimental studies have shown that citrate markedly enhances the intestinal absorption of aluminum (Al), but the site and mechanism of enhanced absorption are unknown. To determine where in the gastrointestinal tract aluminum citrate (Alcitr) was absorbed. Alcitr was gavaged with D-[1-3H] glucose in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Plasma Al levels increased rapidly and simultaneously peaked with D-[1-3G] glucose, suggesting early proximal bowel absorption. In in vitro duodenal and jejunal everted gut preparations, Alcitr incubation resulted in increased tissue Al levels and markedly enhanced transmural transport of Al and citr. Unlike citr, the transmural movement of Al was independent of temperature (37 degrees C vs. 4 degrees C). On the other hand, Al lactate (al Lac) increased tissue associated Al levels but had no effect on transmural Al movement. To determine if this large flux of Al following Alcitr administration was due to paracellular movement, ruthenium red and Ussing chamber studies were used to evaluate the morphologic and functional integrity of cellular tight junctions. Alcitr, as opposed to AlCl3, markedly increased ruthenium red deposits in intercellular spaces, especially around goblet cells, and induced a prolonged significant reduction in transmural resistance. Alcitr also resulted in rapid and nearly complete (99.7%) chelation of free calcium, an event known to disrupt cellular tight junction integrity. Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced Al absorption following administration of Alcitr occurs in the proximal bowel via the paracellular pathway due to the opening of cellular tight junctions.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) regulates glomerular filtration rate by contracting mesangial cells and thereby decreasing glomerular filtration surface area. To elucidate the cellular mechanism of this action, we investigated the roles of Ca and protein kinase C (PKC) activation in Ang II-induced glomerular capillary vasoconstriction using 3H-inulin to measure the extracellular (largely intracapillary) volume of isolated decapsulated rat glomeruli. Ang II (1 microM) rapidly decreased the glomerular inulin space (GIS), bringing about a maximal decrease at five minutes, which lasted up to 30 minutes. When incubated in 0.5 mM EGTA-containing Ca-free medium or in the presence of 1 microM diltiazem or verapamil, the sustained phase (after 7 min) was completely inhibited. The initial effect (at 3 and 5 min) was only partially inhibited by these maneuvers but was completely inhibited by trifluoperazine or W-7, which indicated that it was dependent on calmodulin and, accordingly, on Ca probably released from the intracellular store. The sustained effect was mimicked by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the presence of extracellular Ca, but was not in its absence. The sustained effect was also inhibited by H-7, an inhibitor of PKC, and by W-7, which indicated that PKC activation and influx of extracellular Ca are both important. Combined treatment with A23187 and TPA could mimic both the initial and sustained effect of Ang II in the presence of extracellular Ca, though either one of them failed to do so when used alone. These results suggest that the initial effect of Ang II on GIS is mediated by Ca released from the intracellular store, on the one hand, and the sustained effect by extracellular Ca influx and PKC activation, on the other.\r"

  ".W": "The glomerular synthesis of LTB4 was assessed in glomeruli isolated from rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN was induced by a single intravenous administration of proteinuric doses of immune sera raised in sheep against rat brush border tubular fraction Fx1A. At various time points following induction of the disease glomeruli were isolated and LTB4 synthesis was assessed under basal and phospholipase A2 activation conditions. LTB4 was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay and was identified by UV spectroscopy. The role of complement system in mediating glomerular LTB4 synthesis was also assessed in a group of decomplemented rats using cobra venom factor and at various time points following administration of immune serum. Following induction of PHN, enhanced glomerular LTB4 synthesis was observed as early as one hour, peaked at five hours and returned toward control levels over the subsequent four days. The peak in glomerular LTB4 synthesis did not correlate with changes in glomerular neutrophiles or macrophages. A second increment of LTB4 synthesis occurred at the onset of heavy proteinuria (day 5). Complement depletion reduced proteinuria and the enhancement in LTB4 synthesis at day 5 but had no effect at earlier time points. The observations indicate that in non-inflammatory forms of glomerular immune injury the glomerular arachidonate 5-lipoxygenation is enhanced. This phenomenon has no apparent relationship with increased glomerular permeability to protein and may reflect the presence or activation of a leukotriene producing cell following intraglomerular interactions of Fx1A antigen, anti-Fx1A antibody and complement.\r"

We have identified preoperative factors that adversely affect the results. These include scleroderma; previous operation, either esophageal or gastric, and the severity of the esophageal stricture. Results of nonresectional operations are excellent in uncomplicated cases or with the addition of only one complicating factor. The more complicating factors, the worse the results. Those patients with three preoperative complicating factors do poorly and may benefit from esophageal resection. We conclude that results obtained from this conservative nonresectional management program justify continuance of the use of total fundoplication gastroplasty with preoperative and postoperative dilatation in the management of such patients.\r"

  ".U": "90097129\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine the early influence of platelet inhibition on the histologic, morphometric, and biochemical evolution of vein bypass grafts in a nonhuman primate model. Cephalic vein grafts were interposed bilaterally in the femoral arteries of 15 stump-tailed macaque monkeys fed a diet that sustains plasma cholesterol levels of approximately 225 mg/dl. All animals received in combination aspirin, 80 mg/day, and dipyridamole, 50 mg/day. Grafts were excised from five animals for analysis on each of postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90. In animals subjected to platelet inhibition, cholesterol content in the graft was 170 +/- 52 micrograms/100 mg at 90 days, 205% of the level in ungrafted vein (p less than 0.01). This change was small in comparison with the increase to 686% of ungrafted vein observed in our study of control animals. In stepwise regression analysis, cholesterol content of grafts was best predicted by prevalence of foam cells (r2 = 0.82), and the proportion of intima as a fraction of total wall area was best predicted by the presence of macrophages (r2 = 0.69). Platelet inhibition did not decrease the extent of intimal hyperplasia. The prevalence of adherent platelets (r = -0.72) and the amount of fibrin (r = -0.78) correlated inversely with the amount of endothelium present during the first 14 days. The strength of these correlations declined with time, despite persistent lack of endothelium in some areas. Medial fibrosis occurred to the same extent as in control grafts, as did the early appearance of platelet factor VIII and fibronectin and the lack of vasa vasorum at 3 days followed by reappearance at 7 days. These data demonstrate that platelet inhibition dramatically reduces lipid uptake by grafts in the first 90 days but has less influence over histologic or morphometric changes.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients were entered in a clinical trial on aortic valve replacement with a stentless glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine aortic valve. This bioprosthesis is secured to the aortic root by the same technique used for aortic valve replacement with aortic valve homografts. The functional results obtained from this operation have been most satisfactory. To assess the hemodynamic benefit of eliminating the stent of a porcine aortic valve, we matched 22 patients with a stentless porcine bioprosthesis for age, sex, body surface area, valve lesion, and bioprosthesis size to 22 patients who had aortic valve replacement with a Hancock II bioprosthesis. Mean and peak systolic gradients across the aortic bioprosthesis and effective aortic valve areas were obtained by Doppler studies. Gradients across the stentless bioprosthesis were significantly lower than gradients across the Hancock II valve for every bioprosthesis size. Effective aortic valve areas of the stentless bioprosthesis were significantly larger than the valve areas of the Hancock II valve. Our data demonstrate that the hemodynamic characteristics of a glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine aortic bioprosthesis are greatly improved when the aortic root is used as a stent for the valve. This technique of implantation is expected to enhance the durability of the bioprosthesis, because the aortic root may dampen the mechanical stress to which the leaflets are subjected during the cardiac cycle.\r"

  ".U": "90097131\r", 
  ".W": "Reports indicate that cryopreserved aortic valve allografts have a better long-term survivability than other bioprostheses, such as the porcine xenograft. Unlike xenografts, allograft valves do not require treatment with glutaraldehyde and may therefore retain much of their original mechanical function. The effects of cryopreservation on the mechanical integrity of collagen fibers and mucopolysaccharides, however, are still largely unknown. We therefore compared the mechanical behavior of cryopreserved allograft leaflet material to that of fresh tissue and xenografts by measuring their bending stiffness (nine strips of tissue) and their uniaxial tensile stress/strain and stress/relaxation behavior (six strips of each tissue type). The bending tests showed no significant difference between the pliability of cryopreserved allografts and fresh pig aortic valve tissue, but the xenograft material was significantly stiffer than both (p less than 0.001). The mean circumferential tensile elastic moduli of the allografts, fresh tissue, and xenografts at a stress of 300 kPa were 9.1 +/- 5.4 MPa, 13.0 +/- 1.7 MPa, and 12.5 +/- 3.0 MPa, respectively, and were not significantly different from each other. We also found that the transition from a low to a high modulus on the stress/strain curves, a measure of extensibility, occurs at 23%, 22%, and 12% strain for the three materials. There was no significant difference between the allograft and the fresh tissues, but the xenograft material was less extensible than the other two (p less than 0.001). The xenograft tissue also had significantly lower rates of stress relaxation than the other two materials (p less than 0.005). Thus no detectable differences were found between the mechanical behavior of the cryopreserved allograft aortic leaflets and fresh tissue, whereas the xenograft material was less extensible and less capable of relaxing than both the allograft and fresh tissue. The ability of allografts valves to respond to tensile and flexural stresses in a manner similar to that of the natural aortic valve may therefore contribute to their good in vivo survivability.\r"

  ".U": "90097132\r", 
  ".W": "From Jan. 1, 1961, through Dec. 31, 1987, 530 patients underwent an intracardiac operation that included a tricuspid valve procedure. The tricuspid valve was repaired in 351 patients (66%) and replaced in 179 (34%). Mean age was 56.9 years. Risk factors associated with tricuspid valve replacement included tricuspid stenosis (p = 0.02), jugular venous distention (p = 0.04), previous operation (p = 0.05), and angiographic severity of tricuspid valve incompetence (p less than 0.001). There were 78 hospital deaths (15%). Risk factors for hospital death included previous operation (p = 0.03), male gender (p = 0.03), hepatomegaly (p = 0.03), De Vega or Carpentier annuloplasty (repair group only), (p = 0.01), and older age at operation (p = 0.06). Ninety-eight percent of the patients were followed up. There were 185 late deaths (41%). The actuarial survival rate was 20% at 180 months. Risk factors for late death included male gender (p = 0.03), hepatomegaly (p = 0.04), and lack of postoperative warfarin therapy (p less than 0.001). Actuarial freedom from reoperation was 25.5% at 180 months. There was no difference in reoperation rates (p = 0.10) or survival (p = 0.42) whether the tricuspid valve had been repaired or replaced. We conclude that the requirement for surgical treatment of tricuspid valve insufficiency in patients with multivalvular disease constitutes a high risk group for cardiac surgery. Preoperative variables may predict the result of tricuspid valve replacement. Tricuspid valve replacement may be performed with the expectation of a low risk of valve-related events.\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been performed clinically to provide a substitute for myocardium, to assist dyskinetic ventricles, and to benefit patients with Chagas disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. Encouraging results have been observed for the patients; however, a conclusive experimental study is not available. How to use conditioned skeletal muscle for maximal augmentation of cardiac function in an appropriate animal model is the goal of this study. Dogs were used for heart failure induction, for single versus burst muscle stimulation, and for cardiac function augmentation. Muscle transformation was documented by histochemical evaluations. Propranolol infusion (3 mg/kg) induced temporary heart failure for 4 to 6 hours with significantly decreased cardiac output and blood pressure. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty significantly improved hemodynamic function during induced heart failure with better improvement by multiple (burst) stimulation as compared with single stimulation. Skeletal muscle fiber orientation is a critical factor for the success of this procedure. Our results indicated that skeletal muscle fiber oriented circumferential to the heart and perpendicular to the ventricular septum is the preferred procedure for dynamic cardiomyoplasty.\r"

Airway complications have been more prevalent in our own experience with double lung transplantation than in reports of combined heart-lung transplantation from other centers. Between November 1986 and March 1989, 16 patients underwent double lung transplantation. Allografts were preserved by topical hypothermic immersion in 12 patients and by pulmonary artery flush with cold crystalloid solution in the most recent four patients. Thirteen patients underwent tracheal anastomosis and the most recent three patients underwent bilateral bronchial anastomoses. Fatal ischemic necrosis of the donor trachea and both main bronchi developed in three patients. Preterminal airway ischemia developed in a patient who had systemic sepsis. Partial anastomotic dehiscence, which went on to form fibrous strictures necessitating endoscopic placement of silicone rubber airway stents, developed in two additional patients. Two other patients had late strictures and required subsequent placement of bifurcation stents. There was no relationship between development of airway complications and gas exchange in the donor lungs, lung ischemic time, early postoperative gas exchange, early postoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure, or frequency of early postoperative rejection. Severe postoperative hypotension occurred in five of eight patients with airway complications and in three of eight patients without airway complications.\r"

  ".U": "90097135\r", 
  ".W": "Right ventricular ejection fractions have been difficult to estimate clinically. It has been recently suggested that right ventricular ejection fractions can be calculated by thermodilution techniques with a fast-response thermistor and computer. These studies were performed to compare right ventricular ejection fractions obtained from thermodilution and biplane ventriculography. Ten pigs were instrumented with a right ventricular angiographic, thermodilution, and systemic arterial catheter. Right ventricular ejection fractions were determined by thermodilution and ventriculography at four times: (1) baseline, (2) infusion of isoporterenol (5 micrograms/min), (3) 50% of baseline mean arterial pressure produced by hemorrhage, and (4) reinfusion of isoproterenol during hypovolemia. A significant correlation existed between thermodilution and ventriculographic ejection fractions (r = 0.74, p = 0.004). However, during hypovolemia, thermodilution measurements of right ventricular ejection fraction were significantly lower than ventriculographic measurements (p less than 0.05). To determine if the position of the thermistor had a significant effect on thermodilution computations, right ventricular ejection fractions were computed by thermodilution in 10 additional pigs by means of a jugular and femoral insertion, as well as by ventriculography in each pig. Femoral insertion resulted in a greater distance from pulmonic valve to thermistor as compared with jugular placement (p = 0.005). Right ventricular ejection fractions obtained from femoral placement were significantly less than those obtained by jugular insertion (p = 0.008) and ventriculography (p = 0.006). There was no significant difference between jugular and ventriculographic ejection fractions (p = 0.35). Results from these studies demonstrates that thermodilution right ventricular ejection fraction measurements are strongly correlated to ventriculographic methods over a wide hemodynamic range and that improved accuracy is obtained when the pulmonic valve to thermistor distance is minimized. Thus thermodilution may provide a simple and repeatable means to monitor right ventricular function in the critical care setting.\r"

  ".U": "90097136\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the efficacy of intrapulmonary balloon counterpulsation in the management of right ventricular failure after right ventriculotomy, we undertook an experimental study in a swine model. To mimic the clinical settings more closely, (1) we left the automatic control of the heart intact (2) did not use cardiopulmonary bypass to support the left side of the heart, and (3) induced right ventricular failure by means of a generous surgical incision (50% to 70% of the anterior wall) of the right ventricle. The criteria set for right ventricular failure were (1) 50% increase in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, (2) 30% decrease in mean arterial pressure, and (3) 30% decrease in cardiac output. Right ventricular failure was attained in all animals studied: A 230% increase in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, a 43% decrease in cardiac output, and a 34% decrease in mean arterial pressure were evident after the right ventriculotomy. A specially designed intrapulmonary balloon catheter (Datascope Corp., Oakland, N.J.) was placed into the left pulmonary artery through the right ventricular outflow tract. A Datascope console was used for counterpulsation. Effects of counterpulsation for 40 minutes in a 1:1 mode were assessed after surgical induction of right ventricular failure in 14 swine. Each animal served as its own control. The mean hemodynamic changes are outlined: Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased by 48.9% (p = 0.01). Mean arterial pressure increased by 68.8% (p = 0.01) and cardiac output by 44.2% (p = 0.01). Histologic studies disclosed no morphologic damage to the pulmonary artery or valve in the specimens analyzed. In addition, these results were compared with those in a second group of seven swine in which right ventricular failure was induced by right ventriculotomy and a balloon was placed into the left pulmonary artery but not activated. These results of short-term counterpulsation should be evaluated in a longer term model so as to mimic more closely the clinical setting. If the hemodynamic benefits are duplicated, intrapulmonary balloon counterpulsation should be considered as a simple, effective device when right ventricular failure develops after right ventriculotomy. It effectively improves right ventricular function without damaging the pulmonary artery or valve.\r"

All systemic venous blood was directly led to the bilateral pulmonary arteries by end-to-side superior vena cava-right pulmonary anastomosis, diverting the inferior vena caval blood to the superior vena cava with a graft, ligating the inferior vena cava at its end and the pulmonary artery at its trunk, and shunting the coronary venous return from the right-ventricle to the left atrium. Nine consecutive dogs tolerated the procedures, and acute hemodynamic characteristics and responses to vasoactive drugs were observed for 5 hours throughout the following full studies. Cardiac output ranged from 66 to 102 ml/min/kg at a central venous pressure of 15 to 26 mm Hg. Norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and phentolamine were administered with the central venous pressure maintained constant at 18 mm Hg. Isoproterenol and phentolamine increased cardiac output while reducing pulmonary and/or systemic vascular resistance, with a possible concomitant inotropic effect in the former. Norepinephrine was detrimental, causing an increase in both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance.\r"

The conduction of a standard electrical stimulus applied to the nerve proximal to the cooled section was measured by detector electrodes sutured to the diaphragm. Nerve conduction of the applied stimulus ceased between 10 degrees and 12 degrees C but returned within seconds after the probe was removed. The delay in the return of conduction increased as nerve temperature decreased until at a temperature of 4 degrees C the ability to conduct did not return after 4 hours. The amount of fat surrounding the nerve and the blood flow rate along the cooled portion of the nerve were observed to ameliorate the effects of low temperature on stimulus conduction. Total body cooling also appears to offer some protection against loss of conduction.\r"

An advantage of this operation compared with heart-lung transplantation is retention of the recipient's heart. The operative dissection, however, may lead to interruption of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways to the heart and consequent denervation of the native heart. The cardiac innervation of seven double lung transplant recipients was investigated by the heart rate response to carotid sinus massage, the Valsalva maneuver, intravenous injection of atropine, and exercise. Five single lung and two heart-lung transplant recipients were studied for comparison. Of the seven double lung transplant recipients, three had abnormal responses to carotid sinus massage, six to the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, and five to the release phase of the Valsalva maneuver. Three of six double lung transplant recipients tested had no response to intravenous injection of atropine, and five of seven patients had an abnormal recovery of heart rate after maximal exercise. No patient had a normal response to all interventions, and three patients had responses compatible with complete cardiac denervation. It is concluded that cardiac denervation may occur after double lung transplantation, most likely caused by surgical interruption of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways during dissection of the recipient's trachea.\r"

  ".W": "Phrenic nerve pacing can be used to free a quadriplegic patient from ventilatory dependency. During a 6-year period (1982 to 1988), 23 patients with an age range of 17 to 63 years (mean 31 years) underwent implantation of a phrenic nerve pacemaker because of ventilatory dependency resulting from quadriplegia. Fourteen patients had a unilateral phrenic nerve implant and nine had a bilateral implant. The time from injury to implantation was 12 to 16 weeks. The site of implantation was the cervical phrenic nerve in 13 patients and the thoracic phrenic nerve in 10 patients. During the past 24 months, only a transthoracic approach has been used. The indication for pacing was failure to be weaned from ventilatory support in all patients. Failure to stimulate the phrenic nerve at implantation was noted in three patients, despite preoperative testing indicating an acceptable response. There were no deaths, and minor complications developed in three patients. Follow-up is available in all patients: Eight patients are completely free from the ventilator; nine patients are in markedly improved condition but require the ventilator at night; three patients are in moderately improved condition; and three patients had no response. Three patients required reexploration for component failure from 6 weeks to 18 months after implantation.\r"
