This dual specificity is determined by a single receptor structure consisting of a clone-specific alpha beta heterodimer. Because both the alpha and beta subunits possess unique combining-site-containing V regions, it remains an open issue as to what contribution each of the two chains of the receptor makes to the antigen versus MHC recognition specificities of the complete dimer present on any given T cell or in the T-cell pool as a whole. In the present work, we have used DNA-mediated gene transfer to express a new alpha or beta chain in a recipient murine T-cell hybridoma possessing a related antigen but distinct MHC specificity compared to the receptor-gene donor. Our results demonstrate that a beta-gene transfected hybridoma expresses new receptors with a predictable hybrid specificity, establishing that the beta chain has the predominant role in MHC molecule recognition in this model.\r"

MtDNA RFLPs have previously been attributed to nucleotide changes within restriction endonuclease recognition sites or to small insertion-deletion mutations. We now report that RFLPs detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can also result from single nucleotide substitutions which alter the mobility of small- to medium-sized restriction fragments that incorporate the sequence. We have defined the mutation responsible at two loci and have identified several possible additional loci. When screening human mtDNAs with multiple restriction endonucleases, such mutations can be misidentified as insertion-deletion mutations or counted as multiple polymorphic restriction sites. This can lead to errors in constructing restriction maps and estimating sequence diversity.\r"

Because blocking the action of E-cadherin by monoclonal antibodies causes dispersion of compact cell colonies, this molecule is thought to be an important factor for maintenance of multicellular systems. To demonstrate directly that E-cadherin is involved in cell-cell adhesion, we cloned full-length cDNA encoding E-cadherin from F9 cells and introduced it into L fibroblasts deficient in E-cadherin. These L cells acquire strong Ca2+-dependent aggregating activity by expressing the E-cadherin derived from the introduced cDNA and were morphologically transformed so as to form colonies in which cells were tightly connected to each other.\r"

We determined the likelihood of inheritance of the gene for HD in 13 persons, using DNA polymorphism studies. Of these, eight persons had a greater than 90% probability of being presymptomatic heterozygotes for HD. Three of these eight subjects had caudate glucose utilization detected by PET that was more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the age-matched control mean. Measurement of caudate glucose utilization in the other five presumed presymptomatic heterozygotes revealed results between 1 and 2 SD below the mean. Five persons had a less than 10% likelihood of having inherited the abnormal gene for HD. Of these, four had normal rates of glucose utilization in the caudate nuclei. However, one individual with DNA results indicating a low risk of developing HD had abnormally low measures of caudate glucose utilization. This suggests that a recombination had occurred between the linked marker and the gene in this person. These studies suggest that PET studies of caudate glucose utilization may help to confirm results of DNA studies in some persons, and may provide an opportunity to detect when DNA results may be incorrect due to recombination.\r"

Gynecologic and psychiatric admissions were more frequent in the former than in the latter group. Of the 30 hysterectomized women, only six had had malignant or premalignant changes in the uterus, whereas in 22 cases the removed organs had been normal. These results suggest that a somatization disorder might have been the underlying cause for the hysterectomy as well as for the symptoms and complaints leading to referral to the neurologic service.

  ".W": "The CD23 (BLAST-2) antigen, recently identified as the low-affinity IgE receptor of B lymphocytes, has also been implicated as the focus for growth-promoting signals delivered to activated B cells by a low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (BCGF). Here we show that IgE and BCGF can coordinate B-lymphocyte growth through their opposing effects on the CD23 molecule. While the activation of purified quiescent B cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to the induction of 45-kDa CD23 at the surface membrane, the inclusion of IgE increased CD23 expression by a factor of approximately equal to 5. The addition of BCGF resulted in the rapid release of a 35-kDa form of CD23 from the cell surface. This shed molecule is associated with autocrine growth factor activity. Substantially more of this material was generated by BCGF acting on cells that had been stimulated in the presence of IgE. The combined effects of IgE and BCGF on DNA synthesis in activated B cells were more than additive. IgE similarly augmented the stimulatory capacity of a CD23 antibody that mimics the biological actions of BCGF. Binding of the anti-receptor antibody to its 45-kDa target at the B-cell surface also prompted the release of the 35-kDa soluble species. These results demonstrate a pleiotropy in the CD23 molecule with regard to both ligand binding and the subsequent behavior of the receptor. The ability of this single receptor to orchestrate a B-lymphocyte response through a variety of ligands and its role in normal and transformed autocrine growth are discussed.\r"

This system, therefore, provides a polyclonal model for B-cell inactivation by antigen-antibody complexes. T-cell-derived B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 acts synergistically with submitogenic concentrations of F(ab')2 anti-Ig to induce B-cell proliferation. We show here that B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 and intact anti-Ig also induce B cells to synthesize DNA. However, B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 does not induce inositol phospholipid breakdown, does not mobilize Ca2+ in B cells, nor does it influence the magnitude of these responses provoked by intact anti-Ig.\r"

Investigations on this tumor have been limited so far by the difficulty of culturing NPC cells for long periods. C15 is an NPC tumor that has been successfully carried in nude mice for greater than 2 yr. C15 cells isolated from the animal were shown to produce a soluble factor with interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity. Its biochemical (Mr, approximately equal to 17,000; pI approximately equal to 5) and immunological properties are identical to those of IL-1 alpha. RNA gel blot analysis showed IL-1 alpha, but not IL-1 beta, transcripts in C15 cells, in sharp contrast to monocytes that express IL-1 beta predominantly. Media from short-term cultures of fresh NPC biopsies also contained a strong IL-1 activity. Several lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained by EBV infection of normal B lymphocytes have been shown to produce IL-1 and use it as an autocrine growth factor. The production of IL-1 by malignant EBV-containing epithelial cells indicates that different types of EBV-infected cells produce IL-1. A relationship might exist between EBV and constitutive production of IL-1. The IL-1 produced by the malignant epithelial cells in vivo could stimulate the development of the pronounced T-cell infiltrate observed in NPC tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Using DNase I and Alu I endonuclease analysis of a site-directed CC-1065-[N3-adenine]DNA adduct in a 117-base-pair fragment from M13mp1 DNA, we have demonstrated that CC-1065 produces an asymmetric effect on DNA conformation that extends more than one helix turn to the 5' side of the covalently modified adenine. CC-1065 is a potent antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces zelensis, which is believed to mediate its cytotoxic effects through covalent binding to DNA. Previous studies have demonstrated that CC-1065 binds covalently to N3 of adenine and lies within the minor groove of DNA spanning a 4-base-pair sequence to the 5' side of the modified adenine. DNase I footprinting of this site-directed CC-1065-DNA adduct on the noncovalently modified strand shows that inhibition of cleavage occurs over a 12-base region, which is bordered on the 3' side by a site of 2-fold enhancement of cleavage. On the covalently modified strand a much less pronounced inhibition/enhancement pattern of cleavage occurs as far as 11 bases to the 5' side of the covalently modified adenine. While Hae III is able to cleave the DNA on both strands on the 3' side of the covalently modified adenine, Alu I is only able to cleave the covalently modified strand on the 5' side of the adduct. By taking into account the recently published structure of DNase I, we are able to interpret these results and develop a model for the effect of CC-1065 on local DNA structure. In this model, we propose selective drug-induced distortion of the covalently modified strand as a consequence of the alkylation of adenine by CC-1065.\r"

This complex can be isolated in pure form from an affinity matrix consisting of an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing heptapeptide and is specifically immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the vitronectin receptor of human melanoma cells. These data suggest that this complex is one member of a large family of cell adhesion receptors. One of the mAbs, LM609, inhibits the attachment of human endothelial cells to fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin yet has no effect on the attachment of these cells to fibronectin, collagen, or laminin. In addition, mAb LM609 inhibits attachment of endothelial cells to an immobilized synthetic peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. This adhesion receptor appears structurally similar to the IIb/IIIa glycoprotein complex expressed on platelets yet is antigenically distinct, since mAb LM609 fails to recognize IIb/IIIa glycoproteins. This receptor organizes in clusters on endothelial cells during their attachment to von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, or the Arg-Gly-Asp-containing heptapeptide. The data presented in this report suggest that Arg-Gly-Asp recognition may play a significant role in biological events associated with vascular proliferation.\r"

Evidence is also presented that the 3'-UTR with its conserved (TATT)n motif probably has multiple functions in lymphoid cells operating both at the chromosomal level, where the sequence may be involved in the specific binding of the nonhistone chromatin high mobility group protein HMG-I, and at the RNA level, where the conserved sequence is involved in selective posttranscriptional mRNA degradation by a lymphocyte-specific nuclease(s). These results suggest a complex in vivo role for the 3'-UTR of bIL-2 cDNA and the conserved (TATT)n sequences found within it.

  ".W": "The Philadelphia chromosome [t(9;22)-(q34;q11)] is the cytogenetic hallmark of human chronic myelogenous leukemia. RNA splicing joins sequences from a gene on chromosome 22 (BCR) across the translocation breakpoint to a portion of the ABL oncogene from chromosome 9, resulting in a chimeric protein (P210) that is an active tyrosine kinase. Although strongly correlated with this specific human neoplasm, and implicated as an oncogene by analogy to the gene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the P210 gene had not been tested directly for oncogenic potential in hematopoietic cells. We have used a retroviral gene-transfer system to express P210 in mouse bone marrow cells. When infected bone marrow is plated under conditions for long-term culture of cells of the B-lymphoid lineage, cells expressing high amounts of P210 tyrosine kinase dominate the culture and rapidly lead to clonal outgrowths of immature lymphoid cells. Expression of P210 is growth-stimulatory but not sufficient for full oncogenic behavior. Some clonal lines progress toward a fully malignant phenotype as judged by increased cloning efficiency in agar suspension and frequency and rapidity of tumor induction in syngeneic mice. Such in vitro systems should be useful in evaluating the sequential and perhaps synergistic involvement of the P210 gene and other oncogenes as models for the progressive changes observed in human chronic myelogenous leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "The availability of an anti-nicotine monoclonal antibody has made it possible to further establish the nature of the nicotine recognition proteins purified from rat brain by affinity chromatography and to provide a highly sensitive assay for determining [3H]nicotine binding to the purified material. An enantiomeric analogue of nicotine, (-)-6-hydroxymethyl-nicotine, was used to prepare the affinity column. In addition, with the use of anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody, it was confirmed that the recognition site for nicotine resides on a protein complex composed of two components with molecular masses of 62 and 57 kDa. It was also demonstrated that the same two proteins could be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with the use of an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody. With the use of the anti-nicotine antibody to measure [3H]nicotine binding, the purified material was shown to bind 250 pmol/mg of protein. By utilizing a procedure in which the purified receptor protein was conjugated to membranes by disulfide bonds, a binding activity of 80 pmol/mg was obtained. With the availability of stereospecific monoclonal antibodies to (-)-nicotine as well as monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies derived when the anti-nicotine antibodies were used as immunogens, additional procedures became available for the further characterization of the purified nicotine receptor and examining its (-)-[3H]nicotine-binding characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study on 100 homosexual male volunteers was designed to examine immunological function in relation to sexual activity and infection with the human T cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV-III). Complete data were available for 71 men. In a comparison with 100 age-matched heterosexual men, the study group of 100 men had a significantly higher mean serum IgG level (12.1 +/- SD 2.7 g/l vs. 10.9 +/- 2.4 g/l, p less than 0.01) and a significantly lower mean number of CD4 (T4) cells (845 +/- 310 X 10(-6)/l vs. 1128 +/- 375; p less than 0.01). For the study group, seropositivity for anti-HTLV-III was present initially in 22 per cent and was associated with a higher mean level of serum IgG and lower mean number of CD4 cells. Among seropositive homosexual men a low CD4/8 ratio was attributable to low numbers of CD4 cells in those without lymphadenopathy and to high numbers of CD8 cells in those with lymphadenopathy. For the seronegative homosexual men, a low CD4/8 ratio as a result of an increased CD8 cell count was present in 12 of 60, and was associated with numerous sexual partners and semen culture positive for cytomegalovirus. In two seropositive subjects a low CD4/8 ratio due to a decrease in the CD4 cell count was predictive of the development of AIDS by some two years. For the 71 men with complete data over two years, indices of cell-mediated immunity, including mean counts of CD4 cells, the CD4/8 ratio, and score for recall of cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity increased during the first year but not during the second year in both seropositive and seronegative subjects. These increases occurred in association with changes in sexual practices and activity, but could not be attributed to any one particular factor.\r"

The validity of the method was established by the high correlation (r = .92) between in vivo SPECT measurement of the concentration of glucoheptonate labeled with technetium-99m and in vitro measurement of the concentration of the drug in specimens of nine of the same tumors obtained at surgery. The in vivo concentration of intravenously injected bleomycin labeled with cobalt-57 was measured over time in 14 human lung tumors. Significant differences were found in the uptake of bleomycin by the tumors, even those with the same histologic characteristics, when the concentration over time, the tumor/blood ratio at 30 minutes, and the tumor cumulative concentration were measured in vivo. Since the drug concentration in the blood was not related to the concentration in the tumor (r = .54), uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs should be measured in each patient individually.\r"

Tc-99m HM-PAO SPECT was shown to have the following advantages: It reflected perfusion changes, was more sensitive than CT in demonstrating more lesions, and demonstrated lesions at an earlier stage than those demonstrated with CT. Different types of lesions, as evidenced by cerebral perfusion changes, have been described and categorized.

The molecular map of this locus was completely defined by deletion mapping and restriction mapping. Restriction fragments were resolved by standard agarose electrophoresis and field inversion electrophoresis. These studies demonstrate that the deletions in this locus, which occur during the formation of a functional T cell receptor gamma-chain gene, range from 50 to 145 kilobases in length. These studies also provide a structural basis for understanding the development of the gamma-chain peptide repertoire, and extends the potential of the emerging pulsed-field electrophoretic technology.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of c-myb proto-oncogene messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein has been detected principally in tumors and in normal tissue of hematopoietic origin. In each hematopoietic lineage examined, expression of the c-myb gene is markedly downregulated during hematopoietic maturation. However, the mechanism by which differential expression of the c-myb gene is regulated is not known. In murine B-lymphoid tumor cell lines, the amount of steady-state c-myb mRNA is 10 to more than 100 times greater in pre-B cell lymphomas than in B cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas. The downregulation of c-myb mRNA correlates with events at the pre-B cell-B cell junction. Differential expression of c-myb mRNA levels detected between a pre-B cell lymphoma and a mature B cell lymphoma is now shown to be mediated by a block to transcription elongation in the first intron of the c-myb locus. In addition, this developmentally regulated difference in transcriptional activity is correlated with alterations in higher order chromatin structure as reflected by changes in the patterns of hypersensitivity to deoxyribonuclease I at the 5' end of the c-myb transcription unit. Regulation of transcription elongation may provide a more sensitive mechanism for rapidly increasing and decreasing mRNA levels in response to external stimuli than regulation of the initiation of transcription.\r"

  ".W": "The protein portion of the immunosuppressive glycoprotein uromodulin is identical to the Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein and is synthesized in the kidney. Evidence that the glycoproteins are the same is based on amino acid sequence identity, immunologic cross-reactivity, and tissue localization to the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Nucleic acid sequencing of clones for uromodulin isolated from a complementary DNA bank from human kidney predicts a protein 639 amino acids in length, including a 24--amino acid leader sequence and a cysteine-rich mature protein with eight potential glycosylation sites. Uromodulin and preparations of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein bind to recombinant murine interleukin-1 (rIL-1) and human rIL-1 alpha, rIL-1 beta, and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF). Uromodulin isolated from urine of pregnant women by lectin adherence is more immunosuppressive than material isolated by the original salt-precipitation protocol of Tamm and Horsfall. Immunohistologic studies demonstrate that rIL-1 and rTNF bind to the same area of the human kidney that binds to antiserum specific for uromodulin. Thus, uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein) may function as a unique renal regulatory glycoprotein that specifically binds to and regulates the circulating activity of a number of potent cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF.\r"

  ".U": "87320041\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical course of patients with leukemia, specifically after treatment, is complicated by opportunistic infections, often derived from the gastrointestinal tract. Four hundred and thirty-eight patients with leukemia were treated at the Arizona Health Sciences Center from 1976 to 1985. Fifty-five (13 per cent) had 60 major gastrointestinal complications develop. Thirty-seven were treated medically with a mortality rate of 51 per cent, while 18 who were treated surgically had a 17 per cent mortality rate. These infections usually occur during induction or consolidation chemotherapy. Positive blood cultures and white blood cell counts of less than 2,500 per millimeter are a frequent occurrence. The most common complications of the gastrointestinal tract are enterocolitis, perirectal sepsis and bleeding. Because of the combined defects in phagocytosis (neutropenia), antibody production and cell mediated immunity, opportunistic infections (such as viral, fungal, parasitic or bacterial) are frequent and often lethal, despite routine antibiotic coverage. A protocol to identify a subset of patients with septic leukemia who may require emergency surgical treatment is vital since death in this group is most commonly from undiagnosed sepsis or progression of hematologic defects. This protocol should include repeated physical examinations, daily roentgenograms of the abdomen, liberal use of endoscopy, contrast roentgenography and computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. Extensive surgical procedures can be safely carried out in patients with leukemia. The diagnosis of leukemia should not be a deterrent to emergency surgical exploration.\r"

Moderate concentrations of androgen receptors (33.4 +/- 5.4 fmol/mg protein) were detected in 35 (65%), whereas high levels of progesterone binding components (236 +/- 35 fmol/mg protein) were demonstrated in 48 (89%) tumors. The androgen receptor binding activity was positively correlated with the progesterone receptor binding activity (rs = 0.38, p less than 0.05). This relationship is suggestive of an androgen regulation of the progesterone receptor via the androgen receptor system. The presence of androgen and progesterone receptors in a large proportion of meningiomas, and the tendency for a dependence of androgen receptor and progesterone receptor binding activity on the histological subtype could have implications for tumor therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic value of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord was studied in rats injured by acute compression of the spinal cord. Twenty adult Wistar rats underwent cord compression at T6-7 by the extradural clip compression technique at a force of 125 g for 1 minute. After injury and group randomization, stimulating electrodes were placed extradurally, proximal and distal to the injury site, and attached to a small, implantable receiver-stimulator. The receiver was secured to the paraspinal muscles and implanted subcutaneously, overlying the thoracic spine. The animals were maintained in specially designed cages with encircling antennae attached to radio frequency transmitters. The 10 treatment animals were subjected to a 460-kHz electromagnetic field, pulsed at a frequency of 10 Hz. The receivers converted the pulsed radio frequency into square-wave pulses at the cord electrodes (width 1 ms, frequency 10 Hz). The 10 control animals were exposed to a similar field but with a frequency below the range of the tuned receiver, and therefore they did not receive the square-wave pulse. Clinical recovery was assessed by the inclined plane technique which measures the maximum angle of inclination attained without falling. After 15 weeks of continuous spinal cord stimulation, the inclined plane performance was not significantly different between the two groups (treatment group mean, 44.4 +/- 5.4; control group mean, 41.7 +/- 7.9). This is the first experimental study of the effect of long-term continuous electrical stimulation on spinal cord recovery in mammals. The methods required and the technical aspects involved in achieving continuous stimulation, and the guidelines for future study of this modality are discussed.\r"

Our management of three patients with massive bleeding due to duodenal varices stimulated a review of this subject. Thirteen cases of this condition were previously reported. Endoscopic examination of the entire duodenal mucosa is essential to document bleeding from duodenal varices. Medical therapies, including vasopressin and endoscopic sclerotherapy, have had limited success in controlling active duodenal variceal bleeding. Duodenal varix suture ligation or resection also resulted in a high rate of rebleeding. End-to-side portocaval shunt was the most effective procedure in stopping acute and subsequent bleeding in patients with duodenal varices. Despite therapy with or without portosystemic shunt, mortality risk is high in Child's class C patients and in patients with emergency duodenal variceal bleeding.\r"

Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a high correlation between contralateral flow reduction and the degree of flow impairment in the infarcted area (r = 0.941, p = 0.0014) but not with age, risk factor profile, blood pressure, PCO2, hematocrit, or duration of stroke.

  ".W": "During a 5-year period, 416 long-term double-lumen central venous catheters were inserted into 288 patients. In these patients, 106 catheter venograms and nine upper extremity venograms were performed. All studies were reviewed retrospectively to determine the nature and prevalence of noninfectious catheter-related complications, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of streptokinase therapy, and to determine if catheter venography should be performed before streptokinase therapy is started. Noninfectious complications occurred in 66 (23%) patients. Complications that resulted in catheter malfunction included deposition of fibrin around the catheter tip (formation of a fibrin sheath) in 44 (57%) instances, a constricting suture in six, abutment of the catheter tip against the venous wall in eight, catheter leak in two, and migration of the catheter completely out of the vein in three. Venous thrombosis developed in 11 patients. Treatment with low doses of streptokinase successfully relieved catheter obstruction due to a fibrin sheath in 27 (87%) of 31 instances. No bleeding complications occurred. Five patients had malpositioned catheters in the azygous, axillary, or internal jugular veins. By use of a deflector wire or snare inserted via the femoral vein, all five were relocated successfully into the superior vena cava. Recognition of noninfectious complications associated with use of long-term catheters is important for institution of appropriate therapy, which in many instances obviates removal of the catheter. Formation of a fibrin sheath in only 57% of cases of catheter malfunction provides an argument for performing catheter venography before streptokinase therapy is started. Low-dose streptokinase therapy for long-term central venous catheters occluded by a fibrin sheath is safe and efficacious.\r"

Poorest correlation between findings on CT and findings at autopsy has been described for left-sided lymph nodes, particularly those in the left peribronchial region (American Thoracic Society node station 10L), suggesting that cancers of the left lung might be less well staged by CT than cancers of the right lung. The relationship between the accuracy of mediastinal lymph node staging and the location of the primary lung cancer was examined in a retrospective study. In 103 patients with non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma who had preoperative CT evaluation of the mediastinum, the accuracy of preoperative staging was 81% for tumors of the right lung (70 patients) and 97% for tumors of the left lung (33 patients). The conclusion is that cancers of the left lung are staged at least as accurately as cancers of the right lung, despite the fact that left-sided mediastinal nodes are depicted more poorly on CT. Subcarinal and crossover (contralateral) nodal metastases and a low prevalence of metastasis involving only region 10L were the most important factors minimizing staging differences based on the site of the primary tumor.\r"

This technique was used in three patients with documented ventricular septal defects (VSDs) to obtain transverse and oblique sections of the heart spanning the cardiac cycle. In all patients, cine MR imaging showed high-velocity turbulent blood flow across the defect as areas of low signal intensity extending from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. In the oblique sections oriented parallel to the interventricular septum it was possible to identify the cross-sectional area of the VSD. Quantification of the left-to-right shunt was performed by comparing left and right ventricular stroke volumes determined from end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes of both ventricles. Cine MR imaging provides important functional information and anatomic detail in patients with VSD and may be useful for diagnosis, determination of severity, and noninvasive monitoring of the disease.\r"

Fine-needle aspiration cytology was used to establish the histologic diagnosis in 11 patients with no history of hepatic malignancy. The other six patients had a pathologic confirmation of hepatic malignancy by open biopsy before admission. Pretreatment angiography showed extravasation of contrast material from the hepatic tumor in four patients (24%). In the other 13 patients, only hypervascular tumors were seen. Successful hemostasis was achieved in all patients. Fourteen patients survived after the embolization; the other three died immediately after embolization. Of the 14 patients, 11 died later (survival time ranged from 16 to 386 days). The remaining three patients are still alive at 3, 7, and 15 months, respectively, after the procedure. No serious complications related to embolization were encountered. Most patients had pain and fever.

Despite the wide range of contrast parameters available for MR imaging, similar limitations have been found with this technique. Magnetopharmaceuticals have the ability to enhance tumor-spleen contrast and improve lesion detectability. In this study, a rodent model of cancer metastasized to the spleen was used to evaluate the potential of superparamagnetic ferrite particles as a tissue-specific reticuloendothelial contrast agent. Other studies have shown ferrite to have little or no toxicity. Without contrast material, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the spleen could not be distinguished from normal splenic parenchyma on in vivo MR images. At a dose of 50 mumol Fe/kg, the T2 relaxation time of spleen decreased by 77%, while tumor T2 was essentially unchanged (p less than .005). Intrasplenic tumors 4-6 mm in size became readily detectable on in vivo MR images after the administration of ferrite particles. Lesion conspicuity, quantitated by the tumor-spleen contrast-to-noise ratio, showed a 43-fold increase. Ferrite particles show great promise as a contrast agent to enhance the detection of focal splenic lesions.\r"

Fifteen patients were evaluated for union of previous surgical carpal fusions; eight patients were evaluated for healing of scaphoid fractures; and the other four patients had miscellaneous disorders, including a midcarpal dislocation with a scaphoid fracture. High-resolution CT clearly showed whether the carpal fusions were united. In addition, metallic fixation devices were easy to locate and did not significantly degrade image quality. Osseous union of healing scaphoid fractures was reliably assessed. We conclude that high-resolution CT of the wrist is a useful method for evaluating surgical carpal fusions and various disorders of the scaphoid.\r"

  ".W": "Wrist arthrography is often used to evaluate the integrity of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments. This may be difficult when the ligaments are obscured by contrast material in standard radiographic projections, despite filming under fluoroscopic observation during the injection of contrast material. When superimposition occurs, we recommend fluoroscopic positioning of the wrist to optimally visualize the individual ligaments in profile. We applied this technique in performing 240 wrist arthrograms, 88 (37%) of which had scapholunate and/or lunotriquetral ligament tears. As a result, a definite diagnosis of the specific site of ligamentous disruption was possible in all but one case. Using this technique, we also identified six short-segment or \"pinhole\" ligamentous tears. Identification of commonly interrupted ligaments in profile by using fluoroscopy after contrast material has been injected may allow identification of specific ligamentous disruptions or short-segment tears, as well as a diagnosis of a specific anatomic abnormality that otherwise would not be possible.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle hemangiomas are uncommon tumors of young adults. More than 90% are misdiagnosed preoperatively. Plain-film examinations, bone scans, CT studies, and angiography may not always be specific for this tumor. Seven MR examinations were performed in five young adult patients with pathologically proved skeletal muscle hemangiomas. All five hemangiomas showed high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The signal intensity in these tumors was less than that of subcutaneous fat on relatively T1-weighted images and greater than that of fat on relatively T2-weighted images. Four tumors had a serpiginous pattern. Four patients had focal muscle atrophy. Three patients had all three findings (high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images, serpiginous pattern, and associated focal muscle atrophy) while the other two patients had at least two of the three findings. These three patients did not undergo angiography or needle biopsies before surgery because the MR findings were highly suggestive of hemangioma. Our experience with this small series of patients suggests that skeletal muscle hemangiomas have a consistent appearance on MR. MR may be able to contribute significantly to the preoperative diagnosis of this tumor and may also supply valuable information about the extent of the lesion.\r"

The sites of tumor deposition were subdivided by location: I, nodal; II, extranodal, lymphatic (Waldeyer's ring); and III, extranodal, extralymphatic (orbit, sinonasal, deep facial spaces, mandible, salivary gland, skin, and larynx). The CT appearance of NHL in each of the three locations was analyzed for characteristic CT signatures. Nodal NHL was suspected when CT showed multiple, large, homogeneous lymph nodes, often in unusual nodal chains of the head and neck. Extranodal, lymphatic NHL of Waldeyer's ring was indistinguishable from squamous cell carcinoma of this area unless synchronous tumor deposit in an extranodal, extralymphatic location was also present. When NHL was in nodes and/or Waldeyer's ring, CT-derived information was of limited clinical value since treatment was unfocused (chemotherapy and/or large-field radiotherapy). The CT appearances of extranodal, extralymphatic NHL was generally not distinguishable from other malignancies of these areas. However, CT-derived information regarding deep-tissue tumor size and extent was critical to planning the radiotherapy ports.\r"

  ".W": "Current-generation CT scanners enable the visualization in vivo of structures and substructures that were previously unobservable. Certainly the orbit and optic nerve/sheath complex have demonstrated a great number of pathologic and normal anatomic variations. It has been found in patients with elevated intracranial pressure that what was previously thought to be simple papilledema in fact masks a surprisingly large component of optic papilla protrusion. There may be a variable amount of increased intercellular/axonal fluid within the optic disk in patients with increased intracranial pressure; however, a significant factor in the \"swollen disk\" is the simple transmission of pressure along the optic nerve sheath to the papilla, causing it to bulge. Further investigations with dynamic CT reveal that there is decreased perfusion of the optic disk in the active phase of severe increased intracranial pressure in patients with papilledema and/or protrusion as compared with normal control subjects. This depressed flow pattern seems to originate subacutely and appears to resolve in certain patients after normalization of the elevated pressure. These findings apparently indicate that clinical intervention in cases of intracranial hypertension to restore the hemodynamic status of the optic disk would be timely, and thereby avert irreversible damage. This suggests and supports the theory that increased intracranial pressure may lead to rapid vision loss by the mechanical mechanism of pressure projected directly to the junction of the optic nerve and optic nerve head, leading to decreased perfusion, ischemia, axonal flow stasis, and resultant optic nerve atrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1980 and 1985, 35 patients (26 women and nine men) who had coronal CT scans of the sella turcica for suspected ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma underwent transsphenoidal exploration. The CT examinations were performed with a fourth-generation EMI scanner (CT 7070). The reports of the preoperative CT examinations were compared with the findings at transsphenoidal exploration; in cases with negative CT scans, the decision to operate was based on biochemical evidence of Cushing's disease. In 27 patients, distinct adenomas were found at surgery; in the eight others, total hypophysectomy (four cases) or resection of the central core of the pituitary gland (four cases) was performed. Three patients had macroadenomas, all of which had been identified correctly on preoperative CT scan. Among the 24 microadenomas (less than 10 mm diameter), 14 had been correctly identified on preoperative CT scan while 10 were found in patients with negative scans. The CT examinations in these 35 patients showed probable adenomas in 20 cases, of which 17 (85%) were confirmed at surgery. In the other three cases (15%), adenomas were not found. Among the 15 patients with negative CT scans, 10 (66.6%) had distinct adenomas found at surgery. Coronal CT scans for ACTH-secreting adenomas had a sensitivity of 63%, a specificity of 62.5%, and an overall accuracy rate of 62.8%. Thus, in our experience, CT scanning with current state-of-the-art equipment has poor diagnostic accuracy in Cushing's disease. The possible reasons for this are that most of the adenomas in this series were microadenomas less than 6 mm in diameter, and that ACTH microadenomas probably show almost the same degree of enhancement with contrast medium as the surrounding normal pituitary tissue.\r"

The average mamillopontine distance was 1.15 cm for the normal group, 1.2 cm for patients with atrophy, and 7.5 mm for patients with hydrocephalus. A reduction of the mamillopontine distance below 1.0 cm was found in 22 patients with hydrocephalus, 5 patients with atrophy, and 15 normal patients. Dilatation of the anterior third ventricle was noted in 21 patients in the hydrocephalus group and in none of the patients in the atrophy and normal groups. The average thickness of the corpus callosum at the level of the foramen of Monro was 6 mm in normal subjects and was reduced below 6 mm in 16 of the hydrocephalus patients. Smooth elevation of the corpus callosum was noted in 20 hydrocephalus patients, in 2 patients with atrophy, and in none of the normal patients. MR improves the accuracy of diagnosis in patients with hydrocephalus both because of its ability to show small obstructing lesions that are not depicted by CT and because the mass effect of the distended supratentorial ventricles produces anatomic changes that are delineated with precision by MR.\r"

These might be considered \"secondary\" parameters because they are not set directly but are instead specified indirectly by setting the \"primary\" parameters: field of view; projections (phase-encoded or readout); slice thickness and gap; number of excitations; and the sequence parameter times--repetition, echo delay, and inversion. Together, the primary and secondary parameters specify the MR pulsing sequence. Many of these parameters are interrelated such that setting one parameter indirectly affects another. Parameter specification is thus an iterative procedure that involves compromises to achieve an optimum relative to some predefined criteria. In this article, we examine the interrelationships between the primary and secondary parameters that specify the spin-echo pulsing sequence and suggest an algorithmic approach for selecting the best sequence parameters.\r"

This technique provides a two-dimensional resolvable contrast scale that may produce images of improved information content. The versatility of the method, termed hybrid color display, is demonstrated by using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, chemical-shift, and gradient-recalled-acquisition-into-steady-state (GRASS) images. This technique may facilitate MR interpretation by enhancing anatomic and pathologic conspicuity and by expediting review.\r"

MAM is stable over a broad range of pH and tolerates proteolytic enzyme exposure over 24 hr in vitro. MAM possesses a much larger magnetic moment than do paramagnetic contrast agents. The transverse relaxation rate (R2) of MAM can be as much as 40 times the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1). In vitro spectroscopy studies confirm the potency of MAM in promoting T2 relaxation at concentrations of 10-1000 mg/l. Preliminary studies in rabbits and dogs show that in contrast to oral gadolinium-DTPA, which causes increased signal in bowel, MAM causes marked signal loss in the stomach and small bowel on both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences. Radionuclide labeling studies of MAM suspension with 99mTc show no evidence of absorption of MAM suspension from the gastrointestinal tract in small animals. Superparamagnetic suspensions such as MAM that reduce bowel signal on T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences offer the unique benefit of reducing motion artifacts throughout the gastrointestinal tract, which should allow for improved evaluation of intra- and retroperitoneal diseases, particularly with high-field strength and gradient-echo \"fast-scan techniques.\" Unlike paramagnetic material, MAM appears effective as a small-bowel contrast material.\r"

An alternative is to make prints on paper using \"dry silver\" technology. These prints are made by a camera that uses silver-coated paper. The paper is developed as it exits the camera and passes over a heating element. Thus dry silver paper is processed \"dry,\" whereas standard film or print paper is processed in a chemical bath. The prints are viewed by reflected rather than transmitted light. We compared the diagnostic quality of the dry silver prints with that of conventional multiformat, transmitted-light images. Radiologists were asked to make diagnoses from both types of images. The results showed that the diagnoses made from the prints were identical to those made from the films. Furthermore, when the images were labeled with the diagnosis, there was no difference between the two formats in the information conveyed to the referring physician. We conclude that dry silver, reflection prints can provide an inexpensive, convenient method of making visual information available on patients' charts.\r"

  ".W": "Cold is thought to provoke angina in patients with coronary disease either by an increase in myocardial demand or an increase in coronary vascular resistance. We investigated and compared the effects of cold pressor stimulation and symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise on regional myocardial perfusion in 35 patients with stable angina and coronary disease and in 10 normal subjects. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed with positron emission tomography and rubidium-82. Following cold pressor stimulation 24 of 35 patients demonstrated significant abnormalities of regional myocardial perfusion with reduced cation uptake in affected regions of myocardium: 52 +/- 9 to 43 +/- 9 (p less than 0.001 vs normal subjects). Among these 24 patients only nine developed ST depression and only seven had angina. In contrast, 29 of 35 patients underwent supine exercise, and abnormal regional myocardial perfusion occurred in all 29, with a reduction in cation intake from 48 +/- 10 to 43 +/- 14 (p less than 0.001 vs normal subjects). Angina was present in 27 of 29 and ST depression in 25 of 29. Although the absolute decrease in cation uptake was somewhat greater following cold as opposed to exercise, the peak heart rate after cold was significantly lower than that after exercise (82 +/- 12 vs 108 +/- 16 bpm, p less than 0.05). Peak systolic blood pressures after cold and exercise were similar (159 +/- 24 vs 158 +/- 28). Thus, cold produces much more frequent asymptomatic disturbances of regional myocardial perfusion in patients with stable angina and coronary disease than is suggested by pain or ECG changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the efficacy of nadolol in the prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 148 patients undergoing elective CABG were randomized in double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to receive either nadolol or placebo. The test medication was started on the first postoperative morning and maintained as a single daily dose for 6 weeks. Aside from routine daily clinical evaluation and postoperative electrocardiographic monitoring, patients underwent 24-hour Holter recording once preoperatively and 3 times postoperatively. Seven patients were excluded from the evaluation of efficacy analysis because of insufficient postoperative data. There were no significant differences between the patients receiving nadolol (n = 67) and those receiving placebo (n = 74) with respect to age, preoperative heart rate, previous medications (including beta blockers), incidence of previous myocardial infarction, frequency of preoperative ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, concomitant valvular heart disease, mean cardiopulmonary bypass time, mean aortic cross-clamp time, use of blood and crystalloid cardioplegia, mean number of bypass grafts placed, postoperative use of inotropic agents and catecholamines and incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction. Analysis of postoperative Holter recordings showed that the heart rate was consistently and significantly higher in the placebo group throughout the period of the study (p less than 0.001). The average number of premature atrial contractions was significantly smaller in the nadolol group (p less than 0.05), and nadolol patients had fewer ventricular premature complexes, couplets and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias during the first week postoperatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with 23,008 white persons, larger percentages of black men and women were current smokers and reported a history of systemic hypertension. Despite the presence of chest pain, larger percentages of blacks had normal coronary arteries by angiography than did whites. The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted survival rate was 88% for whites and 82% for blacks (p less than 0.0001). Cox analysis indicated that black race was related to poorer survival in the medical group (p = 0.0006) but not in the surgical group (p = 0.28). For blacks, surgical therapy was related to a better survival rate (p = 0.009). These results raise questions concerning the effects of excess cigarette smoking and systemic hypertension and the role of coronary artery bypass surgery on survival of black persons.\r"

In three cases, frozen tissue for monoclonal antibodies and glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue for electron microscopic examination were available. Two of these showed B-cell phenotypes with monoclonal antibody studies. Electron microscopic examination on these two B-cell lymphomas showed scant cytoplasm and a paucity of cytoplasmic organelles. The third case did not show definite B- or T-cell surface markers but did show strong Leu-M1 and OKM1 staining. Electron microscopic examination of the tumor cells showed a prominent Golgi apparatus, abundant cytoplasm with numerous cytoplasmic organelles and phagolysosomes. However, DNA hybridization studies on this tumor showed immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene rearrangements typical of a B-cell lymphoma. All six lymphomas were solitary liver masses without evidence of disease elsewhere. The mean age for the six patients was 56.2 years (four males, two females).\r"

Abnormal bands were detected in the serum of six men, as single paraproteins in four and as oligoclonal bands in two. All six were seropositive for anti-HIV; one has LAS, two had persistent but minor lymphadenopathy, and three were apparently normal. There was no significant difference between the T-cell subsets or ratios between those seropositive men with or without paraproteins. This high incidence of paraproteins is another accompaniment of B-cell hyperactivation in persons infected with HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Of 175 recent Minnesota Hemophilus influenzae type b isolates from systemic disease, 43 were found to be resistant to ampicillin (greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/mL [mg/L]), each of which produced beta-lactamase. Of the 132 ampicillin-susceptible isolates, 68 (52%), all beta-lactamase negative, had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of either 1 or 2 micrograms/mL (mg/L), indicating relative resistance if derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections. From a review of the literature, and in agreement with the authors findings, ampicillin-resistant beta-lactamase-negative isolates are rare and are likely to be nontypeable, of respiratory origin, and with MICs in the low resistance range. For the 43 ampicillin-resistant isolates, percentages resistant to other agents were as follows: 0% chloramphenicol, 0% rifampin, 6% tetracycline, 0% trimeprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2% cefamandole, 5% cefaclor, 2% moxalactam, and 0% for the remaining third-generation cephalosporins cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime. Unlike ampicillin-resistant isolates, 100% of ampicillin-susceptible isolates had relatively low cefaclor MICs of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/mL (mg/L), suggesting a relatively increased H. influenzae beta-lactamase effect on cefaclor in comparison with the other cephalosporins tested.\r"

  ".W": "During a four-year surveillance period in a tertiary care children's hospital, nine children experienced 11 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae non-type b invasive infections, representing 9% of all invasive H influenzae infections. Of these nine children, two had lymphoproliferative disorders; one had immunoglobulin subclass deficiency; one had severe congenital heart disease, with chronic heart failure; two had cerebrospinal fluid leaks; and two were premature neonates whose mothers had prolonged rupture of amniotic membranes. Only one child had no evidence of an underlying condition that might predispose him to infection with these ordinarily nonpathogenic organisms. Three of the isolates were serotype f, one was serotype e, and the remaining seven were nontypable, with types a through f antisera. Thus, the majority of children experiencing invasive H influenzae non-type b infections appear to have a predisposing medical condition. To aid in detecting these unusual infections, all H influenzae isolates from otherwise sterile body sites should be serotyped, and those children with non-type b isolates should be evaluated for a possible predisposing underlying illness.\r"

To examine events underlying the formation and spread of these polymorphisms within a tandem array, we have cloned and sequenced a representative copy of a polymorphic array from the X chromosome and compared this polymorphic copy with the predominant higher-order repeat form of X-linked alpha satellite. Sequence data indicate that the polymorphism arose by a single base mutation that created a new restriction site (for HindIII) in the sequence of the predominant repeat unit. This variant repeat unit, marked by the new HindIII site, was subsequently amplified in copy number to create a polymorphic domain consisting of approximately 500 copies of the variant repeat unit within the X-linked array of alpha satellite. We propose that a series of intrachromosomal recombination events between misaligned tandem arrays, involving multiple rounds of either unequal crossing-over or sequence conversion, facilitated the spread and fixation of this variant HindIII repeat unit.\r"

Image analysis disclosed that the cross-sectional size of the large stromal amyloid deposits was significantly greater than those in age-matched patients with lattice corneal dystrophy type I. All patients had a discontinuous band of amyloid (15 to 25 micron wide) in the superficial stroma beneath Bowman's layer, which usually had only one or two small disruptions. Descemet's membrane and the endothelium were normal. The stromal deposits, which were composed of 10-nm diameter fibrils typical of amyloid, stained positively with Congo red after the histologic sections were pretreated with dilute potassium permanganate. Immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue indicated that only some deposits reacted weakly with antibodies to amyloid protein AA. The deposits stained positively with antibodies to protein AP and negatively with antibodies to kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains.\r"

Allogeneic C3H/He primary neuronal cultures were quickly destroyed after CTL addition, while syngeneic C57BL/6J neurons were not lysed. Alterations in the distribution of chromatin were the first ultrastructural changes that occurred, followed by loss of nuclear morphology, cytosolic changes, and eventually fragmentation of both the nucleus and cytosol. With Campenot chambers, it was possible to separate the membrane and nuclear lesions. CTLs exposed to neurites, but separated from the cell body by the chamber barrier, caused degeneration of neurites but did not cause lysis and cell death. Neuronal lysis mediated by antibody and complement appeared to be distinct from CTL-mediated lysis. These experiments demonstrate that neurons in culture are targets for MHC-specific CTLs, and therefore probably express functional levels of Class I antigens. The signal for killing by CTLs is not retrogradely transported from the neurite to the cell body, and morphologic events following CTL-neuron interaction resemble those that occur in dividing tumor target cell populations.\r"

Most BALB/c and all DBA/2 mice developed acute cardiac inflammation lasting only 2 weeks, while A animals consistently showed twice as much myocardial damage as the other two strains, with active myocarditis continuing for 56 days after virus inoculation. Although virus elimination from the heart was also delayed in A mice, immunopathogenic, not viral, mechanisms caused cardiac injury in all strains. In vivo depletion of L3T4+ (T helper) and Lyt 2+ (T cytolytic/suppressor) cells using monoclonal antibodies showed that myocarditis in BALB/c mice depended predominantly on Lyt 2+ cells, in DBA/2 mice on L3T4+ cells and in A mice on both Lyt 2+ and L3T4+ cells. IgM heart reactive antibodies (HRAs) occurred in all three strains, while IgG HRAs were detected only in DBA/2 and A mice. Presumably, only the IgG antibody was pathogenic in this system. These data suggest that the host's genetic makeup determines the type of immune response to CVB3 infection of the heart and therefore the pattern of myocarditis which develops.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol contributes more than 10 per cent of the total caloric intake of adult drinkers in the United States. However, the effect of alcohol on body weight has not been adequately studied in the general population. The association between weight and frequency of alcohol consumption was examined in two national cross-sectional surveys: the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HANESII; n = 10,929) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveys (BRFS; n = 18,388). Linear multiple regression was used to estimate the independent effect of alcohol on weight, adjusting for smoking, age, diet practices, physical activity, race, education, and height. Among men, alcohol had only a slight effect on weight in either survey. However, among women, alcohol was associated with a substantial reduction in weight, which was as large as the effect of smoking. Compared with nondrinkers, women who consumed alcohol 7-13 times per week had the greatest reduction in weight: -3.6 kg (95% confidence limits [CL] = -5.6, -1.5 kg) in HANESII and -3.2 kg (95% CL = -4.9, -1.5 kg) in BRFS. Alcohol confounded the association between smoking and weight, and among women it accounted for nearly 45 per cent of the weight-lowering effect of smoking. Alcohol also diminished the weight-lowering effect of smoking in men, while in women the smoking effect was slightly enhanced. Further studies are needed to understand the causal mechanisms by which alcohol is associated with body weight.\r"

A standard anaesthetic technique was supplemented either by one of two different doses of fentanyl, or by halothane. Eleven proteins were studied but the acute phase response was significantly altered by the anaesthetic technique for only two, fibrinogen and antichymotrypsin. The concentration of these proteins tended to be lower with 2-3 micrograms/kg fentanyl than with either halothane or fentanyl 12 micrograms/kg. There was no evidence of variation in stress suppression between the three techniques. The mechanism of any anaesthetic influence on the acute phase response is uncertain and this study is too small to assess its clinical significance.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with tuberculous pleural effusions may show cutaneous anergy to tuberculin purified-protein derivative (PPD). This phenomenon has been attributed either to preferential sequestration of antigen-specific T-lymphocytes to the pleural space or to the presence of suppressor monocytes in the blood. In 2 patients with primary tuberculous infection involving the pleura and with skin anergy to PPD, the in vitro proliferation of pleural and peripheral blood T-cells to PPD was evaluated. Although peripheral blood T-cells were not reactive, pleural T-cells showed a marked proliferative response to PPD. At least in the first patient, the lack of proliferation of circulating T-cells could not be related to the presence of suppressor monocytes. Interestingly, after 4 to 8 wk of specific chemotherapy, PPD skin test became positive and the blood T-lymphocytes responded in vitro to the same antigen. Pleural T-lymphocytes were used to generate long-term, PPD-specific T-cell lines and could be maintained in vitro for more than 3 months with repeated cycles of stimulation. The pleural and the blood T-lymphocytes and the T-cell lines were also characterized phenotypically: although the majority of the T-lymphocytes present in the pleural space after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection were Leu-3-positive (helper T-cells), T-cell lines proliferating in response to PPD included high numbers of Leu-2-positive cells (suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells). These data suggest that early skin anergy in tuberculous pleurisy may be associated with sequestration of PPD-reactive T-lymphocytes in the pleural spaces involving both Leu-2-and Leu-3-positive T-cells.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness has been suggested to be a useful test in identifying subjects with asthma in epidemiologic groups. We explored the association between the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and various definitions of asthma based upon information obtained from a questionnaire. We determined bronchial hyperresponsiveness by methacholine inhalation test, administered a standardized respiratory questionnaire, and performed spirometry on 1,392 male workers in various industries: 229 (16.5%) had PC20 less than 8 mg/ml, 66 (4.7%) had PC20 less than 2 mg/ml, and 8 (0.6%) had PC20 less than 0.5 mg/ml. Only 760 workers had no respiratory symptoms; no workers with PC20 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/ml, 31.0% of workers with PC20 greater than 0.5 but less than or equal to 2 mg/ml, and 38.0% of workers with PC20 greater than 2 but less than or equal to 8 mg/ml had no chest symptoms. Those reporting wheeze or breathlessness, and especially those with both symptoms, were significantly more likely to have bronchial hyperresponsiveness with a low PC20. The reporting of chest tightness did not influence this relationship, and there was no difference between the occurrence of \"wheeze without a cold\" and \"persistent wheeze.\" Although there was a stronger association of PC20 less than or equal to 2 mg/ml with asthma than with chronic bronchitis, the association of PC20 greater than 2 and less than or equal to 8 mg/ml was not different with asthma than with chronic bronchitis. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was more closely associated with asthma than with any asthmalike symptoms ascertained by a questionnaire developed for the study of chronic bronchitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87324468\r", 
  ".W": "Nitrogen dioxide is one form of an oxidizing free radical that is sufficiently stable to exist in relatively high concentrations in ambient air and cigarette smoke. We examined the effect of NO2 exposure on the functional activity against pancreatic elastase of alpha-1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1PI) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of nonsmoking subjects. Ten nonsmokers (mean age, 25 +/- 2 SE yr) were exposed to NO2 (3 or 4 ppm) for 3 h with intermittent exercise. Seven nonsmokers (mean age, 24 +/- 2 SE yr) underwent a similar protocol but were exposed to NO2-free air and served as control subjects. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 3.5 to 4 h after the end of exposure. Exposure to NO2 caused a 45% decrease in functional activity of alpha 1PI in BAL. There was no significant difference in immunoreactive alpha 1PI between the groups whether expressed as micrograms per 100 ml of recovered fluid or per milligram of albumin. This inactivation of alpha 1PI was not associated with any neutrophil migration into the air spaces of the lung. The \"elastaselike\" activity of BAL using synthetic elastinlike chromophore substrate succinyl-trialanine-nitroanilide showed no significant difference between the NO2-exposed group (221 +/- 39 SE ng/dl BAL) and the control group (196 +/- 61 SE ng/dl BAL). Assay for human leukocyte elastase (HLE) in concentrated BAL using the synthetic substrate Methoxysuc-Ala3-Pro-Val-aminomethylcoumarin did not detect any HLE activity in the BAL. These results showed that nonsmoking subjects exposed to relatively low concentrations of NO2 for a short time have a significant inactivation of alpha 1PI in the lower respiratory tract fluid than did nonsmoking control subjects.\r"

Now, we have quantitated NMC progenitors and lineage-specific growth factors using a hemopoietic colony assay. Cell suspensions from excised collagenase-treated nasal polyps (n = 7) contained 3.8 +/- 1.1 granulocyte colony-forming cells per 10(6) cells plated, compared to less than or equal to 0.5 in human tonsil suspensions, less than or equal to 0.5 in nasal mucosal epithelial scrapings, and 33 +/- 8 in peripheral blood of patients with ragweed allergic rhinitis (p less than 0.01). The percentage of metachromatic cells in nasal-polyp-derived colonies was 47 +/- 10 compared with 3.0 +/- 0.7 in peripheral blood colonies (p less than 0.005). Highly potent metachromatic cell colony-stimulating activity (CSA) was detected in supernatants from cultured human nasal epithelial scrapings from both polyps and atopic nasal mucosa, but not from nonatopic nasal mucosa. Supernatants from polyp mononuclear cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin also contained metachromatic cell-CSA, which had an approximate molecular size of 25 to 70,000 daltons on column chromatography. An IL-3-like activity was also detected in these supernatants. These observations provide further evidence for in situ hemopoietic mechanisms in human nasal mucosa, involving epithelium-derived stimulation of local metachromatic cell progenitor growth and differentiation in allergic rhinitis.\r"

More than 30% of the seropositive participants had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, independent of T-helper lymphocyte (CD4) counts and most other signs and symptoms. Other clinical manifestations such as thrush, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever, and fatigue occurred with only slightly reduced CD4 counts (400 to 700/mm3) and appeared to increase exponentially with progressively lower counts. A simple systematically derived clinical index using these manifestations identified more than 70% of the seropositive men with significant T-helper cell depletion. This kind of clinical index may be useful for assessing groups of HIV-infected persons, especially those whose T-lymphocyte numbers and function cannot be readily measured.\r"

Patients: Of 22 men with mild P. carinii pneumonia (PO2 greater than or equal to 55 mm Hg), 15 (9 in the inhaled group and 6 in the intravenous group) received treatment for their first episode and 7 for a repeat episode. Interventions: Pentamidine isethionate, 4 mg/kg body weight by inhalation, or 3 mg/kg intravenously, was given once daily, as long as clinically indicated. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 13 patients in the inhaled group, 9 has a satisfactory response; and of the 10 in the reduced-dose intravenous group, 9 had a satisfactory response. Major adverse reactions occurred in two patients in each group. Three patients in the inhaled group appeared to have had early relapses. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of pentamidine ranged between 16.8 +/- 7.3 ng/mL and 149.7 +/- 38.2 ng/mL in the inhaled group and 3.4 +/- 0.2 ng/mL and 10.9 ng/mL in the intravenous group. Conclusions: Inhaled or reduced-dose intravenous pentamidine may be an effective and less toxic therapy for mild P. carinii pneumonia. These regimens are not recommended for general use until larger controlled trials are conducted.\r"

In this study, inbred strains of mice were selected on the basis of varying resistance to mortality following lip inoculation with virus. A spectrum of CNS pathology was observed, ranging from focal collections of inflammatory cells at the trigeminal root entry zone in resistant strains (C57BL/6J), to unifocal demyelinating lesions in moderately resistant strains (BALB/cByJ), to multifocal demyelinating lesions throughout the brain in susceptible strains (A/J). Findings from viral titration studies of the CNS support a direct cytolytic effect of virus in the development of demyelinating lesions at the trigeminal root entry zone but cannot exclude an immune-mediated component. Furthermore, 50% tissue-culture-infective doses, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies of primary cultures of oligodendrocytes, derived from the three strains of adult mice, identify differences in resistance to HSV 1 infection in vitro, suggesting that differences at this level may also contribute to the pathological appearance. Multifocal lesions in A/J mice were first observed when the infectious virus could no longer be isolated from the CNS and may be the result of an immune-mediated process \"triggered\" by the acute CNS infection in susceptible strains of mice.\r"

In MS patients being treated with anti-T11, a murine monoclonal antibody which recognizes the sheep red blood cell receptor, it was found that peripheral blood T cells were labeled in vivo by the antibody. Furthermore, anti-T11 did not lyse cells or enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In CSF specimens obtained by serial lumbar punctures from patients with progressive MS who received five daily infusions of anti-T11, 70 +/- 12% of the T cells had mouse antibody bound to their surface by 72 to 96 hours. No in vivo staining of CSF T cells was observed in patients infused with anti-T4, a murine monoclonal antibody that was not found to label T cells in vivo. These results demonstrate that there is rapid movement of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood to the CNS in patients with progressive MS. This rapid trafficking of T cells suggests that the ongoing pathological process within the CNS may be closely linked to the peripheral immune system and may have implications for the monitoring and treatment of MS.\r"

  ".W": "Discrepancies were observed between results of different beta-lactamase induction tests with amdinocillin, which appeared to be a strong inducer in whole-cell assays but a weak inducer in assays with cell-free sonic extracts. Results of a nitrocephin-disk test with constitutive beta-lactamase producers indicated that the positive results obtained in whole-cell assays were due to drug-produced leakage of enzyme from the cell and not to induction. Imipenem was also found to cause leakage of beta-lactamase from a similar number of constitutive enzyme producers, while cefoxitin was much less likely to cause leakage. A split-dose regimen was employed to treat mice infected with a strain of Enterobacter cloacae which appeared to leak enzyme on exposure to amdinocillin. Results indicated that prior treatment with amdinocillin significantly enhanced (P less than 0.025) the efficacy of azlocillin, an enzyme-labile drug, but did not affect the efficacy of cefotaxime, a relatively enzyme-stable drug. Conversely, prior treatment with amdinocillin did not potentiate the efficacy of either azlocillin or cefotaxime in the treatment of mice infected with an Escherichia coli strain that was highly susceptible to all three drugs. Thus, it appears that amdinocillin may potentiate the activity of other beta-lactam drugs not only by binding to a complementary penicillin-binding protein but also by causing leakage of beta-lactamase from the cell. This effect may be related to its ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein 2 and subsequently produce changes in outer membrane permeability.\r"

Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.\r"

The effect of three different methods for inoculum preparation on the susceptibility of H. influenzae was also determined. The MICs were independent of the method of inoculum preparation, but the zone sizes were smaller if the inoculum was carefully adjusted to contain approximately 10(8) CFU/ml. MICs were higher and zone sizes were smaller when MHA + HGB was used instead of MHA + LYHB. Good correlation was found when MHA + LYHB was used for determining the MIC and MHA + HGB was used for determining susceptibility by the disk method. When the inoculum was adjusted to match a McFarland 0.5 standard, the viable counts had to be approximately 10(8) CFU/ml for good correlation between MICs and zone sizes. A-56268, a new macrolide antibiotic, was tested against H. influenzae, and its MICs and tentative breakpoints against this organism were determined. The MICs obtained by various methods were correlated with in vivo efficacy by using a mouse septicemia model. MICs obtained on MHA + HGB or MHA + LYHB incubated without a 5% CO2 atmosphere showed the best correlation with in vivo efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Ganciclovir is a nucleoside analog which inhibits the replication of herpesviruses in vitro and which has been effective by intravenous administration for the treatment of severe cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompromised patients. Because most patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and severe cytomegalovirus infection have required lifelong daily suppressive ganciclovir therapy to control disease progression, oral therapy appears to have practical advantages. We studied the pharmacokinetics of orally administered ganciclovir in four patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Repeated oral ganciclovir doses (10 to 20 mg/kg every 6 h) were well tolerated. With a 20-mg/kg dose given every 6 h, mean steady-state peak and trough levels were 2.96 and 1.05 microM, respectively, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h was 47 microM X h. Calculated absorption was 3.0%, based on urinary excretion. Because the levels achieved in serum with oral ganciclovir approximated those required to inhibit cytomegalovirus in vitro, a trial of oral maintenance therapy in immunocompromised patients with severe cytomegalovirus infections seems warranted.\r"

However, in the total set of patients, only the correlation of HLA-DR5 with progressive systemic scleroderma reached significance. Patients suffering from the CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophagus, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome showed an increase of HLA-DR1. Patients with inflammatory signs of the scleroderma showed an accumulation of HLA-DR2. Several HLA-linked genes control the susceptibility to scleroderma.\r"

Taking the incidence of SID in conjunction with rates of infant vaccination in the United Kingdom, nine infants would be expected to die, each year by chance alone, suddenly within 24 hours of (and within each 24 hour period succeeding) vaccination with DTP. Twins are at a greater risk of SID than single born infants and occasionally are found dead together. A number of studies into DTP vaccination as a risk factor in SID have shown that SID is less common in vaccinated than in unvaccinated infants.\r"

In Group 1, analysis of each subset-to-total lymphocyte ratio revealed that observed lymphocytopenia in the early postoperative days was mainly the result of T cell reduction, and that the decrease of helper/inducer T cells contributed to this decrease. In contrast, no significant fluctuation of any lymphocyte subpopulation ratio was observed in Group 2. Analysis of lymphocyte subpopulation ratios in lymphoid organs showed that reciprocal changes of T cells and their subsets were observed in the bone marrow, thus indicating that the redistribution of T cells (especially of helper/inducer cells) seems to occur between peripheral blood and bone marrow in Group 1. Furthermore, there was no relationship between serum cortisol levels and the changes in lymphocyte subset ratios in Group 1 patients.\r"

Relative rates and morphologies of sealant resorption and other histological findings were predicted by a previous study involving subcutaneous implantation of the same graft materials in the rat. In particular, both studies revealed that delayed resorption of collagen cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and collagen cross-linked with formaldehyde resulted in lack of adhesion between inner capsule and conduit, thereby causing focal hemorrhagic dissection in the circulatory implants. There were no important qualitative or quantitative differences in healing between sheep and dogs or in pulmonary versus systemic location of the conduit. Rendering an animal cyanotic by placing a pulmonary arterial-left atrial shunt or by increasing or decreasing the intraconduit systolic pressure did not obviously affect healing. The results emphasize that the biological consequences of sealed grafts are strongly dependent on the sealant material. Porosity control of knitted Dacron with biological sealants that undergo minimal or delayed resorption may lead to poor tissue adhesion and resultant complications.\r"

After adjusting for age, use of steroids, drug or alcohol abuse, and recent trauma, the odds ratio for Mexican American women compared with non-Hispanic whites was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.95), indicating a substantially lower risk. These results are concordant with earlier data documenting a reduced risk of hip fracture among Mexican American women. Thus, recommendations for prophylactic treatments for osteoporosis may be different for Mexican Americans than for non-Hispanic whites.\r"

We examined 30 patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis for CTS and performed abdominal fat tissue aspiration for amyloid staining to evaluate the presence of systemic amyloid disease. In this group, CTS was frequent (37%) and its prevalence correlated with the duration of hemodialysis. In all patients, the abdominal fat tissue, stained with Congo red, was negative for amyloid deposits. These results confirm that CTS is a frequent complication of long-term hemodialysis; however, in this study, no detectable amyloid deposits were found in abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue. Thus, abdominal fat aspiration may not be a reliable screening test for hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis.\r"

Non-Hispanic whites had higher rates of drug abuse/dependence than Mexican Americans; the rates among non-Hispanic whites in Los Angeles were also higher than those found at other ECA sites. Mexican Americans displayed higher rates of severe cognitive impairment, a finding that likely reflects ethnic and educational bias in the measurement of cognitive impairment.

Young non-Hispanic white women reported high rates of major depressive episodes and drug abuse/dependence. Alcohol abuse/dependence is highly prevalent among Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white men of any age. Mexican-American women infrequently abuse or become dependent on drugs or alcohol at any age. Dysthymia, panic disorder, and phobia are somewhat more prevalent among Mexican-American women over 40 years of age compared with both non-Hispanic white women over and Mexican-American women under 40 years of age.

Comparisons of laypersons' DIS results with psychiatrists' clinical diagnoses yielded generally poorer agreement. Levels of agreement improved when diagnoses were clustered into higher-rank categories. These results raise cultural issues related to the use of the DIS in Puerto Rico.\r"

In a logistic regression analysis that controlled for potential confounders, including age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and the DIS-DSM-III diagnoses of major depression and antisocial personality disorder, the elevated odds of alcohol abuse or dependence in the rural area remained significant for the interactive variable \"rural blacks\" (relative risk, 2.88). Factors leading to urban-rural differences in psychiatric disorders, such as current alcohol abuse or dependence, are therefore more complex than can be explained by geographic boundaries alone.\r"

We examined pituitary and adrenocortical responses after morning administration of ovine CRH (oCRH) in 26 depressed patients and 11 healthy volunteers. Basal plasma ACTH concentrations were similar in both groups, whereas patients had a significantly diminished cumulative ACTH response after administration of oCRH. In contrast, basal total cortisol concentrations and cumulative cortisol responses to oCRH were similar in depressed patients and controls. Patients with melancholic features demonstrated the most profound ACTH blunting after oCRH, whereas patients separated according to dexamethasone suppression test results had similar ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH. The present results extend data from prior studies utilizing oCRH in the evening and demonstrate a dysregulation of the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in depressive illness after a morning oCRH test at both central and peripheral hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis sites.\r"

Among children 4 to 16 years of age, the overall six-month prevalence rate of one or more of these disorders was 18.1%. The prevalences of hyperactivity and one or more disorders were significantly higher in urban areas than rural areas. The utilization data indicated that children with these psychiatric disorders, compared with children without these disorders, were almost four times more likely to have received mental health or social services in the six months preceding this study. However, five of six of these children had not received these specialized services in the previous six-month period. Over 50% of the children in the province had received ambulatory medical care in the last six months. Over 15% of the children in the province had received special education services at some time thus far in their school careers. Implications of these findings, especially for the provision of child mental health services, are discussed.\r"

An attempt has been made to summarize our present knowledge on immune functions that are vulnerable to aging. It revealed that at the cellular level, all four antigen-responsive immune cells (T cells, B cells, monocytes, and killer cells) are vulnerable to aging, but T cells are perhaps the most vulnerable. Therefore, this article specifically examines the cellular and biochemical T cell-dependent concomitants of age-altered immune functions. One picture that is emerging suggests that at the molecular level, several control points exist along the path of gene expression that could be vulnerable to aging.\r"

Average step length and gait velocity, ground reaction forces and their distribution under both feet, and crutch loading were measured; goniograms of joint angles, kinesiologic gait analysis, and EMG recordings from the main muscles used in ambulation and in standing, were made while patients in both groups walked without stimulation. Quantitative measurements before, during, at the end, and 8.4 months posttherapy were taken based on at least 40 strides per patient. The results for the stimulated group in midtherapy indicated faster recovery rates (3.15 times in step length and 2.25 times in gait velocity) than in the control group, and at the end of therapy the stimulated group had higher improvement levels (2.14 times in step length, 1.42 times in gait velocity, and 1.63 times in kinesiologic gait analysis). The differences between the two groups faded after 8.4 months without treatment, and some kinesiologic deficits reappeared, mostly those in the more distal muscle groups. These findings indicate a need for a simpler orthotic electric stimulation after multisite therapy in several cases. Immediate effects of the six-site stimulation were also considered for orthotic possibilities after the therapy.\r"

She was injured in an automobile accident, with cervical and lumbar muscle strain diagnosed by a local emergency room physician. She consulted a chiropractor two days later because her symptoms had not abated. The chiropractic treatment of short-wave diathermy, high-voltage electric stimulation and spinal manipulation continued thrice weekly for six weeks. She then presented to her neurologist, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, increased diplopia, cervical and occipital pain, and disrupted sleep. Neck weakness had developed since her last visit. She was admitted to the hospital for evaluation. Neurologic exam showed no other abnormality of strength, sensation, or reflexes. The exacerbation of myasthenia responded to prednisone and increased pyridostigmine. After two months she required only her preinjury dose of pyridostigmine (60 mg q.d. p.r.n.) to prevent diplopia or fatigue, and her strength was normal. Repeated electrically induced muscle contraction is suspected of causing this exacerbation of myasthenia gravis.\r"

To our knowledge, however, there are no studies evaluating whether transfusions result in increased rates of infections. To investigate this, 295 Lewis rats were subjected to a 25% total body surface area burn and were given either 3 mL of Lewis blood, 3 mL of A'Solagoft Cancer Institute rat blood, or 9 mL of lactated Ringers' solution intravenously on day 1 before burn or on the day of burn. One additional group received 1-mL transfusions on days 9, 7, and 5 before burn. The burns were painted with 1 X 10(8) Pseudomonas aeruginosa lot No. 1244 on postburn days 0, 1, or 2. All rats were followed up for 28 days and survival and mean survival times were recorded. Transfusion of A'Solagoft Cancer Institute blood increased mortality unless given within 24 hours prior to Pseudomonas challenge, when it diminished mortality. Transfusion with syngenic Lewis blood had no effect. We conclude that transfusions may adversely affect survival when given before bacterial challenge, possibly due to immunosuppression from exposure to non-self-histocompatibility antigens.\r"

We have applied the modern molecular techniques of analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms to three multigenerational kindreds in which BCM is segregating. Significant linkage is established to two DNA markers, DXS15 and DXS52, each of which maps to the vicinity of Xq28. Regional localization of the locus for BCM has the potential to improve carrier detection and to provide antenatal diagnosis in families at risk for the disease.\r"

Twelve and a half to 200 U of intravitreally injected rIl-1 consistently induced inflammation, which was documented using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, histologic methods, or direct quantitation of protein in the aqueous humor. Responses including a cellular infiltrate in the anterior chamber, protein extravasation, and iris vessel dilatation became evident within six hours, peaked at 24 hours, and began to recede by 48 to 72 hours after the injection. Pathologic changes primarily occurred in the anterior chamber and included edema, hemorrhage, and cellular infiltration. Locally injected corticosteroid reduced but did not prevent rIl-1-induced changes in vascular permeability. Heat-inactivated rIl-1 induced minimal changes, as determined by histologic methods, slit-lamp examination, or direct protein measurement. These data support the conclusion that Il-1 should be considered as a potential mediator of ocular inflammation.\r"

We conclude that complete capsulectomy may be required if inflammation persists after conventional treatment for endophthalmitis, which may include pars plana vitrectomy, partial capsulectomy, and antibiotic therapy. Sterile postoperative uveitis is a diagnosis of exclusion.

In vitro cultures of T and B cells were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen, and the secreted IgM-RF, tetanus antibody, and total IgM protein were measured by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In cultures containing unseparated T cells, IgM-RF production in the DR4+ and DR4- subgroups was not significantly different. However, depletion of OKT8+ cells containing T suppressor cells resulted in significantly higher IgM and IgM-RF synthesis in the DR4+ subgroup. Moreover, 6 of the 8 highest levels of IgM-RF were produced by DR4+ individuals, while only 7 of the remaining 27 individuals were DR4+ (P = 0.035). Ratios of secreted IgM-RF:IgM indicated that there was a relative enrichment for IgM-RF- specific B cell precursors in DR4+ high responders, although total numbers of circulating B cells were not increased. High responder B cells had high levels of responsiveness when mixed with T helper cells from low responders, whereas low responder B cells consistently produced low responses, even when cocultured with T helper cells from high responder donors. The data suggest that a subset of normal individuals has a pokeweed mitogen-responsive lymphocyte population that contains a B cell subpopulation specific for IgM-RF synthesis and that this condition is associated with HLA-DR4. In certain individuals who have the DR4 type, there may be a component of a susceptible genetic background, upon which other factors act to induce IgM-RF synthesis and which may produce clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Blood and synovial lymphocytes from 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 13 patients with other articular diseases, and 24 control subjects were exposed to these monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4:CD8 ratios were similar for the 3 groups. In RA patients, there was a depletion of SI cells in blood and synovial fluid, and the ratio of HI cells to SI cells was elevated, particularly in the synovial lymphocytes. These data provide new evidence for T cell dysregulation in the perpetuation of RA.\r"

  ".W": "The phenotypic frequencies of human major histocompatibility complex class I, II, and III antigens and immunoglobulin allotypes (Gm factors) were determined in 56 patients (55 women, 1 man) who had lupus-like disease induced by venopyronum dragees. The findings in these patients were compared with those of a control group. We found a significant increase of HLA-DR4 (57.1% versus 26.5%, relative risk [RR] 3.7) and a decrease of HLA-DR3 (3.6% versus 19.1%, RR 0.16) in the patient group. In addition, the haplotype Gm 1;21 (60.7% versus 32.9%, RR 3.2), and the phenotype Gm 1,3;5,21 (46.4% versus 25.8%, RR 2.5) were significantly increased. Both the haplotype Gm 1;21 and the phenotype Gm 1,3;5,21 are associated with HLA-DR4 in pseudolupus patients but not in controls. The coincidence of HLA-DR4 and Gm 1;21 markedly increases the risk of acquiring pseudolupus (RR 6.9). We conclude that the pathogenesis of pseudolupus is influenced by at least 2 independent genetic factors. A similar HLA association has been described in hydralazine-induced lupus, and this suggests a common pathogenic mechanism.\r"

In order to address questions regarding sites of synthesis and chromosomal localization of the Factor XIII a-chain, cDNA was cloned from a lambda gt11 human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were determined from the cDNA. Amino acid sequencing of purified platelet Factor XIII a-chains confirmed the authenticity of the lambda gt11 clone. The gene for Factor XIII a-chain was mapped uniquely to chromosome 6. Northern blot analysis of human placental and U937 (monocytelike) cell poly (A)+ mRNA showed a single approximately 4.0-kb message for the Factor XIII a-chain. These results provide conclusive evidence that the a-chain is synthesized by placenta and monocyte cell lines.\r"

The library was screened by using an affinity-purified rabbit antibody against NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of human erythrocytes. A cDNA about 1.3 kilobase pairs long was isolated. By using the cDNA as a probe, another cDNA (pb5R141) of 1817 base pairs was isolated that hybridized with a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding Pro-Asp-Ile-Lys-Tyr-Pro, derived from the amino acid sequence at the amino-terminal region of the enzyme from human erythrocytes. Furthermore, by using the pb5R141 as a probe, cDNA clones having more 5' sequence were isolated from a human placenta cDNA library. The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of these cDNA clones overlapped each other and consisted of a sequence that completely coincides with that of human erythrocytes and a sequence of 19 amino acid residues extended at the amino-terminal side. The latter sequence closely resembles that of the membrane-binding domain of steer liver microsomal enzyme.\r"

Birth weight, neonatal ponderal index, and midarm circumference to head circumference ratio were measured. A birth weight, ponderal index, or midarm circumference to head circumference ratio less than or equal to tenth or greater than or equal to ninetieth percentiles for gestational age was considered abnormal. Poor outcome was defined as operative delivery for fetal distress, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, meconium aspiration, polycythemia, or hypoglycemia. Thirty-three (9.3%) neonates had perinatal morbidity. Although morbidity was not increased among neonates that were large by any of the criteria, five (25%) of 20 with low birth weight had poor outcome and 18 (26%) of 70 with low ponderal index or midarm circumference to head circumference ratio suffered morbidity. Of the 33 neonates with morbidity, 18 (54.5%) had low ponderal index or midarm circumference to head circumference ratio, but only five (15.2%) had low birth weight. Therefore, low ponderal index and midarm circumference to head circumference ratio are more sensitive predictors of outcome than is birth weight. As such, ponderal index and midarm circumference to head circumference ratio are more appropriate end points for antenatal diagnostic studies than is birth weight.\r"

In 88 patients simultaneous laparoscopy was performed and one patient had a simultaneous laparotomy. Ninety procedures were performed on an outpatient basis with the patients under general anesthesia. The septum was incised with flexible scissors. Sequential estrogen-gestagen therapy was used immediately after operation to reepithelialize the freshly dissected surfaces. Patients were permitted to conceive in the first month after operation. The indications for hysteroscopy were multiple but included recurrent abortion in 79 patients. Among those patients in this category the pretreatment reproductive wastage was 95%. Most losses were in the first trimester. Among those patients who conceived after therapy, the gestational outcome markedly improved. Eighty-seven percent of the pregnancies have resulted in a living infant or have progressed beyond 20 weeks of gestation. Because the gestational outcome equals or exceeds that achieved by transabdominal metroplasty and because of its lower morbidity and the option for vaginal delivery, hysteroscopic incision of the symptomatic septate uterus should replace transabdominal metroplasty.\r"

Heart transplantation is the only viable long-term therapy for end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. In the case of sudden decompensation in a patient who requires cardiac transplantation, if a suitable allograft is not immediately available, a system of prosthetic ventricles can be used to provide hemodynamic support until a donor organ is located. In addition, the use of a prosthetic ventricle or ventricles does not preclude the possibility of recovery of ventricular function, an option that is removed if a total artificial heart is used.\r"

  ".W": "While certain critically ill patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation can be stabilized with either drugs, the intraaortic balloon pump, or a left ventricular assist device, other patients do not respond to these therapies and the use of a safe and effective artificial heart can be lifesaving. For this latter group, the pneumatic heart appears to be suitable, although minor improvements will be welcomed. The percutaneous tubes and bulky drive unit are not great disadvantages to the patient who uses an interim heart and remains in a constant care area. The patient with end-stage heart disease who cannot have a heart transplant has little hope at present. Interestingly, the pneumatic heart that is available now might be an acceptable alternative to death if the incidence of stroke could be overcome. In the future, these patients will be better served by either an electrically powered left ventricular assist pump or a totally artificial heart.\r"

The end-expiratory position of this part of the diaphragm was noted before and after induction. Craniad movement of this position was seen in 10 patients. In a further eight, the end-expiratory position did not change, and in two patients it moved caudally. The mean movement was 0.36 +/- 0.52 cm in a cranial direction, which was statistically significant (P less than 0.01) but was only 23% of the movement associated with quiet breathing. The extent or direction of movement was not related to the weight of the patient (expressed as a proportion of the expected weight). The findings do not support the hypothesis that the reduction of lung volume on induction of anaesthesia is caused solely by movement of the diaphragm.\r"

DNA hybridization of cervical scrapes was used to monitor the effect of interferon on the human papillomaviruses (HPV) associated with CIN. There was, however, no significant difference in the expression of HPV 6 or 16 in the cervical epithelium of patients treated with interferon compared with those given a placebo. By using superficial cells scraped from the surface of the cervical epithelium as a source of DNA for viral studies, we were able to investigate the relation between HPV and CIN without interfering with the natural history of the disease. HPV 16 was detected in lesions which persisted while HPV 6 only was detected in one lesion that regressed. Regression was clearly associated with reduction in the number of copies of viral DNA per cell in this case. Dual infection with HPV types 6 and 16 were recorded in two patients with persistent lesions. In one patient, hybridization studies indicated that infection with HPV 16 could have occurred after infection with type 6 was established, and it is postulated that this may have changed the nature of the cervical lesion.\r"

This solution was designed to restrict the loss of intracellular potassium and to prevent cell swelling at low temperatures. In one group the corneas were frozen and thawed surrounded by 5 ml of medium, while in the second group corneas were drained of excess fluid and frozen in air. The third group consisted of corneas cryopreserved by Capella and colleagues' method. All the cryopreserved corneas were damaged, but those that had been frozen in air after exposure to the new medium showed better structure and function than corneas frozen by either of the other two techniques.\r"

The plasma vWF of each individual lacked large multimers; each had a prolonged bleeding time; and both platelet and leukocyte counts were elevated. Plasma was obtained from blood drawn into 1 mmol/L leupeptin, 6 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide, and 5 mmol/L EDTA to prevent in vitro proteolysis. vWF was isolated from plasma by immunoadsorbent chromatography, reduced, subjected to SDS-5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with a mixture of 55 anti-vWF monoclonal antibodies. In three patients with essential thrombocytosis (ET) the 176 and 140 kDa fragments were increased in proportion to the intact 225 kDa subunit indicating increased proteolysis. Treatment of one ET patient with CCNU (Lomustine) decreased the platelet count and, to a lesser extent, the white blood cell count. This was associated with a correction of the bleeding time, a partial correction of the multimeric abnormality, and a lessening of vWF cleavage. In a patient with polycythemia rubra vera (PRV) the proportion of the 176 kDa fragment was increased to the upper limit of normal but there was no definite evidence of increased proteolysis. These studies provide evidence that proteolysis plays a role in the acquired von Willebrand's disease associated with the myeloproliferative syndrome. However, other mechanisms must also be considered.\r"

Eosinophil degranulation shown by MBP deposition outside of eosinophils was found in six of eight nodes from patients with nodular sclerosing disease and in two of eight nodes from patients with lymphocyte depletion-type disease. Three nodes of the mixed cellularity type, one node of the lymphocyte predominance type, and one lymph node of the lymphocyte depletion type showed one or two small foci of extracellular MBP deposition. Lymph nodes from patients without Hodgkin's disease showed no extracellular deposition of MBP. Large numbers of eosinophils were found in seven of eight nodes of the nodular sclerosing variant, but were less frequently seen among the other types of Hodgkin's disease. The presence of extracellular MBP in lymph nodes of patients with Hodgkin's disease indicates that eosinophil degranulation commonly occurs and suggests that the released eosinophil granule proteins may participate in the inflammatory reaction in this disorder more extensively than is presently appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper a microplate method is described for diagnosing acute leukemia and for investigating the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against membrane antigens in combination with rabbit or murine antibodies to nuclear terminal transferase (TdT). The speed of this method facilitates the investigation of fresh leukemic cells from individual patients and assesses the cytolytic efficacy of the relevant MoAbs in the presence of complement (C'). Lymphoblasts (TdT+) are mixed in equal proportions with known numbers of \"inert\" cells, eg, RBC or nonleukemic bone marrow (BM). Following incubation with MoAbs and C' the ratio of residual TdT+ cells and inert cells is determined on cytospin preparations. Initially, percentages of TdT+ cells are counted in a unit volume of 5,000 inert cells, followed by the scanning of greater than 2 X 10(4) inert cells on entire slides. With this method more than 4 log cytoreduction of TdT + cells is detected. The method is also applicable for studying the cytolysis of malignant B cells by using mostly monoclonal lg expression rather than TdT for the identification of residual B cells. Ten representative patients selected from a group of greater than 100 are reported. In some cases cytoreduction of greater than 4 log with no identifiable residual TdT + cells is achieved by a single C'-fixing MoAb: anti-CD10 (RFAL3) in common acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and anti-CD7 (RFT2) in T cell ALL (T-ALL). Other cases require cocktails of anti-CD10, anti-CD19, and anti-CD24 in common ALL or anti-CD7 and anti-CD8 in T-ALL. In T-ALL a few TdT + cells remain that exhibit the features of normal TdT + BM cells (CD7-, HLA-DR+). This is particularly noticeable when patients are studied in partial remission or if nonleukemic BM is used as a source of inert cells. The methods described here contribute to establishing a range of MoAbs (ie, of IgM class) and techniques for efficient purging and to comparing the efficacy of \"clean-up,\" in remission, of common ALL, T-ALL, and B cell malignancies.\r"

Biosynthesis of plasma FXIII has not previously been demonstrated. In the present study, direct evidence has been obtained that two human hepatoma cell lines, Hep G2 and PLC/PRF/5, synthesize and secrete FXIII B protein. Secretion of the B subunit of FXIII by Hep G2 was demonstrated by immunoblotting. De novo synthesis by Hep G2 was confirmed in 35S-methionine-labeled cultures. Radiolabeled conditioned medium was concentrated, mixed (1:1) with purified B protein, and examined by crossed immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum to the B subunit. The single protein precipitin arc of purified B protein comigrated with the radiolabeled FXIII from Hep G2 visualized by autoradiography, indicating both electrophoretic and antigenic identity. The data presented here represent the first demonstrations of biosynthesis of FXIII B protein by any cell type and suggest that the liver is the site of synthesis of FXIII B protein. Further analysis of concentrated Hep G2 serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) and cell lysate by immunoblotting following nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated the FXIII A protein as well as the B protein and also revealed synthesis and secretion of the A and B proteins by PLC/PRF/5. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis studies of Hep G2 SFCM and cell lysate suggest that Hep G2 cells also synthesize and secrete the plasma FXIII zymogen. With a specific radioimmunoassay for B protein, FXIII was found in Hep G2 SFCM at approximately 4 ng/mL; with an amplified rocket immunoelectrophoresis technique the level was approximately 5 ng/mL.\r"

We developed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that are cytotoxic to myeloid leukemia cells to treat bone marrow from these patients ex vivo for autologous transplantation. In this pilot study, bone marrow was harvested from ten patients with AML in remission, treated with one or two complement-fixing MoAbs, PM-81 and AML-2-23, which react with myeloid differentiation antigens, incubated with rabbit complement, and cryopreserved. These MoAbs were chosen because they have broad reactivity with AML cells but not with pluripotent progenitor cells. At the time of transplant, 6 patients were in second complete remission, 1 each was in third complete or partial remission, and 2 were in early first relapse. The patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg a day for 2 days) and total body irradiation (200 cGy twice a day for 3 days) and given infusions of MoAb-treated bone marrow. Full bone marrow reconstitution was observed in eight patients; two patients did not recover platelets. Seven of the ten patients are surviving and disease-free at 21.0, 15.0, 13.0, 10.0, 6.0, 3.0, and 2.0 months posttransplant. Treating bone marrow with MoAbs to myeloid differentiation antigens does not interfere with pluripotential stem cell engraftment. Longer follow-up and a controlled study are necessary to prove that the apparent efficacy of this therapeutic approach in some patients is attributable to MoAb-mediated killing of leukemia cells.\r"

  ".W": "An electrophoretically pure preparation of natural human interleukin-1 (IL-1) was shown to stimulate in vitro colony formation in human bone marrow cultures. Day 4 myeloid cluster-forming cells (CFC), as well as early (day 7) and late (day 10) granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion. At optimal concentrations of IL-1, the number of day 4 CFC reached 72%, the number of day 7 CFU-GM reached 32%, and the number of day 10 CFU-GM reached 80% of the respective numbers of colonies obtained by addition of crude leukocyte-conditioned medium (LCM). The IL-1-induced stimulatory effect on CFU-GM growth could be completely neutralized by a rabbit anti-IL-1 antiserum. Colony growth was abrogated by depleting the marrow cell suspensions of phagocytic cells prior to IL-1 addition. Conversely, the effect could be reintroduced by addition of marrow-derived adherent cells to bone marrow cell suspensions that had been depleted of both phagocytic and E rosetting T cells. Furthermore, media conditioned by bone marrow-derived adherent cells or by peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes in the presence but not in the absence of IL-1, stimulated in vitro colony growth of phagocyte-depleted bone marrow cell suspensions. These results indicate that IL-1 induces release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) from human mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

  ".W": "We treated 14 patients by transplantation of marrow from unrelated volunteer donors. Eight patients had severe aplastic anemia, 3 had chronic granulocytic leukemia, and 3 had Fanconi's anemia. The results are compared with those of a group of 14 similar patients transplanted concurrently from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched family members: Sustained engraftment was achieved in 8 of 14 patients in both groups; one additional patient survived with autologous marrow reconstitution following an unrelated donor transplant. In the unrelated donor group, 6 of 9 evaluable patients developed grade III through IV acute graft-v-host disease, as compared with 4 of 9 patients after family-mismatched transplants. Overall survival was similar in the two groups. In the unrelated donor group 4 of 14 (29%) patients survived (median survival 1,299 days) as compared with 5 of 14 (36%) in the mismatched-family donor group (median survival 808 days). In both groups, patients with HLA phenotypically matched donors fared better than those with donors who were mismatched for one or more HLA antigen. Of the patients transplanted from HLA phenotypically matched donors 6 of 12 patients (50%) survived, as compared with 3 of 16 patients (19%) transplanted from HLA-mismatched donors. We conclude that unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) should be considered in those cases of leukemia or bone marrow failure in which the chance of cure using conventional therapy is remote and a HLA genotypically or phenotypically matched family donor is not available.\r"

  ".U": "87050054\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with severe aplastic anemia were conditioned with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and given marrow grafts from HLA-identical family members. Among 233 patients transplanted, 225 survived greater than or equal to 14 days and could be evaluated for engraftment. Forty-four of the 225 rejected their graft; 33 of these died and 11 survive. One hundred eighty-one patients had sustained engraftment; of these, 46 died and 135 survived. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed five risk factors for graft rejection: year of transplant, a large number of platelet transfusions, a positive relative response in mixed leukocyte culture, a low marrow cell dose, and omission of donor buffy coat cell infusion for transfused patients. These data show that patients transplanted recently had a lower likelihood of graft rejection than did patients transplanted in earlier years. Conceivably, this was related to changes in transfusion practices, but other factors as yet unidentified are likely to be involved. The data confirm that the largest possible number of marrow cells should be transplanted. Although the difference in the incidence of graft rejection between untransfused and transfused patients was not significant, it should be noted that transfused patients were given buffy coat cells. Because the addition of buffy coat cells results in a higher incidence of chronic graft-v-host disease (GVHD), it is still desirable to transplant patients with marrow alone early in their course before they have been transfused.\r"

Radiolabeled substance P binds rapidly to an apparently single class of noninteracting high affinity sites (Kd = 2.4 nmol/L; Bmax = 9.4 fmol/mg protein). The ligand selectivity pattern suggests that substance P binding sites are similar to substance P receptors found in other tissues, including the brain, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. Substance P receptors are highly concentrated in the antigen-trapping spleen marginal zone, with low densities being found in the red pulp. No specific binding of radiolabel to T cell-dependent immunologic domains of the spleen is seen. The distribution of substance P receptors suggests that substance P is probably involved in the control of sensory functions of the immune system.\r"

Evolution of diagnosis has occurred gradually during the history of medicine. As we see it, computer-assisted data handling will have a profound effect on diagnosis and classification of disease. To meet this challenge we require to define our terms regarding diagnosis of rheumatic disorders. In this paper we comment on the state of the art of diagnosis and classification of rheumatic diseases, and then propose changes to meet the needs of future developments.\r"

Analysis of the results on an intention to treat basis showed no substantial differences in depression or anxiety among groups at one, three, or six months after the operation. At 13 months, however, patients who had been allocated chemotherapy had significantly more symptoms, especially depression, than control patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Conditioned reflex nausea and vomiting increased considerably during the second six months of chemotherapy and persisted for up to a year afterwards. The psychological morbidity of adjuvant chemotherapy could be substantially reduced if courses of treatment were restricted to about six months.\r"

Tumor grade was determined on histologic review of primary tumor sections by two central review pathologists using a modification of the Bloom and Richardson grading system. The 5-year overall survival rates (+/- SE) were: Grade 1, 86% +/- 2; Grade 2, 70% +/- 2; and Grade 3, 57% +/- 2 (P less than 0.0001). This survival difference was seen in both premenopausal (P less than 0.0001) and postmenopausal (P less than 0.0001) women. Significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) by tumor grade were also observed (P less than 0.0001). The tumor grade determined by the 75 contributing local clinic pathologists was also highly significant for predicting DFS and overall survival. Tumor grade remained a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (P less than 0.0001) and overall survival (P less than 0.0001) in multivariate analyses controlling for nodal status, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, menopausal status, age, peritumoral vessel invasion, and treatment assigned. In postmenopausal patients for whom adjuvant treatment was compared with no adjuvant therapy, the prognostic significance of tumor grade was modified by the effect of treatment. The presence of vessel invasion by primary tumor cells was a stronger predictor of early recurrence than was increasing tumor grade in postmenopausal patients who received no adjuvant therapy. The higher failure rates for patients with high-grade tumors was due to a larger number of failures in regional and visceral sites. Tumor grade can be determined by any pathologist and allows for selection of a subpopulation of breast cancer patients at high risk for early mortality.\r"

He received radiation therapy to the left hip for stabilization, then eight cycles of intense (COP-BLAM) chemotherapy. Restaging at the completion of therapy demonstrated a normal physical examination, laboratory values, bone scan, bone survey, and abdominal computerized tomographic scan. One month after restaging he developed rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of an axillary node showed complete fatty replacement without lymphoma, and the patient remains in remission 16 months later. Recent reports of residual masses after lymphoma therapy have demonstrated fibrous replacement, necrotic tissue, thymic hyperplasia, and vascular anomalies mimicking lymphadenopathy. Lymph node enlargement may be due to nonmalignant causes, including fatty replacement, and not due to recurrent lymphoma.\r"

Oxygen selectively vasodilates the pulmonary vascular bed, increases oxygen delivery and mixed venous oxygen tension, and reduces the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular work. Clinically, oxygen therapy improves neurologic function, exercise performance, and survival. Digitalis therapy is indicated only in patients with biventricular failure or supraventricular tachycardia. Diuretics should be used carefully. Two investigational therapies offer promise, but are unproven. Almitrine increases arterial PO2, and vasodilators lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Despite the proper use of the drugs reviewed in this chapter, the current therapy for the treatment of right ventricular hypertrophy and failure is limited. Improved therapy will require a better understanding of the pathophysiology that causes a hypertrophied ventricle to fail.\r"

Increases in right ventricular after-load will occur as the result of a number of mechanisms, many of which are present in the face of altered pulmonary physiology. To assess the role of pulmonary disease in the development of chronic right failure, one needs a knowledge of the physiologic effects of the respiratory process in each individual. Is the physiologic profile appropriate to be associated with cor pulmonale? Advances in understanding control of breathing, sleep-disordered breathing, and exercise contribute to clarifying the clinical picture of many patients with chronic right heart failure. In these patients, changes in afterload continue to be the central predominant problem.\r"

  ".W": "When shock complicates an acute increase in RV afterload, initial therapy should be directed toward restoration of an adequate BP (RV coronary perfusion pressure) and CO. Current results indicate that norepinephrine, a drug with direct inotropic and pressor effects, may be an excellent agent for acute resuscitation and short-term maintenance of hemodynamic stability when frank circulatory instability complicates pulmonary embolism. Following hemodynamic stabilization, thrombolytic therapy should be initiated. Recent evidence suggests that the lytic agent can be given by bolus technique, but more work is required to determine the optimum dosing regimen. In the absence of shock, when a moderate decrease in CO complicates pulmonary embolism, isoproterenol or hydralazine may be used to improve flow. However, both of these agents may decrease systemic vascular resistance and BP. Accordingly, the latter parameter should be carefully monitored to ensure that excessive falls in BP and RV coronary perfusion pressure do not occur. Whereas in certain conditions volume expansion is appropriate therapy to increase CO, in acute pulmonary hypertension with excessive RV afterload, volume expansion may worsen RV function. Recent canine studies indicate that an increase in vascular closing pressure is the predominant mechanism explaining the increase in PAP and apparent increase in PVR complicating pulmonary embolism. Accordingly, in addition to decreasing vascular resistance, therapy to decrease RV afterload could be directed toward decreasing the vascular response producing excessive closing pressures.\r"

  ".U": "87051565\r", 
  ".W": "Of multiple etiologies for pure tricuspid regurgitation, the causes may be divided into those associated with anatomically abnormal and anatomically normal tricuspid valves. Conditions associated with anatomically abnormal valves include rheumatic, floppy, Ebstein's anomaly, carcinoid, infective endocarditis, papillary muscle dysfunction, and other rarer causes such as radiation, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and endomyocardial fibrosis. Conditions associated with anatomically normal tricuspid valves include multiple causes of cor pulmonale (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, primary pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension due to mitral stenosis). Of 45 necropsy patients with clinically documented pure tricuspid regurgitation, conditions producing pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale, mitral stenosis) were the most frequent etiology (47 percent), followed by floppy (16 percent), rheumatic (11 percent), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (9 percent), Ebstein's anomaly (7 percent), and miscellaneous conditions (10 percent). Of multiple causes of pure mitral regurgitation, tricuspid valve anular circumference and leaflet area are useful measurements in establishing etiology: dilated anuli (greater than 12 cm) are associated with Ebstein's anomaly, floppy valves, and multiple causes of pulmonary hypertension. Increased leaflet areas are associated with floppy valves and Ebstein's anomaly. Anular insertion site separates floppy tricuspid valves from Ebstein's anomaly. Of 21 purely regurgitant operatively-excised tricuspid valves, the etiologies were: rheumatic (43 percent), \"functional\" due to pulmonary hypertension from mitral stenosis (38 percent), Ebstein's anomaly (9 percent), infective endocarditis (5 percent), and floppy (5 percent). In contrast to etiology of pure mitral regurgitation, rheumatic disease is the leading cause for operative excision of purely regurgitant tricuspid valves. Comparison of systolic pulmonary arterial pressures and tricuspid valve morphology disclosed that pulmonary arterial pressures greater than or equal to 55 mm Hg and tricuspid valve anuli greater than 12 cm were associated with anatomically normal tricuspid valves and that pulmonary arterial pressures less than or equal to 40 mm Hg and tricuspid anuli less than 12 cm were associated with anatomically abnormal tricuspid valves.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which myocardial blood flow varies in response to metabolic demand is obscure. One hypothesis is a countercurrent regulation of arterial caliber by diffusible substances carried in venous blood. To study the anatomic basis for blood flow regulation, we performed combined arterial and venous injections in 20 human hearts and studied left ventricular intramyocardial vessels with radiography, 100 micron thick sections, and reconstructions of serial histologic sections. Penetrating arteries lie in interstitial spaces and are closely related to accompanying veins. These interstitial veins partially surround and are indented by branch arteries. A second system of veins lies within muscle fascicles between interstitial spaces and is not related to arteries. The isolated veins have collateral connections with interstitial veins and join them in the subepicardium. This vascular anatomy could allow arterial caliber to be regulated by diffusible substances carried in the interstitial veins. Arterial dilatation might prolong this effect by partial obstruction of interstitial veins, with the isolated venous system providing an alternative pathway for venous drainage and washout. The study shows that a vascular arrangement is present in human left ventricular myocardium that could provide a countercurrent regulation of blood flow with diffusible substances carried in venous blood.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the responses to viprostol, an analog of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that is known to stimulate both the macula densa and the juxtaglomerular cells, and to nitroprusside were compared in patients with CHF. An average fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 6 mm Hg with viprostol was associated with a fivefold increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) from 11.4 +/- 6.4 to 47.9 +/- 31.0 ng/ml/hr; in contrast PRA did not change with nitroprusside, despite a significant decrease in preload and an average decrease in MAP of 16 mm Hg. These data demonstrate that the renin-angiotensin system could be activated by PGE2 in patients with CHF, this activation is not related to the global hemodynamic changes induced by PGE2, and the previously reported unresponsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with CHF cannot be attributed to a defective response of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.\r"

When the men in this cohort were compared, each 1 mg/dl increment in baseline HDL-C (mean 44.3 mg/dl) was associated with a 5.5% decrement in risk of \"definite\" CHD death or myocardial infarction (Z = -5.4), and each 1 mg/dl increase from baseline HDL-C levels (mean increase = 1.6 mg/dl) during the trial was associated with a 4.4% risk reduction (Z = -2.2). In the 1899 participants receiving placebo, the corresponding risk decrements were 3.4% and 1.1%. Although baseline HDL-C level (mean = 44.4 mg/dl) remained a significant risk predictor (Z = -3.8) in the placebo cohort, increases in HDL-C (mean increase 0.5 mg/dl) were not significantly predictive of CHD (Z = -0.6) unless \"suspect\" as well as \"definite\" end points were analyzed (Z = -2.0). When the associations between HDL-C (baseline plus change) and incidence of definite CHD end points within each treatment cohort were compared, their difference approached nominal significance (Z = 1.9). The results suggest a synergistic interaction, in which cholestyramine treatment reduced CHD risk most substantially in men maintaining the highest HDL-C levels.\r"

The hearts from the ventricular tachycardia group were heavier and more dilated than those from the control group. Histologic analysis of a representative cross section from each heart showed that the ventricular tachycardia group had larger, more solid infarcts than did the control group. The ventricular tachycardia group also had a greater area of spared subendocardium, more hydropic change of the spared subendocardium, and more \"ribbon type\" spared subendocardium, which was defined as spared subendocardium of uniform contour 1 mm thick or less. The ventricular tachycardia group was divided into a subacute subgroup (n = 14, dying less than or equal to 10 weeks after infarction) and a chronic subgroup (n = 8, dying greater than 10 weeks after infarction). The infarcts of the subacute ventricular tachycardia group were more solid and had a greater amount of ribbon type spared subendocardium than those of the chronic ventricular tachycardia group. This information can serve as a baseline for the evaluation of animal preparations of tachycardia and, when combined with knowledge of the location of the arrhythmogenic region furnished by intraoperative mapping, should lead to better understanding of the anatomic substrate for ventricular tachycardia.\r"

A significant (p less than .05) rise in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a decline in stroke volume and cardiac index was observed after a single 10 mg dose. The change in cardiac index was negatively correlated with free drug concentration (r = -.59, p less than .01); the change in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance showed a positive correlation with plasma concentration (r = .67, r = .57, respectively; all p less than .05). The response to exercise reflected a predominant beta-blocking effect, with a significant decrease in peak heart rate and cardiac index and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. There were no significant changes in variables of right or left ventricular inotropy after administration of the drug. The mean baseline plasma norepinephrine concentration for the population was 609 +/- 172 pg/ml (normal = 196 +/- 7 pg/ml) and was markedly elevated in two patients (931 and 2053 pg/ml) who developed severe pindolol-induced hypotension. Renin increased markedly in these two patients, but decreased in each of the remaining eight patients. These data indicate that although inotropy is not adversely affected by pindolol, increased afterload, which appears to be mediated by peripheral beta-blockade, results in a reduction in ventricular performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements in vivo by the same technique were also obtained from common carotid arteries of 10 young normal male subjects. Aortic samples were classified as class A (relatively normal) or class B (with one or more atherosclerotic plaques). In all class A and 85% of class B arterial samples a characteristic B mode image composed of two parallel echogenic lines separated by a hypoechoic space was found. The distance between the two lines (B mode image of intimal + medial thickness) was measured and correlated with the thickness of different combinations of tunicae evaluated by gross and microscopic examination. On the basis of these findings and the results of dissection experiments on the intima and adventitia we concluded that results of B mode imaging of intimal + medial thickness did not differ significantly from the intimal + medial thickness measured on pathologic examination. With respect to the accuracy of measurements obtained by B mode imaging as compared with pathologic findings, we found an error of less than 20% for measurements in 77% of normal and pathologic aortic walls. In addition, no significant difference was found between B mode-determined intimal + medial thickness in the common carotid arteries evaluated in vitro and that determined by this method in vivo in young subjects, indicating that B mode imaging represents a useful approach for the measurement of intimal + medial thickness of human arteries in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "87052080\r", 
  ".W": "Blood flow during closed-chest CPR may result from variations in intrathoracic pressure rather than selective compression of the cardiac ventricles. During chest compression, the thoracic and abdominal cavities are subjected to positive pressure fluctuations. It has been suggested that compression of the abdomen may improve left heart outflow during CPR by limiting diaphragmatic movement or improving venous return. Abdominal compression has been performed experimentally with pneumatic abdominal binders and with the abdominal compartment of the conventional military antishock trouser (MAST) garment. The MAST garment might also improve cardiac output with CPR through an \"autotransfusion\" effect. In animal studies, MAST-augmented CPR has improved systolic pressures; it has not been shown to improve vital organ perfusion. In the only available clinical study, CPR with the MAST did not improve survival from prehospital cardiac arrest when compared with conventional CPR alone. If inflation of the MAST does produce blood displacement from the peripheral to the central venous circulation, such an effect may be detrimental in that the arteriovenous pressure gradients necessary for vital organ flow may be adversely affected. Inflation of the MAST during CPR may also adversely effect artificial ventilation. Selective abdominal binding also increases systolic pressures during CPR but does not improve subdiaphragmatic venous return. Although abdominal binding may increase common carotid flow, it has not been shown to improve cerebral or myocardial perfusion when compared with conventional CPR alone. These CPR adjunct techniques have not been shown to improve outcome from cardiac arrest and should remain experimental until further well-designed studies addressing regional vital organ flow and outcome of resuscitation are performed.\r"

The most effective currently available pharmacologic agent is verapamil. Hemodynamically stable patients whose PSVTs are refractory to verapamil may be treated with digitalis. Patients with antegrade accessory pathway conduction (such as those with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) and a history of atrial fibrillation should be treated with intravenous procainamide if they are hemodynamically stable and with synchronized electrical countershock if they are hemodynamically unstable. Synchronized electrical countershock is the treatment of choice for hemodynamically unstable patients.\r"

The urgency of delivering definitive therapy is emphasized, and the roles of automatic internal and external defibrillators, practical external pacing, and mechanical techniques for cardioversion and defibrillation are evaluated. Standard position of the electroplates is recommended except in patients who have permanently implanted pacemakers. In these patients, the defibrillation electrodes should be at least 5 inches from the pacemaker generator. The energy requirement for defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation is reviewed, with the conclusion that the initial defibrillatory shock should be 200 J. The determinants of the transthoracic impedance are important, especially if low-energy shocks are to be used, since a high transthoracic impedance results in a poor success rate for defibrillation with low-energy shocks. When high-energy (360 J) shocks are to be used, transthoracic impedance appears to be of less importance.\r"

If the initial shock fails to defibrillate it should be repeated immediately, at the same energy level, and then increased if defibrillation is still not achieved. If the initial shock defibrillates but refibrillation occurs later there is no reason to increase the energy; it should be repeated at 200 J. We suggest the following energy selection algorithm for defibrillation (VF = ventricular fibrillation): (Formula: see text).\r"

Cerebral recovery from more than 5 min of cardiac arrest is hampered by complex secondary derangements of multiple organ systems after reperfusion. There is increasing support of our hypothesis that this \"postresuscitation syndrome\" includes the following: secondary cerebral perfusion failure, cerebral reoxygenation injury (cell-necrotizing cascades), and cerebral \"intoxication\" from derangements of extracerebral organs. To be optimal for the brain, CPR with optimal perfusion pressure must be started as promptly as possible. Significant though inconsistent mitigation of permanent brain damage after prolonged complete global brain ischemia has been achieved in animal outcome preparations with the use of the following treatments initiated at the start of reperfusion: brain-oriented extracerebral life support by protocol, intra-arterial hemodilution, hypertension, and artificial circulation, barbiturates, calcium-entry blockers, free-radical scavengers, and multifaceted treatments. We currently recommend treatment 1 for patient care and treatment 2 for clinical feasibility trials. Treatment 3, thiopental loading (starting 10 to 50 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation), was tested in a randomized clinical trial and was not shown to confer a statistically significant benefit. A calcium-entry blocker is under clinical investigation. Many other novel treatments appear promising but further animal studies are required. The complex multifactorial pathogenesis of postcardiac arrest encephalopathy requires systematic multicenter development of etiology-specific combination therapies.\r"

Considerable data have accumulated suggesting that forward flow during CPR is generated, at least in part, by the development of elevated intrathoracic pressure with an extrathoracic arteriovenous pressure difference. This mechanism, known as the \"thoracic pump,\" has been documented during \"cough-CPR\" and has led to numerous attempts at optimizing the outcome by increasing intrathoracic pressure in CPR. Studies have demonstrated improved flows with simultaneous ventilation and sternal compression, with static or interposed abdominal compression, with longer duration compression, and with various combinations of these maneuvers. Other recent studies have suggested that the cardiac compression mechanism may indeed be operative, at least under certain circumstances, and that CPR may be optimized by increasing the force and rate of compression. Still others have advocated a simple change in the sequence of initiating ventilation and compression. Which, if any, of these newly advocated methods improve the outcome when applied to man remains to be established. If any of these techniques is shown to be more advantageous, its widespead use will depend on its applicability without adjuncts and its teachability to the lay public.\r"

Manual abdominal compressions cause both central aortic and central venous pressure pulses but, because of differences in venous and arterial capacitance, the former are usually greater than the latter. Thus mean perfusion pressure is enhanced. Limited clinical studies confirm that IAC-CPR can improve perfusion pressures in humans, and reported complications of the technique are rare in animals and man. However, no study has demonstrated that IAC-CPR improves either short- or long-term survival after cardiac arrest in man. Accordingly, the method remains experimental and cannot be recommended for basic life support at the present time.\r"

The present standards, suggested in large part by the investigations of Bishop and Weisfeldt, and the acknowledged toxicity of treatment with bicarbonate led to aggressive use of hyperventilation, the frequent monitoring of pH, and a reduction in bicarbonate administration. However, to date no studies have indicated an improvement in outcome to support the importance of these changes. Instead, controversy continues concerning the most appropriate buffer and whether the pH gradient induced between venous and arterial beds during CPR is of importance. To date, a viable alternative regimen has not been proposed. Thus, at present there is little new data upon which to base a major change in strategy, although the logic of reducing further the use of bicarbonate seems compelling. The choice of antiarrhythmic therapy is equally difficult. Initially, experimental studies suggested a more potent antifibrillatory effect for bretylium than for lidocaine. Subsequent studies have challenged these initial experimental results and clinical data have failed to indicate the benefit of one drug over the other. There is little information to suggest that these agents are more effective than the aggressive use of defibrillation alone in patients with ventricular fibrillation. It therefore seems improbable that a definitive decision concerning the use of one or another of these agents can be made.\r"

During cardiac arrest, catecholamines and pressor agents have been shown to improve the rate of success of resuscitation. The useful properties of these drugs are mediated by strong alpha-adrenergic stimulation resulting in improved coronary perfusion. beta-Adrenergic stimulation during cardiac arrest is unimportant for resuscitation and potentially harmful. Studies have not demonstrated a difference between mixed agonists and alpha-agonists with respect to overall outcome. Consequently, the panel recommended that epinephrine continue to be the primary vasopressor for use during cardiac arrest. For cardiovascular support in the hemodynamically unstable patient, the panel recommended that drugs be chosen for specific pharmacologic actions that will allow the needed physiologic manipulation guided by objective hemodynamic measurements. The panel found that digitalis preparations and corticosteroids have very limited use in emergency cardiac care.\r"

Since the last AHA conference on ACLS standards, little controversy has arisen regarding the use of oxygen, morphine, vasodilators, or potent diuretics. In 1979, a full vagolytic dose of atropine was recommended for use early in the course of asystolic or bradycardiac arrest. Since then reports suggest that this higher dose of atropine may be of some limited value in treating this highly resistant form of arrest. The routine use of calcium for asystole, bradycardiac arrest, and electromechanical dissociation has come under intense scrutiny. Studies have failed to demonstrate improved survival and have found potentially deleterious levels of serum calcium when calcium was administered according to AHA standards. It is also possible that postanoxic cerebral injury is exacerbated by the use of calcium. No controversy exists, however, concerning the use of calcium for the moribund patient with possible hypocalcemia or with an excess of calcium-channel blockers. The use of calcium-channel blockers has been advocated to prevent or retard the intracellular accumulation of calcium, which may cause irreversible postanoxic tissue damage. Calcium-channel blockers may also be useful in preventing or decreasing cerebral and coronary arteriospasm. These drugs have antianginal properties that may decrease ischemia. The antiarrhythmic effect of verapamil is particularly useful in the treatment of uncomplicated paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Verapamil and diltiazem slow conduction through the atrioventricular node and may be used to slow the ventricular response in atrial fibrillation and flutter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reports of side effects and complications have been numerous. Studies of calcium assays following American Heart Association recommended dosages have shown dangerously elevated serum levels. Large retrospective clinical studies in Milwaukee and Tampa have found no evidence of improved survival with calcium chloride in asystole and EMD. A prospective randomized double-blind study comparing calcium chloride and saline controls in the Milwaukee Paramedic system for asystole and EMD using standard AHA protocols showed no statistically significant difference in resuscitation rates or long-term survival between the calcium and no-calcium groups for the rhythm of asystole. Although patients with EMD had statistically improved resuscitation rates when calcium chloride was given, only one of the patients survived to hospital discharge. Because of the low rates of resuscitation and long-term survival in patients presenting in asystole and EMD, proving that calcium chloride does not enhance survival would require large multicenter trials. However, since no controlled study has ever documented significant benefit, its routine use in asystole and EMD cannot be supported. Calcium has long been used in medical treatment of hypocalcemic and hyperkalemic states and should be administered in moribund patients who have the proper clinical history and clinical signs of hypocalcemia.\r"

All three calcium-channel blockers available, diltiazem, nifedipine, and verapamil, can reduce the frequency of angina occurring both at rest and with exertion. Calcium may mediate several cytotoxic events during the reperfusion period after prolonged ischemia that lead to irreversible cell injury. There is experimental evidence that calcium-channel blockers may reduce the cellular influx of calcium after ischemia and reperfusion, and thereby attenuate cerebral and myocardial injury, although most studies have failed to show benefit of treatment unless the drug is administered before the onset of ischemia. Most trials using calcium-channel blockers in the setting of acute myocardial infarction have failed to show a benefit of treatment. The safety and efficacy of calcium-channel blockers have yet to be shown in controlled studies of human resuscitation, although the potential for such treatment, if it is effective in attenuating myocardial cerebral cellular injury, could be enormous.\r"

A number of alterations of the conventional CPR technique were proposed, many resulting in improved hemodynamics when compared with standard CPR techniques in the same subject. However, some of the proposed methods increased cerebral blood flow but decreased myocardial perfusion. Others improved systolic pressures but decreased vital organ blood flow. More importantly, most studies with survival as an end point failed to show a benefit when alternative approaches to CPR were used. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be significant changes in the recommendations for the use of adjuncts during CPR. Not all studies support the conclusion that blood flow during closed-chest compression is secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure. It is probable that in man there is a spectrum. In some individuals the predominant mechanism of blood flow during CPR may be cardiac and/or vascular compression, and in others flow may be secondary to an increased intrathoracic pressure.\r"

The laboratory findings in different phases of the disease were compared. The mean level of IgA-plaque forming cells (IgA PFC) in IgAN patients with normal renal function was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the mean control value. In contrast, they were reduced significantly in those patients who were subjected to periodic hemodialysis (p less than 0.001). Disease activity produced a significant increase in IgG PFC and IgA PFC, high IgG and IgM serum levels, high circulating IgG ICs, and low C3b-mediated phagocytic function of the peripheral macrophages. These findings demonstrate that IgAN is associated with an increased number of IgG and IgA-secreting cells in the peripheral blood of patients during the active phase of the disease and that the concurrent presence of high levels of circulating Ig ICs may be responsible for the gross hematuria, as their deposition in the glomeruli could activate the complement system.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups: Group A, 17 patients receiving oral prednisolone/prednisone for four months; and Group B, 17 patients receiving no corticosteroid therapy and acting as controls. The groups are comparable in age of presentation, sex ratio, and duration of study. No difference in serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance, serum IgA levels, severity of renal histopathological changes, incidence of hypertension or incidence of impaired renal function could be demonstrated but the Group A patients had significantly heavier proteinuria. During the mean study period of 38 months (range 12-106), no significant difference in serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance was demonstrated between the two groups. Forty percent of the Group A patients developed complications related to steroid therapy. Despite the overall lack of therapeutic value in IgA nephropathy with nephrotic syndrome as reflected by change in renal function, corticosteroid treatment resulted in excellent remission of nephrotic syndrome in 80% of patients with mild glomerular histopathological changes. Our findings suggest that corticosteroid therapy is only beneficial to selected groups of patients with IgA nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome but its indiscriminate use should be discouraged.\r"

Particular care has to be taken in the use of angiography techniques because of the invasiveness and of the potential toxicity of radiopaque contrast material, even in the less invasive radiological tests, like endovenous sequential angiourography with image subtraction (SAU) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Fifty-one patients have been examined with echo-Doppler velocimetry (EDV) and also with SAU in order to verify the previous status of the artery. EDV exhibits a 100% sensitivity: all SAU detected stenosis have been formerly identified via EDV. The non-invasiveness and possibility of early repetition allows an early diagnosis capability for all transplanted patients. In this way, a surgical intervention may quite often be prevented by a precocious use of endoluminal angioplasty.\r"

Calcitriol, 1 microgram daily, regularly induced hypercalcemia. Doses of 0.25 microgram daily or less proved satisfactory in most patients. During calcitriol treatment, plasma calcium concentration was significantly higher and serum parathyroid hormone concentration significantly lower than on placebo. There was no difference in the rates of development or of progression of vascular calcification in the two groups. Significantly more patients on placebo (17 vs. 6, p less than 0.05) developed a sustained elevation of plasma alkaline phosphatase concentration. Calcitriol appeared to protect against the development of histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa but not of osteomalacia, but accumulation of aluminum in bone occurred during the study. We conclude that calcitriol delays and may prevent the development of osteitis fibrosa in patients receiving regular hemodialysis and may reasonably be prescribed routinely in hemodialysis patients without biochemical or radiological abnormality, unless there is a substantial prospect of early renal transplantation.\r"

DNMN lesions were classified as stage I, II or III upon light and electron microscopy examination. Seven biopsies were classified as stage I DNMN and 8 stage II-III. All patients were proteinuric. In six biopsies with stage I DNMN, staining for C5b-9 neoantigens was restricted to a fine granular labeling in mesangial areas which was analogous to that seen in normal kidneys in contrast with extensive parietal labeling for IgG, C3d and factor H antigens. In eight biopsies with stage II-III DNMN, the pattern of staining with anti-C5b-9 neoantigens antibodies was similar to that obtained with anti-IgG, anti-C3d and anti-factor H antibodies. These results suggest that in situ activation of the whole complement sequence throughout C5b-9 only occurs on large immune deposits (stage II-III DNMN).\r"

Epidemiologic evidence points to the existence of an entity of \"generalized OA\" composed of three or more locations with involvement of the interphalangeals. Heredity in cases associated with distal interphalangeal OA and inflammation in cases with proximal interphalangeal OA are the factors found to be most closely correlated to generalized OA. Surveys of several series of OA of the hip have pointed to the existence of several clinicoradiologic subsets that could have different clinical correlates and various pathophysiologic mechanisms. Because several conditions, such as crystal arthropathy, diffuse skeletal hyperostosis, and subsets of OA, have been described in recent years, a reappraisal of an epidemiologic approach of OA is advisable.\r"

The preparation bacterial counts among inpatients, who received preoperative hexachlorophene showers, were significantly lower than that of outpatients, who did not receive preoperative showers.

  ".W": "The cells of cartilage are constantly remodeling the matrix in which they are suspended. The stimulus to initiate remodeling is probably the chondrocyte's response to physical and or chemical changes in the environment. Heat, pressure, friction, load, pH, and growth are examples of such factors, which, if altered, would have a dramatic effect on the cell's state of health. The mode of response by the chondrocyte is specific for a given stimulus. Elevated temperature, for example, switches on a set of genes, the heat shock genes, in chondrocytes. This results in the synthesis of a series of cellular protein that presumably in turn protects the cell from the injurious effects of heat. Load and pressure affect both the synthetic rate of matrix protein and the degradation rates of preexisting matrix. A number of low-molecular-weight proteins appear to be involved in anabolic and catabolic processes of cartilage. A protein recently isolated from synovium stimulates the synthesis of degradative enzymes in cartilage. This factor is probably involved in the remodeling process under normal physiologic conditions. More recently, it has been found in elevated levels under pathologic conditions such as in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. The mechanism by which this factor turns on the degradative pathway appears complex and is under investigation.\r"

The experimental design was identical to that of another study, in which prevention of cartilage erosions was indicated by gross morphologic and histologic parameters. In the present study, enzyme activities were measured for neutral metalloprotease(s), (NMPE), serine protease(s) and thiol protease(s) in extracts from cartilage obtained at sacrifice. Control cartilage enzyme activities consisted of intact normal and surgically altered rabbits treated with saline matched for each regimen. In the positive controls, there were highly significant elevations of NMPE active on proteoglycans and serine protease activity per milligram of wet cartilage at 20 weeks, as well a highly significant elevation of metalloprotease 12 weeks after operation. A significantly lower level of active NMPE was found in experimental groups compared with positive controls. Cell counts per unit volume were doubled in the treated versus untreated cartilages. Hexuronate as an index of proteoglycan content was reduced in positive controls and restored to normal levels or higher with the use of GAGPS in both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens.\r"

  ".W": "The unsatisfactory results of total hip arthroplasty in the young patient led to the development of the concept of hip resurfacing. Total hip articular replacement by internal eccentric shells (THARIES) resurfacing was introduced in 1975, with the primary goal of bone stock preservation and the hope of increased durability in the young patient. Major changes in design and technique include thicker and more uniform acrylic layers, metal-backed flanged acetabular component, and reduction in femoral size for preservation of acetabular bone stock. Of the 584 hips (average patient age, 48 years) with one- to ten-year follow-up study, there have been 72 failures (revision rate, 12.3%) with 66 cases of loosening (nearly all beginning in or limited to the acetabular side), two neck fractures, and four sepses. Survivorship analysis revealed that the single most important factor related to prosthesis failure is age followed by diagnosis and experience of the surgeon. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis were favorable categories with congenital dysplastic hip (CDH), osteonecrosis, and previous failed resurfacing being unfavorable categories. Experience has taught the importance in preserving acetabular bone stock, providing bone graft for socket coverage in severe dysplasia, and removing dead bone in osteonecrosis. While resurfacing did not solve the problems of the young patient, even those patients who failed often gained time for application of the newer techniques and materials. The femoral component infrequently failed. The head remained vascular. This leads the authors to conclude that the surface arthroplasty concept is a viable alternative to total hip arthroplasty and seems to be ideal for the application of porous technology.\r"

Radiation parameters were selected after a pilot dose-ranging trial, and were 70-120 KVP, 10-30mA and 0.8 to 5msec pulse width. Single view digital angiograms were compared to single view conventional angiograms in 27 patient; the two angiograms agreed within one grade of severity in 84 percent of the lesions or normal arteries seen. Multiple view digital angiograms were compared to multiple view conventional angiograms in 50 patients. Agreement within one grade of severity was found for 90 percent of lesions or normal arteries.

The methacholine inhalation test and challenges with distilled water and exercise were performed on three separate days 48 hours apart. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and ultrasonically nebulized distilled water was measured as the concentration of methacholine (PC20M) and the volume output of the ultrasonic nebulizer (PO20 UNDW) producing a 20 percent fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The response to exercise was expressed as the percentage of fall in FEV1 from the value before exercise. Seventeen subjects showed a fall in FEV1 of more than 20 percent after exercise. Eight subjects had a stimulus-response curve to distilled water that was flat up to the maximal volume output from the nebulizer, but only four of them also showed no significant response to exercise. The response to exercise correlated better with PO20 UNDW (r = -0.66; p less than 0.01) than with PC20M (r = -0.19; p greater than 0.5) in those responding to distilled water. In all of the tested subjects, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction correlated with PC20M (r = -0.61; p less than 0.01). The mean PC20M was significantly lower in the subjects with a significant response to distilled water and exercise (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0001, respectively). We concluded that ultrasonically nebulized distilled water and exercise provoke significant bronchoconstriction in the subjects with more severe nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The correlation found between the two stimuli supports the hypothesis that they act by similar mechanisms.\r"

Loculation was found to be a radiologic marker of diagnostic and prognostic significance. The presence of loculations correlated with exudative pleural fluid chemistries, but no radiologic finding was specific for empyema. \"Extreme\" pleural fluid chemistries were associated with loculation, but not with empyema. Patients with loculated effusions had larger effusions, longer hospitalizations, and more frequent tube thoracostomy procedures than patients with nonloculated effusions. Light's criteria for tube thoracostomy were found to be unreliable in patients with loculated parapneumonic effusions or in patients treated with prolonged antibiotic therapy prior to thoracocentesis.\r"

  ".W": "Interest has been increasing in providing ventilatory support in the home for patients with chronic respiratory failure, mainly with the use of positive pressure ventilation via a chronic tracheostomy. However, body ventilators that assist ventilation by applying intermittent negative or positive pressure to the thorax, abdomen, or airway without requiring an artificial airway, can offer distinct advantages for selected patients over systems requiring a permanent airway. These ventilators include the iron lung, portable lung (Portalung), pneumowrap, chest cuirass, pneumobelt, rocking bed, and positive pressure provided via a face or nose mask. They have successfully stabilized or reversed chronic hypercarbia when used intermittently in patients with slowly progressive chronic respiratory failure due to certain neuromuscular diseases and kyphoscoliosis. How they achieve this stabilization has not been clarified, but reversal of chronic respiratory muscle fatigue following periodic rest probably contributes. These ventilators are generally less effective than positive pressure ventilation through a tracheostomy and should be reserved for patients with relatively stable chronic respiratory failure and intact upper airways. However, they have the advantages of simpler operation and less expense, and they allow maintenance of a normal airway.\r"

The nocardial lesions appeared small and localized on chest radiograph. On two separate occasions, nocardial organisms were absent in transbronchial lung biopsy specimens, but were identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid probably because the latter specimen sampled a larger area of lung. The patient was initially treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for both infections. When TMP/SMX was discontinued because of an adverse reaction, the nocardiosis promptly exacerbated but was then easily controlled with minocycline and amikacin followed by minocycline and cycloserine. Among patients with AIDS who have sulfamethoxazole hypersensitivity during treatment for nocardiosis, alternative drugs may be efficacious and may be particularly important in this setting because they have a lower incidence of toxicity.\r"

In those at greatest risk, including BMT recipients, detection of disseminated intravascular coagulation; soft, changing systolic cardiac murmurs; hematuria; and signs of central embolic events suggest the diagnosis of NBTE. Awareness of the diagnosis of NBTE is essential for those who must interpret neurologic, myocardial and renal abnormalities in BMT recipients.\r"

Newer agents, such as the third-generation cephalosporins or ureidopenicillins, have the advantage of a broader antimicrobial spectrum and improved pharmacokinetics. The beta-lactams are often promoted as alternatives to more toxic antibiotic regimens. However, several of the beta-lactams have been shown to produce hematological effects, some of which can be life threatening. The primary hematological effects appear to be inhibition of normal platelet function and the coagulation cascade, which is reflected by changes in bleeding times and increases in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, respectively. Although not all patients will develop bleeding problems associated with these agents, close monitoring of patients with risk factors for bleeding and dosage adjustments may help to avert these drug-induced hematological problems.\r"

Cefsulodin is eliminated renally and has a serum half-life similar to ceftazidime and cefoperazone. Cefsulodin appears to be well tolerated and relatively free of any significant toxicity except for nausea and vomiting, which appear to be related to the infusion rate. Cefsulodin may be beneficial in those rare clinical situations where an infection is caused by a sensitive isolate of P. aeruginosa known to be resistant to the other antipseudomonal cephalosporins, and/or the avoidance of an aminoglycoside antibiotic is desired. However, its empiric use is to be discouraged.\r"

Injury severity scores can reliably separate trauma patients into high- and low-mortality groups, but have limitations when applied in triage decision making. Specific predictive models for chest pain patients have improved admitting practices in some emergency departments. Univariate predictors of survival include age, severity of illness, and presence of chronic illnesses, especially cancer. General multivariate models for intensive care patients have correctly categorized hospital outcome in approximately 85 per cent of cases when applied in a retrospective fashion. These models are insufficiently precise for application to individual patients; but they may be helpful in assessing quality of care in the intensive care unit, in assessing efficacy of new technologies, and in utilization review audits.\r"

Because of its objectivity and usefulness as a teaching tool, this algorithmic approach is of practical benefit in the training of residents and students in teaching hospitals, as well as in the community hospital where less experienced physicians manage hypotensive emergency patients more infrequently. In a few instances there has been some reluctance to use the algorithm, but most often it was found to be useful in organizing the work-up and establishing therapeutic priorities. A second branched-chain decision tree was designed for use after the initial resuscitation in hemodynamically unstable patients who only had CVP catheters but were suspected of having hypovolemia. In this algorithm, MAP, HR, urine output, Hct, and CVP are used as criteria. The underlying premise under these conditions was to evaluate increments of volume therapy without exceeding safe CVP pressures (less than 18 mm Hg) in order to obviate fluid overloading. A third algorithm for ICU patients with pulmonary artery catheters was developed from decision rules based on objective physiologic, heuristic, survival data as the criteria for post-trauma and postoperative patients who were critically ill despite apparent success with the initial resuscitation and CVP algorithms. The improved mortality in prospective studies supports the hypothesis that compensatory responses of the survivors are the major determinants of outcome.\r"

We believe that puncture of the subclavian vein from above the clavicle in the segment of the veins over the first rib is the safest anatomic approach to the vein. The first rib under the vein shields the pleural dome and the apex of the lung against the needle puncture, and the tip of the needle is directed away from the apex of the lung. Insertion of double and multiple IV catheters in one vein, adjacent veins, or even veins located away from each other is safe and much less costly than the double- and triple-lumen catheters. The special and unconventional venous cut-downs for providing IV access described here in patients with difficult access may be life saving. The experience with vascular access in our institution indicates that supervised training in vascular access and the personal experience of each physician with these techniques and teamwork help to reduce potential complications.\r"

In all case, attention should be paid to treating the patient and not merely the electrical rhythm. Emergency cardioversion or defibrillation should be performed in tachyarrhythmias with associated significant end-organ hypoperfusion. Early drug therapy, stabilization, and referral for definitive therapy may be appropriate when tachyarrhythmias do not produce significant hemodynamic consequences. Asymptomatic bradycardia should not be treated emergently but referred for definitive care in those circumstances in which it is necessary. Bradycardia associated with end-organ hypoperfusion should be treated with trials of atropine, or isoproterenol, or emergency pacemaker insertion, and the stabilized patient referred to the cardiac procedure laboratory or cardiac care unit as appropriate. This same approach to bradyarrhythmias applies regardless of the anatomic and electrophysiologic etiology of the decreased heart rate. Attention to these few management principles clearly stresses the primary importance of the hemodynamic effects of any arrhythmia other than the arrhythmia itself.\r"
