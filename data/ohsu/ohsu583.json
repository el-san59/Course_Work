Larger volumes may be accommodated in aircraft that decompress to less than 8000 ft or that take off from altitudes above sea level. The patient with residual intraocular gas who experiences pain or dimness of vision in an ascending airplane can obtain relief if the cabin altitude is decreased by 2000 ft. This will require a modest adjustment in the altitude of the airplane.\r"

This model used a slightly prolate shape for a moderately myopic eye and an idealized aspheric profile for the cornea. The finite element method and the nonlinear Mooney-Rivelin law were used to analyze stress-strain relationships. Radial keratotomy changes stress distribution in the cornea and the anterior sclera, with major changes at the paracentral and peripheral ends of the incisions. The model predicted that there would be a flattening of the central cornea with a posterior displacement, which increased with an increase in intraocular pressure. A change in the length of the incision of 0.5 mm produced a significant change in correction. For small clear zones (3 to 4 mm), incisions of equal length produced comparable changes in refraction. We found that the effect of the corneal radius of curvature on the amount of refractive change was negligible. We studied the effect of elasticity coefficients and corneal anisotropia.\r"

Improvement in the bladder management programs of each patient was noted.

Changes in bladder function were associated with the initiation of intrathecal therapy and with changes in pump-delivered dosages. In selected patients, intrathecal baclofen infusion can have a beneficial effect on bladder management programs.\r"

Forty-one PM&R residency program directors in the United States and Puerto Rico completed a survey on the way they selected their residents. The results indicate that personal applicant characteristics, as determined by interview, were more important than academic criteria in ranking residency candidates. Of the academic variables presented, participation in a PM&R elective at the program director's hospital and the Dean's letter were rated highest. The interview experience has a major influence on the ranking of an applicant for acceptance into a PM&R training program. Academic criteria should have more influence on applicant selection than they do at present. In addition, early identification and vigorous recruitment of resident candidates with an interest in research is essential for increasing the number of academic physiatrists within our specialty.\r"

Back extensor strength and power grip of the dominant hand were measured in 68 healthy postmenopausal women. The level of physical activity was determined according to a scale (score, 0-18) that considered vocational and avocational activities. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between back extensor strength and power grip (r = 0.46, P less than 0.001) and back extensor strength and level of physical activity (r = 0.37, P less than 0.002). The correlation between level of physical activity and power grip was much less significant (r = 0.25, P less than 0.05) than that between physical activity and back strength. These data suggest that, in healthy individuals, stronger grip may also indicate stronger back extensor muscles. They also demonstrate that physical activity contributes significantly to the back extensor strength and, to a lesser degree, to the strength of the upper extremities.\r"

For each case, one control matched on sex and date of admission, was chosen. Material from the first year of the cohort (201 cases and 201 controls) was used to define a model to estimate the risk of falling. Of the more than 100 variables considered in the conditional logistic regression models, stroke, incontinence, anticonvulsant medications, and topical eye preparations were significantly associated with the risk of falling. Analyses carried out on the second year of the cohort (155 cases and 155 controls) confirmed the predictive ability of these four variables. By combining the material from both subcohorts we were able to determine that a program to reduce falls directed towards stroke patients and incontinent patients alone could, theoretically, prevent 44% of first falls.\r"

Some of these can be addressed by changes in the study design, but some are inherent in the data and methods we are forced to use. The choice of study design may be based primarily on the quality of the clinical data and available resources for additional data collection. The level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio) of your data must first be determined as it limits the descriptive and statistical techniques you can use. After you decide how many variables to include, a rough guess of sample size will help you select your charts for review. Actual review of three charts will further pinpoint any difficulties and will allow you to revise your study and make an accurate estimate of time to completion. Given the long time span of most projects, accurate record keeping is essential.\r"

To date, somewhat conflicting results have been reported concerning the in vivo infection of LC by HIV as well as the numerical alteration of these cells in the course of HIV infection. In the present work we studied clinically normal skin of a group of 44 HIV-1-seropositive patients classified according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stages II (n = 14), III (n = 9), and IV (n = 21). Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to HIV p18, p24, and gp120 and to HLA-DR and CD1a antigens (specific for LC) were applied on frozen skin sections using an amplification biotin-streptavidin-fluorescein technique. The MAb to HIV p18 cross-reacted with a cytoplasmic antigen of epidermal basal keratinocytes also present on HIV-seronegative skin specimens. No other reactivity was observed with any of the three anti-HIV MAb. The quantitative study showed that no significant correlations could be established between the number of LC (evaluated independently by HLA-DR and CD1a antigens) and the number of peripheral blood CD4+ve lymphocytes or the CDC disease stage. These results cast some doubt on the previously reported in vivo infection and numerical decrease in LC in HIV infection. The precise involvement of LC in HIV infection awaits further investigation.\r"

CSF specimens are isoelectrically focused in agarose gels and blotted to nitrocellulose (NC) strips coated with E. coli recombinant HIV-specific proteins. Virus-specific antibody clones transferred to the filter are detected by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Only 0.5 micrograms IgG is sufficient to demonstrate the clonal distribution of antibodies specific for an individual HIV protein. Intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal antibodies is seen by AMI, comparing equal quantities of serum- and CSF-derived IgG. Because of its excellent sensitivity and specificity, AMI detects autochthonous HIV-specific IgG synthesis even when comparative EIA fails. Because multiple specimens can be processed within a few hours by AMI, this technique is recommendable for routine diagnosis.\r"

HIV-1 core antigen (p24) was not detected in either the concentrated or the unconcentrated HIV-1--seropositive adult urine samples; none of these individuals showed overt clinical or laboratory evidence of renal dysfunction. The titer of the antibodies to HIV-1 found in the urine specimens was found to be parallel with the titer of antibodies to HIV-1 in the corresponding individual's serum.

All SIVmac env sequences were recognized by sera from the SIV/Mne-inoculated macaques. Western blot analysis performed with whole SIV/Mne, SIVmac, SIVagm, and HIV-1 antigens and sera from SIV/Mne-infected macaques also demonstrates that SIV/Mne is immunologically more closely related to SIVmac than to SIVagm or to HIV-1. Antibody levels to the gp120 NH2-terminal SIV-88 epitope appear to decrease in the infected Macaca nemestrina with progression of disease, as was also reported for the parallel HIV-1 epitope in HIV-1-infected individuals. Sera from all infected macaques reacted with the p32E-SIV-582 epitope (EKYLEDQAQLNAWGCAFRQVC). High titers to this immunodominant epitope could be detected at least 9 weeks postinfection and at a time when primarily the p28 and p32E antibodies were detectable in Western blots performed with whole disrupted SIV/Mne virus. In the majority of animals, antibody titers of 1:100,000 to SIV-582 develop during the infection and persist until death. Antibody responses to the SIV env epitopes in SIV/Mne-infected macaques thus resemble in many aspects (prevalence and immunogenicity) those observed previously for the corresponding HIV-1 env epitopes in HIV-1-infected humans.\r"

Of 124 sera collected from yellow baboons in central Tanzania, two gave high readings by SIVagm ELISA (greater than 1.0) and moderate by SIVmac ELISA (0.5-1.0). These two sera gave strong reactions to the major SIVagm proteins, including gp130, by western blot analysis; their reactivity to SIVmac protein was considerably weaker. Similar testing of 155 sera from olive baboons of Ethiopia revealed no clearly positive sera. Thus, 2 of 279 baboon sera or 0.7% were positive for antibodies to SIV. The strong reactivity of the two positive yellow baboon sera with SIVagm proteins raises questions about whether these animals may have been infected by green monkeys in their native habitat; baboons occasionally prey upon and eat green monkeys. In addition to these two clearly positive samples, one olive baboon serum and one yellow baboon serum reacted only with major gag protein (p24-p26). Continued study of prevalence and diversity of SIV in primates will be important for understanding the history and evolution of primate lentiviruses and, it is hoped, the origins of viruses that cause AIDS in humans.\r"

  ".W": "In theory, screening directly for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA has advantages over screening for HIV-related antibodies; however, the HIV genome appears to be present only in a small fraction of peripheral blood cells from infected individuals. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specifically amplifies defined DNA segments, permitting the identification of specific DNA segments even if they are present in a fraction of cells. HIV-derived PCR-amplified segments have been detected by Southern transfer, \"dot-blot\" hybridization, and digestion with restriction endonucleases. Unfortunately, PCR may amplify not only the single segment of interest but also irrelevant segments, which can be incorrectly identified as HIV related. We describe here an alternative approach to specific detection of PCR-amplified DNA segments, the probe-shift assay, that is simpler, faster, and less subject to erroneous identification than the previously described techniques. The probe-shift assay relies on the hybridization of an appropriately labeled oligonucleotide probe to the amplified segment in solution. The hemiduplex formed between the amplified DNA and the probe is detected following fractionation on nondenaturing gels. This procedure is sufficiently sensitive to detect a single infected cell in the presence of more than 10(5) uninfected cells and has been applied directly to clinical samples.\r"

While breathing room air, five of six animals showed an increased PaO2 of 5-10 torr above reference values. In cases of mild hypoxia, increases of 5-25 torr were observed. No increase in PaO2 was seen when hypoxia was severe. A mathematical model was used to analyze the data and determine a transport coefficient (k). Calculated k values were 1.18 +/- 0.151 ml O2 STPD per minute for normoxic animals and 0.91 +/- 0.180 ml O2 STPD per minute for hypoxic animals, respectively. The estimated transport coefficients are small and indicate that physiologically significant amounts of O2 cannot be delivered by the proposed method under the experimental conditions used. The low k values were attributed to long diffusion distances and small effective surface areas in the abdominal cavity.\r"

  ".W": "Blood trauma has been one of the main problems of centrifugal pumps. The difficulties in reducing hemolysis are many, and all the factors causing excessive hemolysis always act together, making them difficult to discover and distinguish. Furthermore, error could occur at many points during hemolysis testing, making it difficult to repeat results. In developing the low hemolysis pulsatile and nonpulsatile impeller pumps the authors established an experimental method for investigating and searching for the hemolysis factors. In this study two pumps with only one differing factor were compared or only one factor on one pump was changed in the middle of the test period. In this way the effect of the individual factor on pump hemolysis could be seen and some factors have been thus confirmed as important reasons for hemolysis: 1) the drift of the pump output (including the volume and efficiency) from the design point; 2) impeller vane angles, i.e., the radial logarithmic spiral angle and the axial helical spiral angle; 3) roughness of vane surface and other blood contacting surfaces of the sealing box and pump housing; 4) vibration of the rotor resulting from dynamic disequilibrium; and 5) prerotation swirl at the inlet of the pump. The blood pressure to be pumped has been shown to have no influence on pump hemolysis. After eliminating the hemolysis factors, the blood trauma of the impeller heart has been reduced remarkably. The index of hemolysis of the nonpulsatile pump is 0.015, about one fifth of a clinically used roller made in Shanghai and two sevenths of one Sarns 7,000 Roller; the index of hemolysis of the pulstile pump is 0.020, about one sixth of a self-made diaphragm pump and one thirteenth of the Polystan pulsa tile pump.\r"

This technique has the advantages without the inconveniences of bicarbonate dialysis that result from complicated hardware and the need of frequent trouble shooting. In biofiltration, 1) the sodium dialysate concentration should be monitored according to the patient's body weight gain and to the sodium concentration of infusion fluid to obtain adequate sodium mass balance and 2) plasma bicarbonate is easily controlled because the final plasma bicarbonate concentration depends upon the bicarbonate infusion flow rate. Long-term follow-up evaluation (6-24 months) of 76 patients on a dialysis strategy of 3 hr three times a week from 17 European dialysis centers has shown that biofiltration is a simple and safe alternative to bicarbonate dialysis. It could be the way to fulfill the requirements of short time/high quality dialysis, which seems to be the developing trend of dialysis in the future. These advantages are, however, balanced by the extra cost of high flux dialyzers and infusion fluid.\r"

  ".W": "It is unclear whether patients should be tested for the presence of HIV antibody. This test has taken upon itself a significance beyond a simple hemoglobin. Extreme views on testing are prevalent, both from the Centers for Disease Control, which does not recommend routine testing, to physicians advocating screening. The prevalence of HIV virus in our population undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was investigated. Eighty-two patients ranging in age from 7-72 years were screened. There were seven positive results by both ELISA and Western Blot assays. Four had no risk factors, except for transfusion therapy before HIV screening. Three were known homosexuals. Only two of the HIV positive patients and three of the rest of the dialysis population had serologic markers for Hepatitis B infection. This 9% prevalence was much higher than expected. Although the data suggest that the risk to the health care worker is low, current recommendations to treat all patients as if they may be HIV positive protect the hospital or dialysis facility but may be unworkable. The health care workers attention is not focused because they do not differentiate between low and high risk patient groups. Furthermore, the number of patients who acquired the virus prior to routine screening is unknown. Because most dialysis patients were alive and transfused during this time period they may have inadvertently acquired the virus. If others share these findings, the implications for control of this disease are frightening, as the risk of transmission to patients' sexual partners is not inconsequential. I believe these findings support routine screening for HIV antibody.\r"

In this study, six sheep had a veno-venous bypass using membrane oxygenators with either total HBS or, in a control group, with untreated surfaces. Under strictly standardized conditions (body weight, drugs, geometry of tube, catheters, etc.), the animals in both groups received 300 IU/kg heparin before the catheterization as a bolus injection. In both groups, the measured heparin level decreased within 6 hours to zero, accompanied by a fall of other coagulation parameters (ACT, PTT etc.) to normal. In the control group, the ECC failed at this point because of clots in the oxygenators, whereas perfusions using HBS continued without further changes in clotting parameters until 12, 22, and 53 hours when the experiments were stopped intentionally. During the first 6 hours platelets showed a similar decrease in number in both groups and were comparable with conventional heparin treatment during further ECC periods. Other parameters, such as AT III, FXa, fibrinogen, and leukocytes were normal in both groups. The plasma hemoglobin increased markedly at the end of perfusion time in the control group but remained low even after 53 hours of ECC with HBS. The results indicate that the use of such completely heparin bonded systems can lead to a drastic reduction in systemic heparin administration.\r"

In addition, the covalent cross link prevents dissociation of the HbXL tetramers. By using 3H-labeled HbXL, the present study investigated intravascular retention time of cross linked Hb (HbXL), organ distribution, and routes by which HbXL is metabolized and eliminated from the body. The rats were injected with an i.v. bolus (125-200 mg Hb/kg body weight) of either 3H-labeled HbXL or noncross-linked pyridoxal 5'-phosphate modified Hb (diPLPHb) as a control. Urine and feces were collected daily for up to 9 days. Organs and tissues were harvested either at 9 hr or 9 days and assayed for 3H-label content by standard liquid scintillation counting. Plasma retention of HbXL at this dose was about three times longer than diPLPHb, and no HbXL as such was recovered in the urine. HbXL did undergo metabolic degradation in the body, with labeled fragments (mol. wt. less than 10,000) being excreted by the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Total body clearance of the label by 9 days amounted to approximately 83% of the injected dose.\r"

Twenty-three patients were without clinically detectable ascites (minimal ascites--Group A), and three had large ascites (Group B). In 20 Group A patients the shunts were patent and functioning. The other three Group A patients had completely occluded shunts without demonstrable ascitic fluid flow. In one Group B patient with a daily fluid intake of 5-6 L, the shunt was partially obstructed but flow was rapid; in the other two, shunts were completely occluded. One subject in Group B with a completely obstructed shunt was resistant to medical treatment after 6 years of freedom from ascites, whereas the other two were controlled medically. In the three in Group A who had nonfunctioning shunts and required no diuretics, the severity of the ascites had decreased so that artificial drainage was no longer necessary. Thus, freedom from clinically significant ascites does not always indicate that the shunt continues to function.\r"

At both degrees of spontaneous recovery, neostigmine 40 micrograms kg-1 evoked the most rapid antagonism. Clinical recovery was satisfactory with no differences between groups. Block produced by neostigmine was not observed. The pattern of recovery of the single response and the TOF ratio was not altered by neostigmine in the range of doses studied.

Neuromuscular block was monitored by recording the compound electromyogram of the adductor pollicis muscle resulting from supramaximal train-of-four stimuli applied to the ulnar nerve. Time to onset of complete block and recovery to T5 were significantly shorter for suxamethonium than for mivacurium (1.0 (0.1) v. 2.5 (0.3) min and 6.4 (0.7) v. 17.5 (1.8) min; mean (SEM]. Conditions for tracheal intubation were similar in the two groups although intubation was performed 0.75-1.3 min later following mivacurium. The infusion rate required to maintain neuromuscular block was 88.6 (10.4) micrograms kg-1 min-1 for suxamethonium and 7.8 (1.2) micrograms kg-1 min-1 for mivacurium. There was a significant negative correlation between recovery to T5 and infusion rate for mivacurium and for suxamethonium. It was equally easy to titrate the infusion rate to the desired degree of block in each group.

Mean ratio of UV:MV concentrations of bupivacaine was 0.346 and for UA:MV it was 0.305. There was no significant correlation between any fetal:maternal ratio and FDD or LDD. UA:UV ratio appeared to increase towards unity 30-40 min after the last dose. The presence of adrenaline was associated with an increase in UA:UV in the elective group (P less than 0.01). In eight patients who received adrenaline there was reverse placental transfer (UA:UV greater than 1). There was no evidence of progressive fetal accumulation of bupivacaine beyond 30-40 min.\r"

The patients were assigned in a random double-blind fashion to receive 0.6 ml kg-1 of one of two anaesthetic solutions: 1% lignocaine with 1 in 100,000 noradrenaline or 0.25% bupivacaine. Bupivacaine produced a similar onset time but longer duration of action compared with lignocaine. Median peak plasma concentrations of six patients in each group did not approach values associated with toxicity. This study demonstrated a 12.5% and 87.5% partial and complete femoral nerve block, respectively, and a 67.5% success rate for lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh using Winnie's technique.

Fourteen rabbits were anaesthetized with 4% halothane in oxygen, the trachea intubated and the lungs ventilated mechanically with 30% oxygen and 1% halothane in nitrogen. Animals were assigned randomly to receive either an infusion of laudanosine (laudanosine group, n = 7) at a rate calculated to produce plasma concentrations similar to those found following the clinical use of atracurium, or an equal volume of normal saline (control group, n = 7). To induce an epileptogenic focus, gelfoam sponges soaked in a pH-adjusted 4% cefazolin solution were applied bilaterally to the parietal cortical surface. This resulted in the production of spike and burst EEG activity in all animals. However, scoring the frequency of the spikes and bursts revealed no significant differences between the laudanosine and control groups. We conclude that, in this animal model of epilepsy, no increased incidence of seizure activity was produced by mean plasma laudanosine concentrations as great as 0.8 micrograms ml-1. These results suggest that the routine use of atracurium is unlikely to provoke seizures, even in the presence of an epileptogenic focus.\r"

Plasma concentration of glutathione S-transferase B1 subunits (GST) was measured as a sensitive index of hepatic damage. Data from 53 patients were analysed. Plasma GST concentration increased significantly at 3 and 6 h after induction of anaesthesia in the placebo group (P less than 0.01), and at 3 h (P less than 0.01) and 6 h (P less than 0.05) in the nicardipine group. The administration of nicardipine resulted in a greater increase in plasma GST concentrations at 3 h than did placebo (P less than 0.05), mainly because of a greater increase in males than in females. The increase in GST at 3 h was related inversely to plasma concentration of nicardipine both at the end of the exponential infusion (P less than 0.01) and at 2 h after induction (P less than 0.05), when males had lower plasma nicardipine concentrations than females (P less than 0.05). Calcium channel blockade with nicardipine in the dose administered was not shown to reduce liver dysfunction after halothane anaesthesia.\r"

Contractile responses to caffeine and electrical stimulation also were suppressed by diltiazem in control tissue. Similar effects were obtained in the presence of dantrolene. In both MHS and control preparations, diltiazem antagonized caffeine-induced contractures in the presence of maximal effective concentrations of dantrolene, and the converse was true also. In MHS and control preparations detubulated by glycerol, diltiazem did not inhibit or antagonize caffeine-induced contractures while dantrolene did. Diltiazem seems to modify contractile responses at the level of the transverse tubule membrane by inhibiting the inward flow of extracellular Ca2+, while dantrolene inhibits Ca2+ release directly from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ influx through transverse tubules may be important in the aetiology of the MH syndrome.\r"

CS was significantly suppressed when mice were sensitized in the hyperthermia treated skin I, 2 or 4 days after treatment (43 degrees C for 45 min). This suppressive effect was not observed 7 or 14 days after the treatment. CS was also suppressed when mice were sensitized in non-treated skin I day after the treatment. The density of LCs detected as ATPase-positive cells also decreased significantly 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after the treatment. There appeared to be a positive correlation between the number of LCs and the extent of CS when mice were sensitized at hyperthermia treated skin. It was observed that this suppressive effect on CS was dose- and temperature-dependent. It could be transferred by spleen cells from the hyperthermia treated and DNFB-sensitized donors, and was antigen specific when spleen cells were transferred before sensitization of the recipient mice. This indicated it was, in part, associated with the induction of suppressor cells. These findings suggest that local hyperthermia treatment reduces the number of LCs with subsequent suppression of the induction phase of delayed-type hypersensitivity by the generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells.\r"

Since thyroid hormone (T3) affects growth and differentiation in other organs, we examined the effects of its absence on keratinocytes in vitro. Human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes were cultivated and second passage cells were switched to T3-depleted (-T3) medium at 50% confluence. Cells maintained in the -T3 medium demonstrated increased (1.5 fold) levels of the cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase and increased (1.5 fold) formation of cornified envelopes, when compared to keratinocytes maintained in medium containing physiologic levels (2 X 10(-9)M) of T3. Additionally, in the -T3 cultures, the level of the protease plasminogen activator (PA), an enzyme implicated in the process of shedding of cornified cells, was decreased 70-80% of that measured in +T3 media. Absence of T3 from keratinocyte culture-medium increased both the level of the enzyme responsible for cross-linking cornified envelope precursors and the rate of envelope formation in cultured cells. The decreased levels of PA observed in the -T3 cultures could result in decreased shedding of cornified cells. These alterations in the process of keratinocyte differentiation may explain the clinically observed scaliness associated with hypothyroidism in humans. The molecular mechanism by which T3 alters keratinocyte cornification is not yet known.\r"

The difference in Ag NOR counts between all types of naevi and all types of melanoma was highly statistically significant, but there was no difference between banal naevi and dysplastic, Spitz, and spindle cell naevi. Correlation of Ag NOR counts between three independent observers was good. This technique may, therefore, be a useful adjunct in separating true melanoma from borderline melanocytic naevi.\r"

This newly described collagen forms the major component of anchoring fibrils. These findings are consistent with established ultrastructural data which have shown that the epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen is located within and below the lamina densa. The monoclonal antibody LH 7.2 provides an internal standard for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita autoantisera activity. The use of immunoblotting of epidermolysis bullosa autoantisera in comparison with the monoclonal antibody LH 7.2 provides definitive investigation for the diagnosis of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to substantiate the claim that pityriasis rotunda may be a useful cutaneous marker of hepatocellular carcinoma in South African Blacks, the prevalence of the rash in 63 unselected South African Blacks with this tumour was compared to that in 63 matched patients with active tuberculosis, 63 with other malignant tumours, and 63 with various forms of chronic benign hepatic disease. The prevalence of pityriasis rotunda in hepatocellular carcinoma was 15.9%, which was appreciably greater (P = 0.0005) than the overall prevalence of the rash (2.6%) in the controls. The prevalence was 4.8% for tuberculosis (P = 0.038), 0% for other malignant diseases (P = 0.0007), and 3.2% for chronic benign hepatic disease (P = 0.015). We conclude that the presence of pityriasis rotunda is a useful pointer to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in South African Blacks.\r"

The log quotient of their b-wave amplitudes--that is log of the photopic b-wave amplitude divided by the scotopic b-wave amplitude--was considered to represent the activity of cones relative to rods. The log quotient values had a normal gaussian distribution in the normal control eyes, while they formed two groups in the patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. In the first group (type 1), the scotopic b-wave was non-recordable while the photopic b-wave amplitude was larger than 20 microvolts in all cases, indicating that the log quotient is larger than 0.5 and that the rod system is much more severely affected than the cone system. The second group (type 2) had a log quotient smaller than 0.5 and its distribution almost overlapped the normal one, indicating more symmetrical damage in the cone and rod systems. The mean final rod threshold at 45 minutes for type 1 was significantly higher than that for type 2. The log quotient proved to be a useful index for analysing the cone and rod involvement and consequently provides a better understanding of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.\r"

We reviewed 117 such tumours received in the Department of Pathology, Institute of Ophthalmology, London, in the last 30 years, a number which compared with 2447 basal-cell carcinomas seen over the same period. The hair follicle tumours may be safely excised with a narrow margin of clearance, whereas a macroscopic clearance of 3 to 5 mm or surgery with frozen section histological control is desirable for excision of basal-cell carcinoma. Therefore confirmation by incisional biopsy of the nature of any large lesion suspected of being a basal-cell carcinoma is essential in order to avoid performing an unnecessarily extensive or time consuming excision.\r"

Dosage comparisons of drug responses were obtained by interpolation and yielded the equivalence of one eyedrop to 67 +/- 11 micrograms pilocarpine from the NODS formulation.

It had been discovered with monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between threonine and alanine as the 148th residue of the peptide. Its use as a diagnostic tool has been limited because threonine-containing factor IX (Malmo A) is dominant to alanine-containing factor IX (Malmo B) in immunoassays of plasma; therefore, detection of Malmo heterozygotes is not possible in all instances. A DNA method for recognizing all heterozygotes has been developed, but it also has limitations. We report the development of another DNA procedure based on amplification of the relevant DNA with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method is quick, avoids the use of isotopes and x-ray film, and specifically identifies all the Malmo genotypes: hemizygotes, homozygotes, and heterozygotes. The procedure can be performed satisfactorily on small samples of blood (less than 1 mL) as suggested by Kogan et al (N Engl J Med 317:985, 1987). The method described is applicable to any genetic polymorphism that overlaps a restriction enzyme recognition site.\r"

Numerical changes were found in all patients, most commonly involving chromosomes 5, 9, 15, 18, 22, X, and marker chromosomes. Seven patients also had structural abnormalities. The breakpoints 4q32-34, 6q24, 12q13, 12q23-24, and 13p11-13 were each seen in at least two patients. All but two patients had an admixture of normal cells. Three patients had two or more clones, and one had subclones. No statistically significant correlations between chromosomal abnormalities and clinical characteristics were demonstrated, although the number of patients in each subgroup was small. We conclude that chromosomal studies of Hodgkin's disease are likely to be successful. Additional studies are needed to correlate the karyotypical abnormalities in Hodgkin's disease with clinical and biological characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results in fusion of the bcr gene and c-abl oncogene, which transcribes into two types of chimeric bcr/abl mRNAs: the L-6 junction and the K-28 junction. By means of a highly sensitive assay, combination of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), we analyzed 38 blood samples obtained from 31 patients with Ph'-positive CML and two patients with Ph'-negative bcr rearranged CML. Among the 21 samples obtained in chronic phase, eight patients had the L-6 mRNA, 11 had the K-28 mRNA, and two had both the L-6 and K-28 mRNAs. Among the nine samples obtained in blast crisis, four contained the L-6 mRNA, two contained the K-28 mRNA, and three contained both the K-28 and L-6 mRNAs. This finding supports the concept of alternative splicing of bcr/abl mRNAs transcribed in Ph'-positive CML. However, it appears to be a rare event. Of the eight samples obtained from eight patients who had achieved complete cytogenetic remission and negativity for bcr region rearrangement for 6 months to 3 years after recombinant alpha interferon (r alpha-IFN) therapy, all of them showed evidence of minimal residual Ph'-positive clones as detected by the RT/PCR assay. This finding suggests that interferon therapy suppresses the proliferation of the Ph'-positive clones, but it does not completely eradicate the Ph'-positive stem cells.\r"

  ".U": "89274405\r", 
  ".W": "Hereditary elliptocytosis in North Africa is frequently associated with the alpha I/65 spectrin variant, characterized by an abnormal alpha I 65-kD instead of the normal alpha I 80-kD peptide following limited trypsin digestion of whole spectrin. A similar variant (although it yielded a 68-kD fragment) has been shown recently, in two black patients, to result from the insertion of a leucyl residue at position 148 (Marchesi et al: J Clin Invest 80:191, 1987). In order to determine if the underlying molecular defect was the same in North Africans and blacks (who originate from both sides of the Sahara Desert), we performed analysis directly at the DNA level. Starting from the DNA of an Algerian alpha I/65 heterozygote in whom the mutation was associated with identifiable RFLPs, we cloned and sequenced the alpha-spectrin gene region, which includes the mutation. We thus identified an extra leucine codon (TTG) between codons 147 and 149, the coding sequence becoming CAG TTG TTG CTG instead of CAG TTG CTG. We then used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and dot-blot hybridization of the amplified DNA with mutant and normal allele-specific oligonucleotides to screen the DNA from four other unrelated North African subjects with Sp alpha I/65 hereditary elliptocytosis. In all families we studied, these subjects were heterozygous for the TTG insertion. These results demonstrate that Sp alpha I/65 hereditary elliptocytosis has the same molecular basis in North Africans and blacks.\r"

Anti-Bra can best be detected by a glycoprotein-specific immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies for antigen immobilization (MAIPA assay) and radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP). Recently, we have identified sera from two polytransfused patients that contain an antibody that recognizes Brb, the allele of Bra. Family studies show that both antigens are inherited as autosomal codominant characters. The gene frequency of the new allele Brb is 0.888. Approximately 2,000 anti-Bra binding sites are present on homozygous platelets and 1,000 on heterozygous platelets. Our findings provide evidence for the first polymorphism observed on the glycoprotein Ia/IIa complex. Immunization against these alloantigens is implicated in NAIT and poly-transfused patients.\r"

Digital arteries remained patent in IDDM compared to controls after cold challenge (p = 0.0001), and the difference persisted to a lesser degree 15 min (p = 0.009) and 30 min (p = 0.03) after recovery. Capillary blood flow was reduced in IDDM at room temperature at the finger nailbeds (p less than 0.02) and the palms (p = 0.004) and remained so after warm water immersion in the palms (p = 0.002), where further vasoconstriction was observed immediately after cold water immersion (p less than 0.001) and 15 and 30 min into recovery (p = 0.07 and p = 0.009 respectively). Thermographic analysis confirmed a pattern of predominantly distal rewarming after cold challenge in IDDM with a greater mean index finger temperature than the controls. Together, these features suggested enhanced arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow. All IDDM and IDDM males with LJM had reduced palm capillary flow immediately after cold challenge (p less than 0.05). After warm water (p less than 0.03) and 30 min after cold challenge (p less than 0.05) IDDM males with LJM had reduced palm capillary flow compared to those IDDM without. A microvascular aetiology for LJM is proposed by virtue of reduced nutritional blood flow and evidence of enhanced arteriovenous shunting in the hands of insulin-dependent diabetics.\r"

Within this group, seven developed thrombotic vascular disease, five of whom were associated with an ACA titre of 20,480 or above. Another two with similar high ACA titres developed hyper-reninaemic hypertension, suggesting disease of the renal vasculature and associated ischaemia. Where it was possible to ascertain, seven of eight with high titre ACA developed sclerodactyly.

These arise from measuring a reaction between two IgG molecules and the interference of IgM-RF in the reaction. We compared the prevalence of IgG-RF in whole sera and purified IgG fractions from 58 RA patients (43 of whom were latex or sheep cell agglutination positive). Methods of purification were: ammonium sulphate precipitation and DEAE cellulose or protein A-Sepharose chromatography. IgG-RF was measured by two methods: (1) radioimmunoassay and ELISA with a monoclonal myeloma IgG (IgG4,K) as the antigen and radiolabelled rabbit anti-human IgG (previously absorbed on a column with IgG4,K) as the second antibody; (2) ELISA using rabbit IgG as the antigen and a peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG as the second antibody. When whole sera were assayed, 18 (31%) contained IgG-RF. In contrast, only three of the IgG fractions (5%) were positive for IgG-RF by all methods, while the remainder were uniformly negative. These results suggest that IgG-RF determination in whole sera does not accurately reflect IgG-RF activity.\r"

In comparisons with normal serum IgG antigen, increased rheumatoid factor binding was shown to IgG antigens prepared from synovial fluids from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA).

Only 3 of 11 patients undergoing a second injection had a clinical response to this therapy and 1 developed a vesicovaginal fistula.

Side effects were few (0.3% perforation) and patients tolerated the treatment very well. The general recurrence rate of T1 tumours varied from 33% for primary carcinomas to 54% for recurrent tumours, but the incidence of local recurrence was only 7%. The long-term results of laser treatment showed a decrease in the local recurrence rate when compared with the results of conservative electocautery resection, but there was no significant influence on the total recurrence rate.\r"

  ".W": "Benign prostatic enlargement is a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Recent work has demonstrated the important role played by the sympathetic nervous system in the control of prostatic muscle tone. Although isometric muscle strip studies and clinical trials have highlighted the influence of alpha-1 adrenoceptors, radioisotope ligand binding studies have demonstrated a relatively increased density of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the muscle within prostatic tissue, the significance of which is as yet unexplained. Forty patients entered a study using pharmacological muscle strip experiments, radioligand binding assays and receptor autoradiography. Pharmacological data from these studies confirmed that contraction of prostatic muscle is mediated predominantly by alpha-1 adrenoceptor stimulation, with no evidence of significant alpha-2 adrenoceptor or cholinergic mediated effects. Radioligand binding studies confirmed that there is a higher concentration of alpha-1 binding sites as contrasted to alpha-2 within normal prostate, but that this relationship approaches equity in adenomatous prostate. Autoradiographic localisation demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenoceptor binding is predominant within prostatic stroma with only a small component of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in this compartment. This comprehensive study supports the suggestion that prostatic muscular contraction is controlled by the influence of the sympathetic nervous system acting via alpha-1 adrenoceptors. These findings support the therapeutic use of specific alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\r"

It was observed that there was parallel activation of the anal sphincter, the pelvic floor and the lower limb muscles, voluntary facilitation and marked inhibition during micturition. This method can be used to assess the volitional and the various segmental and suprasegmental influences on the behaviour of the external urethral sphincter. Unfortunately, the poor tolerance of subjects to the scalp sensations caused by the electrical stimulus is a major limitation to its clinical use, though this should be obviated by the introduction of a cortical magnetic stimulator.\r"

The most frequently used combinations were VAB-6 and POMB/ACE. Chemotherapy lasted 3.9 months for small volume disease and 5.5 months for large volume disease. Seven patients (11%) underwent resection of residual masses; viable malignancy was found in only 1 of these. Relapse occurred in 6 complete responders, 3 of whom were salvaged with further chemotherapy. Fifty-three patients are presently alive and have received no treatment for periods of 5 to 86 months. Life table analysis forecasts a survival of 81%. Adverse prognostic factors have been recognised and include high initial serum concentrations of beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), large volume disease and prior irradiation. Although the survival time of patients with advanced disease has improved in recent years, it remains considerably below that of patients who present with less advanced disease. Such patients should be treated aggressively from the outset in order to obtain maximum benefit from chemotherapy. Selected cases also require adjunctive surgery.\r"

Patients with mild bilateral cerebellar dysfunction or mild unilateral dysfunction, and neurologically unimpaired subjects showed increases in response onset time as sequence length increased from L = 1 to L = 3. In contrast to this, there were negligible or no effects of sequence length on response onset time in patients with moderate bilateral cerebellar dysfunction and in patients with moderate unilateral cerebellar dysfunction who responded with the hand ipsilateral to the lesion. Furthermore, cerebellar dysfunction was associated with significantly slower interkeypress reaction times. These results support the hypothesis that the translation of a programmed sequence of responses into action involves cerebellar structures which schedule a sequence of ordered responses before onset of movement.\r"

Tested on admission, and at 3 and 9 months, he could read aloud both orthographically simple and orthographically complex real words, and showed neither semantic errors, preference for nouns, nor difficulty with function words. He could not, however, read aloud orthographically simple nonwords. His disorder thus appears to be the first pure example of 'direct dyslexia', which, in contrast to previously well-documented examples of 'deep' and 'surface' dyslexia, implies the existence in reading of a direct route, independent of phonology or semantics, between visual and oral word representations.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and behavioural features of 5 patients examined during transient global amnesia (TGA) are described. All underwent extensive neuropsychological testing during and sequentially after the attack. Our results show that in TGA there is a characteristic neuropsychological deficit which parallels that in the permanent amnesic syndrome. Personality, complex cognition and problem solving, semantic knowledge, language and visuospatial function remained intact. Immediate memory was preserved. Longer-term verbal and nonverbal memory was severely disrupted in all cases. In contrast, the extent of retrograde amnesia was highly variable. A famous faces test showed an extensive deficit in 3 cases, with improvement in all cases following the attack. Analysis of group data confirmed the presence of a reversible temporal gradient, in that more distant memories were relatively spared. On a famous events test, recognition was normal across all decades, but dating of events from the 1960s and 1970s was consistently impaired. The Crovitz test of remote personal episodic memory was given to 3 subjects; all showed impaired uncued autobiographical memory and in contrast to normal controls, had a virtual absence of recent memories. During recovery from TGA there was progressive shrinkage of retrograde amnesia but a permanent short retrograde gap of around 1 h remained in all cases. Although subjectively normal within 24 h, all cases demonstrated persisting impairment of new learning for at least a week post-TGA. The relevance of the neuropsychological data to theories concerning the amnesic syndrome is discussed. We postulate a temporary deficit in retrieval of remote memories which appears to be dissociable from the anterograde amnesia.\r"

  ".W": "A patient suffering from an acquired painful syndrome, due to injury to primary somatic afferent units, was studied. Clinical features included chronic spontaneous burning pain in one hand, abnormal painful response to nonnoxious cutaneous stimuli, and deviation of temperature and dystrophic changes in symptomatic skin. Diagnostic stellate ganglion blocks did not improve spontaneous or stimulus-induced pains, and observation of sympathetic efferent neural activity and vasomotor effector responses revealed no abnormality, failing to support an autonomic contribution to the pathogenesis of the pains. A quantitative psychophysical assessment documented exaggerated magnitude of pain in response to noxious stimuli in symptomatic skin, together with abnormal painful quality and prolongation of sensation induced by nonnoxious tactile or warm stimuli. Such mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia persisted during A fibre blocks, suggesting transmission by primary afferents with unmyelinated C fibres and implying sensitization of C polymodal nociceptors. Direct microneurographic recordings of single, identified C polymodal nociceptors from symptomatic skin confirmed the presence of units with pathologically enhanced receptor responses: lowered threshold and very prolonged afterdischarges. While bypassing skin receptors, strongly intraneural microstimulation in fascicles supplying symptomatic or control skin evoked equivalent magnitudes and temporal profiles of pain from both sides. Thus secondary CNS dysfunction need not be postulated to explain the painful syndrome. Skin grafted onto the affected region partially recovered tactile and thermal sensation (but not pain) without expressing the painful syndrome. This supports the overall conclusion that in this patient A fibres are not involved as primary carriers of input decoded as pain. Sensitization of C polymodal nociceptors is consistent with the features of hyperalgesia in this patient: pain evoked by nonnoxious stimuli, exaggerated pain magnitude, and abnormally prolonged aftersensation of pain. This is the first documentation of chronic sensitization of human C polymodal nociceptors as a symptom of disease. In the context of sensitized C nociceptors and in the absence of sympathetic vasoconstrictor deficit, the abnormally elevated temperature in symptomatic skin is interpreted as due to antidromic vasodilatation triggered by neurosecretion from hyperactive nociceptors. This study calls for reexamination of concepts relating to hyperalgesia as a sequel of injury to the peripheral nervous system, and to reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and presents pathophysiological data on a particular variety of neuropathic painf\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were undertaken to study the effect on voluntary movement of an electrical or magnetic stimulus delivered to the brain through the scalp. Subjects were trained to flex or extend their wrist rapidly in response to an auditory tone. A single brain stimulus (electrical or magnetic) delivered after the tone and before the usual time of onset of the voluntary reaction could delay the execution of the movement for up to 150 ms, without affecting the pattern of the agonist and antagonist EMG bursts. The delay increased with increasing stimulus intensity and with stimuli which were applied nearer to the usual time of onset of the voluntary reaction. A stimulus given after the onset of the first voluntary agonist EMG burst only delayed the onset of the first antagonist and later EMG bursts. Movement was not delayed when similar experiments were performed with supramaximal stimulation of the median nerve instead of the brain stimulus. The delay following a cortical shock was not due to spinal motoneurons being inaccessible to descending input during the delay period since a second brain stimulus, given in the middle of the delay period, was capable of producing a direct muscle response. Neither could the delay be explained by the brain stimulus altering the time of the subject's intention to respond since a stimulus delivered to one hemisphere before an attempted simultaneous bilateral wrist movement produced a far greater delay of the contralateral than the ipsilateral movement. We suggest that the brain stimulus delayed movement by inhibiting a group of strategically placed neurons in the brain (probably in the motor cortex) which made them unresponsive for a brief period to the command signals they receive which initiate the motor program of agonist and antagonist muscle activity. The results have implications for the issues of the storage of motor programs, internal monitoring of central movement commands and the site of organization of the antagonist EMG burst.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study transient paresis, force and surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from the biceps brachii in 3 patients with recessive myotonia congenita, in 8 with myotonic dystrophy and in 3 controls. Epochs of 0.34 s EMG signal were stored every 0.44 s and processed to determine the integrated EMG (IEMG), the power spectrum and the average muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV). The protocol consisted of 5 maximal voluntary contractions lasting 10.3 s and 13 s recovery. During the first 1-1.5 s the MFCV and median frequency (Fmed) of the power spectra of the controls increased (mean increase 12.5% and 14%, respectively) in all 5 consecutive contractions. Subsequently, MFCV, Fmed and force declined as a consequence of fatigue. Both the initial force and MFCV declined with successive contractions. The results in myotonic dystrophy were not different from the controls, except that the changes during fatigue were far less pronounced. These events are the reverse of the changes found in myotonia congenita in which an initial loss of force (maximal by 61-79%) and a decline of the IEMG (maximal by 79-92%) was found during the first contraction. This transient paresis was accompanied by a dramatic fall in the MFCV concomitant with a shift of the power spectrum to the lower frequencies. The first MFCV measurement of the 5 contractions was always normal. The decline in MFCV was maximal after 1.5-2.5 s and varied for the 3 patients from 32-52%. In general, the decline in force, IEMG and MFCV lessened with each successive contraction (warming-up phenomenon), though sudden deteriorations were sometimes observed during later contractions. The same results were found for brachioradialis and abductor digiti minimi. The results provide evidence that transient paresis is of clinical relevance in myotonia congenita and that it is caused by alterations in the muscle membrane. These membrane changes result in a strong decline of the muscle action potential conduction velocity and consequent depolarization block of the muscle fibres. Our method did not show the presence of transient paresis during voluntary contraction in myotonic dystrophy.\r"

Similar findings were seen in 2 patients with symptomatic hemidystonia in whom structural brain lesions were present. However, this reduction in presynaptic inhibition was not specific to patients with dystonia. In a further group of 13 patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia due to stroke, abnormalities of both early and later phases of reciprocal inhibition were found. The patients with spasticity exhibited less disynaptic inhibition than those with normal tone or flaccid limbs. The changes in the presynaptic phase of reciprocal inhibition did not correlate with the clinical signs of spasticity and increased muscle tone. These results provide objective evidence of a physiological basis for the action or task-specific focal dystonias such as writer's cramp.\r"

One or more vacuoles containing membranous material, groups of atrophic fibres, and an autoaggressive endomysial inflammatory exudate occurred in 100, 96 and 92% of the muscle specimens. All three of these features were present in 88% of the specimens. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of filamentous inclusions in 40 of 43 patients. The inclusions are typically near vacuoles and a minimum of three vacuolated fibres must be scrutinized to detect them with confidence. There is no electromyographic pattern that can reliably distinguish IBM from other inflammatory myopathies. The typical clinical features in the patients diagnosed by histological criteria as IBM were: insidious onset after age 50 yrs with painless, proximal lower extremity weakness; slow but relentless progression with selectively severe involvement of quadriceps, iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, biceps and triceps muscles; relatively early depression of the knee reflexes; and a normal or mildly elevated serum creatine kinase level. The male: female ratio was 3:1. Distal weakness occurred in about 50%, but only in 35% was it as great or greater than proximal weakness. Significant associated illnesses include other autoimmune disorders (15%), diabetes mellitus (20%), and diffuse peripheral neuropathy (18%). Prednisone treatment at dose levels frequently effective in polymyositis failed to prevent disease progression in those patients observed for 2 or more years. Our findings support the notion that IBM is a distinct entity in which a set of pathological features is associated with a constellation of clinical findings.\r"

The hypothesis put forward by Penrose in 1948 that 'anticipation' is caused by bias of index case selection was based on theoretical arguments only and has not been supported by clinical observations. This hypothesis was tested in a clinical and genetic study of 14 families with myotonic dystrophy. Excluding index patients, an earlier onset in the child was found in 98% of 61 parent-child pairs. A greater mean difference in age of onset was found with transmission via the father than via the mother. The comparison of the severity of the disease between parents and children was difficult because of the variation in symptoms but, in general, the disease was more severe in the child than in the parent. The penetrance of the abnormal gene was nearly complete in the 14 families combined, leaving little room for the observation of 'complementary' parent-child pairs in the future. Also in retrospect no complementary parent-child pairs were found in the first generations. Fertility was severely reduced only in the very early onset patient group and this selective infertility cannot be responsible for the total amount of anticipation observed. It is therefore concluded that anticipation may be inherent in the transmission of myotonic dystrophy. This has important consequences for genetic counselling.\r"

A 12-item test of hand preference was used as an index of the pattern of interhemispheric functional asymmetry. Callosal size was analysed for two factors: hand preference, classified as consistent-right-hand preference (CRH) versus non consistent-right-hand preference, and sex. The group of nCRH (n = 18) was found to have a larger overall callosal area, with the greatest difference occurring in the posterior body segments, especially the isthmus. The isthmus probably includes interhemispheric fibres from posterior parietal and superior temporal cortex which involves cortical regions related to functional asymmetry. The results of variation in callosal morphology are discussed as part of a possible substrate of functional asymmetry and due to variation in axonal elimination in early brain development. Sex differences were found in several aspects of callosal anatomy. (1) The difference between hand groups in the posterior body occurred in interaction with sex:handedness was a factor in callosal size in males (n = 15), but not in females (n = 35). This result is consistent with the general hypothesis of females having less clear lateralization than males. (2) Females did not have a larger overall callosum or a larger splenium, either in absolute size or size proportional to brain weight. The latter measure was considered since callosal area correlated with cerebrum weight (r = 0.48). In contrast, female of both hand groups were found to have a larger proportional isthmus compared to CRH males. (3) Of all callosal regions, only the genu and a part of the anterior body were found to be larger in absolute size in males than females. (4) Callosal size decreased with chronological age in males, but not in females.\r"

  ".W": "Questionnaires were administered to 108 university psychology students to investigate attitudes and behaviour related to organ donation. Three groups (committed, uncommitted and opposed) were identified. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that, compared with uncommitted donors, committed donors felt better informed about organ donation, had discussed donation more often with family members and knew more people who had signed donor cards. The subjects in the opposed group and those in the uncommitted group cited different reasons for not signing a donor card. Empathy, religious beliefs and attitudes about death did not affect willingness to donate. Analyses of the interaction between willingness to donate one's own organs and willingness to donate those of a family member revealed a monotonic increase in willingness to donate the organs of a family member as the type of recipient became more personally relevant. Our findings indicate that when health care professionals request donor organs the potential recipients must be presented to the potential donors in a personally relevant manner. Educational programs must be developed to train medical personnel in how to effectively ask for organs without coercing the potential donor or invading the privacy of the potential recipient.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a telephone survey of 102 randomly selected Ottawa family physicians to determine their attitudes and practices regarding the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Of the 102, 56% routinely measured serum cholesterol levels in all their patients over the age of 30 years, and 24% did so for patients in more restricted age ranges. The level at which they started dietary therapy averaged 6.95 mmol/L (270 mg/dl); for 25% it was less than 6.22 mmol/L (240 mg/dl). The level at which they started drug therapy averaged 8.9 mmol/L (345 mg/dl); for only 15% was it 7.23 mmol/L (280 mg/dl) or less. Two-thirds were unable to give numerical values to the serum cholesterol levels at which they started diet therapy, and 38% used the upper limits of laboratory normal values as an indication to start therapy. Our findings contrast markedly with results reported for US family physicians, who treat hypercholesterolemia much more aggressively. The variability in practices must be addressed if public campaigns to lower serum cholesterol levels are to be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "We analysed physician fee-for-service use in British Columbia from 1974-75 to 1985-86. Over the study period use increased by 5.3% per year. This can be factored into increases attributable to changes in the age structure of the population (0.4% per year), general population growth (1.8%, for a combined annual \"population effect\" of 2.2%) and age-specific increases in per-capita use (3% per year). The average annual increase for people aged 75 years or more was 5.5% per capita. The area with the fastest growth in use by the elderly was specialist care, particularly diagnostic services. The average number of specialists seen by people aged 75 years or more doubled over the study period. Our results suggest that increased per-capita use among the elderly that is unrelated to aging of the population should be the main focus of future policy attention. Additional analyses are needed to determine the underlying dynamics of this dramatic increase in rates of use among the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "The therapeutic indications in prostatic cancer depend on the regional and distant extension of the cancer and are difficult to assess before lymphadenectomy. Radioimmunodetection of lymph node involvement with monoclonal anti-prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) antibodies can be proposed as a noninvasive alternative to lymphadenectomy. Fifteen patients with various stages of histologically proven prostatic cancer were examined by immunolymphoscintigraphy (ILS) before treatment to detect lymph node metastases. These patients had Stage A (n = 7), Stage B (n = 3), Stage C (n = 2), and Stage D (n = 3) tumors. They received between 100 and 400 micrograms of monoclonal antibody 227 A in the form of F(ab')2 fragments labeled with iodine 123 (123I). The antibody was injected directly into the periprostatic area. ILS images were obtained after 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours. Three days later, each patient underwent a lymphadenectomy for histologic examination. The results of the histologic examination and ILS were compared. In ten patients, the examination did not show any images capable of being interpreted as lymphadenopathy and histologic examination confirmed the integrity of the nodes examined. In five cases, scintigraphy suggested the presence of lymph node invasion by prostatic cancer and this was confirmed by histologic examination in three of the five cases. Overall, in terms of lymphadenopathy, this examination had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 83%. Therefore, ILS appears to be capable of detecting lymph node metastases in prostatic cancer.\r"

The mean BrdU LI +/- SD of HCC cancerous portion, HCC non-cancerous cirrhotic portion, control LC, and of control subjects were 7.2 +/- 2.9%, 3.3 +/- 1.5%, 2.1 +/- 1.7%, and 0.25 +/- 0.09%, respectively. Interesting enough, there was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between the non-cancerous cirrhotic portion and control LC. Although all 17 non-cancerous cirrhotic portion belonged to the high LI group (greater than or equal to 1.5%), 10 of 19 in the control LC belonged to the low LI group (less than 1.5%) (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that HCC would develop in the cirrhotics with high DNA synthetic potency.\r"

All patients had disseminated tumor equivalent to ovarian Stage III and IV disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) and with predominantly high-grade neoplasms. They were managed by surgical exploration, tumor debulking where possible, and postoperative chemotherapy. A comparison with a contemporaneous series of 139 patients with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma matched for stage and grade of disease and managed similarly showed no difference in actuarial survival. The median survival times were 11.3 months for patients with extraovarian serous papillary carcinomas and 13.5 months for patients with equivalent primary ovarian neoplasms. The features of the disease and the treatment regimens used are discussed.\r"

Both total carotenoids and beta carotene levels were lower in the 66 lung cancer cases than in their matched controls. For all cancer deaths combined, there were no significant differences in total carotenoids or beta carotene between cases and controls. The relationship between lower serum carotenoid levels and lung cancer persisted after adjusting for the number of cigarettes, alcohol intake, serum thiocyanate levels, and cholesterol levels in the blood. Serum levels of retinol, alpha tocopherol, and retinol-binding protein were not related to any cancer site. The results of this study provide further evidence for a possible protective effect of beta carotene against lung cancer among cigarette smokers.\r"

Tumor specimens from 241 patients were re-examined with regard to calcitonin immunoreactivity, amyloid content, argyrophil reaction, tumor capsule condition, and nuclear DNA content. In univariate analyses, these factors, with the exception of the argyrophil reaction, were strong predictors of survival. There were twofold-to-threefold differences in hazard rate between patients with a high (greater than 50%) and low (less than 10%) frequency of calcitonin-immunoreactive tumor cells, between those with amyloid-containing and amyloid-free tumors, and between those with an intact and a nonintact tumor capsule. Calcitonin immunoreactivity and the amyloid content also provided prognostic information in multivariate analyses that adjusted for all the other factors mentioned above and in the full multivariate model, which in addition considered age, sex, heredity, stage of the disease, tumor size, and treatment. The strong prognostic capacity of the nuclear DNA content found in univariate analyses became considerably weaker when other morphologic characteristics were considered.\r"

Cancer recurred or progressed in a previously untreated area in 35 patients; for the 29 affected above the clavicles, the median time to manifestation was 9.9 months. A Cox model with four risk factors (P less than 0.05) was found to predict failure above the clavicles: lymph node metastasis in the laryngectomy specimen (Delphian, pretracheal, tracheoesophageal, parathyroid), primary tumor more than 1.5 cm in greatest diameter, subglottic extension, and lymph node metastasis in the neck dissection specimen. A simple risk score computed from the Cox model shows that the more factors present, the higher the risk of disease progression or recurrence.\r"

There were 54 responders (51%) to oophorectomy, with a median duration of response of 16 months (range, 3 to 129 months). Thirty of 42 (71%) estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients responded to oophorectomy versus five of 24 (21%) ER-negative patients (P less than 0.001). Of the 39 patients with unknown ER status, 19 (49%) responded to oophorectomy. Osseous, soft tissue, and pulmonary metastases responded at similar rates. Of the 16 patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy, there were five responders (31%) to oophorectomy. Second-line endocrine therapy was effective in 29 of 53 (55%) patients. Fifteen of 28 (54%) ER-positive patients responded to second-line endocrine therapy while two of six (33%) ER-negative patients responded. Twenty-three of 37 (62%) oophorectomy responders responded to second-line endocrine therapy versus six of 16 (38) nonresponders. Oophorectomy appears to be a valuable palliative treatment for metastatic breast cancer. ER-positive patients have the best chance of responding to this therapy. However, ER-negative patients have a reduced but definite chance of responding with a good duration of response. Response to further endocrine treatments is predicted by response to oophorectomy and to a lesser degree by ER status.\r"

In 37% of cases, the papilla was normal endoscopically and the tumor was detected only after sphincterotomy. Destruction of adenomas by snare resection, laser photoradiation, or both after sphincterotomy was attempted in 11 patients. Subsequent biopsies revealed persistence or recurrence of adenomatous tissue in only one case and complete destruction of adenomas, with a mean duration of follow-up of 39 months, in the 10 other cases. Palliative treatment by endoscopic procedures was performed in 21 patients and was effective for a mean of 45 months for adenomas and for a mean of 6 months for adenocarcinomas, with a mortality of 10%. To avoid repeated sphincterotomy in patients requiring palliative treatment, the data support the early use of endobiliary prostheses. Endoscopic palliative treatment is not indicated, however, for infiltrative tumors that can induce rapid duodenal obstruction.\r"

Women with cytologic evidence of papillomavirus infection and a comparison group of women with cytologic evidence of Trichomonas infection were identified from a reexamination of cervicovaginal smears initially evaluated between 1973 and 1981 in a private pathology laboratory. To identify subsequent CIN among these women the authors reviewed records of private obstetric and gynecology practices and public clinics through 1983. After accounting for possible confounding variables, including age, marital status, frequency of cervical cytologic examination, and selected characteristics of pregnancy history, a 2.7-fold increase in the rate of CIN was found among the 613 women with prior papillomavirus infection compared to the 410 women with previous Trichomomas infection. The rate ratio was higher among women with more severe cervical neoplasia than for those with less severe neoplasia and for those followed for greater than 12 months than for those followed 7 to 12 months. The results of this study provide further evidence of the role of papillomavirus in the etiology of cervical cancer.\r"

Cancer incidence among the SNI is compared with cancer incidence patterns in NYS using age and sex standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Decreased cancer incidence was observed for all sites combined with SNI males exhibiting 64% of expected incidence and females exhibiting 53% of expected incidence. Although incidence deficits were observed for several sites, cancer incidence was not significantly elevated for any cancer site.

For 171 Israeli women diagnosed with breast cancer in 1976 to 1979, tumor hormone receptor status (positive if greater than 20 fmol receptors/mg protein; negative if less than or equal to 20 fmol/mg) and survival as of April 1984 were ascertained. There were 77 ER- versus 94 ER+ and (for 134 PR analyses) 69 PR- versus 65 PR+. Although ER status and PR status were found to be highly positively related, the epidemiologic features of women with an ER+ tumor were different from those with a PR+ tumor. Age tended to be associated positively with both ER+ and PR+. Being postmenopausal, older at menopause or at first birth, nulliparous, having more years of schooling, and a higher body mass index for older women or a lower body mass index for younger women were correlated positively with ER and negatively with PR. Among women with Stage III or IV tumors at diagnosis significant differences existed: restricted mean survival for follow-up time was 47.2 months for ER-, 73.8 months for ER+, 45.8 months for PR-, and 61.9 months for PR+. The combined hormone effects on survival at Stages III to IV showed a similar trend: restricted mean survival of 38.4 months for ER-PR-, intermediate survival with one positive hormone receptor status, and 74.6 months for ER+PR+.\r"

Numerous attempts to discern an important clinical difference between the subtypes have failed to provide a convincing reason to maintain this distinction for other than descriptive purposes. Because of conflicting reports in the literature, the authors have analyzed 183 cases of SNC NHL in children from the Pediatric Oncology Group and 129 from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). The results from both series, which consist of approximately the same proportions of B and NB subtypes, (i.e., approximately 54%-58% B, 36% NB, and 6%-10% not otherwise specified) show no significant differences in age at presentation, extent of disease, primary site of involvement, or survival. The authors conclude that the morphologic distinction between B and NB types of SNC NHL in children lacks demonstrable clinical importance.\r"

Patients were treated between March 1965 and April 1985; there was a minimum 2-year follow-up. Most of the patients in this study had clinical Stage III (28%) or IV (68%) disease. The actuarial survival rates were 51.5% at 2 years, 31.4% at 5 years, and 18.9% at 10 years. The rates of disease control above the clavicles at 5 years (actuarial method) as a function of modified AJCC stage were as follows: 100% for Stage II, 70.5% for Stage III, 44.8% for Stage IVA, and 45.7% for Stage IVB. T stage, N stage, neck node status (number, size, and fixation), and the pathology of the surgical specimen (tumor in the specimen, surgical margin positive, number of metastatic nodes, and presence of extracapsular extension) were important prognostic factors. The interval, between radiotherapy and surgery, and primary site (oral cavity vs. other sites) were not important prognostic factors. The rate of moderate-to-severe complications was 33.9% including eight patients who developed lethal complications after treatment. The influence of the radiation course, dose, and other factors on control of disease above the clavicles and on complications is presented.\r"

A cell line producing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) has been established from pleural effusion of the pulmonary metastatic tumor. Cytogenetic analysis disclosed a reciprocal translocation (11;22)(q24;q12). Additionally, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that CEA, NSE, vimentin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigens are positive, but desmin and S-100 protein are negative. Although neurofilament was negative in the pulmonary metastatic tumor cells, it became positive in cell line in vitro. These results suggest that this tumor may be derived from the primitive and pluripotential cells, differentiating into mesenchymal, epithelial, and neural features in variable proportions.\r"

  ".U": "89274993\r", 
  ".W": "The predictive value of estrogen receptor (ER) level for response to chemotherapy was studied in 182 patients with metastatic breast cancer in a prospective study. Patients were stratified according to ER status and dominant site of disease and randomized to one of three regimens: cyclophosphamide, 5-Fluorouracil, and prednisone (CFP) versus CFP, methotrexate, and vincristine (CFPMV) versus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). There was no significant differences in all response categories (P = 0.21), was taken as a predictor for response to chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall response (P = 0.61) between ER+ (62/108, 57%) and ER- patients (31/49, 63%). However, there was a significant trend toward a higher degree of response in ER- patients (more complete response [CR] nine of 49, 18%, and fewer failures six of 49, 12%) than in ER+ (less CR seven of 108, 7%, and more failures 37/108, 34%) (P = 0.006). Patients with higher measured levels of ER showed worse response (Kendall's tau C, P = 0.026). This trend for ER- patients to have better response than ER+ patients was generally consistent, regardless of the predominant site of metastases or chemotherapy regimen (P = 0.04 for CFP; P = 0.08 for CFPMV; and P = 0.20 for AC). The advantage of a better response for ER- patients was nullified by an earlier relapse which was reflected in longer duration of remission, time to treatment failure, and survival in favor of ER+ patients (12.3 months versus 7.3 months remission duration, 18.7 months versus 13.6 months survival in partial responders). These data suggest that ER- patients respond to a higher extent to chemotherapy but relapse sooner than ER+ patients, suggesting a more rapid growth for ER- tumors. In patients with ER- tumors and poorer prognosis on conventional chemotherapy, new trials of intensive consolidation after response should be considered.\r"

The patient's leukemic cells were mature, medium-sized lymphocytes with sparse azurophil granules and the surface phenotypes of the cells were CD2+, CD3-, CD11+, and CD16+. Molecular analysis showed a germ line configuration in both T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and T-cell receptor tau-chain genes. A clonal anomaly of chromosome (trisomy 8) was demonstrated in peripheral blood cells. LGL after acute transformation of the disease displayed large blastic morphology with prominent nucleoli, intense basophilic cytoplasm, and numerous granules. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a mosaic of trisomy 8 and trisomy 8 with an additional marker chromosome. Thus, transformation of chronic LGL leukemia into an acute or aggressive form in this patient was associated with morphologic and karyotypic changes of the leukemic cells. Patients with a stable form of chronic LGL leukemia should be examined carefully for the possible acute crisis associated with a clonal evolution.\r"

The patients could be divided into the following two groups: (1) those with progressive disease (n = 17) or (2) those showing improvement during therapy (complete remission [n = 2], partial remission, or no change [n = 18]). On admission to the hospital, the patients with progressive disease showed significantly higher initial serum hyaluronan levels (median value, 250 micrograms/l) than those in the second group (median value, 97 micrograms/l) (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon). Serum hyaluronan as a predictor of progressive disease has a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 85%. There was a significant increase in serum hyaluronan levels during treatment in patients with progression (P less than 0.01). In three patients with initially high levels there was a clear decrease in parallel with the reduction in tumor burden. In the remaining patients of the responder group, the values were constantly low. There was no significant correlation between the hyaluronan level and any other laboratory test performed on blood samples. Pleural fluid was removed for medical reasons from 13 patients. Neither the presence of pleural fluid nor its hyaluronan level were correlated to the progression of the disease. However, there was an interesting negative correlation between serum and pleural hyaluronan levels, indicating that an elevated serum hyaluronan level does not reflect high production in the pleural cavity.\r"

One hundred seventy (68%) specimens displayed oat cell features (including 30 with mixed oat cell/intermediate cell features), 66 (27%) displayed intermediate cell features, and 13 (5%) displayed mixed small cell/large cell features. No differences among these subtypes were found with respect to stage of disease, sex, age, performance status, and number and distribution of metastases. Complete and partial remission rates for the oat cell-type were, respectively, 31% and 38%, for the intermediate cell-type 20% and 45%, and for the small cell/large cell-type 38% and 31%. Two-year survival rates were 7%, 11%, and 15%, respectively. These data were all statistically insignificant, and comparisons of log-rank analyses of survival curves for these SCLC subtypes also showed no statistically significant differences. We thus conclude that histologic subtypes of SCLC are not distinct entities of clinical relevance, and that prognostic as well as therapeutic decisions cannot be based on histologic subtyping.\r"

Karyometric measurements, including total nuclear DNA content, nuclear area, and nuclear roundness were compared with various clinical and histologic variables. Nearly all tumors (30 of 31) were aneuploid. Tumors with nuclear areas greater than 70 microns2 were associated with transmural esophageal penetration (P less than 0.05) and to a lesser extent with poor survival (less than 6 months; P = 0.06). Surprisingly, nuclear ploidy did not correlate with either variable. These data support a role for nuclear analysis on preoperative biopsy specimens as an adjunct in clinical staging.\r"

As control, those of a tumor line without both receptors (ES-13) derived from human esophageal cancer were used. The growth rates of transplanted tumors were estimated up to 5 weeks. The tumor growth of ES-8 line was significantly greater in males than it was in females. Such a difference was not observed for ES-13 line. Moreover, in order to investigate the effect of estrogen on the ER, tumor tissues of ES-8 line were transplanted in six oophorectomized female mice, and next, estradiol (E2) (500 micrograms/kg, 50 micrograms/kg, or none) was administered to five transplanted female mice of each group, respectively. The growth rates of tumors were enhanced in oophorectomized female mice, and significantly suppressed with the physiologic dose (50 micrograms/kg) of E2 compared to the control. The current results seem to indicate that the inhibitory effect of estrogen on the tumor line is mediated by ER.\r"

The criteria used to select cases were as follows: (1) a size greater than 3 cm, (2) an intraluminal polypoid or pedunclated tumor, and (3) absence of wall construction and ulceration. Four of the seven polypoid cases have survived more than 5 years. One has lived more than 3 years. The 5-year survival rate of those patients with the polypoid type was 71%, but it was only 11% for the other types (P less than 0.05). Age, sex, size or location of the tumor, histologic grade, or lymph node metastasis did not affect survival. Only the incidence of adventitial involvement was significantly lower for the polypoid type.

In contrast to symptomatic gallbladder carcinomas, all of which were classified as Stage III (9.3%) or Stage IV (90.7%) disease, 80.0% of asymptomatic cases were classified as Stage 0 (13.3%), I (20.0%), or II (46.7%). Histologically, all the symptomatic cases of gallbladder carcinoma had invasion to the serosal or subserosal layer of the gallbladder as well as to the hepatoduodenal ligament. Lymphatic and hematogenous metastases of the symptomatic carcinomas were found in 94.4% and 64.8%, respectively. On the other hand, the carcinoma in the asymptomatic group was retained in the mucosal layer (M) in four cases, in the muscular layer (MUS) in one case, in the subserosal layer (SS) in nine cases (INF beta in seven cases and INF r in two in the mode of infiltration), and in the serosa (SE) in one case. However, cancerous invasion to the hepatoduodenal ligament or lymphatic metastasis was found in only two cases, whereas hematogenous metastasis was not found in any of them. Cancerous extension beyond the gallbladder wall was apparently rare in the cases of SS invasion, as well as in those of M or MUS invasion. It was suggested that, for radical resection of gallbladder carcinoma, it is very important to find it in an asymptomatic stage.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of changes in receptor density and the considerable interindividual variability in the response to beta-adrenergic antagonists, we determined the relationship between the beta-blockade produced by propranolol and the beta-adrenergic receptor density (Bmax) in 16 healthy subjects who received 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg propranolol every 8 hours for 1 day at each dosage level. The extent of beta-blockade produced was assessed as the reduction in exercise tachycardia. The extent of beta-blockade correlated with pretreatment lymphocyte Bmax (30 mg/day: r = 0.6290, p less than 0.05; 60 mg/day: r = 0.5279, p less than 0.05; 120 mg/day: r = 0.5888, p less than 0.01; 240 mg/day: r = 0.6783, p less than 0.005). When the extent of beta-blockade was corrected for plasma propranolol concentrations, the correlation was further improved (30 mg/day: r = 0.7636, p less than 0.001; 60 mg/day: r = 0.7218, p less than 0.002; 120 mg/day: r = 0.7814, p less than 0.001; 240 mg/day: r = 0.6899, p less than 0.005). We conclude that the density of beta-adrenergic receptors is one of the principal factors that control beta-receptor response to antagonists in human beings.\r"

Serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and its three metabolites--desethylene ciprofloxacin (M1), sulfociprofloxacin (M2), and oxociprofloxacin (M3)--were measured by an HPLC procedure. The pharmacokinetic parameters for ciprofloxacin were not significantly altered in cirrhotic patients. The elimination half-life (t 1/2) and the area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) were, respectively, 3.71 hours and 16.18 microgram.ml-1.hr-1 in the normal subjects and 3.47 hours and 18.38 micrograms.ml-1.hr-1 in patients with cirrhosis. The formation of oxociprofloxacin was reduced by approximately one half in the cirrhotic subjects, as the Cmax was 0.29 micrograms/ml in normal subjects versus 0.14 micrograms/ml in cirrhotic patients and the mean AUC(0-t) was 1.54 micrograms.ml-1.hr-1 in normal subjects versus 0.70 micrograms.ml-1.hr-1 in cirrhotic patients. However, there appeared to be no significant difference between groups with respect to desethylene ciprofloxacin and sulfociprofloxacin. Therefore it appears from this study that no dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.\r"

Propranolol was tested as the reference drug in a randomized double-blind trial. Of the 35 patients of both sexes who completed the study, 17 were hyperlipidemic (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than or equal to 170 mg/dl) and 18 were normolipidemic. Both drugs exerted a similar hypotensive effect after gradual dose adjustment; however, propranolol reduced heart rate to a higher extent (-20.5%) than celiprolol (-7.7%). Propranolol determined a significant rise of total and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) associated triglyceridemia, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) levels and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios were significantly depressed, particularly in hyperlipidemic patients. Celiprolol, in contrast, slightly decreased triglyceridemia (significantly in the hyperlipidemic group at week 12) and caused a 5% increase of the HDL cholesterol levels. The total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was reduced by celiprolol at week 16 in both hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic patients. The effects of the two beta-adrenoceptor blockers on HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels differed significantly after 12 and 16 weeks of treatment, which confirm the divergent metabolic effects of the two agents.\r"

The plasma AUCs of idarubicin and idarubicinol varied between patients but were fairly constant in individual patients. The sum of the plasma AUCs was lower in patients with rapid progression than in patients who responded to treatment. A correlation between this parameter and the relative decrease in the leukocyte counts was demonstrated (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between the pharmacokinetic parameters and the time to final progression.\r"

The plasma levels and the AUC of unconjugated (-)E-10-OH-NT were two to five times higher than those of (+)E-10-OH-NT. The plasma half-lives of both enantiomers were 8 to 9 hours. A significantly higher proportion of the given dose of (+)E-10-OH-NT (64.4% +/- 12.1%) than of (-)E-10-OH-NT (35.3% +/- 9.7%) was recovered in urine as glucuronide conjugate, but more (-)E-10-OH-NT was recovered unchanged in urine. The total oral plasma clearance and the metabolic clearance by glucuronidation were significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher for (+)E-10-OH-NT than for (-)E-10-OH-NT. The findings indicate that first-pass glucuronidation of E-10-OH-NT is enantioselective in human beings in vivo, with preference for (+)E-10-OH-NT. The renal clearance of unbound (-)E-10-OH-NT (0.57 +/- 0.16 L.kg-1.hr-1), on the other hand, exceeded that of (+)E-10-OH-NT (0.44 +/- 0.14 L.kg-1.hr-1) (p less than 0.005), which suggests enantioselective tubular secretion. The debrisoquin hydroxylation status was not associated with any of the investigated kinetic processes that relate to E-10-OH-NT.\r"

Plasma disappearance half-life of diltiazem increased similarly and significantly in both groups with long-term dosing (young: rapid intravenous, 3.7 +/- 0.8 hour; long-term oral, 6.3 +/- 1 hour [mean +/- SE]; elderly: rapid intravenous, 3.8 +/- 0.7 hour; long-term oral, 7.2 +/- 2.1 hour; p less than 0.01). During long-term therapy both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lowered from baseline beyond a 12-hour dose interval, with greater decreases in systolic blood pressure in the elderly. Heart rate was decreased with long-term therapy in both groups. Maximal prolongation of PR interval was greater in the young after the intravenous dose (young: 46 +/- 28 msec; elderly: 24 +/- 11 msec; p less than .01), but this effect was not seen with long-term therapy. These data demonstrate that diltiazem administered every 12 hours is an effective antihypertensive agent in both young and elderly patients.\r"

Systolic toe blood pressure was measured with a strain-gauge technique, and ankle pressure was measured with strain-gauge or Doppler techniques. Wound healing was defined as intact skin for at least 6 mo. One hundred ninety-seven patients healed primarily, 77 had amputations, and 40 died before healing had occurred. In 294 of 300 patients, it was possible to measure either ankle or toe pressure. Fourteen patients were not available for pressure measurements. Of these, 10 patients healed primarily, and 4 died before healing occurred. Both ankle and toe pressures were higher (P less than .001) among patients who healed without amputation compared with those who underwent amputation or died before healing. No differences were seen in ankle or toe pressure levels among those who had amputations or died. No patient healed primarily with an ankle pressure less than 40 mmHg. An upper limit above which amputation was not required could not be defined. Primary healing was achieved in 139 of 164 patients (85%) with a toe pressure level greater than 45 mmHg, whereas 43 of 117 patients (36%; P less than .001) healed without amputation when toe pressure was less than or equal to 45 mmHg. In conclusion, a combination of ankle and toe pressure measurements is a useful tool to predict primary healing in diabetic foot ulcers.\r"

The reproducibility of AlbuSure results was also evaluated. The results of these evaluations were examined by three different types of urine collections (24 h, overnight, and timed postclinic) and overall. AlbuSure's validity was examined by comparing its results to immunonephelometrically measured concentrations and AER. When compared to albumin concentration, AlbuSure had an overall sensitivity of 81.8%, specificity of 94.8%, and positive predictive value of 90.6%. AlbuSure's sensitivity was lower (71.4%) when compared with AER; however, this was higher than the sensitivity achieved by dipsticks against AER (50.7%). On testing urine samples stored for 3 days at 4 degrees C, AlbuSure results were 100% reproducible after 1 day and had an overall reproducibility of 92% after 3 days. When urine was retested after 3 and 15 mo of storage at -70 degrees C, AlbuSure was greater than or equal to 90% reproducible, with some of the differing results attributable to corresponding changes in albumin concentration. The overnight sample appeared to be the sample of choice for testing with AlbuSure in that it showed excellent reproducibility and the highest sensitivity (compared to both albumin concentration and AER).\r"

HR variation with breathing at 12 breaths/min and ventilatory response to hypercapnia/hypoxia were measured in fewer subjects. CRR results were compared with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, the neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sweat testing. The objective was to compare the sensitivity of various methods of characterizing diabetic patients and to use this information when staging patients for clinical therapeutic trials. CRR responses were age dependent in both populations. Either delta R6 or VR was abnormal in 74% of diabetic patients, delta R6 being more sensitive. CRRs correlated well with the presence of symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, abnormalities on the neurological examination, results of nerve conduction studies, and sweating activity in the feet of the same patients. However, both CRRs and sweating were abnormal in a high proportion of patients without any clinical manifestations of neuropathy. The ventilatory reflex response to moderate hypercapnia/hypoxia was also measured. It was normal in most of the diabetic patients tested, including many with severe reduction of CRRs. We conclude from the combined results of CRR, ventilatory response, and other studies that the causative factors for abnormal CRR may not be confined to the vagus nerves, and that in most instances, the depressed CRR may be due to a decrease in the efficacy of sensorimotor nerve conduction around the reflex arc.\r"

Neither the quality of family life nor aspects of the parents' marriage predicted the child's metabolic control over the next 3-4 mo, and they were also unrelated to concurrent weight-adjusted insulin dosage. Longitudinal data spanning a 6-yr period of the child's diabetes also failed to reveal an association between aspects of family life and metabolic control.

This figure is thought to reflect the minimum prevalence of IDDM in that population, because there is an inherent tendency in the method of screening used toward underestimating the true prevalence rate. The prevalence of IDDM was found to increase significantly with age and was slightly higher in girls than boys, but this was not statistically significant. Of 41 children with IDDM detected in the survey, 7 were not known to have IDDM before but were showing suggestive symptoms at the time of the study. This study showed that IDDM in childhood is not rare in Sudan and that probably a substantial number of undiagnosed cases exist.\r"

The mean weight loss with diet alone was 1.9 (3) kg compared with 7.5 (4.1) kg with the balloon (p less than 0.001). Apart from postinsertion vomiting, which resolved by 72 hours, there were no gastric complications associated with the balloon.

The median peak pH recorded during the evening meal was only 4.1 (range 2.4-6.2) in the antrum compared with 6.3 (range 4.4-6.7) in the body (p less than 0.01). Preprandial pH (median value over the hour prior to the evening meal) was similar in the antrum (median = 1.9, range 1.2-2.5) and body (median = 1.9, range 1.3-2.8). Night-time pH (median pH value between 23 00 h and 05 00 h) in six subjects remained low and was similar in the antrum (median = 1.4, range 1.2-1.7) and body (median = 1.3, range 1.1-1.7). In two subjects, however, there were episodes of raised night-time pH which were more marked in the antrum than in the body.

  ".W": "Forty six patients with endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulceration were randomly allocated to treatment with either sucralfate 1 g qds (n = 24) or cimetidine 200 mg tds and 400 mg nocte (n = 22). When the ulcers healed, a maintenance dose of sucralfate 1 g bd or cimetidine 400 mg nocte was given for one year (or until relapse if earlier). Biopsies of duodenal mucosa adjacent to ulcer sites for light and electron microscopy were obtained before and after healing and again after one year's maintenance if the ulcer remained healed. Duodenal biopsies were also taken from 20 age and sex matched controls. Rates of healing and relapse during maintenance did not differ between the two treatments, although relapses occurred earlier with cimetidine. In the three year post-maintenance follow up period 10/13 cimetidine patients relapsed compared with four of 11 sucralfate patients (p less than 0.05), the relapses occurring significantly earlier in the cimetidine treated patients (p less than 0.05). Mucosal biopsies from both treatment groups still showed considerable abnormalities after healing. During maintenance, however, the sucralfate scores fell significantly (p less than 0.02) to near control levels unlike the cimetidine scores which remained raised at pretreatment values. The histological and ultrastructural changes were not predictive of later relapse. These findings favour the use of sucralfate in preference to cimetidine for maintenance treatment in the prevention of relapse of healed duodenal ulcers.\r"

Ileal bile acid concentrations showed a 54.0 (9.3)% absorption of glycochenodeoxycholic acid by the 40 cm ileal segment.

(2) In 25 patients followed for 10 days after operation for Crohn's disease, there was a significant fall in fibronectin concentrations of 43% (p less than 0.01, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). This fall was maximal on the second postoperative day and was more marked in patients undergoing more major operative procedures. (3) The predictive value of plasma fibronectin for subsequent stricture formation or progression was studied for one year; during which 10 patients developed strictures requiring operative treatment. Higher plasma fibronectin concentrations were related to stricture formation, although there was not a complete, predictive relationship. In this study we found that plasma fibronectin concentrations were low in patients with extensive or severe Crohn's disease, fall after operation and may be related to the risk of stricture formation. This relationship is unlikely to be of clinical value, although it shows the potential significance of fibronectin in the pathogenesis of strictures.\r"

Results differ from previously published data by showing much higher indices of pressure activity with amplitudes up to 490 mmHg in IBS, and 450 mmHg in controls. Study segment activity index and mean pressure wave amplitudes were significantly (p less than 0.015 and p less than 0.01) higher in IBS than controls, but per cent duration of activity was similar for the whole period of study. During the basal period in controls mean amplitudes recorded from the proximal sigmoid (40 cm from anus) were significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than those in the descending colon (50 cm), distal sigmoid (30 cm) and rectum (15 cm). This study shows that the increased colonic activity in IBS is characterised by increased amplitude, but not duration of pressure waves. In the basal state there is a high pressure zone in the proximal sigmoid colon of controls. Pressures in the unprepared colon of controls and IBS were higher than those measured under other experimental conditions.\r"

Agreement between methods was good for mean amplitude: (bias -0.5 mmHg; (36.8) (2 SD, limits of agreement); -5.8 to 4.8, 95% CI of bias; 0-289, average range of values by both methods), % duration of activity: (-0.9; (13.4); -2.9 to 0.9; 0-100), motility index: (-55; (2072); -356 to 245; 0-26,220), number of peaks: (-20; (91); -44 to 3.5; 1-211), and activity index bias -5.2 mmHg. min; (127.3); -23.7, to 13.2; 0-2159. The time taken for manual analysis was 889 minutes compared with 14 minutes for the automated system. Fully automated analysis of colonic pressure records is fast, objective, and shows good agreement with labour intensive manual analysis. Previously acquired data can be reanalysed using new definitions and criteria. Widespread use of the technique could introduce uniformity in colonic pressure record analysis. In addition this wave form analysis system can be adapted to record and analyse pressure data from other regions of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of increasing the calcium, magnesium and sodium concentration in gall bladder bile samples from 21 patients with gall stones and nine controls on the in vitro rate of formation of cholesterol microcrystals and numbers of cholesterol microcrystals formed was examined. Addition of these cations to raise the mean maximum concentration of calcium ions to 19.8 mmol/l, of magnesium ions to 20 mmol/l and sodium ions to 998 mmol/l did not trigger nucleation in control bile samples or samples from patients with gall stones. Increasing the mean concentration of calcium ions to 8.6 mmol/l and of sodium to 320 mmol/l increased the numbers of cholesterol monohydrate crystals/0.1 mm3 counted by light polarisation phase contrast microscopy at the time of nucleation in samples from patients with gall stones from a median of 2 (range 1-10) in control portions to 18 (range 2-128) for calcium ions and 10 (range 2-141) for sodium ions (p less than 0.001). Calcium and magnesium ions were more effective than sodium ions, and calcium ions could increase crystal numbers at concentrations found in samples from patients with gall stones, median 4.6 mmol/l (range 2.7-16.9 mmol/l). The concentrations of calcium and magnesium present in bile may therefore influence the rate of development of gall stones.\r"

  ".W": "Acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats was induced by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Prostaglandin E2 (100 micrograms/kg subcutaneously twice) decreased the mortality rate from 100% to 60% (NS). When treatment with prostaglandin E2 was combined with simultaneous administration of either dazmegrel (UK 38,485, 50 mg/kg bodyweight) or Sibelium (Flunarizine R 14,950, 0.2 mg/kg body weight) a significant decrease in the mortality rate (p less than 0.05) was recorded. Dazmegrel is a selective thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and prevents the formation of thromboxane A2. Flunarizine (a calcium entry blocker) decreases thromboxane A2 formation and also inhibits the effects of raised thromboxane A2 concentrations. As plasma thromboxane B2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) concentrations increase and the plasma prostaglandin E2 concentrations decrease in acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats, the results of the present study indicate that these prostaglandins play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is suggested that restoration of the balance in prostanoid concentrations will have a beneficial effect on the course of acute necrotising pancreatitis.\r"

Shockwave applications to the human gall bladders resulted in disintegration of the stones with no macroscopically or microscopically detectable tissue changes. In acute animal experiments, small haematomas were observed in all six animals at surfaces, but also inside the liver and gall bladder (max diameter 25 mm). Perforation or intra-abdominal or pleural bleeding did not occur. In chronic experiments, no macroscopic, and only slight microscopic residual lesions (haemosiderin deposits) were seen three weeks after shockwave. In almost all instances, the lesions were detected by CT, MRI, and ultrasonography, while laboratory tests were negative.\r"

The final diagnosis in each case was ulcerative colitis. Two of the patients have responded to anti-inflammatory medication but one has required panproctocolectomy. The sequence of symptoms and observations in these cases, as well as in others from the literature involving more familiar pathogens, suggests that bacterial infection may contribute to the development of chronic colitis. This supposition could be tested by extending the follow up of patients with acute infective colitis in a prospective multicentre trial.\r"

There was widespread dissatisfaction with the provision of facilities and staff for endoscopy. From 1981 to 1986 the number of consultants with an interest in gastroenterology had increased from 20 to 25, but none of these appointments had been anticipated in 1981. All eight senior registrars in gastroenterology in 1981 had achieved consultant status - three in the region, four in the NHS outside the region, and one abroad.\r"

This method allows us to study the response of the airway when its inner epithelial surface or its outer serosal surface is stimulated independently. Using this system we evaluated how the presence of intact epithelium can affect pharmacological responsiveness. We first examined responses of tracheae with intact epithelium to histamine, acetylcholine, and hypertonic KCl when stimulated from the epithelial or serosal side. We then examined the effect of epithelial denudation on the responses to these agonists. With an intact epithelium, stimulation of the inner epithelial side always caused significantly smaller changes in diameter than stimulation of the outer serosal side. After mechanical denudation of the epithelium, these differences were almost completely abolished. In the absence of intact epithelium, the trachea was 35-fold more sensitive to histamine and 115-fold more sensitive to acetylcholine when these agents were applied to the inner epithelial side. In addition, the presence of an intact epithelium almost completely inhibited any response to epithelial side challenge with hypertonic KCl. These results indicate that the airway epithelial layer has a potent protective role in airway responses to luminal side stimuli, leading us to speculate that changes in airway reactivity measured in various conditions including asthma may result in part from changes in epithelial function.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the accelerated rate of lobe weight gain during severe pulmonary edema is attributed to increased permeability of the microvascular barrier or a loss of tissue forces opposing filtration, the effect of edema on capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,C), interstitial compliance (Ci), and the volume of fluid filtered after a step increase in microvascular pressure (delta Vi) were determined in eight isolated left lower lobes of dog lungs perfused at 37 degrees C with autologous blood. After attaining a base-line isogravimetric state, the capillary pressure (Pc) was increased in successive steps of 2, 5, and 10 cmH2O. This sequence of vascular pressure increases was repeated three times. Edema accumulation was expressed as weight gained as a percent of initial lobe weight (% delta Wt), and Kf,C was measured by time 0 extrapolation of the weight gain curve. An exponential rate constant for the decrease in the rate of weight gain with time (K) was calculated for each curve. Ci was then calculated by assuming that the capillary wall and interstitium constitute a resistance-capacitance network. Kf,C was not increased by edema formation in any group. Between mild (% delta Wt less than 30%) and severe edema states (% delta Wt greater than 50%) respective mean Ci increased significantly from 3.54 to 9.12 ml.cmH2O-1.100 g-1, K decreased from 0.089 to 0.036 min-1, and delta Vi increased from 1.28 to 2.4 ml.cmH2O-1.100 g-1. The delta Vi during each Pc increase was highly correlated with Kf,C and Ci when used together as independent variables (r = 0.99) but less well correlated when used separately.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, differences in sampling techniques and experimental methods make comparisons difficult. Our studies were carried out to compare the erythropoietic response with the same altitude in age-matched natives of the Himalayas and Andes by the same experimental techniques. Healthy male subjects were selected in Ollague, Chile (n = 29, 27.3 +/- 5.9 yr) and in Khunde, Nepal (n = 30, 24.7 +/- 3.8 yr). Both of these villages are located at 3,700 m above sea level. Hematologic measurements confirmed lower hematocrit values in Nepal (48.4 +/- 4.5%) than in Chile (52.2 +/- 4.6%) (P less than 0.003). When subjects were matched for hematocrit, erythropoietin concentrations in Chile were higher than in Nepal (P less than 0.01). Detailed measurements of blood O2 affinity in Nepal showed no differences in shape or position of the O2 equilibrium curve between Sherpas and Western sojourners. Our results indicate that although Quechua Indians have higher hematocrits than Sherpas living at the same altitude, nevertheless they may be functionally anemic.\r"

The capsule was connected to a pressure transducer and a pipette calibrated in microliters. We filled the system with fluid and measured flow into the diaphragmatic surface facing the capsule (Fcap, microliter/cm2), from liquid displacement in the pipette at different hydraulic pressures in the system (Pcap). Pleural liquid pressure was simultaneously measured in the supraphrenic region (Psup). Fcap was positively correlated to transdiaphragmatic pressure gradient (Psup-Pcap) and breathing frequency but was unaffected by protein concentration of capsular fluid. For a breathing frequency of 30 cycles/min and a Psup - Pcap = -2 cmH2O, Fcap was 0.54 microliter.min-1.cm-2 for capsules applied at end expiration and 10-fold greater for capsules applied at end inspiration. Data indicate that the diaphragmatic tendinous portion in rabbits is a draining site for peritoneal fluid and that the conductance of the draining pathways (lymphatic stomata) is related to diaphragmatic tension. In the intact rabbit the average peritoneal fluid drainage through the tendinous portion of the diaphragm (approximately 16 cm2) was estimated at 43 microliters/min.\r"

  ".W": "Cutaneous vascular responses to dynamic exercise have been well characterized, but it is not known whether that response pattern applies to isometric handgrip exercise. We examined cutaneous vascular responses to isometric handgrip and dynamic leg exercise in five supine men. Skin blood flow was measured by laser-Doppler velocimetry and expressed as laser-Doppler flow (LDF). Arterial blood pressure was measured noninvasively once each minute. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as LDF/mean arterial pressure. LDF and CVC responses were measured at the forearm and chest during two 3-min periods of isometric handgrip at 30% of maximum voluntary contraction and expressed as percent changes from the preexercise levels. The skin was normothermic (32 degrees C) for the first period of handgrip and was locally warmed to 39 degrees C for the second handgrip. Finally, responses were observed during 5 min of dynamic two-leg bicycle exercise (150-175 W) at a local skin temperature of 39 degrees C. Arm LDF increased 24.5 +/- 18.9% during isometric handgrip in normothermia and 64.8 +/- 14.1% during isometric handgrip at 39 degrees C (P less than 0.05). Arm CVC did not significantly change at 32 degrees C but significantly increased 18.1 +/- 6.5% during isometric handgrip at 39 degrees C (P less than 0.05). Arm LDF decreased 12.2 +/- 7.9% during dynamic exercise at 39 degrees C, whereas arm CVC fell by 35.3 +/- 4.6% (in each case P less than 0.05). Chest LDF and CVC showed similar responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sound (SMG) generated by the biceps muscle during isometric exercise at 20, 40, 60, and 80% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) up to exhaustion has been recorded by a contact transducer and integrated (iSMG), together with the surface electromyogram (EMG) in eight young untrained men. At the onset of exercise, iSMG and integrated surface EMG (iEMG) amplitude increased linearly with exercise. iSMG remained constant for 253 +/- 73 (SD), 45 +/- 16, 21 +/- 5, and 0 s at the four levels of contraction. Then iSMG increased linearly at 20% MVC, fluctuated at 40% MVC, and decreased exponentially at 60 and 80% MVC. iSMG exhaustion-to-onset ratio was 5.0 at 20%, 1.0 at 40%, and 0.2 at 60 and 80% MVC. On the contrary, independently of exercise intensity, iEMG increased with time, being 1.4 higher at exhaustion than at the onset. The nonunivocal iSMG changes with time and effort of exercise suggest that the sound may be a useful tool to acquire different information to EMG and output force during muscle contraction up to fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "Negative upper airway (UAW) pressure inhibits diaphragm inspiratory activity in animals, but there is no direct evidence of this reflex in humans. Also, little is known regarding reflex latency or effects of varying time of stimulation during the breathing cycle. We studied effects of UAW negative pressure on inspiratory airflow and respiratory timing in seven tracheostomized infants during quiet sleep with a face mask and syringe used to produce UAW suction without changing lower airway pressure. Suction trials lasted 2-3 s. During UAW suction, mean and peak inspiratory airflow as well as tidal volume was markedly reduced (16-68%) regardless of whether stimulation occurred in inspiration or expiration. Reflex latency was 42 +/- 3 ms. When suction was applied during inspiration or late expiration, the inspiration and the following expiration were shortened. In contrast, suction applied during midexpiration prolonged expiration and tended to prolong inspiration. The changes in flow, tidal volume, and timing indicate a marked inhibitory effect of UAW suction on thoracic inspiratory muscles. Such a reflex mechanism may function in preventing pharyngeal collapse by inspiratory suction pressure.\r"

The medulla was explored for expiratory neuronal action potentials during positive pressure breathing (PPB) (approximately 3 cmH2O) because many expiratory cells had little or no discharge during spontaneous breathing off load. After finding an expiratory unit, the response of the cell to removal (30-60 s) and reinstatement of PPB was measured. Projections to the spinal cord were also examined, and position of the cell was assessed. Results were compared with those obtained from rostral and caudal medullary expiratory neurons in adult opossums. Mean discharge rate of expiratory cells during PPB increased as a function of age. Discharge started with a delay after the cessation of inspiration; this delay decreased as a function of age. Cells averaged 7.5 spikes/breath during PPB and 2.2 spikes/breath off load. Forty-four percent of cells discharged less than once per breath when PPB was removed. Of cells becoming completely silent off load, 73% lost their discharge within the first two unloaded breaths. Only 5% of caudal and 15% of rostral medullary expiratory cells in adult opossums became silent after the end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure was reduced to normal. Neurons in sucklings were most often bulbospinal as were caudal medullary cells in adults; neurons were found in the region of the nucleus ambiguus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All circumstances except RE evoked tonic activities in Ephr, Edi, and Eic but never in Etr. Intravenous atropine abolished carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction and associated tonic inspiratory activities, but this effect persisted with RI, histamine, and PDG. Selective procaine block of conduction in thin vagal fibers (with persistence of the Breuer-Hering inflation reflex) reduced or suppressed the tonic response, which was abolished in all cases after vagotomy. 2) In rabbits artificially ventilated with open chest, passive deflation of the lung or intravenous injections of histamine or PDG also produced tonic discharge in Ephr and often in Eic. The present results demonstrate that 1) stimulation of vagal afferents and mostly thin sensory fibers elicits tonic inspiratory discharges, 2) bronchoconstriction is not necessary for the induction of the response, and 3) reflexes from the chest wall do not mediate this response in rabbits.\r"

Data were compared with values from untrained weight-matched control rats. Maximum running time to exhaustion increased significantly (P less than 0.01) by 4 wk and again at 12 wk (P less than 0.01). Submaximal running endurance increased by 120 (4 wk), 320 (8 wk), and 372% (12 wk) (P less than 0.01). VO2 max was increased only at 12 wk (86.0 +/- 2.7 vs. 75.5 +/- 1.9 ml O2.kg-1.min-1); VO2 submax was decreased at 4 and 8 wk but not at 12 wk. Soleus QO2 was unchanged after 4 wk of training and increased by 50% at 8 wk and by 77% at 12 wk. This study is the first to show a dissociation in both the time course and the magnitude of longitudinal changes in VO2 max, VO2 submax, QO2, and maximal and submaximal running performance. We conclude that factors other than those measured explain the improvement in running performance that resulted from endurance training in these rats.\r"

Arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) increased initially, but isocapnia was established during the latter half of the infusion (delta PaCO2 = 0.4 +/- 2.0 Torr). Bilateral cervical vagotomy eliminated the f response to acid infusions (n = 9, delta f = 0.6 +/- 2.4 breaths/min). The increase in VT (12.6 +/- 3.1 ml) was greater, but that in V (0.39 +/- 0.11 l/min) was less than in intact animals (P less than 0.05). PaCO2 remained elevated throughout the infusion (delta PaCO2 = 5.5 +/- 2.6 Torr), resulting in a greater rise in arterial [H+] (delta[H+]a = 53.6 +/- 6.6 nmol/l, delta pHa = -0.37 +/- 0.04). It is concluded that vagal afferents play a role in the f response to acute metabolic acidosis in rabbits.\r"

The male corpulent rats develop atherosclerotic lesions of the major arteries and myocardial lesions. Corpulent and lean male rats were induced through mild food restriction to run intensively (approximately 6,000 m/day) from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. Food restriction, especially when coupled with running, lowered all classes of lipids in the whole serum of corpulent rats. The principal changes in lipid concentrations were in the very low-density lipoprotein fraction. Food restriction caused a significant drop in fasting insulin levels of corpulent rats and decreased beta-cell hyperplasia. Both effects were more marked in the running animals. There was a significant decrease in myocardial lesion frequency in the food-restricted corpulent rats and an absence of lesions in the running rats. The results indicate that intensive physical activity can largely correct the lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance of this atherosclerosis-prone strain, and these changes are associated with inhibition of the disease process. However, moderate food restriction has similar effects, and the greater effects seen with intensive running may simply reflect an effectively more severe metabolic restriction in the presence of the exercise.\r"

Nine ovarihysterectomized women [50 +/- 2 (SE) yr of age] were studied after 1 wk of treatment with placebo (lactose) or combined progestin and estrogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate, 20 mg tid, and Premarin, 1.25 mg bid). Subjects showed few respiratory disturbances during placebo treatment. Despite this, combined progestin and estrogen administration reduced the number of sleep-disordered breathing episodes in every subject, decreasing the average number of episodes per subject from 15 +/- 4 to 3 +/- 1. The duration of hypopneas also decreased with hormone treatment. Thus the presence of progestin and estrogen may be involved in protecting premenopausal women against sleep-disordered breathing.\r"

Mean pulmonary arterial pressures were lower in the chronically hypoxic rats fed fish oil (19.7 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) than in the rats fed corn oil (25.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg) or regular diets (27.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, P less than 0.05).

Lung thromboxane B2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha levels were lower, and platelet aggregation, in response to collagen, was reduced in rats fed fish oil. Chronically hypoxic rats fed fish oil had lower mortality rates than the other hypoxic rats. They also had lower blood viscosity, as well as less right ventricular hypertrophy and less peripheral extension of vascular smooth muscle to intra-acinar pulmonary arteries (P less than 0.05 for each). The mechanism by which dietary fish oil decreases pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling during chronic hypoxia remains uncertain. The finding that a fish oil diet can reduce the hemodynamic and morphological sequelae of chronic hypoxia may have therapeutic significance.\r"

In this study we investigated whether rabbits with increased levels of endogenous pulmonary surfactant are more resistant to hyperoxia. Rabbits were exposed to 100% O2 for 64 h and then returned to room air for 8 days (preexposed). At this time, they had normal gas exchange and alveolar permeability to solute and increased levels of lavageable alveolar phospholipids compared with control rabbits breathing air (26 +/- 2 vs. 12 +/- 2 mumol/kg). Preexposed rabbits survived significantly longer than control rabbits when reexposed to 100% O2 (166 +/- 24 vs. 80 +/- 6 h; n = 7; P less than 0.05) and had significantly higher values of total lavageable phospholipids after 72 h in 100% O2 (15 +/- 2 vs. 5 +/- 2 mumol/kg). Controls developed arterial hypoxemia after 72 h in 100% O2. On the other hand, preexposed rabbits maintained arterial PO2 values greater than 100 Torr throughout the hyperoxic exposure and developed progressive respiratory acidosis. Specific activities of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in lung homogenates and isolated alveolar type II pneumocytes of preexposed rabbits were unchanged from those of controls before O2 reexposure and after 72 h in 100% O2. We concluded that 1) increases in pulmonary antioxidant enzyme specific activities are not necessary for the development of O2 tolerance in rabbits and 2) pulmonary surfactant may play a role in O2 adaptation.\r"

GR32191 antagonized competitively the contractile responses of all three prostanoids to a similar degree but had no effect on MCh-induced contractions. In asthmatic subjects GR32191, in a single oral dose of 80 mg, did not affect base-line airway caliber or MCh-induced broncho-constriction but caused significant inhibition of PGD2-induced bronchoconstriction, displacing the concentration-response curves to the right by greater than 10-fold. The effect of the same oral dose of GR32191 on allergen-induced immediate bronchoconstriction was subsequently investigated in allergic asthmatic subjects. In individual subjects, GR32191 inhibited to varying degrees the overall bronchoconstrictor response, with the maximum effect occurring between 10 and 30 min after allergen challenge. These studies suggest that prostanoids contribute to the immediate bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in allergic asthmatics, and that this effect is mediated by stimulation of a thromboxane receptor.\r"

The transmural pressure required for maximal active changes in volume (isobaric contraction) with electrical field stimulation was increased in papain-treated animals. We conclude that tracheal cartilage provides a preload which stretches the trachealis muscle toward optimal length and that papain, by altering the elastic mechanical properties of cartilage, decreases this preload.\r"

By using intramuscular electrodes, we measured the electromyographic activity of different parts of the diaphragm (Edi) during quiet breathing in several postures in 13 anesthetized mongrel dogs. The Edi of the left and right costal hemi-diaphragm was compared between the left and right lateral decubitus postures, whereas that from the substernal and crural regions was compared between the supine and prone positions. On changing posture, the Edi of the dependent part of the diaphragm decreased in both cases, whereas that of the non-dependent part increased. The results were consistent with reflex modulation of regional diaphragm activation in response to postural changes in local resting length. However, these changes in Edi persisted after bilateral vagotomy, cordotomy (C7-T1) and dorsal rhizotomy of the C5-C7 roots. Compound muscle action potentials, recorded in different regions of the diaphragm and evoked by supramaximal stimulation of the phrenic nerves, were altered with changes in posture in the same direction as Edi. Because the stimuli were supramaximal, these changes reflected systematic changes in the recording conditions with posture, possibly because of a combination of 1) changes in the electrical environment surrounding the intramuscular electrodes and 2) passive changes in muscle length. Our results demonstrate systematic, reproducible, posture-dependent changes in regional Edi that may not be due to different neural drive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These cells that retain the contractile properties of intact bundles were voltage-clamped by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Upon voltage steps from a holding potential of -60 mV to more positive levels, the initial inward current was followed by large outward currents that inactivated slowly. These were subsequently reduced by substituting Cs+ for K+ in the internal solution and by using Ba2+ instead of Ca2+ as a charge carrier in the external solution. Under these conditions, the inward current did not completely inactivate in the course of 300-ms voltage steps. Inward current measured after leak subtraction was activated at a membrane potential of -25.8 +/- 5 mV, was maximum at +18 +/- 4 mV, and had an apparent reversal potential of +52.5 +/- 5.5 mV (n = 5). The potential at which steady-state inactivation was half-maximum was -28 mV (n = 5). This inward current was identified as a calcium current on the following basis: 1) it was not altered by 10 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by lowering to 10 mM external Na+ concentration; 2) it was blocked by 2.5 mM Co2+ or 1 microM PN 200-110; 3) it was enhanced by 1 microM BAY K 8644, which in addition suppressed the PN 200-110 blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether a swimming exercise program would alter sarcolemmal enzyme activity, ion flux, and composition in rat hearts. After approximately 11 wk of exercise training, cardiac myosin and actomyosin Ca2+-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity was significantly higher in exercised rat hearts than in sedentary control rat hearts. Glycogen content was increased in plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles from exercised animals as was succinic dehydrogenase activity in gastrocnemius muscle of exercised rats in comparison to sedentary rat preparations. Sarcolemmal vesicles were isolated from hearts of exercise-trained and control rats. Sarcolemmal Na+-K+-ATPase and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities, Na+-Ca2+ exchange, and passive Ca2+ binding did not differ between the two groups. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and 5'-nucleotidase activity were elevated in the cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles isolated from exercised animals compared with sedentary control rats. Sarcolemmal phospholipid composition was not altered by the exercise training. Our results demonstrate that swimming training in rats does not affect most parameters of cardiac sarcolemmal function or composition. However, the elevated sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump activity in exercised rats may help to reduce intracellular Ca2+ and augment cardiac relaxation rates. The enhanced 5'-nucleotidase activity may stimulate adenosine production, which could affect myocardial blood flow. The present results further our knowledge on the subcellular response of the heart to swimming training in the rat.\r"

Dose-response curves to prostaglandin F2 alpha, (PGF2 alpha), angiotensin II (ANG II), and norepinephrine (NE) and responses to a depolarizing concentration of KCl were obtained on rings of pulmonary artery from normal rats, chronically hypoxic (10% O2 for 10 days) rats, and chronically hypoxic rats treated with cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline (cHyp), an agent that blocks collagen accumulation. Treatment with this agent prevented the rise in pulmonary blood pressure normally seen during hypoxia. Collagen content was twice normal in hypoxic vessels and was significantly reduced in vessels from cHyp-treated hypoxic rats. There was no change in reactivity to PGF2 alpha, but reactivity to ANG II, NE, and KCl was decreased in vessels from hypoxic rats. cHyp treatment completely restored reactivity to NE and KCl and partially restored reactivity to ANG II. The changes in contractility could be a response to the lower blood pressure. Another explanation is that collagen deposited in hypertensive pulmonary arteries may impair reactivity to some constrictor agonists.\r"

In nine healthy subjects (20-34 yr), we measured MSNA (peroneal nerve), venous plasma levels of NE and E, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and end-tidal O2 and CO2 before (control) and during breathing of 1) 12% O2 for 20 min, 2) 10% O2 for 20 min, and 3) 8% O2 for 10 min--in random order. MSNA increased above control in five, six, and all nine subjects during 12, 10, and 8% O2, respectively (P less than 0.01), but only after delays of 12 (12% O2) and 4 min (8 and 10% O2). MSNA (total activity) rose 83 +/- 20, 260 +/- 146, and 298 +/- 109% (SE) above control by the final minute of breathing 12, 10, and 8% O2, respectively. NE did not rise above control at any level of hypoxemia; E rose slightly (P less than 0.05) at one time only with both 10 and 8% O2. Individual changes in MSNA during hypoxemia were unrelated to elevations in heart rate or decrements in blood pressure and end-tidal CO2--neither of which always fell. We conclude that in contrast to some other sympathoexcitatory stimuli such as exercise or cold stress, moderate to severe hypoxemia increases leg MSNA without raising plasma NE in resting humans.\r"

  ".W": "Lithium clearance (CLi) has been advanced as a measure of sodium delivery from the proximal tubules. Because information on the intrarenal effects of water immersion is only limited, and available data are conflicting with respect to the effects on the proximal tubule, we examined the effects of 3 h of water immersion on renal functional parameters, including CLi, in eight healthy subjects. Studies were carried out during maximal water diuresis. Water immersion resulted in a significant increase in sodium excretion, from preimmersion values of 74.0 +/- 9.6 to 155.4 +/- 12.0 mumol/min at the third immersion hour (P less than 0.01). This natriuresis was accompanied by an increase in CLi from 26.3 +/- 1.9 (preimmersion) to 37.0 +/- 3.1 ml/min (P less than 0.01). Fractional lithium reabsorption (FRLi) decreased from 76.4 +/- 1.0 to 69.6 +/- 1.3% (P less than 0.01). None of these changes was found in eight healthy subjects undergoing a time-control study without water immersion. The large fall in FRLi found during immersion is compatible with a major resetting of the proximal glomerulotubular balance. In this regard the renal response to water immersion resembles saline expansion rather than mere intravascular expansion. The lithium data suggested a large rise in distal delivery accompanied by an almost as large rise in distal reabsorption. The free water clearance data were in agreement with this interpretation. However, no changes were found in fractional excretion of phosphate and uric acid. Therefore such a major resetting of proximal glomerulotubular balance can be doubted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When these animals were exercised (9.14 m/min, level treadmill) in a warm (30 degrees C, 30-40% relative humidity) environment, their mean endurance was increased from 67.9 (saline-treated controls, CONT) to 93.6 min (P less than 0.01).

Atropine administration (ATR, 200 micrograms/kg, tail vein)  significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the endurance and the salivary water loss of CONT and PEG-treated rats, whereas it increased the heating rate (P less than 0.01) of both groups. PEG treatment reduced (P less than 0.01) the hematocrit and circulating protein levels both before and subsequent to exercise in the warm environment. Clinical chemical indexes of heat/exercise injury were generally unaffected by pharmacological intervention, whereas clinical chemical responses to exercise were related to the endurance time of each group. We concluded that expansion of PV by PEG provided significant beneficial effects on performance and thermoregulation during exercise in a warm environment.\r"

Creatine phosphate (CP) content was analyzed in pools of freeze-dried fast-twitch (FT) and slow-twitch (ST) muscle fiber fragments, and ATP, CP, creatine, and lactate content were assayed in mixed pools of FT and ST fibers. CP content at rest was 82.7 +/- 11.2 and 73.1 +/- 9.5 (SD) mmol/kg dry wt in FT and ST fibers (P less than 0.05). After exercise the corresponding values were 25.4 +/- 19.8 and 29.7 +/- 14.4 mmol/kg dry wt.

ATP content decreased (P less than 0.05) and lactate content rose to 67.4 +/- 28.3 mmol/kg dry wt (P less than 0.001) in response to exercise. It is concluded that basal CP content is higher in FT fibers than in ST fibers. CP content also appears to be higher in ST fibers after a 60-s recovery period after maximal short-term exercise. These data are consistent with the different metabolic profiles of FT and ST fibers.\r"

At the length of maximum force generation, passive active and total tensions of the adult muscle were 2.5 times greater than preterm values (P less than 0.001). KCl stimulation yielded a greater peak tension in the adult strips than in the preterm strips (P less than 0.01). Preterm strips required higher concentrations of KCl to initiate contractions and higher concentrations to reach peak tension. Acetylcholine- (ACh) induced contraction resulted in greater force development at each dose in the adult strips compared with preterm strips (P less than 0.001). The dose of ACh required to reach a half-maximal response was significantly less for the adult strips than for the preterm strips (P less than 0.005). These data demonstrate that both force generation and receptor sensitivity increase with age. This inability of immature smooth muscle to generate as much force as adult smooth muscle may help explain why very preterm neonates requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation are at risk for developing structural airway problems.\r"

To investigate UA responses to breathing route in normal awake humans, we studied eight healthy males (ages 21-38 yr) during successive trials of voluntary nose breathing (N), voluntary mouth breathing (M), and mouth breathing with nose occluded (MO). We measured genioglossus electromyographic activity (EMGgg) with perorally inserted bipolar electrodes, alae nasi (EMGan) and diaphragm EMG activity (EMGdi) with surface electrodes, and minute ventilation (VE) with a pneumotachograph. Mean phasic inspiratory EMG activity of both UA muscles was significantly greater during N than during M or MO, even when a 2.5-cmH2O.l-1.s inspiratory resistance was added to MO (P less than 0.01). In contrast, neither EMGdi nor VE was consistently affected by breathing route. EMGgg during N was significantly decreased after selective topical nasal anesthesia (P less than 0.002); a decrease in EMGan did not achieve statistical significance. These data suggest that peak UA dilating muscle activity may be modulated by superficial receptors in the nasal mucosa sensitive to airflow.\r"

Despite the important impairment in somatic growth during hypoxia, at 50 days body weight and nose-tail length were as in control rats never exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxic rats had a bigger chest, with larger anteroposterior diameter, larger surface area of the muscle component of the diaphragm, and heavier and more expanded lungs. None of these structural changes were observed in a third group of rats, which were exposed for 6 days to hypoxia between 35 and 42 days of age, i.e., at a much more advanced stage of postnatal development. In addition, hypoxic rats had higher compliance of the respiratory system and of the lung and lower total pulmonary resistance than control rats. Frequency dependence of compliance was not different. We conclude that in the rat the structural changes induced by neonatal chronic hypoxia are not resolved by the return to normoxia but persist at least until postpuberty with modifications of the mechanical properties of the respiratory system.\r"

To examine the influence of sleep on upper airway collapsibility, inspiratory UAR (epiglottis to nares) and genioglossus electromyogram (EMG) were measured in six healthy men before and during inspiratory resistive loading. UAR increased significantly (P less than 0.05) from wakefulness to non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep [3.1 +/- 0.4 to 11.7 +/- 3.5 (SE) cmH2O.1-1.s]. Resistive load application during wakefulness produced small increments in UAR. However, during NREM sleep, UAR increased dramatically with loading in four subjects although two subjects demonstrated little change. This increment in UAR from wakefulness to sleep correlated closely with the rise in UAR during loading while asleep (e.g., load 12: r = 0.90, P less than 0.05), indicating consistent upper airway behavior during sleep. On the other hand, no measurement of upper airway behavior during wakefulness was predictive of events during sleep. Although the influence of sleep on the EMG was difficult to assess, peak inspiratory genioglossus EMG clearly increased (P less than 0.05) after load application during NREM sleep. Finally, minute ventilation fell significantly from wakefulness values during NREM sleep, with the largest decrement in sleeping minute ventilation occurring in those subjects having the greatest awake-to-sleep increment in UAR (r = -0.88, P less than 0.05). We conclude that there is marked variability among normal men in upper airway collapsibility during sleep.\r"

Physiological responses of eight euglycemic males were measured while they rested in cold (18 degrees C, stirred) water on two separate occasions. The trials followed a 3-day program of diet and exercise manipulation designed to produce either high (HMG) or low (LMG) preimmersion glycogen levels in the muscles of the legs, arms, and upper torso. Preimmersion vastus lateralis muscle glycogen concentrations were lower during the LMG trial (144 +/- 14 mmol glucose/kg dry tissue) than the HMG trial (543 +/- 53 mmol glucose/kg dry tissue). There were no significant differences between the two trials in shivering as reflected by aerobic metabolic rate or in the amount of body cooling as reflected by changes in rectal temperature during the immersions. Postimmersion muscle glycogen levels remained unchanged from preimmersion levels in both trials. Small but significant increases in plasma glucose and lactate concentration occurred during both immersions. Plasma glycerol increased during immersion in the LMG trial but not in the HMG trial. Plasma free fatty acid concentration increased during both immersion trials, but the change was apparent sooner in the LMG immersion. It was concluded that thermoregulatory responses of moderately lean and fatter individuals exposed to cold stress were not impaired by a substantial reduction in the muscle glycogen levels of several major skeletal muscle groups. Furthermore, the data suggest that, depending on the intensity of shivering, other metabolic substrates are available to enable muscle glycogen to be spared.\r"

Lungs were expanded by negative pleural pressure (Ppl) of -10, -15, -20, and -25 cmH2O. Pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and venous (Ppv) pressures were varied relative to alveolar pressure (PA = 0) and measured 5-10 mm inside the pleura (i) and outside (o) of the lungs. With Ppa(o) at -2.5 cmH2O, we constructed pressure-flow (P-Q) curves at each Ppl by lowering Ppv(o) until Q reached a maximum, indicating fully developed zone 1 choke flow. Maximum flows were negligible until Ppl fell below -10 cmH2O, then increased rapidly at Ppl of -15 and -20 cmH2O, and at Ppl of -25 cmH2O reached about 15 ml.min-1.kg body wt-1. The Ppv(o) at which flow became nearly constant depended on degree of lung inflation and was 5-8 cmH2O more positive than Ppl. As Ppv(o) was lowered below Ppa(o), Ppv(i) remained equal to Ppv(o) until Ppv(i) became fixed at a pressure 2-3 cmH2O more positive than Ppl. At this point the choke flow was therefore located in veins near the pleural boundary. No evidence of choke flow (only ohmic resistance) was seen in the intrapulmonary segment of the vessels remaining open in zone 1. With Ppv(o) held roughly at Ppl, Q could be stopped by lowering Ppa(o), at which time Ppa(i) was several cmH2O above Ppv(i), showing that intrapulmonary vessel closure had occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also measured dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and lung resistance (RL) and calculated the time course of respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) during the breath in the assisted and unassisted states at a sustained exercise level corresponding to 70-80% of the subject's maximum O2 consumption. Unlike helium breathing, resistive PA had no effect on VE or any of its subdivisions partly as the result of an offsetting increase in RL (0.78 cmH2O.1-1.s) and partly to a reduction in Pmus. These results indicate that the normal resistive load does not constrain ventilation during heavy exercise. Furthermore, the increase in exercise ventilation observed with helium breathing, which is associated with much smaller degrees of resistive unloading (ca. -0.6 cmH2O.l-1.s), is likely the result of factors other than respiratory muscle unloading. The pattern of Pmus during exercise with and without unloading indicates that the use of P0.1 as an index of respiratory motor output under these conditions may result in misleading conclusions.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant replacement has previously been shown to be effective in the human neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. The value of surfactant replacement in models of acute lung injury other than quantitative surfactant deficiency states is, however, uncertain. In this study an acute lung injury model using rats with chronic indwelling arterial catheters, injured with N-nitroso-N-methylurethane (NNNMU), has been developed. The NNNMU injury was found to produce hypoxia, increased mortality, an alveolitis, and alterations in the pulmonary surfactant system. Alterations of surfactant obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage included a reduction in the phospholipid-to-protein ratio, reduced surface activity, and alterations in the relative percentages of the individual phospholipids compared with controls. Treatment of the NNNMU-injured rats with instilled exogenous surfactant (Survanta) improved oxygenation; reduced mortality to control values; and returned the surfactant phospholipid-to-protein ratio, surface activity, and, with the exception of phosphatidylglycerol, the relative percentages of individual surfactant phospholipids to control values.\r"

The effects of pharmacologically induced hypotension with nitroprusside (NTP) and hypotension elicited by intravenous compound 48/80 (48/80), a mast cell degranulating agent, were compared after equivalent reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Reduction of the MAP to 60% of base line with NTP in six swine caused an increase in plasma epinephrine (E) from 60 +/- 28 to 705 +/- 276 pg/ml (P = 0.032) and plasma norepinephrine (NE) from 270 +/- 46 to 796 +/- 131 pg/ml (P = 0.032). Comparable reduction in MAP elicited with 48/80 in six other swine caused a substantially greater increase in both plasma E (9,581 +/- 4,147 pg/ml; P = 0.012 vs. NTP group) and plasma NE (2,239 +/- 637 pg/ml; P = 0.041 vs. NTP group).

  ".W": "To elucidate the potential physiological significance of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in acute bronchoconstriction, we studied the effect of Ascaris suum antigen on the tachyphylactic response to PAF in 15 natively allergic mongrel dogs in vivo. Active bronchial tension was measured isometrically, and mediator secretion was measured as the arteriovenous difference (AVd) in plasma concentration across the lungs. Administration of PAF into the bronchial artery caused dose-related contraction in five control dogs (maximal active tension = 11.8 +/- 1.68 g/cm) that paralleled the increase in the AVd for serotonin (4,188 +/- 175 pg/ml) but not histamine (maximal AVd less than 6.0 ng/ml). The response to PAF was highly tachyphylactic. In contrast to PAF, 1:10 concentration of intra-arterial antigen caused substantial release of histamine (AVd = 308 +/- 57.1 ng/ml; P less than 0.001 vs. PAF). Diminished responsiveness (2-log shift in threshold and maximal contraction; P less than 0.001) to PAF was demonstrated in five dogs after 1:10 antigen, compatible with endogenous release of PAF during prior immune challenge in the same animals. Administration of Ascaris antigen caused a leftward shift in the dose-response curve to serotonin and only mild tachyphylaxis to the maximal response to histamine. Our data are compatible with physiological participation of PAF in eliciting bronchial smooth muscle contraction during the acute phase of immune activation caused by A. suum antigen.\r"

A dual in situ tracheal preparation was utilized that allowed sharp excision of epithelium. The response to intra-arterial acetylcholine (ACh) was augmented substantially in five dogs receiving 200 micrograms MBP by intraepithelial instillation. Active tension elicited by 10(-8) mol intra-arterial ACh was 34.0 +/- 2.2 g/cm before and 46.1 +/- 2.6 g/cm 30 min after MBP (P less than 0.002). There was no change in active tension in the control segment in the same dogs after intraepithelial instillation of vehicle only (34.7 +/- 3.2 vs. 34.4 +/- 2.3 g/cm; P = NS). Instillation of MBP directly into the subepithelial tracheal smooth muscle did not alter contraction. To assess whether this augmentation was caused by inhibition of an epithelial-derived relaxant factor, additional studies were performed in nine other dogs in which the epithelium was excised discretely from one of the two tracheal segments. No significant differences in contractile response to ACh or relaxation response to isoproterenol were observed at 2, 15, 30, or 60 min after epithelial excision. We demonstrate that intraepithelial administration of MBP augments the contraction of underlying canine tracheal smooth muscle elicited by ACh. This augmentation is a direct effect of MBP and does not require antagonism of epithelial inhibition.\r"

Acute anemia was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by isovolumic plasma exchange transfusion. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were reduced 33% by exchange transfusion to 8.6 +/- 0.4 g/dl and 26.5 +/- 1%, respectively. Glucose kinetics were determined by primed continuous infusion of [6-3H]glucose.

Resting blood glucose and lactate concentrations were not different in anemic animals (pooled means 5.1 +/- 0.2 and 0.9 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively). Exercise resulted in significantly decreased blood glucose (4.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.1 mM) and elevated lactate (6.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.5 mM) concentrations in anemic animals. Glucose turnover rates (Rt) were not different between anemic and control animals at rest and averaged 58.8 +/- 3.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1.

Metabolic clearance rates (MCR = Rt/[glucose]) were not different at rest (11.6 +/- 7.4) but were significantly greater in anemic (55.2 +/- 5.7 ml.kg-1.min-1) than in control animals (24.3 +/- 1.4 ml.kg-1.min-1) during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physiol. 63: 1253-1261, 1987; 65: 1217-1225, 1988) previously reported from our laboratory. 111In-labeled PMNs (111In-PMNs) and 99mTc-labeled erythrocytes were simultaneously injected into the right atrium, and the 111In-PMN percent extraction on the first passage through the lung was determined by the indicator-dilution technique. After 10 min of circulation the distribution of 111In-PMNs in selected organs was determined. The extraction of 111In-PMNs in swine was 88 +/- 3%, which was significantly greater than that of rabbits (78 +/- 3%) or dogs (72 +/- 2%). The recovery of the 111In-PMNs in the lungs of swine was 60 +/- 7%, which was two to three times higher than the recovery in lungs of rabbits or dogs. These results show that radiolabeled PMNs injected intravenously are less able to pass through the pulmonary vasculature and are retained much more within the lung in swine than in rabbits or dogs. This difference could be the result of the presence of pulmonary intravascular macrophages in the lungs of swine.\r"

Training resulted in a marked increase in maximal O2 uptake (31.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 41.0 +/- 1.8 ml.kg-1.min-1, 2.56 +/- 0.16 vs. 3.20 +/- 0.18 l/min, P less than 0.05) and small (P less than 0.05) reductions in body weight (81.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 78.7 +/- 4.0 kg) and body fat (23.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 20.9 +/- 1.3%). HR at rest was slightly, but consistently, lower after training (63 +/- 2 vs. 58 +/- 1 beats/min, P less than 0.05). In general, HR variability (index of cardiac vagal tone) was greater after training. Chronotropic responsiveness to either brief carotid baroreflex stimulation (neck suction) or inhibition (neck pressure), or to non-specific arterial baroreflex inhibition induced by a hypotensive level of lower body suction, was unchanged after training. In contrast, the magnitude of the reflex increase in forearm VR in response to three levels of lower body suction was markedly attenuated after training (38-59%; P less than 0.05 at -10 and -30 mmHg; P = 0.07 at -20 mmHg). None of these variables or responses was altered over time in the controls. These findings indicate that in healthy, previously sedentary, middle-aged and older men, strenuous and prolonged endurance training 1) elicits large increases in maximal exercise capacity and small reductions in HR at rest, 2) may increase cardiac vagal tone at rest, 3) does not alter arterial baroreflex control of HR, and 4) results in a diminished forearm vasoconstrictor response to reductions in baroreflex sympathoinhibition.\r"

Oxidative potential as assessed with NADH-tetrazolium reductase and measured microphotometrically increased (P less than 0.05) by 19% in type I fibers but did not change in either the type IIa or type IIb fibers. No effect of training was found when a different oxidative marker, succinic dehydrogenase, was employed.

This analysis was based on the combination of previously obtained scintigraphic data of regional alveolar expansions and of lung shape. This analysis demonstrated that the changes in height were markedly smaller for the apical zones than for the diaphragmatic zones, especially in upright posture but to a smaller extent in head-down posture also. These changes in height in upright posture were attributable to the additive effects of changes in lung shape (which favored larger height changes in the more diaphragmatic zones) and the effects of the changes in regional alveolar expansion (which caused larger volume changes in the diaphragmatic zones). In head-down posture the effects of changes in lung shape (which again favored larger height changes in the diaphragmatic zones except at high volumes) were only partially counteracted by the now inverted changes in alveolar expansion. These height changes were qualitatively in agreement with the cephalad displacement of the minor fissure during lung inflation from residual volume to total lung capacity in both postures, measured previously on chest X-rays. In conclusion, this study shows that the gravitational distributions of alveolar expansion, as assessed by scintigraphy, go along with more complex shape-dependent distributions of regional dimensions and volumes as assessed, e.g., by radiological techniques.\r"

The latter agents produced dual and opposing contractile effects, with DPB being the most potent. Lower doses of DPB (less than or equal to 10(-6) M) elicited significant increases in isometric tension in both untreated TSM, as well as in TSM half-maximally precontracted with methacholine. These potentiated TSM contractions were inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine (10(-4) M) and diltiazem (10(-5) M). In contrast, higher doses of DPB (greater than or equal to 10(-6) M) induced airway relaxation, which was ablated by preinhibition of the electrogenic Na+-K+ pump with ouabain (5 x 10(-6) M) or K+-free buffer. Indeed, in separate experiments DPB (10(-7) M) was found to significantly potentiate the functional activity of the Na+-K+ pump, an effect occurring independent of inhibition of Na+-H+ exchange with amiloride (10(-4) M) or extracellular Ca2+ influx with nifedipine (10(-4) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acetylene washout from the isolated, blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle was measured continuously with a blood gas catheter in combination with a mass spectrometer. The washout curves were transformed to flow-to-volume ratio distributions by means of a 50-compartment model. The algorithm fits the expression for the washout curve derived from the model by a least-squares method with enforced smoothing. The algorithm was evaluated using computer simulations in which artificial washout curves were generated by a multicompartment model with a known flow distribution. A wide range of given flow distributions could be recovered from the simulated data. The data were also analyzed using a linear programming technique. Analysis of the experimental data with the least-squares method showed that there is considerable heterogeneity in the distribution of perfusion in resting gracilis muscle. The distribution is characterized by at least two modes and a single compartment with a very low perfusion-to-volume ratio. Experimental noise made it impossible to obtain feasible flow distributions by means of linear programming.\r"
