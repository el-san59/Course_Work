In this series, fine needle biopsy showed a sensitivity of 75.6% with a 84.1% overall accuracy. Laparoscopy demonstrated a 74.3% sensitivity with an overall accuracy of 82.7%. The combination of both procedures achieved an overall accuracy of 98.4% with a sensitivity of 97.5%. In one case only (hepatic involvement by Hodgkin's lymphoma), both laparoscopy and ultrasonically guided fine needle biopsy failed to establish the diagnosis. In small and deeply located lesions, ultrasonography is the most useful guide for biopsy. Laparoscopy is irreplaceable in the diagnosis of cirrhosis and in hepatic biopsies requiring larger bore needles. With the increasing use of ultrasonically guided fine needle biopsy, laparoscopy finds new indications, particularly in the preoperative staging of small hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

The degree of sedation and cooperation of patients during the procedure and the speed of recovery from sedation were comparable for the two drugs. The effects of both compounds on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were quite similar. However, midazolam induced significantly more amnesia than diazepam (91% vs. 39%). Also, patients' acceptability for the procedure was significantly higher in the midazolam than in the diazepam group (78% vs. 26%). Therefore, when amnesia is desirable, as in the case of repeated endoscopies, midazolam should be the drug of choice.\r"

Visibility was assessed by the amount of bubbles and the degree of haziness noted during colonoscopy. The degree of bubbles was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, and haziness was scored on a scale of 0 to 2. Patients receiving simethicone had significantly less bubbles (p less than 0.001) and less haziness (p less than 0.01) in the colon when compared to placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that the addition of simethicone to the colonic lavage solution results in improved colonic visibility and may result in technically easier and more accurate colonoscopy.\r"

Livers of ducklings, 0 to 17 days posthatch, without viremia were digested ex situ by perfusion of collagenase solution through the portal or hepatic vein. Homogeneous hepatocyte suspensions were seeded into plastic dishes in L-15 medium containing 10(-8) M insulin, 2 X 10(-8) M glucagon and 10(-8) M dexamethasone and were subsequently inoculated with sufficient numbers of duck hepatitis B virus. As a result, duck hepatitis B virus multiplication started weakly on Day 2, gradually increased and reached the maximum level approximately on Day 10 postinoculation. Viral replication was revealed by duck hepatitis B virus DNA in the cell pellet and in the culture medium and duck hepatitis B virus DNA-specific transcripts in the cell pellet. Immunostaining demonstrated duck hepatitis B virus core antigen in approximately 10% of cultured hepatocytes, and an increase in numbers of positive cells was not observed with time for up to 18 days of culture. Viral particles were found within the endoplasmic reticulum, and the inoculation of culture medium provoked viremia in the ducklings. The age of ducklings did not influence the numbers of cells infected. The in vitro infection system was similar to the in vivo one; however, the former seemed to be age-independent and to allow replication of duck hepatitis B virus in the limited number of hepatocytes.\r"

The trial design involved administering azathioprine at a dose of 2 mg per kg to one-half of the patients, in whom prednisolone was then gradually withdrawn, whereas the remaining patients, the \"control\" group, were maintained on the conventional combination regimen of azathioprine (1 mg per kg) with prednisolone. At 1 year there was no significant difference in respect of standard liver function tests or histological appearances between the two groups. Two patients in the azathioprine group required dosage reduction because of myelosuppression and both subsequently relapsed. Following withdrawal of corticosteroids Cushingoid features were lost with a return of weight and blood pressure to normality. In 75% of the patients, corticosteroid withdrawal was marked by arthralgias and myalgias which lasted for up to 12 months: no other major side effects of corticosteroid withdrawal were noted. Thus in the majority of cases, remissions in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis which are induced by corticosteroids can be maintained with azathioprine alone.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested, from studies of a rabbit model of fulminant hepatic failure, that hepatic encephalopathy might be related to an increase in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake through a more permeable bloodbrain barrier, leading to an overactivity of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. Five groups of dogs were studied: normal dogs, dogs with secondary biliary cirrhosis without and with hepatic encephalopathy and portacaval shunted dogs without and with hepatic encephalopathy. Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid and sucrose uptake was investigated using the multiple indicator dilution curve technique in unanesthetized dogs. Tracer doses of 99mTc-labeled albumin (extracellular reference substance), 3H-labeled gamma-aminobutyric acid and 14C-labeled sucrose prepared in autologous dog plasma were injected in one carotid artery, and dorsal sagittal sinus dilution curves were obtained. Uptake was calculated by comparing the areas under the 99mTc-labeled albumin and the [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid (or [14C]sucrose) curves from appearance to peak height. After killing, brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were measured in the frontal cortex by high-performance liquid chromatography and glutamic acid decarboxylase activities using a radioenzymatic assay. Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid postsynaptic receptors were assessed using [3H]muscimol binding studies. There were no significant changes in cirrhotic and shunted dogs with or without hepatic encephalopathy with regard to brain gamma-aminobutyric acid and sucrose uptake, brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels and glutamic acid decarboxylase activities. [3H]Muscimol binding studies did not show any changes in the number nor in the affinity of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An antinuclear immunofluorescence pattern displaying a thin ring confined to the nuclear envelope was assessed in sera from 38 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and in sera from a control group of 277 patients with other antinuclear antibody-positive diseases. This rim-like antinuclear reactivity was present in sera from 20 primary biliary cirrhosis patients (52.6%) but in only two patients from the control group (0.7%) (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, this autoantibody was present in three of four primary biliary cirrhosis patients without antimitochondrial antibodies. Presence of this rim-like pattern in primary biliary cirrhosis did not correlate with the presence of associated autoimmune diseases nor with other clinical, biochemical, nor histological features of the disease. The antigenic specificity of sera displaying this antinuclear immunofluorescence pattern was characterized by Western blot analysis using an antigenic extract containing nuclear envelope proteins purified from rat liver. Sixteen of the 20 positive sera showed a common pattern of reactivity with a set of nuclear envelope-associated proteins approximately 200 kD in size. In conclusion, sera from primary biliary cirrhosis patients showing a rim-like fluorescent nuclear pattern have antinuclear autoantibodies that react specifically with components of the nuclear envelope. The high specificity of these new autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis indicate that they might be a serological marker of the disease, particularly useful in patients without antimitochondrial antibodies.\r"

We also compared the histopathologic features seen in native livers with primary biliary cirrhosis to failed allografts with chronic rejection. One hundred six of the 394 adult patients transplanted during this time (1981 to July, 1986) fulfilled clinicopathologic criteria for a diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. Neither the incidence nor any qualitative pathologic feature of histologically documented acute cellular rejection differentiated subjects transplanted for primary biliary cirrhosis vs. other diseases. No correlation between the titers of antimitochondrial antibody and the presence of posttransplant hepatic dysfunction based on liver enzyme profiles or the development of chronic rejection was seen in patients transplanted for primary biliary cirrhosis. Minor differences noted in the posttransplant course of primary biliary cirrhosis patients as compared to other conditions (higher incidence of chronic rejection as a cause of graft failure) was seen, but this did not significantly affect graft or patient survival. Recurrent primary biliary cirrhosis could not be diagnosed with certainty in any patient. A comparison of failed chronically rejected allografts vs. native hepatectomies obtained from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis revealed the presence of chronic obliterative vasculopathy, centrilobular cholestasis, and lack of granulomas, cirrhosis, cholangiolar proliferation, copper-associated protein deposition and Mallory's hyalin in specimens with chronic rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of the potent, primate selective renin inhibitor A-64662 was studied in monkeys and rats with varying baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) to elucidate the relationship between PRA and the hypotensive response induced by this compound. The effect of a single bolus of vehicle or A-64662 at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg i.v. was compared in 30 normal and 30 salt-depleted, anesthetized monkeys (n = 5/dose). Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was similar among all groups, but baseline PRA was elevated in salt-depleted monkeys. A-64662 induced a comparable dose-related fall in MAP, affecting the magnitude and duration of action, accompanied by inhibition of PRA, the duration of which was dose-related in both the normal and salt-depleted groups. However, the minimum effective doses required to reduce MAP by approximately 10% were 0.01 mg/kg for the salt-depleted monkeys and 0.1 mg/kg for the normal monkeys. In a second study, three consecutive boluses of vehicle or A-64662 at 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg were administered to anephric monkeys, human renin-infused anephric monkeys, and normal monkeys (n = 4/group). A dose of 0.1 mg/kg was ineffective, but the 1.0 mg/kg dose lowered MAP by 11 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE) in the anephric monkeys. The infusion of renin into anephric monkeys restored the efficacy of A-64662 at the 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg doses to responses comparable to those of the normal monkeys. A-64662 at 10.0 mg/kg caused a similar fall in MAP of 50 to 60% in anephric, renin-infused anephric, and normal monkeys in the absence of detectable PRA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purified inactive prorenin was not a substrate for active renin and was not capable of self-activation. Prorenin could be converted to renin by addition of exogenous protease, and deglycosylation of the prorenin did not alter the sensitivity to protease activation. The enzymatic activity of deglycosylated renin was kinetically identical to that of the native protein. Multimilligram quantities of recombinant human renin and prorenin were purified, providing suitable material for studies directed toward greater understanding of the function of these proteins and for structural studies such as x-ray diffraction for use in design of renin inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate factors associated with sodium sensitivity, 157 subjects were studied while receiving 10 and 200 mEq sodium diets. Measurements included blood pressure (BP), forearm vascular resistance, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone. Sodium repletion was associated with a greater than 5% increase in mean BP in 16% of the normotensive subjects and 29% of the borderline hypertensive subjects. Sodium-sensitive subjects were compared with sodium-resistant subjects in both the normotensive (n = 92) and borderline hypertensive (n = 65) groups. Forearm vascular resistance was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) during sodium loading in the sodium-sensitive subgroups of both the normotensive and borderline hypertensive groups (35.8 +/- 29 vs 23.8 +/- 20 [SD] and 37.5 +/- 29 vs 22.5 +/- 14 mm Hg/ml/min/100 g, respectively. Venous capacitance was lower in the sodium-sensitive than in the sodium-resistant borderline hypertensive subjects (0.8 +/- 0.21 vs 1.69 +/- 0.24 ml/100 g). During sodium restriction, PRA was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in the sodium-sensitive subsets (2.56 +/- 1.6 vs 4.04 +/- 2.6; 2.65 +/- 2.1 vs 3.88 +/- 2.6 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr). Aldosterone was lower (p less than 0.01) during sodium depletion in the sodium-sensitive subsets (17.3 +/- 12 vs 26.3 +/- 16; 18.5 +/- 18 vs 27.9 +/- 17 ng/ml). A significant inverse correlation existed between change in BP with sodium repletion and change in PRA or level of PRA during sodium depletion (p less than 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88272455\r", 
  ".W": "It has long been known that increments in renal perfusion pressure can induce an elevation of urine sodium excretion without changing renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. The mechanism underlying this pressure-related natriuresis remains undefined, although the interest in its elucidation has been stimulated by the notion that it may constitute the central phenomenon through which the kidney regulates blood volume and, thereby, blood pressure. Recently, the use of novel experimental techniques has disclosed some important clues about changes in renal hemodynamics that, along with changes in renal humoral regulators, allow us to visualize a possible sequence of events responsible for pressure-related natriuresis. According to this hypothesis, the autoregulatory responses responsible for maintaining glomerular filtration rate are elicited in preglomerular vasculature by changes in renal perfusion pressure. These myogenic responses are coupled through Ca2+ entry in juxtaglomerular cells with inversely related changes in the release of renin and, consequently, with the amount of angiotensin II generated in renal interstitium. The release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells is modulated by the synthesis of prostaglandin I2 from the adjacent endothelial cells. Interstitial angiotensin II could influence sodium tubular reabsorption directly by stimulating sodium transport in proximal renal tubules and indirectly by altering medullary blood flow and, thereby, medullary interstitial pressure. In the renal medulla, the effects of interstitial pressure on sodium reabsorption can be amplified by the release of prostaglandin E2 from interstitial cells. A deficient regulation of this relationship could result in a shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve, leading to hypertension.\r"

One of the causative organisms, Bacteroides oralis, has never previously been described as a pathogen causing mediastinitis after median sternotomy incision. There was associated Bacteroides fragilis bacteremia. Only three cases of Bacteroides species mediastinitis after open heart surgery have been reported. This anaerobic bacterium remains a rare pathogen in median sternotomy infections despite the increasing number of cases of mediastinitis seen in association with the burgeoning number of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Multiple risk factors may contribute to mediastinal infections, which occur in about 2% of patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. When infection occurs, aerobic and anaerobic wound cultures should be made and appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy instituted.\r"

It is widely accepted that prevention is the cornerstone of management for stress ulceration. The critical care nurse must be aware of the importance of monitoring and maintaining a gastric pH greater than 3.5. Antacids, histamine receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and prostaglandins have all been shown to play a role in the treatment of stress ulcerations.\r"

An experimental study was conducted of 20 outpatients with COPD to measure the effect of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on dyspnea and anxiety. Patients were divided into a treatment group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 8). Patients in the treatment group underwent four weekly sessions of live PMR plus daily home practice with taped instructions. The effect of the independent variable, PMR, was measured during each session and at the end of 4 weeks. Measurements were made before and after treatment of the dependent variables, dyspnea and anxiety. Instruments used were Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory for anxiety and a 20 cm visual analogue scale for dyspnea. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were also measured. Data analysis was done by using two-tailed t tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Reductions in anxiety and dyspnea were positively correlated during each session (r = 0.37) and at the end of 4 weeks (r = 0.60). PMR was shown by t tests to be more effective than the control in reducing dyspnea (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.001), RR (p = 0.000), and HR (p = 0.05) during each session but only RR (p = 0.04) at the end of the 4-week period. Dyspnea and RR were correlated positively during each session (r = 0.21). Dyspnea and state anxiety were correlated positively at the end of 4 weeks with RR (r = 0.62) and HR (r = 0.50).\r"

The cellular immune response and rejection process are better understood. This knowledge changed the way existing drugs were used to control rejection and led to the development of new drugs that could more effectively control the rejection process. Early drug protocols used combinations of azathioprine, antilymphocyte globulin, and steroids. Later protocols used combinations of cyclosporine, steroids, and antithymocyte globulin. After problems related to cyclosporine were identified, protocols came full circle. They now include drugs that were used in earlier protocols, as well as cyclosporine. The purpose of this article is to describe how protocols for immunosuppressive therapy have evolved based on our expanded knowledge of immunosuppression and methods of best using new and old drugs to achieve this goal.\r"

The intervention approach to amphotericin B-induced shivering includes reporting the phenomenon, restoring lost heat, modifying the rate of heat loss, altering the physiologic determination of heat loss, and giving drugs to suppress shivering. Specific suggestions for interventions are discussed. Supportive care of the patient with cancer who is receiving this drug is briefly mentioned as it relates to thermoregulatory principles. Possible areas of future inquiry into shivering suppression are mentioned.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of raising tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on rate of edema formation were studied in in situ canine left upper lobe preparations. Edema was induced by increasing blood flow to the left upper lobe (4-8 times normal). In the same animal, at equivalent flows and microvascular hydrostatic pressures, rate of edema formation observed with larger tidal volumes was significantly higher than that observed with smaller tidal volumes (0.73 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.30, P less than 0.001). Edema was also induced under static conditions (i.e., flow = 0) over a wide range of vascular pressures. Rate of edema formation was plotted against pressure and the best-fit linear regression was obtained. The slopes (g.min-1.mmHg-1.100 g-1) of the regression lines were significantly higher with larger tidal volumes compared with smaller tidal volumes [0.106 +/- 0.010 (SE) vs. 0.081 +/- 0.009, P less than 0.01]. The pressure intercepts were not different (16.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 15.7 +/- 1.8). When mean airway pressures were increased to levels equivalent to those obtained with larger tidal volumes, but by raising end-expiratory pressures, rate of edema formation dropped to levels below base line. We conclude that increasing the amplitude of cyclic changes in lung volume increases edema formation through mechanisms that are independent of changes in operating (i.e., mean) lung volume.\r"

Glucose rate of appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) were calculated from plasma glucose enrichment during a primed, continuous infusion of [6,6-2H]glucose. Serum substrates and insulin levels were measured and glycogen content of the vastus lateralis was determined in biopsies taken before and after exercise. At rest, whole-body glucose flux (determined by the deuterated tracer) and carbohydrate oxidation (determined from respiratory exchange ratio) were lower in F than PA, but muscle glycogen levels were similar. During exercise, glucose flux, whole-body carbohydrate oxidation, and the rate of muscle glycogen utilization were significantly lower during the fast. In the PA state, glucose Ra and Rd increased together throughout exercise. However, in the F state Ra exceeded Rd during the 1st h of exercise, causing an increase in plasma glucose to levels similar to those of the PA state. The increase in glucose flux was markedly less throughout F exercise. Lower carbohydrate utilization in the F state was accompanied by higher circulating fatty acids and ketone bodies, lower plasma insulin levels, and the maintenance of physical performance reflected by similar time to exhaustion.\r"

In the present study, the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp procedure was used to determine whether this enhanced insulin action is due to an increased sensitivity and/or an increased responsiveness to insulin. To avoid the variability that exists between individuals and complicates cross-sectional studies, the same subjects were studied in the trained exercising state and again after 10 days of physical inactivity. When the plasma insulin concentration was maintained at approximately 78 microU.ml-1 (a submaximal level), glucose disposal rate averaged 8.7 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1 before and 6.7 +/- 0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1 after 10 days of activity (P less than 0.001). When the plasma insulin concentration was maintained at approximately 2,000 microU.ml-1 (a maximally effective concentration), the rate of glucose disposal was not significantly different before (15.3 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) compared with after (14.5 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1) 10 days without exercise. These results provide evidence that the reversal of enhanced insulin action that occurs within a few days when exercise-trained individuals stop exercising is due to a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, not to a decrease in insulin responsiveness.\r"

NP infused 2.5 h after endotoxin administration immediately reduced mean Ppa from 30 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 3 (SE) cmH2O, PVR from 6.3 +/- 0.7 to 4.8 +/- 0.5 cmH2O.l-1.min, and RL from 340 +/- 48 of base line to 205 +/- 73% and increased Cdyn from 54 +/- 5 of base line to 80 +/- 14% without affecting PAO2--PaO2. Ppa and lung mechanics returned immediately to preinfusion levels when NP was stopped. In vitro experiments with NP showed a dose-dependent relaxation of preconstricted pulmonary artery and vein, carbachol-preconstricted sheep tracheal strips, and bronchial rings. We conclude that NP reverses pulmonary hypertension and lung mechanics abnormalities after endotoxin and that this is due to effects of NP on airway and vascular smooth muscle. The return of these abnormalities after NP cessation suggests the continued presence of vascular and airway-constricting factors late after endotoxin. The lack of effect of NP on blood oxygenation suggests that deleterious effects on hypoxic vasoconstriction are offset by improved lung mechanics.\r"

Endotoxemic pigs were treated with dexamethasone (DEX, iv) 18 h (5 mg/kg) and 1 h (5 mg/kg) before onset of endotoxemia. During phases I (i.e., 0-2 h) and II (i.e., 2-4 h), endotoxin decreased cardiac index, caused granulocytopenia, and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, alveolar-arterial O2 gradient, and hematocrit. During phase II, plasma LTB4 levels were increased (as determined by radioimmunoassay, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet spectroscopy). Endotoxin increased the levels of LTB4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). DEX blocked or greatly attenuated the endotoxin-induced hemodynamic abnormalities and blocked the increases in plasma and BALF LTB4 levels. We conclude that LTB4 is produced during porcine endotoxemia and could possibly play a role in the pathophysiology of endotoxin-induced lung injury in anesthetized pigs.\r"

We evaluated the incidence of deep-wound infection as associated with the magnitude of the operation in 575 patients (659 procedures) who had all three methods of prophylaxis. The same surgeon performed all of the operations. The procedures were divided into five groups, according to the complexity of the operation and the need for major bone-grafting. Only one patient (who had previously had an infection) had early sepsis. After the 376 standard primary operations, the over-all incidence of sepsis (early and late) was 0.38 per cent. No infection occurred after fifty-four complex primary operations without femoral-head autografting. After fifty-nine complex primary operations with femoral-head autografting, three patients had a late deep infection. No infection occurred within two years after the 170 revision operations. There was no late infection after the 104 revisions without major bone-grafting, but late sepsis developed in two patients after the sixty-six revisions with major bone-grafting. Of the total of six cases of late infection in five patients, five had an identifiable source of infection that was extrinsic to the wound. The incidence of early postoperative sepsis after total hip replacement, even complex primary total hip replacement and revision, was extremely low when using the three contemporary methods of prophylaxis for infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six weeks after primary total hip arthroplasty with cement, the femoral component was revised to a titanium fiber-metal prosthesis. On the basis of the type of graft that was impacted into the voids around the ingrowth surface at revision, three study groups were created: no graft (control), four dogs; fresh autograft, six dogs; and frozen allograft, six dogs. Twelve weeks after revision, histological analysis revealed the greatest amount of ingrowth proximally in the grafted specimens. A mean of 22.3 per cent ingrowth was observed in the dogs that had an autograft; this was not significantly different from the mean of 17.5 per cent in those that had an allograft. The non-grafted specimens showed little ingrowth, the values being significantly less than those for the grafted specimens. Push-out testing showed greater ultimate shear strength proximally than distally in the grafted specimens, and at the proximal level there was a significant difference between the group that had an autograft and the control group (mean, 4.03 and 1.22 megapascals, respectively). Ultimate strength correlated positively with ingrowth of bone (r = 0.82). Radiographically, subsidence of the components and lucent lines were observed more frequently in the nongrafted specimens, and if both were present, significantly less ingrowth of bone and strength were observed.\r"

  ".W": "Debridement of the wound and immediate reamed nailing were performed on sixty-seven patients who had an open fracture of the femoral diaphysis. Forty-two of these patients were followed for a minimum of twelve months (average, twenty-three months). Using the classification system of Gustilo and Anderson, there were fifteen (36 per cent) Grade-I, nineteen (45 per cent) Grade-II, and eight (19 per cent) Grade-III soft-tissue injuries. All of the fractures healed within four months after injury. The average flexion of the knee was 127 degrees and that of the hip, 129 degrees. At least 90 degrees of flexion was achieved in both joints of all patients. Perioperative complications included loss of fixation in four patients (10 per cent), infection of the wound in two patients (5 per cent), a wound seroma in two patients (5 per cent), and thrombophlebitis in one patient (2 per cent). Late complications were angular malunion in three patients (7 per cent), limb-length discrepancy in three patients (7 per cent), external rotation malunion in one patient (2 per cent), and sciatic-nerve palsy in one patient (2 per cent). We concluded that immediate intramedullary nailing of an open femoral fracture can be accomplished safely, with an acceptable rate of complications, given thorough debridement of the wound, proper equipment, and an experienced surgical team.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamines and endogenous opioid peptides are released in response to stress. Exogenous infusions of epinephrine and beta-endorphin (both in doses of 15, 50, and 80 ng/kg.min sequentially, each dose lasting 30 min) were used to mimic short term stress in both normal weight (body mass index, less than 25 kg/m2) and obese (body mass index, greater than 30 kg/m2) subjects. Fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide, and beta-endorphin concentrations were significantly higher in the obese than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.01-0.005). In lean subjects epinephrine produced significant increases in plasma glucose levels, but no appreciable changes in plasma insulin, C-peptide, or glucagon. Infusion of beta-endorphin in the same subjects caused plasma glucose and glucagon to rise, but insulin and C-peptide levels did not change. The simultaneous infusion of epinephrine and beta-endorphin produced a glycemic response which, although greater, was not significantly different than the sum of the responses to the individual hormone infusions. However, the two hormones had a synergistic interaction on plasma glucagon levels [total glucagon response, 2275 +/- 370 pg/min.mL (ng/min.L); sum of single effects, 750 +/- 152 (+/- SE) pg/min.mL (ng/min.L); P less than 0.01]. The plasma epinephrine [207 +/- 21, 607 +/- 70, and 1205 +/- 134 pg/mL (1130 +/- 115, 3640 +/- 382, and 6577 +/- 691 pmol/L] and beta-endorphin [875 +/- 88, 1250 +/- 137, and 1562 +/- 165 pg/mL (250 +/- 25, 358 +/- 39, and 447 +/- 47 pmol/L] concentrations attained during the infusions of each single hormone were not different from those recorded during the combined hormonal infusion. In obese subjects epinephrine raised plasma glucose levels and caused dose-related increments of plasma glucagon concentrations. Plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations remained low and rebounded at the end of the infusions. In the same subjects, beta-endorphin produced elevations of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon. When the combined hormonal infusion was given to obese subjects, the plasma epinephrine and beta-endorphin concentrations rose to values not significantly different from those in normal weight subjects. However, there was a dramatic increase in plasma glucose exceeding 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), which remained elevated 30 min after the infusion. The glucagon response was not greater than the sum of the single effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated in unpaired studies that corn oil ingestion at the beginning of a euglycemic insulin clamp study decreased the responsiveness of gluteal adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (ATLPL) to glucose/insulin in lean subjects. In this investigation, we performed paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies with glucose/insulin with or without oral corn oil in each of six lean [mean, 64 +/- 3 (+/- SE) kg] normal women and nine moderately obese (91 +/- 3 kg) women before and after 12.4 +/- 1.4-kg weight loss and 3 months of weight maintenance to determine if the inhibitory effect of fat calories existed in each of these states. In the obese women the fasting ATLPL activity [5.6 +/- 1.1 (+/- SE) neq FFA/10(6) cells.min] was greater than in the normal women (1.6 +/- 0.2) and did not change after weight loss and maintenance (5.0 +/- 0.7). As expected, in normal women corn oil ingestion diminished the responsiveness of ATLPL to glucose/insulin [change (delta), 0.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.8; P less than 0.02] during a 6-h euglycemic insulin (40 mU/m2.min) clamp. In obese women ATLPL activity did not change under either experimental condition (glucose/insulin with or without corn oil). However, after weight reduction ATLPL activity increased not only in response to glucose/insulin alone (delta, 7.7 +/- 2.4), but also in response to glucose/insulin when corn oil was ingested (delta, 7.9 +/- 2.8). Moreover, the response of ATLPL activity to glucose/insulin and corn oil was greater than that in lean women (P less than 0.05). Thus, in reduced-obese women not only did fasting ATLPL activity remain elevated and ATLPL responsiveness to glucose/insulin increase, but fat ingestion failed to blunt the ATLPL response. This inability of dietary fat to diminish the responsiveness of ATLPL to glucose/insulin and, therefore, the effect of the lipase on triglyceride deposition in adipose tissue could contribute to the resumption of the obese state that so commonly occurs after successful weight reduction.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of administration of a GnRH antagonist combined with testosterone (T) as an approach to male contraception as well as the role of intratesticular androgens in spermatogenesis using a nonhuman primate model. Three groups of five adult cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) received daily sc injections of 420-460 micrograms/kg GnRH antagonist ([Ac-D2Nal1,D4ClPhe2,DPal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA), DALa10]GnRH) for a period of 15 weeks. T supplementation, commencing on the first day of GnRH antagonist administration, was provided by single im injection of 40 mg (group 2) or 200 mg (group 3) of the long-acting testosterone ester testosterone-trans-4-n-butylcyclohexancarboxylate (20-Aet-1). Serum LH bioactivity was undetectable within 1 week of GnRH antagonist administration in all monkeys. GnRH antagonist administration alone (group 1) reduced serum T levels into the castrate range. Forty milligrams of 20-Aet-1 maintained serum T levels in the upper range of normal monkeys, while 200 mg 20-Aet-1 maintained serum T levels about 1.5-fold above normal. The response to electroejaculation was fully maintained in all T-treated monkeys. Sperm counts in the ejaculates dropped to zero among group 1 animals within 7-10 weeks of GnRH antagonist administration. In groups 2 and 3 consistent azoospermia could not be induced, and the sperm counts were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in group 3 than in group 2. Histologically, spermatogenesis in group 1 was arrested at the spermatogonial level in 75% of seminiferous tubules. In group 2, spermatogenesis proceeded to spermatocytes in 50% of tubules and to elongated spermatids in 10% of tubules, while in group 3 elongation of spermatids occurred in 75% of tubules. The mean T and dihydrotestosterone concentrations in baseline testicular biopsies (n = 15) were 43.8 +/- 6.8 (+/- SE) and 5.7 +/- 1.5 ng/g, respectively. After GnRH antagonist with or without T administration, the mean (n = 15) intratesticular T and dihydrotestosterone levels were reduced to 20.3 +/- 4.9 and 3.2 +/- 0.5 ng/g, respectively, and differed little among the three groups. No correlation, however, could be established between testicular androgen levels and spermatogenic status (P greater than 0.30) or sperm counts (P greater than 0.60). These results demonstrate that administration of a GnRH antagonist in the presence of constant serum T levels does not induce consistent azoospermia, and that the supporting effects of T on spermatogenesis cannot be explained exclusively on the basis of the testicular androgen concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral plasma or serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and cortisol and insulin secretory rates (ISR) were determined at 15-min intervals in eight normal subjects during a constant iv infusion of 4.5 mg glucose/kg.min for a 24-h period. During each sampling interval, the secretory rate of insulin was calculated by deconvolution of the peripheral plasma C-peptide concentration using C-peptide kinetic parameters derived after bolus injections of C-peptide in individual subjects. Periodogram analysis of the individual glucose curves demonstrated a circadian rhythm in all subjects, with a major nocturnal acrophase occurring at an average clock time of 0228 h (range, 0045-0350 h). In five of the eight subjects, a minor acrophase occurred at an average time of 1774 h (range, 1530-2045 h). This diurnal variation in plasma glucose levels was not paralleled by a similar pattern in insulin secretion. Although glucose was infused at a constant rate, significant pulses were found in glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels and ISR; the pulse durations of these parameters were 182 +/- 30 (+/- SE), 89 +/- 5, 100 +/- 8, and 85 +/- 5 min, respectively, and their periodicities were 208 +/- 33, 106 +/- 7, 114 +/- 10, and 106 +/- 7 min. The durations and frequencies for pulses of insulin, C-peptide, and ISR were not significantly different, whereas glucose pulses had a longer duration and were less frequent (P less than 0.05, by analysis of variance). On the average, 54 +/- 9% of the C-peptide pulses and 47 +/- 8% of the ISR pulses were concomitant with a pulse in glucose levels. Moreover, approximately half of the C-peptide and ISR pulses that were not concomitant with a glucose pulse occurred in synchrony with a shoulder on the up-stroke or down-stroke of glucose pulses. Analysis of glucagon and cortisol profiles revealed no significant associations with the insulin and glucose oscillations. In conclusion, during a constant glucose infusion in normal subjects, regular oscillations of insulin secretion occur at 80- to 120-min intervals. Their tight coupling with glucose oscillations and the lack of association with fluctuations of glucagon and cortisol suggest that these oscillations represent a dynamic property of the insulin-glucose feedback loop.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade several corticosteroid-dependent, low mol wt proteins with phospholipase-A2 (PLA2) inhibitory activity have been described. This family of proteins is collectively known as lipocortins. Blastokinin or uteroglobin (utg), a progesterone-induced protein, first discovered in the pregnant rabbit uterus, is also a potent PLA2 inhibitor, but genetically distinct from lipocortins. Although utg has been found in rabbits, its presence in humans has not been well established. Here, we present biochemical, immunological, and immunohistological evidence for the detection of a utg-like protein in the human uterus. Since inhibition of PLA2 may modulate tissue eicosanoid levels and since rabbit utg has been reported to be a potent PLA2 inhibitor, we also studied the temporal relationship between utg and tissue prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha levels in estrogen- and progesterone-dominated endometrial tissue. We found an inverse temporal relationship between utg-like protein and eicosanoid levels in this organ. Since some eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc.) are known to be involved in smooth muscle contractility and inflammatory processes, our findings may help to understand the pathogenesis of some human disorders in which abnormal eicosanoid production occurs.\r"

Immunohistochemical localization was quantified as to intensity of staining and tissue distribution in glandular epithelium, stroma, and myometrium, and the results were compared with those of standard ligand binding assays. In all samples ER and PgR localized within the nuclei of target cells. The maximal concentrations of ER and PgR occurred in the mid- to late proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. ER content declined throughout the secretory phase. In contrast, PgR content underwent unexpectedly complex and dyssynchronous fluctuations during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Specifically, the glandular epithelium had diminished PgR content, while the stroma and myometrium maintained a significant PgR content. PgR and perhaps ER are not concordant in different cell types within the uterus. Segregation of function through alteration of receptor content may be an important mechanism in steroid-dependent growth and differentiation of target tissues.\r"

We also used a primary culture system for female virgin rat adipocytes to assess the effects of gestational hormones in vitro on insulin binding and postbinding function. Insulin binding to adipocytes was normal during pregnancy, but [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was reduced. When hCG or estradiol was added to the culture medium, no change in maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was found; however, maximum insulin binding was increased with estradiol. Progesterone and cortisol both decreased maximum insulin binding and [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport. PRL and placental lactogen decreased maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport, but did not change insulin binding. When these hormones were added concurrently no change in insulin binding was found, but maximum [14C]3-O-methylglucose transport was reduced. We conclude that the insulin resistance of pregnancy is associated with a postbinding defect in insulin action. Estradiol increased insulin receptor binding, but during pregnancy this effect may be offset by the reduction in insulin binding induced by progesterone and cortisol. The postbinding defect in insulin action during pregnancy is probably related to increasing amounts of progesterone, cortisol, PRL, and placental lactogen.\r"

Serum midregion PTH was determined by RIA, and serum intact PTH was measured by a sensitive and specific immunoradiometric two-site assay. The serum intact PTH concentrations in 70 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were above the normal range in 69, and thus widely separated from the levels in 40 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, in whom serum intact PTH values were usually below normal. In contrast, both groups had overlapping serum midregion PTH values. In patients after renal transplantation and those with chronic renal failure, serum intact PTH levels were in the normal range twice as often as were serum midregion PTH values. The intact PTH assay was also superior in detecting venous gradients of the hormone and changes in PTH secretion caused by altered serum calcium concentrations, and serum intact PTH was remarkably low in hepatic venous effluent. We conclude that this new assay for serum intact PTH is superior to the midregion RIA in investigating parathyroid function in several different clinical conditions.\r"

Treatment was discontinued at a mean age of 11.6 +/- 1.3 (+/- SD) yr. Plasma hormone levels, growth velocity, rate of bone maturation, and pubertal stage were assessed at the end of treatment and 3 and 12 months later. Basal plasma sex steroid and basal and LHRH-stimulated gonadotropin levels returned to near-pretreatment levels 3 months after discontinuation of therapy and were fully restored to pretreatment levels at 12 months. Growth velocity, which had been 7.8 cm/yr before treatment, was stable after discontinuation of treatment at approximately 2.6 cm/yr. The predicted height, which had increased during treatment (P less than 0.01), remained stable at approximately 5 cm above the pretreatment predicted height. The rate of bone age advancement (delta bone age/delta chronological age) increased gradually from 0.4 at the end of treatment to the normal value of 0.9 12 months posttreatment. Breast and pubic hair pubertal stages, which were stable throughout treatment and were 4.0 +/- 0.8 (+/- SD) and 3.6 +/- 1.0 at the end of treatment, increased to 4.9 +/- 0.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.0. This approximated the normal rate of 1 stage/yr. Menses occurred in 8 of 12 girls within 1 yr after treatment and in an additional 3 by 20 months after treatment. Six of the girls had menstruated before treatment, and all of these menstruated within 14 months after discontinuing therapy. We conclude that gonadotropin and sex steroid secretion and the clinical progression through puberty appear to resume normally after discontinuation of long term LHRHa treatment of central precocious puberty. Long term follow-up will be required, however, to determine whether the improvement in predicted height of these patients will be achieved, and whether adult reproductive function will be normal.\r"

While ethanol increased fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations, after insulin administration plasma glucose concentrations fell to similar nadirs in the ethanol [2.5 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) mmol/L] and control studies (2.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L). The hypoglycemia-induced serum GH, cortisol, and glucagon responses were all reduced (P less than 0.05-0.005) during the ethanol study, while the rises in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were similar in both studies. After discontinuation of the insulin infusions, the initial recovery from hypoglycemia occurred sooner in the presence than in the absence of ethanol. These data indicate that ethanol facilitates the recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the face of reduced counterregulatory hormones responses. Thus, other mechanisms, such as ethanol-induced insulin resistance, may be important in facilitating the recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia during ethanol administration.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin (SRIH) infusion has been widely used in metabolic studies of carbohydrate metabolism. While the effects of SRIH itself on various aspects of carbohydrate economy have been assessed in young adults, such studies have not been conducted in the elderly, which represent an increasingly important study group. To examine the effect of SRIH on insulin-mediated glucose disposal in the elderly, we studied 12 (7 men and 5 women) healthy nonobese subjects, aged 65-80 yr. Paired 3-h euglycemic insulin clamp studies were performed in random order employing insulin alone (22 mU/m2.min) or insulin with SRIH (250 micrograms/h) and glucagon (0.4 ng/kg.min) to maintain normal basal plasma glucagon levels. Basal plasma insulin, glucose, glucagon, GH, and glucose production and disappearance were similar on each occasion. Steady state (10-180 min) mean plasma insulin [insulin alone, 298 +/- 12 (+/- SE); insulin; glucagon, and SRIH, 304 +/- 15 pmol/L] and glucagon (insulin alone, 85 +/- 7; insulin, glucagon, and SRIH, 96 +/- 9 ng/L) concentrations were similar. At steady state (150-180 min) glucose production was suppressed to similar levels (insulin alone, 26 +/- 7; insulin, glucagon, and SRIH, 36 +/- 13 mumol/kg.min). However, steady state glucose disposal was significantly higher during the SRIH infusion (insulin alone, 295 +/- 26; insulin, glucagon, and SRIH, 346 +/- 32 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.02). We conclude that SRIH augments insulin-mediated glucose disposal in healthy older subjects at physiological levels of insulin.\r"

We considered the possibility that known cytokines might possess such activity on human basophils and/or mast cells and therefore tested preparations of human recombinant IL 3, IL 4, IL 5, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) upon a panel of basophil donors. IL 3 and GM-CSF possessed significant histamine-releasing activity in 8 of 10 and 12 of 14 subjects, respectively. In each instance, a dose response could be demonstrated. IL 4 and G-CSF had no such activity, whereas IL 5 had activity in only 2 of 14 donors tested. We conclude that IL 3 and GM-CSF represent two effective HRFs, and suggest that HRF, as isolated based upon histamine-releasing activity, is likely to be heterogeneous in terms of molecular identity. Whether previously described HRFs relate specifically to IL 3 or GM-CSF must await primary sequence analysis of HRF and/or studies with monospecific antisera.\r"

  ".U": "88273575\r", 
  ".W": "The changes in hepatic glucose production (Ra), tissue glucose disposal (Rd), and plasma glucose and insulin concentration that took place over a 16-h period from 10 to 2 p.m. were documented in 14 individuals; 8 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and 6 with normal glucose tolerance. Values for Ra were higher than normal in patients with NIDDM at 10 p.m. (4.73 +/- 0.41 vs. 3.51 +/- 0.36 mg/kg per min, P less than 0.001), but fell at a much faster rate throughout the night than that seen in normal subjects. As a consequence, the difference between Ra in normal individuals and patients with NIDDM progressively narrowed, and by 2 p.m., had ceased to exist (1.75 +/- 0.61 vs. 1.67 +/- 0.47 mg/kg per min, P = NS). Plasma glucose concentration also declined in patients with NIDDM over the same period of time, but they remained quite hyperglycemic, and the value of 245 +/- 27 mg/dl at 2 p.m. was about three times greater than in normal individuals. Plasma insulin concentrations also fell progressively from 10 to 2 p.m., and were similar in both groups throughout most of the 16-h study period. Thus, the progressive decline in Ra in patients with NIDDM occurred despite concomitant falls in both plasma glucose and insulin concentration. Glucose disposal rates also fell progressively in both groups, but the magnitude of the fall was greater in patients with NIDDM. Consequently, Rd in patients with NIDDM was higher at 10 p.m. (3.97 +/- 0.48 vs. 3.25 +/- 0.13 mg/kg per min, P less than 0.001) and lower the following day at 2 p.m. (1.64 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.35 mg/kg per min, P less than 0.01). These results indicate that a greatly expanded pool size can exist in patients with NIDDM at a time when values for Ra are identical to those in normal subjects studied under comparable conditions, which suggests that fasting hyperglycemia in NIDDM is not simply a function of an increase in Ra.\r"

  ".U": "88273582\r", 
  ".W": "Plasma samples were obtained from 34 bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients before and after administration of the preparative regimen and tested for their ability to promote and/or support growth of hemopoietic colonies. The ability of plasma samples to promote colony formation on their own was tested on normal nonadherent target cells without addition of exogenous growth factors. The growth-supporting activity was examined in the presence of medium conditioned by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocytes (PHA-LCM) and/or erythropoietin (EPO). A series of kinetic changes was routinely observed. Pretransplant samples rarely gave rise to colonies without addition of exogenous growth factors. Plasma samples obtained after completion of the preparative regimen demonstrated increments of growth-promoting activities for megakaryocyte and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-Meg and CFU-GM), respectively, that peaked between 7 and 21 d after transplantation. By day 30, activity levels of some patients had returned to pretransplant values, whereas in other patients, activities remained elevated. Persisting activity levels were associated with delayed engraftment. In contrast, activities for progenitors committed to erythropoiesis (BFU-E) and pluripotent precursors (CFU-GEMM) were only rarely observed. The activities were independent of febrile episodes. Their growth-promoting influence on CFU-GM could be neutralized completely by anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies. These data suggest that at least some of the observed activities in post-BMT plasma are related to GM-CSF. The growth-supporting activities of pretransplant plasma samples are lower than normal plasma when tested on CFU-Meg and CFU-GM. The growth-supporting activities improved transiently within the first month after BMT. A decline during the second and third month was followed by a gradual return to activity levels that were comparable to normal plasma. The effects of these plasma samples on BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were assessed with PHA-LCM and EPO. Similar to CFU-Meg- and CFU-GM-supporting capabilities, they improved transiently after BMT with a return of normal support function after 5-6 mo. The observed endogenous production of growth-promoting and growth-supporting activities for hemopoietic progenitors may serve as a background to design clinical trials for the timely administration of recombinant hemopoietic growth factors to BMT recipients.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to test whether there are diurnal changes in the firing rate of sympathetic nerves to brown adipose tissue and whether these diurnal rhythms influenced the response to insulin injected into the suprachiasmatic nucleus or ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). Food intake was highest at the beginning of the dark period (1800-2200 hours) and lowest during the daylight hours (0600-1000 and 1200-1600 hours). The basal sympathetic firing rate was highest at noon (1000-1200 hours) when food intake was lowest. At midnight, when food intake was highest, sympathetic firing rate was lowest. Injection of insulin (77, 144, and 288 pmol) into the VMH produced a dose-dependent depression of sympathetic firing rate at each of the four measurement periods (0400-0600 hours, 1000-1200 hours, 1600-1800 hours, and 2200-2400 hours), but the magnitude of the effect was greater at noon than at night. In contrast, insulin injections into the suprachiasmatic nucleus decreased the sympathetic firing rate at noon but produced a significant increase in the sympathetic firing rate at night. These data show that a diurnal rhythm exists for the sympathetic firing rate. The decrease in firing rate in response to insulin when injected into the VMH is in the same direction but varies in magnitude throughout the day, whereas the responsiveness of the suprachiasmatic nucleus to injections of insulin shows a reversal of response in relation to day/night cycles. The highly significant inverse relationship between basal sympathetic firing rate and food intake suggests that sympathetic activity may be part of an important control system for energy balance.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiological significance of the glucose-fatty acid cycle in skeletal muscle in vivo is uncertain. We have examined the short term effects of increased availability of nonesterified FFA on tissue-specific glucose uptake and storage in rat tissues in vivo basally and during a hyperinsulinemic (150 mU/liter) euglycemic clamp. Circulating FFA were elevated to 2 mmol/liter (FFA 1) or 4 mmol/liter (FFA 2). Elevated FFA produced a dose-dependent inhibition of myocardial glucose utilization in both basal (FFA1, 42%; FFA2, 68%; P less than 0.001, by analysis of variance) and clamp groups (FFA1, 39%; FFA2, 49%; P less than 0.001) and also suppressed brown adipose tissue glucose utilization during the clamp (-42%, P less than 0.001). In contrast to heart, glucose utilization in skeletal muscle was suppressed by FFA only in the FFA1 basal group (-36%, P less than 0.001); in other groups (e.g., FFA2 clamp) elevated FFA produced increased skeletal muscle glucose utilization (+68%, P less than 0.001) that was directed toward glycogen (+175%, P less than 0.05) and lipid deposition (+125%, P less than 0.005). FFA stimulated basal glucose utilization in white (e.g., FFA2, +220%, P less than 0.005) and brown adipose tissue (e.g., FFA2, +200%, P less than 0.005). Thus elevated FFA can acutely inhibit glucose utilization in skeletal muscle in addition to cardiac muscle in vivo supporting a possible role for the glucose-fatty acid cycle in skeletal muscle in acute insulin resistance. However, at high levels or with elevated insulin, FFA stimulates glucose utilization and storage in skeletal muscle. By promoting accumulation of glucose storage products, chronic elevation of FFA may lead to skeletal muscle (and therefore whole body) insulin resistance.\r"

To determine the cellular mechanism of action of these growth factors, we measured changes in intracellular free calcium concentration [( Cac]) in single human erythroid precursors in response to recombinant erythropoietin and GM-CSF. [Cac] in immature erythroblasts derived from cultured human cord blood erythroid progenitors was measured with fluorescence microscopy digital video imaging. When stimulated with erythropoietin, [Cac] in the majority of erythroblasts increased within 3 min, peaked at 5 min, and returned toward baseline at 10 min. The percentage of cells that responded to erythropoietin stimulation increased in a dose-dependent manner. Additional stimulation with GM-CSF in cells previously exposed to erythropoietin resulted in a second [Cac] increase. Immature erythroblasts treated with GM-CSF followed by erythropoietin responded similarly to each factor with a rise in [Cac]. The source of transient calcium is intracellular since erythroblasts were incubated in medium devoid of extracellular calcium. Our observations suggest that changes in [Cac] may be an intracellular signal that mediates the proliferative/differentiating effect of hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

Expressed as percent change, anterograde infusion of insulin antibody increased efflux concentrations of glucagon (110 +/- 20%, P less than 0.0005) and somatostatin (2,112 +/- 73%, P less than 0.0005) above their respective control. Retrograde infusion of insulin antibody did not affect efflux concentrations of glucagon (P less than 0.50) or somatostatin (P less than 0.50). The anterograde infusion of anti-somatostatin antibody had no effect upon insulin (P less than 0.50) or glucagon (P less than 0.50) efflux concentrations, whereas retrograde anti-somatostatin antibody infusion produced immediate increases in efflux concentrations of both insulin (115 +/- 33%, P less than 0.0005) and glucagon (77 +/- 8%, P less than 0.0005). These results strongly suggest that (a) the vascular compartment is important in the regulation of intra-islet cellular interactions and further suggest that (b) the order of islet cellular perfusion and interaction is from the B cell core outward to the mantle, and (c) the mantle is further subordered with the majority of D cells downstream or distal to the majority of A cells. Thus, in the vascular compartment, B cells inhibit A-cell secretion and A cells stimulate D-cell secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on growth of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines was studied. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates of cell lines NCI-H345 and NCI-N417 demonstrated the presence of a 16-kD band consistent with an IGF-I precursor molecule. Scatchard plot analysis of cell line NCI-H345 using 125I-labeled IGF-I demonstrated two high affinity specific binding sites (Kd 1.3 and 4.0 nM with maximal rate (Bmax) 200 and 500 fmol/mg protein, respectively). The exogenous addition of IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin resulted in marked proliferation of human SCLC cells as evaluated using an in vitro growth assay. These peptides stimulated the growth of SCLC cell lines NCI-H82, NCI-H209, NCI-H345, and NCI-N417. The concentration of IGF-I producing maximal SCLC cell growth was 10-100-fold less than that of insulin or IGF-II, whereas the maximal growth stimulated by the optimal concentration of these peptides were similar. An MAb that specifically binds to the IGF-I receptor (but not to the insulin receptor) mediates a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth in basal media as well as IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin-supplemented media. The IGF-I receptor thus appears to be the common pathway for the mitogenic activity by IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin for human SCLC cell lines. The demonstration of an IGF-I precursor molecule, specific IGF-I receptor binding, IGF-I-mediated growth stimulation, and inhibition of basal cell growth by an MAb to the IGF-I receptor suggests that an IGF-I-like molecule can function in vitro as an autocrine growth factor for human SCLC cell lines.\r"

Diabetic rats were characterized by their significantly elevated serum glucose, apo B, and triglyceride levels, while serum insulin levels were less than a third of normal. Serum transminase activities of diabetic rats were significantly elevated when compared with control rats, which was attributed to an increase in liver transaminase activity in diabetic rats. The pattern of enzyme activities of hepatocytes reflected that observed in livers of donor rats and the pattern was retained by primary cultures of hepatocytes over the culture period. Hepatocytes from diabetic rats secreted only one third of the apo B secreted by hepatocytes from control rats, which was determined by monoclonal immunoassay of rat total apo B. Decreases in secretion were confirmed by measurement of secretory [35S]methionine-labeled lipoprotein apo B radioactivity. The decreased apo B content of media of hepatocytes from diabetic rats was not due to increased apo B catabolism since hepatocytes from diabetic rats were shown to degrade less lipoprotein-apo B than hepatocytes from normal rats in control experiments. In addition, the apo B content of detergent-solubilized hepatocytes from diabetic rats was significantly less than that of hepatocytes from control rats. These results suggest that insulin is necessary for normal hepatic apo B synthesis and secretion and that the hyperlipidemia associated with hypoinsulinemia in vivo is primarily of intestinal origin.\r"

  ".W": "Annual coronary arteriograms have been obtained from all heart transplant recipients at Stanford University Medical Center since 1969. Angiographic lesions in 81 transplant patients exhibiting coronary vascular disease were classified into three categories: type A, discrete or tubular stenoses; type B, diffuse concentric narrowing; and type C, narrowed irregular vessels with occluded branches. The 81 arteriograms showing transplant coronary vascular disease were contrasted with 32 from nontransplant patients with coronary artery disease analyzed in a similar fashion. The nontransplant angiograms showed 178 lesions, all of type A (discrete or tubular) morphology, 75% of which were located in primary epicardial coronary vessels and 25% in secondary branch vessels. In the patients with transplant coronary vascular disease, 349 (76%) of 461 lesions were type A: 57% in primary vessels, 42% in secondary branches and 1.4% in tertiary branches. Of the 112 type B and C lesions (diffuse narrowing, tapering and obliteration), 25% were in primary vessels, 44% in secondary vessels and 31% in tertiary branches (p less than 0.05 for patients with transplant coronary vascular disease versus patients with nontransplant coronary artery disease). Total vessel occlusion was found in proximal or middle vessel segments in 96% and distally in 4% of patients with \"ordinary\" coronary artery disease versus 49% distally in patients with transplant coronary disease (p less than 0.002). In the presence of total vessel occlusion, collateral vessels were poor or absent in 92% of transplant versus 7% of nontransplant patients with coronary disease (p less than 0.002). Therefore, coronary artery disease in transplant patients represents a mixture of typical atheromatous lesions and unique transplant-related progressive distal obliterative disease that occurs without collateral vessel development.\r"

Patients were monitored for 24 h. The major end points were sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation and emergent adverse effects of lidocaine. There were four episodes of emergent adverse effects of lidocaine, all in patients treated by the prophylactic strategy (2.4%, p = NS). There were two episodes of nonagonal, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, both in patients treated by the selective strategy (1.2%, p = NS). The difference between major end points was 1.2% in favor of the selective strategy (p = NS). There were significant differences in lesser ventricular arrhythmias and lesser lidocaine adverse effects but no difference in mortality rate (selective = 3%, prophylactic = 5%, p = NS). Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias occurred only in patients with myocardial infarction. Nonlethal but complex ventricular arrhythmias were rare in patients without infarction. However, toxicity occurred in patients with and without infarction. The major conclusion of this study is that there is no important overall advantage of either strategy for lidocaine use in such patients. The advantage of one is the risk of the other. The strategy used should be selected for individual patients, and the use of one strategy for all patients would seem inappropriate.\r"

Of 18 ragweed-allergic individuals tested, 11 developed both an immediate and a late-phase reaction (LPR) with fivefold-elevated levels of histamine (40 ng/ml) at 30 minutes and a peak level of PGD2 (6.5 ng/ml) later at 2 1/2 hours after ragweed challenge. The other seven allergic individuals had immediate reactions without an LPR lesion and demonstrated somewhat smaller elevations of histamine (25 ng/ml) but much lower levels of PGD2 (1.6 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). The time course of appearance of these mediators was identical in both groups of patients. The fluids from unchallenged blisters of allergic and nonallergic patients and the fluids of nonallergic patients challenged with ragweed had similar levels of histamine, at the lower limit of detection, and undetectable PGD2 levels. The peak levels of PGD2 in allergic individuals correlated with the size of the LPR lesion (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that the LPR involves the secondary elaboration of mediators different from mediators responsible for the immediate manifestations of the allergic skin reaction.\r"

Symptomatic and disseminated CMV diseases were more common when patients developed primary infection (P less than .01, for both comparisons). The donor organ appeared to be the only important source of CMV infection in seronegative recipients. The use of OKT3 antibodies was associated with disseminated CMV disease in patients with primary infection (P = .04) but not with reactivation infection (P greater than .10). Although most HSV infections were oral or genital reactivations, three cases of HSV hepatitis occurred--one was a primary infection. Symptomatic reactivations of HSV were observed in 53% of HSV-seropositive recipients who received OKT3, versus 31% of seropositive recipients who did not receive OKT3 (P = .05).\r"

BKV infection rates were not influenced by the source of the renal allograft (cadaver versus living related donor); however, primary JCV infections occurred more often in recipients of seropositive cadaveric kidneys. Reactivated JCV infections occurred less frequently in patients treated with antilymphocyte preparation. BKV and JCV infections in renal transplant recipients may be caused either by reactivation of the recipient's latent virus or by virus from the donor kidney. These infections are, however, not associated with adverse outcome (death, high serum creatinine level, or loss of renal function) in the recipient in the early post-transplant period.\r"

Penicillin was ineffective unless given at the time of bacterial injection, and treatment delays of 2 h reduced its efficacy such that survival was no better than that of untreated control animals (P less than .05). Survival of erythromycin-treated mice was greater than that of both penicillin-treated mice and untreated controls, but only if treatment was begun within 2 h. Mice receiving clindamycin, however, had survival rates of 100%, 100%, 80%, and 70% even if treatment was delayed 0, 2, 6, and 16.5 h, respectively. Thus, clindamycin demonstrated superior efficacy to penicillin among all the various treatment groups (P less than .05). Our results corroborate the failure of penicillin in this model of streptococcal infection and suggest that, unlike penicillin, the efficacy of clindamycin is not adversely altered by the \"Eagle effect.\"\r"

Episodes of bacteriuria in 1473 children were followed prospectively from 1970 to 1984. To study the inflammatory response to the bacteriuric epidoses, we recorded body temperature, C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte count, and renal concentrating capacity. Bacterial isolates from each episode were identified and saved, and the adhesive capacity of 2669 E. coli strains was defined by their binding to galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-containing receptors. Inflammatory response was significantly higher and renal concentrating capacity significantly lower during episodes caused by attaching strains. There was a linear relation between the number of indicators of inflammation and the proportion of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-binding strains present. Vesicoureteric reflux potentiated the inflammatory response. Attaching strains of E. coli thus appeared to be more capable of causing inflammation than were other bacteria. The potentiating effect of attachment on inflammation explains the over-representation of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-recognizing bacteria in patients with acute pyelonephritis.\r"

The strains were negative by tests with DNA probes for enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli and, by serotype, did not fit these categories. Thirty-nine of 42 strains had a 55-65-megadalton plasmid; many shared DNA homology. With one representative strain, plasmid transfer was accompanied by transfer of smooth lipopolysaccharide, fimbriae expression, and the aggregative property. EA-AggEC caused characteristic lesions in rabbit and rat ileal loops. The intestinal lesions and (Shiga-like) limb paralysis and death in rabbits inoculated with live organisms suggest toxin involvement; assays for Shiga-like toxins were negative. These preliminary results support the contention that EA-AggEC may represent a distinct category of diarrheagenic E. coli.\r"

Because P. aeruginosa adheres better to cell surfaces devoid of fibronectin, we searched for fibronectin-cleaving activity in bronchial secretions and saliva from 24 patients with cystic fibrosis who were followed up for 4.5 y and from two control groups. Proteolytic activity against 125I-labeled fibronectin was continuously present in cystic fibrosis bronchial secretions; significantly higher fibronectin-cleaving activity was found in older vs. younger patients, in patients with advanced disease stages determined by a five-stage scoring system, and in those colonized with P. aeruginosa. The fibronectin-cleaving activity was due to neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. Cystic fibrosis bronchial secretions had proteolytic activity against surface fibronectin of airway mucosal cells. Thus fibronectin-cleaving activity of bronchial secretions rather than of saliva may favor P. aeruginosa colonization of the upper respiratory tract in individuals with cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The function of the insulin receptor subunits isolated from cells of a patient with the type A syndrome of insulin resistance was examined. Iodine 125-labeled insulin binding, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both endogenous and exogenous substrates, and internalization of 125I-insulin were evaluated. 125I-insulin binding to intact peripheral monocytes and erythrocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts, and cultured Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes, as well as to partially purified receptor preparations from these cells, was entirely normal. In contrast, the insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of the partially purified monocyte, erythrocyte, and fibroblast receptor preparations were markedly diminished. Solubilized, lectin-purified receptors from virally transformed cultured lymphocytes, however, demonstrated normal insulin-sensitive kinase activity. The patient's peripheral monocytes did not internalize 125I-insulin at 37 degrees C, but her transformed lymphocytes internalized it normally, as assessed by electron microscopic autoradiography. Our findings suggest that the discordance between the functions of the alpha-subunits and beta-subunits of the insulin receptor from monocytes of this insulin-resistant patient (Science 1984;223:932-4) extends to other freshly isolated cell types and persists in her cultured cells. Viral transformation of her cells results directly or indirectly in normal expression of the receptor kinase activity. Whether the defective kinase activity of the insulin receptor and the impaired receptor internalization exhibited by her monocytes ultimately cause the patient's insulin resistance awaits further studies.\r"

  ".W": "Infective endocarditis usually occurs in patients who have had previous cardiac damage or who have congenitally abnormal hearts. However, this infection may afflict otherwise normal individuals, and it is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In these individuals, interactions between circulating microorganisms and resident cardiac endothelial cells may initiate the infection. In the present studies we established an assay to measure in vitro binding of S. aureus to porcine cardiac valve endothelial cells. We found that this interaction was specific and saturable with respect to time. In contrast, there was no specific binding of Escherichia coli, an organism that rarely causes endocarditis. Exogenous fibronectin had no effect on specific binding of S. aureus, and heat-killed organisms adhered equally well as viable bacteria. Fixation of the endothelial cells with formalin abolished all specific binding. Soluble components from bacterial extracts inhibited S. aureus binding in dose-dependent fashion. These observations suggest that circulating S. aureus may interact with specific sites on cardiac endothelial cells, thereby potentially initiating infective endocarditis.\r"

  ".U": "88274207\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that insulin resistance in type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by a decrease in the rate as well as the amplitude of response to insulin, seven patients with diabetes mellitus and 12 subjects without diabetes were given an identical amount of insulin on two occasions: once as a primed constant and once as a variable eight-step infusion. On both occasions plasma glucose concentrations were maintained in the euglycemic range by means of an exogenous glucose infusion. The amplitude of stimulation of glucose utilization was decreased (p less than 0.05) in the type I patients compared with the subjects without diabetes during both a constant and a variable insulin infusion, whether measured as the peak (2.24 +/- 0.11 mg/kg/min vs 3.18; +/- 0.18 mg/kg/min constant and 2.80 +/- 0.30 mg/kg/min vs 3.54 +/- 0.23 mg/kg/min variable) or integrated response above basal (54 +/- 2 mg/kg vs 115 +/- 26 mg/kg constant and 60 +/- 26 mg/kg vs 147 +/- 21 mg/kg, variable). In addition, the rate of activation of glucose utilization (slope 0 to 90 minutes) was decreased (p less than 0.02) in the type I patients compared with subjects without diabetes during both the constant (0.003 +/- 0.001 mg/kg/min 2 vs 0.008 +/- 0.002 mg/kg/min 2) and variable (0.006 +/- 0.002 mg/kg/min 2 vs 0.015 +/- 0.002 mg/kg/min 2) insulin infusions. Insulin antibody binding did not correlate with the severity of insulin resistance. We conclude that insulin resistance in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is attributable to a decrease in both the rate and amplitude of response to insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-one adult patients with advanced T-cell lymphoma/leukemia including 54 with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), who were treated between 1981 and 1983 with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and doxorubicin (VEPA) or VEPA plus methotrexate (VEPA-M) in randomized fashion, were evaluated for pretreatment characteristics. The overall complete response (CR) and the 4-year survival rates were 39.5% and 19.4%, respectively, and 69% of 32 CR patients had relapses, indicating the need for development of new effective regimens for the disease. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, only three factors, leukemic manifestation, poor performance status (PS), and a high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, were significantly associated with the poor response rate. In a Cox proportional hazards model analysis, shortened survival was again significantly associated with poor PS and a high LDH level, but not with a clinical diagnosis of ATL. The two factors, PS and LDH level, that were found to be significantly associated with both CR and survival rates, were used to construct a model containing six categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival. These categories divided the patients into three groups with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 75% and 53% for low-risk, 45% and 15% for moderate-risk, and 15% and 0% for high-risk. The results indicate that PS and LDH levels were the most important in predicting the response and survival of an adult patient with advanced T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. The prognosis of patients with usual peripheral T-cell lymphoma, excluding ATL, was comparable with that of advanced B-cell lymphoma. These results have important implications for the design of new prospective therapeutic trials.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-eight patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive megestrol acetate 40 mg orally four times daily or tamoxifen 10 mg orally twice a day. Upon treatment failure patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Eligibility required that either the estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) be positive or that both values be unknown, and that the patients be at least 2 years post-spontaneous menopause or over 50 years of age. Pretreatment characteristics including performance status (PS), disease-free interval (DFI), receptor status, and prior treatment were similar for both groups. Only three patients had previous hormonal therapy while one third had prior chemotherapy. Objective response was determined using strict International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria. Seventeen of 61 patients achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on megestrol (28%) while 20 of 64 patients achieved CR or PR on tamoxifen (31%). Responses of skin and bone lesions were similar for both agents; however, more patients with visceral disease responded to tamoxifen. Response did not correlate with the level of ER or PR but was correlated with age. Both unadjusted and adjusted analysis of time to progression and adjusted analysis (for pretreatment variables) of survival showed significant differences favoring tamoxifen. Six of 44 patients (14%) crossed from megestrol to tamoxifen achieved CR or PR while only two of 38 patients (5%) crossed from tamoxifen to megestrol achieved response. Only one of the original patients randomized to megestrol remains on study, while 12 patients still remain on tamoxifen. These data indicate similar response rates for megestrol and tamoxifen; however, time to progression and overall survival significantly favor tamoxifen when used as first-line therapy in this trial.\r"

Premenopausal patients were randomized to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF), cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, and prednisone (CMFP), or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, prednisone, and tamoxifen (CMFPT). Postmenopausal patients were randomized to observation, CMFP, or CMFPT. Median follow-up time was 4.5 years. At 3 years, 225 patients relapsed and in 70 (31% of failures, 11% of all patients) the initial site was LR without distant metastases. In a multivariate analysis, the risk of an isolated LR recurrence significantly correlated with the number of positive axillary nodes, the primary tumor size, the presence of tumor necrosis, and the number of axillary nodes examined. Factors that significantly discriminated between an isolated LR recurrence and distant metastasis were the number of positive nodes and primary tumor size. Patients with four to seven positive nodes or tumor size greater than or equal to 5 cm had a chance of developing an isolated LR recurrence almost equal to the risk of distant metastases. These findings suggest a potential for improved survival in this subset of patients with the addition of postmastectomy radiation to chemotherapy, and continue to emphasize the presence of a group of patients at high risk for isolated LR recurrence despite adjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the value of early intensification of chemotherapy in 68 consecutive children with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) who were admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from November 1983 through March 1987. Fifty-eight patients (85%) entered complete remission after treatment with etoposide (VP-16)/cytarabine (ara-C) (A), followed by daunorubicin (Dauno)/ara-C/thioguanine (6-TG) (B) and then VP-16/azacytidine (5-AZ) (C). Thirty percent of the complete responders, mainly those with an M4 or M5 leukemia subtype, attained M1 marrow status after component A, 60% after A + B, and 10% after A + B + C. Induction failures resulted primarily from absolute or relative drug resistance; there was only one death during this phase of therapy. Postremission treatment consisted of three pairs of drugs (vincristine [VCR]/amsacrine [m-AMSA], or doxorubicin [Doxo]/6-TG/ara-C, and VP-16/cyclophosphamide [CTX]) administered sequentially in 6-week cycles for 22 months. Despite the high rate of remission induction, only 33% +/- 7% SE of the patients are expected to be failure-free survivors at 2 years. Remission durations were not significantly affected by the majority of factors examined in this study, with the exception of marrow cellularity after VP-16/ara-C induction therapy. Patients with less than or equal to 5% leukemic cells survived relapse-free for a median of 36.1 months, compared with 11.3 months for the group with a larger infiltrate (P = .01). Although postremission therapy did not improve the percentage of long-term failure-free survivors, the induction regimen we used appears highly effective, and its components should be considered for inclusion in other treatment programs.\r"

All patients were entered on a treatment protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1978 to 1986. The 11 patients all had favorable histology Wilms' tumor. Staging and therapy were based on interpretation of the CXR and abdominal findings. Excluding CT findings, one patient had stage I disease, two stage II, seven stage III, and one stage IV on the basis of multiple liver metastases. Four patients have relapsed: one with stage II and three with stage III. All relapses have been pulmonary. Overall, 4/11 (36%) relapsed. This relapse rate is considerably greater than the 20% overall relapse rate of patients treated according to this protocol though not statistically significant. These relapses suggest that such patients may be at increased risk for pulmonary recurrence. The results also indicate that small lesions initially noted only on CT scans of the chest in children with Wilms' tumor frequently represent metastatic tumor. Further studies of larger numbers of patients will be necessary to confirm these findings.\r"

  ".W": "Progress in the treatment of advanced squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the head and neck (H & N) has included the development of combination chemotherapeutic regimens that achieve impressive complete response (CR) rates using two to three courses therapy with minimal toxicity and good patient tolerance. Further improvements in these results will require intensification of induction regimens. Therefore, a five course, alternating combination chemotherapy induction trial was initiated in an attempt to test the feasibility and toxicity of a prolonged, intensive induction regimen in patients with advanced SCC of H & N. Courses 1, 3, and 5 consisted of fluorouracil as a 120-hour infusion (5FU-I) with cisplatin (CACP) as an intravenous (IV) bolus. Courses 2 and 4 consisted of 3 weekly doses of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) followed by 5FU (5FU-b) and leucovorin rescue (LR). Forty-six stage IV patients with SCC of H & N (85% T4 and 58% N3) were entered. Thirty-one patients completed the study and 15 did not. Twenty-one of the 46 patients (46%) achieved a CR. Twenty-five of the 46 patients had N3 neck disease, ten of these 25 achieved a CR (40%), and eight did not complete therapy. Of the 15 patients not completing this study, one patient achieved a CR and eight achieved a partial response (PR). Eight of 46 (17%) were removed from study for reasons of toxicity (6% to 13%) or tumor progression (2% to 4%). The remaining seven were removed due to intercurrent medical conditions (four uncomplicated pneumonias and one gun shot wound) or lost to follow-up (2). Myelosuppression, mucositis, and skin toxicity increased in frequency by the end of the trial but were acceptable and reversible. The activity of this five-course regimen is promising given the advanced disease status of patients treated. Consideration of concurrent medical conditions, patient compliance, intensity of medical, nutritional and social support, and levels of acceptable toxicity will be necessary in the design of future, intensive induction trials.\r"

  ".U": "88274494\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred fifty-three patients with advanced germ cell malignancy received initial chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin followed by surgical resection of residual masses if possible. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) were prospectively randomized to receive 6 months maintenance therapy with vinblastine or no further treatment. CR was achieved in 183 patients (72%) and a further eight patients (4%) had complete resection of residual viable malignancy (no evidence of disease [NED]). Pretreatment factors having a significant adverse influence on response by univariate analysis included extragonadal origin of the tumor, poor performance status, advanced lung or lung and abdominal disease, and elevated serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) greater than 1,000 ng/mL. Multivariate regression analysis indicated the independent prognostic factors of significance were advanced lung or advanced lung and abdominal disease, total tumor diameter greater than 10 cm, and a serum level of HCG greater than 1,000 ng/mL. Of the toxicities encountered, myelosuppression was significant, being exacerbated by radiotherapy, and seven deaths occurred from septicemia. Bleomycin pulmonary toxicity occurred in 46% of patients and was severe in 4%, resulting in eight deaths. With a median follow-up of 64 months, relapses have occurred in 25 patients with no significant difference between those patients receiving or not receiving maintenance vinblastine. Eight of these relapses occurred beyond 1 year and four beyond 2 years of follow-up. Presently, 68% of the total patient population is alive and disease-free, with 84% of the CR and NED patients alive and 81% alive and disease-free. It is concluded that with prolonged follow-up, vinblastine maintenance therapy does not improve treatment outcome. Moreover, late relapses occur, cautioning against premature pronouncements of cure.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of adding the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide (VP-16-213) to a standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer was evaluated during a randomized trial. Chemotherapy consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) alone or with etoposide (EVAC). Of 139 patients enrolled, 136 patients were eligible for study and all but five were evaluable for response. The overall objective response was 46% in the VAC group v 70% in the etoposide-treated group (P = .008) with complete response (CR) rates of 12% v 29%, respectively (P = .030). Although the time to the observation of disease progression was significantly longer in the group of patients receiving etoposide (9.6 v 6.5 months, P = .010), overall survival was similar; this was probably due to administration of other agents including etoposide at the time of VAC failure. However, there were noteworthy differences in long-term (greater than or equal to 2 year) survival. Whereas only four (6%) patients treated with VAC lived 2 years, 11 (16%) of the etoposide-treated group did so (P = .100). Two-year failure-free survival was attained in one (2%) of the VAC patients and eight (11%) of the patients treated with etoposide (P = .034). Long-term survivorship, heretofore usually reported in patients with limited stage disease after a variety of treatments, may be possible with this drug combination in the setting of extensive disease.\r"

The ECM functions as a biological adhesive that maintains the normal cytoarchitecture of different tissues and defines the key spatial relationships among dissimilar cell types. A loss of coordination and an alteration in the interactions between mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells separated by an ECM are thought to be fundamental steps in the development and progression of cancer. Although a substantial body of knowledge has been accumulated concerning the role of the ECM in most other tissues, much less is known of the structure and function of the ECM in the nervous system. Recent experiments in mammalian systems have shown that an increased knowledge of the ECM in the nervous system can lead to a better understanding of complex neurobiological processes under developmental, normal, and pathological conditions. This review focuses on the structure and function of the ECM in the peripheral and central nervous systems and on the importance of ECM macromolecules in axonal regeneration, cerebral edema, and cerebral neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy exists regarding the optimal treatment for patients with multiple brain abscesses. These lesions are often small and located deep in the brain and close to vital structures, making surgery difficult. With this in mind the authors review their experience in treating multiple abscesses using computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotaxic aspiration. From 1983 to 1985, 15 patients were treated for multiple brain abscesses, of whom eight underwent stereotaxic aspiration. There were a total of 28 abscesses in these eight patients: 11 abscesses were aspirated and two excised using CT-guided techniques. Most were cortical in location, although there were 12 in the deep white matter, one in the thalamus, and two in the caudate nucleus. All patients received a total of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Follow-up CT showed resolution of the abscesses in all patients. Currently, four are neurologically normal, one has a mild hemiparesis, one has a well-controlled seizure disorder, and one requires supportive care. A single death occurred 5 weeks postoperatively of unrelated causes. Location, size, and age of an abscess all have bearing upon the response to management and outcome of the patient. Stereotaxic surgery is a procedure with minimal morbidity and mortality. Stereotaxic aspiration should be considered in patients with small, multiple, or deep-seated abscesses, in those who are poor operative candidates, and in those who have failed prior therapy.\r"

The present authors first reported their technique of split-skull cranioplasty in 1983, and describe here their experience with this procedure in the management of extensive and difficult cranial defects. Twenty-nine patients (11 females and 18 males) are reviewed. Ten patients had histories of infection before reconstruction surgery. Eleven patients received radiation therapy at the grafted areas. The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 4 1/2 years. There was no evidence of bone resorption during that time, and minor complications occurred in only two of the patients. This procedure offered several advantages: 1) the bone graft, an autogenous material, can be used in previously infected areas; 2) the reconstruction contour is smooth and natural; 3) there was no morbidity or scarring at the donor site; 4) surgery time is much shorter than with split-rib cranioplasty. The primary disadvantage of split-skull cranioplasty is the decreased thickness of the skull at the donor site.\r"

No antimicrobial agents were given to two similar groups of patients: 172 with supratentorial craniotomy and 19 with suboccipital craniotomy. The infection rate in the vancomycin groups was significantly lower (p less than 0.013), and bone-flap infections alone, the most common infection after supratentorial craniotomy, were significantly fewer (p less than 0.042). Antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended only for selected high-risk groups. Since a bone flap is devascularized, its resistance to infection is reduced and, once infected, it usually requires surgical removal. Patients undergoing craniotomy with a bone flap therefore form a high-risk group, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is justified.\r"

Stereotaxic implantation is being used to inject cytotoxic lymphocytes into gliomas and to replace dopaminergic cells in parkinsonian models. Systematic assessment of the factors that influence success in implantation of cell suspensions into solid tissues is needed. A model was developed for investigation of stereotaxic implantation using radiolabeled rat lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Anesthetized rats received microliter injections of cell suspension into the right caudate nucleus. The injection volume, cell concentration, infusion rate, and needle size were varied systematically. The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after injection; the brain was removed and sectioned, and the radioactivity was counted. Three aliquots of the suspension were injected into counting tubes for control analysis. Recovery of radioactivity was expressed as the percent of mean counts per minute (cpm) in the right frontal lobe/mean cpm in the three control tubes. To assess the viability of implanted cells, the right frontal region was mechanically dissociated in media and centrifuged, and the pellet and supernatant were counted. By using small needles and slow infusion of volumes of 10 microliters or less, 85% to 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in the caudate nucleus. At least half of the implanted cells were viable. Consistent, accurate implantation of dispersed cells into brain over a range of volumes, cell concentrations, infusion rates, and needle sizes was achieved.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting canine heterotopic cardiac allograft rejection scintigraphically after administration of 111In lymphocytes. To determine whether the approach is capable of detecting rejection in orthotopic cardiac transplants in which labeled lymphocytes circulating in the blood pool may reduce sensitivity, the present study was performed in which canine orthotopic cardiac transplants were evaluated in vivo. Immunosuppression was maintained with cyclosporine A (10-20 mg/kg/day) and prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for 2 wk after transplantation. Subsequently, therapy was tapered. Five successful allografts were evaluated scintigraphically every 3 days after administration of 100-350 microCi 111In autologous lymphocytes. Correction for labeled lymphocytes circulating in the blood pool, but not actively sequestered in the allografts was accomplished by administering 3-6 mCi 99mTc autologous erythrocytes and employing a previously validated blood-pool activity correction technique. Cardiac infiltration of labeled lymphocytes was quantified as percent indium excess (%IE), scintigraphically detectable 111In in the transplant compared with that in blood, and results were compared with those of concomitantly performed endomyocardial biopsy. Scintigraphic %IE for hearts not undergoing rejection manifest histologically was 0.7 +/- 0.4. Percent IE for rejecting hearts was 6.8 +/- 4.0 (p less than 0.05). Scintigraphy detected each episode of rejection detected by biopsy. Scintigraphic criteria for rejection (%IE greater than 2 s.d. above normal) were not manifest in any study in which biopsies did not show rejection. Since scintigraphic results with 111In-labeled lymphocytes were concordant with biopsy results in orthotopic cardiac transplants, noninvasive detection of graft rejection in patients should be attainable with the approach developed.\r"

In rats that were tube-fed, levels of adiposity were greater but sera from these rats decreased stromal-vascular and preadipocyte proliferation in culture when compared with sera from ad libitum-fed rats. Sera from tube-fed animals promoted an increase in preadipocyte differentiation as revealed by esterase staining. Results indicate that overfeeding in juvenile rats causes sera changes that support fat cell differentiation but not fat cell hyperplasia.\r"

  ".U": "88274568\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we have found that porcine kidney fibroblasts will grow in medium containing D-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (D-methionine hydroxy analogue, D-MHA) as the sole source of methionine but not in medium containing the L-isomer (L-MHA) alone. The fibroblasts have been found to have both D-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.6), which uses D-MHA as substrate (Km = 6.0 mM) and L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase (EC 1.1.3.1), which uses L-MHA as substrate (Km = 7.1 mM). These two activities should make it possible for the fibroblasts to grow on either isomer. Only one protein band with L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity can be detected with enzyme-specific staining of protein profiles obtained after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase from porcine kidney has properties that are different from the two porcine isozymes reported previously by others. Passage of DL-[14C]MHA at tracer levels into the porcine kidney fibroblasts in culture is reduced to 31% of control in the presence of 3.75 mM D-MHA, 86% of control with 3.75 mM L-MHA and 65% with 3.75 mM D-lactate but is not affected by up to 3.75 mM L-lactate. It appears that the transport specificity is the basis for the growth promotion of kidney fibroblasts by the D-isomer of MHA as opposed to L-MHA when each is used as the sole source of methionine.\r"

The bone grafts were obtained from below the mandibular incisors and canines through an intraoral approach. The marginal bone level achieved was satisfactory in all cases evaluated by occlusal radiographs; the radiographs also demonstrated that the bone grafts were totally integrated after 6 months in all cases. The morphology of the reconstructed alveolar process was satisfactory in all cases evaluated and no periodontal complications were seen. The donor site appeared healed radiologically in all cases 6 months after surgery. The advantages gained by using a mandibular bone graft as compared to an iliac crest graft include reduced morbidity, reduced hospitalization time, reduced operating time, and avoidance of scarring at the donor site. The results of the present study demonstrate that the mandibular symphysis can be used as donor site for reconstruction of small alveolar clefts.\r"

The evidence has been contradictory and is more supportive of some degree of immunosuppression only when one considers in vitro studies. These have been seriously flawed by the very high concentrations of drug used to produce immunosuppression and by the lack of comparisons with other membrane-active drugs. The closer that experimental studies have been to actual clinical situations, the less compelling has been the evidence. Although the topic was of great interest during the 1970's, as indicated by the preponderance of the references from that period, interest has waned during the present decade. This waning of interest suggests that perhaps most investigators feel that this line of inquiry will not be rewarding. The AIDS epidemic has also diverted the attention of immunologists to the far more serious problem of the truly devastating effects a retrovirus can have on a portion of the immune system. The relationship between the use of social drugs and the development of clinical manifestations of AIDS has been of some interest, however. Persons infected with the virus but not diagnosed as AIDS have been told to avoid the use of marijuana and/or alcohol. This advice may be reasonable as a general health measure, but direct evidence that heeding this warning will prevent the ultimate damage to the immune system is totally lacking.\r"

There is much published evidence about the availability of highly potent varieties of cannabis from the nineteenth century through the present day. The effects attributed to the new marijuana are the same ones debated for centuries in many different cultures. The assertion that \"all marijuana research to date has been done on 1 or 2 percent THC material\" (Cohen 1968) ignores several thousand years of human experience with the drug. The old medical cannabis extracts were stronger than most of the forms now available, though the potency of illicit hash oils by the mid-1970's was approaching the level of medicinal preparations available before their removal from the USP. While it may be true that sinsemilla is more widely available than 10 or 15 years ago, its potency has not changed significantly from the 2.4 to 9.5 percent THC materials available in 1973-1974 (see Table I), or the five to 14 percent sinsemilla of 1975 (Perry 1977). The range of potencies available then (marijuana at 0.1% to 7.8% THC, averaging 2.0% to 5.0% THC by 1975) was approximately the same as that reported now. With such a range, the evidence simply cannot support the argument by Cohen (1986) that marijuana is \"ten or more times more potent than the product smoked ten years ago.\" And to say that marijuana potency has increased 1,400 percent since any date in history is patent nonsense.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two methods, dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) and quantitative computed tomography, have widespread application in adults but only limited use in children. One method, single-photon absorptiometry (SPA), has been used extensively in adults and children and has been modified for use in infants. The radius shaft has been used for most research on infants. However, the difficulty of using older SPA methods on this small bone (4 to 7 mm width) has led a few investigators to measure the shaft of the humerus. The typical precision of measurement in a newborn is about 5% with the use of computerized rectilinear scanners for the radius; older linear scanners have a precision error of 5% to 10% on the humerus. Linear scanners cannot measure precisely the radius in individual neonates. The SPA scans typically take about 5 minutes. The DPA technique using 153Gd has been modified for use on smaller animals (5 to 10 kg monkeys and dogs), but it has not been used on infants because DPA scans take 20 minutes. New methods using x-ray absorptiometry allow rapid (1 minute), precise (1%) measurements in the perinate. The need for a soft tissue bolus is eliminated, and both the axial and peripheral skeletons can be measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Ultrasonic measurements do not yet offer adequate precision in the neonate, given the limited biologic range of values.\r"

It also appears that expression of assessment results in terms of BMC and bone width (BW) permits an evaluation of growth of bone mass versus growth of size of the bone scanned. Although the BMC/BW ratio might be a useful but unproved conceptual adjunct, expression of photon absorptiometry results in terms of the BMC/BW ratio alone does not confer any specific advantage and theoretically could mask important specific information about bone mass and size.\r"

Studies of infants in which SPA was used include studies of fetal bone mineralization and postnatal bone mineralization in very low birth weight infants. The SPA technique has also been used as a research tool to investigate longitudinal bone mineralization and to study the effect of nutrition and disease processes such as rickets or osteopenia of prematurity. At present, it has little direct clinical application for diagnosing bone disease in single patients. The bones most often used to measure bone mineral content (BMC) are the radius, the ulna, and, less often, the humerus. The radius appears to be preferred as a suitable bone to measure BMC in infants. It is easily accessible; anatomic reference points are easily palpated and have a constant relationship to the radial mid-shaft site; soft tissue does not affect either palpation of anatomic reference points or BMC quantitation in vivo. The peripheral location of the radius minimizes body radiation exposure. Trabecular and cortical bone can be measured separately. Extensive background studies exist on radial BMC in small infants. Most important, the radius has a relatively long zone of constant BMC. Finally, SPA for BMC in the radius has a high degree of precision and accuracy.\r"

The bone mineral content/bone width ratio may be helpful in identifying disorders of bone mineral metabolism in premature infants. The technique has been used to demonstrate that relatively poor bone mineralization (compared with the intrauterine curve) occurs in very low birth weight infants after birth, regardless of the type of feeding or the presence or absence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

However, this action does not readily explain all the behavioral or metabolic effects of these drugs. In view of previous reports that phencyclidine interacts with potassium channels in a variety of excitable cells, the author investigated the ability of phencyclidine, ketamine and MK-801 to block voltage-gated potassium currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Under voltage clamp all three drugs reduced both early, transient potassium currents and steady-state potassium currents when neurons were stepped between -80 and -10 mV. In current clamp, phencyclidine and MK-801 diminished the action potential peak, its maximum rate of rise and its maximum rate of fall, suggesting that they antagonize sodium as well as potassium currents. Both phencyclidine and MK-801 produced a slowly developing blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate currents which was present at a holding potential of -50 mV. The selective potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate responses. These findings indicate that this group of drugs can interact with voltage-gated channels, in addition to N-methyl-D-aspartate gated channels. However, the high concentrations required to block voltage-gated channels suggests that these effects are not behaviorally relevant.\r"

In contrast, naloxone fails to increase serum LH in the prepubescent male rat but, coincident with the onset of puberty (30-35 days of age), the antagonist becomes increasingly more effective until adult appropriate responses are achieved at sexual maturation. The purpose of the present studies was to examine and characterize further the dichotomous response to naloxone and morphine in the prepubescent male rat. We found that the inability of naloxone to affect a release in LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) was not related to pharmacokinetic factors as the dose and time-response characteristics were identical in young and adult animals. In addition, our results indicated that the release of LHRH and its actions on the pituitary to promote LH release were equivalent in prepubescent and adult rats, indicating that if naloxone was capable of releasing LHRH then robust increases in LH should have occurred. Our results indicate further that the ineffectiveness of naloxone in prepubescent animals was not unique to this compound inasmuch as kappa antagonists also were devoid of activity in young animals but were highly effective in adults; delta opiate antagonists failed to increase LH either in young or adult animals. In contrast to these data, we observed that mu and kappa agonists were equipotent in depressing serum LH levels in both young and adult animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SKF-525A (beta-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylpentanoate) (40 mg/kg i.p.) or water was administered 0.5 hr before the CPH treatment, and the animals were sacrificed 6 hr after the second dose of CPH. The pancreatic insulin concentration was determined, and the levels of CPH and its metabolites in pancreas, liver and lung were measured. It was found that SKF-525A pretreatment significantly protected rats from the insulin loss induced by CPH; SKF-525A alone had no effect on pancreatic insulin. The tissues from animals pretreated with SKF-525A, when compared with those of the control, had 10-fold higher levels of CPH, significantly lower concentrations of the metabolite desmethylcyproheptadine-10,11-epoxide (DMCPH-epoxide) and no change in the levels of desmethylcyproheptadine (DMCPH). The in vivo N-demethylation of N-[methyl-14C]CPH, as measured by the excretion rate of 14CO2, also was inhibited by SKF-525A pretreatment. Similar experiments were performed with another inhibitor of drug metabolism, 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-2,6-dimethyl-4-ethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (DDEP, 50 mg/kg i.p.); and the same results were obtained. In other experiments using DMCPH as the insulin-depleting compound, SKF-525A or DDEP pretreatment also afforded significant protection against chemical-induced insulin loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nor-BNI and U-50,488H were used to demonstrate that kappa opioid receptors in the spinal cord were more important than those located supraspinally for kappa-mediated analgesia. Nor-BNI also possessed high affinity and high selectivity for kappa opioid receptors in the receptor binding assay.

  ".W": "The effects of neurokinins (NKs), tachykinins and some NK-related peptides (selective agonists for the NK-1, NK-2 or NK-3 receptors) have been investigated in the various sections of the rat lower urinary tract. In the isolated bladder, all peptides were substantially equipotent with the exception of senktide, an NK-3 agonist, which was distinctly less potent than the other compounds. Similar results were obtained in the isolated urethra. In these tissues, the maximal response to NK-1 agonists was distinctly less intense than that to the other peptides. In the bladder, exposure to phenoxybenzamine (30 microM for 90 min) reduced the response to NK-A but not that to substance P, KCl or field stimulation. In the isolated ureter, peptides active at both the NK-2 and the NK-3 sites [including senktide and [MePhe7]-NKB(4-10)] activated, at nanomolar concentrations a series of rhythmic contractions, whereas peptides active at the NK-1 site, were active only at micromolar concentrations. These findings provide further evidence that multiple NK receptors are present in the rat lower urinary tract. In the bladder, NK-2 and NK-1 sites mediate the direct response to NKs, in accordance with binding and autoradiographic data. In the ureter, both NK-2 and NK-3 sites may activate the direct contractile response to these substances.\r"

  ".W": "In the small intestine of urethane-anesthetized rats, i.v. neurokinins (NKs) (0.043-14 nmol/kg) produce three distinct motor effects, e.g.: 1) a transient relaxation followed by 2) a phasic contraction and 3) a tonic contraction. The aim of this study was to characterize the nature of the receptor determining the transient relaxation and mechanisms involved. The transient relaxation was more evident in the distal than in the proximal duodenum or in the jejunum. The rank order of potency of NKs in producing relaxation was NKA greater than substance P greater than NKB. The heptapeptide NKA(4-10) was as potent as the decapeptide NKA in determining relaxation but less potent than NKA in producing phasic or tonic contraction. NKA (0.43 nmol/kg i.v.)-induced relaxation and tonic contraction were unaffected by [D-Pro2, D-Trp7.g]substance P, a compound which, in this tissue, acts as a NK-1 receptor antagonist. NKA (0.43 nmol/kg i.v.)-induced relaxation of the distal duodenum was unaffected by atropine, hexamethonium or adrenalectomy, reduced by phentolamine plus propranolol and abolished by guanethidine or acute (15 min before) removal of the celiac ganglion complex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of a NK-2 receptor located on postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the prevertebral ganglia produces the intestinal relaxation in response to i.v. NKs.\r"

The presence of nicotinic receptor sites in neuronal cultures was indicated by the specific binding of L-[3H]nicotine to cell membrane preparations. No binding was observed with membrane preparations derived from glial cell cultures. Binding to neuronal membranes was saturable, reversible and stereoselective. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity sites with a Kd of 3 nM and an average maximum number of binding sites of 25 fmol/mg of protein. The affinity of the sites was the same as that in adult cortical tissue, but the maximum number of sites was 25% of adult levels. The time course of binding exhibited complex kinetics that were consistent with the conversion of the sites to a high affinity state. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant calculated from the kinetic rate constants for association (0.014 min-1 nM-1) and dissociation (0.03 min-1) was 2 nM, in good agreement with the results of equilibrium binding studies. In general, the pharmacological specificity of the sites, as judged from inhibition binding studies, was similar to that in adult brain. Nicotinic agonists were the most potent competitive inhibitors of [3H]nicotine binding and antagonists were the least effective. The D-isomer of nicotine was about 30-fold less potent than the L-isomer. The results show that cortical neurons contain high affinity nicotinic binding sites and that the properties of these sites are similar to those attributed to putative nicotinic cholinergic receptors in adult rat brain tissue.\r"

The concentration-response curve to NMDA was shifted to the right by CGS 19755 (pA2 = 5.94), suggesting a competitive interaction with NMDA-type receptors. CGS 19755 inhibited the binding of [3H]-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid to NMDA-type receptors with an IC50 of 50 nM, making it the most potent NMDA-type receptor antagonist reported to date. CGS 19755 failed to interact with 23 other receptor types as assessed by receptor binding, including the quisqualate- and kainate-type excitatory amino acid receptors. In crude P2 fractions, no evidence was obtained to suggest that CGS 19755 is taken up by an active transport system. Furthermore, CGS 19755 failed to affect the uptake of L-[3H]glutamate, or to interact with aconitine-induced inhibition of L-[3H]glutamate uptake, the latter finding suggesting a lack of membrane-stabilizing or local anesthetic properties. CGS 19755 selectively antagonized the excitatory effect of iontophoretically applied NMDA in the red nucleus of the rat without affecting the excitatory effects of quisqualate. CGS 19755 blocked the harmaline-induced increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP levels at a dose of 4 mg/kg i.p. with a duration of action exceeding 2 hr. CGS 19755 inhibited convulsions elicited by maximal electroshock in rat (ED50 = 3.8 mg/kg i.p. 1 hr after administration) and in mouse (ED50 = 2.0 mg/kg i.p. 0.5 hr after administration). Likewise, convulsions elicited by picrotoxin were inhibited by CGS 19755, whereas the compound was relatively weak in protecting against convulsions elicited by pentylenetetrazole or strychnine. CGS 19755 produced retention performance deficits in a dark avoidance task.

It is argued that certain breast cancer and hormone factors may contribute little to the explanation of such international variations in incidence of this neoplasm. It is further argued that experimental studies in animals support a specific role for dietary fat in the promotion of mammary tumors, but the effects of calories alone seem to be largely restricted to tumor initiation. Finally, data from international, migrant-population, and analytic epidemiologic investigations are used to motivate the basic relative risk assumption of study designs thus far proposed for the Women's Health Trial, and some continuing motivations for a dietary intervention (low-fat diet) trial are discussed.\r"

Major effects consistently produced by REST include (a) superlearning, (b) optimal physiological and psychological functioning, and (c) diminished denial and defensiveness. Persons showing greatest impairment or psychological disturbance prior to REST typically show the greatest \"improvement\" or change toward optimal levels of functioning afterward. REST facilitates natural homeostatic processes. Despite three decades of overwhelmingly positive research findings, REST technology has thus far received little understanding or acceptance. Common misconceptions about REST (formerly known as \"sensory deprivation\") are critically assessed and shown to be unfounded.\r"

  ".W": "Fish oil supplements are currently being nationally advertised, and many physicians are being queried about their clinical utility. Epidemiologic studies reveal a low incidence of cardiovascular disease in people, such as the Eskimos, who eat large amounts of seafood. Cardiovascular health may be improved because fish and fish oil supplements lower plasma lipid levels (especially triglycerides), inhibit platelet aggregation, and may decrease blood pressure and viscosity and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Preliminary observations also suggest a potential future role for fish oils in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with serum triglyceride levels greater than 5.64 mmol/L and/or cholesterol levels greater than 7.75 mmol/L refractory to dietary management may benefit from a medically supervised trial of fish oil supplements. Data currently available are insufficient to recommend fish oil supplements for the general public, or for patients with other diseases, and side effects must also be considered. These include occasional adverse lipid changes, potential for bleeding and vitamin E deficiency, and, with some preparations, vitamin A and D toxicity.\r"

The emergence of multi-institutional organizations, the rise of investor-owned health care corporations, and the expansion of group medical practice illustrate the increasing organizational influence in medicine. Added to these trends are new financial incentives confronting both physicians and organizations so that the environment increasingly favors conflict. This article reviews the primary strategies for resolving physician-organization conflicts, including cooperation between physicians and organizations, having physician representatives in governance and management, restructuring incentives, and restructuring organizations. Although these strategies have various merits, we suggest that every physician has a personal responsibility to become more involved in organization and management issues. Physicians can play an important role in guiding the evolution of medicine.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effects of artificial beta-cell-directed insulin therapy on protein metabolism in patients with diabetes mellitus, nitrogen balance, urea production, and whole body protein turnover were determined in five type I insulin-dependent subjects and five age- and sex-matched controls. Each diabetic participant was studied over two 4-day periods while receiving conventional insulin therapy (one or two daily injections of short and intermediate acting insulin) or insulin delivered by the artificial beta-cell. While the diabetic participants received conventional insulin therapy, nitrogen balance, urea production, whole body protein turnover, and protein synthesis and breakdown rates did not differ significantly from the control group. However, when the same subjects were on artificial beta-cell-directed insulin therapy, they manifested a significant net positive nitrogen balance of over 2 g/day. This change in nitrogen balance was largely due to a fall in urea nitrogen production from 174 +/- 6 to 140 +/- 13 mg/kg body weight per day (p less than 0.05). In addition, while artificial beta-cell therapy did not affect whole body protein turnover or breakdown rates, a significant rise (2.1 +/- 0.2 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 g/kg per day) in whole body protein synthesis was observed (p less than 0.05). Thus when compared to conventional insulin treatment, artificial beta-cell-directed insulin therapy was associated with a 14% increase in the rate of protein synthesis and a decrease of 20% in urea nitrogen production, leading to a net positive nitrogen balance.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer cachexia describes a syndrome of progressive weight loss, anorexia, and persistent erosion of host body cell mass in response to a malignant growth. Although often associated with preterminal patients bearing disseminated disease, cachexia may be present in the early stages of tumor growth before any signs or symptoms of malignancy. A decline in food intake relative to energy expenditure (which may be increased, normal, or decreased) is the fundamental physiologic derangement leading to cancer-associated weight loss. In addition, abnormalities of host carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism lead to continued mobilization and ineffective repletion of host tissue, despite adequate nutritional support. Mediators of cancer anorexia and associated abnormalities are unknown. Cachectin/TNF or other host-derived cytokines (produced as a defense against malignancy) have been implicated as signal molecules in cachexia, based upon similar metabolic derangements produced by these cytokines in other chronic wasting illnesses. Nutritional support is effective in maintaining body weight of cachectic cancer patients, but ineffective in maintaining lean body mass. Although in one study parenteral nutritional support has improved operative morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, it has not yet improved response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Because of metabolic derangements seen in cancer cachexia, effective nutritional treatment regimens will probably require manipulation of host intermediary metabolism in addition to feeding. Insulin therapy or exercise are two such methods which appear to preserve host composition by preferential feeding of the host at the expense of the tumor. Future studies which more clearly define the role of signal molecules in producing cancer cachexia syndrome may lead to new treatment strategies, possibly involving modulation of the effects of such molecules on host metabolism.\r"

The pathogenesis, diagnosis and histological features of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia are discussed.\r"

Obviously I have been unable to include all the important and well-done studies of various conditions, which together cover the entire spectrum of pediatric renal disease. It is evident from the many studies that the renal biopsy has been, is, and will be quite helpful in elucidating the histologic pattern and severity of injury in the child with clinical evidence of renal disease. As therapy becomes more effective for renal diseases known to cause progressive renal insufficiency, the impact of the renal biopsy will become even greater. Because of the frequent discordance between clinical laboratory findings and renal histologic severity, an initial or baseline biopsy is often the only way to stage the alterations in renal structure. Present tests of renal function are imperfect and are insensitive parameters of insidious and progressive renal disease. The capacity of the kidney to compensate for nephron loss by hypertrophy and modification of the remaining nephrons can mask progressive renal disease and thus impair our ability to detect meaningful differences in therapeutic results. A repeated biopsy or \"second look\" allows detailed comparison and study of the effects of various therapeutic regimens on the renal disease process. Continued, detailed clinical-morphologic correlations and studies using improved techniques hopefully will provide us with better profiles or predictors of the type, severity, and pathogenesis of the renal disease in the individual patient. Determination of the histologic pattern by renal biopsy at present remains one of the, if not the, most important and reliable prognostic indicators in the individual patient and allows us a unique look at the host response to the varying types of injuries leading to pediatric renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, both the developing atherosclerotic and FSGS lesions seem to share certain postulated pathophysiologic mechanisms, including endothelial cell injury, macrophage infiltration, hyperlipoproteinemia, and hypertension. As depicted in Figure 1, any initial glomerular injury results in flux of macromolecular substances into the glomerular mesangium. As an adjunct to increased glomerular barrier dysfunction, hyperlipoproteinemia is believed to secondarily develop from the dramatic losses of albumin, stimulating increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and the loss of lipoprotein lipase-activating substance into the urine which would effectively produce a reduction in circulating chylomicra and triglyceride catabolism. Certain elevated circulating lipoproteins could, theoretically, pass through the damaged glomerular filter into the mesangium, thereby enhancing the flux of macromolecules. Also associated with certain experimental glomerular disorders is the development of glomerular hypertension, as manifested by an elevated glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC), which can further augment macromolecular flux into the mesangium. Overloading of the glomerular mesangium by the above mechanisms is believed to be an injurious stimulus for MC to both proliferate and produce excess mesangial matrix substance. Both of these events are thought to be pathologic harbingers of glomerulosclerosis. Glomerular hypertension is also capable of damaging endothelial cells within the glomerular microcirculation, and this purportedly can activate platelets and result in glomerular thrombosis. At present, it is unclear how glomerular thrombosis produces increased mesangial cell injury; however, this process is believed to cause both systemic and glomerular hypertension which may serve as intermediary mechanisms producing the untoward effects of mesangial cell proliferation and matrix overproduction.\r"

Forty-eight hours after the i.v. injection of uranyl acetate (UA, 5 mg/kg), inulin clearance rate (Cin) decreased to approximately 43% of the control value in water drinking rats (P less than 0.005). Animals receiving continuous isotonic saline infusion following UA showed higher urine flow and Cin (60% of control, P less than 0.01), and lessened intratubular cast formation when compared with water-drinking ARF rats. A short-term saline infusion following UA did not attenuate the decline in Cin (43% of control). An inverse relationship was found between Cin and the number of casts (r = -0.75, P less than 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that standardized partial regression coefficient is statistically significant between Cin and cast formation (-0.69, P less than 0.05), but not between Cin and tubular necrosis (-0.07, P greater than 0.05). Renin depletion caused by DOCA plus saline drinking did not attenuate the decline in Cin in ARF (47% of control). No significant difference was found in urinary uranium excretion between water-drinking and saline-infused ARF rats. The findings suggest that continuous saline infusion following UA attenuates the decline in Cin in ARF rats; and that this beneficial effect of saline loading is associated with lessened cast formation rather than with suppressed renin-angiotensin activity or enhanced urinary-uranium excretion.\r"

The aim of this study was to find out whether or not this effect of CyA results from a direct interaction with renal juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, which are the site of renal renin synthesis and release. Using primary cell cultures from rat renal cortex containing more than 80% JG cells, we found that CyA (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml) stimulated renin secretion threefold. This stimulation was paralleled by a dose-dependent twofold increase of inactive renin within the cells, while the active intracellular renin remained the same. In order to identify a possible second messenger which could mediate the effects of CyA on JG cells, we examined the simultaneous effects of a single concentration of CyA (1 microgram/ml) on renin secretion, prostaglandin formation and intracellular cAMP concentration. However, prostaglandin formation and cAMP were not detectably altered by CyA in experiments where renin secretion was significantly enhanced. Our results indicate that cyclosporine A stimulates renin secretion and renin synthesis by a direct effect on renal juxtaglomerular cells. This action of CyA is not mediated by changes in cellular prostaglandin or intracellular cAMP.\r"

Its presence has been detected in 72% of different melanoma specimens but not in normal tissues. Because tumor antigens may stimulate or perhaps block immune reactions to cancer cells, their presence on the cell surface may be a critical factor influencing tumor growth. Therefore, to define further the immunobiological characteristics of melanoma TAA, this antigen was investigated by membrane immunofluorescence. Serum from a melanoma patient known to have a high anti-TAA antibody titer was absorbed quantitatively with lymphoblastoid cells autologous to the target melanoma cells to remove non-anti-TAA antibodies. The absorbed serum was reacted with three cultured melanoma cell lines, UCLA-SO-10 (M10), UCLA-SO-14(M), and UCLA-SO-24 (M24). Of these cell lines, M10 and M14 are known to express the antigen as assessed by radioimmunoassay. Reaction of the antibody(s) to the antigen(s) on the melanoma cell surface was detected by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. The reactivity of the absorbed serum was inhibited by preincubation with purified melanoma TAA. These results clearly demonstrate that melanoma TAA is expressed on the cell surface of cultured melanoma cells.\r"

The sample was subdivided into patients with predominantly elevated mood, predominantly depressed mood, and no consistent mood change. Pimozide reduced psychotic symptoms in all groups of patients. The only significant effect of lithium was to reduce elevated mood.

Among seropositive recipients CMV infection, especially symptomatic and disseminated infection, occurred significantly more frequently when kidneys came from seropositive than from seronegative donors. Since seropositive recipients can become infected with donor virus, the excess is probably accounted for by reinfection. This conclusion was supported by restriction enzyme typing of virus isolates from recipient pairs receiving kidneys from the same donor; proven reinfection with donor strain virus was significantly commoner than proven reactivation of recipient virus. Furthermore, symptoms occurred only in the proven reinfection group. Although the proportion of reinfections that caused symptoms was less than that seen in primary infections, prior natural infection with CMV clearly does not prevent symptomatic reinfection in seropositive recipients, a point which has profound implications for future vaccination strategies in renal allograft recipients and choice of donors.\r"

All treatments were given for 6 weeks and then withdrawn by 10 weeks. Ratings of psychopathology were made by psychiatric assessors blind to both treatment and diagnosis before treatment and at 2, 4, 6, and 10 weeks after randomisation. 18 patients had insufficient data for analysis because of early drop-out. There were no important differences in treatment response between the diagnostic groups, but diazepam was less effective than dothiepin, cognitive and behaviour therapy, or self-help, these three treatments being of similar efficacy. Significantly more patients in the placebo group took additional psychotropic drugs in the 10 week period, and those allocated to dothiepin and cognitive and behaviour therapy took the least.\r"

In the ASA group thromboxane formation, initially raised, fell rapidly and remained low. In the control group thromboxane formation decreased very slowly and was not normal by the end of the study period. Prostacyclin formation seemed identical in the two groups. Thus intermittent ASA, in this dosage, efficiently inhibited the enhanced thromboxane formation in acute myocardial infarction without interfering with prostacyclin formation.\r"

They were given a single dose of halofantrine hydrochloride, 16 mg/kg body weight. The recrudescence rate on day 14 of follow up was unacceptably high (38%). In the second trial the dose given was 8 mg/kg 6 hourly for three doses. Of the 49 children followed up for 14 days, 47 became aparasitaemic--ie, the cure rate was 96%. In both trials the drug was very well tolerated. Halofantrine hydrochloride seems to be effective against P falciparum chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains in Africa.\r"

In the first part the effect of approximately 28 mg frusemide given as an aerosol was compared with that of a placebo. In the second part two doses of inhaled frusemide (approximately 14 mg and 28 mg) were examined. In the third part the effect of 20 mg oral frusemide was tested. Inhaled frusemide had a good and dose-related protective effect, whereas oral frusemide was ineffective. The mean (95% CI) maximum percentage falls in the FEV1 were: 11.5 (14.3-8.7) with frusemide and 33.8 (39.1-28.5) with placebo in the first part of the study; 13.6 (21.6-6.0) with 28 mg frusemide, 19.7 (28.2-11.3) with 14 mg frusemide, and 34.6 (39.4-30.0) with placebo in the second part of the study; and 15.2 (19.9-10.5) with inhaled frusemide, 38.2 (47.1-29.3) with oral frusemide, and 35.3 (45.9-24.7) with placebo in the last part of the study. The findings lend support to the hyperosmolarity hypothesis of exercise-induced asthma and may have therapeutic implications.\r"

An antibody response to the immunodominant 47 kD antigen of Candida albicans is invariably associated with recovery. The presence of this antibody in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidosis and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) could account for the rarity of disseminated candidal infection in these conditions. Polyclonal B cell activation may be responsible for the frequency with which this antibody is produced in AIDS. Antibody to the 47 kD antigen could be useful in the treatment and prevention of systemic candidosis, though not in the superficial candidosis of AIDS.\r"

We identified 13 patients, over the past 17 years, who had both vasculitis and lympho- or myeloproliferative disorders and relate their clinical, laboratory, histologic, and immunologic features, course, therapy, and outcome. Nine patients were male, 4 female; ages ranged from 28 to 82 years. Ten of 13 patients presented with cutaneous vasculitis antedating malignancy by an average of 10 months. Three of 13 developed cutaneous vasculitis after malignancy. A statistically significant association between cutaneous vasculitis and lympho- or myeloproliferative malignancies was noted when compared with all other tumors. Dermatologic manifestations included palpable purpura (5 patients), maculopapular eruptions (4), urticarial and petechial lesions (3), and ulcers (1). Hepatitis B surface antigen, Coombs antibodies, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies were not found. Serum cryoglobulins were detected in 3 patients; serum C3 and C4 were normal in 8 of 9 patients evaluated. Histologic examinations revealed necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with disruption of endothelial integrity, destruction of endothelium, and neutrophil infiltration. Occasional perivascular mononuclear cell invasion was also noted in 4 patients. Immunofluorescent staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 was negative in all patients studied. Symptoms were, in general, poorly responsive to therapy, which included nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antihistamines, antiserotonin agents, and corticosteroids. Chemotherapy directed at the underlying malignancy was also generally ineffective, although the vasculitis appeared to lessen in severity. Vasculitis appeared to lessen in severity as bone marrow function deteriorated. Ten patients died, all as a direct result of their malignancy. We have described a unique clinical syndrome of lympho- and myeloproliferative disease presenting with small-vessel vasculitis. Recognition that rheumatic symptoms may reflect or antedate malignancy may permit early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and elucidation of pathogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88276044\r", 
  ".W": "It has been speculated that platelet activation may contribute to the evolution of vascular complications in patients with Type I diabetes mellitus. To address this hypothesis, we measured the plasma and urinary metabolites of thromboxane, presumably of platelet origin, and of prostacyclin, derived from endothelial cells, in addition to more conventional indexes of platelet function. Urinary excretion of the metabolites 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha did not differ between diabetics with or without retinopathy and nondiabetic controls. Furthermore, measurement of platelet granule constituents, the aggregation responses to ADP or arachidonic acid, and levels of serum thromboxane B2 failed to discriminate between the groups. The institution of tight diabetic control with multiple daily injections of insulin failed to alter either urinary metabolite excretion or plasma levels of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2. Conversely, insulin-induced hypoglycemia failed to alter the concentrations of plasma or urinary thromboxane metabolites in nondiabetic volunteers, despite a mean 60-fold increase in plasma epinephrine. These studies suggest that platelet activation does not precede the development of microvascular complications in patients with Type I diabetes who lack clinical evidence of macrovascular disease and have normal renal function. Furthermore, it is unlikely that platelet activation due to intermittent hypoglycemia contributes to the reportedly accelerated development of retinopathy in such patients, when they are subject to tight diabetic control.\r"

Both events are accompanied by ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Here we use chemical probes to investigate the possible interaction of these factors with ribosomal RNA in E. coli ribosomes. We observe EF-G-dependent footprints in vitro and in vivo around position 1,067 in domain II of 23S rRNA, and in the loop around position 2,660 in domain VI.EF-Tu gives an overlapping footprint in vitro at positions 2,655 and 2,661, but shows no effect at position 1,067. The 1,067 region is the site of interaction of the antibiotic thiostrepton, which prevents formation of the EF-G-GTP-ribosome complex and is a site for interaction with the GTPase-related protein L11 (ref. 3). The universally conserved loop in the 2,660 region is the site of attack by the RNA-directed cytotoxins alpha-sarcin and ricin, whose effects abolish translation and include the loss of elongation factor-dependent functions in eukaryotic ribosomes.\r"

Phlebotomies were performed at an average gestational age of 32.4 weeks (range 13-40). Changes in mean diastolic blood pressure and pulse were minimal. Electronic fetal monitoring tracings were normal during the 34 procedures in which it was used. The frequency of mild donor reactions (4%) was consistent with that in nonpregnant donors. After entry into this program, 15 patients received a total of 29 U of packed red blood cells (23 autologous; six homologous). Homologous transfusion was avoided in 86.7% of patients receiving blood. Selected pregnant women can participate safely in autologous blood collection programs, minimizing the need, and therefore the risks, of homologous transfusion.\r"

Serum 5-nucleotidase activity did not change between the first and the third trimesters of pregnancy. The elevation of serum 5-nucleotidase activity and of alkaline phosphatase in one case most likely indicated a cholestatic effect of pregnancy, and represented an incidence of 0.45% in the women studied. Among 201 cases, we found a graded and significant increase in the mean (+/- SD) serum sialic acid concentration with progressing pregnancy, from 1.63 +/- 0.3 mmol/L at the onset of pregnancy (five to eight weeks) to 2.06 +/- 0.49 at term; in the last stages of pregnancy, some of the values may overlap with those of cancer patients.

The femur/foot length ratio was also measured directly in 12 fetuses after second-trimester abortion; these measurements compared favorably with the ultrasound femur/foot length ratio nomogram. The discriminatory power of the femur/foot length ratio chart to differentiate fetuses with skeletal dysplasias from those with pseudo-limb reduction due to constitutional factors or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was tested in 16 sequential cases with femur measurements below the fifth percentile. Two cases suspected of having symmetrical IUGR and five cases suspected of being constitutionally small were found to have femur/foot length ratios within the 90th percentile range. Limb reduction deformities were suspected in the nine remaining cases, and the femur/foot length ratios in these fetuses were all found to be less than the fifth percentile. The femur/foot length ratio nomogram appears to be a useful parameter to help differentiate fetuses that have dysplastic limb reduction from those whose limbs are short because of constitutional factors or IUGR.\r"

  ".W": "During a 22-month period, 6288 women undergoing prenatal sonographic studies in the second and third trimesters were evaluated prospectively to determine the incidence of choroid plexus cysts in the fetus, to follow the natural course of these cysts in intrauterine life, and to determine the association of chromosomal and anatomic anomalies in these fetuses. We diagnosed choroid plexus cysts in 41 fetuses, an incidence of 0.65%. Unilateral and bilateral cysts were equally frequent, and in most cases diagnosed by 21 weeks' gestation. On follow-up scans, the cysts had completely disappeared by 23-24 weeks in 80% of the cases, and by 28 weeks in another 10%. Once resolved, the cysts did not recur, and a normal sonogram in the late second trimester predicted normal scans in late pregnancy and in the neonate. One fetus had a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 18). Associated anatomic anomalies were detected in three fetuses, including the one with trisomy 18. We believe that in the great majority of cases, fetal choroid plexus cysts are benign transient variants of normal intracranial anatomy. It is, however, important to conduct a careful sonographic search for associated anomalies. Chromosomal studies are strongly recommended whenever associated anatomic abnormalities are detected and when the choroid plexus cysts are large, bilateral, and persistent beyond 20-22 weeks' gestation.\r"

Current radioimmunoassays for hCG can detect pregnancy as early as eight to 12 days post-conception. The ability to document an intrauterine pregnancy with ultrasound has lagged behind by two to three weeks. New high-frequency endovaginal transducers offer the promise of narrowing this gap. This study was undertaken prospectively on 235 patients all amenorrheic for seven weeks or less and requesting either pregnancy testing or termination. All had endovaginal ultrasound scans. We obtained hCG levels when no sac was seen or when the sac was less than 1.0 cm (initial experience revealed that all sacs over 1.0 cm were associated with hCG levels over 6000 mIU/mL) (International Reference Preparation). Ultrasound findings were correlated with pathology specimens and/or hCG levels where appropriate. Results indicated that normal pregnancies can be imaged when: 1) The sac is greater than 0.4 cm; 2) hCG is greater than 1025 mIU/mL (International Reference Preparation); and 3) the uterus is normal with a homogeneous echo pattern. This was not true in three of our cases with diffuse myomatous changes or a coexisting intrauterine device.\r"

Continuous-wave Doppler studies were performed on the umbilical and uterine arteries of 60 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of preterm labor. Forty patients receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate and 20 patients receiving intravenous ritodrine tocolysis underwent Doppler studies before therapy, during incremental therapy, and four hours post-therapy. There was a statistically significant (P less than .001) progressive decrease in the uterine and umbilical S/D ratios along with a concomitant increase in maternal and fetal heart rate associated with increasing infusion doses of ritodrine. Both the S/D ratios and heart rates returned to pretherapy range four hours after discontinuing therapy. Magnesium sulfate tocolysis was not associated with any significant change in S/D ratios or maternal and fetal heart rate. We conclude that intravenous ritodrine affects umbilical and uterine vascular resistance as measured by S/D ratios. This response may be secondary to changes in maternal and fetal heart rate.\r"

Fetal heart rates (FHRs) were normal, and unchanged from those at rest, during maternal exercise in the water at 60% VO2 maximum. In 21 of 23 cases, post-exercise nonstress tests were reactive within ten minutes. There was no uterine activity seen at either 25 or 35 weeks' gestation. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein was unaffected at all gestational ages. Neither maternal temperature nor calculated plasma volume changed during exercise. This general lack of effect contrasts with results from other studies involving similar levels of exercise on land. We speculate that the plasma volume expansion with immersion contributes to the normal FHR responses seen in this study.\r"

Follow-up of one to four years has revealed maintenance of sexual functioning in 95% of the couples.

The two groups were similar with respect to age, parity, previous abortion, and gestational age. Neither group experienced any unusual complications. The same protocol for intraamniotic PGF2 alpha (40 mg) was used in all patients except for three with histories of asthma, in whom PGE2 vaginal suppositories (20 mg) were used as the induction agent. For the Dilapan group, an average of three devices was used, compared with an average of six in the laminaria group. The mean (+/- SEM) induction-abortion time for Dilapan patients was 10.9 +/- 1.3 hours, compared with 16.1 +/- 1.4 hours in the laminaria group, a statistically significant difference (P less than .05). When nulliparous women were examined separately, the mean times were 11.0 +/- 1.7 for Dilapan and 16.5 +/- 1.6 for laminaria, a medically relevant and statistically significant difference (P less than .05). Dilapan appears to be an effective alternative to laminaria that results in shorter induction-abortion intervals.\r"

These cysts occurred in 102 patients (26.4%), with three patients experiencing cyst-related complications. Mean cyst size at diagnosis was 7.3 cm (3-20 cm), and did not correlate with post-molar trophoblastic disease development. Bilateralism occurred more often in patients developing post-molar trophoblastic disease. In patients with post-molar trophoblastic disease, 83% (45 of 54) experienced theca lutein cyst regression and 16.7% an increase in cyst size with falling beta-hCG titers. Post-molar trophoblastic disease developed in 44 patients. Theca lutein cyst growth occurred in 31.8% of the patients with beta-hCG plateau/rise and in 4.5% with falling titers. Disappearance of theca lutein cysts before diagnosis of post-molar trophoblastic disease occurred in 31.8%. Theca lutein cysts persisted in three patients for long periods (15-18 weeks) after beta-hCG regression. We conclude that theca lutein cysts commonly accompany hydatidiform mole and are associated with an increased risk of post-molar trophoblastic disease, a risk that is higher with cyst bilateralism or severe complications of hydatidiform mole. Theca lutein cysts uncommonly have serious complications; their clinical behavior does not depend entirely on changes in beta-hCG levels, as cysts may persist for long periods after beta-hCG regression.\r"

Laminin with varying defectiveness surrounded invasive foci, whereas adjacent carcinoma in situ or normal epithelium had intact laminin. The amount of laminin usually reflected the degree of tumor differentiation. Absence of laminin around totally keratinized or necrotic tumor nests indicated its dependency on viable cells. New buds from established invasive tumor nests were often more laminin-defective than the parent nest and suggested a cyclic invasive process, with laminin loss during a growth surge followed by laminin reformation during quiescence. In cases of questionable early stromal invasion, deficient laminin could sway the decision toward making a positive diagnosis. The tendency of laminin gaps and tumor buds to contain large malignant cells with pleomorphic nuclei supports the concept of a change in tumor cell metabolism during active invasion. Laminin also appeared around metastatic tumor within lymph nodes. The relationship of inflammation to tumor laminin defectiveness varied.\r"

Eleven patients (30%) achieved ongoing pregnancies; this rate of success is comparable to that with our laparoscopic method. Considering this reasonable pregnancy rate, lack of substantial morbidity, and good patient acceptance, laparoscopic oocyte retrieval for IVF can be largely replaced by the ultrasound-guided transvaginal needle aspiration technique.\r"

One hundred ten volunteers from 29 families completed this study during a naturally occurring outbreak of influenza A (H3N2). Influenza infections, defined as a positive viral throat culture or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer, occurred in 31.0% of children in the placebo group and 7.4% in the rimantadine group (P = 0.026). Clinical illness with laboratory evidence of influenza infection occurred in 24.1% of children in the placebo group and none in the rimantadine group (P = 0.007). Rimantadine was well-tolerated by the children, with no significant difference in reported adverse effects between the placebo and rimantadine groups. A combined analysis by families of these data and those of our similarly designed 1984 study, revealed that families in whom the children were given rimantadine had a significantly lower rate of influenza A infection and influenza-like illness compared with the families in whom the children were given placebo (68.8% vs. 18.8%, P less than 0.001) and (56.3% vs. 12.5%, P less than 0.001), respectively. We conclude that rimantadine prophylaxis of children appears to be an effective method to prevent influenza A (either H1N1 or H3N2) infection and illness in children.\r"

Duplicate throat swabs were obtained from 341 children with pharyngitis. One swab was used in the SUDS test and the other was cultured in the office laboratory. Office SUDS and culture (sheep blood agar plate, aerobic 24-hour incubation) were compared with culture using reference techniques (sheep blood agar plate, anaerobic 48-hour incubation) in a hospital laboratory. Compared with hospital laboratory culture, the sensitivity of office SUDS (73.8%) was superior to that of office culture (66.6%) at P = 0.05. Specificities were 93.1 and 98.6%, respectively; positive predictive values were 86.1 and 96.6%; and negative predictive values were 85.9 and 83.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of SUDS compared with office culture were 88.5 and 87.8%, respectively, but would have been 93 and 94% had hemolyzed media not been used on several occasions in the office culture procedure. We conclude that SUDS Group A Strep was significantly more sensitive than throat cultures as performed in a typical pediatric practice although the performance of office cultures could have been improved by standard quality control techniques.\r"

The 236 effect sizes had an unweighted mean of 0.91 (SD = 0.75) and a weighted mean of 0.33 (SD = 0.01). The weighted mean effect size for studies with control groups (N = 27) was 0.40 (SD = 0.05), and the weighted mean effect size for studies using the one group pretest-posttest design (N = 20) was 0.53 (SD = 0.05). Homogeneity analyses resulted in weighted mean effect size estimates for knowledge subvariables ranging from 0.41 to 0.91; for skill performance, 0.25 to 0.38; for compliance, 0.24 to 1.01; and for metabolic control, 0.06 to 0.84. Experimental mortality was the only variable significantly correlated with the overall weighted mean effect size, r = .52, p = .002. The results of this study clearly support the notion that patient teaching has positive outcomes in diabetic adults. Furthermore, methodological issues were important factors which influenced these findings.\r"

We have detected sequence motifs in bacterial signaling proteins that may act as transmitter or receiver modules in mediating protein-protein communication. These modules appear to retain their functional identities in many protein hosts, implying that they are structurally independent elements. We propose that the fundamental activity characterizing these domains is specific recognition and association of matched modules, accompanied by conformational changes in one or both of the interacting elements. Signal propagation is a natural consequence of this behavior. The versatility of this information-processing strategy is evident in the chemotaxis machinery of Escherichia coli, where proteins containing transmitters or receivers are linked in \"dyadic relays\" to form complex signaling networks.\r"

Indirect immunofluorescence staining of cultured chick retinal explants showed pp60c-src in neuronal growth cones and processes, with the antigen particularly concentrated in growth cones of long neurites. pp60c-src in growth cone membranes was an active tyrosine-specific protein kinase with elevated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity and reduced electrophoretic mobility characteristic of the form of pp60c-src in central nervous system neurons. pp60c-src was present at lower levels in subcellular fractions from mature rat brain but synaptosomal membranes were not enriched. Preferential localization of an active form of pp60c-src in nerve growth cone membranes and persistence of pp60c-src in mature neurons suggest that this tyrosine kinase is important in growth cone-mediated neurite extension and synaptic plasticity.\r"

A single major protein band of 125 kDa was observed on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels that correlated with the elution of GAP activity on Mono Q. Purified GAP was devoid of inherent GTP hydrolytic activity, suggesting that it was a regulator of ras intrinsic GTPase activity. Under submaximal velocity conditions, the second-order rate constant of GTP hydrolysis at 24 degrees C for p21-GTP + GAP (4.5 X 10(6) M-1.sec-1) was at least 1000-fold greater than that for [Val12]p21-GTP + GAP (less than 3 X 10(3) M-1.sec-1).\r"

This c-erbA protein binds 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T3 analogs with affinities similar to those of the authentic T3 receptor. By RNA gel blot analysis, erb62 hybridizes to a 6-kilobase RNA found in organs that express T3 receptors--e.g., heart, kidney, and brain. A COS-cell transient cotransfection system was used to show that erb62 encodes a biologically active T3 receptor. An oligonucleotide, corresponding to a portion of the rat growth hormone gene 5'-flanking region that contains a T3 response element, was inserted on the 5' side of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-expressing plasmid. Reporter gene expression directed by this hybrid promoter was T3 inducible only if this plasmid was cotransfected with an erb62-expressing plasmid.\r"

  ".W": "We have cloned an 82-base-pair region spanning the site of normal 3' end formation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYC1 mRNA into an integrative vector carrying the 5' end of the actin gene (including its intron) fused in frame to HIS4ABC sequences. This vector can confer the ability to grow on histidinol if HIS4C (encoding histidinol dehydrogenase) is sufficiently expressed. With the CYC1 fragment cloned in its wild-type (forward) orientation within the actin intron, transformants cannot grow on histidinol, whereas cells transformed with the vector carrying the reverse orientation of this fragment are able to grow well. RNA transfers demonstrate that transformants containing the forward orientation accumulate less than 40% of the control level of full-length mRNA and reveal the presence of a short, stable (approximately equal to 300 nucleotides) poly(A) RNA that represents 60-70% of the transcripts originating from the same promoter. The reverse orientation of the insert allows near-normal levels of full-length mRNA. Mapping of the 3' end of the truncated RNA indicates that poly(A) addition is variable in length but occurs at the same location as in the normal CYC1 transcript. Dominant and recessive suppressor mutations permit growth on histidinol despite the inserted fragment. Genetic analyses indicate that most of the dominant mutants are cis-acting and that the recessive mutants define a minimum of three complementation groups, indicating that defects in several different genes can restore higher levels of HIS4C expression.\r"

  ".U": "88276896\r", 
  ".W": "Mutations produced in Escherichia coli by apurinic sites are believed to arise via SOS-assisted translesion replication. Analysis of replication products synthesized on depurinated single-stranded DNA by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme revealed that apurinic sites frequently blocked in vitro replication. Bypass frequency of an apurinic site was estimated to be 10-15%. Direct evidence for replicative bypass was obtained in a complete single-stranded----replicative form replication system containing DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, single-stranded DNA binding protein, DNA polymerase I, and DNa ligase, by demonstrating the sensitivity of fully replicated products to the apurinic endonuclease activity of E. coli exonuclease III. Termination at apurinic sites, like termination at pyrimidine photodimers, involved dissociation of the polymerase from the blocked termini, followed by initiations at available primer templates. When no regular primer templates were available, the polymerase underwent repeated cycles of dissociation and rebinding at the blocked termini and, while bound, carried out multiple polymerization-excision reactions opposite the apurinic sites, leading to turnover of dNTPs into dNMPs. From the in vitro turnover rates, we could predict with striking accuracy the specificity of apurinic site mutagenesis, as determined in vivo in depurinated single-stranded DNA from an M13-lac hybrid phage. This finding is consistent with the view that DNA polymerase III holoenzyme carries out the mutagenic \"misinsertion\" step during apurinic site mutagenesis in vivo and that the specificity of the process is determined primarily by the polymerase. SOS-induced proteins such as UmuD/C might act as processivity-like factors to stabilize the polymerase-DNA complex, thus increasing the efficiency of the next stage of past-lesion polymerization required to complete the bypass reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental observations of how unfolded proteins refold to their native three-dimensional structures contrast with many popular theories of protein folding mechanisms. The available experimental evidence (ignoring slow cis-trans peptide bond isomerization) is largely consistent with the following general scheme: under folding conditions, unfolded protein molecules rapidly equilibrate between different conformations prior to complete refolding. This rapid prefolding equilibrium favors certain compact conformations that have somewhat lower free energies than the other unfolded conformations. Some of the favored conformations are important for productive folding. The rate-limiting step occurs late in the pathway and involves a high-energy, distorted form of the native conformation; there appears to be a single transition state through which essentially all molecules refold. Consequently, proteins are not assembled via a large number of independent pathways, nor is folding initiated by a nucleation event in the unfolded protein followed by rapid growth of the folded structure. The known folding pathways involving disulfide bond formation follow the same general principles. An exceptional folding mechanism for reduced ribonuclease A proposed by Scheraga et al. (Scheraga, H.A., Konishi, Y., Rothwarf, D.M. & Mui, P.W. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 5740-5744) is shown to result from experimental shortcomings, an incorrect kinetic analysis, and a failure to consider the kinetics of unfolding.\r"

IgG interferes with the binding of dihydroalprenolol and luteinizing hormone. Monoclonal antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class I antigens were active on the Leydig cells of C3H and BALB/c mice. There was a parallelism between the effect of each individual monoclonal antibody with specificity for a particular haplotype and the response of the target cell from the strains carrying such haplotypes.

To examine the mechanism by which insulin regulates GAPDH mRNA levels in these two insulin-sensitive tissues, we have isolated a functional human GAPDH gene. When stably transfected and expressed in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and H35 hepatoma cells, the intact human GAPDH gene is induced 10-fold by insulin in 3T3-F442A adipocytes and 3-fold by insulin in H35 hepatoma lines, which is similar to the induction obtained with the endogenous gene. A human GAPDH-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct, containing sequences -487 to +20 of the human gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, is regulated by insulin in stably transfected 3T3 adipocytes and stably or transiently transfected H35 hepatoma cell lines, whereas the Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion protein is not. Thus, the inductive effect of insulin on human GAPDH gene expression is mediated through cis-acting sequences located between -487 and +20 of the human GAPDH gene.\r"

  ".W": "Functional characterization of oncogene products that induce cellular transformation has progressed rapidly in recent years. However, less is known about the mechanism(s) by which the transformed cells may escape destruction by host immune defenses and form tumors. A recently described oncogene that has an important association with aggressive human breast carcinoma is \"HER2,\" for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The oncogene has also been called NGL and human c-erbB-2 (ERBB2). In this paper we show that amplification of HER2 oncogene expression can induce resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to the cytotoxic effects of recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) or macrophages. Resistance is accompanied by an increased dissociation constant for rTNF-alpha binding to high-affinity receptors on the HER2-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. The resistance phenotype is independent of transformation since NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the activated human homologue of the Harvey-ras oncogene (HRAS) retain high-affinity binding sites for rTNF-alpha as well as sensitivity to its cytotoxic effects. These results suggest that HER2 may potentiate tumorigenesis by inducing tumor cell resistance to host defense mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "A comparative analysis of T24 human bladder carcinoma cells and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MeNNG)-transformed derivatives (MeNNG-T24 cells) revealed the following: (i) The presence of an activated c-Ha-ras gene (in the absence of the normal allele) is insufficient to confer upon T24 cells a tumor-associated phenotype. (ii) MeNNG-transformed T24 cells not only acquire tumor-associated (in vitro) traits (growth in soft agar and rhodamine retention) but, are highly tumorigenic in nude mice. (iii) It is possible to render T24 cells tumorigenic by chemical transformation; therefore, the reason that T24 cells lack tumorigenicity is not because of possible incompatibilities between these cells and nude mice but, in fact, because T24 cells are not malignant. (iv) The loss of expression of a transformation-related Mr 67,000 phosphoprotein by MeNNG-T24 cells after explantation of these cells from nude mouse tumors to in vitro culture indicates that culture conditions can be responsible for rapid phenotypic conversion of human tumor cell lines.\r"

We propose as a general evolutionary principle that anagenic advances often come from capitalizing on preexisting latent selection potentials in the presence of novel ecological opportunity.\r"

A 3.8-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI restriction fragment encompassing the 5' end of the human p53 gene, as well as subfragments generated by restriction digests, was cloned upstream of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and CAT activity was assayed in extracts of transfected cells. Two types of CAT vectors were used: Epstein-Barr virus oriP-derived constructs that were stably introduced into the human cell lines K562, Raji, and HL-60, and pSV0-CAT-derived constructs that were transiently introduced into the monkey cell line COS. By this approach we have identified two promoters for the human p53 gene. One promoter, p53P1, is located 100-250 bp upstream of the 218-bp noncoding first exon; a second, stronger promoter, p53P2, maps within the first intron. CAT activity and expression of CAT RNA indicate that p53P2 functions up to 50-fold more efficiently than p53P1. We conclude that the expression of the human p53 gene may be controlled by two promoters and that differential regulation of these promoters may play an important role in the altered expression of the gene in both normal and transformed cells.\r"

  ".U": "88276923\r", 
  ".W": "The CD4 (T4) antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly on the surface of helper T cells and has been implicated in the regulation of T-cell activation and in the associative recognition of class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex. In addition, the CD4 antigen appears to serve as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An important question has been whether the CD4 receptor is linked to an intracellular mediator that could regulate the activation of the CD4+ subset. In this paper, we provide preliminary evidence that the CD4 receptor is complexed in detergent lysates to a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) of 55-60 kDa, which is expressed specifically in T cells. The PTK is the human analogue of the murine pp56LSTRA (pp56lck) and has significant homology with c-src, c-yes, and other members of the src family. The identification of the PTK associated with CD4 receptor was made by use of an antiserum to a synthetic peptide that was deduced from the DNA sequence of PTK. Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis/NaDodSO4/PAGE revealed the kinase to focus as a heterogeneous collection of spots in the pH range of 4.0-5.0. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation revealed the phosphorylation of two additional polypeptides at 40 and 80 kDa, in addition to the autophosphorylation of the PTK at 55-60 kDa. The potential importance of the association between the CD4 receptor and the PTK of T cells is discussed in relation to T-cell activation and HIV infectivity.\r"

Clone Ag512 corresponds to a Mr 55,000 merozoite rhoptry antigen, and clone Ag513 corresponds to a Mr 45,000 merozoite surface antigen. Both proteins can be biosynthetically labeled with [3H]glucosamine and [3H]myristic acid, suggesting that they may be anchored in membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. Similarities in the C-terminal sequences of the Mr 45,000 merozoite surface antigen and the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoproteins provides further evidence that this antigen has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.\r"

The recombinant preparation was effective in eliciting cellular and humoral immunity as well as immunologic memory. Anti-rgp 120 antibodies reacted with authentic viral gp120 in immunological blot assays and were able to neutralize HIV-1 infectivity in vitro. Sera from the rgp120-immunized animals were able to neutralize HIV-1 pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus prepared from the IIIB isolate, from which the gene encoding rgp120 was derived, as well as two heterologous isolates, ARV-2 and RF. The immune response elicited against the rgp120 was not effective in preventing viral infection after intravenous challenge with HIV-1. The implications of these results on HIV-1 vaccine development are discussed.\r"

Twenty-one days thereafter, the injected and control sites were biopsied, and the histology, number of acid-fast bacilli, nature and phenotype of the emigrant cells, and ultrastructural characteristics of the lesions were evaluated. Eight of the 10 responding patients showed reductions in the number of acid-fast bacilli by factors ranging from 5 to 10,000. Two responders and both nonresponders exhibited no discernible decline in the number of organisms. The reduction in bacillary load was correlated with an intense mononuclear cell infiltrate, the maintenance of a high CD4+ T-cell/CD8+ T-cell ratio, the formation of granulomata, and the extensive destruction of previously parasitized macrophages.\r"

We tested sera from 17 HIV-seronegative and 68 HIV-seropositive subjects in an enzyme immunoassay. No HIV antibody-negative serum reacted with any of the peptides. The peptide HIV-env 583-599 has a sequence similarity with immunosuppressive peptides derived from the transmembrane proteins of other retroviruses. Antibodies to this 17-mer (HIV-env 583-599; hereafter also referred to as pHIVIS, putative HIV immunosuppressive sequence) were detected in 27 of the 35 sera from healthy HIV-positive persons but only in 1 of the 33 sera from patients with HIV-related disease. Another 17-mer, displaced four amino acids N-terminally from pHIVIS, reacted with fewer of the sera from healthy seropositive subjects than pHIVIS but with no serum from ill seropositive patients. HIV-env 586-603, which shares two-thirds of its sequence with pHIVIS, reacted with the sera from nearly all subjects, regardless of clinical status. The remaining five peptides did not discriminate between healthy and ill seropositive subjects either but gave lower reactivity rates. HIV-positive sera thus exhibited distinct patterns of reactivity with subsequences of gp41. We have mapped two overlapping epitopes within a narrow part of gp41; antibodies to the most N-terminally located of the two--i.e., the pHIVIS-reactive antibodies--might counteract a possible immunosuppressive effect of gp41.\r"

We determined the subcellular distribution of HMG-CoA reductase at high resolution by means of immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin frozen liver sections of rats treated with lovastatin and cholestyramine. High concentrations of reductase were located on the outer (cytoplasmic) surfaces of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) membranes induced in hepatocytes by acute drug administration. The enzyme was specifically localized over the whorled SER membranes and was absent from nonwhorled SER, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes. Intense HMG-CoA reductase labeling was only observed in hepatocytes containing high levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity; no staining was detected in untreated livers. These observations show that HMG-CoA reductase is induced as an integral component of the SER membranes that form in rat hepatocytes subsequent to lovastatin treatment and suggest that the formation of SER whorls in rat hepatocytes is due to mechanism-based effects of lovastatin.\r"

Criteria for NGF receptor expression included protein accumulation and cell-surface immunofluorescent staining with a monoclonal antibody directed against the human receptor and induction of the messenger RNA species as determined by blot-hybridization studies. The presence of the receptor could also be induced by UV irradiation or growth factor deprivation. The NGF receptor is inducible in cultured human melanocytes, and we suggest that NGF may modulate the behavior of this neural crest-derived cell in the skin.\r"

Bilateral lesions of the LGN, which destroyed the connection from the intergeniculate leaflet to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, blocked phase-shift responses to triazolam.

Both stereoisomers of aspartate were effective, whereas kainate, quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and D-glutamate were ineffective. The presence of Na+ was essential to response generation; even Li+ could not substitute for Na+. The relation between L-glutamate-induced current and the membrane voltage was strongly inward-rectifying. These results favor the hypothesis that the L-glutamate-induced response is generated by an electrogenic uptake carrier. However, L-glutamate-induced current was always accompanied by an increase in current fluctuations, a phenomenon commonly observed in ion channels but not expected for an uptake carrier. Although the underlying mechanism needs further elucidation, it seems likely that L-glutamate is a transmitter for communication between photoreceptors.\r"

Neural crest cells were taken from quail embryos at the level encompassing mesencephalon and metencephalon and the developmental potentials were evaluated by culturing them as single cells on 3T3 feeder layers. Such conditions proved to be particularly favorable for survival, proliferation, and differentiation of quail neural crest cells. Two hundred and forty-three clones that contained from 1 to greater than 20,000 cells were analyzed after 7-10 days of culture. Phenotype analysis provided evidence for the existence of cells with extremely diverse developmental potencies. A few committed neuron progenitors were observed as well as some pluripotent cells, able to differentiate into several types of neurons, non-neuronal cells, and melanocytes, and many cells with intermediate developmental potencies. These cloning experiments revealed the striking heterogeneity of migrating neural crest cells in terms of their capacity for differentiation and their potential for proliferation.\r"

We previously showed that the protein encoded by this gene is unique among cellular oncogene products in that it has seven hydrophobic potential transmembrane domains and shares strong sequence similarity with a family of hormone-receptor proteins. We have now cloned the rat homolog of the mas oncogene, determined its DNA sequence, and examined its expression in various rat tissues. A comparison of the predicted sequences of the rat and human mas proteins shows that they are highly conserved, except in their hydrophilic amino-terminal domains. Our examination of the expression of mas, determined by RNA-protection studies, indicates that high levels of mas RNA transcripts are present in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the brain, but not in other neural regions or in other tissues. This pattern of expression and the similarity of mas protein to known receptor proteins suggest that mas encodes a receptor that is involved in the normal neurophysiology and/or development of specific neural tissues.\r"

No complications or sequelae occurred after 271 treatments. All lesions were smaller after 6-27 months follow-up. No evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was present at fine-needle biopsy or contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT). No viable tumor cells were detected in four patients who subsequently underwent surgery. The 1-year survival rate of 12 patients was 91.7%. From these data, it can be concluded that percutaneous alcohol injection (PAI) is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma lesions who are poor surgical risks. Given the risk of new nodular lesions occurring on resected livers and the risk of perioperative mortality, PAI might even be considered an alternative to surgery.\r"

Duplex sonography demonstrated high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (97%) for the diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm in group 1. Of the 19 studies in group 2, duplex sonography allowed correct identification of pseudoaneurysms in four studies and exclusion of this entity in six examinations. The duplex sonographic findings in nine studies in this group did not allow differentiation of pseudoaneurysm from true aneurysm or oversize graft anastomosis. Duplex sonography is suggested as a primary radiologic method for evaluating possible pseudoaneurysms after arterial puncture, and it may provide valuable information and a means of postsurgical follow-up of selected patients as well.\r"

Biopsy was performed in 77 cases, 83% (64 of 77) for abnormalities detected with transrectal US and 38% (29 of 77) because of findings at digital examination. Twenty-two cancers were detected, 20 with transrectal US and ten at digital examination. Overall detection rate for prostate cancer with transrectal US was two times higher than that with digital examination (2.6% vs 1.3%). Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value for transrectal US and digital examination were calculated for a range of prevalences (0.028-0.1543). Sensitivity was two times higher for transrectal US than for digital examination. Transrectal US demonstrated 100% (17 of 17) of tumors with the most favorable prognosis (less than or equal to 1.5 cm in diameter) compared with 41% (seven of 17) for digital examination. The authors conclude that transrectal US is more sensitive than digital examination in the detection of prostate cancer, and they advocate broader implementation and evaluation of transrectal US as a tool for early detection.\r"

Clean, intermittent catheterization of the reservoir (pouch) at regular intervals obviates the inconvenience of wearing an external stomal appliance. A variety of surgical techniques have been described for continent pouches. These techniques make use of the small bowel alone (Camey and Kock techniques) or a combination of cecum and terminal ileum (Indiana, Mainz, Penn, and King techniques). The optimum pouch protects the upper tracts by prevention of reflux, provides urinary continence, and has sufficient capacity to require catheterization no more frequently than every 3-6 hours. Simplified construction techniques for the commonly encountered pouches are graphically presented, and a method is suggested for the study of continent diversions.\r"

Eleven of 20 (55%) had complete resolution on angiograms or MR images, 35% had partial resolution, and 10% showed no size change. Before treatment, the size range of the AVMs was 0.86-383 cm3 (median, 21.7 cm3). Smaller AVMs (less than 8 cm3) were more likely to resolve completely than medium-sized AVMs (8-64 cm3) or larger AVMs (greater than 64 cm3). Four additional patients had slow-flow vascular malformations: One had a venous angioma; one, a probable cavernous hemangioma; and two, malformations that were not seen on angiograms. CT proved inaccurate in demonstrating the boundaries of the AVM after treatment because it showed persistent contrast enhancement even when the AVM was completely obliterated on angiograms. MR imaging and angiography were complementary in the evaluation of therapeutic results and should be the primary modalities in the examination of patients with AVMs.\r"

  ".U": "88277245\r", 
  ".W": "To place the characteristics of the coronary microcirculation in perspective to another muscular organ system, we have compared various parameters from exchange vessels in the heart and red skeletal muscle. The major differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle microcirculations relate to the larger density of capillaries in the heart. This increased density is responsible primarily for a greater capillary filtration coefficient-permeability-surface area product to various solutes, surface area, and decreased intercapillary distances. These features most likely represent an adaptation of the microcirculation of the heart to the very high, continual metabolic demands. Interestingly, capillary permeabilities and reflection coefficients of different solutes are in the same range (although the heart tends to have higher capillary permeabilities). Thus, the adaptation of the coronary circulation to facilitate exchange of nutrients and solutes is mediated via an increase in the numbers of exchange vessels, rather than modifications of the membrane characteristics of these exchange vessels. Within the last decade, there has been much information assimilated on the regulation of the coronary microcirculation. Most of the knowledge has been the result of many indirect approaches to studying the coronary microcirculation (indicator-dilution techniques, nuclide-labeled microspheres, plasma-lymph concentration of solutes). There are relatively few direct observations on regulation of the coronary microcirculation. This is primarily due to difficulties in techniques. Exploration of the phasic nature of intramyocardial perfusion is handicapped by the location of these intramuscular vessels. Visualization of the coronary microcirculation is hampered by movements of the heart, and such measurements are restricted to the superficial layers of the myocardium. It is worth emphasizing that direct observations of red cell velocities in epicardial capillaries, measurements of microvascular caliber, and the pressure profiles in the coronary microcirculation are restricted to the superficial, epicardial layer. It is not unreasonable to speculate that microvascular events and regulation occurring in the subepicardium may be quite different than that in the subendocardium. There are several salient points in this review that are worth emphasizing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone that is highly active against many diverse microorganisms. At concentrations of less than 1 microgram/mL it is active against most gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and other Pasteurellaceae, Vibrionaceae, and various species of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Most staphylococci, including strains resistant to methicillin, are also susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Streptococci are not highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and obligate anaerobes are generally resistant to this and other quinolones. Ciprofloxacin, like other quinolones, inhibits DNA gyrase, but its bactericidal effects are not completely reversible by inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. Thus, unlike many other quinolones, ciprofloxacin may have multiple lethal effects. Resistance is less readily selected in vitro by ciprofloxacin than by nalidixic acid, and single-step mutants usually remain susceptible to clinically achievable concentrations. Resistance mediated by mutations in genes altering DNA gyrase and expression of outer membrane proteins has been described for ciprofloxacin and other quinolones. The antimicrobial spectrum and potency of ciprofloxacin, coupled with its rapid bactericidal effects, make this fluoroquinolone a promising new antimicrobial agent.\r"

  ".W": "Ciprofloxacin is a new 4-quinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, chlamydiae, rickettsiae, and related organisms. The drug has been administered orally to 2,018 patients, primarily in the United States. In open trials oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to constitute effective therapy for osteomyelitis, gonorrhea, and infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, respiratory tree, and skin and soft tissues. In controlled comparative trials, most of which were doubly blinded, oral ciprofloxacin was equal in terms of safety and therapeutically equal or superior to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in urinary and gastrointestinal infections, to oral ampicillin in respiratory infections, and to parenteral cefotaxime in skin and soft tissue disease. Adverse reactions were infrequent and generally mild. The emergence of resistance was encountered rarely; the organisms implicated were usually those for which initial minimal inhibitory concentrations were high, albeit in the sensitive range (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin potentiates the toxicity of theophylline. Concurrent administration of antacids may diminish gastrointestinal absorption of the drug.\r"

Reports of condyloma acuminatum lesions in the oral cavity are appearing more frequently, although they still are sparse. Four cases of oral condyloma are described, and the English-language literature on other such cases is reviewed. Presumably, as the incidence of this type of infection continues to increase, oral condylomata will become a commoner diagnosis. Physicians and dentists should be aware of the necessity of recognizing wart-like eruptions in and around the oral cavity.\r"

Safe regimens of pentavalent antimony in the form of Pentostam (Wellcome Foundation, London; 20 mg of antimony/[kg.d] for 20-30 days) have produced initial cure rates of greater than 90% in these diseases. Biochemical investigations have demonstrated at least three parasite-specific features relevant to the mechanism of action of chemotherapeutic agents: (1) Organization of glycolytic enzymes and some enzymes of fatty acid catabolism into organelles (glycosomes) occurs in Leishmania but not in mammalian cells. Since antimony inhibits both amastigote catabolism of glucose via glycolytic enzymes and catabolism of fatty acids, the mechanism of action of antimony may relate to alteration of glycosomal structure or function. (2) Purine analogues can be utilized by the salvage pathway of purine biosynthesis in amastigotes to a greater extent than in mammalian cells, and allopurinol and allopurinol ribonucleoside are metabolized into presumably toxic nucleotides by these means. (3) Amastigote sterol biosynthesis is akin to that of such fungi as Candida in that the major demethylated sterol is of the ergostane series and in that ketoconazole inhibits its synthesis. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the purines and the sterol inhibitors may have clinical utility as oral agents against cutaneous leishmaniasis. Possible treatment strategies for the classic and experimental agents have been proposed.\r"

These organisms have long been noted to constitute a significant number of the beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates from throats of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in a variety of populations. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the usefulness of anaerobic atmosphere and prolonged incubation in maximizing isolation of the BHNAS. More recently, genetic studies have furthered our appreciation of the taxonomy and have defined two major groups: Streptococcus anginosus-milleri group and large-colony BHNAS; the latter can be further separated on the basis of serogrouping and biotyping. Recognition of this diversity gives justification to the reexamination of the epidemiology and disease course of BHNAS pharyngitis. Treatment studies will also be required if all or subsets of these organisms can be confirmed as pharyngeal pathogens.\r"

Cases of bacteremia (n = 14) were commonly associated with trauma or manipulation of the genitourinary tract and were often self-limited. Wound infections (n = 14) followed surgery by 4-14 days in most cases and may have arisen from contamination from the genitourinary or respiratory tract. Joint infections (n = 5) appeared to have resulted from bacteremic seeding in some cases and affected prosthetic joints in particular. Least frequent were central nervous system infections (one case of meningitis and two of brain abscess) and respiratory tract infections (three cases of empyema). The large majority of patients had fever, and infected fluid collections were commonly purulent. The response to therapy was difficult to assess in many cases, but responses to tetracycline, clindamycin, and drainage alone were observed. Identification of M. hominis requires clinical suspicion and alertness on the part of the bacteriology laboratory.\r"

All patients with natural infections had lived or traveled in the Far East. Nine of these patients were Chinese, all from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The four additional infections from Guangxi reported herein bring the total to 21 natural infections. P. marneffei is a primary pathogen of humans, causing two clinical types of disease: focal infection and fatal, progressive, disseminated infection. There are three histopathologic reactions: (1) granulomatous; (2) suppurative; and (3) anergic and necrotizing. The first two reactions are seen in patients with \"normal\" immunity and the third in patients with compromised immunity. P. marneffei is unique among species of Penicillium because of its thermal dimorphism, its recognized ecologic niche (restricted to the Far East), and its propensity to infect the lungs and the reticuloendothelial system and to proliferate within histiocytes.\r"

Ross, who received the Nobel Prize in 1902 for his discovery that certain mosquitoes transmit malaria, resented de Kruif's personal remarks and his version of the malaria story, especially concerning the disputes with Italian workers over priorities. In a little-known polemic \"review\" of Microbe Hunters, Ross castigated de Kruif for statements he considered libelous. While Ross could not sue for libel across the Atlantic, his threatened action for libel forced the publisher of the British edition of Microbe Hunters to delete the chapter about Ross and one about David Bruce, Ross's countryman. de Kruif's book, a best-seller in its day and influential among the young for a generation, now seems gauche and anachronistic. While Ross seems to have been justified in some of his complaints about Microbe Hunters, the bitter tone of his reactions all but confirms de Kruif's opinion of him. Ross died in 1932 with a permanent niche in medical history; de Kruif died in 1971 and is little remembered except, perhaps, for Microbe Hunters.\r"

However, the lack of understanding of mechanisms of protective immunity against HIV-1, the magnitude of genetic variation of the virus, and the lack of effective animal models for HIV-1 infection and AIDS have impeded progress. The testing of AIDS vaccines also presents challenges. These include liability concerns over vaccine-related injuries; identification of suitable populations for phase 3 efficacy studies; balancing the ethical obligation to counsel research subjects to avoid high-risk behavior with the necessity to obtain vaccine efficacy data; and the effect of vaccine-induced seroconversion on the recruiting and welfare of trial volunteers. Several candidate AIDS vaccines are nevertheless currently under development, and some are undergoing phase 1 clinical trials. Rapid progress will depend on continued scientific advancement in conjunction with maximum use of resources, open information and reagent exchange, and a spirit of international collaboration.\r"

The reported numbers of daily symptoms of physical discomfort were recorded during the preprocedure period. Analysis of variance results indicated that patients in all three groups experienced a significant decline in the number of symptoms of physical discomfort over the six-day withdrawal period. Further findings provided evidence of significantly fewer symptoms of discomfort for patients in the anesthetic treatment groups than in the placebo control group, though no statistically significant difference emerged between the two anesthetic treatment groups.

Actuarial graft functional survival was 80% at 12 months; living related donor graft survival of 94% at one year was comparatively better than the 66% with cadaveric grafts. Death from excessive pharmacologic immunosuppression did not occur. Graft survival was excellent with living donor and acceptable with cadaveric grafts, especially with good tissue matching.

With the use of fast imaging techniques, we can acquire images with essentially high temporal resolution so that cardiac function can be quantitated. Moreover, the use of proton and 31P MR spectroscopy provides additional information, which should enable the sequential monitoring of both cardiac function and metabolism.\r"
