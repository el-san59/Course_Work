  ".W": "Objective: To determine whether exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE), either transplacentally or through breast feeding, affected scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6 or 12 months of age. DESIGN: Cohort followed from birth to 1 year of age. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 858 infants, of whom 802 had Bayley scores available at either 6 months or 12 months or both. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bayley scales and chemical measurements were done independently. Higher transplacental exposure to PCBs was associated with lower psychomotor scores at both 6 and 12 months of age; the difference between the mean scores in the lowest and highest PCB groups was 7 points at 6 months and 8 points at 12 months. Higher transplacental exposure to DDE was associated with higher mental scores at 6 months of age (the difference between the mean scores in the lowest and highest DDE groups was 6 points), but no relationship was seen at 12 months. Exposure to either chemical through breast feeding was apparently unrelated to Bayley scores. Conclusions: Transplacental exposure to PCBs was associated with lower psychomotor scores. No deleterious effects were associated with breast feeding.\r"

  ".W": "Variable region genes from mouse monoclonal antibody 17-1A (gamma 2a kappa) with specificity for human gastrointestinal malignancies have been paired with human immunoglobulin constant region genes (for heavy and light chains) to produce mouse/human chimeric immunoglobulin molecules (chIgG) for each of the four human IgG subclasses. Mouse 17-1A and the four chIgG bound similarly to two human colon cancer cell lines and had comparable binding affinities. The chIgG1 and chIgG3 molecules mediated lymphocyte and monocyte antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to colon cancer tumor cell lines comparable to that of the parent murine 17-1A. The chIgG2 and chIgG4 molecules were able to mediate ADCC to colon cancer cell lines but were clearly inferior to the chIgG1 and chIgG3 reagents. None of the chIgG antibodies or the murine 17-1A was able to mediate complement lysis of colon cancer cell lines. These studies demonstrate the ability to produce all four human IgG subclass chimeric molecules which retain biologic activity. We have confirmed the subclass preferences of human lymphocyte and monocyte Fc receptors for human IgG subclasses previously determined by studies with monomeric or aggregated IgG. These data may aid in the selection of chimeric antibodies for in vivo trials.\r"

In the isolated perfused rat liver, carbaryl was removed by a high intrinsic clearance process, which was inhibited in a dose dependent fashion by cimetidine in the concentration range of 60-240 micrograms/ml. The pharmacokinetic profile in one subject for orally administered carbaryl was altered following administration of cimetidine (200 mg every eight hours for three days). The peak carbaryl level occurred 25 minutes later and was increased by twofold, due to a 46% reduction in apparent oral clearance. The observations indicate that cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of carbaryl in both rat and man. These data suggest that administration of cimetidine to individuals exposed to carbaryl could result in enhanced toxicity.\r"

Eight weekly instillations were given followed by cystoscopy 4 weeks after the treatment was stopped. The over-all complete response rate based on cystoscopy and either biopsy or cytology was 26 per cent for thiotepa versus 39 per cent for mitomycin C (p equals 0.08). The greatest efficacy was seen in the Ta group with mitomycin C demonstrating superiority over thiotepa. Patients with negative cystoscopy and biopsy but who had positive cytology were considered to be partial responders. When partial and complete responders were combined the over-all response rate was 53 per cent for thiotepa and 63 per cent for mitomycin C (p equals 0.23). Patients with TIS appeared to respond equally to thiotepa and mitomycin C. Toxicity included urinary frequency in 22 of the 73 patients in the thiotepa arm and 31 of the 76 patients receiving mitomycin C. A rash was observed in 2 of the thiotepa group versus 14 of the mitomycin C group. Bone marrow depression occurred in 15 patients receiving thiotepa and in 12 receiving mitomycin C.\r"

Patients with positive surgical margins or nodes were treated adjunctively with external beam radiotherapy, 4,500 to 5,000 rad, and chemotherapy. Patients with bulky disease were treated with preoperative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy followed by an exenterative operation. Of the 11 patients 9 are without evidence of disease with a mean followup of 61 months (range 35 to 96 months). One patient was lost to followup after 4 months and 1 died of disease after 11 months. Three patients with rhabdomyosarcoma were treated and 1 had no evidence of disease 24 months after therapy. Two patients died at 4 and 18 months.\r"

Endoscopy was done at entry and after 1, 2, and 3 months of continuous treatment with 100 micrograms or 200 micrograms misoprostol or placebo, given four times daily with meals and at bedtime, concurrently with the NSAID. Abdominal pain was rated independently by patients and physicians. A treatment failure was defined as development of a gastric ulcer. Gastric ulcers (0.3 cm in diameter or greater) occurred less frequently (p less than 0.001) in both misoprostol treatment groups (5.6% 100 micrograms and 1.4% 200 micrograms) than in the placebo group (21.7%). The significant difference in ulcer formation between the placebo and the misoprostol treatment groups remained when comparisons were restricted to ulcers greater than 0.5 cm in diameter (12.3% placebo, 4.2% 100 micrograms misoprostol, and 0.7% 200 micrograms misoprostol). Mild to moderate, self-limiting diarrhoea was the most frequently reported adverse effect attributed to misoprostol. These results provide the first clear indication that NSAID-induced ulcers are preventable.\r"

As transposable elements have greatly facilitated genetic analysis in a variety of species, we have attempted to identify an endogenous A. thaliana transposable element. We report here the discovery of a family of such elements, which we refer to as Ta1 elements. Sequence analysis of one such element shows that it is closely related to retrotransposons and integrated retroviral proviruses, being bound by a direct sequence repeat and having an open reading frame with clear sequence similarity to the polyprotein of the Drosophila melanogaster retrotransposon copia. The sequence of an empty target site of a Ta1 element shows that insertion is accompanied by a five-base-pair target-site duplication and that Ta1 has transposed in the period of time since divergence of two races of A. thaliana.\r"

  ".W": "A surprising recent finding is that thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and cortisol binding globulin (CBG), are members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Apparently evolution has completely adapted the serpin structure for its new role in these proteins as a transport agent, as there is no evidence of any retained protease inhibitory activity. This drastic change in function raises the question as to why such a complex molecular framework has been selected for the relatively simple task of hormone transport? To function as inhibitors the serpins have a native stressed (S) conformation that makes them vulnerable to proteolytic cleavage, the cleavage being accompanied by an irreversible transition to a stable relaxed (R) form. We demonstrate here that TBG and CBG have retained the stressed native structure typical of the inhibitor members of the family and we provide evidence that the S-R transition has been adapted to allow altered hormone delivery at inflammatory sites.\r"

  ".W": "Many pathogenic bacteria express pili (fimbriae) on their cell surfaces. These structures mediate binding of bacteria to host tissues, and may also be involved in other aspects of pathogenesis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae pili are mainly composed of a single protein, pilin, whose expression is controlled at chromosomal expression loci (pilE). An intact pilin gene and promoter sequences are only found at pilE. Strain MS11 contains two expression sites (pilE1 and pilE2), whereas several of its derivatives and other clinical isolates contain only one. Silent pilin loci (pilS1-pilS7) contain truncated variant pilin genes lacking the promoter and conserved pilin gene sequences. Pilin antigenic variation in N. gonorrhoeae occurs by DNA recombination between one of he silent partial variant gene segments in pilS and an expressed pilin gene in pilE. The recombination reactions are nonreciprocal, and therefore the mechanism has been classified as gene conversion. We report that much of the recombination between pilin loci actually occurs after transformation of living piliated cells by DNA liberated from lysed cells within a population. This constitutes a new molecular mechanism for an antigenic variation system, as well as the first specific function for a DNA transformation system.\r"

Class II-bearing B lymphocytes and M phi/DC possess antigen presenting cell (APC) function; that is, they can stimulate T lymphocytes reactive to either antigen plus MHC or foreign MHC alone. To assess whether non-bone-marrow-derived cells can acquire APC function and elicit graft rejection through expression of class II, we studied transgenic pancreatic islet beta cells that express a foreign class II (I-E) molecule. In vivo, grafts of I-E+ transgenic islets into I-E- naive hosts are not rejected unless the host is primed by an injection of I-E+ spleen cells. In vitro, the I-E+ beta cells are unable to stimulate T lymphocytes reactive to I-E plus a peptide antigen. Paradoxically, they induce antigen specific unresponsiveness in the T cells. We propose that expression of class II on non-lymphoid cells may serve as an extrathymic mechanism for maintaining self tolerance.\r"

In vertebrates these molecules regulate diverse biological processes such as pattern formation, cellular differentiation and homeostasis. The universal necessity for embryonic and adult cells to respond to their external environment might mean that members of this family pre-date the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates. We have screened a Drosophila genomic library for steroid receptor homologues using a human retinoic acid receptor complementary DNA as a hybridization probe. Several clones were recovered, one of which mapped to chromosomal position 77E1-2, the cytological location of the gap segmentation gene knirps. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone representing the human retinoic acid receptor homologue showed similarity of the predicted protein to the vertebrate steroid receptors, as well as to the predicted knirps gene product. In situ hybridization of a cDNA probe to wild-type embryos revealed a uniform distribution of transcripts that were apparently maternally derived. Zygotic transcript accumulation begins in a broad anteroventral domain before the cellular blastoderm stage. At the cellular blastoderm stage two additional circumferential bands of transcript appear.\r"

  ".U": "89057827\r", 
  ".W": "Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), the enzyme that transfers the myristoyl (14:0) moiety from myristoyl CoA thioester to nascent proteins, is remarkably specific for both peptide and fatty acyl CoA substrates. To investigate the interaction of NMT with fatty acyl CoA substrates, we have synthesized 10 oxygen- or sulfur-substituted fatty acid analogs. These analogs differ dramatically in hydrophobicity from naturally occurring fatty acids of similar length. As acylpeptides, sulfur-substituted myristic acid analogs migrate on reverse-phase HPLC like 11:0 or 12:0 fatty acids, while oxygen-substituted analogs migrate like 9:0 to 11:0 fatty acids. CoA thioesters of several of these analogs serve as good NMT substrates in vitro, implying that NMT selects fatty acyl substrates primarily on the basis of chain length rather than hydrophobicity. Myristelaidoyl (14:1, delta 9,10-trans) CoA is also a significantly better substrate than myristoleoyl (14:1, delta 9,10-cis) CoA. The fatty acyl group bound to NMT profoundly influences the rate of acylpeptide formation and the affinity of NMT for peptide substrates. However, the peptide substrate bound to NMT does not produce significant alterations in the enzyme's affinity for myristoyl CoA. In vitro characterization of these heteroatom substituted analogs suggests that they will be efficiently incorporated into proteins in vivo and may markedly alter acylprotein targeting and function.\r"

  ".W": "The study of specific trans-acting transcription factors in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes has been greatly facilitated by genetic analysis of mutant strains deficient in such factors. We have developed such a system to study mammalian trans-acting factors that regulate the transcription of class II major histocompatibility complex genes, using the mutant cell lines RM2 and RM3. These cells, derived from the human B-cell line Raji, specifically fail to transcribe their class II major histocompatibility complex genes. Here we show that a transfected HLA-DR alpha class II major histocompatibility complex gene, like the endogenous HLA-DR alpha genes, is efficiently transcribed in Raji cells but not in RM2 or RM3 cells, demonstrating that the mutant cells are deficient in a specific trans-acting factor required for transcription of these genes. HLA-DR expression in RM2 and RM3 cells is rescued by fusion to another B-cell line but not by fusion to each other. Thus, the defects in the two cell lines are recessive and noncomplementing and define a locus whose wild-type product we designate TF-X1. We show that TF-X1 influences the activity of a 24-base-pair B-cell-specific cis-acting transcription element in the HLA-DR alpha promoter. However, in three different biochemical assays, we detect no difference between wild-type and mutant cells in the DNA-binding proteins that interact with these DNA sequences. Thus, the defective version of TF-X1 may be a DNA-binding protein that binds to the HLA-DR alpha promoter but fails to activate transcription. Alternatively, TF-X1 may not be a DNA-binding protein at all.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the mechanism of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) coupling of receptors to phospholipase C. The Xenopus oocyte has a muscarinic receptor-activated Cl- current that is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Modulation of the muscarinic receptor-evoked Cl- current was examined under voltage clamp in oocytes injected with resolved G-protein subunits. The presence of an alpha subunit of G proteins in oocytes was shown by pertussis toxin-labeling of a 41-kDa band in oocyte membranes. The presence of the beta subunit of G proteins was demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments with an antiserum (U-49) that is specific for the beta subunit. Pertussis toxin treatment of oocytes resulted in the uncoupling of muscarinic receptors from activation of the Cl- current. Cells microinjected with 1.5 ng of human erythrocyte beta gamma-subunit complex or 1.0 ng of bovine brain beta gamma-subunit complex showed approximately a 95% reduction in the evoked Cl- current. Cells injected with equal volumes of protein storage vehicle showed no change in response. Cells injected with boiled beta gamma subunits, bovine serum albumin, or resolved alpha subunits also showed no reduction in response. Cells injected with various concentrations of beta gamma subunits showed a concentration dependence with half-maximal inhibition of the muscarinic activated Cl- current at about 10 nM. Cells injected with 1.0 ng of bovine brain beta gamma subunits could not respond to bath-applied agonist but could generate the Cl- current on intracellular injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These observations suggest that there is a G protein responsible for muscarinic receptor-mediated signal transduction through phospholipase C and that it is an alpha beta gamma heterotrimer. It appears that the mode of action of the G protein in the phospholipase C system may be similar to that of the hormone-activated adenylyl cyclase.\r"

This release is generally thought to be mediated by an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Recent evidence suggests that there might be factors that modulate the coupling between Ca2+ levels and mediator release. The present report identifies adenosine as one such modulator. Adenosine and several of its metabolically stable analogues were shown to enhance histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells in response to stimuli such as concanavalin A. Metabolizing endogenous adenosine with adenosine deaminase dampened the response to stimuli, whereas trapping endogenous adenosine inside mast cells with nucleoside-transport inhibitors markedly enhanced stimulated histamine release. The metabolically stable adenosine analogue 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) did not affect the initial steps in the sequence from IgE-receptor activation to mediator release, which are generation of inositol trisphosphate and increase of cytosolic Ca2+. However, NECA did enhance the release induced in ATP-permeabilized cells by exogenous Ca2+, but it had no effect on the release induced by phorbol esters. These data suggest that adenosine sensitizes mediator release by a mechanism regulating stimulus-secretion coupling at a step distal to receptor activation and second-messenger generation.\r"

A monoclonal antibody that inhibits ETA enzymatic activity in vitro fails to react with ETA variants that have a His 426----Tyr substitution. Several mono-ADP-ribosylating toxins, including diphtheria and pertussis toxins, within the primary amino acid sequences carry a histidine residue that is conserved in spacing and in location with respect to other critical residues. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of ETA revealed that His-426 is not associated with the proposed NAD+ binding site. These findings should be useful for the design and construction of toxin vaccines.\r"

Quantitative in vivo binding curves show that O2 strengthens by approximately 3-fold repressor binding to O1 that is located 400 base pairs upstream at the transcription start site. The internal O2 sequence also contributes to repression by a second mechanism: repressor bound internally blocks elongation of beta-galactosidase gene expression. This secondary mechanism of repression is facilitated by the remote O1 operator that strengthens binding to O2 12-fold. Thus, lac repression involves two mechanisms, both of which involve cooperation between remote operator elements. During mild repression only the initiation mechanism applies, but more severe repression favors formation of the presumptive O1-O2 repression loop that allows both mechanisms to act simultaneously.\r"

Cells infected with this virus efficiently expressed the bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 and E5 genes. Expression of the E2 gene caused transactivation of genes linked to the bovine papillomavirus type 1 control region, resulting in up to a 1000-fold induction. At high multiplicity of infection of a cell line containing an integrated reporter gene, most cells were infected and responded to transactivation. Within 48 hr of infection with wild-type virus but not with an open reading frame E5 mutant, mouse C127 cells displayed dramatic changes in morphology and growth characteristics similar to those seen in tumorigenic transformation.

Concomitant with these morphological changes was the loss of the exogenous hc-Ha-rasT24 sequence. When cells were cultured without transfer, multiple clusters of flat revertant cells surrounded by transformed cells within single colonies of a1-1 cells were observed. This, together with the slow growth rate of flat cells in the presence of BA, indicated that flat revertants were induced rather than selected by BA. Flat cells isolated from mixed colonies completely lost the exogenous and amplified hc-Ha-rasT24 gene. In contrast, the endogenous mouse c-Ha-ras in flat revertant cells was not lost during culture with BA. Similarly, the endogenous hc-Ha-rasT24 in human bladder carcinoma T24 cells was not affected by BA. By using various chemicals, it was suggested that inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase induces an efficient and specific loss of the exogenous transforming genes including Ki-ras, N-ras, c-raf, and ret-II.\r"

Each of 29 chromosome rearrangement breakpoints in 16 gross aberrations detected in the Uc-derived X chromosomes had a hobo element. In one particular unstable X chromosome line selected for detailed studies, a hobo element was found in each of the five hot spots for rearrangements. Furthermore, hobo elements at deletion hot spots were found to lie in the same orientation, whereas those hobo elements at inversion hot spots were in the opposite orientation. The restriction maps of two phage lambda clones containing rearrangement breakpoints indicated that a hobo element was inserted exactly at the breakpoints. Pairing of hobo elements in the same chromosome followed by recombination between the paired hobo elements is suggested as the explanation for the intrachromosomal aberrations observed in the Uc X chromosomes. A clear qualitative difference among the hobo elements in their ability to participate in rearrangement formation was noted. It was also found that each of the 11 recessive lethal mutations mapped in the 6F1-2 doublet had a hobo element in the doublet, whereas none of the 16 independent revertants of the mutation had a hobo element in the site. This observation indicates that hobo movement is responsible for production and subsequent instability of recessive lethal mutations in the 6F region of the Uc X chromosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphokine gene expression was examined in a panel of 116 short-term murine T-lymphocyte clones derived by single-cell micromanipulation from allogeneic mixed leukocyte cultures. About 30% of clonable T cells, including both CD4+ CD8- and CD4- CD8+ cells, could be expanded for assay at an average of 22 days after cloning. By RNA blot-hybridization analysis, most clones (85-96%) expressed detectable granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and gamma interferon mRNAs, and 11% expressed interleukin 4 mRNA. Although no differences were noted between CD4+ and CD8+ clones in the combinations of lymphokines produced, CD4+ clones on average transcribed and secreted higher levels. When the frequencies of coexpression of any pair of lymphokine mRNAs were determined, all were found to correspond to the values predicted for random assortment of the individual frequencies. For example, among 13 interleukin 4-positive clones, 11 also transcribed gamma interferon, giving the frequency of double-positive clones expected for random association (9.6% versus 10.8%). Therefore, expression of the four lymphokine genes segregated independently among the clones and did not allow the division of T cells into subsets with distinct patterns of lymphokine synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of intravenous infusion of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor type alpha (rTNF-alpha; 12 micrograms/kg) on lung fluid balance in sheep prepared with chronic lung lymph fistulas. The role of neutrophils was examined in sheep made neutropenic with hydroxyurea (200 mg/kg for 4 or 5 days) before receiving rTNF-alpha. Infusion of rTNF-alpha resulted in respiratory distress and 3-fold increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance within 15 min, indicating intense pulmonary vasoconstriction. Pulmonary lymph flow (i.e., net transvascular fluid filtration rate) and transvascular protein clearance rate (a measure of vascular permeability to protein) increased 2-fold within 30 min. The increased permeability was associated with leukopenia and neutropenia. The pulmonary hypertension and vasoconstriction subsided but fluid filtration and vascular permeability continued to increase. Sheep made neutropenic had similar increases in pulmonary transvascular fluid filtration and vascular permeability. rTNF-alpha also produced concentration-dependent increases in permeability of 125I-labeled albumin across ovine endothelial cell monolayers in the absence of neutrophils or other inflammatory mediators. The results indicate that rTNF-alpha increases pulmonary vascular permeability to protein by an effect on the endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Human placenta is a readily available organ that responds to maternal environmental insult and has been previously used to investigate metabolism and bioactivation of procarcinogens, for example, benzo[a]pyrene. HPLC in combination with synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine 28 placentas for the presence of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-DNA adducts, and 10 of these were found to be positive. DNA samples from these placentas were subsequently pooled and subjected to partial enzymatic digestion to oligonucleotide fragments. Concentration of those DNA fragments containing benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-DNA adducts was achieved by immunoaffinity chromatography with polyclonal antibodies raised against these adducts. Column eluates were hydrolyzed under mild acid conditions and extracted with an organic solvent. The presence of benzo[a]pyrene-7,10/8,9-tetrahydrotetrol residues in the extracts was determined by HPLC and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and was confirmed by GC/MS. The results unequivocally confirm bioactivation and formation of DNA adducts from benzo[a]pyrene in human placenta in vivo and establish a methodological approach to direct measurement of carcinogen-DNA adducts that are formed as a result of human environmental exposure.\r"

To assess whether P210bcr/abl might transform hematopoietic cell types, retroviral constructs encoding P210bcr/abl were used to infect the bone marrow-derived interleukin 3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line. As for P160gag/v-abl, cell lines expressing P210bcr/abl were growth factor independent and tumorigenic in nude mice. No evidence for autocrine production of interleukin 3 by factor-independent cell lines was found.

This sequence alone can function as a tissue-specific enhancer for LPS-induced gene expression. A potent inhibitor of B lymphopoiesis [transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)] was used to explore the mechanisms in the activation of kappa transcription by LPS and by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). TGF-beta inhibited LPS-induced kappa transcription but not the activation and in vitro binding of NF-kappa B. This indicates that NF-kappa B activation, while necessary, is not sufficient for LPS-induced kappa transcription. TGF-beta had no effect on IFN-gamma-induced kappa transcription, and NF-kappa B was not activated by IFN-gamma. These results reveal that LPS and IFN-gamma activate transcription through different mechanisms.\r"

On reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, purified synaptophysin displays voltage-sensitive channel activity with an average conductance of about 150 picosiemens.

The median daytime arterial oxygen tension, measured before and after at least three months' treatment, increased from 6.2 (range 5.4-9.6) to 9.1 (7.1-9.8) kPa in those with restrictive disease (p less than 0.05), and from 6.0 (5.7-6.5) to 7.1 (6.3-7.7) kPa in the four with airflow limitation (NS). Median values for arterial carbon dioxide tension over the same time fell from 8.2 (range 6.7-9.8) to 6.5 (6.0-6.9) kPa in the group with restrictive disease (p less than 0.05) and from 8.2 (7.0-9.2) to 7.1 (4.9-7.7) kPa in those with airflow limitation (p less than 0.02). Total sleep time while patients were using nasal positive pressure ventilation varied from 155 to 379 (median 341) minutes, and included 4-26% rapid eye movement sleep (median 14%). The percentage of monitored time during the night in which the arterial oxygen saturation was less than 80% fell from a median (range) of 96 (3-100) to 4 (0-9) in the six patients with restrictive disease and from 100 (98-100) to 40 (2-51) in those with airflow limitation.

Fibronectin was significantly increased in the group with sarcoidosis and was found to be positively correlated with angiotensin converting enzyme activity, protein concentration, percentage of T cells and helper:suppressor ratios in the lavage fluid. Increased fibronectin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was not related to functional or radiographic indices of interstitial disease and did not identify patients subsequently requiring treatment. Latent collagenase was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 16 patients with sarcoidosis but not in any control sample. There was no association between the collagenase activity and the cell profiles of the lavage fluid. Yet carbon monoxide transfer factor was decreased in patients with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collagenase. Ten of 16 patients with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collagenase had radiographic class III or IV disease and a disease duration of more than two years. On follow up 62% of patients with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collagenase required subsequent treatment, compared with only 23% of patients without collagenase. These results indicate an association between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collagenase and progressive, prolonged disease in sarcoidosis, whereas increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid fibronectin is associated with indices of disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of pulmonary clearance of an inhaled aerosol of technetium-99m labelled diethylenetriaminepenta-acetate (DTPA) by external detection methods has been used widely as an index of permeability across alveolar epithelium and bronchial mucosa. To determine the applicability of the tracer to measurement of permeability in the airways the diffusion and binding characteristics of 99mTc DTPA and the chemically related ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid labelled with carbon-14 (14C EDTA) was studied in purified respiratory tract mucus glycoprotein from patients with chronic bronchitis. The diffusion coefficients for 99mTc DTPA and 14C EDTA through mucus gels were significantly lower than those for tritiated water. Both molecules bound to the mucus gels with high affinity at two independent low capacity sites. Appreciable amounts of 99mTc DTPA or 14C EDTA are therefore unlikely to cross mucus layers of physiological thickness over periods of four or five hours. This suggests that when pulmonary clearance is determined by the 99mTc DTPA method the tracer retained in mucus lined airways will provide background activity. This study supports the assumption that pulmonary clearance measurements are mainly measuring alveolar epithelial permeability and should not be used to study bronchial epithelial permeability.\r"

The antisera (n = 20) were tested against five examples each of RBCs from apparent homozygotes and heterozygotes. The flow cytometry method was clearly superior, showing distinct differences, with no overlap of the ranges of results, between the reactions of RBCs from homozygotes and heterozygotes with 10 of 20 (50%) antisera. By the manual titration technique none of these sera clearly demonstrated dosage and 15 showed overlap of the ranges. It was obvious from the results that the commonly used manual titration technique for comparing the test RBCs with a single example of RBCs from a homozygote and heterozygote yielded inaccurate results.\r"

The decay of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) in whole blood and plasma stored at 22 and 4 degrees C and the recovery of FVIII:C in cryoprecipitate and FVIII concentrate prepared from plasma separated from whole blood stored overnight at 4 degrees C were investigated. In whole blood stored at 22 degrees C and plasma stored at either 4 or 22 degrees C, 90 percent of the original FVIII:C was present at 6 hours, 80 percent at 12 hours, and 65 to 70 percent at 18 hours. At these times lower levels of FVIII:C were recovered from whole blood stored at 4 degrees C, that is, 84, 68, and 56 percent, respectively. In cryoprecipitates prepared from plasma separated from RBCs after 18 hours' storage at 4 degrees C (18-hour plasma), 43 percent of FVIII:C activity was recovered, as compared with 61 percent recovered from standard plasma separated within 6 hours of donation (6-hour plasma), p less than 0.05. With large-scale preparation of FVIII concentrates, however, the yield of FVIII:C was similar whether 18- or 6-hour plasma was used. Thus FVIII concentrates--but not cryoprecipitates--can be prepared from plasma separated from whole blood stored at 4 degrees C for up to 18 hours without undue loss of potency.\r"

  ".W": "The fiberoptic scope is increasingly used in the coronary and peripheral arteries to quantitate the degree and type of arterial obstructive disease and to inspect the results of procedures such as bypass grafting and laser irradiation of obstructive lesions. Since little is known about this instrument's potential complications, we passed a variety of fiberoptic scopes (1.8 to 3.6 mm outer diameter) in fresh postmortem pig coronary arteries and live monkey and canine peripheral arteries, and observed the intraluminal anatomy through the angioscope. No perforations were created, but ridges rising from the vascular luminal surface, avulsion of the endothelial lining, and small flaps attached at one end to the vessel wall were observed. Histologically, subintimal and medial tears were evident. Inserting large diameter scopes or making frequent passes (10 to 100) in coronary arteries increased intravascular injury. The use of small diameter flexible scopes or infrequent passes (less than 10) in the larger iliac and femoral arteries of live monkeys and dogs resulted in a lower frequency of myointimal sloughing or flap formation. Current fiberoptic scopes are not ideal angioscopes; they have a rigid tip, cannot be steered adequately, and are relatively stiff, resulting in a high probability of intraluminal injury, especially when used in small tortuous arteries. To decrease the risk of such injury, we recommend gentle manipulations while passing the scope and use of the smallest diameter scope possible. We further suggest limited use of the fiberscope, or at least limiting the number of passes in small vessels such as coronary arteries.\r"

These shortcomings are: (1) failure to lyse some thrombotic occlusions; (2) limited quantifiable salvage relative to risk area, possibly related to low magnitude or reperfusion coronary flow through a tight residual stenosis; (3) frequent early postlytic reocclusion and reinfarction; and (4) common postinfarction angina after lysis and some degree of salvage. Recently however, important controlled clinical trials of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after lytic therapy (most notably Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction study group, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial and the European Cooperative trial) have not confirmed this hypothesis. Very early PTCA after intravenous lytic therapy has not produced a favorable short-term outcome compared with delayed PTCA or a more conservative approach. Where is the flaw? Is it the hypothesis, the patient selection criteria or the specifics of therapeutic algorithms? While these issues are further investigated, current prudent clinical recommendations are best modified downward from enthusiastic rapid postlytic dilatation.\r"

During the control period the patients were on aluminum hydroxide and calcitriol therapy and had plasma phosphorus levels less than 6 mg/dL (4.95 +/- 0.8 mg/dL). Aluminum hydroxide was then discontinued and no phosphate binder was prescribed for 1 month. Every patient developed hyperphosphatemia so that calcium carbonate treatment was begun and calcitriol dose was adjusted in relation to plasma calcium changes. After 24 months of calcium carbonate therapy, plasma phosphorus was 4.85 +/- 0.7 mg/dL, using a daily dose of calcium carbonate of 2.57 +/- 1.3 g (range, 1 to 6 g). The daily dose per patient of calcitriol was not different from that prescribed during the control period, but in five patients calcitriol was permanently withdrawn for hypercalcemia. At the end of the study plasma calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone values were unchanged in comparison with the control period, whereas a significant reduction in plasma aluminum and plasma aluminum increase induced by deferoxamine infusion was observed. The frequency of hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic episodes during the last 12 months of calcium carbonate therapy (6.2% and 16.6%, respectively) was not different from that observed during the 12 months on aluminum hydroxide therapy preceding the control period (4.5% and 14.7%, respectively). It was concluded that calcium carbonate is effective in the control of hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on chronic hemodialysis and that the incidence of hypercalcemia is low when the daily dosage is less than 6 g.\r"

Currently 13 states are using DRG prospective \"all-payer systems\" for hospital reimbursement; other state may adopt DRG all payer systems. In DRG all-payer systems, Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other commercial insurers pay by the DRG mode; New York state has been all-payer since January 1, 1988. This study simulated DRG all-payer methods on a large sample (n = 558) of adult nephrology patients for a 2-year period using both federal and New York DRG reimbursements now in effect. Both Medicare and Medicaid patients had (on average) longer hospital lengths of stay and higher total hospital costs compared with patients from Blue Cross and other commercial payers. Medicare and Medicaid patients also had greater severity of illness than patients from Blue Cross or other payers. However, all payers (ie, Medicaid, Blue Cross, Medicare, and commercial insurers) generated significant financial risk under our DRG all-payer scheme. These data suggest that federal, state, and private payers may be underreimbursing for the care of hospitalized nephrology patients using the DRG prospective hospital payment scheme. As DRG payment rates are further reduced compared with the real hospital costs of treating patients, both the access to and the quality of care for many nephrology patients may be jeopardized.\r"

However, information regarding genetic variation at apolipoprotein loci is scanty, and the available data are largely restricted to Caucasian populations. Using recently developed isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting techniques, we have screened a large number of serum samples from Nigerian blacks to investigate structural variation at six apolipoprotein loci: A-I, A-II, A-IV, C-II, E, and H. With the exception of a single example of a putative APO A-I variant, the APO A-I and A-II loci were found to be monomorphic. Several new variants have been identified at the APO A-IV locus, which are apparently restricted to the black gene pool. By comparison with Caucasians, in whom APO C-II is invariant, four allelic variants have been identified in the Nigerians at the APO C-II structural locus. A common three-allele polymorphism has been observed for APO E, with a striking high frequency of the APO E*4 allele. In addition to three common alleles, the APO H locus is characterized by having an allele marker unique to blacks. The mean heterozygosity at these apolipoprotein loci is higher in Nigerian blacks as compared with the Caucasians.\r"

  ".W": "It is certainly acknowledged, albeit rather recently, that adequate control of hyperglycemia in type II diabetic patients is generally poor at best. A heightened realization of this fact and hopes that control of hyperglycemia may prevent complications or limit their severity have spawned newer approaches toward achieving improved glycemic control through changes in standard programmatic care with diet, exercise, oral agents or insulin therapy, and management of hypertension and obesity. Insulin taken at bedtime to control nocturnal hepatic glucose output, multiple doses of regular insulin coupled with frequent blood sugar measurements, and combined insulin and oral agents are approaches currently under trial in several centers. Interest in combination therapy stems in part from residual concern that hyperinsulinemia may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, and to evidence that the sulfonylureas, especially the second-generation drugs, improve sensitivity to the glycolytic effects of insulin, thereby reducing insulin resistance. More than a dozen serious studies of combined therapy have been reported since the early 1980s. This study is unique, however, in several respects since non-obese, type II, insulin-requiring diabetic persons were chosen for study and were hospitalized prior to initiating the actual investigation in order to secure optimal diabetic control and thereby ensure greater sensitivity of the beta cell. Twenty type II diabetic patients were studied in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with insulin and glyburide. All were treated with intermediate-acting insulin and adjustments were made as necessary to achieve optimal control, after which the patients were randomly assigned to either an insulin-and-glyburide program or to insulin-plus-placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were followed in an outpatient setting for four months, after which time they were rehospitalized for final assessment. Standard chemistries, urinary glucose, glycosylated hemoglobins, and urinary C-peptide levels were measured. The fasting serum glucose level remained normal in the glyburide/insulin-treated group, whereas these were significantly higher in the placebo-plus-insulin group at four and at eight weeks. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels rose progressively in the placebo- and insulin-treated group and by 16 weeks were significantly higher than measurements from the insulin- and glyburide-treated group of patients (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The glycogen synthase-mediated reaction is rate-limiting for glycogen synthesis in the liver. Glycogen synthase has been purified essentially to homogeneity and has been shown to be a dimer composed of identical subunits. It is regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism, catalyzed by kinases and a phosphatase. The subunits of synthase D, the most phosphorylated form, each contain approximately 17 phosphates. The subunits of synthase I, the least phosphorylated form, each contain 14 phosphates. Thus, during the transition between these two forms, a net of three phosphoryl groups is added or removed. In synthase D, six of the phosphates are alkali-labile. In synthase I, three of the phosphates are alkali-labile. Therefore, all of the phosphorylation sites important in the interconversion of these two forms are alkali-labile (attached to serine or threonine residues). In short-term experiments using isolated hepatocytes, [32P]phosphate was only incorporated into the alkali-labile sites and the phosphate in these sites was shown to turn over rapidly. Glucose addition, which is known to reduce the proportion of synthase in the D form when assayed kinetically, also reduced the [32P]phosphate content. Glucagon addition, which increases the proportion of synthase in the D form, increased it. These changes do not appear to be site-specific. Ingestion or administration of fructose, or galactose, as well as glucose, result in a shift in synthase equilibrium in favor of the less phosphorylated forms. Possible mechanisms by which synthase phosphatase activity may be increased after ingestion of glucose or fructose, and thus shift the equilibrium in favor of the less phosphorylated forms, are discussed. The mechanism by which galactose may stimulate the phosphatase reaction is completely unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Lack of third-party reimbursement is frequently cited as a cause of underutilization of partial hospitalization. The authors contacted a sample of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and public and private payers to obtain information about their payment policies. They conclude that in the private sector, reimbursement barriers are diminishing but that clinicians frequently must obtain an extracontractual agreement for coverage. Partial hospitalization is particularly attractive to HMOs and others that pay on a capitated basis and can strictly control utilization. A recent clarification of Medicare guidelines may facilitate reimbursement for hospital-based programs, but there remain significant disincentives under the Medicare statute for widespread utilization of partial hospitalization.\r"

T. cruzi specific IgM and subclasses of IgG antibodies were detected and reached peak levels at the same period of time. Lytic antibodies were detected 2 weeks before demonstration of parasitemia and of antibodies reacting in the ELISA and IFA tests. Western blots used to examine antigen recognition revealed a complex array of antigens of epimastigotes and amastigotes, but not of blood trypomastigotes, recognized by antibodies in the various serum samples. Most of the antigens recognized by antibodies were common to all 3 stages of T. cruzi, although a few were specific for each of the stages. Certain antigens were only recognized by antibodies in serum collected at distinct periods of time during the course of the infection. The pattern noted after immunoprecipitation of 125I labeled cell membrane surface antigens was simple. Antigens of molecular weight of 90, 72, 50, and 30 K were immunoprecipitated in higher quantities. Antibodies in serum collected early and late in the infection recognized similar antigens in epimastigotes of the infecting strain and in epimastigotes of 3 other strains of T. cruzi from widely separated geographic areas.\r"

Concomitantly, the sympathetic innervation of the heart auricular appendages and of the submandibular gland was studied by a glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence method for catecholamines. At day 34 of infection, the superior cervical ganglia of an additional group of control and infected animals were studied morphometrically through the determination of ganglion volume, total number, and nuclear diameter of the principal neurons. No amastigote pseudocyst could be detected inside the ganglia at any time during infection. Inflammatory reactions were very discrete or absent at day 13 of infection, but were clearly present at day 20 as periganglionitis (in all infected animals) or ganglionitis (in 62.5% of the infected animals). These reactions again became very discrete at day 34 of infection. None of the morphometric parameters analyzed were altered by Chagas' disease. Histochemical studies on the sympathetic innervation of the heart and submandibular gland showed disappearance or rarefaction of fluorescent nerve fibers, starting around the 13th day of infection. The involvement of sympathetic nerve terminals in Chagas' disease is a local phenomenon rather than a consequence of parasitism or destruction.\r"

Immediate and delayed type hypersensitivities were detected in uninfected mice sensitized by multiple injections of proteinase. In S. mansoni infected mice, immediate hypersensitivity reactions were seen at 6 and 8 weeks following infection, coincident with the increase in anti-proteinase IgE antibody. Histological sections of the injection site confirmed the presence of degranulating mast cells. In contrast, delayed type hypersensitivity could not be detected at any time during the course of the infection. In the murine model of acute infection, immediate hypersensitivity to the SMw32 proteinase was predictive of infection.\r"

Rats treated with trimetrexate (25 mg/kg/d) plus sulfamethoxazole (250 mg/kg/d) orally responded at least as well as rats treated with trimethoprim (50 mg/kg/d) plus sulfamethoxazole. Trimetrexate alone administered orally was ineffective in treating P. carinii infection, but subcutaneous (sc) trimetrexate (7 mg/kg/d) significantly decreased the intensity of infection compared to controls. Trimetrexate is a potent antifolate that may provide an effective alternative to pentamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treatment of P. carinii pneumonia in humans.\r"

Observed changes in cardiac output, renal blood flow, renin release, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion do not adequately explain the renal effects of PEEP. Altered release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which is natriuretic and diuretic, may complete this explanation. The following hypothesis was tested: a PEEP-induced decrease in transmural right atrial pressure decreases ANF release, and this mechanism mediates subsequent alterations in renal function. Seven female mongrel dogs were anesthetized with halothane and their lungs ventilated mechanically for three consecutive 40 min periods of 0 PEEP, 10 cmH2O PEEP, and 0 PEEP. Addition of 10 cmH2O PEEP during mechanical ventilation decreased right atrial dimension and transmural right atrial pressure while intracavitary right atrial pressure was increased. Urine output was significantly decreased during PEEP, as were absolute and fractional excretion of sodium and osmolar clearance. PEEP ventilation resulted in a consistent and significant decline in plasma ANF concentration (82 +/- 11 to 62 +/- 11 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). Hemodynamic parameters, renal function, and ANF concentration returned to control values after cessation of PEEP. A second series of experiments in five dogs demonstrated a close temporal relationship between changes in atrial dimension or atrial transmural pressure, plasma ANF concentration, and urine output or sodium excretion. The results of this study demonstrate that PEEP-induced decreases in atrial distension resulted in decreased ANF release, which may mediate, in part, the antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects of PEEP.\r"

Placebo or urapidil (60 mg orally thrice a day) was given during 48 h preceding each incremental maximal exercise testing. Urapidil compared to placebo consistently lowered the pulmonary artery pressure either at rest from 29 +/- 2.5 to 24 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) or during exercise from 55 +/- 3 to 46 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). At rest, the systemic arterial pressure was reduced from 97.5 +/- 4 to 88.5 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) with no significant difference in heart rate or cardiac index. During exercise, systemic arterial pressure decreased from 135 +/- 4 to 119 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). As compared to placebo, urapidil tended to increase the cardiac index from 6.1 +/- 0.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.4 L/min.m2 (NS) and to decrease heart rate, from 122 to 116 beats/min (NS); the resulting stroke volume index increased with urapidil from 49 +/- 3 to 57 +/- 4 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01); at rest, urapidil did not induce alteration in gas exchange, while during exercise, C(a-v)O2 decreased from 8.6 +/- 0.5 to 7.7 +/- 0.4 vol% (p less than 0.01), SVO2 increased from 39.5 +/- 2 to 44.5 +/- 1.5% (p less than 0.01), and SaO2 from 82 +/- 2 to 85 +/- 2% (p less than 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was tested for ability to inhibit virulent tubercle bacilli (TB) and virulent Mycobacterium avium in cultured human macrophages (MP). The first-line antituberculosis drug rifampin (RMP) also was tested against TB in MP. The drugs were added to the MP cultures immediately after infection or 2 days later. Antimicrobial inhibition was measured by colony-forming-unit (cfu) counts of bacilli from lysed samples of the infected MP taken at zero, 4, and 7 days after infection. Drug inhibition of the bacteria in vitro in 7H9 broth also was measured. OFL showed the same minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.25 micrograms/ml against TB in vitro and in MP. At 2 micrograms/ml or more it killed TB in vitro and in MP. It was equally effective in MP against initially nonmultiplying TB and MP-established TB, which were multiplying exponentially in the MP. OFL had the same MIC in vitro against M. avium but was ineffective against both M. avium in MP and M. avium isolated directly from MP at as much as 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC for RMP against TB in MP was 0.1 microgram/ml, and TB in vitro 0.02 microgram/ml. At 0.5 microgram/ml or greater, it killed TB in MP. RMP killed TB in MP rapidly, whereas OFL killed them slowly. These results confirm initial clinical evidence, as published by others, that OFL should be a useful antituberculosis drug. However, they suggest that it may not be very effective against MA infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE) has been attributed to decreased lung interstitial pressures from a variety of mechanisms. Because some recent studies have implicated mechanisms that increase microvascular permeability in RPE, we tested whether the edema were due to free radical generation during re-expansion and reoxygenation of the collapsed lung. We used a rabbit model of RPE to test the effects of intracellular (dimethylthiourea) or extracellular (catalase) oxygen metabolite scavengers. Allopurinol was administered separately to determine whether xanthine oxidase was an important source of superoxide in this model. Edema was quantitated both gravimetrically and histologically, and lung xanthine oxidase activity was measured using a sensitive fluorometric assay with pterin as substrate. The results suggest indirectly that OH. or H2O2 (derived from O2-) contribute to the well-documented increase in lung permeability in RPE because dimethylthiourea, dimethylthiourea plus catalase, or catalase alone inhibited the edema to various degrees. Further, we observed histologically that increased numbers of neutrophils were present in re-expanded lungs and that neutrophil infiltration appeared to be diminished by antioxidant administration. Allopurinol did not decrease the edema, because xanthine oxidase activity in rabbit lung tissue is extremely low. We speculate that free radical generation in lung tissue contributes to the pathogenesis of RPE, although reinitiation of lung perfusion and ventilation requires a rapid change in intrathoracic pressure.\r"

Patients with a greater number of complicating conditions (CCs) had higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, more procedures per patient, increasing financial risk under DRGs, a larger number of outliers, and a higher mortality than did patients in these same DRGs with a fewer number of CCs. These findings raise the question of the equity of DRG reimbursement at our hospital vis-a-vis the non-CC-stratified pulmonary medicine DRGs. If these findings are generalizable at other teaching hospitals, the current DRG system may provide financial incentives to not treat certain types of pulmonary medicine patients likely to have many CCs, and potentially effect these patient's access and quality of care in the future.\r"

For comparison, 18 control subjects and 7 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis were also studied. Recovered BAL cells were cultured for 24 h (5 x 10(6)/ml), and the supernatant was assayed for interferon by determining inhibition of cytopathic effect on encephalomyocarditis virus-induced lysis of WISH cells and characterized by monoclonal anti-IFN gamma antibody inhibition. Nine (35%) patients with asbestosis released increased amounts of IFN gamma, up to 320 units/ml, the levels seen in the sarcoidosis patients. All control subjects released less than or equal to 10 units/ml. All interferon released was IFN gamma. In asbestosis patients, IFN gamma production was not related to a history of cigarette smoking, there was no significant difference in the ratio of helper/inducer (Leu-3) to suppressor/cytotoxic (Leu-2) cells in IFN gamma producers compared to non-IFN gamma producers (p greater than 0.05), and IFN gamma production correlated significantly with serum IgG levels (p less than 0.001) but not with the levels of IgM, IgA, antinuclear factor, or rheumatoid factor. These data suggest that active cellular immune processes are present in the lungs of a proportion of patients with asbestosis.\r"

Patients with resting PH differed from the others by a lower daytime PaO2 (60.8 +/- 7.6 versus 76.2 +/- 9.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), a higher daytime PaCO2 (44.6 +/- 4.2 versus 38.0 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), and lower VC and FEV1 (p less than 0.001). There was no difference between the 2 groups with regard to apnea index (62 +/- 34 versus 65 +/- 40) or the lowest sleep SaO2 (59 +/- 21 versus 66 +/- 18%) or the time spent in apnea. For the group as a whole, there was a good correlation between Ppa and daytime PaO2 (r = -0.61; p less than 0.001), PaCO2 (r = 0.55; p less than 0.001), and FEV1 (r = -0.52; p less than 0.001), but there was no significant correlation between Ppa and the apnea index, the lowest sleep SaO2, or the time spent in apnea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The PAP/Q plots were rectilinear in all experimental conditions. In control dogs (n = 8), PAP was increased over the entire range of Q studied, from 1 to 4 L/min.m2, 90 min after oleic acid 0.09 ml/kg, and remained so during 2 consecutive 5-point PAP/Q plots, each of them being constructed in about 30 min. Oleic acid increased the extrapolated pressure intercept (p less than 0.001) but not the slope of the PAP/Q plots. Infusion of PGE1 0.4 micrograms/kg.min intravenously (n = 8) reduced PAP at each level of Q, with a reduction of the extrapolated pressure intercept (p less than 0.01) and no change in slope of the PAP/Q plots. In contrast, NP 5 micrograms/kg.min intravenously (n = 8) slightly reduced PAP only at the highest Q studied, without any significant change in extrapolated pressure intercept or slope of PAP/Q plots. Systemic blood pressure was decreased by 21% after PGE1 and by 24% after NP. Neither drug affected Q nor blood gases after oleic acid. The results suggest that pulmonary hypertension secondary to oleic acid pulmonary edema may be due more to an increase in effective outflow pressure of the pulmonary circulation than to an increase in incremental vascular resistance, and that active vasoconstriction contributes to this type of pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Levels of prostaglandin (PG) I2 (as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha), thromboxane A2 (TXA2) as TXB2, and PGF2 alpha but not levels of PGE2 were elevated. Levels of TXA2 were similar between dog and rabbit lungs but levels of PGI2 and PGF2 alpha were higher in dog than in rabbit lungs. However, this difference was not the same at all levels of TXA2. At lower levels of TXA2, the differences were greater and narrowed at higher levels of TXA2. This led to an overlap in the ratios of PGI2/TXA2 and PGF2 alpha/TXA2 between dog and rabbit lungs. We conclude that species differences exist in formation of cyclooxygenase products between dog and rabbit lungs. With respect to products, differences may be dependent on the level of products in response to an AA-releasing agent. This suggests that rabbit lungs can be more sensitive than dog lungs to formation of relatively greater amounts of TXA2. However, the ratios of PGI2/TXA2 and PGF2 alpha/TXA2 can be similar between these species as follows: (1) if there is a sufficient dose of AA-releasing stimulus, or (2) if there is a sufficient difference in doses of the stimulus, with the lower dose being applied to rabbit lungs. Speculatively, physiologic effects of cyclooxygenase products may be similar under these conditions despite the species differences.\r"

Mean values +/- SEM in ng EB/mg wet weight tissue for unsensitized versus sensitized animals were: trachea, 23.6 +/- 6.6 versus 92.5 +/- 11.1; main bronchi, 31.1 +/- 12.2 versus 153.1 +/- 14.9; \"central\" intrapulmonary airways (ipa), 34.6 +/- 11.2 versus 101.3 +/- 6.2; and \"peripheral\" ipa, 26.2 +/- 6.8 versus 93.5 +/- 13.6. We investigated the involvement of several mediators of inflammation in this process. FPL 55712, a sulfidopeptide leukotriene receptor antagonist, caused significant inhibition of leakage in trachea (to 55.1 +/- 9.8) and main bronchi (91.7 +/- 15.8). Blockade of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways with BW 755C, but not of the cyclooxygenase pathway alone with indomethacin, also significantly reduced EB dye extravasation in trachea (55.1 +/- 18.0), main bronchi (71.7 +/- 23.0), and \"central\" ipa (62.7 +/- 16.4). The histamine antagonists, chlorpheniramine and cimetidine, only inhibited microvascular leakage in main bronchi (94.4 +/- 20.0). PAF-receptor blockade with the ginkgolide mixture BN 52063 had no effect. Nedocromil sodium, a mast cell stabilizer and an inhibitor of inflammatory cell activation, caused significant inhibition throughout the airways: trachea, 50.4 +/- 10.6; main bronchi, 72.0 +/- 15.3; \"central\" ipa 61.0 +/- 8.6; \"peripheral\" ipa 41.9 +/- 12.2. Thus, histamine and lipoxygenase products (in particular, leukotrienes), but not PAF, may mediate the antigen-induced increase in vascular permeability to different degrees in differing regions of the respiratory tract in guinea pigs.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we present a new concept of the role of the basal cell in airway epithelium. Previously, the basal cell was thought to be the progenitor cell for the columnar epithelium. However, several studies have shown that this concept may not be correct. The morphologic aspects of the basal cell suggest that it could play a role in adhesion of the columnar epithelium to the basement membrane. Basal cells form attachments with columnar cells (desmosomes) and with the basement membrane (hemidesmosomes). Columnar cells do not form hemidesmosome attachments with the basement membrane. Basal cells could strengthen the adhesion of columnar cells to the basement membrane by forming hemidesmosome attachments to the basement membrane and desmosome attachments with adjacent columnar cells. Incidental evidence from 2 existing publications concerning airway microanatomy support this concept. As columnar cells grow taller, the proportion of the cell surface in contact with the basement membrane becomes progressively smaller, and thus the cell surface area related to adhesion also becomes smaller. It was found that the number of basal cells per millimeter of basement membrane was closely related to the height of the columnar cell epithelium (r = 0.98), but not to the number of columnar cells (r = 0.42). The consistency of the relationship between increased columnar cell height (and thus decreased surface area for adhesion) and the number of basal cells present (r = 0.98) supports the concept that the basal cell plays a role in adhesion of columnar cells to the basement membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an attempt to decrease reperfusion injury, we gave the oxygen-derived free radical scavengers allopurinol, superoxide dismutase, or mannitol during reperfusion of canine gracilis muscle made ischemic for 4 hours. We measured muscle O2 consumption (MVO2), and tissue calcium, water, and adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) before ischemia, after ischemia, and at 5 minutes and 60 minutes of reperfusion. The results at 60 minutes showed no improvement in MVO2 or ATP. In fact, ATP was significantly depressed with allopurinol and superoxide dismutase treatment, and tissue edema did not decrease in any of the groups. We conclude that the simple addition of oxygen-derived free radical scavengers during the initial reperfusion of totally ischemic skeletal muscle does not attenuate reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-four clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center appeared resistant to ticarcillin-potassium clavulanate in agar dilution and broth macrodilution tests. Among those isolates producing a single non-class I beta-lactamase, resistance was due to production of high levels of TEM-1, SHV-1, or class IV enzymes. In five Escherichia coli isolates, production of low levels of PSE-1 was responsible for resistance which seemed due to rapid hydrolysis of ticarcillin rather than diminished susceptibility of PSE-1 to inhibition by potassium clavulanate. Comparisons of dilution and disk diffusion tests revealed major discrepancies, with 65% false susceptibility in the disk test. Revision of the interpretive criteria used for disk diffusion tests from less than or equal to 11 to less than or equal to 18 mm for resistance is proposed to resolve these discrepancies until clinical data are obtained which can be used to determine which in vitro test is most predictive of therapeutic outcome. These new criteria would diminish false susceptibility without introducing false resistance.\r"

Titres of class specific antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and class specific antibodies to Ps aeruginosa in circulating immune complexes, were also measured. According to the Shwachman score the patients were divided into three clinical groups: group 1-moderate and severe disease, group 2-mild disease, and group 3-well. The results of the immunological investigations were correlated with the clinical state of the patients as assessed by the Shwachman score. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were inversely correlated with the Shwachman score, but the differences between the groups were only significant for IgG and IgA. The same correlations were found for circulating immune complexes containing IgG and IgA. Antibodies to Ps aeruginosa could be detected in most of the patients' serum samples. IgA antibody specific to Ps aeruginosa was the most often raised, even in patients in group 3. It is therefore suggested that IgA antibody specific to Ps aeruginosa could be an early marker of colonisation by Ps aeruginosa and a sensitive measurement of infection with Ps aeruginosa in young children with cystic fibrosis. Moreover, in the circulating immune complexes, class specific antibodies to Ps aeruginosa were found in nearly half the patients. The highest titres of IgG and IgA antibodies specific to Ps aeruginosa in the circulating immune complexes were detected in the patients with the worst clinical state (group 1).\r"

Pilot exposure assessment studies were conducted at 12 sites where risks of human exposure were thought to be greatest. Serum PCB levels in persons at highest risk of nonoccupationally related exposures (because of their self-reported frequencies and types of activities in contaminated areas) at 10 sites were within background ranges, even though environmental contamination levels as high as 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) in monitoring well water samples and 330,000 ppb in soil samples were measured. At the 2 remaining sites, elevated serum levels were found in these high-risk persons, which require further evaluation by community surveys. These results illustrate that, despite elevated environmental contaminant levels, unless uptake of chemicals above background exposure levels can be demonstrated, adverse health effects cannot be attributed to waste site chemicals. However, health risks due to background exposure levels, as well as in populations with elevated PCB body burdens need further study.\r"

Synthesis rates of secreted proteins in perfused liver were similar in the different treatment groups in the 18-hour experiments, whereas in the 48-hour experiments, synthesis rates of total secreted proteins, C3, and the serumucoid fraction were higher in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3. The results suggest that administration of an amino acid solution improves nitrogen balance in sepsis, but that this effect is not caused by stimulated hepatic protein synthesis. The nitrogen-sparing effect during sepsis of a branched chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched solution does not seem to be superior to that of a balanced amino acid solution.\r"

In Group I (N = 6), donor organs procured following core cooling to 15 degrees C on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with cardioplegic arrest were immediately transplanted. In Group II (N = 6), following cardioplegic arrest without CPB core-cooling, the pulmonary artery was flushed with modified Collins' solution. Heart-lung blocks were immersed in extracellular solution for 6 hours and then transplanted. In Groups III and IV (N = 6 each), following CPB core-cooling to 15 degrees C and cardioplegic arrest, the organ blocks were immersed in extracellular solution (Group III) and the heart was perfused with oxygenated extracellular solution (Group IV). Evaluation of lung function using differences in arterial oxygen tension between the left and right atria demonstrated no differences between groups. However, extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular resistance were significantly elevated in Group II. Cardiac function assessed by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to end-systolic dimension was significantly better in Group IV than in Groups II and III. Thus, adequate 6-hour hypothermic cardiopulmonary preservation with core cooling plus heart perfusion can be achieved for heart-lung transplantation.\r"

The total sample consisted of 103 adults (mean age, 69 years) undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected aortic stenosis. Twenty-six patients (25%) were used as a training set to develop a clinical prediction rule. (1) If maximum aortic jet velocity (Vmax) was more than 4.0 m/s, AVR was recommended. (2) If Vmax was less than 3.0 m/s, AVR was not needed. (3) If Vmax was 3.0 to 4.0 m/s and (a) Doppler aortic valve area (AVA) was 1.0 cm2 or less, AVR was recommended, while (b) if Doppler AVA was 1.7 cm2 or greater, AVR was not needed, and (c) if Doppler AVA was 1.1 to 1.6 cm2, consideration of the degree of coexisting aortic insufficiency was necessary. When this rule was applied to the test set (n = 77), the sensitivity was 98%, with a specificity of 89% and a total error rate of 3.9%. The approach could have resulted in cost savings between 24% and 34% compared with an invasive diagnostic approach.\r"

In contrast, gamma-IFN inhibited proliferation and stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells, while inhibiting 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated osteocalcin production and having variable effects on the release of prostaglandins, depending on the presence of other factors. Our results suggest that TNF and gamma-IFN can act directly on bone-forming cells to affect both their proliferation and their differentiated function, and that changes in the ability of cells to produce these factors in disease states may contribute to alterations in the integrity of connective tissue matrices.\r"

It has been previously demonstrated that an interdialytic weight gain of 3 kilograms requires the removal of 3 liters, mostly of extracellular fluid, which may contain 60-70 mMols of bicarbonate. Such losses require an increase in the buffer mass transfer to achieve a good buffer balance. The importance of interdialytic weight gain (IWG) on acid-base status was evaluated in two significantly different periods. In the period where the IWG was lower, predialytic pH and HCO3 were significantly higher than in the alternate period. Since dialysis schedule, dialysate buffer, daily protein intake and given medications did not differ during the two periods, we conclude that a reduced ultrafiltration due to less weight gain betters predialytic acid-base status.\r"

They were grafted intraperitoneally with permselective hollow fibers seeded with human insulinoma (n = 6), rodent insulinoma (n = 6), or human islets (n = 6). Controls were 15 nontreated diabetic females and 10 nondiabetic male NOD mice implanted with nonseeded macrocapsules. Electron microscopy (rectangular crystalline nucleoids characteristic of B-cells), in vitro release of insulin (during abrupt changes in glucose concentration from 40 to 400 mg/dl and return, M +/- SD insulin levels were 122 +/- 5 uu/ml and 315 +/- 17 at low and high glucose), evidence of binding hormone receptors (VIP and GIP, the binding sites being coupled with adenylyl cyclase stimulation) were used to assess the quality of the transplant. Survival was always prolonged in grafted animals. Taking complete and long-term (less than 3 months) correction of hyperglycemia as the criterion, the success rate was about 50% as observed in streptozotocin rats. Splenocytes isolated from cured and not cured recipients and injected into irradiated nondiabetic male NOD mice were always able to transfer the disease. Our bioartificial pancreas is efficient in preventing the recurrence of the disease in autoimmune diabetes.\r"

In five TAH goats that survived for 51-171 days, changes in hemodynamic parameters, plasma levels of renin, angiotensin I and II, aldosterone (p-RAA), and p-ANP were measured, and correlations between p-ANP and other parameters were studied, and histologic study of ANP and assay of the ANP content in atrial tissue was undertaken. Generally, p-ANP of TAH goats fell temporarily after surgery but then recovered to preoperative levels. Histopathologic studies of atrial tissue and ANP granules proved almost normal, although the coronary blood supply was occluded for more than 170 days; the ANP content in the atrium did not show significant changes after 51 days of TAH pumping. In one case prominent correlations between p-ANP and p-RAA were observed, and in another case significant correlation between p-ANP and arterial pressure was observed. However, these correlations were not observed in every case. In TAH goats the plasma ANP level did not increase in spite of high atrial pressures. Plasma ANP levels in TAH animals are almost normal. In TAH animals no role in the pathogenesis of hemodynamic abnormalities is played by abnormality of plasma ANP levels. However, TAH animals may display an abnormality in sensitivity to the p-ANP.\r"

Cardiac output, stroke volume, and thoracic fluid index (TFI) were measured by transthoracic impedence cardiography. Left cardiac work index (LCWI) was derived using these hemodynamic and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements. MAP was lower following dialysis when compared to pure ultrafiltration of a similar fluid loss. LCWI decreased during both dialysis and ultrafiltration. TFI, which is inversely related to intrathoracic fluid, increased following dialysis and ultrafiltration. ANP levels fell following fluid removal but remained elevated above normal control levels. The authors conclude that ANP levels are related to fluid not cardiac status in dialysis patients and that impedence cardiography is of value in determining hemodynamic and fluid changes during dialysis.\r"

Fifteen minutes after the start of cuprophan dialysis, 14CO2 production per 10(3) phagocytes increased more than four-fold (from 77.6 +/- 30.2 to 315.0 +/- 69.6 DPM/10(3) phagocytes; P less than 0.01). Such a change was absent during dialysis with membranes containing polysulphone, AN69S or reused cuprophan. In vitro contact of normal blood with cuprophan membranes revealed an increase of 14CO2-production by a maximum of 9.0 +/- 3.4 X 10(3) D.P.M. at 15 min. (P less than 0.05). Such an increase was absent after contact with polysulphone. The measurement of 14CO2 production during glucose metabolism, by phagocytes present in micro-amounts of whole blood, is a valuable test for membrane biocompatibility. Cuprophan dialysis induces a challenge of phagocytic activity that is absent for dialysers containing other membranes.\r"

In the qualitative study, antigenicity of type I collagen in bovine arteries treated with GA or glycerol polyglycidyl ether (GPE), a kind of PC, was detected using a fluorescent antibody technique. To evaluate the immunogenicity quantitatively, DDY mice were twice immunized with homogenates of GA, GPE, or untreated dog arteries. Using their sera collected 10 and 90 days after the last immunization as primary antibodies, the dogs' peripheral lymphocytes were stained with FITC labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies against shared antigens on arteries and lymphocytes. Percentages of stained lymphocytes were then analyzed with flow cytofluorometry. In both qualitative and quantitative studies, extremely low antigenicity and immunogenicity were shown in GA or GPE treated arteries. It is therefore suggested that GPE is an ideal cross-linking reagent for vascular and valvular xenografts and is applicable to clinical use.\r"

During the experiment, the test chamber was placed on a rotator to prevent settling of bacteria. At the end of the experiment, each test well was rinsed repeatedly to remove non-adherent bacteria. The number of bacteria adherent to the test surfaces was quantitated by a combination of methods including microscopic counting of cells, scintillation counting and autoradiography. It was noted that a greater number of bacteria adhered to surfaces coated with fibrinogen or fibronectin whereas surfaces treated with serum showed reduced bacterial adhesion. The inhibitory effect of serum appeared more pronounced with S. epidermidis when compared with P. aeruginosa under identical experimental conditions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that adherent bacteria were randomly distributed on the test surfaces and appeared to replicate while still adherent. These observations suggested that bacterial adhesion to biomaterials can be significantly influenced by the composition of the adsorbed proteins at the interface.\r"

It is hemostatic at the anastomotic site and has an affinity for endothelial-like cells, smooth musclelike cells, and fibroblasts. Fresh carotid artery with an ID of 2.5 to 3.0 mm was obtained from a dog and sonicated to induce destruction of the cell components. It was then cross-linked with a hydrophilic polyepoxy compound. As controls, glutaraldehyde (GA) treated grafts were prepared. Twenty-one dogs were used, 14 for the new graft and the other 7 as controls. A segment of the graft, 6 cm in length, was implanted into the carotid artery. Sodium heparin was given during surgery, but no anticoagulant was used thereafter. The compliance of the new graft was similar to that of the native artery. No excessive bleeding was noticed at the anastomotic sites. The patency rate was 70.8% during the longest observation period of 145 days, but was only 10% in the controls. Microscopic observation revealed that by the seventh day after implantation, endothelial-like cells had appeared near the anastomotic lines on the inner surface of the new graft; smooth musclelike cells were observed on the 38th day after implantation. From these results, there is a good possibility that this new graft, with its many advantages, may be used clinically.\r"

During the 4 week experiment, the ANP levels in the SAH goats increased to 516 pg/ml from the control value of 61.8 pg/ml because of an elevated CVP of 13-21 mmHg, while those of the LVAD goats were near the lower limit of the control values. The TAH calves had slightly decreased ANP levels at 23-46 pg/ml after the third postoperative week, which did not increase after the steep increase in CVP induced by the changes in the driving conditions. The PRA levels were 10-50 times higher than control in the SAH goats and a TAH calf whose CVP rose to 19 mmHg, although the cardiac output was within normal limits. In conclusion: 1) The secretion of ANP secondary to alteration in CVP was preserved in the LVAD recipients and enhanced diuresis, while it was compromised in the TAH cases. 2) The PRA levels in cases with elevated CVPs were high enough to suppress diuresis.\r"

In the circulatory subsystem, diastolic pressure was held at 70 to 100 mmHg by computer aided peripheral resistance, and a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) could be added when cardiac function was weakened. The respiratory subsystem was composed of an artificial lung and computer aided gas mixer for O2, CO2, and air, which kept blood PO2 and PCO2 within physiologic levels. In the metabolic subsystem, glucose and insulin were injected by infusion pump so as to maintain blood sugar within 100 to 200 mg/dl, whereas the environmental system preserved the isolated heart at 37 degrees C in a sterile water bath. Goats' hearts were connected to this system, and continued to beat for a maximum of 24 hours.\r"

AP activity of fresh and glutaraldehyde (GLUT) treated bovine pericardium was measured by the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol. After 24 hrs in 0.6% HEPES buffered GLUT and storage for 2 weeks in 0.2% GLUT, considerable AP hydrolytic activity remained relative to that of fresh tissue (Vmax: 24 vs 45 microM reaction product/min/mg tissue protein, respectively), although binding was moderately reduced (KM: 1900 vs 1400 microM substrate, respectively). Light microscopic histochemistry suggested cell oriented AP activity. Ultrastructural examination of GLUT treated tissue demonstrated reaction product along membranes of vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, the sites of early calcific deposits in bioprosthetic valves. Thus, AP hydrolytic activity is largely preserved following GLUT treatment of bovine pericardium. These results indicate that the widely held view that GLUT eliminates all metabolic activities of bioprosthetic tissue is inaccurate and suggests that examination of the role of AP and other phosphatases may stimulate approaches for inhibiting calcification.\r"

  ".W": "Calcification (CALC) is the most frequent cause of the clinical failure of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs). Controlled release of disodium ethanehydroxydiphosphonate (EHDP) has been demonstrated to inhibit subdermal BHV calcification at effective low local doses, avoiding adverse effects. However, the eventual circulatory use of controlled release EHDP necessitates addressing several critical issues that may affect efficacy. These include the effects of sterilization on EHDP release and the efficacy of sustained release matrices containing CaEHDP, which is less soluble than NaEHDP. The effects of CaEHDP-NaEHDP incorporation and steam sterilization on controlled release of EHDP from silicone-rubber matrices was studied both in vitro and in vivo using a rat subdermal model and sheep tricuspid valve replacements. Autoclaved EHDP matrices (20% wt/wt) released 88.9% +/- 7.84 of contained drug after 140 days in vitro, compared with control (87.6% +/- 10.3 cumulative release). Autoclaved EHDP matrices completely inhibited BHV CALC in 60 day rat subdermal implants (8.84 +/- 3.68 micrograms Ca++/mg tissue), comparable to nonsterilized EHDP-loaded matrices (7.06 +/- 2.00 micrograms Ca++/mg tissue). Nontreated CALC levels were 183 +/- 7.60 micrograms Ca++/mg tissue. Na-CaEHDP co-incorporation into silicone rubber matrices markedly prolonged controlled release with the 1:1 Na-CaEHDP mixture demonstrating an extrapolated release duration of approximately 20 years, assuming the total amount of dispersed drug was released. Data from tricuspid valve replacements in sheep demonstrate erratic control calcification (41.3 +/- 14.9 micrograms Ca++/mg tissue), but complete suppression of BHV calcification with Na2EHDP controlled release (5.74 +/- 1.35 micrograms Ca++/mg tissue) after 150 days.\r"

This study was designed to assess the individual anticalcification effects of the trivalent cation, aluminum (AI ), and the compound aminopropanehydroxydiphosphonate (APDP) when used to pretreat aortic wall homograft tissue before subdermal implantation in the rat model. Thoracic aortas of male rats (CD, Sprague-Dawley, 350 to 400 g) were harvested distal to the aortic valve and incubated in the following solutions: 1) APDP (0.004 M), 2) APDP (0.004 M) + glutaraldehyde (GLUT) (0.02 M), 3) GLUT (0.02 M), 4) ALCL3 (0.01 M), 5) HCL (0.001 M), and 6) HEPES (0.05 M). The homograft tissue was then implanted subcutaneously for 21 days in weanling male rats (50 to 60 gm) of the same strain.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that preincubation of glutaraldehyde pretreated pericardial BPV leaflets in a solution containing the trivalent cation, AL , inhibits BPV calcification. BPV tissue was preincubated in 0.1 M ALCL3 for 24 hours (T = 25 degrees C), then subdermally implanted in rats (weanling, male, CD, Sprague-Dawley) for 21 days. Compared to the control group (tissue Ca++ = 143.81 +/- 25.49 micrograms/mg), calcification was markedly inhibited in the group pretreated with AL (tissue Ca++ = 4.1 +/- 1.03 micrograms/mg) after a 21 day implant. No adverse effects on rat growth or bone morphology were detected. It is concluded that the trivalent cation AL provided a marked anticalcification effect for BPV tissue implanted subdermally in the rat for 21 days.\r"

  ".W": "Monocyte-derived lipid-containing macrophages (MDLMs) constitutively synthesize a granulomonopoietic enhancing activity (GM-EA) that potentiates the function of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA). In the study reported, we show that GM-EA is distinct from interleukin-1 (IL-1) in biochemical and functional properties and that its production is negatively regulated by several mediators. Thus, MDLM cultures pretreated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, 3 to 900 U/mL), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 10(-13) to 10(-8) mol/L), or lactoferrin (LF, 10(-13) to 10(-8) mol/L) invariably produced less GM-EA than untreated controls. The relative potency of inhibition was in the order of IFN-gamma greater than or equal to PGE2 greater than LF. The extent of the inhibitory effects was proportional to dosage and the duration of treatment and could be observed following only a brief exposure (two hours) of the MDLMS to physiologic doses of the mediators. Under optimal conditions, IFN-gamma (300 U/mL for 24 to 48 hours) and PGE2 (10(-9) mol/L for 24 to 48 hours) could totally abrogate the ability of the MDLMs to produce GM-EA. However, the drug-inhibited MDLMs could be reactivated to produce GM-EA by treatment with zymosan (60 micrograms/mL). These results demonstrate that a mechanism for the control of myelopoiesis by mediators such as IFN-gamma, PGE2, and LF may involve the inhibition of GM-EA production. Furthermore, this negative feedback control is reversible and can be overridden when a proper stimulatory signal is given.\r"

This was documented functionally, with clotting assays measuring tissue factor inhibition and factor Xa inhibition, as well as immunologically, in a competitive immunoassay. The total amount of LACI released by 3 x 10(8) platelets after two hours stimulation was 7% to 8% of the amount found in 1 mL of serum. Half of the LACI was released by five minutes. The LACI was present in the platelet supernatant and was not associated with the platelet membrane or shed vesicles. The tissue factor and factor Xa inhibitory activities that were released were neutralized by preincubating the platelet supernatants with specific rabbit polyclonal anti-LACI IgG. On Western blot, platelet LACI appeared to run as a doublet with a molecular weight (mol wt) 45,000 to 47,000. Blood samples obtained from the site of a wound (template bleeding time) demonstrated a progressive increase in LACI concentration. A cDNA probe, derived from endothelial cell LACI cDNA, hybridized selectively to 4.0 and 1.4 kb transcripts in a preparation of platelet mRNA.\r"

The presence of bcr exon 3 in the mRNA was determined from the size of the amplified sequence; it was present in 14 and absent in seven patients. One leukemic cell per 1,000 nonleukemic cells could be readily detected, thus indicating the great sensitivity of the method.

In contrast to this, in Ph chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL), a P190bcr-abl can be observed. This P190bcr-abl has been implicated in acute rather than chronic leukemogenesis. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the transition from chronic to blast phase in CML is accompanied by an alternative splice in the bcr-abl mRNA, which results in a switch of the production of P210bcr-abl into P190bcr-abl. Initial S1 nuclease protection mapping supported this theory. However, this result appears to be based on an artifact in the S1 analysis. By using the polymerase chain reaction we provide evidence for the absence of alternative splicing in bcr-abl mRNA in two CML blast crisis cell lines.\r"

It requires more skill than imaging and may also be time consuming. Colour flow Doppler mapping is speedy and simple to use and aids the interpretation of continuous wave Doppler. It is therefore a natural companion to conventional Doppler, but there would have to be a high clinical load to justify its purchase.\r"

DESIGN--Exclusion of patients dying before fit enough to enter trial, those with pathological fractures, those likely to be discharged within seven days of entering the trial, and those remaining unfit for transfer to a peripheral hospital. Remainder allocated to two groups: treatment group and control group. SETTING--District hospital acute admission ward and rehabilitation ward. PATIENTS--144 sequentially admitted elderly women with proximal fracture of the femur; 36 excluded on above criteria and remainder entered into trial. INTERVENTION--Both treatment and control groups (n = 54 in each) received physiotherapy and other services. The treatment group also received thrice weekly supervision by a geriatrician. END POINTS--Physical independence, residence after discharge, and length of hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--At discharge significantly more patients in treatment group were independent in terms of activities of daily living than controls (41 v 25) and their median stay was 24 days (range 8-197) compared with 41 (9-365) (95% confidence intervals for difference 2 to 25). Significantly fewer treatment patients were discharged to institutional care (10% v 32%; 95% confidence interval for difference 6% to 37%) and more to their own homes (63% v 38%; 95% confidence interval for difference 6% to 44%). These beneficial effects were consistent across a range of ages and mental state. CONCLUSIONS--Both hospital and patient benefited when postoperative rehabilitation was provided in a setting specialising in such care for elderly patients with trauma.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised follow up study of normotensive diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 hours) treated with enalapril or its matched placebo for one year. Double blind for first six months, single blind for last six months. SETTING--Diabetic clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--Treatment group and placebo group each comprised 10 normotensive diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. INTERVENTIONS--Treatment group was given enalapril 20 mg daily and controls matched placebo. Patients were given antihypertensive treatment after one year. END POINT--Albumin excretion, arterial pressure, and renal function. MAIN RESULTS--In last three months of trial three of 10 patients taking placebo had diabetic nephropathy (albumin excretion greater than 300 mg/24 hours). No patients taking enalapril developed nephropathy and five showed normal albumin excretion (less than 30 mg/24 hours) (p = 0.005, Mann-Whitney test). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by enalapril throughout study (p less than 0.005) but increased linearly with placebo (p less than 0.05). Albumin excretion decreased linearly with enalapril but not placebo. An increase in albumin excretion with placebo was positively related to the increase in mean arterial pressure (r = 0.709, p less than 0.05, Spearman's rank test). With enalapril total renal resistances and fractional albumin clearances improved progressively (time effect, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION--Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme prevents development of nephropathy in normotensive diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. This may be due to reduction in intraglomerular pressure and to prevention of increased systemic blood pressure. Future studies should compare long term effects of inhibitors of converting enzyme with other antihypertensive drugs.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there is a short term increase in the risk of breast cancer after a full term birth data from two hospital based, case-control studies in Italy were pooled. Analysis was restricted to women aged under 50 with two or more children (573 women with cancer and 570 controls). A relative risk for breast cancer of 2.66 was seen in women who had given birth during the three years preceding the interview compared with women whose last birth had occurred 10 or more years before, after adjustment for age, age at first birth, and parity. The relative risk slowly decreased for women who had last given birth three to 10 years before. Multivariate analyses confirmed the protective effect of an early age at first birth and the age dependent effect of parity on the risk of breast cancer--that is, a direct relation below age 40 and an inverse one in older women. These data provide epidemiological evidence that a full term birth is followed by a transient increase in the risk of breast cancer, which for some time contrasts with and overcomes the long term protection of pregnancy at an early age. They therefore confirm predictions from animal studies and theoretical models that pregnancy prevents the early stages of breast carcinogenesis but promotes the late stages of the process.\r"

  ".W": "Over 18 months almost one quarter of infants born before 30 weeks' gestation in a tertiary perinatal centre who required intensive care had to be transferred to other tertiary centres because intensive care facilities were fully occupied. When infants with lethal congenital malformations were excluded half of the 34 infants who were transferred died; this was twice the mortality (24%) in the 111 infants remaining. The difference between the groups was significant (relative odds = 3.1) and remained so after adjustment for any discrepancies in gestational age (relative odds = 4.0). After adjustment for potential confounding variables by logistic function regression the risk of dying for those transferred remained significantly higher than that for infants who remained (relative odds = 4.6, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 12.1). As the requirement for neonatal intensive care is episodic and unpredictable more flexibility has to be built into the perinatal health care system to enable preterm infants delivered in tertiary perinatal centres to be cared for where they are born.\r"

Cases of dementia were identified by research psychiatrists using the Cambridge mental disorders of the elderly examination (CAMDEX), a new structured diagnostic interview. General practitioners correctly identified dementia as at least a possibility in 121 of the 208 cases found. Nevertheless, they mistakenly rated as demented several patients suffering from functional psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. Community nurses correctly identified dementia as at least a possibility in 64 of the 74 demented patients known to them, but they incorrectly suspected dementia in a greater proportion of instances. Both general practitioners and families appeared to have low expectations of what general practice has to offer demented elderly people. General practitioners should take the initiative in diagnosing dementia in very elderly patients who show signs of the condition. In some cases it may be secondary to treatable disorders, and in others all that may be required are understanding, support, and advice to families.\r"

All 165 of the districts that responded screened for loss of distant visual acuity; 96% screened for loss of colour vision, 73% for squint, and 67% for loss of near visual acuity. The frequency with which districts screened varied considerably. Some districts screened yearly, and various different types of tests were used. In many districts children were screened in unsuitable places, such as corridors, assembly halls, and toilets. Criteria for referral varied from one district to another, and few districts collected data appropriate for monitoring their screening programmes. Many districts screened more intensively than could be justified on the basis of the conditions tested for and the likely benefit of remedial treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Although tetanus is now rare, vaccination is currently recommended for the entire population. Most elderly North Americans have never received tetanus vaccination. We evaluated the expected cost-effectiveness of using mailed reminders from family physicians to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage among elderly Canadians. We estimated that over 10 years the program would prevent five cases of tetanus and one death from tetanus, resulting in a gain of 13 life-years. There would be 16,700 adverse reactions to tetanus toxoid, 17% in people already immune to tetanus. The net cost of the program (in 1984 Canadian dollars) would be $1.9 million per case of tetanus prevented, $7.1 million per death prevented and $810,000 per life-year gained. These high cost-effectiveness ratios are largely attributable to the very low risk of tetanus, even among nonimmune elderly people. Tetanus toxoid and physicians' services for vaccination would account for 86% of the program costs. Because the mailed reminders would be responsible for only 13% of the program costs, other possible programs to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage could not be expected to have substantially lower cost-effectiveness ratios. We conclude that efforts to increase primary tetanus vaccination coverage among elderly Canadians would be a questionable use of health care resources.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we examined the effects of various plasminogen activators on arachidonic acid release and prostacyclin biosynthesis in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Prostacyclin was the major product formed from arachidonic acid in aortic smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. When intact cells were incubated with streptokinase, one of the plasminogen activators, a significant stimulatory effect on prostacyclin biosynthetic activity in cells was evident without any cellular damage at all concentrations used (1-5,000 units/ml). Streptokinase also caused a marked release of arachidonic acid. However, when it was incubated with cell-free homogenates and [3H]arachidonic acid, it did not show any effects on prostacyclin biosynthesis. The addition of urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator had no effect on prostacyclin biosynthesis. Urokinase stimulated the release of arachidonic acid from cells, but it did not show any effect on prostacyclin release at any concentration of urokinase (1-5,000 units/ml). The release of arachidonic acid and the increased prostacyclin synthesis were not observed when tissue-type plasminogen activator was added. These results indicate that, among various plasminogen activators investigated, only streptokinase causes the release of arachidonic acid and prostacyclin. This could be a beneficial effect in thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "A previous study has suggested that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) alters arterial baroreflex control of lumbar and renal sympathetic nerve activity. To explore these mechanisms, we examined the interrelationship of arterial pressure, afferent aortic nerve activity, and aortic diameter in rabbits anesthetized with alpha-chloralose before and after sinoaortic denervation and bilateral vagotomy. Arterial pressure was decreased in stepwise fashion by intravenous infusion of alpha-human ANP (alpha-hANP, 0.1-1.0 microgram/kg/min) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 1-5 micrograms/kg/min). Both in rabbits with intact baroreceptors and in those with baroreceptors denervated, aortic nerve activity and the aortic diameter decreased during hypotension caused by the infusion of SNP but remained unchanged during hypotension caused by the infusion of alpha-hANP. In addition, we examined the effects of alpha-hANP and SNP on the responses of the aortic diameter and aortic nerve activity to rapid changes in arterial pressure caused by intravenous phenylephrine or nitroglycerin. Changes in aortic nerve activity and the aortic diameter in response to rapid changes in arterial pressure caused by phenylephrine or nitroglycerin were not different between the infusion of alpha-hANP and SNP. These results suggest that aortic nerve activity remains unchanged despite hypotension during the infusion of alpha-hANP, because alpha-hANP dilates the aorta. Since the aortic diameter increases, strain of aortic baroreceptors does not decrease. A second suggestion is that alpha-hANP does not alter aortic baroreceptor responses to changes in arterial pressure caused by phenylephrine or nitroglycerin.\r"

  ".W": "The human stratum corneum constitutes a relatively impermeable barrier to the transdermal absorption of most substances, including polypeptides and proteins. This double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 13 normal men evaluated whether a low level of electrical current could induce changes in cutaneous permeability sufficient to produce absorption of a polypeptide. We compared cutaneous absorption of 5 mg of leuprolide (a 9 amino acid luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue) in transdermal patches containing 0.2 mA electrical current (active) and in patches containing no electrical current (passive). Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration was measured 12 times during an 8-hour period as a measure of drug effect. Similar baseline LH levels were seen in each group: active = 11.3 +/- 3.1 mIU/ml and passive = 13.7 +/- 4.7 mIU/ml (p not significant). Significant elevations of LH were seen in active compared with passive patches (p = 0.0084). As predicted, passive patches produced no elevation of LH concentration (LH = 11.8 +/- 7.1 mIU/ml at 4 hours). However, active patches produced elevations comparable to those achieved with subcutaneous administration of the drug (LH = 56.4 +/- 49.6 mIU/ml at 4 hours and p = 0.003 compared with passive). The patches were well tolerated without significant cutaneous toxicity. It is concluded that the use of low levels of electrical current can induce changes in the permeability of the stratum corneum. These changes are sufficient to promote the transdermal absorption of therapeutically relevant amounts of a polypeptide. This has major importance for our understanding of skin permeability and for the development of new techniques for drug administration.\r"

The effect of acetate absorbed from the gut on glucose turnover has been determined in four healthy subjects during both fasting and an intravenous glucose infusion by using [U-13C]glucose. 2. In the first part of the study, after an overnight fast, a tracer dose of [U-13C]glucose was infused at a constant rate along with an infusion of saline for 7 h. In the second part the saline infusion was replaced by glucose at 4.25 mg min-1 kg-1. In both studies 15 mmol of sodium acetate was given by mouth at 15 min intervals from the fourth to the sixth hour. Glucose turnover, respiratory quotient, metabolic rate and blood levels of acetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, insulin, glucagon and gastric inhibitory polypeptide were measured. 3. Glucose turnover rates (means +/- SEM) were 1.88 +/- 0.1 mg min-1 kg-1 during fasting and 4.0 +/- 0.08 mg min-1 kg-1 during glucose infusion. Acetate had no effect on glucose turnover, insulin, glucagon and gastric inhibitory polypeptide levels, but temporarily halted the rise in free fatty acids seen during the fasting study. No changes in oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide output occurred, in keeping with previous observations that acetate substitutes for lipid oxidation during metabolism and has no direct effect on glucose turnover.\r"

Plasma renin activity tended to decrease during the infusion of hANP, while plasma aldosterone concentration decreased during and increased after stopping the infusion of hANP. 5. The data suggest that hANP inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and water by an action on distal segments of the nephron and perhaps the proximal tubule.

  ".W": "The expression of HLA-DR antigens on the surface of immune cells is crucial for appropriate antigen presentation and a normal immune response. In the intestinal mucosa involved by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis the expression of HLA-DR antigens is increased in both immune and nonimmune cells, a phenomenon probably mediated by soluble factors, such as interferon gamma, produced by locally activated mononuclear cells. This study investigated the production of interferon gamma by inflammatory bowel disease and control intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells, and the ability of this endogenously produced lymphokine to induce expression of HLA-DR antigens on the monocytic cell lines U937 and ML3. After in vitro stimulation with interleukin 2 or phytohemagglutinin, but not spontaneously, lamina propria mononuclear cells produced variable amounts of interferon gamma, and their culture supernatants could induce de novo expression of HLA-DR antigens on the monocytic indicator cells. When the mononuclear cells were derived from inflammatory bowel disease mucosa, both the amount of interferon gamma present in the supernatants and the number of HLA-DR-positive cells induced by these supernatants were decreased as compared to controls. These results suggest that, in inflammatory bowel disease, interferon gamma may not be the only mediator of HLA-DR induction in the gut and that other soluble factors or agents, alone or interacting with interferon gamma, may also be responsible for this event, resulting in the enhanced HLA-DR antigen expression observed in the inflamed intestinal mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The feedback effects of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) on FSH and LH secretion were compared in dispersed pituitary cells from adult male rats perifused with pulses of GnRH. Cells were stimulated with 10 nM GnRH for 2 min every 1 h. T (10 nM) pretreatment for 24 h reduced the amplitude of FSH and LH pulses to 77 +/- 4% (mean +/- SE) and 47 +/- 3% of control values, respectively (P less than 0.01), whereas 6-h T treatment was without effect. By contrast, interpulse secretion of FSH was increased after 24 h T to 184 +/- 7% of the control value (P less than 0.01), but interpulse LH release was unchanged (104 +/- 5%). E2 (0.075 nM) treatment of pituitary cells reduced GnRH-stimulated FSH and LH release within 2 h to 75 +/- 2% and 73 +/- 3% of control values, respectively (P less than 0.01). E2 pretreatment for 24 h stimulated (P less than 0.025) GnRH-induced FSH (136 +/- 10%) and LH (145 +/- 8%) release and also increased (P less than 0.01) interpulse FSH (127 +/- 5%) and LH (145 +/- 8%) secretion. These data indicate that the suppression of FSH and LH secretion by T in males is due in part to a direct effect on the pituitary. The findings that T suppresses GnRH-stimulated FSH less than LH, and that T stimulates interpulse FSH, but not LH, provide evidence for differential regulation of FSH and LH secretion by T. The dissimilar actions of T on GnRH-stimulated pulses and interpulse gonadotropin secretion suggest that interpulse secretion is unrelated to stimulation by GnRH, although its physiological significance is unknown. Since E2, in physiological levels for males, increased pituitary FSH and LH secretion, the suppression of gonadotropin secretion by E2 in vivo in males may result from an effect on the hypothalamic pulse generator; however, additional studies are needed before extending these conclusions to higher mammals and men.\r"

  ".W": "The consequences of human GH (hGH) secretion on hypothalamic, pituitary, and testicular functions in adult male transgenic mice bearing the hGH gene were evaluated. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp I, transgenic and nontransgenic littermate mice were treated with saline or GnRH in saline (1 ng/g BW). Fifteen minutes after the above treatment, blood samples were obtained for hormone measurements. In Exp II, transgenic and nontransgenic littermate mice were bilaterally castrated, treated with peanut oil or testosterone propionate (TP; 1 microgram/g BW). Blood samples were obtained from half of the animals at 24 h and from the remaining mice 48 h after oil or TP injection. In transgenic mice expressing the hGH gene, plasma PRL levels were significantly lower (P less than 0.001), but circulating LH levels were higher (P less than 0.001) than those in their normal littermates. Administration of GnRH significantly increased (P less than 0.001) plasma LH levels in both groups of mice. However, relative to basal LH levels, the LH response to GnRH treatment was attenuated in transgenic mice. Basal as well as GnRH-stimulated levels of FSH and testosterone were similar in transgenic and nontransgenic littermate mice. In normal castrated mice, plasma LH levels were significantly suppressed (P less than 0.001) 24 h after a single injection of TP. However, the same treatment was ineffective in transgenic mice. The negative feedback effect of TP on plasma FSH levels was also attenuated in transgenic mice. Since it is known that hyperprolactinemia increases LH secretion in male mice, our results demonstrate that transgenic mice are hypoprolactinemic with regard to pituitary PRL secretion, yet due to the lactogenic function of hGH, these animals are physiologically hyperprolactinemic. Thus, the expression of the hGH gene results in a derangement of hypothalamic-pituitary function in adult male transgenic mice.\r"

  ".W": "In parathyroid cells, high extracellular Ca2+ promotes a rapid increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3), suggesting activation of phospholipase C. Available data, however, indicate a high Ca2+-induced decrease in sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DG), rather than the increase expected with hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. To explore this apparent discrepancy between IP3 and DG, we used three methods to quantify DG levels in parathyroid cells in response to high Ca2+ over the time course when IP3 levels increase. A simple enzymatic method was developed for the quantitation of the mass of DG present in crude lipid extracts. The assay employed rat brain DG kinase and defined mixed micellar conditions to solubilize the DG present and allow its quantitative conversion to [32P]phosphatidic acid. [32P]Phosphatidic acid formed in the assay was directly proportional to the amount of DG added over the range of 25 pmol to 25 nmol or to the number of parathyroid cells (5 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(6) cells). Parathyroid cells were also labeled with [3H]glycerol (24 h) or [3H]arachidonic acid (2 or 18 h) and exposed to various extracellular Ca2+ concentrations for different times. The total lipids were then extracted and separated by TLC. Using each of the three methods to measure DG, parathyroid cells showed a rapid increase in DG when extracellular Ca2+ was increased from 0.5 to 2.0 or 3.0 mM. The maximal increase occurred at 5-20 s. The levels of DG at high Ca2+ then decreased to levels 20-50% higher than those at 0.5 mM Ca2+ from 60 sec to 10 min. DG levels remained higher at 2-3 mM Ca2+ than at 0.5 mM Ca2+ even at 30 min. Similar results were obtained in 10 independent experiments with the kinase method, 7 independent experiments with the [3H]glycerol method, and 12 independent experiments with the [3H]arachidonic acid method. These results show the high Ca2+ rapidly increases intracellular levels of DG as well as IP3 in bovine parathyroid cells, consistent with activation of phospholipase C. Thus, the initial rapid decrease in PTH release at high Ca2+ is not caused by a concomitant decrease in DG, but is presumably related to additional inhibitory mechanisms that override the high Ca2+-induced increases in DG and cytosolic Ca2+.\r"

Adiol 17-G is the predominant Adiol G isomer derived from DHT in normal men. To determine whether peripheral tissues may be responsible for this selective conversion of DHT to Adiol 17-G, a glucuronyl transferase assay was developed using rat prostate cells. Adiol 17-G was separated from Adiol 3-G by HPLC and selective precipitation with an antibody specific for Adiol 3-G. Using androstanediol (Adiol) as a substrate, enzyme kinetics were linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration. In the presence of 0 or 5 microM Adiol and 1 microCi [3H]Adiol, greater than 99% of the resulting Adiol G was Adiol 17-G. The percent conversions of DHT, Adiol, and androsterone to their glucuronide conjugates were 0.22%, 3.5%, and 0.24%/10(6) prostate cells, respectively. Using DHT as an inhibitor of Adiol glucuronidation, the Ki was 39.1 microM, compared to an apparent Km for Adiol of 15 microM. We conclude that rat prostate cells can selectively convert Adiol to Adiol 17-G, and that Adiol glucuronidation is favored over that of DHT or androsterone under these experimental conditions. Since DHT and Adiol are readily interconvertable, these results suggest that Adiol 17-G is the major DHT metabolite in the rat prostate.\r"

  ".U": "89064606\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the influences of dopamine and the D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine on phosphoinositide metabolism in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells, monitoring changes in the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P], and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]. Basal incorporation of [3H]inositol ([3H]Ins) into phosphoinositides was progressive, and radioisotopic equilibrium was attained in all three species within 48 h. The inclusion of dopamine or bromocriptine in the incubation medium promoted concentration-dependent reductions in the rate, but not the magnitude, of phosphoinositide radiolabeling. The onset of this effect was rapid; inhibition of [3H]Ins incorporation by dopamine (500 nM) and bromocriptine (100 nM) could be detected within 2 h. This treatment also produced a comparable reduction in the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into PtdIns(4,5)P2. In extended time-course studies, bromocriptine dramatically retarded the radiolabeling of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and apparent equilibria in these species were attained only after 96 h. We also assessed the ability of dopamine to modify the concentration-response characteristics of [3H]Ins-labeled inositol phosphate ([3H]InsPx) production by TRH, angiotensin II (AII), neurotensin (NTS), bombesin (BBS), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Neither dopamine nor bromocriptine altered the rate or magnitude of TRH-, AII-, NTS-, or BBS-related InsPx generation. VIP was completely ineffective in stimulating InsPx generation. PRL release was significantly reduced in all dopamine-treated groups. That the InsPx concentration-response relationships for each of these peptides remained unimpaired by exposure to dopamine or bromocriptine extends our previous observation that the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase-C is insensitive to dopaminergic tone. Consistent with our earlier findings, these data indicate that activation of the D2 dopamine receptor attenuates the activity of mechanisms associated with the serial phosphorylations of PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P, reactions that give rise to PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively. It is our conclusion that dopamine, in addition to its other actions, attenuates the phosphorylation, rather than the hydrolysis, of anterior pituitary phosphoinositide. This attenuation appears to be mediated by an inhibitory coupling of the D2 receptor with the phosphoryltransferase activities that catalyze PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The positive inotropic effect of TRH was associated with an augmentation of slow action potentials in high K+ solution and was reduced in the presence of diltiazem, verapamil, and manganese. TRH potentiated the response of contractile force to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The inotropic effect of TRH was suppressed by metoclopramide, phentolamine, and cimetidine, but was not affected by propranolol. TRH increased the contractile force even in the myocardium of reserpinized guinea pig. It is suggested that TRH has a positive inotropic effect at least partly due to an increase in the slow inward Ca2+ current.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook the present studies with several objectives in mind: 1) to determine whether recombinant rat gamma-interferon (r gamma IFN) would induce expression of the class II major histocompatibility antigen (Ia) in rat thyroid follicular cells (FRTL5) in culture as human gamma IFN does in cultured human thyrocytes; 2) to characterize the properties of this response, if it does indeed occur; 3) to ascertain whether r gamma IFN has any effect on the growth or differentiated function of FRTL5 cells; and 4) to determine how, if at all, effects of r gamma IFN on the growth and function of FRTL5 cells might be related to expression of the Ia antigen. At concentrations between 1 and 30 U/ml, r gamma IFN induced expression of Ia antigen in a concentration-dependent manner. With a supramaximal concentration of r gamma IFN, Ia antigen first appeared between 4 and 16 h and reached a maximum concentration at about 36 h. After removal of r gamma IFN, the Ia antigen concentration remained constant for about 24 h and then declined, becoming undetectable by 72 h. Induction could not be detected in FRTL5 cells cultured with human gamma IFN, rat non-gamma IFN, Concanavalin-A, phytohemagglutinin, or bovine TSH (bTSH). Over the same range of concentrations that induced the Ia antigen, r gamma IFN proved to be a potent inhibitor of the growth of FRTL5 cells induced by a variety of agents. It produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation and cell replication in FRTL5 cells induced by bTSH. This effect was unaccompanied by any inhibition of either the binding of bTSH to FRTL5 cells or the bTSH-induced increase in cellular cAMP concentration induced therein. However, r gamma IFN did inhibit the stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation into DNA induced by (Bu)2cAMP. r gamma IFN also inhibited the stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell replication induced by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) without affecting the specific binding of IGF-I, and decreased the extent of stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA). Thus, r gamma IFN inhibited both the cAMP-dependent pathway of growth activated by TSH, doing so at some post-cAMP locus, and the cAMP-independent pathways of growth regulation that are activated by IGF-I and TPA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Pituitary FSH content was transiently increased during metestrus and diestrus, but was elevated at 1000 h through 1900 h on proestrus (peak 5-fold increase). FSH content fell rapidly at 2000h and remained low until 1400 h on estrus when values again rose. These data show that FSH beta mRNA is increased 4-5 fold during the proestrus FSH surge, and a smaller increase occurs on metestrus in the absence of elevated FSH secretion. The increased concentrations of FSH beta mRNA occurred at different times to the previously reported changes in alpha and LH beta mRNAs. Therefore, the data suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the regulation of LH and FSH beta subunit gene expression during the 4-day estrous cycle in rats.\r"

Nutritional support for 21 days was randomised to total parenteral nutrition and nil by mouth (n = 17), defined formula diet administered through a nasogastric tube (n = 19), or partial parenteral nutrition and oral food (n = 15). Nutrient input in the first two groups provided 40 non-protein kcal/kg ideal body weight /d and 1g/ kg/d protein respectively, while the third group received 15 non-protein kcal/kg/d and 0.3 g/kg/d protein intravenously and ate unrestricted food. Clinical remissions occurred in 71% of patients on parenteral nutrition, in 58% on the defined formula diet and in 60% on partial parenteral nutrition; the probability for each group of being in remission at one year, after successful therapy was 42%, 55%, and 56% respectively. These differences were not significant. In patients with active Crohn's disease bowel rest was not a major factor in achieving a remission during nutritional support and did not influence outcome during one year's follow-up.\r"

Iodination of intrinsic factor cobalamin complex with N-chlorobenzene-sulphonamide beads did not modify its physicochemical properties in gel filtration, nor in iso-electrofocusing. It didn't affect its biological activity either in vitro in presence of solubilised receptor, or in vivo in the Schilling test. The 125I-intrinsic factor cobalamin complex was instilled in vivo in ileal blind loops in presence of either CaCl2, EDTA, bile or intestinal juice. The labelled complex was predominantly located in the intermicrovillous pits of the apical membrane and in the apical cytoplasm. The uptake was about five-fold lower in presence of EDTA. On the apical membrane, the number of grains (per 80 micron length of epithelium) increased from 2.7 (0.2) up to 9.4 (1.7) respectively for 15 minutes and two hours of delay. This suggests a recycling of the intrinsic factor receptor complex. In the apical compartment, the silver grains were often detected over non-coated vesicles and over the infoldings of the lateral membrane. These results show that intrinsic factor is internalised into enterocytes during cobalamin absorption, and that a part of intrinsic factor enters the blood circulation through transcytosis.\r"

The GABAA receptor is a member of a family of receptor-operated ion channels to which the nicotinic cholinergic receptor-cation channel and the glycine receptor-anion channel belong. The GABAA receptor, formed by two different subunits with structural homologies, contains at least two pharmacologically important allosteric modulatory sites, one being the BZR. The BZR responds to two classes of active ligands, namely the so-called BZR agonists, which produce a positive modulation of GABAA receptor function resulting in anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, sedative, and muscle relaxant activity, and the so-called BZR inverse agonists, which produce a negative allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor function resulting in a mirror image of the agonist profile. The effects of these two extreme classes of ligands (with maximal positive and negative intrinsic efficacy, respectively) are blocked by BZR antagonists, ligands of the BZR devoid of relevant intrinsic efficacy. Flumazenil is the first BZR antagonist available for therapeutic use. The molecular basis of the activities of BZR ligands and of their interactions has enormously increased our understanding of the complex function of neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters.\r"

  ".W": "The 7 alpha-hydroxylation of two cholesterol analogues, sitosterol and cholestanol, and their effect on the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol were measured in rat and human hepatic microsomes. In untreated rat liver microsomes, the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol was higher than that of cholestanol (1.4-fold) and sitosterol (30-fold). After removal of endogenous sterols from the microsomes by acetone treatment, the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol was similar to that of cholestanol and only fourfold higher than that of sitosterol. Cholestanol and sitosterol competitively inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in both rat and human liver microsomes, with cholestanol the more potent inhibitor. Patients with sitosterolemia with xanthomatosis, who have elevated microsomal cholestanol and sitosterol, showed reduced cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity relative to the activity in control subjects (13.9 and 14.7 vs. 20.3 +/- 0.9 pmol/nmol P-450 per min, P less than 0.01). Enzyme activity in these patients was 40% higher when measured in microsomes from which competing sterols had been removed. Ileal bypass surgery in one sitosterolemic patient decreased plasma cholestanol and sitosterol concentrations and resulted in a 30% increase in hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase appears to have a specific apolar binding site for the side chain of cholesterol and is affected by the presence of cholestanol and sitosterol in the microsomal substrate pool. Reduced bile acid synthesis in sitosterolemia with xanthomatosis may be related to the inhibition of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity by endogenous cholesterol analogues.\r"

Similar increases were evoked by 2 microM glyburide (329 +/- 41 nM). After 3 h of insulin infusion, basal [Ca2+]i rose to 234 +/- 21 nM, but the responses to insulin and glyburide were completely abolished. In vitro insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was reduced by insulin and glucose infusion (25% stimulation before infusion, 5.4% at 3 h, and 0.85% at 6 h of infusion). In obese patients, basal adipocyte [Ca2+]i was increased (203 +/- 14 nM, P less than 0.05 vs. normals). The [Ca2+]i response demonstrated resistance to insulin (230 +/- 23 nM) and glyburide (249 +/- 19 nM) stimulation. Continuous insulin infusion increased basal [Ca2+]i (244 +/- 24 nM) and there was no response to either insulin or glyburide at 3 and 6 h of study. Rat adipocytes were preincubated with 1-10 mM glucose and 10 ng/ml insulin for 24 h. Measurements of 2-deoxyglucose uptake demonstrated insulin resistance in these cells. Under these experimental conditions, increased levels of [Ca2+]i that were no longer responsive to insulin were demonstrated. Verapamil in the preincubation medium prevented the development of insulin resistance.\r"

IL-2 elicited a steady increase in PGI2 synthesis by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and bovine aortic endothelial cells but had no effect on vWf or tPA. Both purified natural IL-2 (nIL-2) and rIL-2 induced significant PGI2 synthesis. Substitution of the cysteine residue at position 125 of rIL-2 with serine or alanine led to loss of PGI2-stimulatory activity in HUVECS without affecting thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes. HPLC analysis of arachidonate metabolites detected predominantly 6 keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha) peak. Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with cycloheximide and actinomycin D resulted in inhibition of 6KPGF1 alpha synthesis. The Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against PGH synthase revealed an increment in the 70-kD subunit of PGH synthase by nIL-2 and rIL-2, but not by alanine-substituted rIL-2. We conclude that IL-2 stimulated sustained PGI2 production by a mechanism that includes the de novo synthesis of PGH synthase. This mechanism for regulating AA metabolism probably has important physiologic implications.\r"

Compared with age-matched heterosexual men and HIV-negative homosexual men, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from seropositive men showed decreased proliferation to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and decreased CD4+ T-helper activity on PWM-driven differentiation of normal donor B cells. Monocytes of HIV-infected homosexual men showed decreased accessory function on normal T cell proliferation induced by CD3 monoclonal antibody. The most striking defect in leukocyte functional activities was observed in the B cells of HIV-infected men. B cells of 13 out of 14 seropositive men failed to produce Ig in response to PWM in the presence of adequate allogeneic T-helper activity. These findings suggest that HIV induces severe immunological abnormalities in T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells early in infection before CD4+ T cell numbers start to decline. Impaired immunological function in subclinically HIV-infected patients may have clinical implications for vaccination strategies, in particular the use of live vaccines in groups with a high prevalence of HIV seropositivity.\r"

In vivo desensitization of this Ca2+ messenger system was studied in hepatocytes isolated from either pheochromocytoma (PHEO)-harboring and chronically norepinephrine (NE)-infused rats. Homologous desensitization for alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated phosphorylase activation developed in the early stage of PHEO rats (3-4 wk after implantation), whereas, in the later stage of tumor development or in the NE-infused rats, phosphorylase responses to all Ca2+-mobilizing stimulations were subsensitive (heterologous desensitization). In the homologous desensitization, the [Ca2+]c response to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was selectively reduced. We found, using the phenoxybenzamine inactivation method, that there was a linear relationship between alpha 1 receptor density and the [Ca2+]c response; consequently, the blunted [Ca2+]c response to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation could not be explained by the 34% downregulation of alpha 1 receptors seen in these rats. These results indicated that uncoupling at a step proximal to alpha 1 receptor-stimulated [Ca2+]c increase is also of primary importance in homologous desensitization of phosphorylase activation. On the other hand, heterologous desensitization also involved alteration(s) at steps distal to the rise in [Ca2+]c. Our data demonstrate that prolonged exposure to catecholamines results in desensitization of the [Ca2+]c mobilization pathway and may involve multiple mechanisms.\r"

In contrast, although native Glu-plasminogen bound specifically to these cells, affinity was low. Lys-plasminogen inhibited the binding of Glu-plasminogen but the opposite was not true. Molecular analysis of the bound ligands indicated that Glu-plasminogen was converted to Lys-plasminogen and Lys-plasminogen to plasmin on the cell surface but not in the supernatant. Peritoneal macrophages from patients with indwelling catheters and tissue macrophages in chronic inflammatory lesions were shown to express immunologically identified Lys-plasminogen on their surfaces. Therefore binding and surface activation of kinetically favored Lys-plasminogen may provide an important physiological mechanism for localizing proteolytic activity on the surface of inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two plasmin-resistant mutant forms of pro-urokinase (pro-UK) constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of Lys158 to Val158 and Met158 were used to evaluate the intrinsic enzymatic and fibrinolytic properties of pro-UK as distinct from those of its two-chain UK (TC-UK) derivative. Both mutants, while resistant to plasmin activation, were as sensitive as pro-UK to degradation by thrombin. Since thrombin cleaves a peptide bond only two residues from the activation site, the integrity of this loop was maintained in the two mutants. The amidolytic and plasminogen-activating activities of the mutants averaged 0.14 and 0.12% that of TC-UK, respectively. The fibrin plate activities were 2,400 IU/ml and 700 IU/mg for the Met158 and Val158 mutants or about 1.5% that of TC-UK. These findings attest to a discrete but low intrinsic activity for pro-UK and suggest that the higher values reported in the literature may be related to UK contaminants or plasmin-induced TC-UK generation during the assay. Clot lysis by the mutants required doses greater than 100-fold higher than those of pro-UK to induce a comparable effect. From this it appears that pro-UK activation is a major determinant of the rate of clot lysis occurring with pro-UK. Clot lysis by the mutants was potentiated by plasmin pretreatment of the fibrin and by the addition of small amounts of TC-UK or tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Combinations of t-PA and the mutants were synergistic in their fibrinolytic effects. These findings mirror those previously obtained with pro-UK. We concluded that the previously described potentiation of pro-UK-induced clot lysis by UK or t-PA is mediated primarily by pro-UK itself rather than by a promotion of its activation.\r"

Five out of seven CD3- T-ALL and 4 of 12 CD3+ T-ALL showed bi-allelic rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene. In three CD3+ patients, a single allelic TCR-delta gene rearrangement was observed with rearrangement of the TCR-alpha gene on the other allele. In five CD3+ patients with bi-allelic rearrangements of the TCR-alpha gene, the TCR-delta gene locus was deleted. Transcription of the TCR-delta gene was also analyzed in six T-ALL. Five patients expressed TCR-delta transcripts. Only one T-ALL, presumably derived from the most immature T lineage cells, did not have TCR-delta transcripts, but expressed TCR-gamma and 1.0-kb truncated TCR-beta transcripts. In B-precursor ALL, 20 patients (69%) showed rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene. The frequency of TCR-delta gene rearrangement was higher than TCR-alpha (59%), gamma (52%), or beta (31%) genes. These findings suggest that TCR-alpha gene rearrangements may take place after rearrangements of the TCR-delta gene with concomitant deletion of rearranged TCR-delta genes in T cell differentiation. Among leukemic cells of B lineage, the TCR-delta gene is the earliest rearranging TCR gene, followed by TCR-gamma and beta gene rearrangements.\r"

After incubation with 1 microM [14C]arachidonic acid for 24 h, the cells were stimulated with 1 microM A23187 for times up to 30 min. Uptake of [14C]arachidonic acid and its distribution among cell lipids were unaffected by the increased glucose concentration. The release of eicosanoids from labeled cells and unlabeled cells was measured by reverse-phase HPLC and by RIA, respectively. Compared with cells stimulated in the presence of normal glucose concentrations, cells stimulated in the presence of elevated glucose released 62.6% less free [14C]arachidonic acid, but released 129% more 14C-labeled 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). Increased release of 15-HETE in the presence of elevated glucose in response to A23187, bradykinin, and thrombin was confirmed by RIA. A similar increase in 5-HETE release was observed by RIA after A23187 treatment. The release of both radiolabeled and unlabeled prostanoids was equal at both glucose concentrations. The data indicate that glucose may play an important role in the regulation of release and metabolism of arachidonic acid after agonist stimulation. In the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, such as those associated with diabetes mellitus, the extent and pattern of eicosanoid release from endothelial cells is markedly altered.\r"

  ".W": "We used a physiological stimulus, chronic dynamic exercise, in pigs to examine resultant changes in chronotropic responsiveness to catecholamine and biochemical features of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein, GS. Long-term treadmill running resulted in a substantial (44%) down-regulation of right atrial beta-adrenergic receptors, but the dose of isoproterenol yielding a 50% maximal increase in heart rate was decreased by 57% (from 0.07 +/- 0.03 to 0.03 +/- 0.01 microgram/kg; P less than 0.02) despite this decrease in receptor number. This disparity between receptor number and physiological responsiveness suggested altered signal transduction. We therefore quantitated GS in myocardial membranes obtained before and after chronic exercise in a competitive ELISA based on an antipeptide antibody developed to the alpha S portion of GS. We found a 42% increase in the amounts of GS in right atrial membranes (from 11.4 +/- 0.8 to 16.2 +/- 2.0 pmol/mg; P less than 0.05) and a 76% increase in the amounts of GS in left ventricular membranes (from 15.6 +/- 2.6 to 27.4 +/- 5.2 pmol/mg; P = 0.02) after chronic running. These data suggest that in the heart physiological perturbations can result in changes in the levels of GS, that GS and beta-adrenergic receptor number are not coordinately regulated, and that GS may contribute to altered adrenergic responsiveness independently of changes in beta-adrenergic receptor number.\r"

However, if B cells were cultured with anti-Ig antibodies and IFN-gamma before fixation they acquired excellent T cell stimulatory activity. Neither reagent alone conferred this novel co-stimulatory function on the B cell surface. The activity induced by both stimuli was not attributed to an increase expression of class II-MHC molecules or IL-1. IL-2 or IL-4, in combination with anti-Ig, also induced B cell stimulatory activity, but were less effective than IFN-gamma. TNF failed to stimulate B cells, but synergized with IFN-gamma in the induction of this activity. These studies therefore demonstrate an important role for lymphokines in modulating B cell Ag-presenting activity as well as the acquisition by B cells of a novel co-stimulatory surface activity.\r"

  ".U": "89067491\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the activation of murine macrophages to a fully tumoricidal state requires that specific environmental signals be delivered to the macrophage in a step-wise manner: a \"priming\" signal first renders the macrophage stimulated, but not cytolytic. The addition of a second or \"trigger\" signal to the primed macrophage results in tumoricidal activity. One potent priming signal has been identified as IFN-gamma and one often used trigger signal for endotoxin-responsive (Lpsn) macrophages is LPS. In contrast to LPS-responsive macrophage, rIFN-gamma-primed C3H/HeJ (Lpsd) macrophages fail to become cytolytic in response to protein-free, phenol-water-extracted LPS preparations, but become tumoricidal when exposed in vitro to protein-rich butanol-extracted LPS or purified lipid A-associated proteins. Further characterization of the activation requirements of the C3H/HeJ macrophages revealed that for optimal elaboration of TNF in vitro, two signals were also required: rIFN-gamma and a second signal that contained LAP. C3H/HeJ macrophages macrophages primed with rIFN-gamma failed to produce TNF in response to any concentration of protein-free phenol-water extracted LPS, even when supernatants were concentrated before assaying for functional activity in a standard TNF L929 fibroblast assay. Although exposure of rIFN-gamma-primed C3H/HeJ macrophages to LAP resulted in a fully tumoricidal state equivalent to that exhibited by C3H/OuJ macrophages, the levels of TNF produced remained discrepant. Under identical conditions, C3H/OuJ macrophages produced approximately fivefold more TNF (11,776 U/ml) than C3H/HeJ macrophages (2,399 U/ml). This suggests that although C3H/HeJ macrophages can respond functionally in a \"normal\" manner given the correct signals, they remain quantitatively deficient in the production of certain proteins. In this system, the elaboration of TNF and macrophage-mediated tumor cell lysis were shown to be dissociable events. The tumor target used in these studies (P815) was shown to be resistant to as much as 40,000 U/ml of purified rTNF. In addition, C3H/OuJ macrophage cultures exposed to LPS only (which resulted in the production of high levels of TNF), failed to lyse these targets. Lastly, anti-mouse TNF antibody added to macrophage cultures had no effect on the induction of tumor cell lysis.\r"

  ".U": "89067496\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of macrophages to reach inflammatory loci is crucial in the function of cellular immunity. Invasive properties of macrophages may be due to the proteinase urokinase which binds to cell surface receptors, and thereby confers on macrophages the capacity for localized proteolysis of the interstitium. Here, we investigated the role of the macrophage-activating factors IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF and of urokinase on the expression of urokinase receptors by human cultured monocytes. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induced increased urokinase binding to human cultured monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. At optimal concentrations, IFN-gamma (200 U/ml) increased the number of receptors/cell from 14,000 to 64,000, TNF-alpha (50 U/ml) to 30,000, and combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha to 90,000. Granulocyte-macrophage-CSF had no effect. The enhanced urokinase binding is due to increased numbers of urokinase receptors and not an increased affinity of the receptor for urokinase. In the presence of urokinase during monocyte activation, IFN-gamma induced only 25,000 receptors/cell. However, urokinase does not inhibit increased receptor expression when the cells are activated with TNF-alpha. The effect of urokinase on induction of urokinase receptors by combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha varied with the dosage of TNF-alpha: A combination of IFN-gamma (200 U/ml) and TNF-alpha (15 U/ml) induced 38,000 receptors/cell in the presence and 90,000 receptors/cells in the absence of urokinase, whereas IFN-gamma (200 U/ml) and TNF-alpha (20 U/ml) induced 90,000 receptors/cell in the absence and presence of urokinase. These studies demonstrate that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and urokinase collectively regulate the number of urokinase receptors on human monocytes. The induction of urokinase receptors may be responsible for increased invasiveness of the activated macrophage.\r"

IL-2, but not the excipient detergents included in the rIL-2 preparation, induced the synthesis of both cytokines. The concentrations of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in the cell lysates and supernatants depended on both the concentration of rIL-2 in the culture medium and the duration of the incubation. After 24 h of stimulation, IL-2-induced IL-1 alpha remained almost entirely cell-associated. In contrast, IL-1 beta was present in both cell lysates and supernatants and was more abundant in the latter. SDS-PAGE analysis after radioimmunoprecipitation with anti-IL-1 antibodies indicates that cell-associated IL-1 resulting from IL-2 stimulation was in the form of the 35 kDa IL-1 precursor whereas secreted IL-1 was almost entirely in the form of the mature 18 kDa product. Depletion of monocytes from the PBMC culture substantially reduced IL-2-induced IL-1 production. In addition, Leu M3+ monocytes obtained through FACS, but not CD16+ NK cells, produced both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in response to IL-2. The low level of endotoxin present in the IL-2 preparation used in our studies and the selective inhibition by polymyxin B of LPS-induced, but not IL-2-induced, IL-1 production by PBMC indicate that IL-2-induced IL-1 production was not due to endotoxin contamination. Furthermore, an anti-IL-2 antiserum selectively inhibited IL-1 production in response to IL-2 stimulation. We conclude that IL-2 is a potent inducer of IL-1 synthesis and secretion in vitro and propose that IL-1 may be generated in vivo in patients undergoing IL-2 immunotherapy.\r"

Platelet activating factor (PAF) directly induced LTC4 production from eosinophils in a dose (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) and a time-dependent manner. PAF (10(-5) M) induced 0.74 +/- 0.08 ng of LTC4 production/10(6) eosinophils.

Furthermore, the pre-incubation of eosinophils with 5 micrograms/ml of cytochalasin B did not alter the chemotactic factor-induced LTC4 production. When eosinophils were stimulated by the submaximal concentration (1 microgram/ml) of calcium ionophore A23187, the pre-incubation of eosinophils with 10(-6) M or 10(-5) M of PAF, or 10(-5) M of eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis significantly enhanced LTC4 production up to 163.9 +/- 17.5% (p less than 0.05), 279.2 +/- 32.9% (p less than 0.01) and 165.2 +/- 21.2% (p less than 0.05) of the control, respectively. However, the pre-incubation with lyso-PAF or LTB4 failed to enhance A23187-induced LTC4 production. The pre-incubation of eosinophils with phosphatidyl serine also failed to enhance A23187-induced LTC4 production. However, the direct stimulation of protein kinase C by PMA enhanced the submaximal concentration of A23187-induced LTC4 production from eosinophils up to 179.5 +/- 20.9% (p less than 0.05) of the control. Our findings indicate that PAF and ECF-A work not only as chemotactic factors but also induce a functionally active state of eosinophils probably through their post-receptor mechanisms, and contribute to the inflammatory processes.\r"

The RBMMC release the preformed granule mediator beta-hexosaminidase both in response to immunologic stimulation with 200 ng Ag (net release 15.8 +/- 3.8%) and in response to 1 microM calcium ionophore A23187 (net release 21.8 +/- 6.8%). However, compound 48/80, substance P, and somatostatin did not induce mast cell degranulation. In experiments with optimal beta-hexosaminidase release, the RBMMC generated similar quantities of the newly formed arachidonic acid metabolites leukotriene C4 and PGD2 when stimulated with either Ag or calcium ionophore A23187. The RBMMC incorporate [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans consisting of 90% chondroitin sulfates and 10% heparin. The chondroitin sulfates were comprised of chondroitin 4 sulfate and chondroitin sulfate diB sulfated disaccharides in a ratio of 4/1. Although we show that RBMMC and MBMMC share a low histamine content, functional IgE receptors and unresponsiveness to cromolyn and selective secretagogues (compound 48/80, substance P, and somatostatin), we also provide evidence that RBMMC differ from MBMMC in their profile of newly generated mediators, preformed granule proteoglycan, and lack of proliferative response to mouse IL-3.\r"

Our data indicate: 1) human macrophages cultured in a 1/1 (v/v) mixture of HAM F-12:DME produce two- to three-fold greater quantities of procollagenase (but not TIMP) as compared to HAM F-12, DME, or alpha-MEM alone; 2) maximal collagenase expression requires the further addition of LPS, whereas TIMP production is optimized by 5% fetal bovine serum alone; 3) the up-regulation of macrophage procollagenase by LPS represents a highly selective biologic response when compared to changes induced in other secreted and intracellular proteins; 4) measurements of steady state procollagenase mRNA by Northern blot analysis suggest that the LPS effect is mediated at a pre-translational level; and finally 5) on a per cell basis, human alveolar macrophages cultured under optional conditions secrete approximately 20% of the collagenase and approximately 10% of the TIMP elaborated by stimulated human fibroblasts. We conclude that procollagenase and TIMP secretion by human alveolar macrophages in vitro is strikingly responsive to variations in cell culture conditions and that an especially noteworthy selective upregulation of procollagenase secretion by LPS is probably modulated by a transcriptional mechanism. The macrophage synthetic potential for procollagenase suggests a potentially important role for these cells in directly mediating collagen turnover.\r"

The development of vaccines that will prove efficacious in infants has been hindered by the lack of animal systems suitable for studying immunity to human pathogens. We have examined the BALB/c murine response to the capsular polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis group C (MCPS), a homopolymer of alpha(2----9) sialic acid, as a model system for the development of immunity to bacterial polysaccharides in man. We have observed the appearance of natural antibody of both IgM and IgG classes which increases with age, and the transfer of maternal IgG to the offspring. Both the naturally occurring and postimmunization serum responses are restricted to the IgM and IgG3 isotypes, and include antibody titers to both MCPS as well as a natural O-acetyl-negative variant (OAc-). The preimmune anti-OAc- antibodies, in contrast to anti-MCPS, were restricted to the IgM class, whereas after immunization with MCPS both IgM and low titers of IgG3 antibodies to OAc- were produced. These studies demonstrate that the BALB/c mouse strain shows a markedly similar immune profile to that observed in man.\r"

Whereas the serum response to MCPS is restricted to the IgM and IgG3 isotypes, the panel of mAb includes, in addition, both IgG1 and IgG2b. Among 15 mAb of four isotypes, seven different specificities were observed based on direct binding in a fluorescence ELISA and precipitation in gel. Although all the mAb were derived from mice immunized with bacteria encapsulated with the native MCPS (strain C11), only 7 of 15 reacted with MCPS alone. Seven of 15 reacted with a natural O-acetyl-negative variant (OAc-, strain MC19) polysaccharide as well as with MCPS. Five of these reacted as much as 3 logs better with OAc- than MCPS and the other two reacted better with MCPS than OAc-. One mAb appeared to be alpha(2----9)-linkage specific as it reacted not only with MCPS and OAc-, but also with the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K92, a polymer of sialic acid linked alternately alpha(2----8) and alpha(2----9). None of the mAb reacted with the capsular polysaccharide of E. coli K1, a homopolymer of alpha(2----8)-sialic acid. In general, there was a good correlation between the ability to precipitate Ag in gel and to agglutinate bacteria; however, 3 of 15 mAb, all IgG3, did not conform to this rule in that they precipitated Ag but did not agglutinate bacteria of the relevant capsular specificity. Antibodies of both IgM and IgG isotypes and of both major specificities, MCPS-specific and those binding MCPS and OAc-, were bactericidal for strain C11, whereas only those reactive with OAc- were able to kill strain MC19.\r"

Children received one dose of vaccine containing 950 pfu, whereas adults received two doses of 2500 pfu. After one year, the antibody titers of adult vaccinees to whole VZV and to gpI were significantly higher than those of children. Antibody titers to whole VZV, gpI, and p170 were lower among both vaccine populations than titers in naturally immune individuals, but vaccinees who seroconverted initially retained detectable VZV antibodies. Using T lymphocyte proliferation to measure cellular immunity, we found the mean (+/- SE) transformation index to whole VZV antigen to be 4.1 +/- 0.96 in children tested at one year, a mean significantly lower than the mean of 12.7 +/- 3.39 in adults and 13.0 +/- 1.67 in naturally immune subjects.

Studies of the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of alveolar macrophages from smokers and nonsmokers have yielded conflicting results. We tested whether alveolar macrophages from normal nonsmokers versus normal smokers differed in their ability to phagocytose and to kill the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. No significant differences in phagocytosis between nonsmokers and smokers were found. The alveolar macrophages from nonsmokers, however, killed Listeria, whereas those from smokers had no bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Thus, these data demonstrate that alveolar macrophages from normal smokers are able to phagocytose Listeria but express a selective functional deficiency in their ability to kill this facultative intracellular bacteria and, therefore, imply a defect in the immunoregulation of alveolar macrophages in smokers.\r"

Histological studies confirmed significant numbers of mast cells in both RA and OA synovium. Electron microscopic data support the morphologic similarity between human synovial mast cells and human mast cells in lung and intestine. Likewise, synovial mast cells do not appear to be functionally different from pulmonary or intestinal mucosal mast cells. Mast cell suspensions with a cellular histamine content of 4.3 +/- 0.5 pg/cell (mean +/- SEM) released histamine following provocation with anti-IgE and calcium ionophore but not compound 48/80, f-met peptide or bradykinin. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) were also released in response to anti-IgE. Auranofin inhibited anti-IgE provoked histamine, PGD2 and LTC4 release while gold sodium thiomalate, cromolyn and indomethacin had no effect on histamine release. Theophylline inhibited anti-IgE induced histamine release only at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-3) M. Our study argues against functional or morphologic mast cell heterogeneity of human intestinal, lung and synovial origin and suggests that mast cells may have a pathogenic role in both RA and OA.\r"

Rats underwent 60 minutes of renal ischemia and were studied after either 24 hours (inulin clearance) or 15 minutes (renal malondialdehyde content) of reperfusion. Infusion of the iron chelator deferoxamine (200 mg/kg/hr) during the first 60 minutes of reperfusion resulted in a marked improvement in renal function (inulin clearance: 879 +/- 154 vs. 314 +/- 74 microliter/min; P less than 0.025) and a reduction in lipid peroxidation (renal malondialdehyde: 0.449 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.698 +/- 0.08 mmol/mg prot; P less than 0.05) compared to control animals. Infusion of 50 mg/kg/hr deferoxamine also protected renal function after ischemia (inulin clearance: 624 +/- 116 vs. 285 +/- 90 microliter/min; P less than 0.05) and resulted in less histologic injury. Iron-saturated deferoxamine had no protective effect. Conversely, infusion of the iron complex EDTA-FeCl3 during reperfusion exacerbated postischemic renal dysfunction and lipid peroxidation. Following renal ischemia there was no detectable increase in \"free\" iron in arterial or renal venous plasma. However, urinary \"free\" iron increased 10- to 20-fold following reperfusion. Iron chelators which underwent filtration and gained access to this free iron in the urine (free deferoxamine or inulin-conjugated deferoxamine) provided protection, whereas a chelator confined to the vascular space (dextran-conjugated deferoxamine) did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of the participation of iron in biological systems to generate hydroxyl radical, we also examined the effect of deferoxamine (DFO, 30 mg/day), an iron chelator, on the PAN-induced proteinuria. Concurrent administration of DFO was also protective. In a second series of experiments, DMTU and DFO (administered as described above and then for two additional days after the PAN) provided marked protection even when they were stopped prior to the onset of proteinuria.

  ".W": "Valproate is an antiepileptic drug known to induce hyperammonemia in humans. This hyperammonemia might result from a reduced detoxification of ammonium in the liver and/or from an accelerated renal ammoniagenesis. Six dogs with normal acid-base equilibrium and eight dogs with chronic metabolic acidosis were infused with valproate directly into their left renal artery in order to obtain arterial concentrations around 3 to 4 mM. The arterial ammonium concentration rose only in chronically acidotic dogs, whereas the lactate concentration and the lactate/pyruvate ratio increased in both groups. The urinary excretion of lactate and pyruvate increased markedly but the urinary excretion of other relevant metabolites remained minimal. Renal glutamine utilization and ammonium production were not changed by valproate administration in normal dogs but increased modestly in acidotic dogs. However, renal lactate utilization was drastically reduced and in fact, changed into a net production of lactate. Valproate strikingly reduced the renal cortical concentrations of glutamine, glutamate, alphaketoglutarate and citrate, and more modestly those of malate, oxaloacetate, aspartate, alanine and ATP. By contrast, the tissue lactate concentration and the lactate/pyruvate ratio were markedly increased. In experiments with brush border membrane vesicles, valproate inhibited the lactate transporter. These results suggest that high concentrations of valproate drastically inhibited the proximal reabsorption and the proximal and distal oxidation of lactate and pyruvate. Valproate probably became itself a significant energetic substrate for the kidney.\r"

In the cortical collecting duct (CCD), rod-shaped particles, which are abundant in intercalated cells were observed in both the apical and basolateral membrane of all intercalated cells examined. In the outer stripe of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCDo) a high density of rod-shaped particles was found only in the apical membrane of intercalated cells. All cells of the inner stripe of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCDi) had rod-shaped particles in the apical membrane but not in the basolateral membrane. As the collecting duct entered the inner medulla the density of rod-shaped particles decreased until they were virtually absent in the terminal segment. Na-K-ATPase, localized to the basolateral membrane, was more abundant in principal cells than in intercalated cells in the CCD. In the OMCDo, staining was equal in principal and intercalated cells. All cells of the OMCDi and the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) stained for Na-K-ATPase. Carbonic anhydrase in the CCD was localized to the cell membranes and cytoplasm of intercalated cells. Principal cells did not stain for carbonic anhydrase. A similar pattern was seen in the OMCDo. In the outer region of the OMCDi most cells did not stain for carbonic anhydrase, whereas in the inner region the apical and lateral membranes of all cells stained for carbonic anhydrase. Weak cytoplasmic staining was occasionally seen. A similar pattern was seen in the initial half of the IMCD, while the terminal half of the IMCD did not stain. In this study, the localization of enzymes and rod-shaped intramembranous particles associated with Na+, K+, and H+ transport shows both segmental and cellular heterogeneity, and correlates with the known transport properties of tubule segments. The distribution of these enzymes and rod-shaped intramembranous particles is different in rabbits and rats, and may explain some of the functional differences between homologous segments in these species.\r"

The hypertensive ADPKD patients exhibited an increased renal vascular resistance as compared to the normotensive patients in spite of comparable glomerular filtration rates. It is hypothesized that the renal involvement of hypertensive ADPKD patients causes an impaired renal response to the observed increase in cardiac index, and also may release a venoconstrictor (such as angiotensin) which contributes to the enhanced cardiac pre-load and thus the hypertension.\r"

In 19 healthy subjects a) and c) were also evaluated. RBC Na,K pump activity was lower in uremic patients than in normal subjects (P less than 0.0005), and lower in hypertensive (P less than 0.02) than in normotensive patients. Serum from uremic patients inhibited ouabain-sensitive Na efflux in normal RBC, the inhibition being correlated with both the rate constant for ouabain-sensitive Na efflux (r = -0.67; P less than 0.005) and [Nai] (r = 0.43; P less than 0.05) of RBC of patients from whom the serum was obtained. Inhibition of ouabain-sensitive Na efflux was significantly higher with serum from hypertensive than from normotensive patients (P less than 0.05). Serum digoxin-like immunoreactivity was present in all uremic patients (0.402 +/- 0.054 ng/ml in normotensive and 0.428 +/- 0.040 ng/ml in hypertensive, P = ns), while it was not detectable in normal subjects. Hypertensive patients had peripheral resistance significantly higher than normotensive (P less than 0.05), while cardiac index was similar in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immunoglobulin G excretion increased proportionally to albumin excretion. Hematocrit and serum albumin concentration increased after ANP. In each patient the percent reduction of plasma volume calculated from the effect on serum albumin was smaller than the hemoconcentration calculated from the effect on hematocrit, suggesting a loss of albumin from the intravascular compartment. This could not be accounted for by the increased glomerular filtration of albumin. Blood pressure and effective renal plasma flow decreased and filtration fraction increased after ANP. Plasma renin was suppressed at lower doses of ANP but was stimulated, together with plasma noradrenaline, at higher doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In stable ambulatory patients, an abnormal sensitive TSH value is strongly suggestive of clinical or subclinical thyroid hormone excess or deficiency, which can be confirmed by a free thyroxine (T4) index (FT4I) and evaluation for antimicrosomal antibody (AMA) as a marker of autoimmune thyroid disease. In a hospitalized patient, an abnormality in sensitive TSH or FT4I does not necessarily indicate a thyroid problem but may merely reflect a nonthyroidal illness or glucocorticoid or dopamine treatment. A thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test may be needed to diagnose hyperthyroidism in a hospitalized patient with a basal sensitive TSH level of less than 0.1 microU/ml because a detectable TRH response contraindicates hyperthyroidism whereas hyperthyroid patients with nonthyroidal illness have the expected absent response. In a hospitalized patient, hypothyroidism must be diagnosed on the basis of both a high TSH level and a low FT4I because an isolated high TSH value may merely reflect the recovery phase of a nonthyroidal illness. No clinical urgency exists for establishing a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism in a hospitalized patient; definitive determination of thyroid status can be deferred until recovery and discharge.\r"

  ".W": "The anterior body pattern of Drosophila melanogaster is specified in large part by the protein product of the bicoid (bcd) gene which functions as a graded morphogen with its peak of expression at the anterior pole of the embryo. Formation of the gradient is dependent on prior localization of bcd messenger RNA at the anterior pole of the egg cell during oogenesis. Here we demonstrate that a discrete portion of the bcd mRNA is necessary for anterior localization of the bcd transcript and is sufficient to cause localization of heterologous transcripts. The sequences responsible for localization appear to span an interval of about 625 base pairs in the 3' untranslated portion of the bcd mRNA and to include regions capable of forming extensive secondary structure. Transcripts from bcd are synthesized predominantly, if not exclusively, in the nurse cells and then transported to the oocyte by connections at the prospective anterior pole. Our findings support the proposal that bcd transcripts are selectively recognized and trapped as they enter the anterior tip of the oocyte, and suggest that this localization process is mediated by anchored sequence-specific receptors in the oocyte cytoplasm.\r"

  ".W": "Homoeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster are active in spatially restricted metameric domains and control the morphogenesis of segment-specific features such as legs or wings within these domains. They exert their function, according to the 'selector gene' hypothesis, by regulating the expression of subordinate genes. Homoeotic genes also control their own expression and the expression of each other. The proteins encoded by these genes contain a domain, called a homoeodomain, that is strongly conserved, and that shows homologies to proteins that bind DNA and regulate transcription. Homoeoproteins have been shown to bind specific DNA sequences. We show here that the Drosophila homoeotic genes Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) code for proteins that are capable of activating transcription of reporter genes linked to specific cis-regulatory target sequences in transfected mammalian cells. Their activity, as well as their target specificity, is similar to that of a mammalian lymphoid-specific octamer transcription factor, OTF-2, which was recently found to contain a homoeodomain.\r"

Among other functions, purified preparations activate K+ channels but there is confusion over which of the subtypes activates the muscarinic K+ channels of the atrial muscle of the heart: Gi alpha-3, also termed Gk, has been shown to activate this channel but it is not clear whether Gi alpha-1 does or does not. To clarify this problem, we expressed the subtypes separately in Escherichia coli to eliminate contamination by other subtypes and tested the recombinant alpha- chains on atrial muscarinic K+ channels. Although we anticipated that only Gi alpha-3 would have Gk activity, to our surprise all three recombinant subtypes were active, from which we deduce that the Gi subtypes are multifunctional.\r"

They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified hematopoietic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells and leukaemia inhibitory factor. DIA and human interleukin DA/leukaemia inhibitory factor have thus been identified as related multifunctional regulatory factors with distinct biological activities in both early embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell systems.\r"

  ".W": "Gene expression is modulated by the specific interactions of nuclear proteins with unique regulatory sequences in the genome. Proteins involved in transcriptional regulation seem to be either transcription factors or transcription modulators and their interactions are crucial in determining whether the expression of a specific gene is activated or repressed. Recently, the product of the proto-oncogene jun has been identified as the transcription factor AP-1, whereas nuclear oncoproteins fos and myc have been implicated in transcriptional transregulation of several promoters. Furthermore, the products of the fos and jun proto-oncogenes are associated in some transcription complexes. Although the nature of the association is unclear, the two proteins co-immunoprecipitate with fos antibodies in nuclear extracts. Here, we report studies that demonstrate that the fos protein directly modulates jun function by means of a heterodimer of fos and jun proteins. The fos 'leucine zipper' domain is necessary for the DNA binding of the heterodimer; a distinct domain, localized in the C-terminal region of the fos protein, is responsible for transcriptional regulation.\r"

  ".U": "89070824\r", 
  ".W": "This report concerns the clinicopathological features of 39 cases of a morphologically unique and surgically curable group of neuroepithelial tumors associated with medically intractable partial complex seizures. All were supratentorial and characterized by intracortical location, multinodular architecture, and heterogeneity in cellular composition. The constituent cells included astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Because neuronal atypia was often inapparent, the tumors superficially resembled mixed oligoastrocytomas. The term \"dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor\" (DNT) is proposed for these distinctive lesions, the clinicopathological features of which suggest a dysembryoplastic origin. With the exception of the occurrence of headaches in 2 patients, partial complex seizures were the exclusive symptom. Age at onset of symptoms ranged from 1 to 19 years (mean 9 years). In addition to the chronic nature of the seizures (range, 2 to 18 years; mean, 9 years), one-third of the patients showed radiological features, such as focal cranial deformity, indicating that the tumors had an early onset and were of long standing. In most cases, computed tomography showed a \"pseudocystic,\" well-demarcated, low density appearance associated in some cases with focal contrast enhancement (18%) or calcific hyperdensity (23%). The tumor involved the temporal lobe in 24 patients (62%), the frontal lobe in 12 (31%), and the parietal and/or occipital lobe in 3 cases. Although tumor removal was considered incomplete or subtotal in 17 patients (44%), long term follow-up (range, 1 to 18 years; mean, 9 years) showed neither clinical nor radiological evidence of recurrence in any patient. Comparison of the survival data of the 13 subjects who had undergone postoperative radiotherapy with 26 who had not indicated that radiation therapy was of no obvious benefit. The identification of DNT has therapeutic and prognostic implications because aggressive therapy can be avoided, thus sparing these young patients the deleterious long term effects of radio- or chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Vinculin- and caldesmon-immunoreactive forms and actin isoform patterns were studied in samples of normal and atherosclerotic human aorta. After removal of adventitia and endothelium, the remaining tissue was divided into three layers: media, muscular-elastic (adjacent to media) intima, and subendothelial (juxtaluminal) intima. In media of normal aorta, meta-vinculin accounted for 41.0 +/- 0.9% (mean +/- SEM) of total immunoreactive vinculin (meta-vinculin + vinculin); 150-kDa caldesmon accounted for 78.2 +/- 5.1% of immunoreactive caldesmon (150-kDa + 70-kDa); the fractional contents of alpha-smooth muscle actin, beta-nonmuscle, and gamma-isoactins were 49.0 +/- 0.6%, 30.4 +/- 0.6%, and 20.8 +/- 0.8%, respectively. Muscular-elastic intima was very similar to media by these criteria. In subendothelial intima, the fractional content of meta-vinculin and 150-kDa caldesmon was significantly lower (6.9 +/- 1.5% and 32.7 +/- 7.0%, respectively) than in muscular-elastic intima and media, whereas the isoactin pattern was identical to that in adjacent layers, demonstrating the smooth muscle origin of subendothelial intima cells. In atherosclerotic fibrous plaque, the fractional content of alpha-actin was decreased in subendothelial intima, rather than in media and muscular-elastic intima. Additionally, the proportion of subendothelial intima cells [i.e., the cells that express low amounts of smooth muscle phenotype markers (meta-vinculin, 150-kDa caldesmon, and alpha-actin)] in the total intima cell population increased dramatically in atherosclerotic fibrous plaque. The results suggest that changes in the relative content of meta-vinculin and 150-kDa caldesmon as well as alpha-actin in human aortic intima are associated with atherosclerosis although, in subendothelial intima of normal aorta, a certain smooth muscle cell population exists that expresses reduced amounts of \"contractile\" phenotype markers, even in the absence of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Epithelial cells are organized into either a single layer (simple epithelia) or multiple layers (stratified epithelia). Maintenance of these cellular organizations requires distinct adhesive mechanisms involving many cell surface molecules. One such molecule is a cell surface proteoglycan, named syndecan, that contains both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. This proteoglycan binds cells to fibrillar collagens and fibronectin and thus acts as a receptor for interstitial matrix. The proteoglycan is restricted to the basolateral surface of simple epithelial cells, but is located over the entire surface of stratified epithelial cells, even those surfaces not contacting matrix. We now show that the distinct localization in simple and stratified epithelia correlates with a distinct proteoglycan structure. The proteoglycan from simple epithelia (modal molecular size, 160 kDa) is larger than that from stratified epithelia (modal molecular size, 92 kDa), but their core proteins are identical in size and immunoreactivity. The proteoglycan from simple epithelia has more and larger heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains than the proteoglycan from stratified epithelia. Thus, the cell surface proteoglycan shows a tissue-specific structural polymorphism due to distinct posttranslational modifications. This polymorphism likely reflects distinct proteoglycan functions in simple and stratified epithelia, potentially meeting the different adhesive requirements of the cells in these different organizations.\r"

The severities of these defects were proportional to the level of antisense rpA1 expression. Anti-rpA1 expression did not affect larval or pupal development.

  ".W": "T cells are activated physiologically by triggering the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. There is evidence that invariant accessory molecules on the T-cell membrane (CD8 and CD4) are involved in the major histocompatibility complex-restricted recognition process. Moreover, binding and crosslinking of these accessory molecules to the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex exerts a positive synergistic signal, as has been shown by stimulation with crosslinked antibodies. Here we demonstrate that stimulation mediated by immobilized anti-CD3/CD8 antibodies differs from stimulation mediated solely by anti-CD3. Whereas interleukin 2 receptor expression and interferon gamma production are seen to a similar extent in both cases, a second signal provided by the additional involvement of CD8 seems to be essential for interleukin 2 production and full interleukin 2 responsiveness in CD8+ T cells. This second signal is much more sensitive to inhibition by 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and cGMP/cAMP-dependent kinases. Our results also show that substantial modulation of the T-cell receptor complex and most likely CD3 phosphorylation are not essential for initiating the activation of resting T cells. Instead, we found a 22- to 24-kDa phosphoprotein whose strong phosphorylation correlated reliably with T-cell activation.\r"

T-cell precursors and occasional gamma delta-expressing T cells in humans possess an unexpected 2.0-kilobase (kb) mRNA in which a tandemly repeated motif, TEA (T early alpha), has been spliced to the constant (C alpha) region. Long-range pulsed-field gel mapping as well as molecular cloning showed that TEA is located immediately 5' to the most upstream joining (J alpha) segment of the TCR alpha-chain locus. The TCR delta-chain locus is immediately 5' to TEA, and diversity (D delta) gene segments, J delta, C delta, and TEA are linked within 35 kb. The human TCR delta locus conserves a 12/23-base-pair (bp) spacer paradigm in which J delta possesses a 12-bp and V delta a 23-bp spacer, while the D delta segments have a 12 bp-D delta-23 bp spacer motif. Considerable TCR delta diversity can be generated despite the predominant use of one V delta and one J delta segment. Two D delta segments, D delta 1 and D delta 2, are 9 and 13 bp long, are frequently recombined as D delta 1-D delta 2, and reveal exonucleolytic trimming with extensive N-segment addition. A gamma delta clonal T cell possessed an effective VDDJ delta rearrangement and an intermediate DDJ delta rearrangement, arguing that the TCR delta locus displays allelic exclusion. Specific rearranging elements that delete the delta locus, delta Rec and psi J alpha, were mapped and found to separate the delta locus from the alpha locus. The delta locus including D delta 1-D delta 2-J delta 1-C delta-TEA was deleted in mature, alpha beta-expressing T cells, whereas V delta 1 was frequently retained. The location of the delta locus within the alpha locus may necessitate an exclusive choice between delta or alpha expression.\r"

The genomic structure of the human locus closely parallels its mouse counterpart. Several cDNA sequences and a series of rearranged genomic sequences are compared which demonstrate an enormous potential diversity in the junctional region, between the variable region and the joining region. We find the predominant utilization of the PEER variable region in thymic polyclonal gamma delta cell lines and in some peripheral blood gamma delta cell lines. Thus, the delta chain may have relatively limited variable-region diversity but a large junctional-region diversity. The implications of this observation are discussed.\r"

The rearrangement of the T-cell receptor variable region gamma chain gene segment V gamma 4, a component of the gamma-chain gene that is rearranged and expressed preferentially on thymocytes of normal adult mice, is severely repressed in beta transgenic mice. Consequently no gamma delta T-cell receptor heterodimers are detectable on the surface of adult thymocytes or splenic T cells. These results indicate that cells expressing alpha beta or gamma (V gamma 4)-delta TCRs originate from a common precursor in which the first productive rearrangement of either the beta or gamma locus determines the further differentiation pathway into either alpha beta or gamma delta T cells. The repression of V gamma 4 rearrangement by a preexisting beta-chain gene may be indicative of one of several mechanisms which ensure that gamma delta and alpha beta receptors do not as a rule appear on the surface of the same cell.\r"

In murine helper (CD4+) T-cell clones IL-4 production appears to be regulated independently of interferon gamma and interleukin 2. To determine whether production of these lymphokines is also differentially regulated in uncloned human T cells, we studied lymphokine production by normal human peripheral T cells and T-cell subsets after in vitro polyclonal activation. After maximal induction of lymphokine expression, IL-4 mRNA was detectable in less than 5% of CD4+ and 1-2% of unfractionated T cells, whereas approximately 33% and 60% of CD4+ cells expressed detectable mRNA for interferon gamma and interleukin 2, respectively. This finding correlated with dramatically lower production of IL-4 mRNA and protein than of interferon gamma and interleukin 2 by peripheral blood and tonsillar T cells. The helper-inducer (CD4+ CD45R-) T-cell subset, which significantly enhances in vitro immunoglobulin production, accounted for the preponderance of IL-4 mRNA accumulation and protein production by CD4+ T cells; nevertheless, cells with detectable IL-4 mRNA constituted less than 10% of the CD4+ CD45R- subset. Limitation of IL-4 production to a comparatively small population of normal human T cells could selectively regulate the effects of this lymphokine in T-cell-mediated immune responses; such selective regulation may be a fundamental mechanism for restricting the potentially pleiotropic effects of certain lymphokines to appropriate responder cells.\r"

The prion protein (PrP) is found in amyloid of animals with scrapie and humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; the beta protein is present in amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome patients. These two proteins are derived from precursors that in the brain are expressed primarily in neurons and are membrane bound. We found that gene expression for PrP and the beta-protein precursor (beta-PP) is regulated in developing hamster brain. Specific brain regions showed distinct patterns of ontogenesis for PrP and beta-PP mRNAs. The increases in PrP and beta-PP mRNAs in developing basal forebrain coincided with an increase in choline acetyltransferase activity, raising the possibility that these markers might be coordinately controlled in cholinergic neurons and regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF). Injections of NGF into the brains of neonatal hamsters increased both PrP and beta-PP mRNA levels. Increased PrP and beta-PP mRNA levels induced by NGF were confined to regions that contain NGF-responsive cholinergic neurons and were accompanied by elevations in choline acetyltransferase. It remains to be established whether or not exogenous NGF acts to increase PrP and beta-PP gene expression selectively in forebrain cholinergic neurons in the developing hamster and endogenous NGF regulates expression of these genes.\r"

A four-step purification was achieved that used (i) hydroxylapatite chromatography, (ii and iii) affinity chromatographies on ADP-agarose and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose columns, and (iv) a final chromatographic step on a mixture of AMP-agarose/GMP-agarose/hydroxylapatite. This procedure led to a 2500-fold purification. NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified material in reducing and nonreducing conditions showed that the sulfonylurea-binding component is made of a single major polypeptide chain of Mr 150,000 +/- 10,000. Direct photoaffinity labeling of the receptor with [3H]glibenclamide at different steps of the purification also showed that radioactivity was specifically incorporated into a polypeptide of Mr 150,000 +/- 5000, thus confirming the subunit structure indicated by the purification.\r"

The major strides made in the field of surgery to today's level of sophistication are to a large extent the result of vast technological advancements that have been made. It behooves the user of this surgical equipment to follow the simplest precautionary rules of operation and to be completely au fait with the workings of the equipment. In this way, many injuries can be prevented. In many cases, the surgeon must bear the ultimate responsibility for injury.\r"

Clathrin-coated vesicles have also been implicated in protein export but definition of their precise role has been controversial. Recent advances in characterization of the clathrin subunits and additional coated vesicle components have identified molecular interactions involved in clathrin polymerization and coated vesicle formation, and have provided new approaches to investigating its function. These studies suggest that clathrin's role, in both inward and outward membrane traffic, is to facilitate receptor transport by a concentration and sorting process that initiates targeting to specific intracellular compartments.\r"

The xisA gene, located on the nifD 11-kilobase DNA element, was inactivated by recombination between the chromosome and a copy of the xisA gene that was mutated by inserting an antibiotic gene cassette. Site-directed inactivation of the Anabaena xisA gene blocked rearrangement of the 11-kilobase element and nitrogen fixation, but did not affect rearrangement of the 55-kilobase element, heterocyst differentiation, or heterocyst pattern formation.\r"

The ability of Go, the predominant G protein in the brain, to stimulate potassium channels was tested in cell-free membrane patches of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Four distinct types of potassium channels, which were otherwise quiescent, were activated by both isolated brain G0 and recombinant Go alpha. Hence brain Go can couple diverse brain potassium channels to neurotransmitter receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The fidelity of protein biosynthesis in any cell rests on the accuracy of aminoacylation of tRNA. The exquisite specificity of this reaction is critically dependent on the correct recognition of tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. It is shown here that the relative concentrations of a tRNA and its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are normally well balanced and crucial for maintenance of accurate aminoacylation. When Escherichia coli Gln-tRNA synthetase is overproduced in vivo, it incorrectly acylates the supF amber suppressor tRNA(Tyr) with Gln. This effect is abolished when the intracellular concentration of the cognate tRNA(Gln2) is also elevate. These data indicate that the presence of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and the cognate tRNAs in complexed form, which requires the proper balance of the two macromolecules, is critical in maintaining the fidelity of protein biosynthesis. Thus, limits exist on the relative levels of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases within a cell.\r"
