  ".W": "Experiments were designed to examine the effects of pregnancy on gastric emptying and on the in vitro contractile response of gastric smooth muscle to cholinergic stimulation. Gastric emptying of a radio-labeled liquid marker (51Cr in saline) was determined at regular intervals (5, 15, 30, and 60 min) in nonpregnant and pregnant (third trimester) guinea pigs. Gastric emptying after 30 min also was determined for animals 1 and 4 days postpartum. The in vitro contractile responses of muscle strips from the fundus, corpus, and antrum of nonpregnant and pregnant animals after stimulation with acetylcholine were analyzed with respect to the maximal force developed and the pD2 value (negative logarithm of the dose that gives a one-half maximal response). The results can be summarized as follows. Pregnancy was characterized by an increase in the amount of marker retained within the stomach at each time point. For nonpregnant animals the time to one-half emptying was approximately 10 min; in pregnant animals this was prolonged to 30 min. Gastric emptying was reduced in animals 1-day postpartum but returned to normal by 4 days after delivery. In contrast, pregnancy had no effect on the maximal contractile response to acetylcholine of muscle strips from the orad and caudad stomach or on their respective pD2 values. The results suggest that pregnancy is associated with decreased gastric emptying of liquids in the guinea pig, but that the delay cannot be attributed to alterations in the maximal force-generating capacity of gastric smooth muscle.\r"

The mortality rate and degree of hyperamylasemia associated with this model of pancreatitis were reduced by catalase but a similar result followed the administration of heat-denatured catalase, suggesting that the apparent protective effect of catalase was not the result of reductions in free radical levels. Neither allopurinol nor dimethylsulfoxide reduced mortality or degree of hyperamylasemia. The increased pancreatic content of amylase and the necrosis that characterize this model of pancreatitis were not altered by any of the agents tested. In contrast, both allopurinol and dimethylsulfoxide reduced peripancreatic edema formation, suggesting that edema, but not the other features that characterize this model of pancreatitis, may result from generation of oxygen-derived free radicals.\r"

The fasting levels of H2 in untreated celiac patients (mean 22.5 +/- 19.3 ppm) were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers (5.8 +/- 3.1 ppm), patients with functional bowel disorders (6.6 +/- 4.4 ppm), treated celiac patients (9.9 +/- 8.1 ppm), and disease controls (7.0 +/- 6.7 ppm). No significant difference was found between patients with untreated celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth (mean 14.7 +/- 14.0 ppm). The percentage of patients with elevated H2 fasting levels in untreated celiac disease (58.8%) was significantly higher than that in the other groups, except for the patients with bacterial overgrowth (43.7%). In 14 celiac patients, studied before and after a gluten-free diet, fasting H2 levels decreased from 26.6 +/- 18 to 11.6 +/- 10 ppm, becoming normal only in those patients with healing of intestinal lesions. Our results show that high fasting H2 levels are a frequent feature of untreated celiac disease and that the return to normal of these levels is predictive of villous regrowth.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of a 1200-mg oral dose of cimetidine in 9 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome requiring more than 2.4 g/day of cimetidine with 5 age-matched normal volunteers receiving intravenous pentagastrin infusions. Poor responsiveness to cimetidine in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has several different causes. The concentration of cimetidine in the blood required to inhibit gastric acid secretion by 50% was markedly increased in 3 of the patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, suggesting parietal cell resistance. One patient showed a substantial decrease in cimetidine absorption and 4 patients had delayed cimetidine absorption. Thus 7 of the 9 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who required more than 2.4 g/day of cimetidine to inhibit gastric acid secretion had abnormal cimetidine pharmacokinetics.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term esophageal pH-metry has become the preferred test to quantify acid gastroesophageal reflux, but its accuracy in separating physiologic from pathological reflux is not well defined. To establish optimal thresholds of 24-h pH-metry, we studied 45 patients with clinically proven gastroesophageal reflux disease and 42 healthy volunteers. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH was measured while the subject was ambulatory, using a combined glass electrode connected to a portable recorder. Percentage of time with esophageal pH less than 4, the number and mean duration of reflux episodes, the number of episodes lasting longer than 5 min, and the duration of the longest episode were calculated for periods of upright and supine body position, respectively. Discriminant analysis and receiver-operating-characteristic analysis were used to define optimal thresholds. A maximum of sensitivity (93.3%) and specificity (92.9%) was obtained using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis with the following criteria. Only percentage of time with esophageal pH less than 4 is considered. A subject is classified as \"normal\" if both values for the upright and supine body position are below the thresholds, otherwise the subject is classified as \"pathological.\" The thresholds are 10.5% of time with esophageal pH less than 4 for the upright position and 6.0% for the supine position. Within the limits of this retrospective study, it is concluded that rather simple criteria yield a high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of long-term esophageal pH-metry. Nevertheless, a prospective and independent confirmation of these criteria is needed.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the central and autonomic nervous system might be involved in the control of intestinal absorption was assessed by measuring the effect of psychological stress, induced by dichotomous listening, on jejunal transport in 15 healthy subjects. Using a triple-lumen perfusion technique to determine jejunal absorption, dichotomous listening significantly reduced mean net water absorption from 31.2 to 8.7 ml X 30 cm-1 X h-1 (p less than 0.005) and changed mean net sodium and chloride absorption to secretion (sodium +1.14 to -1.2 mEq X 30 cm-1 X h-1, p less than 0.01; and chloride +1.5 to -0.9 mEq X 30 cm-1 X h-1, p less than 0.02). During the hour following dichotomous listening these changes were maintained. Jejunal water, sodium, and chloride absorption measured in 9 subjects during three consecutive stress-free periods did not change significantly. Mean transit time over the 30-cm test segment, measured by a dye dilution technique, in 7 subjects was not significantly different during control and dichotomous listening periods, being 2.8 and 4.0 min, respectively. During the hour following dichotomous listening there was a significant increase in mean transit time to 6.4 min (p less than 0.02). In 7 subjects who received a constant intravenous infusion of atropine throughout the control, dichotomous listening, and recovery periods, jejunal sodium, chloride, and water absorption did not change significantly. These results suggest that psychological stress can influence jejunal absorption of salt and water and that this effect may be mediated by a cholinergic parasympathetic nervous mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "87219744\r", 
  ".W": "The goal of this study was to identify the structural and compositional features of human gallstones that influence in vitro gallstone dissolution in the cholesterol solvent monooctanoin. Gallstones were obtained from 86 consecutive patients who had at least three morphologically similar stones. One stone from each patient was dissolved in ethanol/ether to determine cholesterol and matrix composition. The remaining two matched stones were dissolved in either monooctanoin plus ethanol (n = 86) or monooctanoin plus 2-mercaptoethanol (n = 86). The thiol reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol has been previously shown to solubilize the isolated gallstone matrix and to accelerate the dissolution of intact, small cholesterol stones. Stone matrix content and initial diameter had the most significant predictive value for stone dissolution (p less than 0.0001 for each), whereas cholesterol content had no predictive value (p = 0.558). Stones incubated in monooctanoin containing 2-mercaptoethanol dissolved more rapidly than those incubated in monooctanoin plus ethanol (16.7% of initial weight per day vs. 13.8% of initial weight per day, p less than 0.0001). Matrix content correlated significantly with the difference in dissolution rate between stones dissolved in monooctanoin plus ethanol or monooctanoin plus 2-mercaptoethanol (p less than 0.0001). These data indicate that the matrix content of human cholesterol gallstones significantly inhibits in vitro stone dissolution in the cholesterol solvent monooctanoin. This finding may be relevant to the clinical dissolution of gallstones.\r"

The results were compared with results from similar interviews of an age and sex matched control group of 75 previously healthy patients admitted to the hospital for acute diseases of less than 28 days' duration. An equal percentage of the patients and the controls were married (67% vs 71%) and had become parents (68% vs 79%). The number of children was slightly lower among Crohn's disease patients. The occurrence of familial problems and sexual problems did not differ among patients and controls. The intake of sedatives was low in both groups and no difference was found in alcohol and tobacco intake between patients and controls. A combined score for social activities comprising cultural, sporting, educational and private social arrangements showed that about one-third of patients and controls had high social activity and about half of both groups had moderately high social activity. A similar physical activity score showed no difference between the two groups. The socioeconomic level of the Crohn's disease patients was slightly, but significantly higher than that of the controls. Sixty five per cent of Crohn's disease patients were employed, 64% of controls; 6% and 7% respectively unemployed. Three per cent of Crohn's disease patients had disablement pension. Of Crohn's disease patients employed, a higher percentage (77%) had remained in the same job for more than five years (64% of controls).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Utilising the population based data resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we determined the incidence and prevalence of chronic ulcerative colitis among Rochester, Minnesota, residents over the 20 year period, 1960-79. One hundred and thirty eight cases met diagnostic and residency criteria, for an overall age, and sex adjusted chronic ulcerative colitis incidence rate of 15.0 per 100,000 person years. The male:female ratio of age adjusted rates was 1.5:1. Age specific incidence was roughly bimodal in appearance but was not consistent in different patient subgroups. On 1-1-80, there were 120 Rochester residents with a history of chronic ulcerative colitis, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 225.2 per 100,000 population. Fifty three per cent of chronic ulcerative colitis incidence cases were 'definite' and 47% were 'probable', the former requiring consistent observations for at least six months. The definite group had proportionately more men and disease of greater extent and severity. Pancolitis comprised about one-third of all cases (4.6 per 100,000 person years). Proctitis and distal disease (7.1 and 2.0 per 100,000 person years) made up most of the rest. One-fourth of all patients had 'severe' or 'moderate' disease (3.8 per 100,000 person years), while the remainder had either 'mild' or 'transient' chronic ulcerative colitis (11.2 per 100,000 person years). In residents of Rochester, Minnesota, chronic ulcerative colitis is most often a mild disease. The over-representation of severe or complicated examples that results from selected referral to major centres probably distorts the natural clinical spectrum of the disease.\r"

Osteoporosis, defined as a bone mineral content greater than 2 SD below the age and sex matched normal mean value was present in 23 patients (30.6%). Three amenorrhoeic females aged 34, 38, and 42 years had severe clinical osteoporosis and a further three patients had one or more vertebral crush fractures. Eighteen of the 23 patients with osteoporosis had small intestinal disease with one or more resections and the mean lifetime steroid dose in those with osteoporosis was significantly higher than in those with normal bone mineral content. Bone mineral content in spinal trabecular bone showed significant negative correlations with lifetime steroid dose and serum alkaline phosphatase and a significant positive correlation with serum albumin. Peripheral cortical bone mineral content was positively correlated with body weight, height and body mass index. We conclude that the prevalence of osteoporosis is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, severe clinical osteoporosis developing in some relatively young patients. The pathogenesis of this bone loss is probably multifactorial; steroid therapy is likely to be an important contributory factor.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients exhibited normal chemotaxis. For control patients with non-malignant, non-inflammatory intestinal disease, the chemotaxis of mucosal mononuclear cells was similar to that of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The chemotactic migration of mucosal mononuclear cells, however, isolated distant from a colon cancer was less than that of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Chemotactic migration was progressively impaired with increasing closeness to the tumour itself. Chemotaxis of mucosal mononuclear cell was independent of the site of tumour and the Dukes' grading. Mononuclear cells from mesenteric lymph nodes, however, exhibited impaired migration only in patients with Dukes' C tumours. Supernatants of the collagenase digestion of either tumour or adjacent mucosa contained macrophage directed inhibitors of chemotaxis and these inhibitors were not produced by tumour mononuclear cells. The presence of such inhibitors in the digestion supernatants and the demonstration that proximity to the tumour was associated with impaired mononuclear cell motility suggest that the production of macrophage directed chemotactic inhibitors is by colon cancer cells and that this may be occurring in vivo.\r"

Experience with a further 35 patients is reported giving a total group of 50. This group was divided into classical cases, atypical cases and cases exhibiting significant psychopathology. The response rates were 95%, 43%, and 60% respectively. Patients over the age of 50 years responded very poorly (25%) whereas those below the age of 50 with classical irritable bowel syndrome exhibited a 100% response rate. This study confirms the successful effect of hypnotherapy in a larger series of patients with irritable bowel syndrome and defines some subgroup variations.\r"

The absorption step of folic acid was identical in the two groups, while deconjugation of pteroyl-L-glutamyl-gamma-L-glutamyl-gamma-L-glutamic acid was significantly decreased in the patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. This observation suggests a primary epithelial defect of the small intestine in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis.\r"

Plasma oestrone (E1), oestradiol-17 beta (E2), 4-androstenedione (A), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT), total and free testosterone (T and free T), binding capacity of sex hormone binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, urinary total E1, E2, and oestriol (E3), and oestriol-3-glucuronide (E3-3G) and faecal unconjugated and conjugated E1, E2, and E3 were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Treatment with the antibiotic significantly increased the excretion of faecal conjugated oestrogens, which parallelled a decrease in urinary oestrogen excretion, especially of E3. The effect on urinary E3 could be explained almost entirely by the simultaneous decrease of urinary E3-3G concentrations. In urine and faeces the E2/E3 and E1 + E2/E3 ratios increased, probably because of the diminished reductive metabolism of oestrogens in the gut. No significant effects on plasma unconjugated oestrogen concentrations were observed. Moreover, in the present study oxytetracycline had no remarkable effect on plasma total, or free T concentrations, nor on other plasma hormones measured. Our results suggest that enterohepatic recycling and intestinal metabolism of oestrogens may be significant in men. The mechanism of action of antibiotics on oestrogen metabolism probably involves decreased hydrolysis by beta-glucuronidase of oestrogen conjugates by the intestinal contents, diminishing the reabsorption of aglycones of oestrogen conjugates and resulting in faecal loss of the steroids.\r"

As unconjugated serum bile acids have been proposed as markers for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, we studied individual unconjugated serum bile acids in 36 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. These patients had significantly higher serum concentrations of unconjugated cholic acid (median 0.18; range 0.05-30.75 v 0.09; 0.01-0.19 mumol/l, p less than 0.001) and chenodeoxycholic acid (0.10; 0.01-6.83 v 0.04; 0.01-0.39 mumol/l, p less than 0.025) than healthy controls (n = 16). This difference was mainly due to patients with diarrhoea (n = 10), who had significantly higher concentrations of unconjugated serum bile acids than patients with normal bowel habit (cholic acid median 0.55 v 0.16 mumol/l, p less than 0.001; chenodeoxycholic acid 0.75 v 0.07 mumol/l; p less than 0.005). All patients with raised unconjugated serum bile acids had oesophageal motility disorders. These results confirm a relationship between motility disorders and bacterial overgrowth in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis.\r"

Ranitidine was significantly more effective in decreasing 24 h median intragastric acidity when the drug was administered at 1800 h rather than at 2200 h. Median pH (and interquartile range) was 1.45 (1.4-1.7) on placebo, 2.55 (2.05-3.2) on ranitidine given at 2200 h and 3.35 (2.5-3.85) on ranitidine given at 1800 h (p less than 0.004). The total duration of highly acidic electrode readings (pH less than 1.5) over a 24 h period was reduced significantly by administering the H2-receptor antagonist at 1800 h compared with the later administration.

Seven prospective users of Crohn's disease activity indices were presented with 10 'cases histories' compiled from relevant patient data and asked to calculate (independently) various indices of severity and activity from this information. The results showed a disquieting degree of observer variation in all indices studied. Similar results were obtained when 15 members of the International Organisation for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) reviewed one case history and also when members independently reviewed a series of real life cases. It is suggested that each index so far proposed is open to considerable observer variation, which casts some doubt upon the validity of studies so far carried out. Clarification of indices and the use of ranking methods can, however, do much to overcome this discrepancy.\r"

The concentration of beta-endorphin in anterior pituitary, neurointermediate lobe, and plasma was determined by radioimmunoassay 15 minutes after subcutaneous injection of clonidine in 14-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Clonidine reduced the concentration of the plasma beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity in SHR and to a lesser extent in WKY. No significant changes in the concentration of beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity were observed in anterior pituitary. Clonidine increased the concentration of neurointermediate lobe beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity in SHR in a dose-related manner but did not affect the concentration in WKY. Administration of yohimbine (1 mg/kg) completely blocked the clonidine-induced increase of neurointermediate lobe beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity in SHR, while prazosin (1 mg/kg) had no effect. These data suggest that the central alpha 2-adrenergic activation increases the neurointermediate lobe concentration of beta-endorphinlike immunoreactivity in SHR by suppressing beta-endorphin release from the neurointermediate lobe into the circulation.\r"

Vascular Na+,K+-ATPase was measured as ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake in aorta incubated in buffer or plasma from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed either a high potassium, a low sodium, or a normal diet for 2 weeks. The high potassium diet significantly increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity, whereas the low sodium diet significantly decreased activity. There was no evidence of a ouabainlike factor in plasma. The increased pump activity on the high potassium diet appeared to be due to an increase in maximum activity (Vmax) of the enzyme, rather than to an increased affinity for potassium. Potentially, an increase in Na+,K+-ATPase activity could contribute to the antihypertensive effect of potassium by hyperpolarizing the cell membrane. The decrease in vascular Na+,K+-ATPase activity on a low sodium diet probably is unrelated to its depressor effect, but it may be a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining sodium balance in the animal.\r"

Cryoblockade is known to alter synaptic and axonal transmission differently at different temperatures. In this study, cooling of the hypothalamus, including the AV3V area, to the temperature known to block only synaptic function did not alter blood pressure in two different models of experimental hypertension in the rat. Cooling sufficient to block both synaptic and axonal transmission, however, reduced blood pressure elevations to near normotensive levels. Synaptic cryoblockade in the ventromedial portion of the frontal cortex lowered experimental hypertension by 21 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In normotensive controls, blood pressure was not altered by cryoblockade in either the frontal cortex or hypothalamus. Anatomical evidence provided by others shows that cells in the ventromedial frontal cortex project, in part, through the AV3V region to the brainstem cardioregulatory structures. These results indicate that neural activity arising in frontal cortex is axonally projected through the hypothalamus to maintain elevated blood pressure in experimental hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To better define the mechanisms of blood pressure control in states of catecholamine excess, we infused norepinephrine for 28 days using subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps in dogs previously instrumented for monitoring left ventricular dynamics and cardiac output. Plasma norepinephrine rose from 238 +/- 27 to 4346 +/- 952 pg/ml at 21 days, while epinephrine and dopamine levels did not change. Heart rate fell from 85 +/- 4 to 63 +/- 6 beats/min, while arterial pressure was unchanged from baseline. Total peripheral resistance rose 0.011 +/- 0.003 mm Hg/ml/min from a control value of 0.029 +/- 0.002 mm Hg/ml/min, and cardiac output decreased 1093 +/- 292 ml/min from a baseline level of 3575 +/- 156 ml/min. Since stroke volume did not change, the maintenance of arterial pressure is related to decreases in cardiac output secondary to bradycardia. Buffering mechanisms are responsible for maintenance of systemic arterial pressure because hexamethonium and atropine caused hypertension. Although left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic diameter, shortening, rate of change of pressure, velocity of myocardial shortening, cardiac work, stroke work, and the double product did not change significantly during the study, postmortem examination demonstrated biventricular hypertrophy. Thus, despite markedly elevated catecholamine levels and no elevation of systemic arterial pressure, myocardial hypertrophy developed. These studies lend support to the hypothesis that norepinephrine may be a direct myocardial tropic hormone and suggest that intense activation of reflex buffering mechanisms maintains blood pressure in the normal range during chronic catecholamine infusion.\r"

The study quantitates both regional and organ blood flow and resistance in conscious rats both above and below an experimentally produced coarctation. The experimental group consisted of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats with a mean pressure gradient of 68 mm Hg across the coarctation. This experimental group was compared with a group of eight control rats with no pressure gradient. Flow measurements were made with radioactively labeled microspheres 4 weeks after aortic constriction. This aortic coarctation produced an increase in cardiac index (22%) and total peripheral resistance (19%). Blood flow through tissues proximal to the coarctation was not different from control; vascular resistance was increased (31%). Flow through the tissues distal to the coarctation was increased (16%); vascular resistance was decreased (-22%). The upper carcass, diaphragm, and brain were the tissues most representative of flow above the coarctation, and the lower carcass and large intestine were the tissues most representative of flow below the coarctation. Coarctation of the aorta produced cardiac hypertrophy and increased microsphere shunting to the lungs.\r"

Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed diets containing 0.4 or 8.0% NaCl for 32 days. At the conclusion of the study, blood pressure was significantly higher in the rats fed a high NaCl diet than in controls. Liver, kidney, and heart copper concentrations were significantly lower in the rats fed a high NaCl diet compared with controls, while plasma copper levels were higher. In contrast, tissue zinc levels were higher in the rats fed a high NaCl diet than in controls, while plasma zinc levels were lower. It is hypothesized that alterations in copper and zinc metabolism may be one factor underlying tissue damage in these animals.\r"

Pedigree analysis revealed that children of matings in which both parents were hypertensive had a significantly greater risk of hypertension than children of matings in which one parent or neither parent was hypertensive. Blood types N and MN were abnormally distributed among hypertensive as compared with normotensive members of white but not black families. The distribution of ABO and Rh types was not significantly different between hypertensive and normotensive siblings. When all possible pairings of siblings were examined for HLA haplotype sharing, abnormal distributions were observed among hypertensive sib pairs whereas the expected mendelian segregation was observed among hypertensive-normotensive sib pairs and normotensive-normotensive sib pairs. These results suggest the genetic factors controlling variation in blood pressure may include loci in the region of the MN locus on chromosome 4 and, possibly, the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6.\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances in peripheral norepinephrine release or removal by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake may have pathogenetic significance in cardiovascular disease states. We investigated the mechanisms of removal of norepinephrine in the forearm of healthy subjects under basal conditions, using measurements of arterial and venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations, blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm blood flow. The specific inhibitor of neuronal uptake, desipramine, was infused intra-arterially into the brachial artery of five subjects. Net norepinephrine overflow from the forearm increased markedly, revealing considerable local release of norepinephrine. Six other subjects received four intra-arterial infusions of norepinephrine, 1.18 pmol/kg/min, with various doses of desipramine and the extraneuronal uptake-inhibiting drug hydrocortisone. The forearm extraction rate for circulating norepinephrine decreased with increasing doses of desipramine (from 69.4 +/- 3.0 [SEM] to 35.3 +/- 8.4%; p less than 0.001). Increasing doses of hydrocortisone during continued inhibition of neuronal uptake resulted in decreased forearm extraction of norepinephrine (from 63.3 +/- 4.9 to 40.6 +/- 4.4%; p less than 0.01). In six other subjects who received the highest dose of hydrocortisone without concomitant inhibition of neuronal uptake, forearm extraction of norepinephrine decreased from 57.1 +/- 4.9 to 51.5 +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that neuronal uptake contributes markedly to the removal of circulating and endogenously released norepinephrine in the forearm. For circulating norepinephrine, a corticosteroid-sensitive mechanism of extraneuronal uptake was also demonstrated. These results indicate that neuronal and extraneuronal uptake can be estimated separately in this vascular bed. Similar organ-specific studies in patients may reveal disturbances in mechanisms of norepinephrine removal.\r"

The 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and creatinine was measured, and the relationship between urinary cations and blood pressure was studied. Blood pressure and 24-hour sodium excretion were higher in northern China than in southern China. With some exceptions, a positive correlation was found between urinary sodium and blood pressure and a negative one between 24-hour urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure. Urinary calcium correlated negatively and urinary magnesium did not correlate significantly with blood pressure. The sodium/potassium ratio correlated positively with blood pressure, and the calcium/magnesium ratio, negatively. This study confirms the positive within-population relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure in Oriental populations.\r"

This hitherto unrecognised complication might be prevented by ensuring that subclavian hemodialysis catheters are never allowed to reach as far as the right atrium.\r"

The ascitic fluid was reinfused into the peritoneal cavity after ultrafiltration. An average of 6.2 liters of fluid was removed during 4.4 hours of ultrafiltration with no significant change in blood pressure, central venous pressure, hemoglobin, platelets or plasma creatinine. Ascitic fluid albumin rose significantly immediately after the procedure (from 5.2 +/- 4.3 gm/L to 31.9 +/- 30.0 gm/L, P less than 0.01). The plasma albumin concentration increased significantly at the end of UF (P less than 0.001). Also there was a significant increase in urine output (P less than 0.001), urinary sodium excretion (P less than 0.001), and endogenous creatinine clearance (P less than 0.01) during the 48 hours following UF. There was no evidence of hemodynamic, renal or hematological dysfunction, and other complications, including encephalopathy, peritonitis and variceal bleeding were not experienced. Ultrafiltration of ascitic fluid with hemofilter may be safely used in the temporary relief of refractory ascites due to cirrhosis or intra-abdominal malignancy.\r"

The standard device consists of a cylindrical container which is tapered towards the outlet end. Flow enters the column through a small inlet tube into the wide frontal area of the column. Having passed through the column containing collodian coated activated charcoal spheres, it leaves by the tapered outlet. In order to achieve our aim, we designed and built a two-dimensional plexiglass model consisting of a vertical cross section of the actual hemoperfusion device. Glass beads were used to simulate the artificial carbon cells and a colored solution was used to enable us to visualize the flow. In the normal configuration, it was determined that stagnation and channelling were present. The model was then analysed in the inverse configuration. This way, flow inlet is through the tapered end and flow outlet is towards the wider cylindrical end. This inverse flow configuration improved the flow characteristics and eliminated most of the channelling and stagnation.\r"

A modified dead-end technique has been employed, with high flow rate recirculating plasma on the plasma fractionation filter (QD recycled CF), and an albumin-rich, globulin-poor filtrate was reinfused into the patient. Postprocedure recoveries were 81 +/- 15% for albumin, 55 +/- 23% for IgM and 48% for cryocrit, with an increase in A/G ratio from 1.8 to 2.1. An improvement was observed also in antiatherogenic/atherogenic lipoproteins ratio, suggesting a possible use of this technique in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia. Plasma primary separation was obtained by centrifugation or by filtration, and no significant differences were observed on subsequent protein fractionation process. An albumin priming of the plasmafractionation circuit accounted for an additional 13% saving in postprocedure level. Different surface area secondary filters have been employed: with larger surfaces, larger volumes were processed without any increase in the waste volume and with reduced need for washouts, but with an additional loss of small molecules possibly due to entrapping onto the membrane.\r"

Seven of the 53 CAPD patients (13%) had an elevated total CK, and only one of these 7 patients had an elevated CK-MB greater than 5%. In contrast 22 HD patients (42%) had increased total CK values, and 6 of these 22 HD patients (27%) showed elevated CK-MB isoenzyme greater than 5%. For each sex, blacks had higher mean CK values than whites. Twenty-one out of the 43 HD patients who received intramuscular injections had elevated total CK values and 6 of these 21 patients had elevated CK-MB isoenzyme independent of the timing of injection. The increased frequency of higher total CK values in HD patients appears to be related to race and androgen administration. The modest elevations in CK-MB fraction (5 to 8%) in these patients require careful interpretation.\r"

The release of lysozyme, beta-glucuronidase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and the generation of a platelet aggregating activity were studied in the supernatants from plasma-free human PMN incubated with different membranes. The PMN intracellular content of neutrophil cationic proteins (NCP), elastase, and cathepsin G were also studied by immunofluorescence using specific antisera on smears of PMN before and after incubation with each membrane. Only cationic, but not anionic or neutral PMMA induced a marked release of lysozyme (range 20-25% of the sonicated control, assumed as 100%), and beta-glucuronidase (40-43%), and marked depletion of the intracellular content of NCP, elastase, and cathepsin G, suggesting a degranulation process. Platelet aggregating activity was generated and referred to the release of platelet activating factor (PAF) only in the supernatants from PMN incubated with cationic, but not with anionic, or neutral PMMA membranes. These results indicate that modification of the net electric charge can per se turn PMMA, commonly recognized as inert, into a material with marked PMN activating effects, comparable to those of Cu, a highly reactive polymer.\r"

The histology in 79 out of 147 remaining patients showed acute tubular necrosis in 64, acute cortical necrosis in 13, and acute interstitial nephritis in 2. Overall mortality was 27.4%. This high incidence of ARF due to infective diarrhoeas and dysentery reflects poor socio-economic and hygienic conditions, inadequate facilities in rural areas, delays in seeking medical advice, and lack of knowledge about fluid and electrolyte therapy amongst the staff.\r"

All the specimens showed necrosis of trabeculae and of bone marrow, but the most common and characteristic feature was evidence of old and new haemorrhage in the marrow. In the areas of intramedullary haemorrhages, trabeculae and bone marrow were completely necrotic, with a transitional area of incomplete necrosis between these areas and those without haemorrhagic lesions, where the trabeculae and bone marrow were normal. There was good correlation between necrosis and haemorrhagic episodes, and it was concluded that repeated intramedullary haemorrhage at the silent stage is probably related to the pathogenesis of idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\r"

Fifty-two were revised for pain, 36 by removal of the trochanteric wire and 16 by reattachment of the greater trochanter. Successful relief of pain was obtained in less than half the cases. There was no difference in the incidence of back pain, wiring technique, trochanteric advancement, previous surgery to the same hip, trochanteric size or the pattern of wire breakage in the successfully treated group and the unsuccessful group. Neither was the removal of intact wire from a united trochanter any more certain of relieving pain than removal of broken wire from an un-united trochanter. Six patients later required revision for loosening or infection. These results indicate the need for full radiological and haematological investigation before exploration of the greater trochanter. At exploration for pain the wires should simply be removed as we could show no successful union after late reattachment of the trochanter in the absence of instability.\r"

There was no significant difference between the two series in primary operations, the infection rate being 1.72% and 1.65% respectively. However, in secondary operations (conversions and revisions) the gentamicin-containing cement gave significantly better results--a 0.81% infection rate as compared with 3.46%. All operations were performed in a clean air enclosure using total-body exhaust suits. Radiological diagnosis of deep infection was possible within one year of operation in all cases. Late haematogenous infection occurred in one case and was related to a skin lesion.\r"

In 83 hips the indication for surgery had been pain, and of these patients 73 (88%) had appreciable relief within one year of operation. The other 11 hips were all in children and were painless; in them the osteotomy had successfully stabilised progressive subluxation of the hip. At review after a mean follow-up of 10 years (range, 2 to 18 years) 68 previously painful hips were reassessed. Although function of the hips had deteriorated slowly with time, four of the seven cases with 18 years' follow-up had good function and only minor symptoms. A detailed analysis of the radiographic changes produced by the Chiari osteotomy was made, using computerised analysis of variance. The beneficial effects of the osteotomy resulted from complex changes, among which the provision of a stable fulcrum for the hip seemed to be the most important.\r"

A review of 697 primary and revision replacements carried out between 1969 and 1985 and followed up from 1 to 16 years found that such deformity was present in 61% of knees before the primary operation. Replacement reduced this to 17% and the improvement was usually maintained. The deformity was present in only 21% of the replacements which required revision and the second operation reduced this to 8%. Flexion contractures affected rheumatoid knees more often and more seriously than osteoarthritic knees, but arthroplasty was more successful in correcting the deformity in the former. All of the 11 types of prosthesis used achieved some degree of correction, but the Walldius hinge and the variants of the Freeman condylar design were the most successful. Surprisingly, the best outcome, in terms of pain and reduced need for revision, was found in the rheumatoid knees most seriously deformed before operation, but this association was absent in the osteoarthritic knees. Postoperative deformity in knees without pain or extreme weakness did not appear to influence the patients' ability to walk or to use stairs or a chair, as measured by unexacting tests in the clinic.\r"

We present a method for the objective evaluation of bone adjacent to metallic implants in which a modified technique of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is used to reconstruct cross-sectional images with few artefacts. We have used this technique in 19 patients with knee arthroplasties to monitor the changes in bone density around the tibial stem of the prosthesis. In the first weeks after operation all patients showed a decrease in bone density ranging from 0.4% to 3.6% per month. One year after arthroplasty bone density had stabilised and only minor changes were observed. Our work indicates that modified QCT is a sensitive method for the long-term monitoring of the anchorage of implants and allows the early detection of osteolytic changes.\r"

In six of these eight children there was a hump or projection of the medial growth plate. It is suggested that this hump stabilises the anteromedial part of the epiphysis in a manner similar to the partial anteromedial fusion seen in older children, and that this accounts for the occurrence of triplane fracture in the presence of an open growth plate.\r"

Another series of tests on isolated pieces of disc material showed that chymopapain could reduce the size of prolapsed nuclear material by 24% in one hour and by 80% in 48 hours. It is concluded that, in the short-term, chymopapain has a negligible effect on the mechanics of a disc but it can reduce the size of any prolapsed nuclear material with which it comes in contact.\r"

Although heel pad migration, scar rotation and os calcis remnants were seen, these could be accommodated by the prosthesis. Syme's amputation is tolerated well in the younger child and, in patients with a predicted leg-length discrepancy of over 15 cm associated with an abnormal foot, we recommend the operation as a primary procedure between the ages of 18 months and two years.\r"

In five normal subjects studied, the plasma concentration of NaFl peaked at 5-15 minutes before decaying with first order kinetics and corresponding dermofluorescence (DF) rose to a peak between 10-20 minutes before decaying. Peak DF in the head and neck was significantly higher (P less than .001) compared to other skin sites which were similar. Application to patients (n = 16) undergoing successful lower limb revascularization showed a significant (P less than 0.01) improvement in perfusion at the foot level only. The reproducibility of FDF was poor when studied on the control limbs. We conclude that FDF does not, at present, constitute a valid measure of skin perfusion.\r"

The findings included a right renal artery stenosis, an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a splanchnic vasculature completely supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery. Consequently it was thought that a prolonged clamping time during the aortic repair would possibly result in ischemic injury. Therefore, the splanchnic organs were perfused by a paediatric oxygenator and pump during the aortic cross-clamping. This case report discusses the etiology of the disease and the technical aspects of splanchnic perfusion.\r"

The LD instrument is well suited to the determination of the initiation of flow in the microcirculation after a period of arrest due to externally applied counterpressure. Radioisotope clearance and photoplethysmography have been used to measure skin perfusion pressure (SPP) in an effort to predict healing of ischemic ulcerations and amputation wounds. By placing the LD probe beneath a blood pressure cuff, SPP was measured at the forearm, thigh, calf, foot, dorsal and plantar great toe. The SPP was measured in 32 normal limbs and 26 limbs with rest pain, ulceration or gangrene. Skin of normal extremities and forearm and thigh skin of patients with ischemic lower extremities had a mean SPP of 47 mmHg (+/- 5 SEM). The SPP in ischemic extremities was significantly lower at the calf 22 +/- 4 (p less than .001), the foot 10 +/- 2 (p less than .0001), and the toe 16 +/- 4 (p less than .0001). SPP was greater at the plantar toe (73 +/- 5) than in all other locations. Skin of the plantar toe was unique among the sites measured because it is rich in arteriovenous anastomoses, which have a thermoregulatory function. The higher pressure probably reflects the fact that the larger arterioles have a higher intraluminal pressure than the capillaries and, therefore, a more proximal level of the microcirculation is measured by the LD instrument in thermoregulatory areas of the skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All cases of extremity ischemia in the Pennsylvania Hospital Vascular Surgical Registry, from January 1, 1967 to December 31, 1984, were reviewed. This study involves six patients who developed ischemia secondary to radiation induced arterial injury. Five cases involved the lower extremities (iliac arteries) and one case involved the upper extremity (subclavian artery). The pathologic changes occurring in these irradiated arteries and their relationship to atherosclerosis is discussed. All patients were successfully managed by arterial bypass procedures.\r"

The alternative, retroperitoneal exposure of the aorta, although utilized for the first reported repair of an AAA by Dubost and championed by Rob, Stipa and Shaw, Helsby and Moosa and more recently by Williams et al., offers superior exposure and decreased post-operative morbidity. Despite these advantages, it is not commonly used by most vascular surgeons for the surgical management of aortic aneurysms. We have treated 35 patients using an extended retroperitoneal approach in which the aneurysm was treated by division of the infra-renal aorta, an end-to-end proximal anastomosis with an aortic bypass, and over-sewing of the aneurysm. In this group of patients, we found less post-operative physiological disturbances and a reduced requirement for blood transfusion. These data suggest that this method of retroperitoneal exclusion and bypass is generally applicable and is of particular value in the obese and/or the higher risk, medically disadvantaged patient.\r"

The femoral nerve palsy was left-sided 23 times, right-sided 9 times and bilateral twice. Twenty-nine patients had a complete recovery after 1/2 to 1 years. It is suggested that the femoral neuropathy is of ischaemic nature and caused by aortic clamping. The scant blood supply of the intrapelvic section of the femoral nerve is derived from the iliolumbar artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, and from the deep circumflex iliac artery, a branch of the external iliac artery. On the right side the deep circumflex iliac artery gives more branches to the nerve and there are more anastomoses with the fourth and fifth lumbar arteries, than on the left side. This may be the explanation for the preference of the nerve palsy for the left side.\r"

In four patients with dexamethasone-suppressible hyperaldosteronism, mineralocorticoid-binding sites in mononuclear leukocytes were normal (291 +/- 108 sites/cell). In all patients undergoing surgery for unilateral adenoma, the receptors normalized 3 months after the operation. In two patients the reduction in receptors persisted for a short time after surgery even though the plasma aldo level had already normalized. We conclude that mineralocorticoid excess produces down-regulation of mineralocorticoid receptors, which, in turn, might contribute to the genesis of the aldo escape phenomenon.\r"

Human dermal fibroblasts have receptors that recognize PTH and a factor associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in rats. We examined 10 human dermal fibroblast lines for an adenylate cyclase response to PTH. Six of 10 lines tested displayed a definite response (2.4- to 3.8-fold over basal) to 10(-6) M bovine PTH-(1-34). This response was inhibited by the PTH analog and antagonist Nle8,18,Tyr34-bPTH-(3-34). We also examined whether human dermal fibroblasts are capable of responding to either a human PTH-like tumor-derived factor or the PTH-like factor contained in human keratinocyte-conditioned medium. Both human humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy-associated tumor extract (2.5 X 10(-10) M) and keratinocyte-conditioned medium (8 X 10(-10) M) stimulated human dermal fibroblast adenylate cyclase. These concentrations are markedly lower than those required for PTH-induced adenylate cyclase stimulation. This activity was also inhibited by the PTH analog. The high prevalence of PTH-responsive adenylate cyclase in dermal fibroblast lines and the apparent potency of tumor-derived and keratinocyte-derived PTH-like factors in dermal fibroblasts suggest that these factors may play a role in normal dermal physiology.\r"

  ".W": "The bone histology in patients with chronic renal failure and aluminum-related bone disease does not always show the excess accumulation of unmineralized osteoid (matrix) characteristic of osteomalacia. Frequently, bone aluminum accumulation is associated with normal or reduced amounts of unmineralized osteoid and low bone formation and is referred to as aplastic bone disease. In this study, we compared static and dynamic bone histomorphometric parameters and plasma PTH and aluminum levels in 12 patients with osteomalacia and 18 patients with aplastic bone disease who had been receiving dialysis for the same duration to determine if the difference in osteoid accumulation in these 2 lesions might be explained by differences in aluminum accumulation or PTH levels. The stainable bone surface aluminum level was significantly higher in the patients with osteomalacia compared to that in the group with aplastic bone [61 +/- 5% (+/- SEM) vs. 43 +/- 4%; P less than 0.02]. The rates of bone apposition and bone formation were lower in the group with osteomalacia (P less than 0.01). Plasma amino-terminal PTH was not significantly different in the 2 groups. The increment in plasma aluminum levels after a single infusion of deferoxamine was higher in the osteomalacic group than in the aplastic group, suggesting that the patients with osteomalacia accumulated more total body chelatable aluminum than did those with aplastic bone disease during a comparable length of time on dialysis. We conclude that the excess unmineralized osteoid in aluminum-related osteomalacia results from the high rate of total body aluminum accumulation, which directly causes uncoupling of matrix mineralization and matrix production, independent of PTH levels. Patients with aplastic bone disease who have accumulated lesser amounts of total body aluminum fail to develop excess unmineralized osteoid because production and mineralization of matrix are more closely coupled than in the osteomalacic lesion, despite a decline in osteoblast numbers.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of the relationship of gonadal function to impotence in men with diabetes mellitus have yielded conflicting results. Pituitary-testicular function was studied in 28 impotent diabetic men and 15 normal men. Impotence was documented by clinical history and subdivided into categories of primary organic (n = 16), primary psychogenic (n = 7), and unclassified (n = 5) on the basis of nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing, psychological testing, and penile vascular studies. All NPT parameters were diminished (P less than or equal to 0.001) in the impotent diabetic men compared to values in the normal men. Endocrine studies revealed increased urinary LH (P less than or equal to 0.05) and diminished serum free testosterone levels in the diabetic men with primary organic impotence. These changes were not found in normal men or diabetic men with primary psychogenic impotence. Six months of treatment in a home blood glucose-monitoring program resulted in significant improvement in metabolic control but no improvement in pituitary-testicular function, NPT, or sexual performance in the primary organic impotent group. Eight patients with primary organic impotence and no evidence of penile vascular disease had significant improvement (P less than or equal to 0.01) in NPT results as well as subjective improvement in sexual function after 6 months of parenteral testosterone administration. These studies suggest that primary gonadal dysfunction may be related to organic impotence in diabetes, and improvement in selected patients can occur with androgen therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma ACTH, cortisol, and GH concentrations were measured at 15-min intervals for 24 h in 11 men suffering from major depressive illness during an acute episode of depression and during clinical remission following antidepressant treatment with either electroconvulsive therapy or amitriptyline. Seven age-matched normal men also were studied. During the acute phase of the illness, the patients had abnormally short rapid eye movement sleep latencies, hypercortisolism, early timing of the nadirs of the ACTH-cortisol rhythms, and shorter nocturnal periods of quiescent cortisol secretion. GH was hypersecreted during wakefulness, and a major pulse occurred before, rather than after, sleep onset. After treatment, rapid eye movement sleep latencies were lengthened, and cortisol levels returned to normal due to a decrease in the magnitude of episodic pulses. Moreover, the timing of the circadian rhythms of ACTH and cortisol as well as the duration of the quiescent period of cortisol secretion were normalized. The amount of GH secreted during wakefulness decreased to normal values, with fewer significant GH pulses. The major elevation of GH secretion in the early part of the night occurred later than that during the depressive episode. These results demonstrate that a disorder of circadian rhythmicity characterizes acute episodes of major depressive illness and that this chronobiological abnormality as well as the hypersecretion of ACTH, cortisol, and GH are state rather than trait dependent.\r"

The activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme responsible for HDL cholesterol production, and the activity of hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), the enzyme that facilitates the catabolism of HDL, were measured in plasma obtained after iv injection of heparin. Thirty patients were selected to represent a wide range of serum HDL cholesterol concentrations (low, normal, and high HDL cholesterol groups). Mean lipoprotein lipase activity was similar in all three groups [122 +/- 10 (SEM) U/mL in the low HDL, 141 +/- 11 U/mL in the normal HDL, and 148 +/- 30 U/mL in the high HDL group]. Mean HTGL activity was markedly decreased in the high HDL group; the mean values were 346 +/- 28 U/mL in the low HDL, 320 +/- 25 U/mL in the normal HDL, and 191 +/- 23 U/mL in the high HDL groups, respectively. Body weight and insulin requirement correlated directly with HTGL activity and inversely with serum HDL cholesterol levels. These findings suggest that in type II diabetes mellitus low serum HDL cholesterol levels may be due to an increased rate of clearance by HTGL.\r"

The three control monkeys developed varying degrees of baldness, while the three 4-MA-treated monkeys retained their juvenile pattern of hair growth. The percentage of actively growing hair follicles in the frontal scalp did not change in the 4-MA-treated group [46 +/- 6 (+/- SE) vs. 48 +/- 4], while a significant decrease occurred in the control group (63 +/- 6 vs. 25 +/- 12; P less than 0.025). Skin 5 alpha-reductase activity was reduced in the scalp of the 4-MA-treated monkeys.

The peptides were characterized by molecular sieving and Concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. Immunoreactivity was detected using antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal portions of the hNT (hNT and gamma 3MSH antibodies, respectively). The mean immunoreactive hNT (IR-hNT) levels in samples of CSF from normal subjects, patients with hydrocephalus, methadone addicts, and the patient with Nelson's syndrome were 410 +/- 158 (+/- SE), 435 +/- 137, 328 +/- 183, and 85,700 pg/mL, respectively. Molecular sieving chromatography revealed one predominant species of IR-hNT and/or gamma 3MSH which coeluted with the authentic hNT-(1-76) marker. However, 10-16% of the total immunoreactivity eluted close to the void volume. No significant differences in the elution profiles were found among these groups. Most (61-69%) of the IR-hNT bound to Concanavalin A, and the elution patterns of samples from this column were similar to that of purified hNT-(1-76). These results support the view that the major molecular form of hNT in CSF is NT-(1-76) as it is in the pituitary gland.\r"

  ".U": "87222932\r", 
  ".W": "Aldosterone secretion in man is stimulated by potassium (K), ACTH, and angiotensin II (AII) and inhibited by dopamine (DA). In normal sodium-replete supine individuals, aldosterone secretion is under maximum tonic inhibition by DA and is not inhibited further by DA administration. Sodium depletion alters plasma aldosterone responses to secretogogues. Upright posture, another physiological stimulus to aldosterone secretion, recently was demonstrated to sensitize the adrenal cortex to inhibition of aldosterone secretion by a large quantity of DA (4.0 micrograms/kg X min). The effect of upright posture on aldosterone responses to other secretogogues is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of upright posture on aldosterone responses to low infusion rates of DA, to the DA antagonist metoclopramide (M) and to AII and ACTH. Fourteen normal men eating a normal sodium diet were studied. In eight, PRA, plasma aldosterone (PAC), plasma cortisol (F), and serum K concentrations were determined after 4 h of upright posture and infusion of vehicle (D5W) or DA at 0.1, 0.4, and 2.0 micrograms/kg X min. Six other normal men were kept supine for 3 h and, on separate days, upright for 3 h and given iv M (10-mg bolus dose), AII (1 and 4 pmol/kg X min for 30 min), and ACTH (20 and 120 mU/h for 30 min). PAC, PRA, F, and K were measured before and after these three secretogogues were administered. In the presence of vehicle, mean PAC increased by 15.1 +/- 4.3 (+/- SEM) ng/dL after 4 h of upright posture. In the presence of DA infused at 0.1, 0.4, and 2.0 micrograms/kg X min, the PAC response to upright posture was decreased to 9.7 +/- 2.5 (P = NS), 7.5 +/- 3.9 (P less than 0.05), and 8.1 +/- 2.0 (P less than 0.05) ng/dL, respectively. This occurred without a decrease in PRA, F, or K. The stimulation of PAC 10 and 20 min after a 10-mg bolus dose of M was 9.6 +/- 3.3 and 9.3 +/- 2.6 ng/dL, respectively, in supine subjects and 8.3 +/- 2.3 and 10.8 +/- 3.4 ng/dL 10 and 20 min after the M dose in upright subjects. The responses of PAC to ACTH and AII also were unchanged after 3 h of upright posture. We conclude that upright posture sensitizes the adrenal cortex to inhibition of aldosterone secretion by DA without affecting other modifiers of aldosterone secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Six patients had previously undiagnosed hypogonadism, and 8 had normal gonadal function and no evident etiology for osteoporosis. Bone histomorphometry revealed no differences in structural measurements or resorption indices between the 2 groups. However, compared to reference values for normal postmenopausal women, osteoblast surface, mineralizing surface, and formation rate were normal or modestly increased in the hypogonadal men and significantly reduced in the idiopathic group. There were significant corresponding differences between the 2 groups in the fasting urinary hydroxyproline to creatinine ratio, an index of bone resorption, and serum total alkaline phosphatase, an index of bone formation. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels did not differ between the 2 groups and were above 10 ng/mL in all patients. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] levels were normal in the hypogonadal group and significantly reduced in the idiopathic group, but did not correlate with any histological measurements. The formation indices fell substantially in 3 of 4 hypogonadal men after 7-14 months of therapy with testosterone and a calcium supplement. We conclude the following. In vitamin D-replete hypogonadal men with osteoporosis, 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis is normal, and bone remodeling is modestly increased and correctable by hormone replacement therapy, as in normal postmenopausal women. In middle-aged men with idiopathic osteoporosis, there is impairment of 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis and of the recruitment and activity of teams of osteoblasts, as in postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

The men had a significantly greater GH response than did the age-matched premenopausal women (P less than 0.05). The mean individual peak GH response was significantly higher in the premenopausal compared with the postmenopausal women (P less than 0.05). Premarin decreased the number of hot flushes (P less than 0.01), but had no effect on the GH response to clonidine. These results suggest that estrogens do not enhance alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms that regulate GH secretion and that improvement in menopausal flushing after estrogen therapy is not mediated by an effect on central alpha 2-adrenergic function.\r"

SRIH receptor distribution was compared with that of immunoreactive GH and PRL in the same tissue sections. Among the 10 tumors from acromegalic patients, 7 contained a high or medium density of SRIH receptors, whereas only a low density of such receptors was present in the remaining 3 tumors despite a comparably high concentration of immunoreactive GH in all 10 tumors. No correlation between plasma GH levels and SRIH receptors was found. One corticotroph tumor was SRIH receptor negative. Among the 5 prolactinomas tested, only 1 contained a significant density of SRIH receptors, the distribution of which did not correlate with that of immunoreactive PRL cells. Interestingly, among the 15 endocrine-inactive adenomas investigated, 6 had a measurable, sometimes high, density of SRIH receptors despite undetectable GH, PRL, or TSH immunoreactivity. These results suggest that based on their SRIH receptor content, there may be subclasses of GH-producing pituitary adenomas. The difference in SRIH receptor density may be an explanation for the clinically described differential responsiveness of acromegalic patients to SRIH. The results also suggest that subclasses of endocrine-inactive pituitary adenomas may exist; some of them contain significant amounts of SRIH receptors, which may be responsive to SRIH treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory action of thyroid hormones (TH) and glucocorticoids on circadian and pulsatile TSH secretion was investigated in groups of five normal men by sampling blood every 10 min for 24 h (start, 1750 h). Serum TSH was measured by a sensitive immunoradiometric assay. Continuous infusion of 50 micrograms T3 or 250 micrograms T4 for 8 h (1900-0300 h) significantly suppressed serum TSH levels (T3, P less than 0.025; T4, P less than 0.05; by paired t test). Administration of 3 g sodium ipodate 7 h before TH infusion did not alter the TSH response to T3, but T4-dependent suppression was abolished. Pulsatile TSH secretion [basally, 5.8 +/- 1.3 (+/- SD) pulses/24 h, as analyzed by the PULSAR program; 6.8 +/- 1.9 by the Cluster program] was not significantly altered by any of the experimental conditions. The additional finding of blunting of the TSH response to TRH after TH alone or ipodate and T3 suggests a predominantly pituitary feedback action of TH exerted via conversion of T4 to T3. In contrast, bolus injections of 4 mg dexamethasone (dex) at 1900 and 2200 h abolished TSH pulses for at least 6 h (PULSAR, 6.6 +/- 1.6 pulses/24 h basally vs. 3.6 +/- 3.0 under dex; Cluster, 7.0 +/- 2.7 pulses/24 h basally vs. 1.6 +/- 1.6 under dex). Dex administration also resulted in a prompt, sustained, and significant suppression of basal TSH (P less than 0.0005). Together with a normal serum TSH response to TRH (in separate experiments 1, 9, and 19 h after dex administration), these data suggest that glucocorticoid feedback occurs at a suprapituitary level.\r"

To test this hypothesis, alveolar liquid pressure (Pliquid) was measured by micropuncture in isolated lungs of mature and immature fetal rabbits (with and without surfactant replacement) at different air inflation pressures (Pairway). Lung maturity was assessed by air pressure-volume (P-V) curves. Pliquid was correlated with surfactant content in the lungs and with alveolar size. Pliquid was lower in immature (2.3 +/- 0.7 cmH2O) than in mature (8.4 +/- 1.0 cmH2O) lungs at comparable Pairway (25 cmH2O) (P less than 0.01). The mean linear intercept, a measure of airspace dimensions was similar in all lungs (42.1 +/- 2.0 micron), but alveolar wash phospholipid/g wet lung was lower in immature than in mature lungs (0.05 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.30 mg) (P less than 0.01). Surfactant replacement in immature lungs resulted in P-V curves and Pliquid similar to those of mature lungs. If pericapillary interstitial liquid pressure approximates Pliquid, surfactant deficiency will predispose preterm infants to pulmonary edema.\r"

We now show by immunoblotting that GP 210 binds heat-aggregated rabbit and human IgG, as well as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-anti-KLH and ovalbumin (OA)-anti-OA immune complexes. Immune complex binding to GP 210 was preserved on chymotrypsin-treated platelets that lacked glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib). In contrast, ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination resulted in disappearance of immunologically detectable GP 210 and loss of immune complex binding, even though GP Ib remained intact. Purified Fc fragments inhibited binding of anti-GP 210 antibody to intact platelets and to GP 210 on immunoblots. The Fc fragments also blocked immune complex binding to GP 210. Conversely, anti-GP 210 antiserum and F(ab)2 fragments inhibited binding of fluorescein-labeled Fc fragments to intact platelets. We conclude that GP 210 functions as a platelet Fc receptor.\r"

Basal HCO3- secretion was not significantly altered after vagotomy, while basal H+ secretion, parietal volume and nonparietal volume secretion were reduced significantly. Intravenous gastrin-17 infusion reduced gastric HCO3- secretion by approximately 50% in both unoperated ulcer patients and normal subjects (P less than 0.05). Gastrin-17 infusion did not inhibit gastric HCO3- secretion after vagotomy. In fact, mean gastric HCO3- secretion increased to a nearly significant extent in response to gastrin (P = 0.06). These findings indicate that gastrin inhibits gastric HCO3- secretion in humans and that the gastrin-induced reduction in gastric HCO3- secretion is dependent upon intact vagal innervation to the oxyntic mucosa.\r"

In the present study we have measured the albumin synthesis in four patients with inflammatory diseases using the [14C]carbonate technique. Because inflammation causes a decreased albumin synthesis and this decreased synthesis could not be related to a reduced amino acid supply, we have also examined the possible molecular mechanisms of reduced albumin synthesis during inflammation using in vivo and in vitro experiments in rats. In rats with turpentine-induced inflammation, serum albumin concentration and liver albumin mRNa level were markedly decreased. These changes could not be reproduced by administration of fibrinogen-, or fibrin-degradation products, or several hormones, such as corticosteroids, growth hormone, and adrenaline. However, monocytic products, especially interleukin 1, postulated to be important mediators of the inflammatory response, reduced albumin synthesis and liver albumin messenger RNA content but not total protein synthesis in rats in vivo and in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. These findings suggest that monocytic products play an important role in reduced albumin synthesis during inflammation.\r"

PBDHT was similar when measured at both sites in men (674 +/- 79 vs. 788 +/- 207 SE micrograms/d); however, PUDHT was greater than PBDHT in women (174 +/- 55 vs. 55 +/- 8 micrograms/d, P less than 0.02). Excretion rates of DHT and 3 alpha-androstanediol (3 alpha diol) were similar in both sexes despite major differences in blood levels. However, between sexes large differences were present in 3 alpha diol glucuronide (3 alpha diolG) in both plasma and urine. These observations indicate that peripheral (renal) formation of DHT and probably 3 alpha diol were not accurately determined by measurement of these steroids in blood. The large difference between blood and urine production rates in women suggests an important role of non-testosterone precursors of 5 alpha-reduced steroids. Measurements of 3 alpha diolG may provide more insight into these peripheral events.\r"

Determination of the relative importance of these photoproducts to the elimination of bilirubin requires knowledge of their rates of excretion. We have measured the rate at which the structural isomer of bilirubin, lumirubin, disappeared from the serum of nine jaundiced premature infants after the cessation of phototherapy. In all patients studied, the decline in serum lumirubin could be approximated by a first-order rate equation with a half-life of 80 to 158 min. This rate of disappearance is much faster than that previously determined for the other major bilirubin photoproducts. In samples of bile aspirated from the duodenum of infants undergoing phototherapy, lumirubin was the principal bilirubin photoproduct found. These results indicate that formation and excretion of lumirubin is an important route for bilirubin elimination during phototherapy.\r"

To establish the relevance of this observation, we evaluated the role of the prohormone vitamin D3 in regulating cardiovascular function. In rats maintained on a vitamin D3-deficient diet for nine weeks, increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) and serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were observed. These increases coincided with a reduction of serum calcium from 10.3 to 5.6 mg/dl. However, while serum calcium remained depressed throughout the study, increases in BP and serum CPK were transient. After nine weeks of vitamin D3-depletion, but not after six weeks, ventricular and vascular muscle contractile function were also markedly enhanced. The increase in ventricular contractile function could not be prevented by maintaining serum calcium at 9.0 mg/dl during the period of D3-depletion. These observations suggest a primary role for the vitamin D3-endocrine system in regulating cardiovascular function.\r"

Dietary fat and cholesterol intakes, plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, cholesterol absorption and sterol synthesis in isolated blood mononuclear leukocytes were measured during each diet period. In 69% of the studies the subjects compensated for the increased cholesterol intake by decreasing cholesterol fractional absorption and/or endogenous cholesterol synthesis. When an increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed there was a failure to suppress endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Plasma cholesterol levels were more sensitive to dietary fat quality than to cholesterol quantity. The results demonstrate that the responses to dietary cholesterol and fat are highly individualized and that most individuals have effective feedback control mechanisms.\r"

Metabolism of rT3 and 3,3'-T2 by isolated rat hepatocytes was analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and radioimmunoassay, with closely agreeing results. Deiodinase activity was inhibited with propylthiouracil (PTU) and sulfotransferase activity by sulfate depletion or addition of salicylamide or dichloronitrophenol. Normally, little 3,3'-T2 production from rT3 was observed, and 125I- was the main product of both 3,[3'-125I]T2 and [3',5'-125I]rT3. PTU inhibited rT3 metabolism but did not affect 3,3'-T2 clearance as explained by accumulation of 3,3'-T2 sulfate. Inhibition of sulfation did not affect rT3 clearance but 3,3'-T2 metabolism was greatly diminished. The decrease in I- formation from rT3 was compensated by an increased recovery of 3,3'-T2 up to 70% of rT3 metabolized. In conclusion, significant production of 3,3'-T2 from rT3 by rat hepatocytes is only observed if further sulfation is inhibited.\r"

Purified polyclonal 125I-IgE was administered intravenously and serial plasma and urine samples were obtained. After analysis, the metabolic data support previously published evidence that IgE (at concentrations found in normal individuals) is catabolized at a higher fractional rate than other immunoglobulins and is catabolized by both an intravascular and an extravascular pathway. In addition, the data show that the fractional catabolic rate for IgE is significantly less for the atopic patients (mean +/- SEM = 0.20 +/- 0.01) and for the HIE patients (0.15 +/- 0.02) than for the normal volunteers (0.52 +/- 0.06; P less than 0.01) and is inversely related (r = -0.851; P less than 0.001) to the serum IgE concentration. These findings have specific importance in showing that decreased fractional catabolic rate contributes substantially to elevation of IgE in atopic and HIE patients. In addition, the findings have general significance in that they lead to a unifying hypothesis of immunoglobulin catabolism.\r"

Addition of polyclonal rabbit anti-T3 serum to T3-containing media decreased cellular T3 content by 50-70%. In unconditioned medium, anti-T3 serum decreased T3-induced cell growth and GH production by 40-70%. In conditioned medium, anti-T3 serum also effected a 45-70% decrease in induction of GH secretion but did not attenuate the growth-promoting activity. Growth-promoting activity was not detected in medium conditioned by T3-depleted cells. Thus, conditioned medium from T3-containing GC cell cultures contains growth-promoting activity that is independent of T3.

Amino acid compositions and surface properties of nephrocalcins isolated from kidney stones closely resembled those of nephrocalcins isolated from urine of stone-forming patients: they differed from normal in lacking gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, and in forming air-water interfacial films that were less stable than those formed by nephrocalcin from normal urine.\r"

The target molecule for the autoantibodies is in close apposition to fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix molecule that is abundant in the upper dermis of skin. In this report, we show specific affinity between fibronectin and the 290,000-D chain of the epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen, and that this affinity is mediated by the gelatin/collagen-binding domain of fibronectin (Mr = 60,000). Since blistering in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita often occurs in the absence of clinical and histological inflammation, a direct interruption in the fibronectin-epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen bond may be involved in the pathogenesis of epidermal-dermal disadherence that occurs in this bullous disease.\r"

In a reexamination of this kindred, we found an abnormal apolipoprotein (apo) B species, apo B-37 (203,000 mol wt), in the plasma lipoproteins of multiple members of the kindred. In affected individuals apo B-37 was found in very low density lipoproteins, along with the normal apo B species, apo B-100 and apo B-48. High density lipoproteins (HDL) also contained apo B-37, but no other apo B species. The first 13 amino-terminal amino acids of apo B-37 were identical to those of normal apo B-100. We utilized a panel of 18 different apo B-specific monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera specific for apo B-37 and the thrombin cleavage products of apo B-100 to map apo B-37 in relation to apo B-100, apo B-48, and the thrombin cleavage products of apo B-100. The results of those immunochemical studies indicated that apo B-37 contains only amino-terminal domains of apo B-100. In affected individuals, the majority of apo B-37 in plasma was contained in the HDL density fraction. Within that fraction apo B-37 was found on discrete lipoprotein particles, termed Lp-B37, that had properties distinct from normal HDL particles containing apo A-I. This report documents for the first time the existence of an abnormal apo B species in humans. Further study of apo B-37 and lipoprotein particles containing apo B-37 should lead to an improved understanding of apo B structure and function.\r"

  ".W": "Using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the relationship between myocardial high-energy phosphate content and flux values for the creatine kinase reaction in the living rat under inotropic states achieved during norepinephrine infusion and halothane anesthesia. Under 2% halothane anesthesia (n = 4), 1% halothane anesthesia (n = 5) and norepinephrine infusion (n = 4), rats developed rate-pressure products of 19.5 +/- 1.6, 32.0 +/- 3.5, and 48.5 +/- 2.0 X 1,000 mmHg/min, respectively. Adenosine triphosphate content was not affected by inotropic state, ranging from 24.3 +/- 1.1 to 25.6 +/- 1.1 mumol/g dry weight, but creatine phosphate content varied inversely and reversibly with cardiac performance from 45.6 +/- 6.0 under 2% halothane to 26.0 +/- 6.5 mumol/g dry weight during norepinephrine infusion. The flux values for the creatine kinase reaction were 15.4 +/- 4.6, 20.5 +/- 2.0, and 30.1 +/- 7.9 mumol/g dry weight per s under 2% halothane, 1% halothane, and 1% halothane with norepinephrine, respectively. These results suggest that the turnover of myocardial high-energy phosphate compounds, not their tissue contents, matches cardiac performance during inotropic stimulation.\r"

Tumor formation was directly related to high expression and shedding of membrane gangliosides. In vivo, as little as 1 pmol of purified total gangliosides of highly tumorigenic cells, injected intradermally with poorly tumorigenic cells (which lacked and did not shed gangliosides), markedly increased the tumorigenicity of these cells in syngeneic normal mice. Thus, gangliosides shed by tumor cells are a previously unrecognized, extremely potent enhancer of tumor formation in vivo.\r"

A coagglutination test for pneumococcal antigen was used as an index of the number of specimens containing pneumococci. A total of 334 specimens were examined. There was evidence of pneumococcal colonisation by culture or coagglutination, or both, in 48 (14.37%), of which 41 (12.27%) yielded S pneumoniae on culture. Anaerobic incubation was better than incubation in carbon dioxide in air for the primary culture of S pneumoniae from sputum. Primary isolation of S pneumoniae was achieved in 11 of the 41 strains (26.82%) by anaerobic incubation alone, by incubation only in carbon dioxide in air in one strain (2.43%), and by both anaerobic incubation and incubation in carbon dioxide in air in 29 strains (70.73%). Anaerobic incubation gave large moist or mucoid colonies that were easy to recognise, but it suppressed the typical draughtsman colony of S pneumoniae. The factor V supplement routinely used in our medium also inhibited the formation of draughtsman colonies. It is suggested that draughtsman colonies occur because of a relative lack of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (factor V), which is required as a reducing agent in aspartate and glutamate metabolism. This nutritional deficiency may lead to bacterial cell wall defect and hence to the autolysis which gives the typical draughtsman colony.\r"

The anaerobic cocci (19 peptococci and seven peptostreptococci) were also negative for heparinase production as were 46 Clostridium spp tested.

All patients with liver metastases had bone metastases. Bone alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic bone disease. Isoenzyme determination provided additional information that would have changed patient management in five of 20 patients who were monitored serially. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme activity, though less sensitive than imaging procedures, can assist in screening for, and in early detection of, a high proportion of bone and liver metastases, and can provide useful objective evidence of their response to treatment.\r"

Specific labelling of a chelatable \"cold\" iron pool in hepatocytes by 59Fe derived from ferritin showed this pool to be equally accessible to parenteral doses of both chelators and also to oral 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one, which is an effective oral iron chelating agent that removes iron from parenchymal cells. This and other alpha-ketohydroxypyridines need further development as potential therapeutic agents in human iron overload.\r"

Transmission electron microscopy showed that the cytoplasmic granularity was due to lysosomal bodies of various sizes. X-ray energy and wavelength spectroscopic analysis showed a high iodine content in these lysosomal bodies, good presumptive evidence of the presence of amiodarone or one of its metabolites. In the second case there was a micronodular cirrhosis, and similar granular cells also containing iodine were seen in the fibrous connective tissue. These cases seem to represent the very early and late stages of amiodarone hepatotoxicity. In a patient taking this drug aggregates of swollen granular cells may be a sensitive and histopathologically useful marker of early amiodarone toxicity.\r"

From the same population as these apparently false negative cases, the number of true positive cases was available, and hence the sensitivity of cervical screening for severe dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma could be assessed. This was found to be 83% after two years. The laboratory procedures which led to the high sensitivity for the cervical cytodiagnosis were analysed. Experienced sample takers and cytotechnologists are very important and can reduce sample and screening errors. A good administrative system is necessary to guarantee proper follow up for women with abnormal findings in their cervical smears.\r"

Twenty one patients with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) had a raised red cell associated IgG, mean (SD) = 5.783 (6.183) ng/10(6) red blood cell compared with that of 69 subjects with a red cell associated IgG of 0.433 (0.349) ng/10(6) red blood cell. Thirteen of 14 blood donors with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) had a normal red cell associated IgG. The only blood donor with positive DAGT and raised red cell associated IgG had AIHA. Studies of red cell associated IgG in other groups of patients were also undertaken. The technique is simple, does not require the use of sophisticated equipment, and is suitable as a routine test in hospital laboratories. The results of red cell associated IgG by PHI are reproducible and clinically relevant.\r"

Onset of painful crisis was associated with raised packed cell volume (PCV) or percentage of haemoglobin S (HbS%), or both. Measurement of whole blood viscosity using in vitro mixtures of blood group compatible normal (AA) and sickle (SS) cells showed that above an HbS of 25% any increase in PCV caused a disproportionate increase in whole blood viscosity. These clinical observations and laboratory data suggest that when regular exchange transfusions are terminated both HbS% and PCV should be carefully monitored. Prophylactic venesection should be considered for patients who maintain their PCV after transfusion as HbS% rises.\r"

Once prolonged heavy drinking had stopped, platelet count and thromboxane formation, calculated either per 10(7) platelets or per litre of blood, significantly increased (p less than 0.05), while the skin bleeding time and urinary excretion of the metabolite of prostacyclin decreased (p less than 0.05). The balance between prostacyclin and thromboxane therefore seemed to favour the excretion of prostacyclin while it shifted to favour thromboxane formation about a week later.\r"

The prevalence of thyroid microsomal antibodies (TMA) was 20%, also higher than the expected 7.6% (p less than 0.01). The age distributions of the females in both groups differed: in the group with hereditary angioedema there was a greater proportion of younger patients which should have resulted in a lower prevalence of thyroid antibodies. Adjusting for related patients with hereditary angioedema, there was still an increased prevalence of TGA (p less than 0.01) and TMA (p less than 0.01).\r"

Real and artificial biles labelled with 14C-cholesterol and 3H-dextran (the latter to correct for adherent mucosal bile) were used; all gall bladders absorbed cholesterol (average 3.5 nmol/cm2/minute). Recovery of the absorbed cholesterol from the tissue showed that about 4% was esterified over 60 minutes. In artificial bile the rate of absorption of cholesterol increased as the bile saturation index rose, but became constant once supersaturation was achieved. In contrast, supersaturated real bile permitted greater absorption of cholesterol, possibly due to enhanced cholesterol solubilisation. Preincubation of gall bladder tissue in sodium cyanide (5 mM) caused a 30% reduction in cholesterol uptake indicating that, although absorption is predominantly a \"passive\" process, there is a partial \"active\" component. There were no pronounced differences in the rate of cholesterol absorption as gall bladders became more diseased, but there was a reduction in the amount of cholesterol ester formed.\r"

There is a strong tendency for persistence or recurrence. Our cases of granulomatous mastitis all occurred in parous women, five of them within three years of pregnancy.

One of these patients was also suffering from pernicious anaemia. A third patient had a large metastasising carcinoid arising in the gastric body and a parathyroid adenoma. Immunohistochemical stains for PGP 9.5 were positive in the carcinoids of all three cases. In all cases the carcinoids showed immunoreactivity for gastrin. A positive family history of endocrine hyperplasia and neoplasia was established in one case. It is suggested that patients with gastrointestinal carcinoids and their families should be evaluated for hyperparathyroidism, and patients with hyperparathyroidism presenting with upper gastrointestinal symptoms should undergo endoscopy to rule out gastric carcinoid tumours.\r"

The adoption of central venous catheters for prolonged parenteral feeding of very preterm infants may have accounted for this phenomenon. Over the same decade there was an increased incidence of Candida isolates from all admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit: the prolonged survival of very low birthweight infants and the use of multiple courses of antibiotics were also factors.\r"

Later lesions showed more intense necrosis and scale crust obscuring the central target but were still dominated by a peripheral lymphocytic infiltrate.

  ".W": "Two kindreds manifesting an unusual form of pachyonychia congenita are described. Clinical involvement consists of nail dystrophy, which tends to improve with age, and moderate palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. In addition, all affected members show a characteristic pattern of cutaneous hyperpigmentation, which resembles macular amyloidosis around the neck and waist, but which confers a dappled appearance to the axillae, popliteal fossae, thighs, buttocks, and lower aspect of the abdomen. With advancing age the pigmentation fades. Histologic and ultrastructural examination of the hyperpigmented skin has revealed pigmentary incontinence and deposition of amyloid within the papillary dermis. These features appear to constitute a distinct variant of pachyonychia congenita.\r"

Fifty-six were black, 25 white, and 3 classified as \"other.\" Children were compared with control groups of children with other skin diseases and with adults with vitiligo. Children had an increased incidence of segmental vitiligo (p less than 0.01). Children had an increased incidence of autoimmune and/or endocrine disease and also of premature graying in their immediate and extended family members (p less than 0.001). Six of 33 children with vitiligo tested had positive organ-specific serum autoantibodies, which was a higher incidence than in the control group of children (p less than 0.05). Eighteen percent of children treated with topical psoralens and long-wave ultraviolet light (PUVA) therapy had an acceptable response, which was less than an adult group similarly treated. We have found childhood vitiligo to be a distinct subset of vitiligo, showing increased segmental presentation; strong autoimmune and/or endocrine disease background and high incidence of premature graying in the families of affected children; the presence of organ-specific serum autoantibodies and a poor response to topical PUVA therapy.\r"

Antibodies against bovine collagen implants have been detected in the sera of virtually all patients with adverse treatment reactions and in small percentages of untreated individuals and treated individuals without adverse reactions. In this study we examined the levels of anti-bovine collagen implant antibodies in 150 individuals prior to bovine collagen implant therapy and then monitored these patients for adverse reactions to skin tests and bovine collagen implant treatments. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the value of pretreatment serology in predicting positive skin tests or adverse reactions. It was determined that individuals with greatly elevated levels (greater than 2 standard deviations [SDs] above the mean reactivity of pretreatment sera) of anti-bovine collagen implant antibodies prior to treatment were approximately sixfold more likely to suffer adverse reactions than patients with no elevation of antibodies prior to treatment.\r"

Radiographic skeletal surveys were performed at various stages during treatment or following treatment. Bone abnormalities were found in eight children. Six children had periosteal thickening, two periosteal bone resorption, two osteoporosis, three disc narrowing, and one slender long bones. Compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls, the children had decreased cortical bone thickness of the second left metacarpal bone. The children's physical growth and laboratory investigations were normal. We recommend that children on long-term etretinate therapy be investigated regularly for bone changes.\r"

At 3 months, clinical appearance was unchanged, as was his strong contact allergy; however, tolerance to natural sunlight was markedly improved. At 6 months the clinical appearance and ultraviolet responses were normal; however, strong contact allergy persisted. To our knowledge, this is the first report of actinic reticuloid in a black person. Azathioprine, after giving an excellent clinical response without leukopenia, was discontinued. A further 9-month follow-up showed continued remission. The persistence of contact allergy, despite profound improvement in photosensitivity and the skin's appearance, suggests that the role of contact allergy in the cause of actinic reticuloid is unclear, and the existence and identity of the hypothesized photosensitizer(s) in actinic reticuloid remain unproved.\r"

This exposed the foci of osteoma cutis. Then the appropriate sized Loo punch (usually the 2.0- or the 2.5-mm punch) was used to excise the bluish-gray miliary lesions. The majority of the foci were removed in one operation. Following excision, the lesions were closed with 7-0 prolene suture. To prevent crust formation postoperatively, Aloe-vera-soaked polyethylene oxide gel dressings (Vigilon) were changed twice daily following an ice water compress. Sutures were removed rapidly in 5 to 7 days to prevent the appearance of suture lines. Although one patient required an additional procedure, the cosmetic results were excellent.

  ".W": "This study examined right ventricular function during exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to answer the following questions: Is there a significant correlation between oxygen consumption at maximal exercise and exercise right ventricular ejection fraction? Does the right ventricular ejection fraction response to exercise correlate with exercise changes in pulmonary artery pressure, total pulmonary resistance or pulmonary vascular resistance? Which combinations of cardiac, ventilatory and blood gas variables are the best predictors of oxygen consumption at maximal exercise? Twenty-six patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease performed symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise with simultaneous hemodynamic and radionuclide ventriculographic measurements. The oxygen consumption at maximal exercise correlated with the exercise right ventricular ejection fraction (n = 21, r = 0.66; p less than 0.005), exercise stroke volume (r = 0.68; p less than 0.001), exercise cardiac output (r = 0.77; p less than 0.00005) and exercise ventilation (r = 0.85; p less than 0.00001). The change in right ventricular ejection fraction from rest to exercise correlated inversely with the change from rest to exercise in total pulmonary resistance (r = -0.51; p less than 0.05) but not with the change in mean pulmonary pressure (r = -0.37) or in pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.09). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables giving the highest combined correlation with oxygen consumption were ventilation and right ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.95, adjusted r2 = 0.88). These results suggest that exercise oxygen consumption of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is related to right ventricular systolic function, exercise right ventricular dysfunction is related, in part, to abnormal exercise total pulmonary resistance, and exercise limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurs as a result of the dynamic interaction between disordered right heart function and ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Animal studies have established that there is a rapid increase in extracellular potassium concentration in myocardial tissue after the onset of ischemia. To study this phenomenon in humans, coronary sinus plasma potassium concentration was measured in five patients undergoing therapeutic coronary angioplasty. Recordings were obtained during a total of 22 coronary artery occlusions lasting between 5 and 50 seconds. Though little change was observed during angioplasty balloon inflation, all occlusions that lasted more than 15 seconds were followed by a transient elevation in coronary sinus potassium concentration of between 0.18 and 1.55 mmol X liter-1. The majority of occlusions (n = 17) were not accompanied by chest pain, electrocardiographic (ECG) changes or alteration of heart rate. The increase in coronary sinus potassium concentration after angioplasty balloon deflation is attributable to a washout of accumulated extracellular potassium during reperfusion. Redistribution of human myocardial potassium occurs within 15 seconds of the onset of myocardial ischemia and may be an important factor accounting for early electrophysiologic changes.\r"

  ".W": "In 54 patients undergoing elective or emergency aortocoronary bypass grafting, angiographic and electrocardiographic changes were studied. Five patients with unstable angina and five patients with evolving myocardial infarction were included. High energy phosphate metabolism and the histologic appearance of the myocardium were analyzed in transmural biopsy specimens acquired at the time of surgery. In patients without anterior infarction on the electrocardiogram, severe stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in a reduction of anterior wall motion that was associated with a partial depletion of the adenylate pool. Mitochondrial function, however, remained intact: the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio, the energy charge and the creatine phosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio were in the normal range. Histologic assessment demonstrated viable myocardium with a high incidence of atrophic cells. In evolving myocardial infarction, 170 minutes of acute coronary artery obstruction resulted in anterior wall akinesia associated with a decrease of the sum of the adenylates to 52% and of creatine phosphate to 16% of their normal value (p less than 0.05). The nucleosides accumulated; their major fraction (91%) was inosine. The adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio increased from 0.14 +/- 0.04 to 0.49 +/- 0.20 (p less than 0.01) and the energy charge decreased from 0.924 +/- 0.021 to 0.660 +/- 0.169 (p less than 0.01). Ultrastructure examination revealed irreversible cell damage in at least the subendocardial layer. These results suggest that the energetic base of reduced contractility due to severe coronary artery stenosis is different from that in acute coronary obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Addition of 1 ml samples of platelet-rich plasma from the coronary sinus of patients with coronary artery disease into a 20 ml organ bath induced an initial relaxation followed by sustained constriction in bioassay coronary artery rings with endothelium and only vasoconstriction in rings without endothelium. The vasoconstrictor activity of the coronary sinus plasma showed positive correlation with the severity and extent of coronary artery narrowing. Systemic arterial and venous plasma samples from patients with coronary artery disease and the coronary sinus plasma from patients with no coronary artery disease evoked only endothelium-dependent relaxations. These vasoactive properties of the various plasma samples were similar whether the samples were taken during rest or during supine bicycle exercise. The serotoninergic receptor antagonist methiothepin prevented the vasoconstriction induced by the coronary sinus plasma samples. These data demonstrate that the coronary sinus blood of patients with atheromatous coronary artery disease exhibits vasoconstrictor activity that may be associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), presumably released from platelets.\r"

Previous studies of diastolic function, however, have not excluded coronary artery disease or addressed the contribution of atrial contraction to diastole. The present study evaluated radionuclide-derived diastolic variables in 13 healthy elderly volunteers aged 75 +/- 6 years without symptoms or risk factors for coronary disease who had normal findings on the stress electrocardiogram, stress gated blood pool imaging and two-dimensional echocardiogram. Results were compared with those of a group of 10 healthy young volunteers aged 26 +/- 5 years. High count, 32 frame, double-buffered gated blood pool acquisitions were obtained at rest in the left anterior oblique view with an RR interval variation less than 5%. Left ventricular time-activity curves were analyzed and flow-volume loops for each group were constructed. In the healthy elderly: peak early diastolic filling rate is decreased, time of peak early filling and time to first third of diastolic filling are delayed, and peak late left ventricular filling rate and percent of atrial filling volume are augmented, suggesting an adaptive response of the atria to diminished left ventricular compliance.\r"

There were 728 men and the mean age of the entire group was 58 years (range 16 to 84). Coronary artery disease was the most common type of heart disease (56%) and 200 patients had no identifiable organic heart disease. The indication for study was a ventricular tachyarrhythmia or cardiac arrest in 582 patients. Each patient underwent an initial (baseline) study and 444 patients underwent serial drug studies (2.7/patient). There was one death during these studies. Other major complications included arterial injury (0.4%), thrombophlebitis (0.6%), systemic arterial embolism (0.1%), pulmonary embolism (0.3%) and cardiac perforation (0.2%). Significant arrhythmic complications included catheter-induced permanent complete atrioventricular (AV) block in 1 patient, nonclinical atrial fibrillation that required therapy in 10 patients and severe proarrhythmic events in 12 (3%) of 397 patients undergoing drug studies for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Cardioversion was required for termination of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 179 baseline studies (53% of patients with inducible arrhythmia), and in an additional 35 patients, cardioversion was required at least once during follow-up studies. Although clinical cardiac electrophysiologic studies are associated with complications, the risks are small and acceptable.\r"

  ".W": "It was recently shown that supernormal conduction in the diseased His-Purkinje system is more common than previously thought, and is always associated with prolongation of refractoriness. To assess whether supernormal conduction could also occur in the accessory pathway of patients with ventricular pre-excitation, 21 patients with manifestly prolonged refractoriness in the accessory pathway were studied. Under these conditions, programmed atrial stimulation revealed a phase of supernormal conduction in 16 (76%) of the 21. Therefore, what was believed to be a nonexistent or exceptional physiologic event was shown to be a rather common finding, at least under certain circumstances. Supernormal conduction occurred in all 7 patients with an anterograde refractory period of 480 to 980 ms, and in 5 of 10 patients with a refractory period greater than 1.0 second or with no anterograde conduction. Supernormal conduction could not be demonstrated in four patients with a refractory period less than or equal to 440 ms, but appeared in all four patients after the refractory period was prolonged by a rapid rate of stimulation or administration of ajmaline. The electrophysiologic changes underlying the occurrence of supernormal conduction in the accessory pathway are similar to those previously reported for the bundle branch system. The demonstration of supernormal conduction in the accessory pathway may uncover the presence of concealed ventricular pre-excitation. Supernormal conduction over the accessory pathway may facilitate a rapid ventricular response during atrial fibrillation, even if the refractory period is prolonged.\r"

  ".W": "Definitive localization of accessory pathways is based on atrial activation patterns during orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia when retrograde conduction occurs exclusively through the accessory pathway. In some patients, supraventricular tachycardia cannot be induced or is deleterious. To determine whether accessory pathway sites can be identified accurately during ventricular pacing, retrograde atrial activation was assessed during orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular pacing at multiple cycle lengths in 41 patients with a single accessory pathway. To obviate retrograde fusion due to concomitant conduction through the normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction system that may obscure the location of the accessory pathway, the difference in conduction time from the site of earliest atrial activation to the His bundle atrial electrogram (delta A-SVT) was measured during orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia and compared with values observed during ventricular pacing (delta A-VP). Characteristic values for the delta A-SVT interval were identified for left lateral (66 +/- 17 ms), left posterior (50 +/- 8 ms), posteroseptal (33 +/- 7 ms), right free wall (22 +/- 15 ms) and anteroseptal (0 +/- 0 ms) accessory pathway sites. During ventricular pacing, the site with the earliest atrial electrogram was used to define the accessory pathway location only if the maximal value of the delta A-VP interval over the range of cycle lengths assessed was comparable with the value of the delta A-SVT interval characteristic of that region. Values of the delta A-SVT interval correlated closely with the maximal values of the delta A-VP interval (r = 0.91). With this approach, 40 (98%) of 41 accessory pathway sites were identified correctly during ventricular pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the mouse, coxsackievirus B3 also causes myocarditis. The differential susceptibility of different inbred strains of mice to coxsackie B3-induced myocarditis also appears to be under genetic control. This study details the histopathology of coxsackie B3 myocarditis in six different inbred strains of mice for the first 45 days after coxsackie B3 infection. These strains differ either in the haplotypes of their major histocompatibility complex or in their background genome. During the first 7 days after coxsackie B3 infection, there are dramatic differences among strains with respect to prevalence and severity of myocarditis. Focal zones of myocyte necrosis involving polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as contraction band injury appear to be the early manifestations of direct viral injury. Four of the six strains, though, continue to show myocardial inflammation after day 9. This late phase myocarditis is characterized by the emergence of mononuclear cells within healing foci of myocyte necrosis as well as a distinctive diffuse interstitial pattern of myocarditis. The strains that develop this late ongoing myocardial inflammation frequently produce heart-specific autoantibodies. Thus the pathologic features of murine coxsackie B3 myocarditis change over the course of the illness, and genetic susceptibility to both early and late phase myocarditis differs markedly among various mouse strains.\r"

Histochemical and ultrastructural abnormalities such as sarcomere lengthening and myofiber thinning have been noted in myocardium soon after the onset of ischemia and have been attributed to the mechanical stretching that occurs during ventricular systole. To test whether mechanical forces alone could produce the residual dysfunction seen in stunned myocardium, regional dyskinesia was produced in open chest dogs by six repeated intracoronary infusions of either potassium chloride, 0.2 mEq/min for 2.5 minutes, or lidocaine, a 10 mg bolus followed by 1 to 3 mg/min for 5 minutes. These dogs were matched with dogs that had six repeated coronary occlusions of 2.5 and 5 minutes' duration, respectively. Regional function was analyzed using fractional systolic shortening and the load-independent end-systolic pressure-length relation. Both potassium chloride and lidocaine produced regional dyskinesia that was similar to the dyskinesia produced by coronary occlusion. Although regional ventricular function after repeated coronary occlusions remained significantly reduced, function returned completely to normal within 5 minutes after the last drug-induced dyskinesia. In conclusion, regional dysfunction produced by potassium chloride and lidocaine does not produce residual dysfunction despite mechanical forces during systole similar to those seen during coronary occlusion.\r"

Although 11 (50%) of the 22 patients never received a countershock for a ventricular tachyarrhythmia and are still alive, the other 11 received one or more spontaneous countershocks. Nine patients (41%) experienced spurious shocks during the follow-up period. Assuming that the first shock for presumed ventricular tachyarrhythmia prevented death, the hypothetical cumulative survival of patients at 42 months would have been 34 +/- 14.1% in the absence of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator rather than the actual survival rate of 59 +/- 16.8%. The cumulative device survival of the 36 AID-B units was 92 +/- 5.62% at 15 months but diminished to 37 +/- 14.4% by 20 months. No unit lasted longer than 22 months. There were 12 battery depletions. The number of shocks emitted did not influence unit longevity. The manufacturer's elective replacement indicator is of uncertain validity. Six units remained active 7 to 17 months after surpassing their replacement indicator. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator prolongs the life of many patients with otherwise intractable arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four men and 10 women (mean age 50 years, range 28 to 69) were studied. Five patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia, three had a concealed accessory pathway with AV reentrant tachycardia and six had tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node. In the five patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, propafenone terminated reentrant tachycardia in three (the tachycardia was reinducible in one) and had no effect in two. In the three patients with a concealed accessory pathway, propafenone terminated reentrant tachycardia in all three and prevented reinduction of the tachycardia in two. In the six patients with tachycardia due to reentry within the AV node, propafenone terminated and prevented reinduction of reentrant tachycardia. Propafenone had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate, PA interval, AV node refractoriness or rate of reentrant tachycardia. Propafenone significantly (p less than 0.05) prolonged the AH, HV, QRS and ventriculoatrial intervals and decreased the AV node Wenckebach rate. Of the nine patients receiving long-term oral propafenone therapy, eight had a reduction of at least 90% in reentrant tachycardia during a mean follow-up period of 14.5 months (range 11 to 22); all eight patients had had noninducible reentrant tachycardia after intravenous propafenone. One patient had increased frequency of reentrant tachycardia; this patient had had inducible reentrant tachycardia after intravenous propafenone. In conclusion, intravenously administered propafenone terminated reentrant tachycardia in 85% of patients and prevented reinduction in 71%, with no adverse hemodynamic effects.\r"

Practical standards of performance with respect to the development, validation and clinical application of these decision aids are still in evolution, however, and a variety of ethical and legal issues have yet to be addressed. Despite the promise of computer decision aids, it remains to be seen whether their diffusion into medical practice will improve the quality and cost of health care.\r"

  ".W": "A biotin-avidin amplified ELISA was used to measure antigen-specific IgE for ragweed, representative members of the gourd family (watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, zucchini, and cucumber), and banana in the sera of 192 allergic patients, each with an IgE greater than or equal to 180 microns/ml. Sixty-three percent (120/192) of the sera contained antiragweed IgE, and of these patients, 28% to 50% contained IgE specific for any single gourd family member. In contrast, no greater than 11% of the sera positive for a given gourd or banana were negative for ragweed. Correlations between ragweed and gourd-specific IgE levels were significant (p less than 0.001), and correlation coefficients between any two gourds exceeded 0.79. In an ELISA system, the extracts of watermelon and ragweed inhibited each other in a dose-dependent manner; the resulting nonparallel inhibition curves indicate that some, but not all, of the allergens in the two extracts are cross-reactive. Isoelectric focusing of watermelon and ragweed extracts in narrow range gel (pH 4 to 6) followed by immunoblotting demonstrated six watermelon allergen bands with isoelectric points identical to those of ragweed allergens. Several remaining bands in the two extracts had differing isoelectric points, however. Six of 26 patients interviewed with watermelon-specific IgE reported developing oropharyngeal symptoms (itching and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat) after ingesting at least one of the study foods, whereas only one of 25 patients interviewed without detectable watermelon-specific IgE reported similar symptoms (p = 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We retrospectively reviewed all our consultations for evaluation of local anesthetic allergy from 1965 to 1985 to assess the safety and efficacy of skin testing and provocative test dosing with a variety of local anesthetic agents. Fifty-nine patients reported 70 reactions from the administration of six different local anesthetics. Fifty-four patients could name one or more local anesthetic agents they believed were responsible, and five patients named only \"caine\" drugs. Multiple reactions of the same type to the same agent were considered as one reaction. On the basis of their history of reaction, the patients were categorized as follows: anaphylactoid reactions (urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, or hypotension within 1 to 2 hours of exposure), possible anaphylactoid reactions (tachycardia, dizziness, syncope, breathlessness, or pruritus occurring within 1 to 2 hours of exposure), contact dermatitis (a typical eczematous skin eruption after appropriate cutaneous sensitization), and other reactions (nonanaphylactoid reactions other than those already described or those occurring more than 2 hours after exposure). Fifty-nine patients were administered local anesthetics after skin testing and provocative test dosing, including two patients who required intravenous lidocaine (Xylocaine; Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., Westboro, Mass.) acutely to control cardiac arrhythmias. These two patients had reported anaphylactoid reactions to oral antiarrhythmic drugs of the local anesthetic class. Despite the history of previous reactions, there were no positive skin tests or positive provocative drug challenges in any patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty-one subjects were matched according to their skin sensitivity to ragweed-pollen extract and the severity of ragweed-induced rhinitis during the previous season. Thirty subjects received budesonide, and 31 received beclomethasone dipropionate, 50 micrograms per actuation. A double-dummy technique was used to achieve blinding, since the aerosol canisters and adaptors were dissimilar. Subjects were instructed to keep rhinitis well controlled by starting intranasal trial medication as soon as symptoms became troublesome, two puffs into each nostril, when it was needed, up to four times per day. If this became inadequate, subjects received supplementary chlorpheniramine maleate, 4 mg. Nasal symptoms (none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3) and all medication use were recorded daily in a diary. Budesonide demonstrated better clinical potency than beclomethasone in that less was needed to maintain good control of nasal symptoms. Side effects were mild and transient for both groups.\r"

  ".U": "87223614\r", 
  ".W": "Ptychodiscus brevis toxin (PBTX) is produced by the organism Ptychodiscus brevis. This toxin causes a phenomenon that has come to be known as Florida red tide. It also stimulates neuronal sodium channels, resulting in activation of the cholinergic and adrenergic nerve endings of the autonomic nervous system in upper airway smooth muscle and rat vas deferens, respectively, as previously reported. It is the cholinergic stimulating action that has been implicated as a possible \"triggering\" event in bronchial asthma. This article concerns the investigation of whether PBTX may also affect lower airways and by what mechanism any contractile response to PBTX in lower airways may be induced. PBTX was found to elicit contractions in isolated canine lower airway smooth muscle. The threshold concentration was 0.15 microgram/ml, the peak response occurred at 6.0 micrograms/ml, and the concentration causing half-maximal response of the group was 0.57 microgram/ml. Pharmacologic analysis demonstrated that atropine (10(-6) mol/L) blocked the response to both PBTX and acetylcholine, tetrodotoxin (10(-7) mol/L) blocked the response to PBTX but not to acetylcholine, and verapamil (10(-5) mol/L) blocked the response to PBTX and reduced the response to acetylcholine. Four consecutive contractile responses to PBTX (3 micrograms/ml) produced rapid tachyphylaxis. The fourth contraction was 60% less than the initial response. A fifth response to PBTX after exposure to indomethacin (2.8 X 10(-6) mol/L) was increased and resulted in a contraction that was only 25% less than the initial response. The exogenous addition of prostaglandins (PG), PGE1 and PGE2, to indomethacin-treated lower airway strips selectively suppressed the contractile response to PBTX. Other PGs tested (PGA2, PGB2, PGD2, PGF2 alpha and PGI2) did not affect the PBTX response. These results indicate that PBTX produces spasm in lower airway smooth muscle and that it does this by stimulation of sodium channels in the cholinergic nerve fibers. The results also demonstrate a rapid reduction in the contractile response to PBTX. The results also demonstrate that the reduction is mediated by PGs of the E series.\r"

  ".W": "We speculated that changes in endogenous prostaglandin synthesis might be responsible for the syndrome of premenstrual asthma (worsening of asthma in relation to menstruation). To test our hypothesis, we compared the effects of sodium meclofenamate, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, and placebo on premenstrual asthma in a 4-month, double-blind, crossover study of 17 women with asthma. Day-by-day evaluation revealed that peak expiratory flow reached a nadir during menstruation on both meclofenamate and placebo therapy and varied inversely with menstrual symptoms and asthma symptoms. Meclofenamate therapy resulted in significant improvement in peak expiratory flow during the early premenstrual period but had no treatment effect on the exacerbation of asthma during the late premenstrual period and early menstruation. The overall improvement in pulmonary function caused by meclofenamate therapy was correlated with the treatment effect on menstrual symptoms. Meclofenamate caused a small, nonsignificant decrease in use of theophylline and oral beta-agonist agents, whereas corticosteroid use increased slightly but not significantly. This study demonstrates the temporal relationship between menstrual symptoms and asthma. The study also demonstrates that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis does not prevent exacerbation of asthma in relation to menstruation.\r"

We have examined the effects of these variables on serum IgE in a community population cohort of 1109 subjects during a longitudinal study in which two serum samples were obtained 8 years apart from each subject. For the entire cohort, mean serum IgE level changed little during the follow-up period (28.9 versus 26.0 IU/ml). Most of the decreases were observed in children and young adults. Subjects more than the age of 35 years demonstrated no systematic change in serum IgE levels. By the end of follow-up (when there were few subjects still less than 16 years of age), significant relationships of IgE to age could no longer be demonstrated in nonatopic subjects. Also, in the nonatopic subjects of this cohort, there were no significant differences in IgE levels between the sexes. Among atopic subjects, there was a clear tendency for IgE to decrease with age, with atopic women more than 35 years of age demonstrating greater declines in IgE levels during follow-up than men of comparable age. The IgE levels in atopic male subjects were significantly higher than in atopic female subjects after the age of 35 years. Smoking was associated with an elevation in serum IgE. In this cohort, the smoking effect appeared to be limited to male subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Subsensitivity to H1-receptor antagonists has been attributed to autoinduction of enzyme systems and increased clearance rates during chronic drug administration. We studied the changes in serum half-life values and clearance rates in dogs who were administered hydroxyzine, 0.7 mg/kg, intramuscularly, daily, for 150 days. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on the first day of drug administration, and on days 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150. The mean serum half-life value on day 30, 60, and 120 was significantly longer (p less than 0.05) than that of 2.4 +/- 0.3 hours obtained on day 1. The mean clearance values obtained on days 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 were significantly slower (p less than 0.05) than the value of 25.12 +/- 4.13 ml/min/kg obtained on day 1 but were not significantly different from each other. Mean serum hydroxyzine concentrations were often significantly higher on the later study days than on day 1. The mean apparent volume of distribution values obtained on days 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 did not differ significantly from the value of 5.0 +/- 1.5 L/kg obtained on day 1. This study adds to the mounting evidence that subsensitivity to the effects of an H1-receptor antagonist is not due to autoinduction of enzyme systems, more rapid clearance of the drug, and lower concentrations of the drug in serum and tissue.\r"

Ten adult subjects with asthma with positive skin tests to one or several pollens were selected. They received, in random order and double-blind manner, clonidine (two doses, each 75 micrograms) or placebo for 3 days, and then, after a 1-week washout period, they crossed over to the other treatment for 3 days. Treatment with clonidine reduced the area of wheal-and-flare reaction induced by allergen without significantly changing the blood pressure or the plasma cortisol level. There was a drop in the histamine content of leukocytes and in the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood after allergen challenge during the placebo treatment, whereas clonidine prevented these changes. The results suggest that treatment with clonidine can reduce the inflammatory reactions induced by allergens in subjects with extrinsic asthma.\r"

Although there were large interpatient variations, the levels of serum been venom specific IgG were found to significantly correlate with the protection of the allergic patients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out to determine whether passive immunization with fractionated IgG from a beekeeper's serum pool was able to protect patients undergoing a rush immunotherapy program with HBV against untoward systemic reactions, and to observe if the active immunization with HBV could elicit an active IgG immune response toward venom allergens. Hyperimmune IgG was obtained from a pool of sera of beekeepers (Cohn fractions II to III) that was subsequently treated with pepsin for intravenous use. All IgG subclasses were found to be present in the preparation. Twenty-seven patients, highly allergic to HBV, were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. Twenty patients received 10 to 15 gm of fractionated IgG, and seven other patients received saline in a double-blind fashion. The next day, a 3-hour rush protocol attempted to reach a cumulative venom dose of 200 micrograms; 16/20 patients who received the fractionated IgG reached this dose without any systemic reaction, whereas none of the seven subjects who received saline could attain it, and all patients had a systemic reaction. The active immunization with HBV elicited a significant (p less than 0.05; Wilcoxon W Test) increase in venom IgG after 1 week of treatment in the patients who reached the maintenance dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to evaluate whether the cat allergen 1 content is a significant contribution to the allergenic activity of the extract, 17 cat-allergic subjects were tested by prick test with a purified preparation of cat allergen 1. The mean (range) concentration that produced a 3 mm wheal was 0.01 (0.0013 to 1.33) U/ml. Therefore, the commercial house dust extracts studied, when these extracts were diluted to a concentration commonly used for prick testing, would frequently contain enough cat allergen 1 to produce strong prick test reactions in cat-allergic subjects. It is difficult to justify the use of such commercial dust extracts as diagnostic reagents. For comparison purposes, nine dust samples from an apartment housing two cats were similarly analyzed. Cat allergen 1 was measurable in seven samples with a mean (range) of 23.8 (1.8 to 64.3) U/gm. Cat albumin could be measured in all nine samples with a mean (range) of 32.3 (0.16 to 70.8) U/gm.

  ".W": "Subsequent use of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) preparation may be considered in some instances in a patient who has demonstrated a suspected or proven allergic reaction to corticotropin on prior administration. We describe a patient with multiple sclerosis with a history of anaphylaxis to porcine ACTH in whom another course of treatment with ACTH was being considered. The patient had immediate cutaneous reactivity to porcine ACTH but not to the synthetic ACTH peptide, cosyntropin. With a test-dose schedule, we were able to uneventfully administer cosyntropin to the patient. The presence of serum IgE antibody directed against porcine ACTH and absence of IgE antibody against cosyntropin were demonstrated by ELISA technique, corroborating the skin test results. These studies are consistent with previous evidence that immediate hypersensitivity reactions to corticotropin are IgE mediated and support the value of skin testing in the clinical evaluation and management of known or suspected corticotropin hypersensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "A study of treatment practices of pediatric centers managing hereditary fructose intolerance and a review of recent literature on this subject were undertaken in an attempt to establish the degree of dietary liberalization allowable with age and the acceptability of foods containing trace amounts of fructose. The information was needed to plan optimal therapy and thus avoid the consequences of the disorder, namely intestinal dysfunction, metabolic imbalance, and hepatic and renal damage. Fifty responses to 113 letters to centers in Canada and the United States, as well as data from The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, identified only 29 affected children and provided information on their care, including food lists and literature references. Major principles of treatment were similar, but the approach to allowing and quantifying dietary fructose differed. In response to the apparent need for standardization of treatment, the authors formulated improved recommendations for the control of dietary fructose (less than 1.5 gm/day). Only a few foods of vegetable origin are allowed, including a limited selection of vegetables and cereal products from grain endosperm. Repeated dietary counseling is advocated with regard to allowed foods, sweeteners, and medications to ensure long-term dietary compliance.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was made of 1,080 singleton pregnancies of middle-class women to identify factors that influence outcome as measured by birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, and the incidence of complications. Increased birth weight was associated with increases in weight gain, maternal age, gestational age, maternal initial body weight, maternal hemoglobin and hematocrit values at 3 months, hemoglobin levels at 7 months, and socioeconomic status. For women whose initial weights were 90% to 135% of the standard, highest birth weights occurred when weight gains exceeded 29 lb. A 1 lb gain in maternal weight was associated with a 6 gm increase in birth weight. Birth weight was negatively correlated with a complicated obstetrical history and maternal cigarette smoking. Infants of heavy smokers weighed an average of 156 gm less than infants of nonsmokers. One-minute Apgar scores were significantly lower for infants of mothers who consumed alcohol and those who had had a complicated obstetrical history. Initial maternal weight and the husband's occupation positively influenced gestational age. There was no relationship between the incidence of maternal or infant complications and independent variables.\r"

Ninety-four samples were purchased from six chains in 10 cities throughout the United States. Vitamin content of breast and thigh meat portions differed, and slight differences in composition among brands were noted. Thiamin values for breast and thigh muscle, respectively, ranged from 0.062 to 0.136 and from 0.078 to 0.122 mg/100 gm; riboflavin, from 0.176 to 0.205 and 0.249 to 0.328 mg/100 gm; niacin, from 6.32 to 8.46 and 3.86 to 5.57 mg/100 gm; vitamin B-6, from 0.315 to 0.390 and 0.189 to 0.271 mg/100 gm; folacin, from 4.2 to 6.9 and 5.00 to 8.00 micrograms/100 gm; vitamin B-12, from 0.331 to 0.459 and 0.382 to 0.596 micrograms/100 gm; and pantothenic acid, from 1.48 to 1.68 and 1.58 to 1.77 mg/100 gm. Pressure-fried samples tended to have higher percentage moisture and lower percentage fat than crispy, open-vat fried samples. Fat ranged from about 15% to 20%.\r"

Ninety-four composite samples were selected from major chains in 10 cities. Starch contents were determined using a modified American Association of Cereal Chemists method. The amount of glucose formed during enzymatic hydrolysis was quantified either by a gas-liquid-chromatographic or a high-performance liquid chromatographic technique. The starch content ranged from 6% to 13% (wet weight basis). Moisture was determined by both microwave and vacuum oven methods; levels ranged from 38% to 49%. Analysis of variance for both starch and moisture indicated that starch was significantly (p less than .01) higher for light cuts than for dark cuts across all brands. Extra crispy recipes were significantly higher in starch than other recipes. Light cuts were significantly (p less than .01) lower in moisture than dark cuts. In addition, significant differences existed among brands. However, no significant difference was found between samples within a brand obtained from the five regions.\r"

Meat, dairy products, eggs, and grain products produced in Ohio have considerably lower selenium content than corresponding products produced in high selenium areas, such as South Dakota. Retail Ohio foods with interregional distribution tended to be higher in selenium content than corresponding foods produced in Ohio. Best sources of selenium in Ohio foods commonly consumed were meat and pasta products. Poor sources of selenium were fruits, most vegetables, candies, sweeteners, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Establishment of an accurate data base for selenium depends on knowledge of the interregional distribution of foods, the selenium content of foods at their production site, and the selenium content of foods with wide local distribution.\r"
