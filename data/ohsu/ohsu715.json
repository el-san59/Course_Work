Blocking the poorer ear with an earplug is said to significantly improve speech comprehension in daily life. Because of the theoretical and practical significance of these reports, we have attempted a replication. We studied patients with anterior temporal lobectomy because it was proposed that the underlying mechanism of monaural asymmetry and binaural interference in all clinical categories may involve temporal lesions or abnormal inhibition of one temporal lobe by the other. We were unable to confirm the previous reports.\r"

In a subsample of the two groups, matched for degree of cognitive impairment, the HD patients were found to be more apathetic than the AD group. Irritability was related to be the premorbid trait of \"bad temper\" in HD but not in AD. There was no interrelationship among the three symptoms in either group. The scales for irritability and apathy have both interrater and test-retest reliability. They are able to differentiate patients with AD and HD from normal, disease-free control subjects.

Twenty-one percent met diagnostic criteria for major depression, 20% had minor depression, and the remainder were not depressed. The frequency of depression showed a bimodal distribution over time, with highest frequencies occurring in the early and late stages of the disease. Although other factors such as a positive family history of psychiatric disorders, quality of social functioning, and severity of tremor, rigidity, and akinesia did not show a significant association with depression, depressed patients had significantly higher impairment scores in activities of daily living and cognitive function than nondepressed PD patients. There was also a significant correlation between impairment and depression scores. In addition, among patients with mainly unilateral symptoms, depression was significantly associated with greater left hemisphere involvement. These findings suggest that depression in the early stages of the disease may be related to left hemisphere dysfunction, while later in the disease, depression and impairment in activities of daily living are interrelated. This may indicate more than one etiology of depression or that depression may have an adverse impact on the course of the disease.\r"

Data for these veterans were obtained from military service records, the coroner's reports, and the psychological autopsy conducted with the decedents' family members. No military service factor was associated with suicide. The characteristics of Vietnam veteran suicide cases were not substantially different from non-Vietnam veteran suicide cases with respect to known demographic risk factors. The psychological profile of Vietnam veteran suicide cases are also similar to non-Vietnam veteran suicide cases in most instances. Symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder were observed more frequently among suicide cases than accident cases. However, suicides were not associated with specific combat experiences or military occupation. The extent of combat experience in Vietnam per se as measured in this study is not a good predictor of suicide death.\r"

We were unable to differentiate children with suicidal thoughts from those who attempted suicide on the basis of clinical symptoms alone. Both groups had similar high levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, and irritability. Conduct disorders were less common in both groups but 22% of the attempters abused illicit drugs or alcohol. Suicide attempts were more likely to be associated with chronic family discord and substance abuse. For boys, the odds of suicidal attempts were substantially increased if the subject had experienced loss. Results are discussed with reference to antecedents that may increase the odds of suicidal attempt and suggestions for future research are outlined.\r"

Because most MPD patients usually conceal their condition, there are only limited periods in their lives when they show florid, overt symptoms that can be easily diagnosed. During these other times, MPD patients often show subtle dissociative signs in their affects, thoughts, memories, behaviors, object relations, and transferences. These indirect manifestations of MPD are evidence of the patient's dissociative pathology and occur when their alters influence each other, partly emerge, or subtly shift. A familiarity with these subtle dissociative signs would allow the therapist to be aware of what MPD looks like when it is camouflaged and expressed indirectly. A recognition of these indirect manifestations would enable the clinician to suspect the diagnosis, explore the possible alters, and diagnose the patient's underlying dissociative pathology when present.\r"

Any relationship is arguably complex, and this area of research would benefit from attempts to clarify the relationship. This paper addresses the issue of complexity by examining the relationship between specific mood disorder categories and symptoms and six conceptually different indicators of violent behavior. Relationships are analyzed in logistic regression models where demographic and problem drinking variables are included to control variation that may be accounted for by these factors. The study uses a sample of 1140 recently incarcerated male felons. Psychiatric disorder diagnoses are based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. There is evidence of a direct relationship between a lifetime diagnosis of dysthymia and an arrest or incarceration history for robbery as well as with multiple incidents of fighting since age 18. Recurrent depression was significantly associated with a robbery incarceration history. Depression symptoms (regardless of whether a disorder diagnosis was made) were associated with multiple incidents of fighting since age 18. Manic symptoms were inconsistently associated with \"expressive\" violence and a number of mood disorder/violence models showed no significant relationship between the two.\r"

There was a significant stressful life events x Type A interaction, indicating that the Type As tended to possess physical symptoms even when stressful life events decreased.

Mass spectrometers are accepted as reliable monitors of end-tidal nitrogen for detection of venous air embolisms. We evaluated an inexpensive emission spectrometer for detecting changes in nitrogen levels and compared it with a mass spectrometer for detecting increased end-tidal nitrogen levels in dogs with venous air embolisms. During in vitro gas flow studies (helium; oxygen; helium/oxygen mixtures; or 70% nitrous oxide/30% oxygen with 0, 1, 2, or 3% isoflurane), air boluses (0.01 to 5.0 ml) were injected into a gas flow circuit and outlet nitrogen levels were measured by a Collins 21232 emission spectrometer. Responses were greater after each bolus when helium rather than oxygen was the major diluent gas. During in vivo studies, 5 dogs were anesthetized, ventilated, denitrogenated, and given venous air embolisms (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 ml.kg-1) during oxygen and then during Heliox (20% oxygen:80% helium) breathing. End-tidal nitrogen increased approximately two-fold after venous air embolisms given during Heliox as compared with oxygen ventilation. In all 0.1-ml.kg-1 venous air embolisms end-tidal nitrogen increased when the emission spectrometer was used, but venous air embolisms less than 1.0 ml.kg-1 were not consistently detected by mass spectrometry. Emission spectrometry can be used to detect increased end-tidal nitrogen levels indicative of venous air embolism and may be a more sensitive detector than mass spectrometry.\r"

  ".W": "The long sampling tubes required for remote mass spectrometry alter the sampling system's performance characterized by sample flow, residence time, and 10 to 90% response time. We searched for an easy-to-handle tube with (1) a length of 30 m, (2) sample flow less than 50 ml.min-1, and (3) residence and response times approaching those predicted by our mathematical model. We tested tubes of various geometries and various commercially available materials by using them as inlet catheters for a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Centronic 200 MGA, Centronic Ltd, Craydon, UK). We measured their responses at 0 to 10% (on transients) and 10 to 0% (off transients) step changes in gas concentration for nitrogen, argon, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and carbon dioxide and 0 to 3% and 3 to 0% for halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane. With 5 polyethylene tubes, halothane response times were up to 38 times longer than predicted. One 30-m polyethylene tube combined a 158-ms response time for nitrogen and argon with a 2,205-ms response time for halothane. Teflon, polyvinyl chloride, and stainless steel also proved to be unsuitable because of unacceptable signal distortion: the carbon dioxide response time for a 30-m Teflon tube was 2,600 ms. A glass tube showed the least signal distortion but was hard to handle. Our requirements were fulfilled by a 29.77-m tube made from nylon with a 1.00-mm inside diameter to which a 0.23-m length of nylon with a 0.25-mm inside diameter was added at the patient end. It offers (1) sample flow equals 46 ml.min-1, (2) residence time equals 11.1 seconds, and (3) response times approaching our theoretical predictions, that is, 159, 164, 180, 159, 188, 302, 298, and 300 ms (means of on and off transients) for nitrogen, argon, nitrous oxide, oxygen, carbon dioxide, halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane, respectively. This tube allows the accurate monitoring of breathing frequencies up to 25 and 50 breaths/min for volatile agents and gases, respectively.\r"

We compared the pulse oximeter method of measuring systolic blood pressure with the cuff methods using Korotkoff sounds and Doppler ultrasound as well as with direct pressure measurement through an intraarterial cannula. Systolic blood pressure values obtained by pulse oximeter correlated well with values obtained by other conventional methods. The best correlation was found with Doppler ultrasound (r = 0.996) and the worst with arterial cannulation (r = 0.880). We conclude that this method can be used intraoperatively to measure systolic blood pressure.\r"

In one patient with a diagnosis of Arnold-Chiari type I malformation with outflow obstruction of the fourth ventricle, a major pulmonary air embolism occurred while the patient was undergoing suboccipital craniectomy and cervical laminectomy in the prone position. Three hours after the incision the optode-displayed oxygen tension decreased from a stable value of 225 +/- 8 mm Hg to 63 mm Hg over a 10-minute period. During the same interval, carbon dioxide tension increased and end-tidal carbon dioxide decreased; shortly thereafter, transcutaneous oxygen tension decreased also. Within 20 minutes after the inspired gas mixture was changed to 100% oxygen, the patient's respiratory variables returned to near baseline. No further complications ensued. This is the first time continuously monitored arterial oxygen tension values during a pulmonary embolism have been reported. With further refinement, intraarterial optode probes will add another valuable method of detecting pulmonary air embolism.\r"

Factors affecting the ideal performance of the sensor are analyzed.

  ".U": "90111776\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies of patients with infiltrating ductal breast cancer treated with conservative surgery (ie, limited excision) and radiotherapy have indicated that the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC) in the excision specimen is highly associated with subsequent breast recurrence. The reason for this association is not clear, but possible explanations include the presence of more extensive disease in the breast or increased radiation resistance among tumors with an EIC (EIC+) compared with those without (EIC-) tumors. To investigate this association further, we related the presence or absence of an EIC in the primary tumors of 214 women who underwent mastectomy to the likelihood of finding additional foci of cancer in their mastectomy specimens using a correlated pathologic-radiologic mapping technique. Primary tumors that were EIC+ were significantly more likely to have carcinoma in the remainder of the breast than those which were EIC--(74% v 42%; P = .00001). This difference was primarily due to the presence of residual intraductal carcinoma. Seventy-one percent of EIC+ patients had residual intraductal carcinoma compared with 28% of EIC-patients (P less than .00001). In particular, 44% of EIC+ patients had \"prominent\" residual intraductal carcinoma compared with 3% of EIC-patients (P less than .00001). We conclude that patients whose tumors contain an EIC more frequently have a large subclinical tumor burden in the remainder of the breast compared with patients whose tumors do not contain an EIC. This observation may explain the association between EIC and subsequent breast recurrence when patients are treated with a limited excision before radiotherapy.\r"

A transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) was planned on day 42. Seventy-nine percent had T2 primaries by clinical staging and 56% had enlarged regional nodes (N) on computed tomographic (CT) scan. Forty-one patients completed the preoperative treatment and went to surgery (95% operability rate), and 36 (84%) were completely resected. Ten of the 41 operative candidates had no evidence of tumor in the resected esophagus and nodal tissue (tumor0 node0; T0N0), 24% complete response (CR). Myelosuppression was the major toxicity with grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 93% of patients and two preoperative treatment-related deaths. At a median follow-up of 26 months, the median survival time (MST) of all 43 patients registered on study has not been reached. The MST of the 36 completely resected patients and the 10 complete responders has not been reached; 70% and 100%, respectively, are alive at 24 months. The MST by histology is 21 months for the 22 squamous patients and has not been reached for the 21 adenocarcinoma patients registered on study. In a prognostic factor analysis, clinical N status, histology, and the percent of cisplatin and vinblastine tolerated were significant predictors for survival. These survival results suggest a significant improvement over the 14-month MST observed in our previous trial using preoperative chemotherapy only in a similar patient population, and a 12-month MST in a historic control group undergoing THE. A randomized trial is now in progress to convincingly determine if survival is prolonged by this therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Metastatic neuroblastoma is a childhood malignancy that is frequently responsive to chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, and teniposide (VM26), among other drugs, but in the majority of treated patients, the tumor recurs during or after chemotherapy. In this work, we have examined the hypothesis that the development of resistance to chemotherapy in neuroblastoma might be related to the expression of the human MDR1 gene, which encodes a multidrug transporter that functions as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. RNA samples from 49 neuroblastomas were analyzed, including 31 from untreated and 18 from treated patients. MDR1 RNA was detectable in the majority of treated and untreated tumors using a sensitive, semiquantitative slot blot assay. Of the samples from treated patients, five of 18 were found to have high MDR1 RNA levels, whereas only three of 31 from untreated patients had high MDR1 levels, a statistically significant difference (P less than .01). These results show that high levels of MDR1 RNA are often associated with resistance to chemotherapy in neuroblastoma and suggest that they may contribute to this resistance. Many of the neuroblastoma samples were also evaluated for N-myc amplification but there was no correlation between N-myc copy number and the level of MDR1 mRNA expression.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a phase II trial of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (DDP) and etoposide (VP-16) in stage III and IV newly diagnosed ovarian carcinoma patients with residual disease of any size. Twenty-three patients were entered, 19 had stage III and four stage IV disease. DDP 200 mg/m2 and VP-16 350 mg/m2 were given in 2 L saline IP via a Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia-Deltec, St Paul, MN). Sodium thiosulfate 4 g/m2 was given intravenously (IV) just before the start of IP instillation, and continued as a constant IV infusion of 2 g/m2/hr IV for a total of 6 hours. Treatment was given once every 4 weeks; six cycles of therapy were planned. Thirteen patients (56%) were in complete clinical remission at the end of treatment (normal physical exam, computed tomographic [CT] scan, CA-125, and peritoneal cytology). Seven of these 13 underwent a second-look laparotomy: three (13%) were in pathologic complete remission and four (17%) had microscopic disease only. Projected survival is 68% at 27 months, with 10 patients being alive and continuously free of disease. There was a very rapid fall in mean CA-125 to within normal limits at the end of the second course of treatment. The major toxicity was myelosuppression with median nadir WBC, granulocyte, and platelet counts of 2,600, 896, and 205,000/microL, respectively. There was no cumulative renal damage, anemia, hypomagnesemia, or chemical peritonitis. Neurotoxicity was similar to that observed with IV dosing. We conclude that therapy with the IP DDP/VP-16/IV thiosulfate regimen, in which all cytotoxic drugs are given only by the IP route, produces less anemia and renal damage than standard IV DDP-containing regimens, and that survival with this regimen appears to be at least as good as that produced by IV programs.\r"

  ".W": "To define both the toxicity and efficacy of intraperitoneal mitoxantrone in the treatment of refractory ovarian carcinoma, 31 patients were entered onto a phase II trial of this agent delivered in a 2 L treatment volume on a monthly basis. Due to excessive local pain at the initial dose level (30 mg/m2), the amount of drug delivered with each treatment course was reduced to 20 mg/m2. Despite this reduction, 74% of patients required narcotic analgesia during treatment. In addition, there were four episodes of bowel obstruction (one requiring surgical intervention) during therapy, and two patients developed bowel obstruction and intraabdominal abscesses following the completion of treatment. Six of 18 evaluable patients (33%) whose largest tumor diameter was less than or equal to 1 cm at protocol initiation experienced surgically documented responses, compared with one of 11 patients (9%) whose largest tumor was greater than 1 cm in diameter. If the two patients exhibiting what we called a mixed response to treatment are included, seven of 21 patients previously treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin responded to this treatment program, including four patients who had failed to respond to intraperitoneal cisplatin. No responding patient has demonstrated clinical evidence of relapse with a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 3+ to 13+ months) from response laparotomy. Intraperitoneal mitoxantrone is an active treatment program in patients with small-volume refractory ovarian carcinoma, but local toxicity can be severe. Due to the toxicity encountered with this specific program, its use cannot be recommended for standard clinical practice. However, in view of the activity observed in refractory ovarian carcinoma, including responses in patients who had previously failed intraperitoneal cisplatin, it is important to continue to explore alternative therapeutic regimens using intraperitoneal mitoxantrone to reduce local toxicity while maintaining or improving efficacy.\r"

However, this regimen given to patients with refractory disease was uniformly complicated by toxicities requiring major dose reductions. The present study was designed to determine if intermittent high-dose IFN-alfa would preserve efficacy and decrease toxicity in a similar patient population. Twenty-four patients with advanced disease refractory to one or more standard therapies received IFN-alfa, 10 MU/m2 IM on day 1 followed by 50 MU/m2 IM on days 2 to 5 every 3 weeks; after the first four cycles, stable and partially responding patients underwent dose escalation to twice the starting dose. One complete (CR) and six partial responses (PRs) were observed (response rate, 29%; 95% confidence interval, 13% to 51%) lasting 4 to 19 months (median, 8 months). No improvement in objective response was seen in the eight patients who received dose escalation. Dose reductions were necessary in eight of 22 patients receiving one or more cycles of therapy. Weighted mean dose rate intensity for patients on this study over the first four cycles of treatment was 65.5 MU/m2/wk compared with 73.2 MU/m2/wk over the first 12 weeks of treatment in patients from the previous study, in which all 19 patients receiving more than 1 week of treatment required dose reduction. IFN-alfa is effective against previously treated MF and the SS and is better tolerated on this intermittent schedule.\r"

  ".U": "90111783\r", 
  ".W": "Based on the results of a retrospective study, which found blood vessel invasion to be the most important prognostic factor in clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular germ cell cancer (NSTGCC I), a prospective study was started in 1985 which assigned NSTGCC I patients without evidence of vascular invasion to surveillance and patients with vascular invasion to two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Twenty-two patients entered the surveillance group and 18 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median follow-up is 30 months (3 to 50 months). Relapses occurred in three patients (7.5%), one in the surveillance group (4.5%), two in the chemotherapy group (11%). Thirty-eight patients (95%) are alive and without evidence of disease. Two patients of the adjuvant-treated group died, one of progressive germ cell cancer and one of lung cancer. We conclude that low- and high-risk NSTGCC I patients can be identified by considering blood vessel invasion. The presence of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion seem to be interrelated prognostic factors, because in 94% of vessel invasion the invading element was embryonal carcinoma. The exclusion of patients with vascular invasion from surveillance decreases relapse rates remarkably. Adjuvant chemotherapy diminishes relapse rates in high-risk patients but does not entirely prevent relapse.\r"

  ".W": "To date, the prevalence and nature of the late toxicity of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for advanced testicular cancer has been poorly documented. Thirty men with a median age of 35 years (range, 23 to 63), who had undergone such treatment were assessed with detailed investigation to determine the type and frequency of chronic toxicity. The median follow-up from the time of commencement of chemotherapy was 75 months (range, 48 to 126). The most common late toxic effects were high tone hearing loss in 23 men (77%) and electrophysiological evidence of peripheral nerve damage in 15 (50%). Both the hearing and nerve abnormalities were predominantly asymptomatic. In addition, elevation of serum cholesterol, noted in 20 patients (67%), was significant (P = .014) when compared with a control population. Hyperuricemia was present in nine patients (30%). Only one patient, with other risk factors (smoking, family history), had evidence of ischaemic heart disease while 20% (all with a smoking history) had a diminished single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is relatively free of major long-term side effects and should not be withheld for fear of late toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one patients with advanced germ cell malignancy who had either failed to achieve complete remission with initial cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy or who had relapsed after complete response (CR) to this therapy and then proven refractory on retreatment, were treated with etoposide (75 mg/m2 for 3 days), dactinomycin (1 mg/m2 day 1), and methotrexate (30 mg/m2 day 1) (EAM) every 3 weeks. Courses were continued until maximum response without empirical limit, and if complete remission was achieved, two courses of consolidation therapy were given before cessation of treatment. Thirteen patients (25%) were complete responders with residual masses containing fibrosis or benign teratoma being subsequently resected in seven patients. Two patients had persisting viable carcinoma within residual masses that were completely resected, leaving no evidence of disease (NED); the combined CR plus NED rate was 29%. The only pretreatment factor significantly influencing this response rate was tumor volume. Toxicities were moderate, with leukopenia being observed in 28% of patients, but it was severe in only 2%. There was one death from septicemia. Severe nausea and vomiting occurred in only 9% of patients and treatment-related stomatitis was observed in 42%. All patients achieving CR plus NED have been followed for a minimum of 5 years and no relapses have occurred, suggesting that these patients are cured. Unlike other regimens of salvage chemotherapy, this treatment program did not contain cisplatin and it is contended that a completely noncrossresistant drug regimen based on etoposide provides the opportunity to further improve the curability of patients with advanced germ cell cancer.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the subsequent evolution of neurologic, neuropsychologic, and intracranial anatomic findings in long-term survivors of small-cell cancer, we repeated an evaluation done 4 years previously in patients 6 to 13 years after treatment. Fifteen patients were reevaluated with a history and physical examination, mental status examination, neuropsychologic testing, computed cranial tomographic (CCT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All but one was ambulatory and none were institutionalized. Thirteen of 15 had neurologic complaints, 10 of 15 had an abnormal neurologic examination, seven of 14 had an abnormal mental status examination, 12 of 14 had abnormal neuropsychologic testing, 12 of 15 had abnormal CCT scans, and seven of 15 had white-matter abnormalities on MRI scans. No dramatic decline in performance status, functional status, neurologic symptoms, or neurologic examination occurred in these patients with 4 years of additional follow-up. More patients showed a decline in mental status examinations and neuropsychologic testing than demonstrated improvement. Anatomic studies showed no dramatic changes in the CCT scans and MRI confirmed these findings. From these data we conclude that there is a slow decline in neuropsychologic function in some of the patients surviving more than 6 years from a diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. The anatomic abnormalities documented by CCT scans and MRI are more frequent in patients with abnormal neuropsychologic function.\r"

  ".U": "90111797\r", 
  ".W": "One of the objectives of Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG) study 141 (CCG-141) was to determine the frequency of occult testicular leukemia (TL) after 3 years of disease-free survival (DFS) and to retreat boys with occult TL to prolong their subsequent DFS. Of the 494 boys entered on study, 255 (51.6%) were in complete continuous remission (CCR) 3 years after entering remission and an additional eight were in CCR 3 years after localized extramedullary relapse and retreatment; 263 boys were eligible for testicular biopsy. Elective testicular biopsy was performed on 235 (89.4%) boys. Of the 204 (86.8%) boys with negative biopsies, 175 (85.8%) remained in CCR 10 to 12 years after diagnosis and 25 (12.3%) relapsed, 11 (44%) of whom died. Isolated overt TL occurred in four (2.0%) and all remained in CCR 22+ to 60+ months after re-treatment. Of the 26 boys with occult TL, 16 (62%) remained in CCR. Ten (38%) relapsed despite local testicular irradiation and systemic re-treatment; six of the 10 died. Of the 26 boys who did not undergo biopsy, 21 (80.8%) remained in CCR; two (7.7%) developed isolated overt TL. DFS after testicular biopsy was significantly better in boys without occult TL (P = .001). Occult TL after 3 years of CCR represents aggressive minimal-residual disease and carries a worse prognosis than absence of TL. Initial treatment should be directed at obviating occult and overt testicular relapse. Conventional therapy as used in this study was suboptimal in preventing subsequent bone marrow (BM) relapse and death. If occult TR is identified during or at the end of planned therapy, a higher salvage rate may require intensified alternate therapy. As such, testicular biopsies may be clinically useful. Further investigation is limited by the relative rarity of, and the lack of identifying features in boys with occult TL.\r"

  ".U": "90111798\r", 
  ".W": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a very rare tumor in children in the United States, is apparently more common among Brazilian children. We reviewed the medical records of 40 children whose disease was diagnosed between 1966 and 1987. There were 12 boys and 28 girls; their median age was 3.9 years (range, 1 day to 15.7 years). Virilization was the most common clinical sign (37 of 40); other signs included abdominal mass, deepened voice, plethora, hypertension, seizures (seven patients) and, rarely, weight loss (two patients). The median time between first signs or symptoms and diagnosis was 1.4 years (range, 3 days to 5 years). Four of 33 tumors were classified as benign according to the Weiss, van Slooten, or Hough systems (tumor tissue was unavailable for seven patients). Tumors were completely resected in 26 of 38 patients; of those, 17 are in continuous complete remission, five relapsed, and four have been lost to follow-up. One patient, who had local recurrence, has been in a third complete remission for 18+ months after tumor resection and chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide). Of the remaining 14 patients, 11 died of progressive disease, the diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy in two, and one has been lost to follow-up. Univariate analysis disclosed that age greater than or equal to 3.5 years at diagnosis, interval of greater than or equal to 6 months between first symptoms and diagnosis, tumor weight greater than 100 g, tumor size greater than 200 cm3, and high levels of urinary 17-ketosteroids (17-KS) and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OH) were associated with an unfavorable outcome. Multivariate analysis disclosed that only a tumor size greater than 200 cm3 independently identifies those patients with an unfavorable prognosis. Among the variables known before surgery, age, and the interval between first symptoms and diagnosis were important predictors of outcome. Our data suggest that some children with ACC and certain clinical characteristics are at high risk of primary treatment failure and, therefore, are good candidates for investigational adjuvant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of close associations between recurring chromosomal abnormalities and the clinical behavior of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) have stimulated efforts to define this disease in cytogenetic terms. Here we report on the leukemic cell karyotypes of 155 children with ANLL who were treated from 1980 to 1987 in consecutive programs of chemotherapy at this institution. Of 121 cases with adequate banding, 20% were normal, 30% had miscellaneous clonal abnormalities, and 50% were classified into known cytogenetic subgroups: inv(16)/del(16q) (n = 15), t(8; 21) (n = 14), t(15;17) (n = 9), t(9;11) (n = 9), t(11;V)/del(11q) (n = 7) and -7/del(7q) (n = 6). The inv(16)/del(16q) cases showed a nearly equal distribution of myelocytic and monocytic French-American-British (FAB) subtypes; only four of these patients presented with M4Eo morphology. Despite a 100% remission induction rate, patients with inv(16)/del(16q)-positive ANLL fared no better overall than the entire group; only 40% of this subgroup were event-free survivors at 2 years from diagnosis (P = .23). Patients with inv(16)/del(16q) frequently had CNS involvement at diagnosis (eight of 15) or initially relapsed in this site (three of eight). Event-free survival (EFS) was clearly superior for young patients with FAB M5 leukemia and the t(9;11) (P = .041). These patients were clinically indistinguishable from others with the FAB disease subtype, yet their responses to etoposide-containing therapies were noteworthy. By contrast, children with structural abnormalities involving 11q23, other than t(9;11), were infants (median age, 6 months) with FAB M4 or M5 leukemia, hyperleukocytosis, and frequent coagulation abnormalities. Patients with such changes [t(11;V) or del(11q)] relapsed early during postremission therapy: none remained disease-free more than 16 months from diagnosis. Because of resistant leukemia, patients with monosomy 7/del(7q) had a poor remission induction rate (17%; P = .0015); patients with the t(15;17) were also poor responders to induction therapy (44%; P = 0.02) because of hemorrhagic deaths. These results identify several cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric ANLL that may represent unique disease processes for which more effective early cytoreduction [-7/del(7q), t(11;V)], better supportive care measures [t(15;17)], or more effective CNS prophylaxis [inv(16)/del(16q)] would be warranted.\r"

Arteriojugular venous oxygen differences and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were determined in a subgroup of 66 patients. The relationship between each of these variables and outcome at 6 months was analyzed, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. The CMRO2 was significantly depressed in patients who subsequently died or remained in a vegetative state, whereas higher values were obtained in patients who later regained consciousness. Although CBF was not predictive of outcome in the total sample, omission of patients with acute hyperemia resulted in a significant relationship that paralleled the metabolic findings. Follow-up studies in the survivors revealed a correlation between CBF and degree of functional recovery, the lowest blood flows being obtained among patients with severe disability. Age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and occurrence of intracranial hypertension were each found to be predictive of outcome, thus confirming previous reports. When these variables were combined with CMRO2 in a logistic regression analysis, the probability of recovery was correctly predicted in 82% of the cases. The CMRO2 was relatively independent of the other prognostic indicators and, next to age, contributed most to the prediction.\r"

  ".U": "90111828\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted to validate the retrospective finding that adolescents (11 to 15 years old) with skull fractures were prone to develop acute traumatic intracranial hematoma (ICH). Over a 4-year period, 1178 consecutive adolescents attended the emergency room directly, of whom 760 were discharged well and 418 were admitted. All underwent skull x-ray studies. Immediate computerized tomography (CT) scans were performed in patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of less than 15, in those with radiological and/or clinical evidence of skull fracture, and whenever clinically indicated. Of the 418 admitted patients, only 26 had skull fractures; 13 of these developed ICH. Four patients without skull fracture developed diffuse brain swelling. The remaining 401 patients were discharged after observation periods of up to 48 hours. Of the 13 patients with ICH, 10 had admission GCS scores of 15; however, four deteriorated rapidly and required urgent operation, and four remained stable but were operated on due to their large ICH. Two required conservative treatment only and both made good recovery. Three patients were in coma (GCS score less than or equal to 8) on admission. One patient had an epidural hematoma and made good recovery after surgery. Two developed delayed ICH after operations for associated systemic injuries despite initial CT showing diffuse brain swelling only, and both died despite evacuation of the ICH. Multivariate analysis showed that skull fracture was the only independent significant risk factor in predicting ICH in adolescents (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%). A routine skull x-ray study is therefore mandatory in all head-injured adolescents and, if a skull fracture is detected, immediate CT may be performed for early detection of ICH.\r"

In four patients, the second CT scan was obtained prospectively. The mean percentage of increase in the volume of hemorrhage between the first and second CT scans was 107% (range 1% to 338%). In each of the six patients with a greater than 40% increase in hemorrhage volume, neurological deterioration occurred soon after the first CT. A systolic blood pressure of 195 mm Hg or greater was recorded during the first 6 hours in five of the same six patients. The data from this study indicate that, in ICH, bleeding may continue after the 1st hour post-hemorrhage, particularly in patients with early clinical deterioration.\r"

  ".W": "The present report details the characteristics of the analgesic effects of morphine administered chronically by infusion pumps implanted in 53 patients suffering from terminal metastatic disease. The median postimplant survival time in these patients was 4 months. Patients (mean age 58 years) were characterized according to the duration of pain before pump implantation (mean 16 months), prior consumption of systemic opioids (mean one to six daily analgesic equivalents of morphine), and their response to a trial intrathecal dose of morphine (1 to 2 mg). The median infusion dose at 2 weeks was 3.8 mg/day. The analgesic index, calculated as (quality of pain relief x duration of pain relief in hours)/morphine dose in mg, that was observed after the trial dose of morphine was determined for each patient. A close correlation was observed between the acute (2-week) infusion dose necessary to produce pain relief and the analgesic index such that the infusion dose = -8.0 x log (analgesic index) + 17.1. By 16 weeks, the mean spinal morphine dose for the group had increased by a factor of about 2.5; however, significant variation in the dose incrementation was documented. The maximum increase was observed in patients with a low analgesic index, and this rapid incrementation was usually correlated with an unsatisfactory overall outcome. Evidence that long-term infusion continues to yield analgesia was evidenced in six cases where there was an unanticipated loss of drug infusion and a corresponding increase in parenteral narcotic consumption. These data indicate the long-term efficacy and safety of spinal opioid infusion in patients with terminal cancer, and emphasize the advantage of assessing the sensitivity of the patient to spinal opioids by a standardized trial injection prior to pump placement as a prognostic indication of outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients with ankylosing spondylitis and traumatic fracture/dislocation of the spine were identified in a retrospective review of all cases of cervical spine injury treated on the neurosurgical service over a 10-year period. Injury was most often secondary to minor trauma or a motor-vehicle accident, and the level of vertebral involvement was most frequently between C-5 and T-1. Neurological symptoms at presentation ranged from neck pain alone to complete loss of function distal to the level of injury. Initial routine treatment consisted of axial traction for realignment with the minimal weight needed to accomplish this, taking into account the flexion deformity. All patients underwent pluridirectional tomography and/or computerized tomography to delineate the exact sites of injury. Three patients died shortly after admission due to pulmonary complications. The remaining eight patients underwent early posterior stabilization and mobilization in a halo or cervicothoracic brace to achieve fusion. Neurological improvement was achieved in six of these eight cases. The experience described here supports the initiation of axial traction as initial therapy for cervical injuries followed by early surgical stabilization in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The difficulty of maintaining spinal alignment and the devastating pulmonary problems attendant on conservative management may be obviated by early fusion.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1982 and 1986, 27 patients with seizure disorders due to cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were surgically treated by the authors. These patients had no history or clinical manifestation of intracranial hemorrhage. All were treated with anticonvulsant agents by their neurologists but became disabled due to inadequate control of seizures by medication, side effects of the anticonvulsant drugs, or the effects on their professional lives of even infrequent seizures. The age of the patients ranged from 13 to 61 years. There were 13 males and 14 females. The AVM's were smaller than 2 cm in four patients, between 2 and 4 cm in five, and larger than 4 cm in 18. The most frequent location of the AVM's was in the temporal lobe, followed by the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. All patients had preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and intraoperative electrocorticography. Intraoperative recording of the amygdala and the hippocampus by depth electrodes was performed if the AVM's were located in the temporal lobe. Superficial or posterior temporal lobe AVM's often have remote seizure foci that involve the amygdala and hippocampus. All patients underwent craniotomy and total excision of their AVM's. Surgery was carried out under local anesthesia to allow localization by electrical stimulation if the AVM involved the speech area or the sensorimotor cortex. Based on the EEG findings, excision of the epileptogenic lesion in addition to the AVM was performed in 18 patients. In seven patients with AVM's located in the temporal lobe, remote seizure foci were identified and excised. The remote epileptic activity was particularly prominent in AVM's in the temporal lobe and usually involved mesial temporal structures. Microscopic study of excised seizure foci showed gliosis in 26 cases, hemosiderin deposits in 10, and focal hemorrhage in four. There were no operative deaths. Two patients developed a hemiparesis and three suffered temporary dysphasia after surgery. Two patients had visual field deficits. The results of postoperative seizure control during the average follow-up period of 3 years 11 months were excellent in 21 patients, good in three, fair in two, and poor in one. The latter patient, whose epileptic lesion was not completely excised because of its location in the motor cortex, had poor seizure control postoperatively. Another patient required a second operation to remove a remote seizure focus. In this series, proposed mechanisms of seizure associated with cerebral AVM include focal cerebral ischemia secondary to arteriovenous shunting, gliosis of the surrounding brain, and a secondary epileptogenesis in the temporal lobe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90111833\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of clot removal on cerebral vasospasm was studied in 104 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The series included patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the ictus; the patient's preoperative clinical grade was between Grades I and IV; there was no rebleeding; computerized tomography (CT) showed only SAH; and carotid angiograms were performed by Day 2 and repeated between Days 7 and 9. Both the degree of SAH on CT and angiographic vasospasm were graded from 0 to III. The relationship of the SAH grade in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure (IHF) to the presence of vasospasm at the A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery and the relationship of the SAH grade in the sylvian stems to the presence of vasospasm at the M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery were analyzed. Correlation of preoperative and postoperative SAH grades with the angiographic vasospasm grades, with the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, and with the low-density area on CT could be found in the A2 and M1 territories. Decrease of cisternal blood measured by CT after the operation did not relate directly to the reduction of vasospasm. When the SAH was Grade II or III in the basal frontal IHF, the angiographic vasospasm grades at the A2 were significantly lower in patients with surgery via the interhemispheric approach than in those with surgery via the pterional approach. Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in two of the eight cases operated on by the interhemispheric approach compared with 11 of the 22 cases approached via the pterional route. In patients with a pterional approach, there was no significant difference in severity of vasospasm in the M1 territory between the side of approach and the opposite side. No consistent relationship could be found between the time interval from SAH to operation and the severity of vasospasm. While clot removal may ameliorate cerebral vasospasm, its effect per se does not seem to be significant.\r"

  ".U": "90111834\r", 
  ".W": "Parkinsonism or hemiparkinsonism was induced by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in four rhesus monkeys, which then received homologous fetal mesencephalon implants into the caudate nuclei. Cavities were prepared in the medial caudate nucleus 2 to 5 weeks before the fetal grafts were implanted. Control studies were conducted in unoperated MPTP-treated animals. Significant behavioral improvement, which occurred within weeks of implantation of fetal mesencephalon, was sustained for up to 7 months. No recovery was seen in the unoperated control animals. Histological examination revealed numerous surviving tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive cell bodies. In addition to the graft, abundant TH-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the host caudate nucleus ventral to the region of the implanted and the nonimplanted cavities. Since TH-immunoreactive cell bodies of the substantia nigra compacta (A-9 cells) were destroyed by MPTP treatment and the ventral tegmental area (A-10) remained intact, it is concluded that sprouting of remaining host dopaminergic fibers occurs. These newly formed fibers appeared to emanate from the mesolimbic projection to the striatum. It is likely that the newly sprouted dopaminergic fibers account for the motor improvement elicited by precavitation and fetal mesencephalon implantation. These results suggest that the mechanism of recovery of parkinsonian primates after implantation of fetal dopaminergic tissue into the caudate nucleus is by stimulation of sprouting from host neurons. They also suggest that, with identification of the factors responsible for the formation of the new dopaminergic neuronal processes and with further development, tissue implantation may be an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease in humans.\r"

The effects of the drugs were measured on systemic physiological, neurological, and body-weight responses to injury. The animals were trained prior to injury and were assessed for 10 days after injury on body-weight responses and neurological endpoints. Low doses of naloxone (0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg) significantly exacerbated neurological deficits associated with injury. Morphine (10.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced neurological deficits associated with injury. The drugs had no effect on neurological measures or body weight in sham-injured animals. Drug treatments did not significantly alter systemic physiological responses to injury. Data from these experiments suggest the involvement of endogenous opioids in at least some components of neurological deficits following traumatic brain injury and suggest the possibility that at least some classes of endogenous opioids may protect against long-term neurological deficits produced by fluid-percussion injury to the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The silent corticotroph-cell adenoma (SCCA) is characterized by the presence of immunoreactive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the tumor tissue in patients without symptoms of Cushing's disease. To elucidate the pathophysiology of SCCA, the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (a ACTH precursor) genes was studied in a patient with SCCA and in three patients with Cushing's disease. Pro-opiomelanocortin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was found in the SCCA tissue to a greater degree than in the adenomas of the patients with Cushing's disease. Northern blot analysis revealed that the size of pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA present in the SCCA tissue was indistinguishable from that in the adenomas associated with Cushing's disease. A ribonuclease mapping study indicated that there were no point mutations in the coding sequence of pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA present in the SCCA tissue. Because of the presence of pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA and immunoreactive ACTH in the adenoma tissue, it is proposed that translation of the mRNA and subsequent accumulation of ACTH precursor occurred in the SCCA. Thus, the absence of Cushing's disease symptoms in this SCCA could not be caused by abnormality in the coding sequence of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene or in ribonucleic acid processing. The occurrence of abnormality at or after the translational steps was strongly suggested.\r"

For the in vitro studies, two cultured human glioma cell lines were investigated using MAb against DNA polymerase alpha, the MAb Ki-67, a serum against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA/cyclin), bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), and an anti-BUdR MAb. During exponential growth of the cells, the percentage of polymerase alpha-positive cells (the \"polymerase alpha score\") ranged from 72.0% to 77.1%, the Ki-67-positive cells (the \"Ki-67 score\") ranged from 43.4% to 59.4%, the PCNA/cyclin-positive cells from 30.9% to 41.4%, and the BUdR labeling index from 28.6% to 39.3%. For the in situ studies, tissue from 60 human brain tumors and from two normal human brains was investigated and the polymerase alpha scores and Ki-67 scores were compared. In normal brain tissue, no immunostaining was found by either method. In brain tumors, both the polymerase alpha scores and the Ki-67 scores correlated with the histological grade of malignancy. Polymerase alpha scores were generally higher than Ki-67 scores in the same specimen, especially in malignant brain tumors. These findings suggest that immunostaining of DNA polymerase alpha is a convenient and important new method by which to estimate the cellular proliferation rate of brain tumors. Polymerase alpha scores may be closer to the growth fraction of the individual tumor than the MAb Ki-67 or other scores.\r"

  ".W": "The factors responsible for the production of prolactin-secreting tumors are obscure. One hypothesis, that chronic loss of dopamine control from the hypothalamus may be associated with prolactinoma formation, was tested. Female adult Fischer 344 rats were subjected to ovariectomy and were then given subcutaneous implants of diethylstilbestrol (DES) Silastic capsules to produce lactotrophic hyperplasia. Sequential studies assessed the neuronal activity of the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (A12) during and after this estrogen-induced pituitary growth. Immunocytochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used as a marker for dopamine synthesis, plasma radioimmunoassay provided plasma prolactin levels, and magnetic resonance imaging and histological studies were performed to examine the structural changes occurring in the pituitary gland. Animals were sacrificed from 3 to 67 days after DES implantation. To determine the reversibility of the estrogen-induced changes, rats were also sacrificed at different time intervals after the removal of 30-, 40-, or 60-day DES implants. After 30 days of DES treatment, plasma prolactin levels increased 40-fold and pituitary weight increased more than threefold. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity diminished gradually and was almost completely depleted at 30 days. Pituitary histology revealed marked prolactin cell hyperplasia. These changes were completely reversible; removal of the capsule after 30 days resulted in eventual normalization of plasma prolactin levels and pituitary size and in restoration of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the A12 region. Sixty days of DES treatment produced large hemorrhagic tumors with sustained high plasma prolactin levels and an irreversibly distorted A12 area. These observations suggest that in these animals loss of dopamine regulation secondary to estrogen stimulation initially produces prolactin hyperplasia but that prolonged loss leads to adenoma formation.\r"

Only one patient had an inconspicuous focal neurological deficit that suggested a cerebral location. Initial diagnosis was acute meningitis in each case. A lumbar puncture was ordered in all three cases but was actually performed in two without developing tonsillar herniation. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of meningitis in one but was normal in the other. Computerized tomography allowed a precise diagnosis and localization of the pathology. All three patients received aggressive antibiotic therapy plus suboccipital craniectomy and aspiration of pus; catheter drainage was performed in two. Cultures were positive in one case and negative in the others. Two patients were cured without sequelae; the third patient was moribund at surgery and died. Although it is known that subdural empyemas may localize in the posterior fossa, only one previous report was found. Infratentorial subdural empyema may sometimes be an unrecognized companion of acute meningitis and is cured with antibiotic therapy alone.\r"

This case suggests that SPECT may enhance the sensitivity of the scintigraphic diagnosis of this uncommon condition, especially when the occlusion of the hepatic veins is incomplete.\r"

A retrospective study showed no significant differences between batches of kits with respect to radiochemical purity (RCP) or image quality. Up to 3000 MBq (81 mCi) pertechnetate could be added to the kit without adversely affecting RCP or image quality. It was shown that image quality was directly affected by RCP at time of injection and dropped sharply when RCP fell below 85%. Interstitial injection and mixing with blood prior to injection also resulted in poor image quality. Pretreatment with perchlorate reduced uptake of activity in the parotid glands; this improved image quality and reduced the influence of RCP.\r"

We therefore studied the possibility of localizing various soft-tissue sarcomas with 111In-labeled monoclonal antibody Fab fragments binding specifically to myosin, assuming that damage to the cell membrane could expose intracellular myosin. Nineteen patients with different types of soft-tissue sarcomas were studied. Eighteen patients were found to have abnormal antibody uptakes. Antibody uptake was not observed in an additional patient operated for a benign tumor (gastric leiomyoma). The immunoscintigraphy results were generally in good agreement with those of other radiologic findings (computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging). Surprisingly, the immunohistochemistry results showed that tumors not stainable for myosin can also be imaged with antimyosin. Thus, the mechanism of antibody uptake does not seem to be related entirely to specific antigen recognition. Irrespective of the exact mechanism for the uptake of labeled antibody this method appears to be useful for localizing soft-tissue sarcomas.\r"

Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine [( 123I]MIBG) was used to map scintigraphically the cardiac sympathetic neuronal function in six male subjects (aged 32 +/- 7 yr) after an exposure to high altitude that created hypoxic conditions. Results obtained just after return to sea level (RSL) were compared with the normal values obtained after 2 or 3 mo of normoxia (N). A static image was created as the sum of the 16-EKG gated images recorded for 10 min in the anterior view of the chest at 20, 60, 120, and 240 min after injection. Regions of interest were located over the heart (H), lungs (L), and mediastinum (M) regions. There was a significant decrease in the H/M and the L/M ratios in RSL compared to N condition. Plasma norepinephrine concentration was elevated during the stay at altitude but not significantly different in RSL compared to N. In conclusion, cardiac [123I]MIBG uptake is reduced after an exposure to altitude hypoxia, supporting the hypothesis of an hypoxia-induced reduction of adrenergic neurotransmitter reserve in the myocardium. Furthermore, the observed significant decrease in pulmonary MIBG uptake suggests an alteration of endothelial cell function after exposure to chronic hypoxia.\r"

One sequence was created using a sorting method that spans each individual cardiac cycle with the same number of images (the \"variable temporal\" or VT method), while the other (the \"fixed temporal\" or FT method) spans the average cardiac cycle with images of fixed temporal duration. Left ventricular time-activity curves were extracted from each sequence using identical regions-of-interest and analyzed with identical methods to obtain estimates of ejection fraction, peak ejection rate, peak filling rate, and the times of occurrence of these peak rates. Differences among certain of these parameters in kind and amount support the hypothesis that estimates of resting cardiac function are more accurately portrayed by the FT method. The magnitudes of these differences are small for systolic parameters but large for early diastolic parameters. Thus, although both methods might be used for measuring systolic function, the FT method will yield a more accurate estimate of peak filling rate in resting subjects.\r"

This study investigated short term precision by weekly scanning (three to five times) normal subjects (total 48 scans) and long term precision by scanning a whole-body phantom 30 times over 15 mo. For the 30 phantom scans, a coefficient of variation (CV) of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) was calculated for each region. Nonrandom changes were analyzed by plotting the phantom data with time and testing the slope of the fitted line for significance. Similarly for the subjects, a CV for each region and the mean value for all subjects was obtained. From this study we conclude (a) BMD is more precise than BMC, (b) long-term precision was poorer than short term, (c) long-term regional BMD precision (%) was: head, 3.2; arms, 2.8; legs, 1.6; ribs, 2.6; pelvis, 3.8; thoracic spine, 3.8; lumbar spine, 7.1; total spine, 2.4; trunk, 2.2; total body, 1.2.\r"

All patients were dosed with 5 mCi (18.5 MBq) of 131I p.o., and imaged 72 hr later. Ninety-five percent (20/21) of patients had nasal radioactivity greater than background, and in 75% (15/20) of positive patients the pattern of activity was round. Clinical follow-up of these patients has shown no evidence of tumor involvement in the nasal area. We conclude that nasal radioiodine activity is a normal finding.

We measured rCBV with 99mTc erythrocytes after rCBF with 133Xe, and calculated rCBV/rCBF. rCBF and rCBV of the 25 affected hemispheres were classified as (a) patients with normal rCBF [type I (n = 7) and type II (n = 3)]; (b) patients with decreased rCBF [type III (n = 6) and type IV (n = 9)]. These two groups then could be subdivided according to findings of rCBV, normal, and increased blood volumes. rCBV/rCBF increased as the cerebral perfusion pressure dropped from type I to type III. In type IV, other situations but cerebral autoregulation could be assumed. rCBV/rCBF signifies vascular mean transit time. Type III (high rCBV/rCBF) assumed as the increased OEF, misery perfusion as reported in PET. We propose rCBF, rCBV and rCBV/rCBF using SPECT can be an index for cerebral circulatory reserve.\r"

A strongly positive correlation between the ratio of the SPECT to CT volume defect sizes (SPECT divided by CT) and recovery following stroke was found, such that the greater the SPECT to CT ratio, the better the subsequent recovery of neurological deficits. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the best predictor of clinical outcome following stroke was the log-transformation of SPECT divided by CT. The results suggest that the relationship between the perfusion defects and tissue loss measured by SPECT and CT imaging may have prognostic utility following stroke limited primarily to cerebral cortex.\r"

During variable blood flow (0.15-2.44 ml/min/g), peak and net extraction (Emax and Enet, respectively), and capillary permeability-surface area product (PScap) were determined with paired indicator-dilution techniques. Serial bolus injections of 201Tl, [111In]albumin, and [99mTc]BATO; chloro[tris(cyclohexanedionedioxime)methyl boronic acid]Tc (SQ30217, n = 8) and a hydroxy-substituted derivative (SQ32014, n = 5) were given to a total of 13 hearts. Mean (+/- s.d.) SQ30217 Emax and Enet were 0.72 +/- 0.09 and 0.55 +/- 0.18, respectively, which were higher than thallium values of 0.57 +/- 0.10 and 0.46 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.03). Mean SQ30217 PScap was 1.1 +/- 0.4 ml/min/g and was also higher than corresponding thallium determinations (0.7 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.001). SQ32014 Emax, Enet, and PScap were all significantly less than thallium values (p less than 0.001). Thallium and SQ30217 values for Emax and PScap were closely correlated with blood flow (r greater than or equal to 0.73), whereas those for SQ32014 were weakly correlated (r = 0.09). A small clinical pilot study (n = 3) was performed, which showed that SQ32014 was a poor myocardial perfusion agent in man. In summary, transcapillary exchange of SQ30217 is greater than thallium, which in turn, is greater than SQ32014. Therefore, SQ30217 appears to have good clinical potential, but SQ32014 does not.\r"

  ".U": "90111873\r", 
  ".W": "The conventional approach to calculating tumor radiation dose from internally administered radioisotopes is by the MIRD schema. The raw input data for such dose calculations is obtained by immunoscintigraphic methods, PLANAR or SPECT imaging. Limitations in the spatial resolution of these techniques can lead to a considerable underestimate of the gross variation in tumor dose. The use of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies for therapy can result in large nonuniformities in tumor dose. This paper discusses how antibody distribution can influence the energy deposition in the nuclei of target cells. Heterogeneity of antibody binding will lead to an expected decrease in the effectiveness of the radiation delivered. However, enhanced cell killing is possible if the radiolabeled Ab binds to the cell surface membrane and may be further enhanced if the Ab is internalized. Calculations are presented for two cases: (a) a three-dimensional random packing arrangement of cells as a model of the astructural nondifferentiated form seen in some tumors, and (b) differentiated carcinoma of the colon with the cells in tubules. Results for the magnitude of the mean energy deposition to individual cell nuclei from: (a) cell membrane bound 211At, 199Au, 131I, and 90Y-labeled Abs, and (b) a uniform distribution of these sources, as a function of internuclear distance for the two histologies are presented. Energy deposition in tumor cell nuclei from membrane bound radiolabeled antibody may be several times greater than estimated with the assumption of a uniform source distribution.\r"

We evaluated freezing of three different 131I-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies at -70 degrees C, immediately following radiolabeling, as a method of diminishing autoradiolysis, and of preserving immunoreactivity. Freezing greatly limits the ability of radiation-induced free radicals to diffuse in solution and thus produce radiolytic damage. By freezing at -70 degrees C autoradiolytic damage of immunoreactivity of three different 131I monoclonal antibodies could be largely eliminated, in contrast to the 80-90% losses in immunoreactivity seen with storage at 4 degrees C for a period of 1 to 12 days. Reduced in vitro deiodination rates are also seen for frozen antibodies. Limited studies with 125I-labeled antibodies indicate autoradiolysis does occur, though at a slower rate per mCi than for 131I, and that this process is also retarded by freezing. Freezing may be valuable while quality control procedures are performed following radiolabeling as well as if temporary storage or shipment of radioantibodies prior to patient dosing is undertaken. While the approach should be validated for each antibody studied, freezing of therapeutic doses of monoclonal antibodies appears to be a simple and effective approach to the problem of autoradiolysis.\r"

However, normal regional myocardial blood flows are markedly heterogeneous, and it is not known how this heterogeneity affects regional metabolism or substrate uptake and thus image interpretation. In five instrumented dogs running at near maximal workload on a treadmill, 131I-labeled IPPA and 15-micron 46Sc microspheres were injected into the left atrium after 30 sec of circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Microsphere and IPPA activity were determined in 250 mapped pieces of myocardium of approximately 400 mg. Myocardial blood flows (from microspheres) ranged from 0.05 to 7.6 ml/min/g. Deposition of IPPA was proportional to regional flows (r = 0.83) with an average retention of 25%. The mean endocardial-epicardial ratio for IPPA (0.90 +/- 0.43) was similar to that for microspheres (0.94 +/- 0.47; p = 0.08). Thus, initial IPPA deposition during treadmill exercise increases in proportion to regional myocardial blood flow over a range of flows from very low to five times normal.\r"

  ".U": "90111902\r", 
  ".W": "Because feeding of cow milk causes normal infants to lose increased amounts of occult blood from the gastrointestinal tract, we conducted a prospective trial to measure intestinal blood loss quantitatively and to monitor iron nutritional status. Fifty-two infants entered the trial at 168 days of age and were assigned at random to receive either cow milk or a milk-based formula. Initially, 31 infants had been breast-fed and 21 had been fed formulas. With the feeding of cow milk, the proportion of guaiac-positive stools increased from 3.0% at baseline to 30.3% during the first 28 days of the trial (p less than 0.01), whereas the proportion of positive stools remained low (5.0%) with the feeding of formula. The proportion of guaiac-positive stools among cow milk-fed infants declined later, but for the entire trial it remained significantly (p less than 0.01) elevated. Stool hemoglobin concentration increased markedly with the introduction of cow milk, rising from a mean (+/- SD) of 622 +/- 527 micrograms/gm dry stool at baseline to 3598 +/- 10,479 micrograms/gm dry stool during the first 28 days of ingestion of cow milk. Among infants fed formula, stool hemoglobin did not increase and was significantly (p less than 0.01) less than in the cow milk group. Among infants fed cow milk, the increase in hemoglobin concentration tended to be greater for those who had initially been fed human milk than for those who had initially been fed formulas. Iron nutritional status was not significantly different between the two feeding groups. However, one infant became iron deficient after 4 weeks of ingesting cow milk. We conclude that cow milk feeding leads to increased intestinal tract blood loss in a large proportion of normal infants and that the amount of iron lost is nutritionally important.\r"

Each patient was receiving cortisone acetate, 20.6 to 22.6 mg/m2 body surface area per day, divided into three doses, and 9 alpha-fluorohydrocortisone, 0.05 to 0.1 mg/day. Their spontaneous and adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated blood concentrations of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone were measured initially and were normal. Cortisone acetate was then given once a day in the same total daily dose. After 3 months, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration was increased in all three patients, and in two of them the plasma levels of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were also increased. In the third patient, after 7 months of once-daily therapy, plasma levels of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were increased. We conclude that a physiologic replacement dosage of cortisone acetate given once daily is not effective in controlling excessive adrenal androgen secretion in congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

The subjects all had white parents whose mother tongue was English and were matched for gender, mother's height, mother's education, and father's socioeconomic status (Blishen Scale). A comparison peer group of term infants was also studied. The three preterm groups did not differ in school performance or physical growth, with the exception of head circumference, which was smaller in the SGA children. All preterm groups had growth measures, intellectual and visual-motor integration scores, reading and arithmetic grade levels, and behavior rating levels significantly inferior to those of the peer group. Receptive vocabulary scores and spelling grade levels did not differ between the preterm groups and the peer group. On multivariate analyses, mother's education was the primary predictor of academic grade levels for the preterm SGA group, and the only predictor when the disabled children were excluded from analyses. Preterm SGA children without disabilities had academic scores similar to those of their term peers, but their scores indicated more hyperactivity. Intrauterine growth retardation did not appear to impose a disadvantage on the preterm children in this study.\r"

Two measures of skeletal maturation and predictions of adult height were also compared with population standards. The mean percentiles for the children's height and head circumference were higher than population means. Although mean bone age scores were slightly higher, predictions of adult height did not differ significantly from midparental height (arithmetic mean of sum of parental heights) and population means. The duration of intrauterine hypothyroidism as measured by gestational bone age and the duration of postnatal hypothyroidism were inversely correlated with heights attained up to 9 years. This association suggests a possible long-term influence of early hypothyroidism on growth. In children with congenital hypothyroidism, maintenance of serum thyroxine levels in the upper half of the normal range results in normal growth patterns.\r"

One patient stopped exercise before exhaustion of cardiovascular reserve but had no evidence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities. Four patients terminated exercise because of exhaustion of cardiovascular reserve; one had normal cardiovascular reserve and thallium scintiscans, but the remaining patients had diminished cardiovascular reserve. Thallium scintigrams showed myocardial ischemia in two and infarction in one. No patient had exercise-induced electrocardiographic changes. These results indicate that patients with residual coronary artery lesions after Kawasaki disease frequently have reduced cardiovascular reserve during exercise. The addition of thallium scintigraphy and metabolic measurements to exercise testing improved the detection of exercise-induced abnormalities of myocardial perfusion.\r"

We applied the multiple occlusion technique to measure the static respiratory system compliance, and the end-inspiratory occlusion technique to measure passive respiratory system compliance, resistance, and time constant. When assessed by clinical criteria and pulmonary function measurements, all three patients showed improvement with this treatment. Clinical improvement was associated with an increase in respiratory system compliance as measured by both techniques (60% to 100% increase in all patients). The passive respiratory resistance and the time constant did not closely reflect the clinical course. We conclude (1) that high doses (pulses) of methylprednisolone and daily oral doses of hydroxychloroquine are effective in the treatment of infantile chronic interstitial pneumonitis and (2) that the respiratory system compliance, measured by both pulmonary function techniques, correlates well with the response to treatment and change in clinical status.\r"

Because partial biotinidase deficiency may result in clinical consequences that may be prevented by treatment with biotin, we evaluated such individuals and their family members (1) to determine whether partial biotinidase deficiency is associated with symptoms and (2) to determine the inheritance pattern. We quantified serum biotinidase activity levels and obtained medical histories of probands, their parents and siblings, and additional family members. All children with partial deficiency were healthy at the time of diagnosis. One child, who was not initially treated with biotin, later developed hypotonia, hair loss, and skin rash, which resolved with biotin therapy. Four adults and three children with partial biotinidase deficiency were identified among family members of infants identified by neonatal screening. All these individuals were healthy, although one sibling had elevated urinary lactate excretion. A fifth adult with partial deficiency, found among clinically normal adult volunteers, later showed minor symptoms that resolved after biotin therapy. Like children with profound biotinidase deficiency, children with partial biotinidase deficiency are symptoms free at birth. However, the subsequent occurrence of symptoms of profound biotinidase deficiency in some persons with partial deficiency suggests that biotin therapy for this condition may be warranted.\r"

  ".W": "An infant girl had the clinical and immunologic findings of congenital rubella syndrome but also had arthrogryposis multiplex and calcific epiphyseal stippling. Spastic quadriparesis developed, and both physical and behavioral development were slow. Increased spasticity of the legs at 5 1/2 years was related not to progressive rubella encephalomyelopathy but to spinal cord compression by abnormal cartilaginous tissue. The presence of a peroxisomal disorder was demonstrated by a greatly increased level of phytanic acid and slightly increased levels of hexacosanoate in serum and by reduced activity of peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase and a slightly increased ratio of cytosolic to peroxisomal catalase activity in cultured fibroblasts. A reduction in the number and size of peroxisomes was demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts, and a needle biopsy specimen of the liver also showed the peroxisomes to have a smaller diameter than usual. We recommend that any child with epiphyseal stippling be assessed for peroxisomal disease and that the potential for spinal cord compression by dysplastic bone or cartilage be recognized. The association of peroxisomal dysfunction with congenital rubella has not been described previously. The interaction between rubella virus infection and peroxisomal function may need further investigation.\r"

Debranching enzyme was identified in porcine brain, kidney, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, liver, and spleen; and in human liver, skeletal muscle, lymphocytes, lymphoblastoid cells, skin fibroblasts, cultured chorionic villi, and amniocytes. In each of these tissues the debranching enzyme band was 160 kd. To determine the molecular basis for glycogen storage disease type III at the protein level, tissues from 41 patients with glycogen storage disease type III were also subjected to immunoblot analysis. Three patients having isolated transferase deficiency with retention of glucosidase activity (type IIID disease) had nearly normal amounts of cross-reactive material. In the remaining patients (both transferase and glucosidase deficiency), debranching enzyme was either absent or greatly reduced. These latter patients included 31 with disease that appeared to involve both liver and muscle (type IIIA), four with disease that was present only in the liver (type IIIB), and three with unknown muscle status. In patients with both type IIIA and type IIIB disease, debranching enzyme protein was absent in skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, and lymphocytes. The parents of two patients with type IIIA disease had an intermediate level of debranching enzyme protein, consistent with their presumed heterozygote state. An immunoblot analysis of cultured amniotic fluid cells from a woman whose fetus was at risk for type IIIA disease predicted an unaffected fetus; the prediction was confirmed postnatally. Thus Western blot analysis offers an alternate method of prenatal diagnosis for the most common form of glycogen storage disease type III.\r"

  ".W": "The study objective was to determine the causes and magnitude of absolute CD4 (T4) count variation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected (+) adult males. We conducted a prospective, blinded, and controlled study of 22 adult military male outpatients, including 16 HIV(+) [12 in Walter Reed stage (WR-) 1 through 5, 4 in WR-6 (AIDS)], and 6 HIV seronegative (-) healthy controls. Ten CD4+ cell counts were drawn within a 3-day interval from each patient at the following times: 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2200 h on day 1; and 0800, 1200, and 1600 h on days 2 and 3. A significant CD4+ cell count diurnal increase of 59 cells/mm3 was detected between 0800 h and 2200 h from the WR-1-5 patients (p = 0.018), although this diurnal change was significantly blunted (p = 0.028) as compared with the 506 cells/mm3 CD4+ cell count diurnal increase observed from the HIV(-) healthy controls. The coefficients of variation [CV = (standard deviation/average) x 100] of the three daily 0800 h CD4 cell counts from each patient were 15 (median) and 19 (average) for the WR-1-5 patient group. Blood leukocyte counts, differential fractions of lymphocytes, and total lymphocyte counts contributed more to the observed CD4+ cell count variability than did the CD4% measurements [CV = 7.5 (median), 11 (average)] obtained from flow cytometry. We conclude that the large fluctuations that we observed in repeated CD4+ cell counts in HIV(+) patients can be explained in part by CD4+ cell count diurnal cycle and in part by high variability in total lymphocyte counts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have modeled the risk difference between condom users and nonusers and projected the number of preventable and nonpreventable HIV infections likely to occur among the 419,201 condom users as a function of 50 HIV-incidence/relative risk assumptions. Results of the attributable-risk model suggest that at the current low HIV-incidence level in U.S. women, condom-user failure rates will be less than 1% per year, substantially lower than the 10% condom-user failure rate for pregnancy. As few as 1% but up to 11% of all new HIV cases may be prevented by the current low level of condom use, depending on the exact degree of condom effectiveness in this population at risk. However, the model further projects that up to 45% of all new HIV cases may be prevented if condoms are maximally effective and far more widely used. Women with seropositive partners may enjoy the same protective benefits of condoms, but the costs in terms of condom-user failures will be much higher than in the remainder of the population at risk. Among serious and reliable users, condom-user failure rates for HIV may approach those for pregnancy, but only in women who have known seropositive partners.\r"

Three years later (1986-1987), 41 of the Haitian study subjects and 83 of the non-Haitian controls participated in a follow-up study centered on lymphocyte parameters. A significantly greater number of Haitians than controls had produced antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. In addition, a greater percentage of the Haitians than the controls were also producing antibodies to two other opportunistic pathogens frequently encountered in AIDS, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus, implying that the Haitians in general had had greater exposure to a variety of infectious agents than had the controls. A few study participants were producing antibodies against two viruses that are related to the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), the human T-cell lymphotropic viruses I and II (HTLV-I and -II). Two Haitians and one control were producing antibodies against HTLV-I. One study subject and four controls were HTLV-II seropositive. The most interesting and surprising finding was that four (2.1%) of the Haitian study subjects but none of the controls were seropositive for HIV-1. These individuals, two of whom were women and two men, were asymptomatic. Although their individual lymphocyte parameter values fell in the normal range, as a group they had statistically significantly lower average values for their lymphocyte parameters than did the HIV-seronegative Haitian study objects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The student body is 84% Hispanic and 12% black; Hispanics and blacks account for 70% of AIDS cases among heterosexual adults nationwide and 75% of pediatric cases. We surveyed 1,869 Hostos students to determine their understanding of AIDS risk factors. Respondents' age, English proficiency, time in the college, and time in the United States did not correspond in any consistent way with understanding of risk factors. Sexual intercourse without a condom was recognized as increasing risk by only 69% of all respondents, having a sexual partner who used i.v. drugs 5 years ago by 61%, and having a partner who had a male homosexual relationship 5 years ago by 58%. Only 55% were aware of the risk to the baby if the mother had a partner who used i.v. drugs 5 years earlier. The lack of information observed in college students understates that within the South Bronx as a whole and portends increased heterosexual and pediatric transmission of AIDS. This survey shows that the public health AIDS prevention education program has not yet adequately informed a large segment of the minority population of the South Bronx.\r"

Experience with 335 patients treated with danazol, 800 mg/d, for 25 days before undergoing hysteroscopy with a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser demonstrated that excellent results (amenorrhea or limited spotting) were achieved in 97% of cases. All 46 patients with clotting disorders did well after surgery. The major complications associated with this procedure were fluid overload, profuse bleeding, postoperative urinary tract infections and postoperative hematometra, all of which were controlled successfully. Only one patient had to discontinue danazol treatment because of an adverse reaction.\r"

In addition, we tested the effects of leucovorin on enhancement of fluorinated pyrimidine-induced cytotoxicity. We used a semiautomated tetrazolium dye assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (tetrazolyl blue)] (MTT) to compare the drug sensitivity of the gastric carcinoma cell lines with that of the colorectal carcinoma cell lines. The gastric carcinoma cell lines were more sensitive to some drugs, including doxorubicin and cisplatin, but not to the fluorinated pyrimidines. Addition of leucovorin at a clinically achievable concentration enhanced the cytotoxic effects of both fluorouracil and floxuridine in colorectal carcinoma cell lines, but it enhanced the effects of only floxuridine in gastric carcinoma cell lines. With the use of a slot blot assay, relatively low levels of MDR1 RNA were present in all four gastric carcinoma cell lines, while intermediate or high levels were present in most of the colorectal carcinoma cell lines. In general, our findings reflect clinical experience and may help in the design of clinical trials.\r"

We constructed a library of 25,000 complementary DNA (cDNA) clones enriched for genes associated with metastasis. To build this library, we hybridized messenger RNA (mRNA) from a poorly metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (DMBA8) with cDNA from the highly metastatic variant line (DMBA8 ascites). One-fifth of the library was screened by differential cDNA hybridization. After three rounds of screening, we had isolated 14 cDNA clones that showed higher mRNA expression in the more metastatic cells. When we used Northern blot screening of these cDNA clones against several related rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines and a line that was independently derived, one of the clones showed levels of expression consistently correlating with high metastatic potential. Southern blot analysis indicated that no gene rearrangement or amplification accounted for this change. Partial sequencing of this isolated clone revealed a 45-nucleotide segment homologous to mRNA from human elongation factor 1 subunit alpha, which is involved in protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of the gene corresponding to pGM21 may be important in the development of metastasis.\r"

Interferon doses were escalated in groups of three patients from 6 million to 30 million IUs three times weekly. Disease stages ranged from IB to IVB. Eighty percent of the patients entered in this trial had failed at least one prior therapy. Complete remissions were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses were seen in two of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%. The median duration of response exceeded 13 months (range, 3-15+). All patients who responded have been maintained on therapy. The dose-limiting toxic effects were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%). These side effects were reversible with a decrement in dose or discontinuation of the interferon. No patient tolerated 30 million IU of the interferon for extended periods; the maximally tolerated dose was 18 million IU. Interferon plus PUVA appears to be a highly effective regimen for the treatment of patients with CTCL. Phase II studies investigating this combination, using 18 million IU of interferon alfa-2a three times weekly, should be undertaken to expand these findings, and to attempt to reduce the toxic effects associated with this therapy.\r"

We recently demonstrated that human malignant melanoma cells resistant to the lytic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) become susceptible after treatment with NDV. We examined the effects of a serine protease inhibitor, N-1-tosylamide-2-phenyl-ethyl-chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), on viral enhancement of TNF cytotoxicity. Virulent NDV (but neither heat- nor UV-inactivated NDV) induced a 100-fold increase in the sensitivity of murine fibroblast L929 cells to recombinant human TNF-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha), rHuTNF-beta, and recombinant murine TNF-alpha (rMuTNF-alpha). TPCK, which is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases, blocked between 42% and 93% of the cytolytic activity of rMuTNF-alpha, rHuTNF-alpha, and rHuTNF-beta toward NDV-treated L929 cells. Similarly, TPCK abrogated 62% of the cytotoxicity of rMuTNF-alpha toward dactinomycin-treated L929 cells. In contrast, TPCK had no effect on WEHI 164 clone 13 cells, a murine fibrosarcoma cell line that is much more sensitive to the lytic effects of TNF and does not show enhanced sensitivity to TNF after treatment with either NDV or dactinomycin. These results suggest a role for a cellular protease in the mechanism by which some viruses sensitize tumor cells to the cytolytic activity of TNF.\r"

We identified six male patients with this syndrome treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center: in all six, the leukemia was studied immunohistochemically for various hematologic and germ cell antigens; in four, the karyotype of the leukemia was available; in one, the MGCT had also been karyotyped. In three patients, we found evidence of a germ cell origin of the acute leukemias. A 19-year-old male developed an acute myeloblastic leukemia 11 months after presenting with an MGCT; karyotypes of the two tumors showed them to be clonally related, both showing an i(12p), a cytogenetic marker of germ cell tumors. A 16-year-old male with probable Klinefelter's syndrome presented simultaneously with acute monocytic leukemia and an MGCT; although the MGCT was not karyotyped, the leukemia showed an i(12p). A 23-year-old male developed concurrently an MGCT and acute myelomonocytic leukemia; the leukemia cells coexpressed myelomonocytic antigens (HAM56, My4, My9) and cytokeratin, suggesting dual differentiation, myeloid and germ cell. Evidence for a germ cell origin of the acute leukemias in the three other patients was not obtained, although in all three the MGCT and the leukemia occurred simultaneously, supporting an etiologic relationship. Hence, these leukemias may represent another form of non-germ cell malignancy developing in germ cell tumors. All patients died of the leukemia, with a median survival of less than 2 months. This syndrome may be a useful pathologic model for the study of germ cell differentiation and hematopoietic ontogeny.\r"

Between 1980 and 1988, ten patients were identified who had intestinal injuries and had computed tomographic (CT) scans before operation. For none of these scans was the initial reading considered diagnostic of intestinal injury. All patients came to laparotomy from 2 hours to 3 days following injury, and no patient died because of missed intestinal injury. Retrospective review of the scans revealed two to be diagnostic of intestinal perforation with free intraperitoneal air or extravasated contrast. The remaining eight scans had findings suggestive of injury. However, six additional patients had similar suggestive findings and had no evidence of intestinal injury. One patient with missed duodenal injury had not been given gastrointestinal contrast. Computed tomographic findings of intestinal trauma may be subtle or nonspecific and require optimal technique and care in interpretation. The timely treatment of this injury continues to rely on a high index of clinical suspicion and serial examinations by an experienced surgeon.\r"

Subsequent revision and suturing of the pes anserinus tendon plate was considered to be pertinent in the eventual correction and prevention of recurrence obtained. Although conservative management technics and the possibility of spontaneous correction are also considered in the management of the ailment, the role of the pes anserinus tendon plate is highlighted in terms of loss of its tethering effect and medial overgrowth due to hemichondrodiastasis. Primary repair by removal of the infolding of the periosteum into the fracture space and resuturing of same is the proposed method of management.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant, which is crucial for alveolar stability, may also be involved in endogenous defense mechanisms of the lungs. Thus, alterations in pulmonary surfactant may promote infections, including pneumonia and septicemia. Because patients who have acute respiratory failure often develop pneumonia, thus septicemia, we investigated when surfactant is altered in these patients and whether there is a specific pattern of changes in surfactant phospholipid composition associated with septicemia in these patients. To answer these questions, we determined the phospholipid content and composition in lung washings obtained from alveolar sites (by bronchoalveolar lavage) and from tracheal sites (by aspiration). Both techniques were performed serially over a period of 18 days in 30 patients who had acute respiratory failure resulting from polytrauma, 18 of whom developed septicemia caused by pneumonia. We found that in lung washings obtained from the alveolar sites from all patients, the phosphatidylglycerol content was decreased and the phosphatidylinositol content was increased as early as 6 hr after trauma and normalized during recovery of the patients. In addition, alveolar phosphatidylcholine content was decreased 24 hr after trauma. In patients who developed septicemia during the observation time, but not in patients who had uncomplicated courses of acute respiratory failure, the concentrations of alveolar phosphatidylethanolamine (normally 4.8% of total phospholipids) and alveolar phosphatidylcholine (normally 62.8%) both approached the proportions found in the trachea (phosphatidylethanolamine 33.4%, phosphatidylcholine 35.6%), suggesting that surfactant phospholipid pool size had progressively decreased. Our results indicate that in patients who have acute respiratory failure, pulmonary surfactant is altered very early, and that when septicemia complicates the course of acute respiratory failure, the surfactant phospholipid pool size decreases progressively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of chronic alcohol exposure on immune function in burned patients has not to our knowledge been studied. This study was designed to determine the effect of chronic alcohol exposure before burn injury on immune function after injury in rats. Immune function assessed by in vivo chemotaxis and responsiveness of non-adherent splenocytes to both a T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, and a B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, was measured at 4 days after a 20% BSA full-thickness burn injury and/or gavage of 2.4 gm/kg/day of ethanol for 14 days. Chronic ethanol ingestion before burn injury produced significant suppression in chemotaxis and response to lipopolysaccharide but not in response to concanavalin A. These results suggest that chronic alcohol exposure before injury can contribute to further impaired immune function after injury, and may lead to increased susceptibility to infection and increased mortality.\r"

Average wound breaking strength (WBS) of liver wounds was studied at 3 weeks (54 wounds) and 6 weeks (54 wounds) with a Chatillon tensiometer and microscopic analysis. The WBS of liver wounds was also compared to normal uninjured liver WBS. The porcine WBS at 3 weeks after healing by second intent (0.31 kg/cm2) was similar to the WBS at 3 weeks after healing by hepatorrhaphy (0.30 kg/cm2) and omental buttress (0.25 kg/cm2).

  ".W": "Forty-two consecutive patients with chronic osteomyelitis complicating persistent tibial nonunion and chronic osteomyelitis complicating tibial fracture with segmental bone loss were treated from January 1979 through December 1986 using a protocol including either open cancellous bone grafting (Friedlaender-Papineau technique), posterolateral bone grafting (Harmon technique), or local or microvascular soft-tissue transfer before cancellous bone grafting. Each patient had undergone surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy before inclusion in this study. Patients were classified using a staging system which included consideration of anatomic location of the infection within the bone; extent of bone involvement; quality of soft-tissue envelope and vascular integrity; and generalized host status. The overall success rate for arresting the osteomyelitis and healing the nonunion was 62% (26/42). If the six patients who refused additional bone graft surgery, the one patient who represented poor patient selection, and the patient who refused ankle arthrodesis are eliminated, the success rate for healing of the nonunion and resolving the osteomyelitis in this difficult patient population is: open bone cell graft, 66% (12/18); soft-tissue transfer 87.5%, (7/8); and posterolateral bone grafting, 87.5% (7/8). Use of a standardized classification system allows comparison of treatment results. Adequate debridement is crucial in treating osteomyelitis complicating established long bone fractures and nonunions. Determining the extent of debridement has proven to be the single most difficult aspect technically. Patient selection and pretreatment education are crucial. Caring for these patients is not only labor intensive and demanding of personnel and hospital resources, but demanding of the patients as well.\r"

In the past the retrieval of this information has been incomplete as it has involved the destructive dismantling of a helmet into its component layers. Conventional radiology, whilst being noninvasive, has the disadvantage that all structures traversed by the X-ray beam are superimposed in the final image. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of existing methods, computed tomography (CT) was evaluated in a study of 25 protective helmets. This was found to be an informative, noninvasive technique of investigation that provided faithful images of each helmet layer and delineated helmet damage that was not observed with other methods. Additional advantages of CT include the ease of computed data storage, the ability to reformat CT data into a variety of planes as either two- or three- dimensional images, and the facility to measure distance and density. Limiting factors include scanning cost and artefacts produced by metal in the helmet.\r"

Twelve sheep were given a 15% of total body surface third-degree burn and monitored for 3 or 5 days. Circulating lipid peroxides were monitored by both malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (CD). Lung and liver tissue MDA was also measured and compared to controls. A significant but transient increase in circulating MDA and CD was noted several hours after burn. Venous plasma levels increased again 3-5 days postburn with onset of wound inflammation. Oxygen consumption, VO2, also increased by 35 +/- 12% at this time. Lung MDA, which increased to 64 +/- 5 from a control of 45 +/- 4 nMol/gm, at 12 hours after burn was still increased 3 days after injury. Marked lung inflammation was present early after injury and persisted for the 5-day study period. Liver MDA also increased from control value of 110 +/- 20 to 252 +/- 25 at 12 hours and remained increased over the 5-day period. Serum alkaline phosphatase was also increased. Burn biopsies revealed no infection to explain the ongoing lipid peroxidation process, i.e., bacterial content was less than 10(5) organisms/gram burn tissue. We conclude that an initial system lipid peroxidation occurs immediately after burn injury, and that this process continues well into the post-resuscitation period, corresponding in time with increased VO2, lung inflammation, and evidence of liver dysfunction. The ongoing oxidant changes with the presence of a burn may explain the accentuated organ dysfunction seen with an additional septic insult in burned patients.\r"

  ".W": "Ideal resuscitation would simultaneously replete intravascular volume and minimize cerebral edema. We assessed the effects of hypertonic saline (HS) shock resuscitation on cerebral edema after head injury. Rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock (40 mm Hg for 1 hour) in the presence or absence of mechanical brain injury, followed by 1 hour of resuscitation with either hypertonic saline (6.5%) or lactated Ringer's (LR). After resuscitation, animals were sacrificed and brain water contents determined. Results: Less HS than LR was needed for resuscitation both in animals without brain injury (7 +/- 2 ml/kg vs. 97 +/- 16 ml/kg; p less than 0.0003) and with brain injury (10 +/- 1 ml/kg vs. 68 +/- 6 ml/kg; p less than 0.0001). Brain water content (ml H2O/gm dry wt) after HS resuscitation was decreased compared to LR resuscitation in animals without brain injury (3.36 +/- 0.12 vs. 3.74 +/- 0.08; p less than 0.025) and in the uninjured hemisphere of head-injured animals (3.29 +/- 0.11 vs. 3.78 +/- 0.09; p less than 0.025). Brain water content was increased in injured brain in both resuscitation groups, but the increase was the same (HS 4.10 +/- 0.13; LR 4.25 +/- 0.17; p greater than 0.05). Conclusions: HS resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock decreases brain water content in uninjured but not injured brain. HS may be useful in resuscitation of combined hemorrhagic shock and head injury.\r"

Femoral-femoral bypass with Bio-Pump, heat exchanger, and a membrane oxygenator were used during the rewarming for 64.8 +/- 8.5 minutes. There were no statistically significant changes in platelet count, platelet index, activated clotting time (ACT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, fibrinogen index and fibrin split products (p greater than 0.05). There were no thromboembolic sequelae seen at autopsy. The components of the CPB circuit showed no signs of formation of aggregates or thrombi. The results of this study are attributed to the nonthrombogenic, atraumatic design of the Bio-Pump and the enhanced physiological fibrinolysis seen in the first hour of CPB. We concluded that heparinless CPB may serve as a safe alternative for active core rewarming for severe to moderate hypothermia.\r"

We have applied ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation to modulate the immunogenicity of vein allografts to avoid immunologic injury. The veins of male ACI rats were irradiated with UVB (60 mJ/cm2) in situ and transplanted to male ACI rats (autografts) and female Lewis rats (allografts). Nonirradiated veins served as controls. At 4, 7, 14, and 28 days, all grafts were patent and were studied for morphologic changes by scanning electron microscopy and for immunogold labeling of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression. In autografts, scanning electron microscopy demonstrated minimal endothelial loss after grafting, regardless of UVB irradiation. Untreated allografts showed severe endothelial injury 4, 7, and 14 days after transplantation. UVB irradiation of veins protected allografts from injury to the endothelium and basement membrane. Major histocompatibility complex class II-positive endothelial cells were not seen in autografts but were seen in 40% of cells 4 days after transplantation in untreated allografts. UVB-treated allografts showed MHC class II antigen expression labeling of 20% of the endothelial cells. Barr body analysis demonstrated the donor origin of these endothelial cells. UVB irradiation of rat vein allografts prolongs endothelial survival while decreasing endothelial surface expression of class II antigens. These data suggest that modification of vein immunogenicity with UVB irradiation may permit functional survival of small-vessel allografts without chronic immunosuppression.\r"

Arteriography diagnosed 70% and CT diagnosed 98% of the 45 popliteal disorders. Popliteal aneurysms were not detected by arteriography because of occlusion in seven (20%) patients and intraaneurysmal thrombus that produced no luminal compromise in two. Thrombus was identified by CT in 22 of 24 patient aneurysms and suspected as the source of digital embolization in 7. Graft aneurysms were identified by CT in two cases, but one was not detected by arteriography because of graft occlusion. Two mycotic aneurysms were identified, one by arteriography and not by CT because of misinterpretation of a periarterial hematoma. Popliteal entrapment was diagnosed by CT in three cases, and in two cases occlusion precluded diagnosis of entrapment by arteriography. Adventitial cystic disease was diagnosed accurately by CT in three cases, and in two there were no characteristic arteriographic abnormalities. In cases of entrapment and cystic disease, the CT findings allow the surgeon to plan his approach through a posterior incision, which in these two instances facilitates surgical technique. CT provides detail of the arterial wall, intraarterial contents, and surrounding musculoskeletal anatomy, all of which are useful for accurate evaluation of arterial disorders of the popliteal fossa.\r"

Peak systolic \"stump\" IMA and radial arterial pressures were obtained before and after clamping the right HGA, the left HGA, both HGAs, the middle colic artery (MCA) only, or the MCA plus right HGA, MCA plus left HGA, and MCA plus both HGAs in patients with aortoiliac aneurysm or occlusive disease. Six patients (four with aneurysms and two with occlusive disease) had patent IMAs. Five patients (four with aneurysms and one with occlusive disease) had chronically occluded IMAs. In the six patients with patent IMAs, clamping of the HGAs decreased the IMA-stump pressure index (IMA-SPI) from 0.61 +/- 0.20 to 0.56 +/- 0.17, 0.54 +/- 0.17, and 0.54 +/- 0.19, respectively (p greater than 0.05) whereas clamping only the MCA decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.61 +/- 0.20 to 0.32 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.01). In the five patients with chronically occluded IMAs, clamping of the HGAs decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.60 +/- 0.11 to 0.59 +/- 0.12, 0.58 +/- 0.12, and 0.57 +/- 0.11, respectively (p greater than 0.05), whereas clamping the MCA decreased the IMA-SPI from 0.60 +/- 0.11 to 0.34 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that branches of the superior mesenteric artery provide the major collateral pathway to the IMA bed and that the contribution through branches of the HGAs is insignificant in the acute setting.\r"

By use of seven lenses to focus the ultraviolet light from a nitrogen laser, seven thin blue lines were produced in the photochromic solution flowing through the tube. The displacement profiles of the dye traces were photographed, resulting in the acquisition of the velocity profiles. From these traces, the flow pattern was determined, and the wall shear stresses were measured. Turbulence was generated 3.3 to 6.5 tube diameters downstream from the edge of the stenosis, depending on the time in the pulsatile flow cycle. Maximum wall shear stress fluctuations between positive and negative values appeared to lie within 1.6 to 3.3 tube diameters downstream of the stenosis. In several illustrative clinical cases of thoracic outlet arterial compression, the poststenotic dilation was maximum at 2.0 +/- 0.3 vessel diameters downstream. Based on these observations, it is postulated that wall shear stress fluctuations may be important in the development of poststenotic dilation.\r"

However, the utility of this approach in other sites remains undetermined. The potential of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in the treatment of a broad spectrum of lower extremity atherosclerosis was explored. Seventy-seven limbs in 69 patients were treated with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty by means of a percutaneous approach. Technical success was achieved in 62/77 (81%), with 52/77 (68%) open at discharge. At a mean of 8.6 months' follow-up, cumulative patency was 50% at 6 months and 42% at 9 months. In 10 cases initial guide wire placement was not possible; primary laser probe passage was technically successful in six, with two open at latest follow-up. Eleven patients underwent laser therapy without balloon angioplasty of distal sites with technical success in eight; at most recent follow-up five were open at the site of sole laser therapy. Complications were frequent. Bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in six, with three patients requiring emergency surgery; worsened ischemia necessitating urgent arterial bypass grafting developed in five patients. In this series laser angioplasty carried significant complications and a high failure rate. Widespread application of this procedure should await further clinical investigation.\r"

Among 163 subcutaneous autogenous bypass grafts, wound complications developed in 28 (17%). According to progressive depth of involvement as defined in the text, 10 patients had grade I complications, six had grade II, and 12 had grade III complications with threatened or actual graft exposure. Factors significantly associated with wound morbidity were female gender, chronic steroid therapy, in situ bypass grafting, use of continuous incision (all p less than or equal to 0.05, chi square); diabetes mellitus, ipsilateral limb ulcer, limb salvage indication (all p less than 0.01); and bypass grafting to the dorsalis pedis artery (p less than 0.02). A logistic regression analysis identified four factors (in situ bypass grafting, steroid therapy, ipsilateral ulcer, and dorsalis pedis bypass grafting) that predicted a cumulatively increasing risk of wound complications, and in whose absence wound complications were rare. Grade I and II complications responded to standard regimens of wound care and intravenous antibiotics without loss of any graft or limb. In spite of aggressive efforts to provide secondary soft tissue coverage, grade III complications led directly to four major amputations and one death. Measures to prevent these morbid sequelae must include preoperative control of infection in the ischemic foot and meticulous attention to operative technique.\r"

Patients were elderly with an average age of 68 years (median 72); most had several operative risk factors. Reversed saphenous vein grafts were used early, but most conduits were in situ vein grafts. The recipient vessel was the dorsalis pedis artery in 39 patients, the posterior tibial in 27, and tarsal branches in two. Preoperative angiography was routinely performed with biplanar and digital arterial techniques, but in nearly a third a suitable bypass vessel was not identified preoperatively. When vessels were identified there was usually only a single patent artery suitable for bypass grafting below the knee. There were five postoperative deaths (7.6%). Eight grafts (11%) required early revision for thrombosis or retained valve, and six were salvaged and remained patent. Poor vein quality appeared responsible for the two early failures. Six late graft occlusions occurred from 4 to 39 months (mean 14 months). Three of these patients had no recurrence of their ulceration, but two required amputation, and one has continued rest pain. One additional amputation was required in a patient with a patent graft. Eleven late deaths (16%) occurred (nine with patent grafts) primarily of cardiac causes.\r"

  ".W": "The results of the use of prosthetic materials for femorocrural bypass surgery have been less than optimal. The creation of a distal anastomotic arteriovenous fistula to augment blood flow and velocity through the graft is well known. However, it may create turbulence at the anastomosis and steal blood flow away from the distal artery. A canine model was developed to evaluate the effect of fistula size on graft/arterial hemodynamics. In 16 patients we have constructed a distal arteriovenous fistula, which is remote from the distal anastomosis, and we studied the effect of such fistulas on bypass patency and distal arterial hemodynamics. Patients selected for this procedure had multiple previously failed reconstructions and limb-threatening ischemia and did not have usable autogenous vein. Femorotibial bypass graft reconstructions were performed with polytetrafluoroethylene followed by the creation of a side-to-side arteriovenous fistula 5 to 15 cm below the distal anastomosis in the same artery and accompanying veins. We have achieved a 1-year patency of 67% with a 75% limb salvage rate. We also serially measured blood flow and velocity within the bypass, the arteriovenous fistula, and the distal outflow vessel using duplex scanning after surgery. Mean estimated blood flow through the bypass during the immediate postoperative period was 264 ml/min, the arteriovenous fistula was 157 ml/min, and the distal artery was 19 ml/min. Unlike an arteriovenous fistula created at the distal anastomosis, a remote distal arteriovenous fistula not only increases graft blood flow but also augments native arterial blood flow between the distal anastomosis and fistula and thus may improve distal limb perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 2 decades 102 consecutive patients (77 men and 25 women) with multiple aortic aneurysms underwent 201 aortic reconstructions. These procedures (174 elective and 27 emergent) represented 3.4% of the 5837 aortic aneurysm operations performed. Seventy-five (30.9%) of the 243 aneurysms occurred in the infrarenal aorta, 65 occurred in the descending aorta (26.7%), 56 occurred in the thoracoabdominal aorta (23.0%), and 47 occurred in the ascending aorta or arch (19.3%). Ages ranged from 20 to 81 years (mean 63.3 years). Smoking history and abnormal electrocardiographic tracings were present in 84.3% of the patients, hypertension was present in 77.5%, and obstructive lung disease was present in 60.8%. Multiple aortic aneurysms were present at the time of the first repair in 55 patients (53.9%). Twelve patients had one procedure, 81 had two, and nine had three. Sixteen (17.8%) of the 90 patients who had multiple operations had a subsequent operation for complications of the unrepaired aneurysm (rupture 12, symptoms 4). Fourteen perioperative deaths occurred among the 174 elective repairs (8.0%), and 11 occurred among the 27 emergent procedures (40.7%). Procedure mortality increased with the ordinal number of elective operations and was 4.4% for the first, 10.4% for the second, and 33.3% for the third. Seven of 21 patients (33.3%) who had simultaneous repair of at least two aortic aneurysms died in the perioperative period. Overall, 77 of the 102 patients (75.5%) survived all surgical procedures to repair their multiple aortic aneurysms; of these, 63 had complete resection of all known aneurysms. Follow-up was complete in all patients and averaged 6.3 years (ranges: 1 month to 19 years). There were 30 late deaths; the most frequent cause was myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival including perioperative deaths for all patients after the first operation was 76% and after the last operation 40%. We conclude that multiple aortic aneurysms can be safely managed, usually with staged repairs, and that long-term survival is probably. After the first aortic operation the presence of multiple aneurysms mandates close observation with timely surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "A 33-year experience with 58 ureteral complications in 50 of 3580 patients undergoing aortoiliac reconstruction was analyzed. Ureteral obstruction was treated before or in conjunction with aneurysm repair in six patients with aneurysmal disease. The remaining 44 patients had 46 ureteral complications after aortic reconstruction; complications included hydronephrosis (42), ureteral leak (3), and ureteral necrosis (1). A high incidence of associated graft complications was noted. Graft thrombosis developed in one of the six patients undergoing prior or simultaneous ureteral procedures, and graft infection developed in another. Thirty-six graft complications developed in 24 (55%) of the 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications. The complications included 19 anastomotic aneurysms, eight graft limb thromboses, six graft infections, and three aortoenteric fistulas. Twenty-nine of the 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications underwent ureteral or graft operations or both. These included five patients having ureteral operations alone, seven with a ureteral procedure and subsequent graft operation, eight requiring simultaneous ureteral and graft procedures, and nine undergoing a graft operation with ureteral observation. Six of these 29 patients (21%) died after operation, all from graft complications including aortoenteric fistulas (three), ruptured anastomotic aneurysms (two), and graft infection (one). Graft complications affected 55% of 44 patients with postoperative ureteral complications, compared to 12% of 3536 patients without ureteral complications (p less than 0.0001). Patients with postoperative ureteral complications were 4.4 times as likely to have graft complications compared to those without ureteral complications (p less than 0.0001). These data suggest that such urologic complications may be markers for recognition of or harbingers for graft complications.\r"

One hundred fourteen patients with skull base tumors or intracranial aneurysms potentially requiring carotid resection or ligation underwent angiography, xenon CT cerebral blood flow mapping, and internal carotid artery blood pressure monitoring. The internal carotid artery was then temporarily occluded with a balloon catheter, stump pressure was measured through the catheter, and the xenon CT cerebral blood flow mapping was repeated. Adequate xenon CT cerebral blood flow was defined as greater than 30 cc/100 gm/min. All patients had normal xenon CT cerebral blood flow before internal carotid artery occlusion. During internal carotid artery occlusion, xenon CT cerebral blood flow was found to be normal (group I, 40 patients), globally reduced but still within the normal range (group II, 50 patients), or low in the distribution of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (group III, 13 patients). With balloon occlusion, an immediate neurologic deficit developed in 11 patients (9%) requiring deflation of the balloon preceding xenon CT cerebral blood flow measurement (group IV). In group I internal carotid artery blood pressure was 128 mm Hg. (range 85 to 171 mm Hg) with stump pressure 86 mm Hg (range 46 to 125 mm Hg). In group II internal carotid artery blood pressure was 130 mm Hg. (range 78 to 199 mm Hg), with stump pressure 86 mm Hg (range 31 to 150 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An arbitrary delay of at least 6 weeks before performing carotid endarterectomy after acute stroke has been recommended based on anecdotal reports. This prolonged interval may increase the danger of recurrent neurologic deficit before surgery. From September 1978 to September 1988, carotid endarterectomy was performed on 140 patients at variable intervals after stroke. Eleven patients had temporary stroke, which left 129 patients with neurologic symptoms that persisted for 3 weeks or had a cortical infarct on CT scanning. A prospective therapeutic protocol was applied to 82 patients admitted with acute stroke. They were observed until neurologic recovery reached a plateau, based on clinical observation by a neurologist, before performing angiography and carotid endarterectomy (group I). Forty-seven patients were not seen until after recovery from stroke was established (group II). At initial presentation, the severity of neurologic deficit was classified as mild, moderate, or severe in 31%, 58%, and 11%, respectively. Recovery before operation was registered as complete in 11%, mild residual in 66%, moderate residual in 21%, and severe residual in 2%. Group I patients (n = 82, 64%) were operated on within 6 weeks of stroke and group II (n = 47, 36%) were operated on at varying times after 6 weeks. No significant difference was found in the incidence of cerebrovascular events (1.2% vs 4.2%) and deaths (1.3% vs 2.1%) between groups I and II with respect to the timing of carotid endarterectomy, and no significant difference was found between patients operated on at 2, 4, 6, or more than 6 weeks after stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty operations were performed, including 28 lower extremity revascularizations, 10 major amputations and revisions, and two carotid endarterectomies. There were four postoperative deaths (three cardiac related) and two nonfatal reinfarctions. Cardiac complications did not correlate with age, interval from myocardial infarction to surgery within the initial 6 weeks, type of anesthesia, or complexity of operation. Twenty of 24 patients survived attempts at leg revascularization, with ultimate limb salvage in 16. Our cardiac complication rate of 17% (5/30 patients) was reasonably close to that predicted by the Goldman risk scale for classes II and III and significantly better than class IV and also better than that predicted by the Cooperman risk scale for vascular surgery, despite the more recent preoperative myocardial infarctions in our patients. We attribute our low morbidity and mortality to the extracavitary nature of the procedures and possibly to improvements in anesthetic and perioperative management. Patients requiring urgent revascularization for limb salvage should not be denied surgery on the basis of a recent myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Current management of penetrating injuries in the proximity of major extremity arteries with no evidence of vascular trauma remains controversial. A total of 318 such injuries in 254 patients were evaluated prospectively to clarify the appropriate timing and role of arteriography, as well as the natural history of these injuries. The arteries at risk were: axillary, 47; brachial, 57; superficial femoral, 176; and popliteal, 38. No deaths occurred, and no morbidity resulted from arteriographic delay of 6 to 24 hours after injury. Of the 48 arteriographic abnormalities detected, 16 involved noncritical branch vessels. There were 32 injuries to major arteries (10.0%), including localized narrowing (n = 13), intimal flap (n = 12), false aneurysm (n = 6), and arteriovenous fistula (n = 1). Shotgun wounds led to a greater arterial injury rate (3/17; 17.6%) than did gunshot wounds (24/247; 9.7%) or stab wounds (5/54; 9.3%). At the surgeon's discretion, three injuries underwent immediate exploration (one negative), whereas the remaining 29 vessel injuries were followed up nonoperatively by repeat arteriography (n = 22) or clinical examination (n = 7), for a mean interval of 2.8 months. Fifteen abnormalities resolved, 10 improved or remained unchanged, and 4 worsened. The four lesions (13.7%) that worsened (two shotgun and two axillary artery injuries) were identified within 3 months of injury and repaired surgically with no morbidity. In conclusion, only 6 operations were required out of 3218 potential injuries (1.8%), suggesting that routine arteriography is not a cost-effective means of evaluating these injuries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Morphometric analysis of saphenous vein endothelium revealed no significant loss of endothelial integrity as a result of cryopreservation. Endothelial cell culture revealed similar numbers of clonogenic intimal cells from cryopreserved and fresh saphenous, cephalic, and jugular veins. Smooth muscle function was assessed by measurement of the isometric force generated by vein rings in response to norepinephrine, serotonin, and potassium chloride. There was no significant difference in the dose responses of cryopreserved and fresh saphenous veins to the reagents tested. Similar results were obtained for the cephalic and jugular vein experiments with norepinephrine. The maximum tensions generated in response to norepinephrine were 52% of fresh control segments. Connective tissue function was assessed by quantitation of 3H-proline incorporation. The results indicate that cryopreserved veins retained approximately 43.5% of values of fresh vein collagen synthesis. Finally, eight cryopreserved cephalic vein autografts were placed as femoral artery grafts and were removed electively after 1 to 8 weeks. All grafts were patent. Both light and electron microscopy demonstrated that the cryopreserved veins remained intact in vivo and that arteriolization occurred as described for fresh autografts in the literature. In conclusion, cryopreserved veins retain much of their cellular and tissue functions on thawing. Transplantation of cryopreserved veins suggests that cryopreservation does not change the sequence of histologic events associated with the use of autologous fresh vein as an arterial substitute.\r"

Six strategies have been adopted or proposed to reduce cesarean section use: (1) education and peer evaluation, (2) external review, (3) public dissemination of cesarean section rates, (4) changes in physician payment, (5) changes in hospital payment, and (6) medical malpractice reform. These strategies differ in their specific assumptions regarding the process of clinical decision making, implications for physician autonomy, and methods of implementation. Educational efforts have been the most widely promoted. Of these, formal programs aimed at modifying practices within individual hospitals appear to be the most successful. However, insufficient research has been conducted to compare conclusively the impact and feasibility of these six strategies, pointing to the need for further study.\r"

Increased consumption of butter was associated with significantly higher blood pressure and serum cholesterol and glucose levels for men; in women only the association with glucose reached statistical significance. In both sexes consumption of olive oil and vegetable oil was inversely associated with serum cholesterol and glucose levels and systolic blood pressure. These findings were adjusted for confounding effects of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These cross-sectional findings from a large population sample suggest that consumption of butter may detrimentally affect coronary risk factors, while polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may be associated with a lower coronary risk profile.\r"

At enrollment, 783 (63%) of 1250 employees had antibody to CMV. By logistic regression analysis, age greater than 30 years, black race, fewer than 16 years of education, employment for more than 1 year, female sex, and being married were each associated with seropositivity at enrollment. Three hundred workers who were seronegative initially were followed up; 13 seroconverted over a median follow-up interval of 1.96 years, 2.2% per year. Administrative, patient-care, laboratory, and support personnel were included among seroconverters. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of CMV infection when employees were grouped by job type, number of hours per week of patient contact, or nursing unit. The incidence of CMV among employees of a children's hospital was similar to the rate expected for the general population. Risk of CMV infection was not increased by patient contact in this setting.\r"

Thus, approximately 31% of the excess mortality can be accounted for by six well-established risk factors and a further 38% by family income. This leaves 31% unexplained. Broader social and health system changes and research targeted at the causes of the mortality gap, coupled with increased efforts aimed at modifiable risk factors, may all be needed for egalitarian goals in health to be realized.\r"

  ".W": "Crack cocaine is a smokable form of cocaine hydrochloride that has been associated with increases in admissions to drug treatment programs, and, recently, increases in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among black teenagers. In an exploratory, cross-sectional study of the prevalence of risk behaviors that would promote the dissemination of STDs (including human immunodeficiency virus) among 222 black teenaged crack users, 41% of those interviewed reported a history of an STD. A history of an STD was more likely to be reported by girls (55%) than by boys (34%) and by those who combined crack use with sexual relations (51%) than those who did not (32%). The number of risk behaviors for STDs or human immunodeficiency virus reported by respondents (including failure to use a condom in one's most recent sexual encounter, having had a history of an STD, engaging in exchanges of sex for drugs or money, combining sexual activity with drug use, and reporting five or more sexual partners per year) was evaluated using multiple regression analysis stratified by gender. For girls, a history of selling crack and the number of reported risk behaviors (R = .46); for boys who chose the description \"I don't know ahead of time if I'm going to have sex--it just happens\" and the number of drugs used on a daily basis were associated with the number of reported risk behaviors (R = .31). Because of the impetuous nature of some crack-related sexual activity and because 76% of respondents acknowledged that they were either \"very worried\" or \"somewhat worried\" that they might get acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it is possible that a program of widespread distribution of condoms in neighborhoods where crack use is prevalent might make it possible for the worried, impulsive crack user to practice \"safer sex.\"\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown an elemental diet to be as effective as bowel rest plus steroids in the management of acute Crohn's disease. In order to investigate the metabolic and immunological effects of these two therapies, six patients with an acute inflammatory attack of ileal Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive steroids or elemental diet for 7 days. Immunological and protein metabolic studies were performed before and after therapy, protein kinetic rates being measured by the method of constant intravenous infusion of 14C-labeled leucine tracer. Clinical and symptomatic improvement was noted in all six patients with significant falls in sedimentation rate and platelet counts and increases in albumin concentrations. Both forms of treatment increased plasma amino acid flux and oxidation rates, whole body protein turnover and rates of incorporation of amino acid into albumin. However, the increased rates of protein metabolism in the patients given steroids were at the expense of body protein stores with a net (average) loss of 58 g of nitrogen over 7 days. While both forms of therapy were associated with suppression of lymphocyte subsets, complement and circulating immune complexes only the steroid regimen was associated with suppression of in vivo IgG synthesis rates. The results indicated that both forms of therapy were associated with clinical improvement, increases in protein turnover and evidence of reduced inflammatory activity. However, the beneficial effects of steroid regimen must be balanced against the deleterious effects on body protein stores; steroids and bowel rest without nutritional support should be avoided in malnourished patients.\r"

  ".W": "The fatty acids profiles of plasma and red blood cell lipids have been evaluated in 12 malnourished cancer patients in comparison with samples from eight healthy controls. In such patients, significantly lower levels of linoleic acid (LA) as percentage of total fatty acids were observed in plasma phospholipids (PL) and cholesterol esters (CE), and in red blood cells PL. The levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and the unsaturation index of the two lipid classes were also reduced in plasma CE but not in PL. In spite of the marked reduction of LA and, more generally, of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), no elevation of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 n-9) was observed, such acid being considered a typical index of essential fatty deficiency. Moreover, no modification of the parameters indicating impairment of the fatty acid desaturation activity was shown. In addition, the levels of palmitic and oleic acids were significantly higher in both plasma PL and CE and in red blood cells PL. The reported elevation of the oleic to stearic acid ratio in lipids of red blood cells from malnourished cancer patients, already observed by other authors, was confirmed in our study. This ratio was even more markedly elevated in plasma lipids of the patients. A very good correlation was found between the reduction of linoleic acid levels, especially in plasma CE, and weight loss, suggesting enhanced utilization of this fatty acid in association with extensive depletion of lipid stores, in this pathological state.\r"

Detailed feeding histories of the 39 cases occurring between January 1, 1984 and May 31, 1985 were compared with matched controls. The study period included a cluster (epidemic) of 11 cases diagnosed within 1 month. Data were analyzed collectively and separately for endemic and epidemic cases. Collectively, cases had greater average daily intake volume, maximum daily intake volume, intake volume on the day prior to diagnosis, and maximum daily caloric intake (all p less than 0.05) than controls. The only recorded parameter that differed in endemic cases vs controls was intake the day prior to diagnosis. In contrast, epidemic cases were fed significantly more volume, more calories, and faster than controls: average intake volume (62.5 +/- 27.2 vs 37.4 +/- 18.0 ml/kg/day); maximum intake volume (118.5 +/- 33.5 vs 76.4 +/- 38.8 ml/kg/day); intake day prior to diagnosis (109.8 +/- 30.9 vs 63.8 +/- 43.1 ml/kg/day); maximum daily increment (42.6 +/- 16.7 vs 26.7 +/- 16.4 ml/kg); maximum caloric intake (126.1 +/- 44.6 vs 77.3 +/- 50.0) (all p less than 0.01). Five of the feeding parameters were significantly less for the epidemic controls than the endemic controls, suggesting a general slowing of feeding during the NEC epidemic. In summary, the data suggest feeding patterns may have an impact on NEC especially during epidemic periods.\r"

Of tumors in the premenopausal and postmenopausal state, 62% and 57%, respectively, were positive for nuclear ER, with a cutoff value of 10 fmoles/100 micrograms DNA. This study suggested that evaluation of functional ER level would reduce the number of false-negative and false-positive tumors.\r"

This study presents an examination of a program of autologous blood deposit for cancer patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. Over a 3-year period, 235 patients deposited 388 units of autologous blood: 6 for head and neck tumor surgery, 8 for neurosurgical tumors, 8 for gastrointestinal and colorectal tumor surgery, 14 for adrenal tumor surgery, 16 for gynecologic tumor surgery, 23 for soft tissue and bone tumor surgery, 25 for mastectomies and reconstructive breast surgery, 42 for genitourinary tumor surgery, and 93 for bone marrow aspirations for autologous transplants. One hundred eighty-two patients (77.4%) used 278 units (71.6%) of their autologous blood units during the operations, 50/182 required additional homologous blood, and 53 did not require transfusions with autologous blood. Our study shows that a majority of these patients (132/182) underwent surgery using only autologous transfusions. Therefore, we believe that predeposited autologous blood is a viable alternative to homologous blood for cancer patients undergoing surgery.\r"

The operative procedure consisted of a transhiatal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up to establish gastrointestinal continuity, with a unilateral or bilateral neck dissection where indicated. Seven patients died, a mortality rate of 9.33%. The average hospital stay of uncomplicated cases was 18 days and for complicated cases was 40 days. Immediate restoration of oral intake was achieved in 70.6% of patients. We conclude that gastric transposition after circumferential laryngopharyngeal excision is a procedure with low mortality and acceptable morbidity leading to early relief of dysphagia.\r"

Six of 19 patients with endocrine tumors other than MTC showed elevated CGRP levels. Immunohistochemical study showed that tumor tissues from all 22 cases of MTC and seven from other endocrine tumors contained immunoreactive CGRP. CGRP reactivity was found in only small numbers of tumor cells. Thus, although CGRP appeared to be a useful additional marker for MTC, the role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of endocrine tumors was not elucidated.\r"

The BrdU labeling indicates (BrdU LI) varied from 2.1 to 45%. When the in vitro BrdU LI were plotted against in vivo BrdU LI, a significant correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo BrdU LI (P less than .01). These results show that the in vitro BrdU LI of specimens obtained by endoscopic biopsy indicate accurate proliferative activities of gastric cancers. The BrdU LI were closely correlated with nodal status, vessel invasion, and tumor size. With regard to the correlation of BrdU LI and prognosis, patients whose tumors had a high BrdU LI (BrdU greater than LI less than 10%). When the BrdU LI and all the pathologic findings were entered simultaneously into the regression model, nodal status, tumor size, serosal involvement, and BrdU LI emerged as independent prognostic parameters. The present studies demonstrated the usefulness of the in vitro BrdU-labeling method to estimate the malignancy of gastric cancer preoperatively, and this method may be useful in designing the operative procedure and multimodal therapy for individual patients.\r"

The incidence of inaccurate staging was 25% for clinical stage I and 62.5% for clinical stage II disease. Endocervical curettage was found to have a 12.5% false-positive rate and an 8.6% false-negative rate. The extent of malignant disease for endometrium cancer (clinical stages I-II) cannot be adequately and accurately assessed with clinical staging because there is a high rate of discordance between clinical and surgical-pathologic staging.\r"

Minor anastomotic leakage occurred in five patients (9.4%). Good results were obtained with total parenteral nutrition for 2 weeks. Intrathoracic anastomotic complications were never fatal. Among another 106 patients with antesternally reconstructed esophagus, with the EEA stapler there were 28 patients with anastomotic leakage (26.4%) and two operative mortalities (1.9%). Intrathoracic anastomosis with the EEA stapler is recommended because it is secure and the operative procedure is simple and time-saving.

Lymph nodes were cut in serial sections 300 microns thick, and the volume of tumour metastasis in each resected lymph node was computed measuring the tumourous area in the lymph node sections. The following results were obtained: Percentage of resected lymph nodes varied with lymph node site and site of the primary lung cancer. Hilar lymph nodes were resected in 50% of the patients, lymph nodes of the main and stem bronchi in 57% and 63%, respectively. Tumour metastases were found in 10%-15% of the resected lymph nodes. The size of the lymph nodes varied to a large amount and was found to be independent of the lymph node site if no metastases could be detected. Lymph nodes measuring less than 0.1 ccm were tumour infiltrated in 9% (77/706 lymph nodes), large lymph nodes (greater than 10 ccm) in 62% of the cases (20/32). Tumourous involved lymph nodes of the main bronchus were found more frequently in cases of central localized lung cancer compared to carcinoma arising from the peripheral lung, where the opposite was seen in subaortal located lymph nodes. The percentage of lymph node involvement and size of tumour infiltrated lymph nodes was found to be independent of tumour cell type. Size of resected lymph nodes is not a reliable parameter for estimating existence of tumour infiltrations.\r"

The study group included 36 (62%) men and 22 (38%) women with an age range of 42-96 years. Forty-three patients had invasive pedunculated polyps and 15 had invasive sessile polyps. Following the colonoscopic polypectomy, secondary surgical resection was done in 19 patients with pedunculated polyps and in 13 patients with sessile polyps. The operative specimens showed that the colonoscopic polypectomy removed the entire cancerous focus in all patients with pedunculated polyps, including those with stalk invasion. In contrast, most cases with sessile polyps turned out on operation to be Dukes' B or C carcinoma. Follow-up (mean 4.4 years) was available for 53 (93%) patients: none of 24 unoperated patients with pedunculated polyps suffered from local recurrence. We conclude that colonoscopic polypectomy is sufficient for invasive pedunculated polyps, provided that histology shows that the resection margins are free of tumoral cells. Surgery is recommended for all invasive sessile polyps.\r"

We present two cases of laparotomy-proven unresectable cystadenocarcinoma which responded to intravenous 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2/24 hr x 5 days x 2) and 4,000 rads of radiation therapy. Both patients had objective response with marked shrinkage of the tumor as determined by clinical examination and computed tomography. At reexploration both tumors had become completely resectable with histologically clear margins and negative lymph nodes. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were elevated in both patients at initial presentation (86 and 71 ng/ml). The CEA levels declined to 19.9 and 66.0 ng/ml, respectively, after neo-adjuvant therapy, and both fell to normal levels after resection. Although surgical resection has been considered the only curative therapy for patients with pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma, we suggest that preoperative irradiation and chemotherapy may reduce the size of seemingly unresectable tumors. We also recommend serial CEA determinations in patients with levels initially elevated as a marker of the response to neo-adjuvant and operative therapy.\r"

Men outnumbered women 3.6 to 1, and the sex ratio of age-adjusted incidence rates was 4.5:1. The incidence rates increased after middle age for men but not for women. The most common suicide methods were gunshot wounds for men and poisoning for women. Two-thirds of the suicides occurred at home and were usually discovered by family members or friends.

Patients with cryptogenic disease could not be distinguished from those with autoimmune disease on the basis of age, sex distribution, duration of illness, immunoglobulin levels, frequency of concurrent immunologic disorders, or histologic findings. Serum gamma-globulin levels were higher (3.4 +/- 0.1 versus 2.5 +/- 0.2 g/dl, P = 0.007) and albumin levels were lower (2.9 +/- 0.1 versus 3.3 +/- 0.1 g/dl, P = 0.003) in patients with autoimmune disease than in those with cryptogenic disease, but individual findings did not differentiate the patients. Remission (69 versus 75%), treatment failure (23 versus 13%), relapse after drug withdrawal (67 versus 68%), progression to cirrhosis (57 versus 36%), and death from hepatic failure (12 versus 11%) occurred as commonly in patients with cryptogenic as in those with autoimmune disease. Patients with different constellations of immunoserologic findings were similar clinically. We conclude that patients with severe chronic active hepatitis who have been fully screened for etiologic factors cannot be distinguished from patients with autoimmune disease of comparable severity. These two groups of patients have a similar prognosis after corticosteroid therapy, and such treatment should be considered in these highly selected patients.\r"

Patients completed the Emotional Responses of Athletes to Injury Questionnaire and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) test, and significant differences were found when the POMS scales of depression and anger were compared with college norms. Mean POMS scores were compared (by multivariate analysis of variance) by sex, age, and severity of injury. No gender differences were found, and only for anger were age groups significantly different (younger athletes were most angered). Three severity-of-injury groups (based on the duration of time the athlete was unable to participate in sports) were also compared. The most seriously injured group experienced significantly more tension, depression, and anger and less vigor than college norms, a mood disturbance that lasted 1 month. Emotional disturbance can occur after a sports-related injury, and its prompt recognition may facilitate the athlete's optimal rehabilitation and a safe return to participation in sports.\r"

  ".W": "Severe hepatic venous outflow obstruction and its manifestations often are recorded under the label \"Budd-Chiari syndrome.\" Unfortunately, this label is ambiguous; it does not clearly identify the site of the lesion (hepatic veins versus inferior vena cava), its morphologic features (thrombotic versus nonthrombotic), or its cause. In the literature, implied or expressed definitions vary. Use of a standardized topographic and pathogenetic classification of hepatic venous outflow obstruction would enable investigators to group patients with comparable conditions, as required for therapeutic trials, prognostic evaluations, and studies of pathogenetic pathways. Review of our own cases revealed that hepatic venous outflow obstruction involving large hepatic veins is usually thrombotic and that isolated obstruction of the inferior vena cava or of small hepatic veins is usually nonthrombotic. Application of such a classification seems feasible and may yield useful results.\r"

Because of the large numbers of patients in whom hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the United States and other industrialized nations, an approach was devised in which, with physician supervision, specially trained nurses managed many aspects of the acute and long-term outpatient care of hypertensive patients. Clinical trials in which nonphysician care-providers were used to treat hypertensive patients and to maintain long-term blood pressure control provided an opportunity to identify and to expand the concept of continuing care for blood pressure management in a community hypertension clinic. Currently, almost 7,000 patient visits are scheduled annually in this program, and these patients are seen by five full-time hypertension nurse-therapists.\r"

The hypothesis that this toxic effect might have resulted from abnormal metabolism of cyclosporin by liver cytochrome P-450 IIIA was investigated with the [14C]erythromycin breath test, which is a measure of this enzyme's activity. P-450 IIIA activity was decreased compared with that in controls, including other liver transplant recipients. Pretreatment with rifampicin, an inducer of P-450 IIIA, increased enzyme activity. After treatment with rifampicin the patient could be rechallenged with cyclosporin at a dose almost twice that which had previously been toxic. The patient died during a second transplantation and the microsomal content of P-450 IIIA was found to be low in the first transplant.\r"

Ovarian activity was monitored by assays for hormone metabolites in daily urine samples. On average, women in Baltimore breastfed less often but for longer at each feed than women in Manila, and the mean times until ovulation were 27 and 38 weeks post partum. 41% of first ovulations had luteal phase defects. Anovular first menses were common (45.1%) during the first 6 months post partum but the rate fell greatly thereafter. The risk of ovulation was reduced by a higher frequency of breastfeeds, longer duration of each feed, and less supplementary feeding. During the first 6 months post partum, amenorrhoeic women had low risks of ovulation (below 10%) with partial breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding reduced the risk to 1-5% with either frequent short feeds or infrequent longer feeds. However, if the woman started menstruating before 6 months post partum, or if she continued breastfeeding beyond 6 months, the risk of ovulation rose, and contraception would be needed.\r"

Sensitivity and specificity for TAP assay were 80% and 90%, for C-reactive protein 53% and 55%, and for multifactorial scoring at 48 h, 60% and 93%. Urine TAP assay distinguishes acute pancreatitis without trypsinogen activation from acute pancreatitis with trypsinogen activation, and helps to identify patients who will progress to the severe acute disease. Use of the assay should allow early intensive treatment of those who need it.\r"
