  ".W": "The measurement of gas exchange for use in indirect calorimetry is a clinical research tool struggling to find its proper place in the care of acutely ill and nutritionally depleted patients. Some investigators have proposed that it should be used as part of the nutritional assessment. Unfortunately, in common with many other measurements for nutritional assessment, the information provided must be integrated with other information. It is recognized that factors other than malnutrition may influence the level of the metabolic rate. Despite the lack of precision and specificity, the measurement of energy expenditure provides an important reference for determining patients' requirements for energy intake. As with many other procedures in clinical medicine, the more severely ill the patient, the less the accuracy of standard formulas for estimating energy expenditure. Thus, actual measurements of energy expenditure assume special value.\r"

  ".U": "88036448\r", 
  ".W": "Protein synthesis and degradation are particularly sensitive to malnutrition and catabolic states. Intracellular protein degradation is determined by the conformation, molecular weight, isoelectric point, and carbohydrate content of the proteins. ATP-stimulated endoproteases appear to catalyse the rate-limiting steps. In the liver, proteolysis is reduced by amino acids and/or insulin, whereas glucagon stimulates protein degradation, probably due to depletion of intracellular gluconeogenic amino acids. In the muscle, protein degradation is promoted by interleukin-1 and inhibited by Ep-475, which specifically inactivates cathepsin B,H, and L. Myofibrillar alkaline proteinase activity increases postoperatively and in patients suffering from malignant tumors, whereas normal proteinase values were observed in these patients following total parenteral nutrition. Increased alkaline proteinase activity is also observed in diabetes mellitus and is normalized by insulin. Extracellular proteolysis has been reported in patients with hypercatabolic acute renal failure and in patients with sepsis or acute pancreatitis. Plasma fractions obtained from hypercatabolic patients with postoperative acute renal failure were proteolytic. Plasma proteinase activity decreases during hemodialysis due to elimination of a metallo-proteinase. Plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin decreases in patients with acute renal failure and also during acute pancreatitis. Proteolytic degradation of parathyroid hormone by sera obtained from patients with acute pancreatitis has been observed. Also, there is a decrease of high molecular weight kininogen during experimental acute pancreatitis. Granulocyte elastase increases postoperatively, mainly in patients with sepsis. Sepsis also causes increased proteolytic activity in the urine. In conclusion, intracellular protein degradation can supply important precursors for hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis during malnutrition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. Means of these renal \"pathology scores\" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The highest counts and scores were found in rats given NDGA and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. Counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either NDGA or endotoxin. Results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of NDGA as causes of nephropathy. They indicate that endotoxin and NDGA act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free NDGA-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.\r"

Cardiac function was assessed before, during and after a run of H HDF and HD using echocardiography and impedance cardiography in 10 patients in a randomized cross-over sequence, two months after stabilization on each treatment. Blood biochemistry was performed before and after each run. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly higher before the H HDF run, compared to the HD run, and this difference persisted during and after the treatment runs (both P less than 0.05). There was a corresponding significant difference in the increase of the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and in the reduction of end systolic diameter during and after H HDF (P less than 0.05). Heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure did not differ significantly between the two treatments. Plasma calcium and bicarbonate were significantly higher (P less than 0.03) at the start of H HDF and this difference was enhanced at the end of the run. In conclusion, H HDF compared with HD, is associated with a better myocardial function in both the short and long term treatments. The evidence suggests that this may be due to improved levels of plasma calcium, bicarbonate, and/or the removal of an as yet unidentified myocardial toxin.\r"

The extent to which this method provides reliable and valid information for research purposes, and how its accuracy and usefulness can be enhanced, is examined. A review of methodological studies in the alcohol literature shows that although the information obtained from alcoholics and heavy drinkers tends to be reliable and valid, there can be considerable variability in accuracy, depending on the sensitivity of the information sought, the specificity of the validation criteria, the personal characteristics of the respondents and the demand characteristics of the task. It is suggested that the question of whether verbal report procedures are valid or invalid is less important than the issue of how they can be improved to the point that confidence can be placed in their findings. To facilitate this process, methodological techniques likely to enhance validity are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Although survival after cardiac transplantation has improved since the introduction of cyclosporine to clinical practice in 1980, the long-term hemodynamic results of transplantation in cyclosporine-treated recipients has not been reported. Annual cardiac catheterization data for 109 cyclosporine-treated recipients were analyzed and compared to those of a nonconcurrent group of 65 recipients treated with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Recipient age, donor age, sex, and human leukocyte antigen mismatch were comparable for the two groups. Satisfactory left ventricular function of the cyclosporine-treated heart was characterized on the first annual study by a normal ejection fraction (60% +/- 10%), cardiac index (3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2) and stroke work index (53 +/- 15 gm-m/m2) associated with moderately increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (12 +/- 6 mm Hg) and significantly increased mean aortic pressures (116 +/- 8 mm Hg). With the exception of aortic diastolic pressure, which tended to increase with time, the mean values of each variable analyzed did not change significantly over the period of study. In comparison to the azathioprine group, the cyclosporine cohort displayed higher aortic, left ventricular end-diastolic, and pulmonary artery pressures and produced more stroke work at each annual study. Analysis of the azathioprine group over extended (8 year) follow-up suggested excellent preservation of graft function. In summary, the long-term hemodynamic function of the transplanted heart treated with cyclosporine was satisfactory, demonstrated no deterioration over 5 year follow-up, but manifested substantially greater hypertension than hearts from the pre-cyclosporine era.\r"

Phosphocreatine (8 to 10 mmol/L) in a blood cardioplegic solution was used in operations on 41 patients; in the control group (37 patients) standard blood cardioplegia was used. In the group with phosphocreatine treatment we observed more rapid recovery of hemodynamics after release of the aortic cross-clamp, a decreased frequency of fibrillation, and more frequent restoration of sinus rhythm even if there were sinus rhythm disturbances before aortic cross-clamping. Analysis of the biopsy samples taken from the right ventricle showed protection of the sarcolemma against ischemic damage afforded by phosphocreatine and complete preservation of high-energy phosphates. The results obtained confirm the conclusion made by Robinson, Braimbridge, and Hearse (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1984; 87:190-200) that phosphocreatine is an effective additional cardioprotective agent when used in cardioplegic solutions.\r"

  ".U": "88037248\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy of coronary bypass grafting obviously being linked to graft patency, it is compulsory to look for any innovation that could improve the patency rate. Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet drug, was tested against placebo in a double-blind trial: 173 patients (475 grafts) subjected to venous coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly treated with ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) or placebo from the second postoperative day for 12 months. Graft patency was assessed by digital angiography on days 10 (99.4% of the patients), 180 (98.2%), and 360 (91.7%). The effect of treatment on platelet aggregation and bleeding time were measured concomitantly; a clear-cut effect was demonstrated at each interval. Intention-to-treat graft-by-graft analysis shows that ticlopidine significantly reduced the graft occlusion rate on day 10 (7.1% versus 13.4%, p less than 0.05), day 180 (15.0% versus 24.0%, p less than 0.02), and day 360 (15.9% versus 26.1%, p less than 0.01). Sequential grafts to the left anterior descending coronary artery, with side-to-side anastomosis to diagonal branch(es), are less frequently occluded than individual grafts. On the contrary, grafts to endarterectomized vessels occlude more frequently. Individual patient-by-patient analysis shows that patency of all grafts at each study time, is more frequent in the ticlopidine group. The difference is significant when one considers patients without sequential or endarterectomized grafts. The difference is also present at each study time: day 10 (84.4% versus 66.7%, p less than 0.05), day 180 (74.4% versus 52.3%, p less than 0.05) and day 360 (75.0% versus 52.5%, p less than 0.05). Results are even more impressive if one excludes from analysis the four patients in the ticlopidine group in whom administration of the drug was delayed. This supports previous suggestions that early therapy is necessary. These results show that graft occlusion occurs mainly in the first 6 postoperative months. The incidence of occlusion is significantly reduced by ticlopidine therapy.\r"

They are well absorbed after oral administration, and some achieve serum and tissue levels well exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations for susceptible bacteria. Adverse reactions are rare, and when they occur they are usually mild. Use of quinolones should be avoided in children because of possible damage to developing cartilage. These agents should prove useful in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by bacteria resistant to other oral agents, bacterial gastroenteritis, and gonococcal infections. The use of quinolones may potentially reduce the cost of treatment of certain systemic infections caused by multiantimicrobial resistant organisms because outpatient oral therapy is possible.\r"

It has been used for the treatment of trichomoniasis for almost 30 years and is also effective in amebiasis and giardiasis. More recently, metronidazole has emerged as a principal agent for the treatment of anaerobic infections. It is highly effective against all species of anaerobes except certain non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and cocci and is the only agent rapidly bactericidal against the Bacteroides fragilis group. The hydroxy metabolite is 65% as effective as metronidazole and may play a major therapeutic role. Clinical studies have substantiated its efficacy for prophylaxis during elective colorectal surgical procedures and the treatment of deep abdominal sepsis (usually in combination with another agent such as an aminoglycoside). Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis and seems to be as effective as vancomycin for treatment of Clostridium difficile-related diarrhea and colitis. Good blood levels are produced after both oral and intravenous administration, and side effects are infrequent and minimal. Metronidazole should not be taken during the first trimester of pregnancy because of concerns about mutagenicity. Tinidazole and ornidazole are recently developed nitroimidazole derivatives that have even greater antimicrobial activity than metronidazole.\r"

  ".W": "In infants and children, drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may differ considerably from these factors in adults; thus, differences also exist in therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of various antibiotics. Because of known toxicity, certain drugs--such as chloramphenicol in high doses, the sulfonamides, and tetracycline--should not be used in neonates. Antibiotic therapy should be modified in neonates because of biologic immaturity of organs important for the termination of drug action. Because of poor conjugation, inactivation, or excretion, the serum concentrations of many antibiotics may be higher and more prolonged in neonates than in older infants. Thus, the dosages of many antibiotics must be lower and the intervals between administration must be longer. The appearance of strains of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, the slow development of resistance to chloramphenicol among gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and the development of improved analytic methods to measure chloramphenicol have all resulted in the use of this drug in select cases of serious infection in children beyond the neonatal age. Third-generation cephalosporins have an important role in empiric treatment of pediatric bacterial meningitis because of their ability to penetrate the central nervous system and their effectiveness against ampicillin- or chloramphenicol-resistant Haemophilus strains and against many gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae group.\r"

The natural history of these patients has not been clearly defined. Therefore, to develop a comparison cohort of patients with unoperated aortic stenosis, we reviewed the records of all Mayo Clinic patients in whom severe aortic stenosis had been diagnosed during the period 1978 through 1985 but no surgical procedure had been performed because the patient declined or the physician deferred this option. Among the 50 patients identified (36 men and 14 women; mean age 77 years, range 60 to 89 years), an operation was declined by 28 and deferred in 22. The diagnosis of aortic stenosis was established clinically by a cardiologist in all 50 patients and independently confirmed by echocardiography, Doppler ultrasonography, or catheterization in 47 of the 50. All patients were symptomatic. Follow-up was complete to September 1986 or death in all 50 patients. Actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 57, 37, and 25%, respectively. Survival of age- and sex-matched control subjects was 93, 85, and 77%, respectively (P less than 0.0001 at each 1-year interval). At last follow-up, only 13 of the 50 patients (26%) were alive. A cardiac cause was cited for 36 of the 37 deaths. Because of the poor survival in this group of patients, evaluation of alternative nonsurgical therapeutic modalities such as balloon valvuloplasty is imperative when operative intervention is declined or deferred in elderly patients.\r"

We report our results of a small, double-blind, randomized trial in which the effectiveness of intragastric balloons was compared with that of conventional medical therapy for obesity. Twenty-two patients, who were 21 to 77% over ideal body weight, were studied. Eleven underwent insertion of an intragastric balloon, and 11 underwent sham procedures. One patient with a gastric balloon withdrew from the study after 3 days. Weight loss at 2 to 3 months in the conventional therapy group averaged 2.8 kg; in the balloon-treated group, the mean weight loss was 5.8 kg (P greater than 0.15). Of the 10 balloons, 8 spontaneously deflated, and 1 was passed in the stools. We noted gastric erosions in five patients and multiple gastric ulcers in one. We conclude that the intragastric balloon was not clearly effective in inducing weight loss, had a high rate of spontaneous deflation, and was damaging to the gastric mucosa. Controlled trials should be done before similar weight-reduction devices are used in routine clinical practice.\r"

Despite the lack of experimental evidence that prenatal drainage of the obstructed urinary tract substantially improves ultimate renal function, various forms of percutaneous intervention on the fetal bladder and kidney have been used. To evaluate the efficacy of intervention for suspected fetal obstructive uropathy, all published reports of drainage of the fetal urinary tract up to December, 1985, were reviewed. In the 57 reported cases, the most common type of intervention was placement of a vesicoamniotic shunt (37%). Complications occurred in 25 cases (44%), including inadequate shunt drainage or migration (19%), onset of premature labour within 48 h (12%), urinary ascites (7%), and chorioamnionitis (5%). Of 28 fetuses with associated oligohydramnios, only 6 (21%) survived. 2 of these survivors had vesicoamniotic shunts, 2 single or multiple bladder aspirations, 1 an external renal drainage catheter, and 1 in-utero vesicostomy. Because of the high complication rate and lack of evidence of improved survival from in-utero drainage procedures, a prospective, randomised trial is needed to compare survival with and without vesicoamniotic shunt placement.\r"

However, evidence from studies in man and the murine model of CMV show that virus replication in the lung is unrelated to the development of pathological effects, and that a host immune response is required for the induction of pneumonitis. Thus the hypothesis is that limited CMV replication in the lungs leads to display of a virus-coded protein, which is recognised by host T-cells, and that the pneumonitis is due to an uncontrolled accumulation and recruitment of such cells in the lungs. The reason why CMV is found in the lungs of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) without producing pneumonitis is probably because these patients cannot mount the pathogenic T-cell response. According to the hypothesis stated here, if the immune capabilities of AIDS patients can be restored, life-threatening CMV pneumonitis may develop.\r"

The time to vivax relapse was significantly longer after mefloquine treatment (median 47 days, range 30-65) than after quinine or quinidine treatment (21 days, 15-36; p less than 0.0001). All patients remained outside areas of malaria transmission. These findings suggest a very high rate of double infection in Thailand with acute suppression of vivax by falciparum malaria, and warrant evaluation of radical therapy with primaquine in certain patients with acute falciparum malaria.\r"

In all patients with active cirrhosis hepatocytes showed a strong intracellular staining with anti-Pc; in 4 of them bileducts also showed a membrane-like reaction. By contrast, tissue sections from chronic inactive liver disease and normal liver were essentially negative. These findings suggest that in chronic liver disease hepatocytes and sometimes biliary epithelium produce collagen and that production is related to disease activity. The detection of active production of procollagen type I by hepatocytes could become a useful marker of progressive liver disease.\r"

Relapse was more likely (66%) in patients with a recurrence of C pylori after apparent eradication of the organism than in those who remained negative for C pylori (10%). No patient who remained negative for C pylori had histological gastritis, whereas all with recurrence of C pylori showed histological gastritis. These findings suggest an important role for C pylori in duodenal ulcer relapse in the year after treatment.\r"

Distilled water and citric acid challenge were not significantly changed by captopril pretreatment. However, captopril significantly shifted the dose-response curve to capsaicin inhalation. The geometric mean dose of capsaicin causing 20 coughs/min was 1.3 mumol/l for captopril and 2.8 mumol/l for placebo pretreatment (p = 0.04). Cough is a recognised side-effect of ACE inhibitors; the observation that cough challenge is changed by these drugs in normal subjects implies a role for ACE in the cough reflex, possibly by metabolism of substrates other than angiotensin I.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983, a comprehensive programme was introduced to halt the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and to reduce mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Alaskan Natives, in whom the incidence of HBV infection was high. This programme includes: serological screening of all Alaskan Natives; immunisation of susceptible persons, including all newborn babies, with hepatitis B vaccine; and testing HBsAg-positive carriers twice a year for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to detect HCC at an early stage. By October, 1986, over 53,000 Alaskan Natives (84% of the total Native population) had been tested for HBV serological markers and 80% of the identified susceptibles had been or were being vaccinated against HBV. After complete immunisation of 90% of the susceptibles in the area with the highest infection rates in Alaska, the annual incidence of acute symptomatic HBV infection decreased from 215 to 14 cases per 100,000 population. After the introduction of AFP screening, the 1-year-case-fatality rate for HCC fell, from 100%, to 50%.\r"

This paper reports seven patients in whom outer table cranial bone grafts were used to reconstruct post-traumatic facial deformities. These included orbital and zygomatic deformities (2 patients), maxillary defects (2 patients), mandibular defects (2 patients), and nasal deformity (1 patient). A brief review of the development of membranous bone grafting for maxillofacial reconstruction is given. Good cosmetic results were obtained in six of seven patients with no evidence of graft resorption. One patient required removal of the graft because of inadequate soft tissue coverage. No patient suffered any significant donor site morbidity. In summary, this technique is extremely useful in treating post-traumatic bony deformities of the facial skeleton. The excellent graft survival and ease in harvesting the graft make this technique preferable to traditional endochondral grafts taken from the iliac crest and rib.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized, double-blind five-year trial, we tested the efficacy of simultaneously elevating serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lowering levels of non-HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in 4081 asymptomatic middle-aged men (40 to 55 years of age) with primary dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 200 mg per deciliter [5.2 mmol per liter] in two consecutive pretreatment measurements). One group (2051 men) received 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily, and the other (2030 men) received placebo. Gemfibrozil caused a marked increase in HDL cholesterol and persistent reductions in serum levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. There were minimal changes in serum lipid levels in the placebo group. The cumulative rate of cardiac end points at five years was 27.3 per 1,000 in the gemfibrozil group and 41.4 per 1,000 in the placebo group--a reduction of 34.0 percent in the incidence of coronary heart disease (95 percent confidence interval, 8.2 to 52.6; P less than 0.02; two-tailed test). The decline in incidence in the gemfibrozil group became evident in the second year and continued throughout the study. There was no difference between the groups in the total death rate, nor did the treatment influence the cancer rates. The results are in accord with two previous trials with different pharmacologic agents and indicate that modification of lipoprotein levels with gemfibrozil reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease in men with dyslipidemia.\r"

In liver, connexons consist of six protein subunits which, until now, were believed to be identical. However, besides the major polypeptide of relative molecular mass (Mr) 28,000 (and see refs 4 and 6), a component of Mr 21,000 (21K) has been repeatedly observed in liver. The amino-terminal sequence (18 residues) of this less abundant protein shows that it is related to, but distinct from, the Mr 28K protein. Immuno-staining and immuno-precipitation show both proteins to be in the same gap junctional plaques. Thus, it seems that hepatic gap junction channels (and by extension possibly others) are composed of two (or more) homologous proteins.\r"

Two highly conserved amino-acid sequences found in rhino-, polio-, and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) viruses are located near the base of this site and could be important in maintaining its topology. We have prepared site-specific antibodies to two synthetic peptides which include these sequences. The antibodies bind to the predicted capsid proteins of rhinovirus and neutralize approximately 60% of 48 rhinovirus serotypes tested. These results could provide a route to a rhinovirus vaccine effective against most of the numerous serotypes of this virus.\r"

  ".W": "The substance 3,5,3-triiodothyronine (T3) stimulates growth hormone gene transcription in rat pituitary tumour cells. This stimulation is thought to be mediated by the binding of nuclear T3 receptors to regulatory elements 5' to the transcriptional start site. Understanding of the mechanism by which thyroid hormone activates gene transcription has been limited by failure to purify nuclear T3 receptors because of their low abundance, and by the absence of defined T3 receptor-DNA binding sites affecting T3 regulation. Recently, human and avian c-erb-A gene products have been shown to bind thyroid hormone with high affinity and to have a molecular weight and nuclear association characteristic of the thyroid hormone receptor. In the present report, we describe the development of an avidin-biotin complex DNA-binding assay which can detect specific, high-affinity binding of rat pituitary cell T3 receptors to the sequence 5'CAGGGACGTGACCGCA3', located 164 base pairs 5' to the transcriptional start site of the rat growth hormone gene. An oligonucleotide containing this sequence transferred T3 regulation to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in transfected rat pituitary GC2 cells, and specifically bound an in vitro translation product of the human placental c-erb-A gene. The data provide supporting evidence that the human c-erb-A gene product mediates the transcriptional effects of T3 and also that GC2 cell nuclear extracts contain additional factors that modify the binding of pituitary T3 receptors to the rat growth hormone gene T3 response element.\r"

This microenvironment is composed of stromal cells, soluble factors and extracellular matrix (ECM). We have shown that a complex extract of bone marrow ECM can stimulate the growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cells in vitro. Furthermore, the use of inhibitors or stimulators of ECM synthesis in long-term marrow culture affects cell proliferation. On a molecular level, however, the interactions between ECM and haematopoietic cells are not well understood. We have investigated the adhesion between specific bone marrow ECM components and haematopoietic cells, and found a protein, 'haemonectin', of relative molecular mass 60,000 in bone marrow ECM which is a lineage- and organ-specific attachment molecule for cells of granulocyte lineage. This specificity distinguishes haemonectin from previously described adhesion proteins which have a wider tissue distribution and cell type specificity.\r"

  ".W": "The neuropeptide receptors which are present in very small quantities in the cell and are embedded tightly in the plasma membrane have not been well characterized. Mammals contain three distinct tachykinin neuropeptides, substance P, substance K and neuromedin K, and it has been suggested that there are multiple tachykinin receptors. By electrophysiological measurement, we have previously shown that Xenopus oocytes injected with brain and stomach mRNAs faithfully express mammalian substance-P and substance-K receptors, respectively. Here we report the isolation of the cDNA clone for bovine substance-K receptor (SKR) by extending this method to develop a new cloning strategy. We constructed a stomach cDNA library with a cloning vector that allowed in vitro synthesis of mRNAs and then identified a particular cDNA clone by testing for receptor expression following injection of the mRNAs synthesized in vitro into the oocyte system. Because oocytes injected with exogenous mRNAs can express numerous receptors and channels, our new strategy will be applicable in the general molecular cloning of these proteins. The result provides the first indication that the neuropeptide receptor has sequence similarity with rhodopsin-type receptors (the G-protein-coupled receptor family) and thus possesses multiple membrane-spanning domains.\r"

A complementary DNA clone encoding LFA-3 was isolated using a complementary DNA clone encoding LFA-3 was isolated using a novel transient expression system of mouse cells. The cDNA encodes a phospholipid-linked membrane protein whose extracellular domain shares significant homology with CD2. As CD2 is homologous with the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM in immunoglobulin-like domains, cellular adhesion molecules in both neural and lymphoid tissues could have a common ancestor.\r"

Most cell surface membrane proteins are anchored by a membrane-spanning segment(s) of the polypeptide chain, but another type of anchor has been described for several proteins: a phosphatidyl inositol glycan moiety, attached to the protein C terminus. This type of linkage has been identified on membrane proteins involved in adhesion and transmembrane signalling and could be important in the execution of these functions. We report here that an immunologically important adhesion glycoprotein, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), can be anchored to the membrane by both types of mechanism. These two distinct cell-surface forms of LFA-3 are derived from different biosynthetic precursors. The existence of a phosphatidyl-inositol-linked and a transmembrane anchored form of LFA-3 has important implications for adhesion and transmembrane signalling by LFA-3.\r"

Dinitrogenase contains a unique prosthetic group (iron-molybdenum cofactor, FeMoco) comprised of Fe, Mo and S, which has been proposed as the site of N2 reduction. Biochemical and genetic studies of Nif- (nitrogen fixation) mutants of Klebsiella pneumoniae which are defective in nitrogen fixation, have shown that the nifB, nifQ, nifN, nifE and nifV genes are required for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co. Recently, a system for in vitro synthesis of FeMoco was described. The assay requires at least the nifB, nifN and nifE gene products, and a low-molecular-weight factor (V factor) produced in the presence of the nifV gene product. We have used this system to study FeMoco biosynthesis. We report here the isolation of V factor and identify it as homocitric acid ([R]2-hydroxy-1,2,4-butanetricarboxylic acid).\r"

It has been suggested that steric hindrance by Val-E11 and His-E7 and a hydrogen bond between His-E7 and oxygen affect the geometry and electronic state of the Fe-ligand bond, and that these interactions may be important in controlling oxygen affinity. We have produced mutant haemoglobins in E. coli having Val(67 beta)E11 replaced by Ala, Met, Leu or Ile and His(58 beta)E7 by Gln, Val or Gly. We have studied the effect of these mutations on the equilibrium and kinetics of ligand binding. The conformation of the new side chains and their effect on the protein structure have been examined by X-ray crystallography, and the vibrational properties of the Fe-CO bond observed by resonance Raman spectroscopy. We found that the steric hindrance of ligand binding by the E11 residue and the polarity of the E7 residue in the beta subunit are critical for fine-tuning ligand affinity.\r"

At one end of the signalling chain, the structure of the insulin receptor is known in detail, and at the other end, insulin controls cellular metabolism by regulating the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in key target enzymes. The molecular events linking the occupied receptor to changes in target enzyme phosphorylation have remained obscure. Recently, insulin was shown to promote the hydrolysis of a phosphatidylinositol glycan with release of its polar head-group. The head group was reported to activate a high-affinity cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, to inhibit catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, and also to inhibit phospholipid methyltransferase and adenylate cyclase. We report here that in intact adipocytes this head-group faithfully copies the insulin-directed effects on the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of target proteins of the hormone.\r"

The expression of these proteins, referred to as MRP-8 and MRP-14, is specific for cells of myeloid origin, namely granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages, and is observed in blood granulocytes and monocytes but not in normal tissue macrophages. In acutely inflamed tissues, macrophages can express MRP-14 but not MRP-8, and in chronic inflammations, such as primary chronic polyarthritis, infiltrate macrophages express both MRP-8 and MRP-14. Characterization of MRP-8 and MRP-14 could therefore be useful to the understanding of cellular processes induced in chronic inflammation.\r"

We have used these results to test a recently developed method for the calculation of electrostatic interactions between two specific sites on a protein. The extent of agreement between the theoretical and experimental results suggests that the continuum solvent model used in the calculations reproduces the essential features of the interaction.\r"

Electrostatic effects in proteins can be modelled by the algorithm of Warwicker and Watson, which uses classical electrostatics and considers both the charge position and the shape of the molecule. Here we report that the algorithm can model several pKa shifts in subtilisin to fair accuracy.\r"

Using a novel simultaneous two-colour immunolabelling technique, we have found that these centrifugal fibres are often closely apposed to the dopaminergic interplexiform cells. Contacts between centrifugal fibres and dopaminergic interplexiform cells were observed by electron microscopy to be conventional type synaptic junctions. Since the dopaminergic interplexiform cells make synapses on horizontal and bipolar cells, providing an intraretinal centrifugal pathway for information flow from the inner to the outer plexiform layers, we conclude that every neuron in the teleost retina is potentially susceptible to central influences via these centrifugal fibres and dopaminergic interplexiform cells.\r"

The distinctive preleukaemic and leukaemic phases of this disease make it an attractive model for neoplastic progression in human tumours. We reasoned that, because dominantly transforming genes (such as mutant alleles of ras proto-oncogenes) are found so frequently in acute leukaemia, the search for these genetic lesions during the clinical course of patients with MDS might give us insight into the function of oncogenes in leukaemogenesis. We report here that bone marrow cells from two of four patients with preleukaemia, and from one patient who progressed to acute leukaemia from MDS, contained a transforming allele of the Ki-ras proto-oncogene. In one preleukaemic patient, a novel mutation in codon 13 of this ras gene was detected in bone marrow cells harvested 1.5 years before the acute leukaemia developed. Our findings provide evidence that ras mutations may be involved in the early stages of human leukaemia.\r"

The two types of processes differ in their morphology, in their rate of growth, in the macromolecular composition of their cytoskeletons and surface membranes, and in their synaptic polarity. When hippocampal neurons are dissociated from the embryonic brain and cultured, they reproducibly establish this basic form with a single axon and several dendrites, despite the absence of any spatially organized environmental cues, and without the need for cell to cell contact. We have cut the axons of young hippocampal neurons within a day of their development: in some cases the initial axon regenerated, but more frequently one of the other processes, which if undisturbed would have become a dendrite, instead became the axon. Frequently the stump of the original axon persisted following the transection and subsequently became a dendrite. Evidently the neuronal processes that first develop in culture have the capacity to form either axons or dendrites. The acquisition of axonal characteristics by one neuronal process apparently inhibits the others from becoming axons, so they subsequently become dendrites.\r"

  ".U": "88039141\r", 
  ".W": "Genes involved in the transduction of signals required for normal cell proliferation commonly appear to be subverted in the neoplastic process. One such group is the highly conserved family of ras genes, which have been detected as transforming genes in a wide variety of naturally occurring tumours. By analogy with other known G proteins, the p21 proteins encoded by ras genes may act as regulatory proteins in the transduction of signals that lead to DNA synthesis. A major pathway involved in the DNA synthesis induced by growth factors is mediated by phosphatidylinositol turnover: cleavage of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C produces 1,2-diacylglycerol, and inositol phosphates. The former acts as an essential cofactor for protein kinase C (ref. 4), and inositol-(1,4,5)-triphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial intracellular stores. We demonstrate a reproducible increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol, in the absence of a detectable increase in inositol phosphates, in transformed cells containing Ha-ras oncogenes and with different membrane targeting signals for the ras p21 protein. These findings suggest that a source other than phosphoinositides exists for the generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol and that the Ha-ras oncogene specifically activates this novel pathway for 1,2-diacylglycerol production.\r"

The rate of ischemic complications is lower than that associated with carotid ligation, and the rate of subsequent hemorrhage is lower than that associated with either carotid ligation or direct clipping. Therefore, for many internal carotid artery aneurysms that originate at or proximal to the ophthalmic artery, the nondetachable balloon technique is an alternative treatment choice. During a 7-year period, 21 aneurysms of the internal carotid artery were treated by the nondetachable balloon technique. All 21 aneurysms were successfully excluded from the circulatory system by either proximal occlusion or trapping of the aneurysm neck. This series consisted of 8 carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysms, 11 carotid-cavernous aneurysms (6 spontaneous, 5 traumatic), 1 petrous segment aneurysm, and 1 cervical segment aneurysm. At 3 years of follow-up, the following incidences were noted: transient ischemia, 4.7%; infarction, 9.6%; and hemorrhage, 0%. The complications were 1 case of transient hemiparesis and 2 late ischemic events. Fifty per cent of the patients underwent follow-up computed tomography, and thrombosis of the aneurysm was confirmed in all except one case, which was partially thrombosed.\r"

We present the case of a 29-year-old, albino, black man with Ollier's disease who, as a child, underwent a number of orthopedic procedures for multiple limb deformities and fractures. At age 25, he developed hydrocephalus, progressive cranial nerve palsies, and a large enchondroma of the skull base. He subsequently underwent multiple shunt procedures and two suboccipital craniectomies. Eighteen months later, a brain computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed an intracerebellar mass, which was found to be an anaplastic astrocytoma. Two years later, he developed a right hemiparesis and sensory dysfunction with a diffuse supratentorial mass on CT scan. A stereotactic biopsy showed this to be a similar anaplastic astrocytoma. The literature concerning Ollier's disease is reviewed, and the intracerebral lesions associated with both Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are examined.\r"

The abscesses usually involved the mid to lower cervical region and extended an average of three to four segments. Neck stiffness was present in all patients; root pain and paresthesias were present less often. Weakness of one to four extremities developed in all but one patient. Sensory levels were frequently present, sometimes below the site of the lesion. All but two patients were febrile. All but two had elevated CSF protein, and all but two had a pleocytosis; myelography always revealed a complete or partial block. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in 8 of 11 patients. CEA should be considered in a patient with neck stiffness, paresthesias, and/or radicular pain so that CT or myelography followed by surgical decompression and/or antimicrobial drugs can be initiated before prolonged weakness develops. One of our patients developed a syrinx causing a new neurologic deficit 3 years after treatment. Delayed syringomyelia, a rare complication of extramedullary lesions, lends support to vascular occlusion as the major mechanism of damage in epidural abscess.\r"

Of 1,517 corneal donors, 5 (0.3%) were repeatedly reactive by enzyme immunoassay. For comparison, 131 (0.06%) of 206,415 blood donors in Houston were similarly seropositive during this same 1-year period. Routine serological testing can be successfully implemented by eye banking personnel to potentially reduce the risk of viral transmission by keratoplasty.\r"

This disparity has been attributed to variations in the ganglion cell characteristics across the retina, most notably that of spatial summation. The hypothesis was further investigated by M-scaling the perimetric sensitivity recorded under conditions favouring reduced spatial summation, namely an increased adaptation level and a longer stimulus duration afforded by the Humphrey Field Analyzer. The M-scaled data exhibited a paracentral reduction in sensitivity relative to the theoretical isosensitive profile and an increased sensitivity beyond an eccentricity of 12 degrees. This indicates that for perimetric spot stimuli, the current human M-scaling equations under represent the fovea at the visual cortex. The implications for the design of perimetric routines are discussed.\r"

Eight cases of ameloblastic carcinoma from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) are reported. The mean age of patients was 30.1 years, with no sex predilection noted. Seven cases involved the mandible and one involved the maxilla, with the posterior regions favored. The most common sign was swelling, although pain, rapid growth, trismus, and dysphonia also occurred. Lesions characteristically were evident as ill-defined destructive radiolucencies, with occasional radiopacities noted. Histologic features generally resembled those of conventional ameloblastoma but with cytologic features of epithelial malignant disease. The clinical course was uniformly aggressive with extensive local destruction and spread, frequent recurrences, and one case of neck node metastasis. The nomenclature and classification of odontogenic carcinomas are discussed, as well as entities that should be included in the differential diagnosis. Further reporting of ameloblastic carcinoma is encouraged.\r"

The influence of angulation changes between the x-ray source and object on the quality of the subtracted image was measured with the visualization of a thin chip of bone (thickness less than or equal to 0.85 mm). Twenty radiographic image pairs that differed by known geometric distortions ranging from 0 to 9 degrees horizontal and vertical were subtracted. The ability to detect a thickness change varied strongly with angular distortion. Under optimal conditions (no distortion), DSR was able to detect a change in thickness of cortical bone of 0.12 mm. Under approximately clinical circumstances (3 degree misalignment), a thickness change of 0.35 mm was detected with 50% accuracy (three of six cases), while a thickness change of 0.42 mm was detected with 100% accuracy (six of six cases). In addition, the influence of exposure parameters on DSR was investigated. Twenty-one radiographic film pairs were subtracted with differing densities and contrasts. Images made at 70 kVp with an optical density of 0.61 in the dentin produced the best subtracted images. However, even images made with one fourth the conventional exposure produced diagnostic information when analyzed with DSR; this was not seen with conventional analysis of the normally exposed radiographic films.\r"

The radiographs were digitized and, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the intensity value of the second image was subtracted from the reference image to produce a third, subtracted image. The subtracted image provided a significantly improved visualization of the condyle's superior surface.\r"

The contralateral hip must be examined carefully as there may be bilateral disease with the pain and disability of the presenting side masking the symptoms of less involved hip. SCFE is occasionally associated with other metabolic and endocrinologic disease, and these should be screened for in the history and physical examination. Once a slip begins, the hip remains at jeopardy for acute progression until the physeal plate closes. We recommend immediate surgical stabilization and prefer a cannulated screw system. Proper technique is critical to safe and reliable surgery.

Contraindications to CSTR include radiographic evidence of a flat-top talus and uncorrected anterior ankle contractures. The Cincinnati incision, which permits excellent visualization of all the relevant structures and good cosmesis, is described and compared with other approaches. The technique of the CSTR is described in detail. Key steps include marking the knee for later alignment with the foot (a major advantage of this procedure), superficial medial dissection, posterior dissection, lateral dissection, and deep medial dissection. Technical details and criteria for evaluation are provided. Four supplemental procedures and their indications are described. These include metatarsal osteotomy, calcaneocuboid capsulotomy, calcaneal wedge osteotomy, and plantar release. Procedures for pinning and casting are described, with special attention to accuracy of realigning the foot and measures for avoiding avascular necrosis and other complications. The importance of intraoperative radiographs is presented, together with methods for obtaining and assessing these films to assure that surgical correction is complete. It is imperative that these films be taken before tendon repair or wound closure so that pinning procedures can be repeated, if necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The goal in managing the lower extremity in a child with spina bifida is to achieve a pattern of development as near normal as possible. Lower limb deformities are produced by muscle imbalance, weight-bearing, and the postural effects of gravity. At any point in time, the management of the lower extremities will depend on the child's general development. Lower limb paralysis, hydrocephalus, bladder infections, hydromyelia, and Arnold Chiari malformation, all contribute to developmental delay. A child's potential for mobility varies with the severity of the motor and sensory deficit. Surgery is done to correct deformity, provide joint stability, and improve joint mobility. The results of surgery will be compromised if the child is not neurologically stable, or if appropriate therapy and orthotic care are not available. Muscle imbalance produces the problem of deformity and instability of the hip. Deformity must be corrected if the child is to assume an upright posture. Instability is of concern only in those children with a strong quadriceps muscle. Hip surgery for instability should be limited to one procedure, which must achieve a stable concentric reduction and balance the muscle forces about the hip. The common deformities seen at the knee are recurvatum, knee flexion contractures, and genu valgum. Most knee deformities can be corrected by soft tissue procedures. Well-designed orthoses rocker sole shoes, and appropriate gait training help prevent knee deformities. The goal in managing foot deformities is to achieve a plantigrade foot with stable skin. Whenever there is a problem with sensation, concentrated pressure in one area of a deformed foot will lead to skin breakdown. Surgical procedures must completely correct deformity and restore muscle imbalance. After surgery, meticulous orthotic care is required to prevent skin breakdown and avoid loss of correction. The orthopedist has a significant role in helping a child with spina bifida to achieve a pattern of development as near normal as possible. He or she must work in concert with a team of professionals and realize that orthopedic surgery is but an incident in the habilitative program. This rather chatty narrative is based on spina bifida care experience, in Sheffield, Toronto, and Chicago.\r"

Effects on the central nervous system were also sought. Subjects received single oral doses of indomethacin 50 and 100 mg, dipipanone 8 mg and placebo, according to a double-blind, randomised, balanced, cross-over design with an interval of 7 days between occasions. A test battery was performed before each treatment and then at 45, 105 and 165 min post treatment. Pain scores were unaltered by indomethacin at either dose, but the drug certainly affected the CNS, increasing respiratory drive and changing self-assessed mood. It is concluded that the CP model is insensitive to indomethacin, even in doses which have clear-cut CNS effects. The respiratory stimulant action of indomethacin may deserve further study.\r"

Significantly fewer local and systemic reactions were reported in acetaminophen-treated infants at 2 to 6 months of age. Acetaminophen also reduced the incidence of fever greater than 38.0 degrees C from 44% to 27%. Only 0.9% of acetaminophen-treated infants had overall behavioral changes rated as severe by parents compared to 13% of the placebo group. Infants vaccinated at 18 months of age had higher rates of systemic and local reactions than younger infants. Acetaminophen did not result in significant reductions in reaction rates after the booster at 18 months. We conclude that acetaminophen administered at the time of primary vaccination with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus toxoids-polio can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of common adverse reactions.\r"

One hundred thirty-nine Shigella and 22 ETEC strains resistant to greater than 1024 micrograms/ml of trimethoprim (TMPr) isolated from children with diarrhea in Bangkok in 1984 and 1985 were analyzed for the presence of type I, II and III plasmid-specific dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes. Thirty-two percent (45 of 139) of TMPR Shigella had genes encoding type II and 9% (13 of 139) had genes encoding type I DHFR genes. Fifty percent (11 of 22) of TMPR ETEC had type II and 14% (3 of 22) had type I DHFR genes. Plasmids encoding DHFR were identified by the Southern technique in 24% (14 of 58) of Shigella and 1 of 14 ETEC that contained genes encoding DHFR. Plasmids coding for type II DHFR were transferred to E. coli K12 by conjugation from 13 of 14 Shigella and a plasmid coding for type I DHFR was transferred from the single ETEC containing a plasmid coding for type I DHFR. Genes coding for DHFR were presumably situated on the chromosome in 76% (44 of 58) of Shigella and 93% (13 of 14) of ETEC that contained genes encoding DHFR. Since 58% (81 of 139) of TMPR Shigella and 36% (8 of 22) of TMPR ETEC strains examined did not contain genes encoding type I, II or III DHFR, high level TMP resistance was presumably caused by other types of DHFR genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Despite their apparent normality many children have minimal brain damage and fall behind in intellectual achievement and social adjustment. Clearly no matter how effective therapy is in dealing with acute disease, it cannot prevent the development of handicapping sequelae in all children. For this reason I strongly believe that prevention of Hib meningitis is essential.\r"

Because reduced blood flow is measurable within 48 hours of acquisition of bacteria, the inability of antibiotic therapy to prevent sequelae is more easily understood insofar as damage has already occurred by the time treatment is initiated. Hydrocephalus is probably due to severe choroid plexus necrosis with aqueductal occlusion. These deficiencies, along with the neuronopathy, contribute to permanent cerebrocortical deficits, including impaired learning ability.\r"

The antibodies produced in response to the conjugates have the same biologic properties, isotype and IgG subclass composition as those elicited by Hib CPS alone or those present in serum after convalescence from Hib disease. More recently attempts have been made to make the conjugates compatible with DTP vaccine. In this procedure DTP is absorbed onto aluminum compounds (aluminum hydroxide or phosphate), with the effect of significantly prolonging diphtheria and tetanus antibody synthesis. Adsorption of the Hib CPS conjugate under controlled conditions does not alter the total amount of antibody elicited in infant rhesus monkeys after the third or final injection. The appearance of Hib CPS antibodies after the first injection, however, is accelerated with conjugate that has been adsorbed. This is an encouraging finding, because it means that more polysaccharide conjugates can be compatible with existing DTP vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "The inability of infants to respond to Hib PRP with the production of protective antibodies is probably in large part a consequence of the relative immaturity of their immune system. It has been reported that PRP-induced antibodies in adults are primarily of the IgG subclass 2 and that there is a higher frequency of invasive H. influenzae type b diseases among adults with limited antibody deficiencies when the IgG subclass 2 isotype is not present at normal levels. There is evidence that adult levels of IgG subclass 2 are attained later in life than are adult levels of the other subclasses. Regulation of the level of this IgG subclass will undoubtedly be an important determinant in the induction of anti-PRP antibodies in infants. It seems unlikely that simple modification of PRP, such as by increasing molecular size, would result in an increased effectiveness in younger infants, because this group is inherently unable to synthesize subclass 2 antibodies. Currently intensive efforts are being made in several laboratories to develop vaccines that conjugate PRP with proteins that are capable of eliciting a T cell-dependent response in younger children. Preliminary results of several ongoing clinical trials of vaccines of PRP conjugated with diphtheria and with tetanus toxoids indicate that these vaccines are efficacious in children as young as 7 months of age. Researchers are hopeful that vaccines can be developed to protect infants ages 2 to 3 months.\r"

The vaccine is well-tolerated and is not associated with clinically significant adverse reactions. The PRP-D vaccine has been shown to be a T cell-dependent immunogen, inducing sequential increases in antibody level with repeated immunization and producing a high proportion of IgG relative to IgM. A recall response, or immunologic memory effect, has been demonstrated in children 1 year after receiving PRP-D. PRP-D is consistently immunogenic in all age groups. In adults this vaccine induces a geometric mean antibody response greater than 200 micrograms/ml.

These results have raised expectations that the Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine can play an important role in helping to prevent measles in young infants in highly endemic areas. Because of the implications of changing the measles vaccine recommendations, vaccine advisory groups and vaccine manufacturers will require additional studies to confirm the preliminary findings and to answer new questions which have been raised. The needed data will probably be collected over the next year or two in studies already under way or being planned in the hope that a more effective vaccine for young infants can be introduced before the end of this decade.\r"

Of 95 strains that manifested localized adherence, 97% were EPEC adherence factor probe-positive; thus the HEp-2 assay may serve as an alternative to the probe in identifying EPEC adherence factor-positive EPEC. True diffuse adherence was not associated with diarrhea. In contrast the aggregative pattern appears to signify a new, distinct class of diarrheagenic E. coli (enteroadherent-aggregative E. coli). The aggregative pattern was found in only 3 of 27 enterotoxigenic, 0 of 4 enteroinvasive, 0 of 2 enterohemorrhagic and 2 of 86 EPEC strains but in 84 of 253 probe-negative strains (P less than 0.00001) from patients with diarrhea; in comparison only 20 of 134 probe-negative strains from controls were aggregative E. coli (P less than 0.00001 vs. probe-negative strains from diarrhea patients).\r"

Results indicate that early intervention is effective in promoting developmental progress in infants and toddlers with biologically based disabilities. Programs that served a heterogeneous group of children, provided a structured curriculum, and targeted their efforts on parents and children together appeared to be the most effective. Definitive evaluation of the efficacy of early intervention programs is tempered by the restricted range of outcomes measured and by a paucity of information about the children and families enrolled in such programs, as well as about the specific nature of the services received. Despite their limitations, available data provide the basis for a rational pediatric approach to early intervention programs, while highlighting specific directions for further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "From October 1985 through June 1986, 31 children in a single pediatric practice were treated for perianal signs and symptoms associated with growth of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci from perianal cultures. Signs and symptoms included perianal dermatitis (90%), perianal itching (78%), rectal pain (52%), and blood-streaked stools (35%). Ages ranged from 7 months to 8 years mean 4.25 +/- 1.8 years). There were 24 boys (77%) and seven girls (23%). The 31 cases occurred in 19 families. Intrafamily spread was only to siblings and occurred in 50% of the possible situations. Direct perianal antigen studies had a sensitivity of 89% for predicting positive cultures. Four different T types of group A streptococci were isolated from these cases, but the T type within each family outbreak was identical except in one case. When group A streptococci were found in the pharynx (64% of patients), the T type of the pharyngeal and perianal isolates were identical. Treatment was usually with oral penicillin. Relapses occurred in 39%. Signs of cellulitis were absent in all 31 cases and, therefore, we suggest that the nomenclature for this entity be changed from streptococcal perianal cellulitis to streptococcal perianal disease.\r"

  ".W": "The role of theophylline in weaning infants weighing less than 1,250 g at birth from mechanical ventilation was evaluated. Infants were randomized into control or theophylline treatment groups when they required minimal ventilatory support (peak inspiratory pressure 12 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure 2 cm H2O, rate 12 breaths per minute, and FiO2 less than 0.3), and they were extubated 24 hours later. Infants required reintubation if they had (1) PaCO2 greater than 55 mm Hg and pH less than 7.20, (2) FiO2 greater than 0.5, or (3) apnea associated with a heart rate less than 100 beats per minute that required frequent stimulation (more than 20 episodes during a 16-hour period). Among 32 infants (birth weight less than 1,000 g) who reached minimal ventilatory support before seven days after delivery, 13 of 18 (72%) control infants required reintubation, whereas only four of 14 (28%) theophylline-treated infants required reintubation. On the other hand, among infants (birth weight less than 1,000 g) who reached minimal ventilatory support after seven days following delivery, only one of six (17%) of the control group required reintubation and no improvement could be seen with theophylline treatment. Similarly, among control infants (birth weight 1,001 to 1,250 g), only ten of 45 (23%) required reintubation after reaching low intermittent manditory ventilation settings. In summary, most infants recovering from respiratory distress syndrome who had birth weights (1) greater than 1,000 g or (2) less than 1,000 g and who were older than seven days could be successfully extubated from minimal ventilatory support without theophylline treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Redesigning the dream was identified as the integrative theme in the substantive theory that described how family members gradually modify their beliefs about organ transplantation and develop attitudes and beliefs to meet the challenge of living with continual unpredictability. The theory consists of three concepts--immersion, passage, and negotiation--which parallel the stages of waiting for a donor, hospitalization, and recovery.\r"

Despite the limited research in this area, many American diabetic teaching programs have recently adopted a policy of encouraging ambulatory diabetics to reuse their syringes. However, the subject remains controversial. Of 166 subjects surveyed at a diabetic clinic, 74 (44.6%) reused their insulin syringes. Four syringes were found to be contaminated with normal skin flora. No pathogenic organisms were isolated. In addition, 15.1% of the subjects did not clean their hands or the site prior to the injection.\r"

Primary care physicians must be aware of the potentially serious or lethal nature of air gun injury and educate their patients accordingly.

We report five cases of potentially life-threatening injury caused by air guns, three of which required emergency laparotomy.\r"

Physicians may thus apply standard therapeutic modalities used in treating common poisonings to the child who drank a petroleum distillate. Prompt recognition of presenting symptoms and understanding of pathophysiology are important to planning and providing treatment. The two cases of hydrocarbon ingestion reported in this paper illustrate the wide spectrum of problems associated with this condition.

This paper suggests that the best approach toward a child's unexplained somatic symptoms is a biopsychosocial orientation that includes conversion reaction within the differential diagnosis. Comprehensive strategies are described for both diagnosis and management of conversion reactions so that both organic and psychosocial factors can be understood and addressed in the emergency department setting. Prognosis, epidemiology, and questions involving the definition of conversion reaction are also discussed. A follow-up paper will address specific diagnostic issues regarding both the general features and the most common presentations of conversion reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Although low-dose oral corticosteroid therapy cannot be considered remittive, it has earned a place in the therapeutic armamentarium for rheumatoid arthritis. Major clinical trials of a group using corticosteroid compared with a control group have not been done since the 1950s. One of these three large trials showed some slowing of the destructive joint changes of rheumatoid arthritis with use of low doses of corticosteroid. However, these agents have well-known side effects, especially when used long-term. Elderly patients or those who have features of the disease that indicate progression (eg, multiple joint involvement, elevated ESR, early evidence of erosion on x-ray films) are likely to benefit from carefully controlled doses of a corticosteroid. Because these drugs diminish bone formation and arthritis itself accelerates osteoporosis, supplemental calcium and vitamin D are useful adjuncts. A remittive agent and aspirin-like drug should be prescribed along with the corticosteroid. Abrupt withdrawal of even a very low dose of corticosteroids in rheumatoid arthritis patients causes a flare.\r"

If the blood glucose is actually abnormally low and the other two criteria of hypoglycemia are also satisfied, a search for the cause is in order. In hospitalized patients, excessive doses of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, the effect of drugs, or chronic renal failure are the most common causes of hypoglycemia. If these factors are absent, another chronic illness known to cause hypoglycemia may be the source. If the cause is still obscure, a thorough evaluation of the endocrine status is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a general two-step method for obtaining peptide fragments for sequence analysis from picomole quantities of proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. After separation by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins are electrophoretically transferred (electroblotted) onto nitrocellulose, the protein-containing regions are detected by reversible staining and are cut out, and each protein is digested in situ by proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin or staphylococcal V-8 protease. The resulting peptide fragments are separated by narrow-bore reverse-phase HPLC, collected, and sequenced in a gas-phase sequenator. Excellent peptide recoveries and the absence of extraneous contaminants in the separation of the peptide fragment mixture allow the generation of extensive internal sequence information from picomole amounts of protein. The method thus overcomes the problem of obtaining amino acid sequence data from N-terminally blocked proteins and provides multiple, independent stretches of sequence that can be used to generate oligonucleotide probes for molecular cloning and/or used to search sequence data bases for related proteins. This method has been successfully applied to the routine amino acid sequence analysis of a wide range of proteins isolated from one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels.\r"

X-ray diffraction data to 1.8-A resolution have been collected on the complex, which has been subjected to restrained least-squares refinement to an R-factor (R equals the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes divided by the sum of the observed structure factor amplitudes) of 14.7%. The inhibitor lies within the major groove of the enzyme and is clearly defined with the exception of the amino-terminal D-histidine and the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine. The reduced peptide bond is located in the active site with close contacts to the two catalytic aspartyl groups. The active-site water molecule that is held between the two carboxyl groups is displaced by the inhibitor, as are a number of other water molecules seen in the binding groove of the native enzyme. A mechanism of action for this class of enzymes is proposed from these results.\r"

By comparing the DNA-protein complexes formed with extracts from cells representing earlier stages of B-cell development with those from plasmacytomas, we identified a plasmacytoma-specific protein that binds to a region within the c-myc promoter. Five other regions of this promoter show extensive sequence-specific binding, but the binding is not clearly B-cell stage-specific. Methylation-interference and o-phenanthroline/copper-protection experiments identified a single plasmacytoma-specific protein binding site 290 base pairs 5' of the transcription start site P1. Homologues of a core sequence, d(AGAAAGGGAAAGGA), within the 25-base-pair binding site are found at three additional sites in the murine c-myc locus. The plasmacytoma-specific occurrence of this protein suggests that it may play a role in the transcriptional repression of the normal c-myc gene observed in plasmacytomas.\r"

One of these cofactors, called \"Z,\" transfers electrons from the site of water oxidation to the reaction center of photosystem II. The other species, \"D,\" has an uncertain function but gives rise to the stable EPR signal known as signal II. Z+. and D+. have identical EPR spectra and are generally assumed to arise from species with the same chemical structure. Results from a variety of experiments have suggested that Z and D are plastoquinones or plastoquinone derivatives. In general, however, the evidence to support this assignment is indirect. To address this situation, we have developed more direct methods to assign the structure of the Z+./D+. radicals. By selective in vivo deuteration of the methyl groups of plastoquinone in cyanobacteria, we show that hyperfine couplings from the methyl protons cannot be responsible for the partially resolved structure seen in the D+. EPR spectrum. That is, we verify by extraction and mass spectrometry that quinones are labeled in algae fed deuterated methionine, but no change is observed in the line shape of signal II. Considering the spectral properties of the D+. radical, a tyrosine origin is a reasonable alternative. In a second series of experiments, we have found that deuteration of tyrosine does indeed narrow the D+. signal. Extraction and mass spectral analysis of the quinones in these cultures show that they are not labeled by tyrosine. These results eliminate a plastoquinone origin for D+.; we conclude instead that D+., and most likely Z+., are tyrosine radicals.\r"

The 634 amino acid sequence is rich in lysine and histidine and contains three distinct, tandemly repeated domains. Indirect immunofluorescence, using affinity-purified monospecific antibodies directed against recombinant protein synthesized in Escherichia coli, localized the knob-associated histidine-rich protein to the membrane of knobby infected erythrocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy established that the protein is clustered on the cytoplasmic side of the erythrocyte membrane and is associated with the electron-dense knobs. A role for this histidine-rich protein in knob structure and cytoadherence is suggested based upon these data.\r"

The data suggest that (i) new periseptal annuli are generated from annuli already in position at the midpoint of the newborn cell; (ii) the nascent annuli are then displaced laterally during cell elongation to positions at 1/4 and 3/4 cell length; and (iii) the annuli at 1/4 and 3/4 cell length are retained during division, becoming the midpoint annuli of the newborn cells at the sites of the forthcoming division septum. The results indicate that the sites of future divisions can be identified and committed to the division process prior to the division cycle in which these sites are utilized for septum formation, and they suggest a model in which preexisting sites of cell division generate future division sites by a replication/displacement mechanism.\r"

The mutations relieve the restraint normally imposed on plasmid copy number by a cloned CEN sequence. Our CEN plasmids specify resistance to G418 and are high copy plasmids only when the mutant host cells are grown on medium containing this antibiotic. The high copy number of the plasmids is independent of the specific cloned CEN sequence and recovered plasmids show no alteration in structure or function of the CEN DNA. The efficiency with which CEN plasmids go to high copy number is increased if the mutant cell is cotransformed by another CEN plasmid. The genomic mutation responsible for the high copy number (COP) is dominant and stable, and it segregates in a Mendelian manner. Homozygous COP/COP a/alpha diploids do not tolerate CEN plasmids at high copy number, suggesting that the mutation is regulated by mating type. The genomic DNA from both mutant cells contains an altered transposon (Ty) restriction fragment that cosegregates with the COP phenotype in crosses of mutant and wild-type strains. The mutations may be transposon-mediated events that identify a gene involved in centromere or mitotic spindle function.\r"

Transposon mutagenesis was used to obtain isogenic strains of a GBS serotype III clinical isolate (COH 31r/s) with site-specific mutations in the gene(s) responsible for capsule production. The self-conjugative transposon Tn916 was transferred to strain COH 31r/s during incubation with Streptococcus faecalis strain CG110 on membrane filters. Eleven transconjugant clones did not bind type III GBS antiserum by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence, competitive ELISA, and electron microscopy confirmed the absence of detectable GBS type III capsular polysaccharide in one of the transconjugants, COH 31-15. Southern hybridization analysis with a Tn916 probe confirmed the presence of the transposon sequence within each mutant. A 3.0-kilobase EcoRI fragment that flanked the Tn916 sequence was subcloned from mutant COH 31-15. This fragment shared homology with DNA from the other GBS serotypes, suggesting a common sequence for capsulation shared by organisms of different capsular types. Loss of capsule expression resulted in loss of virulence in a neonatal rat model. We conclude that a gene common to all capsular types of GBS is required for surface expression of the type III capsule and that inactivation of this gene by Tn916 results in the loss of virulence.\r"

  ".W": "Three mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which define a highly restricted antigen, were obtained by simultaneous immunizations with superficial papillary bladder tumor cells and mouse polyclonal serum against normal urothelium. The antigen was detected by the avidin/biotin/peroxidase method in 30/44 superficial bladder tumors (68%) but in only 4/27 infiltrating urothelial cancers (with much less intensity). No normal adult or fetal tissues tested expressed the antigen, including normal urothelium from 40 individuals, 13 of whom had a bladder tumor positive for the antigen. Only 1 of 45 nonbladder tumors showed some reactivity with one of the three mAbs. Serological tests on a large panel of human cancer cell lines and normal cultured cells were negative. The antigen is highly stable and well preserved on paraffin-embedded tissues. Electrophoretic transfer blot experiments with fresh tumor extracts showed that all three mAbs react with a determinant on a component of 300,000 Mr (pI 9.5) and 62,000 Mr (pI 6.5). The antigen shows polymorphic expression at the cellular level on tissue sections and also at a molecular level on immunoblots where the two bands are differentially detected on extracts of a series of tumors but are not visualized on normal urothelium extracts. The characteristics of this antigenic system suggest that it may provide some insights about the biology of bladder cancer. Specific detection of the antigen on 70% of superficial bladder tumors with normal cytology may be useful for their diagnosis and follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "One of the oldest and most preserved of the homeostatic responses of the body to injury is the acute phase protein response associated with inflammation. The liver responds to hormone-like mediators by the increased synthesis of a series of plasma proteins called acute phase reactants. In these studies, we examined the relationship of hepatocyte-stimulating factor derived from peripheral blood monocytes to interferon beta 2 (IFN-beta 2), which has been cloned. Antibodies raised against fibroblast-derived IFN-beta having neutralizing activity against both IFN-beta 1 and -beta 2 inhibited the major hepatocyte-stimulating activity derived from monocytes. Fibroblast-derived mediator elicited the identical stimulated response in human HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes as the monocyte cytokine. Finally, recombinant-derived human B-cell stimulatory factor type 2 (IFN-beta 2) from Escherichia coli induced the synthesis of all major acute phase proteins studied in human hepatoma HepG2 and primary rat hepatocyte cultures. These data demonstrate that monocyte-derived hepatocyte-stimulating factor and IFN-beta 2 share immunological and functional identity and that IFN-beta 2, also known as B-cell stimulatory factor and hybridoma plasmacytoma growth factor, has the hepatocyte as a major physiologic target and thereby is essential in controlling the hepatic acute phase response.\r"

After an initial equilibration period (-20 to 0 min) with a basal glucose concentration (3.3 mM), the pancreata were perfused with either 16.7 mM glucose (0-40 min) or with 20 mM arginine (0-20 min). Pancreastatin was introduced 10 min prior to and throughout the administration of the high glucose and arginine and continued during their perfusion. As expected, the glucose and the arginine augmented insulin and somatostatin release. Pancreastatin (1 and 10 nM) markedly suppressed the first phase of insulin release with both insulinogogues used, while the early somatostatin secretion was not significantly decreased. However, the peak incremental somatostatin response to arginine was reduced by 50% (P less than 0.05). Conversely, the peptide (10 nM) tended to augment arginine-induced glucagon release. Pancreastatin (100 nM) also suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin release from isolated rat islets. These pancreastatin-mediated alterations in islet hormone release are reminiscent of those known to characterize non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Therefore, the significance of pancreastatin in islet physiology and pathophysiology deserves special consideration.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of a long-acting delivery system for the agonist [D-Trp6]luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ([D-Trp6]LH-RH) with modern somatostatin analogs was studied in the Dunning R-3327H rat prostate cancer model. Microcapsules of [D-Trp6]LH-RH releasing 25 micrograms/day were injected once a month. In the first experiment the adjunct was the somatostatin analog D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2 (RC-121), administered at a dose of 2.5 micrograms twice a day, and the therapy was continued for 70 days. Tumor volume was significantly decreased by [D-Trp6]LH-RH microcapsules or RC-121 given alone. The combination of microcapsules and analog RC-121 caused a greater inhibition of tumor growth than the single agents. Similar effects were seen when the percent increase in the tumor volume was examined. The inhibition of tumor growth caused by the [D-Trp6]LH-RH microcapsules was greater than that caused by RC-121. The combination of the two agents was again the most effective, resulting in the smallest increase in tumor volume. Tumor weights were much lower in the groups treated with microcapsules or RC-121 alone than in controls. The lowest tumor weights were obtained in the group that received the combination of [D-Trp6]LH-RH microcapsules and RC-121. Similar results were obtained in the second experiment, in which the animals were treated for a period of 83 days with microcapsules containing the somatostatin analog D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2 (RC-160) that released 5 micrograms/day and were injected twice a month alone or in combination with microcapsules of [D-Trp6]LH-RH. Microcapsules of analog RC-160 given alone significantly decreased tumor growth as measured by the final tumor volume, the percentage change from the initial tumor volume, and the reduction in tumor weight. The inhibition of tumor growth induced by [D-Trp6]LH-RH microcapsules was greater than that caused by RC-160. The most striking decrease in tumor weight and volume was obtained in animals treated with microcapsules of [D-Trp6]LH-RH combined with the delayed delivery system for RC-160. The overall response to the combination therapy could reflect the inhibition by somatostatin analogs of the proliferation of prostate cancer cells through a decrease in growth hormone and prolactin release and interference with endogenous growth factors, in addition to the main effect, which is the suppression by [D-Trp6]LH-RH of the growth of androgen-dependent tumor cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The functional significance of the portal vascular link between the beta cells of the pancreatic islets and the liver has not been established. Previous studies indicated that insulin does not acutely regulate glucose metabolism by a direct hepatic effect. More recent observations suggest that the role of insulin in regulating body growth may be mediated, at least in part, by the liver. Our experiments were designed to test whether insulin can promote body growth and regulate glucose metabolism by a direct hepatic action in vivo. Rats were made diabetic by injections of streptozotocin, and insulin or solvent was infused into the jugular vein (JV) or the hepatic portal vein (HPV) for 14 days using catheters that were attached to osmotic minipumps. Infusion of a low dose of insulin (2 units per kg per day) into the JV had no effects on the hyperglycemia, body weight gain, tail growth, tibial epiphysial cartilage plate thickness, or serum levels of somatomedin C in the diabetic rats. However, the same dose given into the HPV caused a 30% reduction of blood glucose and stimulated a significant degree of growth, as determined by all indices. Infusion of a higher dose of insulin (5 units per kg per day) into either vein caused full restoration of body weight gain and tail growth and it restored the glycemic status almost to normal. However, it did not increase the tibial epiphysial plate width or serum somatomedin C levels above those of the rats given the low dose of the hormone into the HPV. These results indicate that insulin can act directly on the liver to promote body growth and to regulate glucose metabolism. The significance of direct delivery of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells to the liver may be as much for growth control as for glucose homeostasis.\r"

  ".U": "88041097\r", 
  ".W": "The malaria parasite has an obligate calcium requirement for normal intracellular growth and invasion of host erythrocytes. Calmodulin (CaM) is a vital calcium-dependent protein present in eukaryotes. We found by radioimmunoassay that free parasites contain CaM. Schizont-infected erythrocytes had CaM levels of 23.3 +/- 2.7 ng per 10(6) cells compared to normals (11.2 +/- 1.5 ng per 10(6) cells). CaM levels were proportional to parasite maturity. Immunoelectron microscopy identified CaM diffusely within the cytoplasm of mature parasites and at the apical end of merozoites within the ductule of rhoptries, which may explain the calcium requirement for invasion. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was also found by electron microscopic autoradiography to concentrate in the food vacuole, as do chloroquine and mefloquine, and to distribute within the cytoplasm of mature parasites. The binding of dansylated CsA to schizont-infected erythrocytes was higher than to normal erythrocytes as analyzed by flow cytometry. Kinetic analysis revealed that binding was saturable for normal and infected erythrocytes and possibly free parasites. Competition for binding existed between dansylated CsA and native CsA as well as the CaM inhibitor W-7 and the classic antimalarial chloroquine. The in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum was sensitive to CaM antagonists, and in large part inhibition of the parasite was proportional to known anti-CaM potency. Antagonism existed between combinations of these drugs in multi-drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum, suggesting possible competition for the same binding site. In addition, the malaria parasite was also susceptible to calcium antagonists.\r"

High-level expression of antisense MYC RNA was obtained by selecting cells resistant to progressively higher levels of mycophenolic acid over a period of greater than 6 months. The constitutive production of MYC protein in clones producing high levels of antisense MYC RNA was reduced by 70% compared to parental HL-60 cells. Inhibition of MYC expression was observed not only at the translational but also at the transcriptional level, implying that antisense RNA can regulate transcription of the MYC gene. The Pst I-Pvu II fragment (920 base pairs) of the MYC leader sequence is the primary transcriptional target of the antisense RNA. The suppression of endogenous MYC gene expression by antisense RNA decreases cell proliferation and triggers monocytic differentiation.\r"

Phagocytosis of diamide-treated erythrocytes required that the cells were opsonized with whole serum, since complement inactivation abolished phagocytosis. Opsonization with whole serum containing 20-100 times the physiological concentration of naturally occurring anti-band-3 antibodies enhanced phagocytosis of diamide-treated erythrocytes. High inputs of anti-band-3 also restored phagocytosis of erythrocytes that had been incubated with complement-inactivated serum. Elevated concentrations of anti-spectrin antibodies were ineffective in whole and complement-inactivated serum. Specific recognition of diamide-treated erythrocytes by anti-band-3 antibodies may be due to generation of anti-band-3 reactive protein oligomers on intact diamide-treated erythrocytes. Generation of such oligomers was dose-dependent with respect to diamide. Bound anti-band-3 alone was not sufficient to mediate phagocytosis. It resulted in deposition of complement component C3b on the cells through activation of the alternative complement pathway in amounts exceeding that of bound antibodies by two orders of magnitude. Thus, anti-band-3 and complement together mediate phagocytosis of oxidatively stressed erythrocytes, which stimulate senescent erythrocytes with respect to bound antibody and complement.\r"

We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the OXA-1 beta-lactamase gene and flanking sequences. The OXA-1 gene shows a greater than 50% sequence divergence from the OXA-2 gene, yet there is significant functional similarity at the peptide level. Analysis of 5' and 3' flanking sequences shows that Tn2603 differs from its probable precursor, Tn21, by a precise 1004-base-pair insertion, containing the OXA-1 structural gene, at the target sequence AAAGTT, which is located between the Tn21 streptomycin/spectinomycin (aadA) promoter and its structural gene. A 5- for 6-base repeat of the target sequence is found at the end of the insertion. The same precise insertion and repeat of the target sequence are found for the OXA-2 gene from R46. The 5' flanking regions of two other genes, the trimethoprim-resistance gene from R388 and the gentamicin resistance (aadB) gene from pDGO100, are greater than 98% homologous to the 5' flanking sequences of the OXA-1, OXA-2, and aadA genes until they diverge at the target sequence. From the available sequence data a recombinational hot spot is defined at the nucleotide level 5' of the aadA gene of Tn21, and a second potential hot spot is proposed 3' of this gene.\r"

We have examined the effect of the secY24 (temperature-sensitive) mutation on the protein translocation activity of E. coli inverted membrane vesicles. Vesicles isolated from cells carrying this allele and grown at the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C) were less than 1% as active in translocation as vesicles isolated from an isogenic secY+ strain under the same conditions. Vesicles from the mutant strain grown at the permissive temperature (32 degrees C) were partially active, but those vesicles preincubated at 40 degrees C lost 90% of their activity. Moreover, the secY24 translocation defect on in vivo- or in vitro-inactivated vesicles was suppressed, or compensated, by an S300 soluble fraction from wild-type cells or from secY24 cells grown at nonpermissive temperature. The suppressing factor(s) was heat-labile and sensitive to proteinase K. These results provide biochemical evidence for the essential role of SecY in the translocation process and indicate that the translocation defect of SecY24 membranes can be compensated for by supplementing with additional soluble cytoplasmic proteins.\r"

In the presence of a minimal level of insulin (1 ng/ml), ChoAcT activity increased with time in culture. A correspondence between the insulin concentration in the defined medium (1-100 ng/ml) and both the rate of increase and maximum attained level of ChoAcT activity was observed. Maximal ChoAcT activity was 2- to 3-fold greater in cells cultured in the presence of 100 ng of insulin per ml than in cells cultured in the presence of 1 ng of insulin per ml. To elicit maximum ChoAcT activity, insulin at 100 ng/ml was required in the medium for only the first 4 days of the culture period, at which time insulin could be reduced to maintenance levels (10 ng/ml) without affecting ChoAcT activity. Insulin binding assays performed during a 7-day culture period revealed that irrespective of the insulin concentration in the medium during culture, cell-surface insulin receptors decreased by approximately 90% between 4 and 7 days in culture. This decrease in insulin binding corresponded to the observed decrease in the sensitivity of ChoAcT activity to insulin. Our findings suggest that insulin plays a role in mediating cholinergic differentiation in the embryonic chicken retina.\r"

Flagellar hook-basal body complexes from Salmonella typhimurium were used as the immunogen for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies. An antibody obtained was directed against a major basal-body component, a 65-kDa protein that from mutant studies has been assigned as the product of the flaAII.1 gene. By immunoelectron microscopy, the antibody was observed to bind the innermost feature of the basal body: the cytoplasmic-facing surface of the M ring.

The enzyme from human erythrocytes was covalently labeled at its active site with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and the protein was subsequently reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. The labeled tryptic peptides were purified by gel filtration and repeated reversed-phase HPLC, and their amino-terminal sequences were determined. Residue 9 contained the radioactive label and was, therefore, considered to be the active serine residue. The primary structure of the part of the active site (residues 1-10) containing this residue was concluded to be Xaa-Thr-Gln-Leu-Met-Asx-Gly-Thr-Ser-Met. This amino acid sequence is homologous to the sequence surrounding the active serine of the microbial peptidases subtilisin and thermitase. These data demonstrate that human tripeptidyl peptidase II represents a potentially distinct class of human peptidases and raise the question of an evolutionary relationship between the active site of a mammalian peptidase and that of the subtilisin family of serine peptidases.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinase activity in A431 cells was examined. The incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into PtdIns by A431 membranes was increased in membranes prepared from cells that had been pretreated with EGF. Demonstration of a stimulation of the PtdIns kinase activity by EGF required the use of subconfluent cultures and was dependent on the inclusion of protease inhibitors in the buffers used to prepare the membranes. Stimulation of the PtdIns kinase activity was rapid. The activation peaked 2 min after the addition of EGF and declined slowly thereafter. Half-maximal stimulation of the PtdIns kinase occurred at 7 nM EGF. Kinetic analyses of the reaction indicated that treatment of the cells with EGF resulted in a decrease in the Km for PtdIns with no change in the Vmax. The kinetic parameters for the utilization of ATP were unchanged in the EGF-treated membranes compared to the control membranes. Pretreatment of the cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate blocked the ability of EGF to stimulate PtdIns kinase activity. These findings demonstrate that a PtdIns kinase activity in A431 cells is regulated by EGF and provide a good system for examining the mechanism by which EGF stimulates the activity of this intracellular enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an electric field on the optical absorption (Stark effect) of reaction centers (RCs) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas viridis embedded in films of poly(vinyl alcohol) was measured. The infrared bands were investigated at 295 K and 77 K. In RCs from Rp. viridis at 77 K six peaks (at 982, 849, 835, 818, 803, and 787 nm), associated with the Qy transitions of the six pigments, were resolved; in addition, a small broad band at 865 nm was resolved. In RCs from Rb. sphaeroides only five bands (at 877, 817, 802, 761, and 754 nm) assigned to the Qy transitions were resolved; in addition, two small bands at 697 and 683 nm were observed. The additional bands have been tentatively assigned to vibrational side bands, although the contribution from charge-transfer states cannot be excluded. The Stark spectra had line shapes similar to the second derivative of the absorption spectra and were interpreted in terms of the interaction between the applied electric field and the dipole moments of the ground and excited states. Analyses of the spectra yielded the apparent change in dipole moment delta mu app = f delta mu (where the factor f corrects for the difference between the local field and the applied field) and delta, the angle between delta mu---- and the transition moment mu trans. At 77 K the values of delta mu----app and delta for the peaks at 877, 802, and 761 nm in Rb. sphaeroides were 6.5 debye, 38 degrees; 2.1 debye, 23 degrees; and 3.5 debye, 8 degrees. In Rp. viridis the debye values for the peaks at 982, 835, 818, and 787 were 8.2, 40 degrees; 1.8, 50 degrees; 3.4, 14 degrees; and 2.7, 0 degrees. The large values of delta mu app associated with the long-wavelength peak of the bacteriochlorophyll dimers are consistent with a significant charge-transfer contribution to the excited state of the primary donor.\r"

  ".W": "Using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 414), we previously identified a protein of 62 kDa (p62) that was localized to the nuclear pore complex by immunoelectron microscopy. We also showed that p62 binds specifically to wheat germ agglutinin. Therefore, we proposed that this nuclear pore complex protein might be a member of a recently characterized family of glycoproteins that are labeled by in vitro galactosylation of rat liver nuclei and contain O-linked monosaccharidic GlcNAc residues. In support of this, we now show that incubation with N-acetylglucosaminidase reduces the molecular mass of p62 by approximately 3 kDa because of the removal of terminal GlcNAc residues. Moreover, p62 can be galactosylated in vitro by using UDP-[3H]galactose and galactosyltransferase. We also show that most of the GlcNAc residues are added within 5 min of synthesis, when p62 is soluble and cytosolic. Thus, the addition of GlcNAc is carried out in the cytoplasm and is clearly distinct from the N- and O-linked glycosylation pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Using another mAb with a broad specificity for nuclear GlcNAc-containing proteins, we show by immunofluorescence and protein blotting of subnuclear fractions that some of these proteins are in the interior of the nucleus, and others are most likely located in the pore complex.\r"

The presence of stoichiometric levels of two other purified components in the chemotaxis system, the CheY and CheZ proteins, induces dephosphorylation.

No significant changes were observed in the frequencies of spleen cells bearing class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, surface immunoglobulin, or Thy-1, Ly-1, Ly-2, or L3T4 antigens. However, the densities (per cell) of both class I and class II MHC antigens were increased significantly on cells from aged as compared to young mice, whereas the densities of the other cell surface antigens studied were unchanged or slightly decreased. The increased levels of MHC antigen expression in old relative to young mice were shown to be functionally significant regarding immunological stimulation. These data suggest that T-cell clones silent in young individuals may be activated in comparable situations in older animals, leading to immunological alterations perhaps including increased autoreactivity.\r"

To determine the transplantability of nonhematopoietic marrow stromal cells, stable clonal stromal cell line (GB1/6) expressing the a isoenzyme of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Glu6PI-a, D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase; EC 5.3.1.9) was derived from murine long-term bone marrow cultures and made resistant to neomycin analogue G418 by retroviral gene transfer. GB1/6 cells were fibronectin+, laminin+, and collagen-type IV+ and collagen type I-; these GB1/6 cells supported in vitro growth of hematopoietic stem cells forming colony-forming units of spleen cells (CFU-S) and of granulocytes, erythrocytes, and macrophage/megakarocytes (CFU-GEMM) in the absence of detectable growth factors interleukin 3 (multi-colony-stimulating factor), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-stimulating factor, or their poly(A)+ mRNAs. The GB1/6 cells produced macrophage colony-stimulating factor constitutively. Recipient C57BL/6J (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase b) mice that received 3-Gy total-body irradiation and 13 Gy to the right hind limb were injected i.v. with GB1/6 cells. Engrafted mice demonstrated donor-originating Glu6PI-a+ stromal cells in marrow sinuses in situ 2 mo after transplantation and a significantly enhanced hematopoietic recovery compared with control irradiated nontransplanted mice. Continuous (over numerous passages) marrow cultures derived from transplanted mice demonstrated G418-resistant, Glu6PI-a+ stromal colony-forming cells and greater cumulative production of multipotential stem cells of recipient origin compared with cultures established from irradiated, nontransplanted control mice. These data are evidence for physiological function in vivo of a transplanted bone marrow stromal cell line.\r"

The abnormal tubulofilaments resembled but were distinguished from normal microtubules. On grids soaked in sodium dodecyl sulfate the abnormal tubulofilaments were found in stages of fragmentation, an outer coat appearing t0 strip from the surface to reveal thinner fibrillary structures resembling scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF). The unmasked fibrils were identified as SAF by immunogold labeling, while the larger tubulofilaments were not labeled.

However, certain cell types in liver, pancreas, kidney, colon, and jejunum showed specific localization of P-glycoprotein. In liver, P-glycoprotein was found exclusively on the biliary canalicular front of hepatocytes and on the apical surface of epithelial cells in small biliary ductules. In pancreas, P-glycoprotein was found on the apical surface of the epithelial cells of small ductules but not larger pancreatic ducts. In kidney, P-glycoprotein was found concentrated on the apical surface of epithelial cells of the proximal tubules. Colon and jejunum both showed high levels of P-glycoprotein on the apical surfaces of superficial columnar epithelial cells. Adrenal gland showed high levels of P-glycoprotein diffusely distributed on the surface of cells in both the cortex and medulla.

Binding of 3H-labeled MK-801 was inhibited by phencyclidine, Mg2+, and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid in a manner dependent on the presence of L-glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate, suggesting that it labeled a site linked to the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor. Glycine also regulated 3H-labeled MK-801 binding, enhancing it in the concentration range of 0.01-10 microM. The actions of glutamate and glycine involved increases in binding affinity, without altering the number of 3H-labeled MK-801 binding sites. The effects of glycine in this system were mimicked by L- and D-alanine and L- and D-serine. However, beta-alanine and taurine were much less effective, and strychnine did not block the actions of glycine indicating that they were not mediated by the classical glycine receptors. Glycine also enhanced the ability of N-methyl-D-aspartate to increase Ca2+ influx into primary cultures of mouse striatal neurons measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2. These results support the suggestion that glycine may be an important regulator of the physiological actions of glutamate in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Schwann cells derived from neonatal rat sciatic nerve are quiescent in culture unless treated with specific mitogens. The use of glial growth factor (GGF) and forskolin has been found to be an effective method for stimulating proliferation of Schwann cells on a poly(L-lysine) substratum while maintaining their ability to myelinate axons in vitro. We find that repetitive passaging of Schwann cells with GGF and forskolin results in the loss of normal growth control; the cells are able to proliferate without added mitogens. The immortalized cells grow continuously in the absence of added growth factor and in the presence or absence of serum yet continue to express distinctive Schwann cell-surface antigens. The cells can associate with axons in culture, deposit a basal lamina, and ensheath axons, but they gradually lose their capacity to myelinate axons. The immortalized cells release growth-promoting activity into their culture medium. The released activity is effective in stimulating proliferation of primary Schwann cells that retain normal growth properties. Extracellular matrix molecules (laminin and fibronectin) augment the response of primary Schwann cells to the secreted mitogen. Quiescent primary Schwann cells also secrete a growth factor into their culture medium, but its activity is detectable only in the presence of added laminin or fibronectin. The results suggest that both normal and immortalized Schwann cells secrete an autocrine growth factor. Response to the autocrine factor appears to entail a multicomponent mechanism. Unlike primary cells, immortalized Schwann cells have the capacity to secrete all of the necessary components and to respond to them constitutively.\r"

It is inherited, but the pattern of inheritance is not well defined. Increase in total IgE is one manifestation of atopy, and increase in IgE in early infancy is a predictor of atopic illness, including asthma. Sensitization to allergens and repeated exposure is one of the triggers of developing asthma in atopic patients. Allergy even without asthma (allergic rhinitis) is associated with an increase in bronchial reactivity. Allergy is a risk factor in occupational asthma and in exercise induced asthma. In fact, many non-asthmatic allergic rhinitis patients wheeze with exercise. Allergen avoidance and environmental control may contribute to the well-being of many asthmatics. Allergy hyposensitization (immunotherapy) may help control asthma in allergic patients.\r"

In the pharmacopeia the possibility of an allergic reaction to a drug must be considered in any instance when a patient reports an adverse effect to a drug. Although most allergic reactions to drugs are mild, they may be severe and at times fatal. Thus, it is imperative that every physician understand the spectra of drug allergy, the methods for diagnosing, and the means of treating allergic reactions to drugs. This review places drug allergies within the context of the over-all spectra of adverse reaction to drugs, defines the spectra of allergic reactions in terms of the organ systems involved and the severity of the reactions, suggests mechanisms for diagnosing drug allergy by historical evaluation, and where possible, by skin testing procedures and provocative dose challenges, and provides a variety of methods for reintroduction of drugs to which patients have been demonstrated to be allergic. The most important aspect of allergic reactions to drugs, however, is the understanding on the part of the physician that any drug has the potential for causing an allergic reaction and that extreme vigilance in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of these reactions is necessary.\r"

Verification, however, depends on documentation of disappearance of symptoms after avoidance of the offending food and their recurrence on reintroduction of that food. Treatment is mainly dietary avoidance. Its success, however, depends on many factors. Pharmacologic agents may be needed in some cases for symptomatic relief and possibly for prophylaxis.

Increased frequency of injections seems to stimulate production of blocking antibody. Much work is currently under way to provide modified forms of immunotherapy designed to elicit the immune response without the allergic or adverse reactions of the allergen. Polymerized antigens, allergoids and glutaraldehyde-treated tyrosine-absorbed allergens are examples of such modifications. It is quite possible that within a short time extracts will be available commercially such that a patient will be adequately immunized with only a very few injections. Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy offers virtually complete protection for those patients who in the past were at great risk from stings. Proper history, skin testing, extract prescribing, and extract administration all are vital points in the successful immunotherapy of a patient.\r"

We also investigated the relationship between the development of neoplastic lesions and the duration of immunosuppression, previous sun exposure and infection with human papilloma virus. The overall prevalence of neoplastic and pre-neoplastic epidermal lesions in the group was 25 per cent, higher than that previously reported in studies from the United Kingdom. In patients who had survived for more than 80 months after transplantation the prevalence of these lesions was 38 per cent. There was no apparent relationship between sun exposure or skin type and the development of cutaneous neoplasia, despite the fact that the majority of lesions were found on sun-exposed sites. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is probably important as an initiator or co-factor rather than as a precipitant. In both sexes, high sun exposure was associated with the presence of viral warts. In females, there was a strong association between the presence of viral warts and the occurrence of neoplastic lesions elsewhere, giving support to the hypothesis that ultraviolet radiation may be acting as a co-factor in virally-mediated oncogenesis. Epidermal cell kinetic studies in 39 patients using in-vitro exposure to 3H thymidine and autoradiographic techniques showed no difference between the patients with neoplastic lesions and unaffected patients, and is not therefore a useful method of identifying an 'at risk' group.\r"

Neural and pharmacologic activation of alpha-adrenergic pathways can reduce coronary blood flow and the cross-sectional area of large coronary arteries, despite concomitant increases in coronary distending pressure. Activation of either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors can induce potent dilation of both coronary resistance vessels and large coronary arteries, whereas blockade of these receptors can elicit profound constriction in the presence of elevated beta-adrenergic tone. The regulation of the coronary circulation by parasympathetic mechanism remains the most controversial, likely because of major species differences. Parasympathetic coronary dilation is uniformly observed in the dog, but in primates, important aspects of parasympathetic-mediated coronary vasoconstriction have also been demonstrated.\r"

Whereas patients in the last group showed the expected 1.5-fold increase in dosage of this gene, none of the patients with AD had a gene dosage higher than that of the normal controls. These results do not support the hypothesis that the genetic defect in AD involves duplication of a segment of chromosome 21 containing the amyloid gene. Alternative mechanisms for the brain-specific increase in amyloid protein deposition in AD should be considered.\r"

Inhibition of methylation in vivo was found for the stable inserts with the longest left-handed (presumably Z) helices. In vitro methylation with the purified MEco RI agreed with the results in vivo. Supercoil-induced changes in the structure of the primary helix in vitro provided confirmation that left-handed helices were responsible for this behavior.

The parent promonocyte cell line U937 was chronically infected with HIV-1 and from this line a clone, U1, was derived. U1 showed minimal constitutive expression of HIV-1, but virus expression was markedly up-regulated by a phytohemagglutinin-induced supernatant containing multiple cytokines and by recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not up-regulate virus expression. Concomitant with the cytokine-induced up-regulation of HIV-1, expression of membrane-bound IL-1 beta was selectively induced in U1 in the absence of induction of other surface membrane proteins. This cytokine up-regulation of IL-1 beta was not seen in the uninfected parent U937 cell line. These studies have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of progression from a latent or low-level HIV-1 infection to a productive infection with resulting immunosuppression. In addition, this model can be used to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby HIV-1 infection regulates cellular gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The T antigen specified by SV40 virus is the only viral-encoded protein required for replication of SV40 DNA. T antigen has two activities that appear to be essential for viral DNA replication: specific binding to duplex DNA at the origin of replication and helicase activity that unwinds the two DNA strands. As judged by electron microscopy, DNA unwinding is initiated at the origin of replication and proceeds bidirectionally. Either linear or circular DNA molecules containing the origin of replication are effective substrates; with closed circular DNA, a topoisomerase capable of removing positive superhelical turns is required for an efficient reaction. Presence of an origin sequence on duplex DNA and a single-strand DNA-binding protein appear to be the only requirements for T antigen to catalyze unwinding. This reaction mediated by T antigen defines a likely pathway to precise initiation of DNA replication: (i) the sequence-specific binding activity locates the origin sequence, (ii) the duplex DNA is unwound at this site, and (iii) the DNA polymerase and primase begin DNA replication. A similar pathway has been inferred for the localized initiation of DNA replication by bacteriophage lambda and by Escherichia coli in which a sequence-specific binding protein locates the origin and directs the DnaB helicase to this site. Observations with the SV40 system indicate that localized initiation of duplex DNA replication may be similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\r"

An increase of serum gastrin levels was demonstrated postoperatively in all patients, irrespective of sex, length of history, acid secretion data or recurrence. At several years postoperatively, a highly significant secondary rise in serum gastrin levels was observed, which corresponded well to recent physiologic and morphologic data. The most suitable explanation appeared to be that the proximal gastric vagotomy (vagotomy of the fundus and corpus) abolished the vagally mediated inhibition of the G-cells in the antrum (disinhibition of the oxyntopyloric reflex). The serum gastrin values were always higher and the secondary postoperative increase was earlier for patients who had taken cimetidine preoperatively. Contrary to traditional expectations, no correlation at all was found between serum gastrin levels and acid secretion data. Recurrence could not be predicted on the basis of serum gastrin levels.\r"

If complications, such as leakage and abscess have occurred, this drain is extremely effective to ensure drainage and suction or irrigation, or both, as the Penrose drain can be replaced with sump tube drain. This simple hybrid for double lumen drain has proved to be both efficient and safe.\r"

  ".U": "88043130\r", 
  ".W": "Recurrent thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, or sudden death may develop in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia who are reexposed to heparin. Three patients came to us in whom a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia had been made on the basis of clinical and serologic evidence; these patients required reexposure to heparin because of urgent cardiac surgery. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of iloprost (ZK36374), a new analogue of prostacyclin, to prevent heparin-dependent activation of platelets and thereby permit obligatory heparinization for safe extracorporeal circulation. Before operation, we demonstrated that iloprost prevented both heparin-dependent platelet aggregation and tritiated (3H)-serotonin release in vitro. Therefore a continuous infusion of iloprost was begun 1 hour before heparinization and was continued throughout cardiopulmonary bypass and for an additional 15 minutes after protamine administration. The mean platelet count of 130,000/microliters before operation remained stable, and no spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed in samples of platelet-rich plasma obtained before cardiopulmonary bypass but after heparin administration. Similarly, after heparin administration but before bypass, platelet responsiveness to adenosine diphosphate remained unchanged when compared with preoperative values. Plasma levels of platelet factor 4 increased from 26 +/- 1 ng/ml (mean +/- standard error) to 843 +/- 383 ng/ml after heparin administration but actually decreased throughout cardiopulmonary bypass to 52 +/- 25 ng/ml. Beta-thromboglobulin levels increased from 103 +/- 16 to 244 +/- 94 ng/ml with heparinization. The mean bleeding time was 10.5 minutes preoperatively and 13.3 minutes postoperatively. The mean amount of postoperative chest tube drainage (duration: 12 hours) was 432 +/- 67 ml. Thus, despite the confirmed presence of heparin-dependent platelet-activating factor in the plasma of these three patients, iloprost prevented heparin-induced platelet activation during cardiopulmonary bypass while preserving platelet function, as would be desired for postoperative hemostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Graded high-compression support hosiery have long been recognized as a physiologically significant mode of therapy for chronic venous disease because of their effects on the hemodynamics of venous return. Photoplethysmography (PPG) in the noninvasive vascular laboratory is now recognized as a quick, simple, and noninvasive measurement technique, which correlates well with ambulatory venous pressure in the postphlebitic limb with chronic venous insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects, as measured by PPG, of 40 mm Hg graded compression support hosiery in the treatment of patients with a documented history of hospital-treated thrombophlebitis. Fifty lower extremities among 38 patients with a documented history of deep vein thrombosis and chronic venous insufficiency were matched against 50 control extremities among patients without disease. All 50 lower extremities in the study group had abnormal noninvasive venous studies, including Doppler ultrasound examination, phleborheography, and PPG (mean, 5.9. seconds). Thus these patients were ascertained to have incompetent deep venous systems, but with normal arterial flow as documented by ankle:brachial ratios. After application of 40 mm Hg gradient compression stockings to the study group, PPG measurements in all 50 limbs initially converted to normal (20.6 seconds). Abnormal PPG measurements were converted to normal in postphlebitic limbs with the application of graded compression stockings in the 29 patients who wore the prescribed hosiery; 21 patients did not wear the gradient stockings after the initial evaluation(s) and were not found to have improved PPG measurements. It can be concluded that such gradient stockings should be associated with a reduction in ambulatory venous pressure, which may, in turn, lead to clinical prevention or improvement of the various sequelae associated with chronic venous hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether pretreatment of the donor rat with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) would protect against hepatic ischemia induced for 30 minutes at normothermic body temperature. Fresh liver transplants were used as controls (minus warm ischemia of 30 minutes) and gave a 1-week survival rate of 84.6%. CoQ10 was administered intravenously (10 mg/kg body weight) to the donor rat 1 hour before induction of warm ischemia (group A). In another group (B), the same dose was given intravenously not only to the donor rat but also to the recipient rat 1 hour before grafting. None of the placebo group survived more than 2 days. The 1-week survival rates of the groups pretreated with CoQ10 were 45.5% for group A and 50% for group B. There was no significant difference between groups A and B. A statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the placebo group and both CoQ10-treated groups (p less than 0.05). It was therefore assumed that CoQ10, accumulated in the donor liver, was a primary factor in improving survival. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), total bilirubin, and total protein were measured by means of light and electron microscopic examination of the liver 6 months after transplantation. Long-term-surviving rats with transplanted, ischemically damaged liver that was pretreated with CoQ10 showed a decrease in the activity of SGOT and SGPT and an increase in levels of total protein to the normal range (as well as to those levels exhibited by fresh-liver-transplanted rats) with practically no change in levels of SALP, total bilirubin, or in histologic findings. These results indicate that donor pretreatment with CoQ10 is useful for increasing survival after warm ischemic damage of rat liver grafts.\r"

The purity of the final preparations was 60% to 90% islets, making it possible to culture the islet preparations in vitro. Perifusion of the islet preparations after 1, 3, or 7 days of culture at 24 degrees C indicated that the islets were viable and would respond to glucose stimulation. If the islets were returned to 37 degrees C culture for 1 day, then the insulin secretory response at 7 days was comparable with the response during the first day of culture at 37 degrees C. Extending the culture period at 24 degrees C to 14 days damaged the islets as indicated by the lack of response to glucose stimulation. The Ficoll technique was a much more effective method for purifying the islets, since it provided approximately twice the yield of islets and insulin compared with the Percoll procedure. The mean yield of purified islets by the Ficoll technique was 2180 +/- 325 islets/gm of pancreas with a calculated islet mass of 3.7 +/- 0.8 mm3/gm. The findings that massive numbers of purified human islets can be obtained by centrifugation on Ficoll gradients and that the purified islet preparations remain morphologically and functionally intact during 7 days' culture at 24 degrees C make it possible to assess the function of donor islets before human islet transplantation, transplant the islets via the portal vein, and use low-temperature culture as a possible approach for altering the immunogenicity of donor human islets.\r"
