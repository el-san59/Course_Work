  ".W": "Although a substantial literature confirms the abnormal flow properties of diabetic blood, only in a few papers has the vasculitis of diabetic neuropathy been considered to have a hemorheological cause. It is proposed that the pathogenesis of nerve lesions involves an interaction between the specialized nerve vascular system and focal ischemic lesions resulting from rheologically induced stasis. The proposition is extended into other conditions with abnormal blood rheology such as hypothyroidism, uremia, dysglobulinemia, polyarteritis nodosa, and lepromatous leprosy. It is concluded that the treatment of such polyneuropathies should include an agent which would improve the flow properties of the blood.\r"

In myopathic subjects the isometric contraction caused an increase of the total power, a progressive increase of power of the lower frequencies, a decrease of that of the higher frequencies, and a shift downward of the median frequency. In normal children an increase of the total power without a significant median frequency shift was noted. The modifications observed in DMD children were explained by a decrement of the firing rate of the more damaged fast twitch motor units. This decrease was probably induced by a relative predominance of activity of the slow twitch motor units, which are less damaged by the pathological process.\r"

  ".U": "88302297\r", 
  ".W": "Because most colorectal carcinomas appear to arise from adenomas, studies of different stages of colorectal neoplasia may shed light on the genetic alterations involved in tumor progression. We looked for four genetic alterations (ras-gene mutations and allelic deletions of chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) in 172 colorectal-tumor specimens representing various stages of neoplastic development. The specimens consisted of 40 predominantly early-stage adenomas from 7 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, 40 adenomas (19 without associated foci of carcinoma and 21 with such foci) from 33 patients without familial polyposis, and 92 carcinomas resected from 89 patients. We found that ras-gene mutations occurred in 58 percent of adenomas larger than 1 cm and in 47 percent of carcinomas. However, ras mutations were found in only 9 percent of adenomas under 1 cm in size. Sequences on chromosome 5 that are linked to the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis were not lost in adenomas from the patients with polyposis but were lost in 29 to 35 percent of adenomas and carcinomas, respectively, from other patients. A specific region of chromosome 18 was deleted frequently in carcinomas (73 percent) and in advanced adenomas (47 percent) but only occasionally in earlier-stage adenomas (11 to 13 percent). Chromosome 17p sequences were usually lost only in carcinomas (75 percent). The four molecular alterations accumulated in a fashion that paralleled the clinical progression of tumors. These results are consistent with a model of colorectal tumorigenesis in which the steps required for the development of cancer often involve the mutational activation of an oncogene coupled with the loss of several genes that normally suppress tumorigenesis.\r"

Whereas antibodies have both soluble and membrane forms that can bind to antigens alone, T-cell receptors exist only on cell surfaces and recognize antigen fragments only when they are embedded in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Patterns of diversity in T-cell receptor genes together with structural features of immunoglobulin and MHC molecules suggest a model for how this recognition might occur. This view of T-cell recognition has implications for how the receptors might be selected in the thymus and how they (and immunoglobulins) may have arisen during evolution.\r"

  ".W": "A common early response of eukaryotic cells to stimuli which activate their proliferation is an increase in intracellular pH (ref. 1). In animal cells this is caused by the activation of an Na+/H+ exchange system; in fungi and plants an H+-pumping ATPase is involved. The critical question is whether this intracellular alkalinization is merely coincident with the activation of cell proliferation or whether it is a regulatory signal. To increase intracellular pH bypassing the usual physiological stimuli (growth factors, hormones etc.) alkaline media or ammonia have been used in the past. Both approaches suffer from long-term toxicity effects and cannot be used in tumorigenic assays with whole organisms. We introduce here a more specific approach which involves expressing the gene for the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase in fibroblasts. The resulting cells have an elevated intracellular pH and acquire tumorigenic properties, suggesting that the yeast ATPase gene behaves as an oncogene in mammalian cells. These experiments support a crucial role of intracellular pH in the growth control of animal cells.\r"

  ".W": "DNA in the cell is intertwined at several levels: one polynucleotide strand wraps helically around its complement and the double helix is in turn coiled in space. The higher-order intertwining most often takes the form of supercoiling of the helix axis, but can also be observed as the wrapping of one DNA duplex around another, as in catenation. We have investigated the relationship between intertwining at these three levels, the double helix, supercoiling, and catenation, using an approach that relies on comparative measurements of DNA linking numbers by gel electrophoresis. The method determines both the handedness of DNA catenanes and the change in helical repeat that accompanies catenation-induced supercoiling. For multiply-linked catenated rings of 3.5 kilobase pairs (kb), we conclude that the double helix unwinds by two-thirds of a turn for every right-handed supercoil involved in linking the two circles. Altering the geometry of the catenanes by linking rings of dissimilar size changes the effect of catenation on helical and superhelical parameters. Our experiments used intact DNA rings, but we note that linear DNA molecules, by virtue of their subdivision into closed loops or domains in vivo, can intertwine in the same ways.\r"

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, U2 RNA interacts with the intron by RNA-RNA pairing between the conserved branchpoint sequence UACUAAC and conserved nucleotides near the 5' end of U2 (ref. 4). Metazoan U2 RNA is less than 200 nucleotides in length, but yeast U2 RNA is 1,175 nucleotides long. The 5' 110 nucleotides of yeast U2 are homologous to the 5' 100 nucleotides of metazoan U2 (ref. 6), and the very 3' end of yeast U2 bears a weak structural resemblance to features near the 3' end of metazoan U2. Internal sequences of yeast U2 share primary sequence homology with metazoan U4, U5 and U6 small nuclear RNA (ref. 6), and have regions of complementarity with yeast U1 (ref. 7). We have investigated the importance of the internal U2 sequences by their deletion. Yeast cells carrying a U2 allele lacking 958 nucleotides of internal U2 sequence produce a U2 small nuclear RNA similar in size to that found in other organisms. Cells carrying only the U2 deletion grow normally, have normal levels of spliced mRNA and do not accumulate unspliced precursor mRNA. We conclude that the internal sequences of yeast U2 carry no essential function. The extra RNA may have a non-essential function in efficient ribonucleoprotein assembly or RNA stability. Variation in amount of RNA in homologous structural RNAs has precedence in ribosomal RNA and RNaseP.\r"

P. carinii is a eukaryotic microorganism of uncertain taxonomy that can infect numerous mammalian hosts. Developing from a small, unicellular 'trophozoite' into a 'cyst' containing eight 'sporozoites', its life cycle superficially resembles those seen both in the Protozoa and Fungi. Morphological and ultrastructural observations have lead some investigators to conclude that the organism is a protozoan, while others have felt that it more closely resembles a fungus. Phylogenetic relationships can be inferred from comparisons of macromolecular sequences. Small subunit ribosomal RNAs (16S-like rRNAs) are well-suited for this purpose because they have the same function in all organisms and contain sufficient information to estimate both close and distant evolutionary relationships. Phylogenetic frameworks based upon such comparisons reveal that the plant, animal and fungal lineages are distinct from the diverse spectrum of protozoan lineages. In this letter, phylogenetic analysis of Pneumocystis 16S-like rRNA demonstrates it to be a member of the Fungi.\r"

The role of this protein (invasin) in the virulence process was not, however, investigated. We show that mutation of the invasin gene in Y. pseudotuberculosis abolishes the ability of the bacteria to invade HeLa cells. When mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection both the mutant and the wild-type strain produced infections of similar virulence but mutant showed a slower rate of infection after oral challenge. A double mutant, carrying an additional mutation in the gene coding for the Yop1 protein, was also constructed. The double mutant was significantly more virulent than either the wild-type or the corresponding single mutants. Y. pestis, in contrast to Y. pseudotuberculosis lacks the ability to express either invasin or Yop1, sequence analysis of the yopA gene from both Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis shows that the yopA gene of Y. pestis contains a point-mutation leading to a reading-frame shift. When the yopA+ gene was introduced into Y. pestis the virulence of this strain was reduced. These results may provide insight into the rise and fall of plague epidemics caused by Y. pestis.\r"

The complexity of virus-host cell interaction is reflected in the complex organization of the viral genome. In addition to the genes that encode the virion capsid and envelope proteins and the enzymes required for proviral synthesis and integration common to all retroviruses, HIV-1 is known to encode at least four additional proteins that regulate virus replication, the tat, art, sor and 3' orf proteins, as well as a protein of unknown function from the open reading frame called R. Close examination of the nucleic acid sequences of the genomes of multiple HIV isolates raised the possibility that the virus encodes a previously undetected additional protein. Here we report that HIV-1 encodes a ninth protein and that antibodies to this protein are detected in the sera of people infected with HIV-1. This protein distinguishes HIV-1 isolates from the other human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-2 and SIV) that do not have the capacity to encode a similar protein.\r"

Studies of cloned glucocorticoid receptors reveal that the protein is organized as functional domains, in an arrangement that appears to be common among members of the steroid receptor family. A segment near the centre of the gene specifies DNA binding activity in vitro and contains two sequence motifs similar to 'zinc fingers' found in Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA). Such sequence motifs have been identified in nucleic acid binding proteins from a wide range of organisms. Steroid receptor protein fingers are proposed to bind zinc through two pairs of conserved cysteine residues. We report here that a protein of relative molecular mass 19,000 (Mr = 19 K) encompassing the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor that has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity reversibly ligates two Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions. We show that metal ions are required for specific DNA binding and proper folding. Using EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and visible light spectroscopies, we find that each Zn atom is coordinated in a tetrahedral arrangement by four cysteines.\r"

With ureterovaginal fistulas, the patient's general condition and the degree of obstruction of the ureter influenced the time and method of repair. We used a vaginal approach for urethral fistulas and an abdominal one for ureteral repairs. Because of difficulty with adequate exposure and the proximity of the ureter, an abdominal approach was used in 20% of the patients with vesicovaginal fistulas; the remaining 80% were approached vaginally, regardless of size, number, or history of previous repairs. Ninety-two percent of the urethrovaginal fistulas were corrected on the first attempt; the four failures were managed successfully at the second attempt. Ninety-eight percent of the vesicovaginal fistulas were corrected on the first attempt when approached vaginally, and all were managed successfully when approached abdominally, regardless of the number, size, or previous operative attempts.\r"

The cysts were persistent and did not respond to contraceptive pills for four to eight weeks. In all cases, there were histologic or cytologic results from surgical specimens or fluid aspirated from the cysts. In 15 women, the cysts were aspirated and revealed no malignant cells. Thirty-seven women underwent laparotomy, of whom 11 (29%) were found to have benign ovarian neoplasms (nine cystadenomas and two dermoid cysts). Because benign ovarian neoplasms are potentially malignant, and because a large number was found in our study, we recommend removal of the cysts by excision rather than aspiration.\r"

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of opiate withdrawal would aid in the treatment of PMS. The subjects received either placebo or naltrexone from days 9-18 of the cycle for three consecutive cycles. The mean scores of the three day-25 Menstrual Distress Questionnaires of 16 patients on naltrexone were compared with the mean scores of the same patients on placebo. Scores were at least ten points lower on naltrexone in 11 patients and at least ten points higher on naltrexone in two patients. Score changes of less than ten points were noted in the other three patients. The mean scores dropped 28 points on naltrexone (P = .016). The general acceptability of naltrexone was good, with side effects including nausea, decreased appetite, and dizziness. These results suggest that naltrexone alleviates many PMS symptoms and may be an effective treatment for this syndrome.\r"

Maternal plasma concentrations of nicotine, carbon monoxide, and catecholamines were measured. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, fetal heart rate, and fetal aortic and umbilical vein blood flow increased, while pulsatility indices of the fetal aortic and umbilical artery blood velocity waveforms decreased, with increasing maternal nicotine levels; all were unaffected by carbon monoxide. Catecholamine levels remained unaffected. These results seem to confirm that the maternal nicotine intake due to smoking has an immediate, dose-dependent effect on fetal blood flow.\r"

Dizygotic twins were delivered at 35 weeks' gestation, weighing 2452 and 2386 g. Maternal cyclosporine A levels were determined weekly by whole blood radioimmunoassay, with little increase in requirement found before delivery. No indication of maternal renal compromise was apparent, as evidenced by stable weekly creatinine clearance studies. Cyclosporine A, at the doses used, was passed transplacentally, with cord blood values of 34 and 57% of the maternal cyclosporine A level found at delivery. No adverse effects were noted at birth in the average for gestational age neonates, nor at nine-month follow-up evaluation. Given careful monitoring, cyclosporine A may be an effective immunosuppressant agent for use in pregnancies complicated by renal transplantation.\r"

This sequence of sonographic findings may help clarify the natural history of the developing cloacal anomaly: In the early state of its formation, urine enters the abdominal cavity via the fallopian tubes, causing ascites; later, chronic urinary and meconium irritation of tubal mucosa may cause tubal obstruction, which in turn may lead to the formation of genitourinary tract distention, hydronephrosis, and oligohydramnios. Timely diagnosis of cloacal anomalies improves the outcome of pregnancies (delivery in the tertiary care center, early operative correction).\r"

After the transfer of four concepti in her second IVF/embryo transfer attempt, she became pregnant.

During laparotomy, it was noticed that implantation had taken place near the mesentery of the sigmoid and rectosigmoid. A right cornual tubal ligation was performed.

Harris demonstrated convincingly that death from infection after cesarean section could be reduced significantly by operating early, rather than after several days of labor, by using aseptic surgical technique, and by closing the uterine incision. For the most part, his advice was ignored and the mortality rate remained high, except in hospitals with well-organized and well-controlled obstetric services. Although the incidence of total infections has been decreased by the use of prophylactic antibiotics, too many serious infections and maternal deaths still occur. These can be reduced by proper management of labor, by recognizing the need for cesarean section early, by using alternative methods for delivery when appropriate, by meticulous surgical technique, and by selective use of prophylactic antibiotics. These changes are not likely to occur unless care of obstetric patients is assumed by experienced obstetricians who are prepared to recognize and correct abnormal labor early and to perform instrumental extraction and vaginal breech deliveries rather than cesarean section in carefully selected patients.\r"

Thermal gastrointestinal injury requires resection of the damaged portion of bowel unless the injury involves only the bowel serosa and is less than 0.5 cm in diameter. Small intraoperative lacerations of the intestine can be closed primarily, whereas larger lacerations often require resection. Some degree of postoperative ileus may be expected, but prolonged ileus requires nasogastric suctioning while excluding bowel obstruction, peritonitis, or electrolyte imbalance. Small-bowel obstruction, most likely to be caused by postoperative adhesions, can often be treated successfully by gastrointestinal intubation. Steps required in the initial management of an enterocutaneous fistula include institution of parenteral nutritional supplementation and antibiotics, skin protection, and investigative studies of the fistula. Preventive measures may be used at the time of any surgical procedure to reduce the incidence of many of these complications.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for more than 50% of late infections. Animal studies have shown that joint implants are at a high risk of becoming infected via a metastatic hematogenous route during transient bacteremias. Because cephalosporins have been established as the perioperative and intraoperative agents of choice to prevent infections related to total joint replacement, oral cephalosporins are the drugs of choice to minimize the potential for the metastatic infection of prosthetic joints associated with transient dental bacteremias. Clindamycin is preferred for patients who are allergic to the cephalosporins or who may have a cross-allergy between penicillin and the cephalosporins.\r"

The most notable changes involved mucosal color (white and red), atrophy, vascularity, ulceration, increased salivary viscosity and xerostomia, and the patients' subjective complaints of dryness and oral pain. The ventral tongue, buccal and labial mucosa, and marginal gingiva manifested the most notable changes, while the palate was least affected. The overall trend was for the oral changes to begin slightly before transplantation, to worsen over the first 2 weeks after transplantation, and then to resolve progressively over the remainder of the study period. These oral changes appear to result from a number of insults, including the conditioning chemoradiotherapy, posttransplant immunosuppressive chemotherapy, xerostomia, local trauma, oral infections (especially those caused by HSV), and possibly acute GVHD. Oral HSV infection and/or acute GVHD should especially be considered if the oral status markedly worsens 21 days or more after transplant.\r"

Of these, 42 patients were assigned alternative clinical diagnoses, 71% of which were confirmed by immunostaining and histology. Thus, MMP was clinically diagnosed in 34 patients (28 women and 6 men, with an average age of 59 years). However, unequivocal histologic confirmation of this diagnosis was obtained for only 4 patients, and direct immunostaining confirmation was obtained for just 7 patients. On the basis of a combination of the clinical, histopathologic, and direct immunofluorescence examinations, in only 3 of the 34 patients (8%) was an unequivocal diagnosis of classic MMP possible.\r"

The current approach via direct measurement of endogenous opioid peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not devoid of side effects and cannot be used in every-day practice. As an alternative to this method, we have studied the neuroendocrine response of plasma LH to an i.v. naloxone injection in 39 headache sufferers from different diagnostic subgroups, and in 12 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Patients (19 females and 20 males) were affected by common migraine (CM, 11 cases), migraine with interparoxysmal headache (MIH, 9), classical migraine (CIM, 9), and chronic cluster headache (CH, 10). Headache lasted 3-36 years. Prior to naloxone challenge (4 mg i.v.), LH pulsatility was evaluated for 1 h. The next morning, the pituitary response to LH-RH (10 micrograms i.v.) was tested in 20 patients. Plasma LH was measured by RIA in every sample. The response to the tests was evaluated as secretion area of plasma LH minus the mean basal value. Controls (497.5 +/- 85.5 mIU/ml x 120 min), ClM (357.8 +/- 78.9) and CH (450.5 +/- 70.4) patients showed similar results, while in cases of CM (155.3 +/- 71.7, P less than 0.05) and MIH (104.1 +/- 53.7, P less than 0.01) the LH secretion after naloxone injection was significantly blunted. On the contrary, the response of LH to LH-RH was similar in controls and patient groups, thus excluding pituitary dysfunctions in this response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results indicate that children in families with incomes below the poverty level, especially those without Medicaid insurance, are much less likely to receive routine preventive care on a timely basis. Poor school-aged children with Medicaid are much more likely to receive timely preventive care than their counterparts without Medicaid coverage.

Similar analyses of the 8-hour ischemic grafts revealed both a qualitative and statistically significant quantitative difference (p less than 0.001) between the superoxide dismutase-treated and control grafts in parameters related to viability.

He showed a great interest in hand surgery, and interesting is a demonstration of flexor tendon repairs on corpses by one of his pupils. It is still a great joy to read his book today, which also gives a good representation of the state of the art of surgery in the seventeenth century in Amsterdam (Fig. 11). Names and addresses of patients are fully mentioned, so even today we know exactly where they lived and where the events took place. On the other hand, we also know quite well what the surgeons and doctors looked like through the efforts of many excellent painters who depicted anatomy lessons. In Amsterdam, barber-surgeons' guilds were very eager to sit for group paintings, centered around the teaching medical doctor (Table I). The painter Aert Pietersz in 1603 painted Dr. Sebastiaan Egberts surrounded by 29 surgeons, and in 1619, Dr. Egberts was painted once more, this time with five learning surgeons, by Thomas de Keyzer. Nicolaes Eliasz, named Pickenoy, painted Dr. Johan Fonteyn in 1625, and Rembrandt is well known for the Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp (1632) and Dr. Deyman (1656). It is peculiar that a portrait of van Meekeren could not be traced.\r"

It may be performed at large medical centers or small rural hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even private offices. Patients themselves have indicated preference for endoscopic evaluation over the double-contrast barium meal after they have experienced both procedures. The short time of procedure, its accuracy, safety, and its relative lack of discomfort to the patient lend it readily to being an initial component in the primary evaluation of symptoms of abdominal distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia, esophageal reflux, persistent vomiting, and odynophagia. It is essential in the evaluation of complications of esophageal reflux and the evaluation of abnormal radiological findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It should never be overlooked in evaluating the patient with iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Economic pressures have already moved EGD from the surgery wards to endoscopy labs and to the outpatient setting. These same forces will project more physicians into the role of the diagnostic endoscopist and the patient will benefit by decreased medical costs, quicker diagnosis and treatment, and enhanced continuity of care.\r"

Present therapeutic options may be summarized as follows: Asymptomatic patients and those with flatulence and dyspepsia who have gallstones should be observed. Those who have symptoms of biliary pain, gallstone-induced pancreatitis, or common duct stones should have corrective surgery. Those who refuse surgery or who aren't surgical candidates might be treated with dissolution therapy. Dissolution of gallstones with chemical agents and extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy show some promise. We need a better understanding of the etiology and formation of gallstones to address the disease from a preventive standpoint and reduce the incidence of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, and their complications.\r"

Of the 481 patients in whom the filter had been in place for 6 months or more, 440 were followed up clinically. The prevalence of clinically suspected recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism was 2.7% (12 patients) and that of inferior vena cava filter occlusion was 2.9% (13 patients). With the initial filter design, filter migration occurred in five patients. No migrations have occurred in the 147 patients treated with the filter after its modification to improve the anchoring system for greater stability. The bird's nest filter has proved safe and effective in the prevention of pulmonary embolism.\r"

In 47% of cases, both lobes were involved. The tumors had a strong tendency to compress (80%) or infiltrate (53%) the surrounding structures. The frequency of calcification (7%) or necrosis (7%) was low. Most patients (87%) had a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass, and six (40%) complained of symptoms from obstruction. All patients had coexistent Hashimoto thyroiditis. In 13 of 15 patients (87%), a highly probable diagnosis of thyroid lymphomas was determined with CT and clinical findings. A staging workup with CT and clinical findings confirmed at biopsy will allow appropriate therapy and may lead to improved prognosis for patients with this condition.\r"

Percutaneous biopsy with ultrasonographic (US) guidance was performed in all 52 masses, 44 of which were nonpalpable. Malignant cells were obtained in 29 biopsies, and the results of 20 biopsies were negative, yielding benign lymphocytes only. Results in three biopsies were nondiagnostic due to hypocellular specimens. Therefore, 94% of biopsy results (49) of 52) were confidently assigned as either positive (56%) or negative (38%) for malignancy. There were no complications. High-frequency sonography can demonstrate clinically occult thyroid bed tumor recurrence and lymph node metastases. US-guided biopsy is an accurate and safe technique to confirm or exclude malignancy in patients at high risk of recurrence of thyroid cancer.\r"

A twisted or hemorrhagic cyst was cystic with a fluid-debris level, cystic with a retracting clot, septated with or without internal echoes, or solid (12 cases). These complicated cysts contained liquid and/or organized hematoma. Eleven of the 12 complicated cysts had a thin, highly echogenic wall. Cyst torsion commonly occurred in utero and could be diagnosed on prenatal sonograms by a typical sonographic appearance (eight cases). All of these infants were asymptomatic after birth. Four infants with hemorrhagic or twisted cysts were symptomatic. All cysts except one that resolved spontaneously were treated surgically, including three twisted cysts that showed no change in size over a 1-8-month interval. All of the cysts were of follicular origin.\r"

A significant correlation (r = 0.88, n = 52, p less than 0.001) between laser Doppler signal and coronary blood flow was found during cardiac arrest. During ventricular fibrillation after release of the aortic cross-clamp there was significant correlation (0.84, n = 38, p less than 0.01) between laser Doppler signal and extracorporeal blood flow. A residual laser Doppler signal of about 60% of the maximal value was recorded even after the bypass flow was discontinued. Laser Doppler flowmetry is concluded to permit measurement of myocardial perfusion in the arrested porcine heart. Muscular activity of the heart contributes to the output signal during ventricular fibrillation.\r"

When the saphenous vein or internal mammary artery was used as bypass graft, the reduction in skin blood flow at the sites from which the vessels were taken was significantly greater than in contralateral, undisturbed sites. RFR and P-WFR were also significantly reduced postoperatively, and these changes showed significant concomitance with the fall in laser doppler flow (LDF%). On postoperative day 6 there was some improvement in LDF% and RFR but further slight deterioration in P-WFR. The study indicated that surgical trauma locally reduces cutaneous blood flow and that trauma to blood cells following cardiopulmonary bypass can contribute to this reduction.\r"

A series of fusion genes was constructed to examine the mechanism of hormone-regulated transcriptional enhancement. The DNA binding domain of the bacterial LexA repressor was fused to receptor derivatives lacking the region that is necessary and sufficient for specific DNA binding and transcriptional enhancement at glucocorticoid response elements (GRE's). The resultant hybrid proteins activated transcription from promoters linked to the lex operator. Enhancement still required hormone binding by the hybrid receptor regardless of the exact positioning of the LexA binding domain within the protein. Thus, the unliganded hormone binding domain of the receptor acts as a strong but reversible inhibitor of receptor activity in a manner that is independent of the means by which the receptor recognizes DNA. The results also show directly that the receptor contains at least one \"enhancement domain\" other than that overlapping the GRE binding region; the second domain, enh2, occupies a region near the receptor amino terminus.\r"

Glycine has been reported to potentiate NMDA responses in neurons and in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain messenger RNA. Glycine is now shown to be absolutely required for activation of NMDA receptors in oocytes. In voltage-clamped oocytes, neither perfusion nor rapid pressure application of NMDA onto messenger RNA-injected oocytes caused a distinct ionic current without added glycine. When glycine was added, however, NMDA evoked large inward currents. The concentration of glycine required to produce a half-maximal response was 670 nanomolar, and the glycine dose-response curve extrapolated to zero in the absence of glycine. Several analogs of glycine could substitute for glycine, among which D-serine and D-alanine were the most effective. The observation that D-amino acids are effective will be important in developing drugs targeted at the glycine site.\r"

Both DNA probes identify a cytologically undetectable deletion associated with a balanced chromosome translocation inherited by a patient with familial aniridia, but not Wilms' tumor. The same two DNA segments are also included in the distal p13-p14.1 deletion of another patient, who has aniridia, Wilms' tumor, and hypogonadism, but they are not included in the p12-p13 deletion of a third patient, who does not have aniridia but has had a Wilms' tumor. The discovery of this aniridia deletion and these two DNA segments that physically separate the Wilms' tumor and aniridia loci should facilitate identification of the genes in the WAGR locus, beginning with the aniridia gene.\r"

The gene encoding the designed protein was synthesized and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The protein was shown to be monomeric, highly helical, and very stable to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl).

He wrote on the complications of malnutrition and attempted to delineate the specific effects of individual nutritional factors. Dr. Sydenstricker and his associate H. M. Cleckley first described the syndrome of niacin deficiency encephalopathy. Today, the syndrome is still occasionally reported. Niacin deficiency should be considered when unexplained acute confusional states or neurologic deficits occur in the setting of malnutrition, antituberculous drug use, or chronic partial nutritional deficiency with acute increase in metabolic demand.\r"

The other half of the patients had only routine postoperative instructions for rest, elevation, and protective splinting. Range of motion and strength measurements were done preoperatively and at intervals up to three months after operation. Analysis of results shows little difference in range of motion measurements in either group. However, return of strength in the extremity operated on was significantly augmented, up to 150% of the control group, in the patients who received cross-education training. Application of this principle to rehabilitation after injury to specific functional units may increase recovery.\r"

Although intrathoracic lymphadenopathy was more common in primary tuberculosis, we do not believe that intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is as specific for primary tuberculosis, particularly in the adult, as was once thought. For this reason, we believe that the roentgenographic demonstration of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy should not be used as a definitive research or clinical criterion for primary tuberculosis in an adult.\r"

A cysteine proteinase, cathepsin B released no more than 45% of glycosaminoglycan. X-ray films clearly showed narrowing of the disc space when 30-40% of glycosaminoglycan was removed.

The usual age-linked decline of bone mass failed to occur in females and was statistically not significant in males. A few changes with age were noted at the cellular level. Sex differences were statistically significant only in animals living into the third year of life, males having a smaller bone mass than females. This abnormality of the vertebral spongiosa is attributed to pathologic local stresses caused by the numerous instances of disc degeneration and herniation. Differences in size, location, and age of the herniations are thought to account for the wide fluctuations in the individual bone parameters examined. Whereas the spine of the sand rat provides an excellent model for the study of spondylosis, it is unsuited as a model for age-linked osteoporosis.\r"

Exudative macular detachment and a circumscribed fundus mass are more common in women.

With each new radiologic innovation producing a forward surge followed by a period of refinement, new methods were invented and utilized to their diagnostic limits.

  ".W": "Pulmonary function was measured before and at intervals after treatment in 44 patients who received a bone marrow transplant for chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase. All patients were treated with cytotoxic drugs, total body irradiation, and post-graft immunosuppression. Thirty four patients surviving for 12 months were followed at three monthly intervals and 16 patients for 24 months. Fifteen patients received unmanipulated donor marrow cells and 29 patients received donor marrow cells depleted of lymphocytes ex vivo with the monoclonal antibody Campath-1. The 21 patients treated early in this study received 10 Gy of total body irradiation whereas the 23 patients treated more recently, who were all T lymphocyte depleted, received 12 Gy. Pretransplant lung function for the group was normal and was similar in survivors (n = 34) and nonsurvivors (n = 10), and in smokers (n = 8) and non-smokers (n = 36). (Carbon monoxide transfer factor--TLCO) was under 75% of predicted normal in nine patients before transplantation. TLCO, carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO), FEV1, and vital capacity (VC) values were lower 6 and 12 months after bone marrow transplant than initially. The greatest decline was in TLCO, from an initial value of 89% to 66% at 6 and 70% at 12 months. The 16 longer term survivors showed significant recovery of function between 6 and 24 months after bone marrow transplant for TLCO, KCO, and VC, the increase ranging from 6.3% to 7.3% predicted. Airflow obstruction (FEV1/VC ratio less than 70%) developed in one patient. The major factors associated with deterioration in pulmonary function at 6 and 12 months after transplantation in the 34 survivors (stepwise multiple regression analysis) were (a) transplantation with T cell depleted donor marrow (p less than 0.005) and higher total body irradiation dose (p less than 0.02) with a fall in KCO and an increase in the FEV1/VC ratio; (b) chronic graft versus host disease with a fall in VC (p less than 0.01); and less fall in KCO (p less than 0.01); and (c) acute graft versus host disease with a fall in FEV1 (p less than 0.01). It is considered that most patients who survive the short term risks of bone marrow transplant have only minor long term impairment of pulmonary function.\r"

The effect of both a single dose (8.8 mg) and 14 days' treatment (8.8 mg twice daily) with azelastine on bronchoconstriction induced by LTC4 and histamine has been examined in 10 patients with mild asthma in a placebo controlled, double blind, crossover study. LTC4 and histamine were inhaled in doubling concentrations from a dosimeter and the results expressed as the cumulative dose (PD) producing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20FEV1) and 35% fall in specific airways conductance (PD35sGaw). The single dose of azelastine produced a significantly greater FEV1 and sGaw values than placebo at 3 hours, but this bronchodilator effect was not present after 14 days of treatment. Azelastine was an effective H1 antagonist; after a single dose and 14 days' treatment with placebo the geometric mean PD20FEV1 histamine values (mumol) were 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.14-1.83) and 0.54 (0.12-2.38), compared with 22.9 (11.5-38.3) and 15.2 (6.47-35.6) after azelastine (p less than 0.01 for both). LTC4 was on average 1000 times more potent than histamine in inducing bronchoconstriction. Azelastine did not inhibit the effect of inhaled LTC4; the geometric mean PD20FEV1 LTC4 (nmol) after a single dose and 14 days' treatment was 0.60 and 0.59 with placebo compared with 0.65 and 0.75 with azelastine. The PD35sGaw LTC4 was also unchanged at 0.66 and 0.73 for placebo compared with 0.83 and 0.74 for azelastine. Thus prolonged blockade of H1 receptors did not attenuate the response to LTC4, suggesting that histamine and LTC4 act on bronchial smooth muscle through different receptors. Four patients complained of drowsiness while taking azelastine but only one who was taking placebo and three patients complained of a bitter, metallic taste while taking azelastine.\r"

All kidneys transplanted with two or less HLA-A + B mismatches survived at 1 year. With three mismatched antigens survival was of 88.9%. This value was reduced to 66.7% for four incompatibilities. A similar situation was found for HLA-DR matching since all kidneys with full compatibility survived at 1 year compared with 90.9% and 66.7% for one and two mismatches, respectively. HLA-B and HLA-DR exhibited an additive effect since again all grafts with two or less mismatches survived, whereas in the group with three different antigens this figure was 90% and only 1 of the three kidneys with completely different antigens survived.\r"

Flexible endoscopes that possess a working channel and can also be employed for treatment have at last been developed. This instrument is particularly effective in the treatment of stones in the upper urinary tract, as it can easily follow mobile upper ureteral stones and calculi in the middle or lower renal calices, which are not as accessible with a rigid endoscope. It is important to remember not to exert too much force when inserting the instrument into the ureter, renal pelvis, or renal calices, and, if one remains calm, should the visual field become temporarily obscured, there should be little danger of damaging these structures. This method will probably be increasingly employed, not only for the treatment of stones in the upper urinary tract, but also for the removal of foreign bodies and the diagnosis and treatment of small pathologic conditions or lesions such as carcinoma in situ in which the roentgenologic presentation is unclear. For this expansion of instrument use to be ensured, it is necessary to improve the resolution of the fiberoptic endoscope image and increase the instrument's angulation capabilities, increase the range of accessories that can be employed with it, and also increase familiarity with the instruments on the part of urologists.\r"

The essential step is bacterial adhesion to receptor sites on uroepithelial cells. Women who suffer recurrent infections have more receptive cells than the cells of other women. Long-term antimicrobial therapy reduces susceptibility to reinfection. Bringing patients into an understanding of their infectious process and into a partnership in the alleviation of their suffering is a powerful therapeutic tool.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional criterion of 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of urine to diagnose urinary tract infection was based on studies of pregnant and nonpregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria or acute pyelonephritis. Recent studies of symptomatic women revealed that urine cultures in approximately one third of those with confirmed urinary tract infections grew only 10(2) to 10(4) CFU/mL. The major causes of acute dysuria among such women are urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted disease, and vaginitis. In most instances, it is possible to make the diagnosis based on clinical features. The major features of urinary tract infection are internal dysuria; frequency, urgency, and voiding of small volumes; abrupt onset; suprapubic pain; presence of pyuria. Presence of hematuria which occurs in about 50 percent of patients strongly suggests bacterial cystitis. Three to seven days of empiric antimicrobial therapy is indicated for these patients, with selection of a first-line antimicrobial agent that offers efficacy against Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus; reasonable cost; few side effects. Ampicillin is not recommended. Indications for culture include uncertain clinical features; history of previous infection within the past three weeks; duration of symptoms of more than seven days; recent hospitalization or catheterization; pregnancy; diabetes. To maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the urine culture in acutely symptomatic women, it is necessary to request the laboratory to report 10(2) to 10(4) CFU/mL.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler sonographic measurement of blood velocity and associated physiologic parameters is a powerful diagnostic technique. State-of-the-art instrumentation incorporates velocity measurement with two-dimensional imaging capability; it uses intensity and color coding to display complex physiologic and anatomic data to the observer in an easily understood format. Although the concepts underlying Doppler sonography are not complex, mastery of the technique requires extra training and commitment. The principal features and clinical practicalities associated with Doppler sonography are summarized in the following paragraphs. Continuous-wave Doppler is very sensitive to small vessels and has no upper velocity limit. In addition, the instrumentation is not complex and produces relatively low acoustic power. A significant drawback to continuous-wave Doppler is that there is no depth sensitivity, and thus complex structures or multiple vessels can give conflicting information. Pulsed Doppler (including duplex and color-flow) instrumentation has the capability of depth resolution and a variable sample volume. Pulsed Doppler equipment is prone to aliasing (false velocity indications) under some circumstances and also produces higher peak power levels than does continuous-wave equipment. Duplex equipment is more complex and expensive than continuous-wave equipment because the two-dimensional and Doppler modes must be synchronized in operation and display. Color-flow equipment is extremely complex and expensive. Color flow provides information of a qualitative and limited quantitative value. Absolute measurement still requires range-gate measurements. Technical and anatomic factors will affect the measured velocity profiles. Thus, it is important to fully appreciate the anatomy of the vessel and the angle between the vessel and the ultrasound beam when making quantitative measurements. Measurements that evaluate the velocity waveform and make use of ratios, such as the pulsatility index, eliminate the need for angular corrections; however, artifacts due to unappreciated anatomic or wall characteristics may lead to incorrect information if all parameters are not fully understood. Doppler sonographic measurements may be used to determine the presence of flow, determine the direction of flow, identify time-varying velocity characteristics, and detect velocity disturbances. Because flow and velocity are related, it is possible to estimate flow from velocity measurements with careful calibration and proper precautions. Velocity is related to flow, which, in turn, is related to both pressure and vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "AIDS is now a common disease, seen daily in large metropolitan medical centers. Neuroimaging techniques such as CT and MR are critical to the detection and diagnosis of CNS complications. Intracerebral infections are common. These infections frequently are caused by opportunistic organisms; less commonly, they are bacterial infections. The cranial imaging features on CT and MR are not pathognomonic, but their distribution or appearance (e.g., asymmetric target lesions of toxoplasmosis) may have predictive value in a known AIDS patient. The superior contrast resolution of MR makes it a more sensitive cross-sectional imaging tool for evaluating intracerebral abnormalities associated with a variety of infectious processes. Differential diagnoses still include metastatic disease, lymphoma, and infarcts. When MR is used as the initial cross-sectional imaging study, contrast-enhanced CT may still be necessary to further characterize a lesion. Currently, more experience exists with CT for follow-up of the AIDS patient with CNS manifestations. MR, particularly with gadolinium-DTPA as a contrast medium, will probably become the imaging method of choice.\r"

  ".W": "When hepatic artery thrombosis occurs after liver transplantation, another transplantation is required to ensure the patient's survival. Because of the importance of establishing this diagnosis, we reviewed the results of duplex sonography in 37 angiographically or surgically proved cases of hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation. There were 20 children and 17 adults. Ten of the 20 children had angiographically documented hepatopetal arterial collaterals. Such collaterals were not seen in the adult patients. This subset of patients was evaluated separately to determine if intrahepatic arterial blood flow reestablished by collaterals after hepatic artery thrombosis was a cause of false-negative Doppler studies. Thirty-four (92%) of the 37 cases of hepatic artery thrombosis were correctly identified by Doppler. A Doppler pulse was not identified in any of the children with arterial collaterals. We conclude that duplex sonography is sensitive in detecting hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the presence of blood flow in hepatopetal arterial collaterals does not cause false-negative examinations.\r"

To determine the validity of this assumption, we performed percutaneous biopsies of the liver under CT or sonographic guidance in 28 patients who had ascites and in 28 patients who did not have ascites and compared the complication rates in the two groups. Twenty-two patients (79%) in the group with ascites and 19 patients (68%) in the group without ascites had biopsies to determine the cause or extent of chronic liver disease. The remainder were oncologic patients who had biopsies to determine the cause of a focal hepatic mass. The complication rate in the patients who had ascites (32%) was less than that in the patients who did not have ascites (43%) (the difference did not reach statistical significance, p less than .30). In the ascites group, complications included transient hypotension (five patients), a mild-to-moderate fall in hematocrit (three patients), and a small leak of ascites from the biopsy site (one patient). In the control group, minor complications included transient hypotension (three patients), a mild-to-moderate fall in hematocrit (seven patients), and a small subcapsular hematoma (one patient). One major complication occurred in the control group: a patient required a blood transfusion because of the fall in his hematocrit. We conclude that the complication rate in liver biopsies guided by CT or sonography in the presence of ascites is not higher than similar biopsies done in the absence of ascites. Ascites should not be considered a contraindication for performing such biopsies.\r"

  ".U": "88307182\r", 
  ".W": "Six patients were reviewed who had renal angiomyolipoma (1.2-4.0 cm) in which only minimal amounts of fat were evident on CT. The fat content of the lesion was appreciated because tissue attenuation measurements of small areas of low attenuation within the tumors were performed and because thin-section (5-mm) and nonenhanced CT scans were used. The fat content of the lesions could be identified on 10-mm sections in three cases but only on 5-mm sections in three others. In two cases, fat was seen only on the nonenhanced 5-mm thin sections. Careful sampling of low-density regions within the mass must be performed because a single region of interest over the entire tumor will produce an average attenuation in the soft-tissue range. The use of 5-mm thin sections and thin, nonenhanced CT sections increases spatial and density resolution and decreases susceptibility to partial-volume effects. In a correlative study, no areas of fat were detected in a review of 100 well-circumscribed (4.0 cm or smaller) renal cell carcinomas. Detecting the existence of fat in a renal lesion will establish the diagnosis of angiomyolipoma and is the only radiologic finding that can differentiate it from renal cell carcinoma. Thus, unnecessary surgery will be avoided in these cases.\r"

  ".U": "88307184\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed our experience with 51 renal transplants to evaluate the accuracy of antegrade pyelography as compared with that of sonography and nuclear renography in the diagnosis of transplant obstruction. Also, the results of percutaneous treatment were analyzed in 44 of these patients. Obstruction was clinically suspected in all of the patients (increased serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output). Antegrade pyelography showed obstruction in 44 (86%) of the 51 patients, and nephrostomy drainage catheters were inserted. Sonography showed pyelocaliectasis in all 49 cases in which it was performed; in 42, the pyelocaliectasis was due to obstruction (14% false-positive rate). Nuclear renography showed obstruction in only six (18%) of 33 cases in which it was performed; all six cases proved to be obstructed (0% false-positive rate and 82% false-negative rate). Twenty-two (50%) of the 44 patients treated with nephrostomy drainage were managed successfully without surgical intervention; seven of these 22 required balloon dilation of ureteric strictures in addition to catheter decompression of the collecting system. The average duration of catheterization required for successful percutaneous treatment was 35 days. This experience suggests that antegrade pyelography has a definite role in the workup of patients suspected of having renal transplant obstruction. The percutaneous access permits successful catheter drainage. Compared with antegrade pyelography, sonography is reasonably accurate in determining the presence of urinary obstruction, although false-positive diagnoses are found in a substantial number of patients. Nuclear renography is not, however, a useful indicator of obstruction owing to its high false-negative rate. Percutaneous treatment of urinary obstruction in transplantation patients proves successful in approximately 50% of cases.\r"

The leak was proved by surgery in 11 of the 12 cases. We also determined the role of diverting percutaneous nephrostomy drainage in the treatment of such leaks. The diagnosis was established by sonography in eight (67%) of the 12 patients. Nuclear renography, performed in nine patients, showed decreased renal function but showed the leak in only three (33%) of the nine cases. Antegrade pyelography, performed in all 12 patients, showed leakage in 10 (83%). In the other two patients, follow-up nephrostograms done within 24 hr showed leaks near the ureterovesical anastomotic site. Seven of 11 patients who were managed with a combination of percutaneous nephrostomy drainage and surgical reconstruction were treated successfully (i.e., a functioning graft was retained); however, only one patient was managed successfully by percutaneous methods alone. Antegrade pyelography is more accurate than sonography and nuclear renography in the detection of urine leakage after renal transplantation. However, percutaneous nephrostomy drainage appears useful only as an adjunct to surgery for treatment of this complication.\r"

In the double-blind study, a total of 84 patients received 50 ml of either iopamidol or diatrizoate. In the open-label study, another 42 patients received a 100-ml dose of iopamidol. Image opacification scores after the administration of the 50-ml doses showed better opacification with iopamidol than with diatrizoate in the renal calices (p less than .05) and in the composite kidney (p less than .05). Opacification scores were higher for 100-ml doses of iopamidol than for 50-ml doses in all anatomic regions as well as in the composite kidney (p = .0001). Patients' tolerance to iopamidol was significantly better than their tolerance to diatrizoate (p less than .025). Investigators observed adverse drug reactions in a total of 10 patients. In the double-blind study, one of 43 patients had transient bradycardia after the administration of iopamidol. In the same study, four of 41 patients who received diatrizoate had five minor adverse drug reactions. With 100-ml doses of iopamidol, five of 42 patients had adverse reactions. No adverse side effects required therapy in either study. There were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values after drug administration. The results of this study show that iopamidol is a suitable agent for excretory urography at doses of 50 and 100 ml. Patients report fewer unpleasant side effects with iopamidol than with diatrizoate. Overall image quality was better with iopamidol than with diatrizoate. Overall evaluation of drug performance was better with iopamidol than with diatrizoate.\r"

Twenty-one children at The Montreal Children's Hospital and at St. Justine Hospital were treated with this technique over a 2-year period. In 15 children, abdominal sonography was performed 1-5 days after Teflon paste injections. Follow-up sonograms performed 5 weeks to 1 year after the procedure are available in nine children. Sonographically, the Teflon paste at the injection site appears as a hyperechoic focus within the bladder wall with distal shadowing seen postoperatively and on follow-up examinations. This finding occurred in 22 (88%) of 25 treated ureters. The location of Teflon paste after injection as viewed via cystoscopy is correlated with the sonographic appearance. This preliminary report suggests that sonography is useful in determining the location and size of the Teflon mass, in evaluating surrounding soft tissues at various time intervals after injection, and in assessing possible complications such as obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "To document the characteristic sonographic abnormalities of anencephaly and to identify potentially confusing sonographic features, we reviewed 20 cases of anencephaly. All of these cases were diagnosed prenatally with sonography after 14 menstrual weeks in patients who were seen at our institution between 1984 and 1988. In all cases, the correct diagnosis was made on the prenatal sonograms and was confirmed pathologically. The sonographic diagnosis was primarily based on the absence of brain and calvarium superior to the orbits on coronal views of the fetal head. This typical appearance was altered by the presence of echogenic tissue superior to the orbits in nine (45%) of 20 cases. Pathologically, the tissue corresponded to angiomatous stroma (area cerebrovasculosa) and appeared quite sizable on sonograms in four fetuses (20%). It may appear solid or mixed solid and cystic. In one fetus, it appeared brainlike. Despite this appearance, the sonologist should not be dissuaded from the diagnosis of classic anencephaly. Hydramnios occurred in seven (35%) of 20 patients, and oligohydramnios occurred in none of the patients. Anencephaly may be distinguished from the cranial defects associated with the amniotic band syndrome (amputation defects that occur as the sequelae of amniotic disruption) on the basis of the symmetry of the cranial defects (100% of anencephalic fetuses in this series) and the absence of limb, body wall, and spinal abnormalities that typically accompany the amniotic band syndrome. Although there may be minor variations in the sonographic appearance of the cranial defect of anencephalic fetuses (i.e., much or little angiomatous stroma), we conclude that this anomaly can be accurately detected and diagnosed on fetal sonograms obtained after 14 weeks menstrual age and distinguished from the amniotic band syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "88307260\r", 
  ".W": "Radioligand binding studies have demonstrated convincingly the coexistence of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors in the human heart. Both subtypes are involved in the increase in tissue levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in isolated, electrically driven, human right atria and in the activation of adenylate cyclase in human cardiac membrane preparations. In isolated, electrically driven strips of human right atria, isoproterenol increased contractile force through stimulation of both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, while the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, caused its positive inotropic effect predominantly through beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. Norepinephrine, however, increased contractile force solely via beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. In this preparation, dobutamine also acted as a full agonist, producing a positive inotropic effect through stimulation of both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. Dopexamine hydrochloride, on the other hand, having an approximately 10-fold greater affinity for right atrial beta 2 than for beta 1 adrenoceptors, acted as a partial agonist (maximal positive inotropic effect: about 30% that of isoproterenol). Similar effects have been obtained in human right and left ventricular strips; thus, there can be no doubt that cardiac beta 2 adrenoceptors can contribute to the positive inotropic effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists in the human heart. Besides mediating positive inotropic effects, right atrial beta 2 adrenoceptors may be involved in the regulation of heart rate since, in healthy volunteers, the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, was more potent than the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol, in antagonizing isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, when both antagonists were administered in doses that selectively occupied more than 90% of beta 2 and beta 1 adrenoceptors, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88307263\r", 
  ".W": "The phrase \"heart failure\" encompasses many clinical entities. The therapeutic principles determining the treatment of these entities vary according to the etiology of congestive heart failure (CHF), the existing hemodynamics, and the mode of action of different drugs. In acute CHF due to myocardial ischemia, intracellular acidosis and the accumulation of phosphate may be the initial underlying causes of contractile failure while, minutes later, lack of high-energy compounds may be an important contributory factor. The cause of contractile failure in chronic syndromes is less well understood. There is evidence for the desensitization of beta receptors on the cell surface but the precise location of the defect is unclear. The receptors may be down-regulated but, in addition, abnormalities have been reported in several other parts of the contractile pathway including the contractile proteins and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Deficiency of cyclic adenosine monophosphate has also been suggested as a mechanism of contractile failure. In both acute and chronic CHF, there is a redistribution of blood flow to the body organs. Of particular significance is the reduction of blood flow to the kidneys, and a reversal of this defect is one of the major therapeutic objectives. Positive inotropic drugs, vasodilators and drugs altering relaxation of the heart, have been evaluated in the treatment of CHF. Pure inotropic drugs can cause tachycardia, ischemia and \"metabolic exhaustion\" of the myocardium. The most advantageous profile for an \"inotropic\" drug in many patients with CHF would be a drug combining systemic vasodilatation, renal vasodilatation, increased relaxation of the myocardium only a mild positive inotropic effect and no chronotropic effect.\r"

Studies in healthy subjects confirmed the cardiovascular activity of dopexamine hydrochloride and demonstrated its potency. Doses of 0.5 to 8 micrograms/kg/min doubled cardiac output without change in mean blood pressure, although pulse pressure did widen. In patients with stable chronic cardiac failure (mainly New York Heart Association class III), dopexamine hydrochloride (4 micrograms/kg/min) increased stroke volume 47 +/- 9%, cardiac index 64 +/- 10% and heart rate 11.7 +/- 3%. Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 42 +/- 5%. At higher doses, cardiac index increased further, but chronotropic effects became more prominent. Subsequent studies in patients recovering from cardiac surgery and studies of longer duration in patients with chronic congestive heart failure have demonstrated a similar hemodynamic profile that is sustained throughout the infusion. The renal vasodilator effects have been confirmed in both healthy subjects and patients. With all catecholamines the balance of chronotropic to inotropic or vasodilator effect is critical. Dopexamine hydrochloride (1 to 4 micrograms/kg/min) increases cardiac index by over 40% at clinically insignificant (10%) increases of heart rate.\r"

Dopexamine hydrochloride is one-third as potent as dopamine in stimulating DA1 receptors but 60 times as potent as a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Unlike dopamine, it is a weak beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist and does not stimulate vascular alpha adrenoceptors. Its stimulant properties at vascular DA1 receptors and at vascular beta 2 adrenoceptors endow it with the ability to improve renal blood flow and to increase cardiac output secondary to afterload reduction. In addition, mild positive inotropic activity arises from stimulation of cardiac beta 2 adrenoceptors, potentiation of endogenous norepinephrine due to uptake-1 blockade, and activation of the baroreceptor reflex. Other features of dopexamine hydrochloride that should enhance its clinical use are lack of arrhythmogenicity and rapid responsiveness to alterations in infusion rate.\r"

Subjects ingested a liquid meal and TEM was measured for 180 min postprandially. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) were determined before and after meal ingestion. Absolute RMR was comparable between VEG and NVEG. However, TEM was lower (p less than 0.01) in VEG (55.8 +/- 3.3 kcal/180 min) vs NVEG (76.4 +/- 3.6). Plasma levels of glucose and insulin were similar between the two groups whereas plasma T3 was slightly but nonsignificantly lower in vegetarians. A vegetarian diet may decrease the postprandial thermic response; this does not support the supposition that an elevated TEM is a factor contributing to the lower body weight in vegetarians than in omnivores.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that short-term insulin therapy may induce long-lasting metabolic improvements in patients with type 2 diabetes resistant to oral therapy, 19 patients were studied before and four weeks after insulin therapy, and again four weeks after resumption of oral medication. The mechanisms associated with changes of glycemic control after discontinuation of insulin therapy were also evaluated. During insulin therapy, blood glucose levels (228 +/- 13 versus 123 +/- 18 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and the basal glucose production rate (p less than 0.001) decreased, and the insulin secretory response to glucagon at a standardized glucose level, insulin action in vivo, and insulin binding and action in vitro in fat cells improved significantly. During the post-insulin oral therapy, blood glucose levels increased (194 +/- 11 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) but remained below pre-insulin treatment values (p less than 0.01). The mean daily glucose concentration after post-insulin oral therapy correlated with the initial pre-insulin therapy glucose concentration (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001). The improved rate of in vivo glucose disposal and the enhanced insulin secretory response persisted during oral therapy whereas the basal glucose production rate returned to its pre-insulin therapy value. It is concluded that patients with type 2 diabetes in whom oral therapy fails show favorable responses to insulin therapy. After discontinuation of insulin therapy, blood glucose concentrations tend to return to their individual initial values. Therefore, most of these patients require long-term insulin therapy. The mechanism behind the change of glycemic control after cessation of insulin therapy seems to be an increase in the basal glucose production rate rather than deterioration of extrahepatic insulin action or the insulin secretory response.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies show that sucrose does not aggravate hyperglycemia in type II diabetes mellitus, but sucrose is still restricted in dietary recommendations. Since sucrose in high carbohydrate diets elevates fasting triglyceride levels, the effects of sucrose were evaluated in diets with fixed carbohydrate levels. Eighteen diabetic volunteers receiving no medication were given weight maintenance diets with 50 percent carbohydrate, 35 percent fat, 15 percent protein, and 120 g of sucrose for 10 days as inpatients. They were then randomly assigned diets of similar composition with either 220 g of sucrose (high sucrose diet) or less than 3 g of sucrose daily (complex carbohydrate [CHO] diet) for one additional month. There were no differences in fasting, one-, two-, and three-hour post-lunch serum glucose levels; 24-hour glycosuria; glycohemoglobin levels; fasting and postprandial serum triglyceride levels, or fasting high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Twelve patients with preexisting higher triglyceridemia had similar trends, but the postprandial triglyceride levels were lower in the high sucrose diet group of this subset (p less than 0.05 in the third week). Postprandial serum insulin levels declined in the second week on the complex CHO diet. More than 75-fold difference in sucrose intake with constant carbohydrate and fat did not affect glycemic or triglyceridemic control in type II diabetic patients. The reported high sucrose-carbohydrate-induced rise in fasting triglyceridemia was not present when a diet high in sucrose was given without changing total carbohydrate.\r"

In addition, two more patients had other types of tumors. Thus, Kaposi's sarcoma represents 87.5 percent of tumors in the King Faisal Hospital renal transplant population, in contrast to 3.7 percent in the Cincinnati Transplant Tumor Registry. The mean period between transplantation and diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma was 12.5 months (range, one to 37 months). Eleven patients were Saudis and three were other Arab nationals. Seven of the 11 Saudi patients were from the southwestern region of the country. Cytomegalovirus titers were not elevated in six of 10 patients. Results of tests for human immunodeficiency virus were negative in seven of eight patients. HLA-A2 antigen frequency was significantly increased in the King Faisal Hospital renal transplant patients with Kaposi's sarcoma as compared with a control population (83.3 percent versus 43.6 percent, p value = 0.006 [P = 0.06 with Bonferroni adjustment]), and increased, though nonsignificantly, compared with the live related kidney transplant recipients without Kaposi's sarcoma (83.3 percent versus 49.4 percent, p value = 0.058 [P = 0.58 with Bonferroni adjustment]), suggesting a genetic predisposition to Kaposi's sarcoma in these patients.\r"

Primary infection can be prevented by serologic screening of blood and organ donors, and the use of leukocyte-depleted blood products deserves further study in this context. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis may be effective in reducing the severity of infection in some groups. Virus reactivation can be delayed or prevented by high-dose intravenous acyclovir, and results should be improved by use of newer agents with greater anti-CMV activity, such as ganciclovir and foscarnet. However, the bone marrow toxicity of ganciclovir may reduce its prophylactic potential. Recent results with combined antiviral chemotherapy are encouraging, and other approaches in the future will undoubtedly include use of either recombinant or subunit vaccines or adoptive immunotherapy with effector cells generated in vitro for clinical use.\r"

Treatment with chemotherapy or irradiation is recommended in EBV-associated B cell lymphomas seen in immunosuppressed, transplanted, and human immunodeficiency virus-I seropositive patients. No effect of acyclovir has been reported, but such therapy may be considered in the early stage when EBV induces a polyclonal B cell activation. Acyclovir treatment is effective in the EBV-genome positive hairy leukoplakia in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients. No effect of antiviral therapy has been reported in the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. Prophylactic use of immunoglobulin or acyclovir has been suggested in susceptible children.\r"

Treatment must be for three months on an alternate-day basis; on this regimen, at least one third of patients will develop clinical and biochemical evidence of an exacerbation of hepatitis followed by rapid clearance from serum of all markers of viral replication, and in some cases, also of hepatitis B surface antigen. A large proportion of carriers remains insensitive to alpha-interferons, however, and studies based on the combination of interferons with other agents that have proved less effective, but with different modes of action, are in progress and appear promising.\r"

Currently, a randomized controlled trial of human lymphoblastoid interferon, with or without prednisolone pretreatment, versus placebo in patients with hepatitis B core antigen in the liver and hepatitis B e antigen in the serum is being conducted. Forty-five patients (29 receiving interferon, 16 receiving placebo) have been entered in the trial for at least two months. Actuarial analysis shows that the response to interferon therapy was better than that to placebo. Although flu-like symptoms, hair loss, and body weight loss were seen, no side effect requiring specific treatment has been encountered. These preliminary results suggest that human lymphoblastoid interferon is effective and safe in Oriental patients.\r"

HBe reactivation occurred in two patients with cirrhosis. Hepatitis B surface seroconversion followed HBe seroconversion in 11 to 30 percent of treated patients. HBe seroconversion was significantly related to initial low levels of viral replication and to transient aminotransferase elevation during the second half of the interferon treatment of 16 weeks. Clinical improvement and persistent normalization of aspartate aminotransferase was observed in all patients with HBe seroconversion. Conversion to a state of virus latency (HBe negative) mostly occurred after therapy, suggesting that the specific immunologic host response had been brought about by the suppression of virus replication through antiviral agents. Recommendations for selection of patients for antiviral combination therapy are made on the basis of these long-term results.\r"

In humans, over 50 distinct human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have now been recognized, and each is associated with a specific set of clinical lesions. Approximately 15 of these viruses have been associated with benign proliferative lesions of the genital tract, and a subset of these has been regularly associated with vulvar, penile, and cervical lesions that are generally regarded as precancerous. The regular presence of these same HPV DNAs in cancers of the cervix, penis, and vulva has supported the notion that these HPVs may have an etiologic role in these malignancies. The biology and natural history of HPV infections are poorly understood. In addition to the clinically apparent lesions induced, HPV-DNA can often persist latently in tissues that appear entirely normal. The cellular, hormonal, immune, and other physiologic factors involved in determining whether or not a HPV infection will be clinically manifest are not known. In general, there is a paucity of information concerning the host cellular and humoral immune responses to a HPV infection, though clinical observations indicate that such responses probably play a major role in the resolution of HPV-associated diseases.\r"

All three have been tested in clinical trials in condylomata acuminata, or genital warts, with positive results. Administration by topical, intralesional, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes results in regression of human papillomavirus genital disease. Significant reduction in measurable lesions occurs in some patients within days of initiation of therapy. Responses appear to be both time and dose dependent. Although disease resolution is highly variable from patient to patient, approximately 75 to 80 percent of all persons show clear clinical benefit at low doses. Biologic side effects of interferons are tolerated well at these doses and occur following systemic or local administration of interferon. In general, the interferons are emerging as active and safe therapeutic agents for genital human papillomavirus infections. This study reviews in detail the series of clinical trials conducted with one of these agents, interferon alpha n1. Results of four small and two major controlled trials in refractory genital warts have proved that this interferon provides significant clinical benefit for the majority of subjects with severe disease. Current studies show that it can be combined safely and effectively with other conventional treatment modalities, such as laser or podophyllin.\r"

Most of these therapies can be divided into two major groups: (1) The first group includes agents with antiretroviral properties: nucleoside analogues, such as 2'-3'-dideoxycytidine and ribavirin, suramin, antimoniotungstate (heteropolyanion-23), foscarnet (phosphonoformate), interferons, peptide T, castanospermine, dextran sulfate, AL721, or ampligen.

Using this recombinant material the RT has been purified and crystallized. Crystallographic studies currently underway are aimed at elucidating the three-dimensional structure of HIV RT. The availability of a bacterial expression system has enabled structural/functional studies of the RT by site-directed mutagenesis. These studies have identified amino acid residues that are essential for activity of the enzyme and might be involved in substrate binding. It is hoped that structural information of this nature will allow the rational design of HIV RT inhibitors.\r"

With the exception of Epstein-Barr virus, all non-retroviruses tested so far have been insensitive to inhibition by zidovudine. In vivo, efficacy of zidovudine was demonstrated against Rauscher murine leukemia virus and feline leukemia virus. In both experimental models, infections completely resolved in animals when the drug was administered soon after infection. These results suggest that prompt initiation of zidovudine therapy, following a known exposure to HIV, should be considered. Mechanism studies show that zidovudine is phosphorylated to the monophosphate and diphosphate derivatives by the host cell cytosolic thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase, respectively. The identity of the enzyme that phosphorylates zidovudine diphosphate is not known, but is believed to be the cellular nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate of zidovudine appears to be the active form of the drug. Zidovudine triphosphate competes well with thymidine 5'-triphosphate for binding to the HIV reverse transcriptase and also functions as an alternative substrate. Incorporation of zidovudine monophosphate results in chain termination. However, it is not clear which mechanism, chain termination or competition with thymidine 5'-triphosphate, or a combination of both, is responsible for the inhibition of HIV replication.\r"

The increased availability of zidovudine and its licensure in many countries have resulted in its widespread use. With these developments have come a multitude of new questions. How long will clinical benefit be sustained? Will zidovudine be useful in asymptomatic HIV carriers and in other HIV-related conditions? How can the diversion of zidovudine to unproven indications be averted so that properly controlled clinical trials are conducted? Can better treatment regimens be developed to enhance the therapeutic/toxic ratio of zidovudine? What are the proper roles of governments in assuring patient access to zidovudine? How should newer anti-HIV drugs be compared with zidovudine? Will combinations of zidovudine and other active agents be useful? To address many of these issues in the United States, the Federal Government has established an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) program. Over 3,000 patients have been enrolled in AIDS Clinical Trials Group trials, which span the spectrum from asymptomatic to advanced HIV-I infections. In addition, drug development and screening programs have been established to evaluate new compounds and regimens. Although control of AIDS will be a long and arduous journey, an important beginning has been made.\r"

In subacute intravenous toxicity studies, no significant toxicologic alterations were seen in rats or dogs. In cynomolgus monkeys, which as in humans rapidly and extensively glucuronidate zidovudine, a reversible, dose-related, macrocytic anemia was seen in animals given 35, 100, or 300 mg/kg per day for three or six months. In three-month and six-month oral toxicity studies in rats, treatment-related alterations consisted of a mild increase in glucose level in the blood in female rats in both studies and a reversible, slight-to-mild macrocytic anemia in the six-month study. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or rabbits given the drug during gestation. Results for zidovudine were negative in a bacterial mutagenicity assay, but the drug was weakly mutagenic at concentrations of 1,000 to 5,000 micrograms/ml in mammalian cells. Zidovudine caused chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes at concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml and higher and had positive results in a cell transformation assay at concentrations of 0.5 micrograms/ml and higher. No bone marrow chromosomal alterations were noted in a cytogenetics study in rats given zidovudine at several intravenous dose levels up to 300 mg/kg.\r"

The case definition has now been revised. Most children with AIDS acquired their infection perinatally and have a parent with established AIDS-related complex or AIDS or belong to a high-risk group. Prior to March 1985, children also acquired human immunodeficiency virus from a contaminated blood product transfusion or from factor replacement for hemophilia. In the United States, AIDS in children occurs predominantly in cities with large populations of intravenous drug users. There are a number of differences between the clinical manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection in children compared with adults. For example, recurrent bacterial infection is more common in children, perhaps reflecting the abnormal B cell function that occurs relatively early in the disease course. Certain opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis) are less common in children than adults. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia does not occur in adults but is found in 30 to 50 percent of children. On the other hand, Kaposi's sarcoma and other malignancies are less common in children. Treatment has consisted largely of general supportive care in hospital or at home; this is dependent on the availability and utilization of resources and financial support. However, as anti-retroviral therapy becomes available, studies in children have been initiated. It is hoped that in the future it may be possible to prevent the disease; in the meantime, earlier diagnosis and better therapy are important goals.\r"

Two hundred twenty-nine patients who participated in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine were enrolled in an open-label study.

Survival rates of zidovudine-treated patients were higher than those that might have been expected from previous experience with similar patients. Patients continued to experience episodes of opportunistic infections; however, these infections were either of decreased severity or were more responsive to conventional therapy. The increase in median CD4 cell counts that occurred initially was followed by a gradual decline to near baseline values. Hematologic toxicities continued to be the major laboratory abnormality associated with drug administration; however, new or more frequent toxicity was not observed with more prolonged therapy. Progressive bone marrow suppression did not appear to be associated with prolonged administration. Overall, patients originally enrolled in the double-blind trial continued to receive clinical benefit from zidovudine therapy.\r"

The introduction of antiviral therapy has improved the outcome for patients with life-threatening disease. Neonatal HSV infection is usually acquired at the time of delivery by contact of the fetus with infected maternal genital secretions resulting in disease that can be localized to the skin, eye, and mouth, and can lead to encephalitis or become disseminated. A total of 291 babies with neonatal HSV infection have been evaluated over a period of 14 years with mortality and morbidity rates determined at one year. Vidarabine therapy decreased the incidence of mortality and improved morbidity rates; however, further improvement in mortality rates with acyclovir therapy has not been apparent. No significant clinical toxicity appeared in either treatment group. In order to improve outcome, earlier intervention and prophylactic strategies must be developed. For patients with herpes simplex encephalitis, acyclovir therapy is superior to vidarabine therapy for biopsy-proven disease. When outcome is compared for 136 vidarabine- and 46 acyclovir-treated, biopsy-proven patients, mortality rates are decreased to 20 percent with acyclovir, and approximately 40 percent of survivors are evaluated as normal at one year after therapy. Despite better outcome with antiviral therapy for the treatment of biopsy-proven herpes simplex encephalitis, further improvement is required.\r"

New lesions form in most immunocompromised children for longer than five days and those not treated with antiviral drugs have a 28 percent incidence of pneumonitis and a 7 percent mortality rate. Untreated immunocompromised adults with herpes zoster shed virus for longer (7.0 days) than otherwise normal adults (5.3 days). Herpes zoster is much more likely to disseminate cutaneously in immunocompromised than in immunocompetent hosts. Visceral dissemination, which is a rare event in immunocompetent patients, occurred in 8 percent of prospectively followed untreated immunocompromised hosts with herpes zoster. Acyclovir has been found to be superior to vidarabine for treatment of both chickenpox and herpes zoster. Whether or not steroids should be used to treat herpes zoster remains controversial. Concerns about the use of intravenous acyclovir include the side effects of renal and central nervous system dysfunction and the possibility of emergence of resistant viral strains. None of these concerns has proved to be an impediment to successful treatment of immunocompromised patients. The major future challenge is to find an optimal way to treat varicella zoster virus infections with oral formulations of acyclovir or its congeners.\r"

Both idoxuridine and acyclovir have been investigated in placebo-controlled double-blind studies.

Compared with placebo recipients, recipients of the high-dosage acyclovir experienced a significantly shortened period of viral shedding, significantly accelerated time to 50 percent scabbing, significantly accelerated time to 50 percent healing, and after two days of therapy, significantly less frequent formation of new lesions. The duration and severity of acute pain were less in acyclovir recipients, with differences in pain severity achieving statistical significance (p = 0.03) between Days 3 and 10 and correlating with the treatment differences in new lesion formation. In studies of the 400 mg five times per day dose schedule, differences between acyclovir and placebo recipients were not significant. In a six-month follow-up of recipients in the higher dosage study, the acyclovir recipients experienced less post-zoster pain than placebo recipients; differences in the prevalence of pain were most significant for the presence of a persistent pain in the first three months of follow-up. Oral acyclovir at these dosages appears to be free of adverse reactions. In summary, oral acyclovir at a dosage of 800 mg five times per day for 10 days for treatment of acute herpes zoster is superior to 400 mg five times per day and favorably alters the course of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Both acyclovir and vidarabine are effective treatment for varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in immunosuppressed patients. To determine which is preferable, therapy with these two agents was compared in a prospective, randomized trial. A total of 22 immunocompromised patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies and presenting with VZV infection within 72 hours of the onset of rash were randomly assigned to receive intravenous acyclovir or vidarabine; 11 patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group. Acyclovir was significantly more effective than vidarabine in preventing complications of VZV infection, and treatment failures requiring a change to the alternate therapy occurred only among those treated with vidarabine. As compared with vidarabine, acyclovir shortened the median period during which results of viral culture specimens were positive and new lesions formed. Acyclovir also shortened the median interval until the first decrease in pain, the crusting of all lesions, and the complete healing of lesions. Acyclovir is more effective than vidarabine in the treatment of VZV infection in severely immunocompromised patients and should be considered the treatment of choice in such cases.\r"

  ".W": "Following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, herpes zoster infections that are potentially severe with a high risk of dissemination develop in 30 to 50 percent of patients. Intravenous acyclovir is an effective treatment for established zoster in immunocompromised persons. Oral acyclovir has relatively low bioavailability, which has made the value of this route of administration for the treatment or prophylaxis of herpes zoster infections uncertain. In this trial, 82 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous acyclovir for 23 days followed by oral acyclovir for six months, or matched placebos; the random groups were well-matched in all clinical characteristics. During the six-month period of acyclovir/placebo administration, no patient receiving acyclovir developed herpes zoster, whereas six patients receiving placebo did so (p = 0.006). During the six-month follow-up, there were six cases of zoster in the treatment arm of the study and two cases in the placebo arm. Herpes zoster was not restricted to those patients who had positive evidence of antibody before transplant. This study shows that oral acyclovir is capable of preventing zoster infection during its period of administration; once the drug treatment is stopped, infections occur. In selected patients, the use of long-term oral acyclovir may be of value in preventing zoster infections during the time of greatest immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated all respiratory complications of cardiac transplantation in a 10-year study of 94 consecutive recipients. Mean follow-up time was 20 +/- 17 months. The initial 20 patients were treated with azathioprine and prednisone, while the subsequent 74 patients received cyclosporine and prednisone. In the azathioprine group, respiratory infections accounted for 24 of 60 (40%) infections. Two-thirds of the respiratory infections occurred in the first 3 postoperative months and were generally localized processes (focal pneumonitis, nodule(s), abscess, or empyema). Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (8/30) and aspergillus (8/30) were the predominant pathogens. Respiratory failure occurred in 29% of infectious episodes. In the cyclosporine group, there were significantly fewer respiratory infections. There was also a reduction in the number of nonrespiratory infections; hence, the percentage of total infections due to respiratory causes, 26 of 50 (52%), was not significantly different. In contrast, however, nearly two-thirds of the respiratory infections in cyclosporine-treated patients occurred after the first 3 postoperative months, and were usually diffuse processes. Despite diffuse disease, respiratory failure was observed with similar frequency (19%). Pneumocystis carinii (9/31) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (7/31) were the predominant pathogens. CMV pneumonitis tended to occur earlier than that due to P. carinii (2.9 +/- 1.9 mo vs. 9.8 +/- 11.2 mo, respectively), but there was considerable overlap. In comparison with infectious processes, there were 50% fewer noninfectious respiratory complications in both groups. These were primarily pleural (46%) or thromboembolic (18%) disorders. Four of five pulmonary emboli occurred in patients with intercurrent cardiorespiratory illness, and were detected only at autopsy. The authors conclude that respiratory infections account for one-half of all infections observed in cardiac transplant recipients, despite the reduced infection rate associated with the use of cyclosporine. Furthermore, respiratory infections in cyclosporine-treated patients exhibit different clinical and etiologic features than those seen in azathioprine-treated patients. Finally, occult thromboemboli may be difficult to recognize in cardiac transplant recipients because of the high incidence of coexisting cardiorespiratory disease.\r"

Because the oral form of terbutaline is more widely utilized, a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial of the cardiopulmonary effects of oral terbutaline was conducted in ten patients with COPD. Right and left ventricular ejection fractions (RVEF and LVEF) were determined by first pass radionuclide angiography. There were no differences in spirometry and hemodynamic measurements between treatment and placebo days. Following 5 mg of oral terbutaline, there was a small but statistically significant increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and in heart rate, but no significant change in forced vital capacity or blood pressure. LVEF improved significantly with terbutaline both at rest (62% +/- 6% vs. 67% +/- 9%, mean +/- SD) and during submaximal steady state exercise (61% +/- 5% vs. 67% +/- 10%). RVEF improved significantly at rest (64% +/- 6% vs. 69% +/- 5%), but not during submaximal steady state exercise (65% +/- 6% vs. 68% +/- 7%). Thus, oral terbutaline produces significant improvement in biventricular systolic pump performance at rest, and increases left ventricular ejection fraction during submaximal exercise in patients with moderate to severe COPD.\r"

  ".U": "88307464\r", 
  ".W": "Gallstone disease is a common disease that appears to be related to a Western diet. The underlying pathogenesis is a subtle alteration in the liver such that excessive cholesterol is extracted from the liver cell by bile acids undergoing an enterohepatic recirculation. Gallstone disease progresses through well-defined stages, beginning with a bile supersaturated with cholesterol and proceeding to crystal formation, stone growth, and finally symptoms caused by impaction of a stone in either the cystic duct or the common bile duct. The natural history is that most stones never cause symptoms. Stones that cause symptoms have been present for an average of 12 years. The treatment of truly asymptomatic stones should be observation. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant is the gold standard for the diagnosis of stones in the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of stones in the common bile duct. Oral cholecystogram (OCG) helps select patients who have noncalcified, floating stones that may be dissolved with bile acids or methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). Therapy with chenodiol has been a disappointment because of a low complete response rate. The ideal candidate for attempted dissolution with chenodiol would be a thin woman with hypercholesterolemia and a small number of symptomatic, small, floating, radiolucent gallstones. Ursodeoxycholic acid (Urso), when it is available, will have all of the attributes of chenodiol and virtually none of the side effects. Rapid dissolution of gallstones with MTBE shows great promise of being a generally available means of dissolving gallstones. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy also shows promise, but its general availability may be limited by the cost of the equipment needed. As of now, the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones remains cholecystectomy, unless there is a compelling reason not to operate.\r"

Steroid receptors are the most reliable predictor of hormonal responsiveness. Lymph node involvement is crucial in determining the extent of the disease and the need for adjuvant therapy.

The value of a second-trimester mean arterial blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg was reviewed in 39,876 reported cases of preeclampsia and 207 cases of eclampsia. The sensitivity ranged from 0% to 92% and the specificity varied from 53% to 97%. The predictive value of a positive test ranged from 0% to 43% and the predictive value of a negative test ranged from 76% to 98%. The predictive value of a positive test was not greatly higher than the incidence of hypertension in the whole population studied in the majority of the reports. There was a strong association of higher second-trimester mean arterial blood pressure in nulliparous women with eclampsia who had transient hypertension in later gestations and ultimately developed chronic hypertension. The data suggest that one sign of future chronic hypertension, that is, transient hypertension, is often predicted by high second-trimester mean arterial blood pressure, which may have the same significance. We think that if increased second-trimester mean arterial blood pressure levels predict anything, it is transient hypertension rather than preeclampsia-eclampsia.\r"

Its sensitivity ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 and specificity ranges from 0.95 to 1.00 for diagnosing male infertility. For predicting in vitro fertilization failures, its sensitivity varies from 0.00 to 0.78 and specificity ranges from 0.51 to 1.00. The reproducibility of this assay is not clear, and there is little standardization of methods between laboratories. Until the validity and reproducibility of the sperm penetration assay have been established, this expensive test should probably not be used to evaluate infertile couples.\r"

Sodium excretion did not differ significantly between pregnancy and after pregnancy despite marked differences in plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration, volume, and glomerular filtration rate. Sodium excretion after saline solution loading varied according to prestudy sodium intake and was reduced between the second and third trimesters, independent of dietary salt intake. Those destined to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension had sodium excretion similar to that of continuously normotensive subjects during the second trimester, but those with established proteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension had the lowest plasma volume, plasma aldosterone concentration, and plasma renin activity and retained sodium to the same degree as salt-deplete women with normotension. These results demonstrate that the balance of sodium regulatory factors is similar between pregnancy and post partum, that prestudy salt intake and stage of gestation can alter the natriuretic response to saline solution loading, and that normal pregnant women retain more administered sodium in late pregnancy than in midpregnancy despite further increases in plasma volume and no alterations to blood pressure or glomerular filtration rate. Those with established proteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension retain sodium avidly without stimulation of plasma renin activity or plasma aldosterone concentration, findings not apparent during midpregnancy in those who later developed this disorder.\r"

Forty-five subjects between 20 and 36 weeks' gestation received either intravenous (n = 24) or intramuscular (n = 21) therapy. Successful tocolysis occurred in 14 of 21 (67%) patients in the group treated intramuscularly and in 16 of 24 (67%) patients in the group treated intravenously. A greater mean dose (8.6 versus 3.3 mg/hour) and a higher mean serum concentration (38.9 versus 24.7 micrograms/ml) were needed to achieve successful tocolysis in the intravenous group as compared with the intramuscular group. Patients who did not respond to tocolytic therapy in both groups had levels of ritodrine in the blood either equivalent to or greater than those of subjects who were successfully treated. Analysis of ritodrine levels in the successfully treated intramuscular group demonstrated significant differences in blood levels depending on muscle group used. These differences can be at least partially attributed to higher mean doses administered to patients receiving vastus lateralis injections as compared with those receiving gluteal muscle injections. The results suggest that intramuscular administration of ritodrine is an efficacious and safe route of drug delivery. Additional studies are needed to better define dose-response curves for the intramuscular administration of ritodrine hydrochloride.\r"

There was no difference in lecithin phosphorus concentration (index of fetal lung maturity) among the three groups. The amniotic fluid insulin level was significantly higher in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, whereas there was no difference in amniotic fluid prolactin levels among the groups. Correlations of amniotic fluid prolactin levels with both lecithin phosphorus and insulin levels were not statistically significant in any of the groups. This is probably because amniotic fluid prolactin is decidual, rather than fetal, in origin. Even though amniotic fluid insulin levels, which reflect fetal levels, were significantly higher in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, there was no difference in the amniotic fluid lecithin phosphorus concentration in diabetic pregnancies compared with that in normal pregnancies. Moreover, there was a positive, and not a negative, correlation between amniotic fluid insulin and amniotic fluid lecithin phosphorus levels in diabetic pregnancies. These results do not support the theory that fetal hyperinsulinemia results in delayed pulmonic maturation in diabetic pregnancies.\r"

One thousand one hundred fifty-four amniotic fluid samples were tested for acetylcholinesterase and alpha-fetoprotein; the rate of an inconclusive acetylcholinesterase result was 3.3% (38 of 1154). Fourteen such results were found in patients with a high amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein level (23.3%), and 24 results were associated with normal amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels (2.19%). The rates of congenital fetal malformation associated with an inconclusive acetylcholinesterase result in the two groups were 57.14% and 37.5%, respectively. In amniotic fluid samples obtained before 15 weeks' gestation, there was a higher rate of inconclusive acetylcholinesterase tests (9.29%), but a lower percentage of malformed fetuses were found compared with later in pregnancy (2.46% and 56%, respectively). Thus we suggest the terminology \"equivocal\" for early specimens and \"suspicious\" for later specimens. If obtained in early second trimester and the ultrasound scan is normal, such findings implicate the need for a careful search for fetal malformations. A positive pregnancy outcome may be expected in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "Presumably, a large number of recurrent abortions are caused by lethal recessive syndromes whose diagnosis depends either on a known family history or on the identification of characteristic fetal phenotypic features on pathologic examination. Because these conditions are rare, family histories are seldom helpful, and nondirected postmortem examinations on degenerating samples are seldom enlightening. Serial ultrasonography beginning early in pregnancy may provide important information in the evaluation of recurrent abortion caused by lethal recessive disorders. Reported is the accurate prenatal sonographic diagnosis of lethal multiple pterygium syndrome in a patient with a history of recurrent abortions. This syndrome is characterized by multiple limb contractures with pterygia, facial clefting, intracranial abnormalities, cystic hygroma, progressive fetal edema, and fetal death by midgestation. Inheritance may be X-linked recessive. Lethal multiple pterygium syndrome should be considered in patients with a history of recurrent midtrimester losses.\r"

Reproduction is possible for both male and female patients after the transplant. Counseling for contraception when sterilization is not desired must take into account the increased risk of infection and genital carcinoma associated with immunosuppressant drug therapy. Teratogenicity has not been reported either with traditional immunosuppressive agents (prednisone, azathioprine) or with cyclosporine. Osteoporosis prophylaxis is particularly important in the female heart transplant recipient, because the chronic use of prednisone increases this risk. Guidelines are provided to counsel patients in these areas.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of vitamin B12 R-binder in the uterus was studied by use of an immunoperoxidase technique. Positive staining by anti-R-binder antiserum was observed in the columnar epithelium of the endocervix (18/18 cases) and in the surface epithelium of the endometrium (8/21 cases). Staining was usually seen in the apical portion of the epithelium; cytoplasmic staining in the endocervical columnar epithelium was intense. The secretory products in the endocervical glands showed positive staining. The endometrial glandular epithelium did not stain (0/24 cases). Metaplastic squamous epithelium of the endocervix showed positive staining (3/18 cases). The native squamous epithelium as well as the stromal components of the cervix, endometrium, and myometrium were negative for R-binder. This study shows that R-binder is localized in the uterus, especially in the endocervical glands. The R-binder in the endocervix may have antimicrobial activity in the uterus as in other organs, such as the intestines and mammary glands.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular localization of angiotensin II immunoreactivity and the presence of angiotensin II binding in rat ovaries were studied. Angiotensin II immunohistochemical staining was demonstrated throughout the corpora lutea of gonadotropin-stimulated immature rats and pseudopregnant adult rats, as well as in some stromal and thecal cells surrounding large antral follicles. No immunostaining was observed in granulosa cells of preantral or antral rat follicles or in ovaries from unstimulated immature rats. With in vitro autoradiography, specific, saralasin-suppressible 125I-angiotensin II binding was demonstrated in normal cycling rat ovaries: diestrus greater than proestrus greater than estrus. The combined findings of angiotensin II immunostaining in ovarian follicles and corpora lutea and of cycle-related angiotensin II binding support the hypothesis of a functional role for the ovarian renin-angiotensin system.\r"
