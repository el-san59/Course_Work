  ".W": "The importance of personality traits in nonulcer dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome is a controversial issue. We wished to assess the distribution of abnormal personality traits in nonulcer dyspepsia and the irritable bowel syndrome, define any relation among personality and symptoms, and determine whether personality factors discriminate among patients with functional, psychiatric, or organic gastrointestinal diseases. Patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (n = 31), irritable bowel syndrome (n = 67), organic gastrointestinal disease (n = 64), somatoform disorder (n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 128) were studied. Before diagnostic evaluation by an independent physician, all patients completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and a symptom questionnaire. Symptom scores for abdominal pain and the Manning criteria, which is considered to be diagnostic for the irritable bowel syndrome, were evaluated. Personality scales in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and organic disease were very similar. However, patients in the other groups differed from somatoform disorder on nearly all scales. In nonulcer dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and organic disease, hypochondriasis weakly correlated with pain. Subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome patients with predominant constipation and those with predominant diarrhea had similar personality traits, although hypomania was minimally increased in constipation. Patients who fulfilled the Manning criteria for irritable bowel syndrome had more psychological distress than those who did not. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory correctly classified somatoform disorder and health 81% and 75% of the time, respectively, but it classified nonulcer dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome correctly in only 32% and 34% of cases. Our results suggest that psychopathology may not be the major explanation for functional gastrointestinal disorders.\r"

In the studies, indomethacin caused acute gastroduodenal damage in 100% of cases, with maximal damage at 24 hours of administration. With continued intake this damage resolves, although a minority (two study subjects) progressed to discrete ulceration. Why these two subjects failed to adapt is unknown. Biopsy specimens taken during the studies showed no significant changes in inflammatory or regenerative features, and thus failed to shed any light on this process of adaptation to damage. Mucosal pH gradient studies showed a significant increase in juxtamucosal pH at the time of maximal damage (24 hours); this is thought to represent passive diffusion of alkali from damaged mucosa. In conclusion, mucosal adaptation to acute damage by indomethacin occurs in humans. The mechanisms through which the mucosa adapts in this intriguing way remain unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The central nervous system effects of somatostatin-28 on proximal duodenal bicarbonate secretion were studied in freely moving rats. Cerebroventricular administration of somatostatin-28 (0.2-2.0 nmol) significantly stimulated duodenal bicarbonate secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Somatostatin-28 was approximately twice as effective as somatostatin-14. Intravenous administration of somatostatin-28 or somatostatin-14 did not significantly alter the bicarbonate response. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine and truncal vagotomy abolished the stimulatory effect of somatostatin-28 while bretylium, naloxone, indomethacin, and adrenalectomy did not. Furthermore, atropine methylnitrate significantly attenuated and the vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist 4Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17-vasoactive intestinal peptide abolished the bicarbonate response produced by cerebroventricular somatostatin-28. In contrast, hypophysectomy and pretreatment with the vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist [1-deaminopenicillamine, 2-(0-methyl)Tyr, 8-Arg]-vasopressin significantly enhanced the bicarbonate response produced by cerebroventricular somatostatin-28. These findings indicate that somatostatin-28 acts within the central nervous system to stimulate duodenal bicarbonate secretion in freely moving rats via vagal efferents by release of vasoactive intestinal peptide and, in part, by a muscarinic pathway and not by catecholamine, opiate, or prostaglandin release.\r"

  ".U": "90306688\r", 
  ".W": "The optimal degree and duration of suppression of gastric acidity required for the healing of peptic ulcers has never been established. Although very potent inhibitors of acid secretion are now available, the need for this degree of suppression has not been shown, and there is a possibility of adverse effects because of pronounced acid inhibition. Therefore, a model has been constructed that defines the relationship between duodenal ulcer healing and antisecretory therapy. Acid suppression data were obtained directly from investigators as raw data from 24-hour studies of acid secretion. Twenty-one experiments from seven investigators provided 490 24-hour studies using 19 different treatment regimens. Healing data were collected from a metaanalysis of published clinical trials of duodenal ulcer healing. A total of 144 published trials in 14,208 patients provided healing data at several endoscopic endpoints for the 19 drug regimens for which acidity data were provided. Weighted least-squares polynomial regression analysis was used to define those parameters of antisecretory therapy that contributed most to duodenal ulcer healing and to define the shape of the response surface. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.9814) was found between healing and the degree of acid suppression, the duration of acid suppression, and the length of therapy. The shape of the contour expression this relationship shows that healing increases as the duration of suppression increases and as gastric pH increases. However, suppression that increased pH beyond 3.0 was not found to increase ulcer healing further. It is concluded that a longer duration of antisecretory effect and/or a longer duration of therapy are of greater importance than potency for duodenal ulcer healing.\r"

  ".W": "Gastric Helicobacter mustelae was present in 100% of 11 adult female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). The high immunoglobulin G antibody levels to H. mustelae in all ferrets showed a significant immune response to the organism. Urease mapping of the ferret stomach indicated that the bacteria heavily colonized the proximal duodenum and antrum and, to a lesser extent, the corpus. The histological gastritis observed coincided with presence of H. mustelae. Superficial gastritis was noted in the oxyntic gastric mucosa, whereas in the distal antrum the chronic inflammatory response occupied the full thickness of the mucosa. In the proximal antrum and transitional mucosa, focal glandular atrophy and regeneration were observed. Seven control specific-pathogen-free ferrets were not colonized with the bacteria, did not have detectable levels of immunoglobulin G H. mustelae antibody, and did not have H. mustelae-associated gastritis. The ferret lacks the polymorphonuclear-cell response seen in active chronic gastritis typically described with Helicobacter pylori gastritis in humans. However, the lesion in ferrets does closely resemble the diffuse antral gastritis seen in a subset of adults with H. pylori gastritis as well as children infected with H. pylori. Like H. pylori, H. mustelae adheres tightly to gastric mucosa. The ferret infected with H. mustelae, in addition to specific-pathogen-free uninfected control ferrets, will make longitudinal studies possible, enabling dissection of multiple host and environmental variables that influence the effect of H. mustelae colonization on progression and severity of gastroduodenal disease.\r"

  ".U": "90306691\r", 
  ".W": "Tyrosine phosphorylation has recently been recognized as a unique system involved in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. The role of tyrosine kinase activity in regulating intestinal proliferation has received little attention. The aim of this study was to document the presence of tyrosine kinase activity in intestinal microvillus membranes and to characterize the major endogenous tyrosine kinase substrates in microvillus membranes. Microvillus membranes, prepared from 21-day gestation fetal and adult CD rats by the calcium precipitation method, were solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with [32P]adenosine triphosphate and (Glu80Tyr20)n, which is a heterogeneous population of synthetic peptides containing glutamate and tyrosine. Fetal, and to a lesser extent adult, microvillus membranes were shown to phosphorylate (Glu80Tyr20)n assayed by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 32P incorporation as well as autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Preliminary identification of the endogenous substrates of microvillus membrane tyrosine kinase activity was determined by three techniques. First, phosphorylated microvillus membrane proteins were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resultant gel was incubated in 1 mol/L KOH at 55 degrees C to selectively retain phosphotyrosine proteins. The patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation were dissimiliar in fetal and adult microvillus membranes; specifically, two major bands, 80 and 190 kilodaltons, were present in fetal microvillus membranes and were not prominent in adult microvillus membranes. These proteins were both phosphorylated on tyrosine residues as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis. Second, a specific antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate phosphotyrosine proteins from solubilized phosphorylated microvillus membranes. This antibody specifically immunoprecipitated proteins of molecular weights 36 and 68 from fetal and 33, 54, and 68 from adult microvillus membranes. Third, using a polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody, Western blot analysis showed that the 68-kilodalton protein is the most abundant phosphotyrosine protein in fetal and adult microvillus membranes. These data will focus new investigations into the cellular mechanisms of the regulation of intestinal growth, particularly the role of luminal factors that may modulate microvillus membrane tyrosine kinase, and thus modulate enterocyte proliferation, differentiation, and function.\r"

Data were abstracted from the medical records of 225 eligible patients at primary and secondary care level whose disease was diagnosed between 1977 and 1985. The total study group was randomly divided into two groups (group 1, n = 112; group 2, n = 113). Discriminant analysis was performed on data of patients in group 1. The resulting predictive model was then cross-validated on data of patients in group 2. The variables entered into the predictive model were identified using bivariate analysis. Results show that presence of abdominal mass, body temperature, absolute basophil and lymphocyte counts, aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen serum levels, and place of residence (urban, rural, or out of province) were the most useful variables for predicting hospitalization in the first 3 months (P for model = 0.0010; accuracy = 88%). Cross-validation on group 2 showed an accuracy of 80%, a positive predictive value of 62%, and a negative predictive value of 84%. This predictive model could be useful for counseling purposes on the primary or secondary care levels.\r"

  ".W": "A novel water-soluble dopamine-2 antagonist, N-[4-[2-(dimethylamino) ethoxy]benzyl]-3,4-dimethoxybenzamide hydrochloride (HSR-803) was synthesized and assayed for its gastrointestinal smooth muscle stimulating activity in vivo and in vitro. In the in vivo study, gastrointestinal contractile activity was measured by means of chronically implanted force transducers in conscious dogs; it was found that HSR-803 at 3.0 mg/kg IV probably stimulated gastric contractile force twice during the digestive state and significantly antagonized dopamine-(1.0 mg/kg per hour) inhibited gastric contractions in doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg IV. With a background IV infusion of HSR-803 at 3 mg/kg per hour, the contraction-stimulating activity of acetylcholine (0.05 mg/kg per minute) was greatly enhanced while the response to bethanechol was not changed. As a result, HSR-803 was found to have a strong anticholinesterase activity besides the antidopamine-2 activity; i.e., the anticholinesterase activity of HSR-803 at 3 mg/kg per hour was equivalent to that of neostigmine at 10 micrograms/kg per hour, and dopamine-2 antagonistic activity of HSR-803 was similar to that of domperidone on a weight basis. No symptom suggesting actions on the central nervous system was noticed in HSR-803 up to 10 mg/kg IV in conscious dogs. In the in vitro study, HSR-803 inhibited cholinesterase dose-dependently, and IC50 was 2.9 x 10(-6) mol/L, while those of neostigmine and domperidone were 2.3 x 10(-8) mol/L and 1.7 x 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. In conclusion, HSR-803 stimulates endogenous acetylcholine release by antagonizing the dopamine-2 receptor on the postsynaptic cholinergic neurons, and the anticholinesterase activity of HSR-803 may cause the released acetylcholine to accumulate at cholinergic receptor sites. Thus, HSR-803 is potentially capable of enhancing cholinergic activity in the gastrointestinal region.\r"

Rates for women were 3.2 times those for men, and rates for whites were 5.3 times those for blacks. Rates were highest among those aged 45-64 years. More than 2.6 million (1.6% of the population) were symptomatic at the time of the survey. Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1985, and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, 1987, documented between 2.4 and 3.5 million yearly visits to physicians by patients with irritable bowel syndrome and more than 2.2 million medications prescribed. Rates of hospitalization for women have fallen from 71.9 (per 100,000 population) in 1982 to 21.1 in 1987 based on data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey. A similar pattern was observed in data from the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities. The data support the impression that irritable bowel syndrome is a prevalent condition in the United States with significant impact on health care. Large-scale, population-based surveys using standard criteria are needed to estimate the true extent of irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

There was one infective complication of pregnancy (hepatitis B virus infection), but there were no congenital abnormalities or subsequent health problems in the children.

  ".W": "Intestinal smooth muscle cells play a major role in the stricture formation that complicates chronic intestinal inflammation, by proliferating and producing collagen. Transforming growth factor beta 1 has been identified as an important inflammatory mediator in the fibrotic response of human tissue to inflammation. To determine whether this mediator might be involved in intestinal fibrosis, the effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 on collagen production and proliferation by human intestinal smooth muscle cells was studied in vitro. Cells in the second passage were grown to subconfluence in medium containing 10% Nu-Serum (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), after which the concentration of Nu-Serum was decreased. Forty-eight hours later, transforming growth factor beta 1 was added to the culture medium to achieve concentrations of 1-500 pmol/L. After 24 hours exposure to the transforming growth factor beta 1, cellular collagen synthesis was determined by the uptake of [3H]proline into collagenase-sensitive protein. Transforming growth factor beta 1 caused a 100% increase in collagen production and a 40% increase in noncollagen protein production per cell, reflecting an increase in relative collagen synthesis of 58%. This effect was maximal at a concentration of 10 pmol/L. Epidermal growth factor, by comparison, had no significant effect on relative collagen synthesis. Transforming growth factor beta 1 caused a significant increase in the uptake of methylaminoisobutyric acid, a nonmetabolized amino acid analog, into the cells at 10 pmol/L. However, this effect was small (20% increase) compared with the effect on the uptake of proline into collagen (100% increase) at this concentration. When cell proliferation was examined by the uptake of [3H]thymidine, transforming growth factor beta 1 had no effect, whereas epidermal growth factor (1000 pmol/L) caused a 94% increase. Transforming growth factor beta 1 selectively augments collagen production by human intestinal smooth muscle cells in vitro. This effect is potent and is not related to effects on either cell proliferation or amino acid uptake. These data suggest that transforming growth factor beta 1 has an important role as an inflammatory mediator in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "90306702\r", 
  ".W": "The hepatic transport of ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, was characterized in the rat and hamster; its effect on bile flow and bile acid-induced biliary lipid secretion was also measured. In anesthetized rats with biliary fistulae, the Tmax was about 5 mumol.min-1.kg-1, and in the hamster the Tmax was about 1 mumol.min-1.kg-1. The compound was not biotransformed. At high secretion rates, the concentration of cephalosporin in bile increased to 27 mmol/L, a concentration far exceeding the solubility product of its calcium salt [2 x 10(-6) (mol/L)2], which precipitated from bile. In the rat, ceftriaxone induced choleresis (22 microL/mumol ceftriaxone, the expected value for a dianionic compound). In the isolated perfused rat liver, ceftriaxone had a fractional hepatic extraction rate averaging 3%; the compound was concentratively secreted into bile, the bile-perfusate ratio ranging from 35-250. Ceftriaxone inhibited phospholipid and cholesterol secretion induced by endogenous or exogenous bile acids; the rate of inhibition was linearly proportional to the canalicular secretion rate of ceftriaxone. Hepatic transport of ceftriaxone had no influence on hepatic secretion of ursodeoxycholyltaurine. In contrast, the net hepatic transport of ursodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholyltaurine, or cholyltaurine inhibited ceftriaxone transport in a dose-dependent manner. It is concluded that ceftriaxone and bile acids share a common mechanism for hepatic transport in the rat and also interact in the processes involved in biliary lipid secretion. Biliary secretion of unbiotransformed ceftriaxone occurs at high concentrations; secondary Ca2+ entry results in the formation of supersaturated canalicular bile and subsequent precipitation as a calcium salt in the biliary tract. These data explain the formation of biliary sludge that occurs in patients undergoing high-dose ceftriaxone therapy.\r"

Yet the origin, means of initiation, and significance of this hyperplasia are unknown. To clarify these issues we induced bile duct proliferation in rats by ligating the common bile duct and studied (a) hepatic incorporation of [3H]thymidine by histoautoradiography, (b) hepatic morphometry, (c) biliary tree volume using [3H]taurocholate as a marker of biliary transit time, (d) immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin no. 19, (e) the effect of indomethacin, and (f) the role of increased biliary pressure, in the absence of physiological and biochemical evidence of cholestasis, on [3H]thymidine incorporation by the bile-duct cells. The results have demonstrated that (a) the proliferating bile duct-like cells are products of the extant biliary epithelium and retain its characteristics; (b) bile duct cells divide irrespective of the size of the duct in which they are located and form a system with a lumen continuous with the preexisting one; (c) bile duct proliferation results mainly in elongation, not in circumferential enlargement or sprouting of side branches; (d) portal macrophage infiltration does not play a role in the hyperplastic reaction, and (e) increased biliary pressure is the initiating factor in bile duct cell division. Our results provide evidence that under the present conditions, ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes does not occur and there is no functioning stem cell for biliary epithelial growth segregated in any particular duct size or within the portal connective tissue.\r"

In rats sucrose-loaded by IP administration of sucrose, electron microscopy showed expansion of the vacuolar apparatus and numerous large lysosomelike structures in hepatocytes. Subcellular distribution studies showed that sucrose was sequestered in lysosomes. Compared with controls, sucrose-loaded rats had a 30% higher (P less than 0.01) bile flow with no change in biliary bile acid or electrolyte concentrations. Administration of colchicine ablated the sucrose-induced choleresis and resulted in parallel changes in biliary secretions of sucrose and lysosomal enzymes. Our data suggest that in the sucrose-loaded rat, the hepatocyte vacuolar apparatus may contribute significantly to bile formation by microtubule-dependent release of fluid into bile by exocytosis.\r"

Antibody to the X antigen was found in 11 of 17 (65%) patients and 17 of 40 (42%) woodchucks that were surface-antigen positive. In comparison, this antibody was found in 5 of 14 (36%) patients and in none of 4 woodchucks that were surface-antigen negative. In 5 of 6 patients showing seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen to antibody, antibody to X appeared at or near the time of seroconversion. In patients persistently positive for e antigen, X antibody often appeared when viral DNA became undetectable in the serum. In 14 of 17 (82%) woodchucks positive for antibody to X antigen, it also appeared near or after the time that viral DNA in serum disappeared. X antibodies were detected with great frequency only in populations with high frequencies of other hepatitis B virus markers. The results are consistent with the conclusion that antibody to X antigen is a marker of hepadnavirus infections that seems to be associated with a decrease in viral replication. Antibodies to the X antigen, then, may be a host response to the replication complex of the virus.\r"

Male homosexuals (n = 35) had significantly greater levels of DNA polymerase (P less than 0.05) and a trend toward higher hepatitis B virus DNA levels than heterosexuals (n = 39). Significantly greater DNA polymerase and hepatitis B virus DNA levels were observed in homosexuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus than in heterosexuals (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.01, respectively) or human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexuals (P less than 0.03 for both). Moreover, a trend was observed for higher grades of hepatitis B core antigen staining in the human immunodeficiency virus-infected population than in the human immunodeficiency virus-negative cohort. Hepatitis B virus DNA and DNA polymerase levels in the 74 patients were inversely related to total histological scores, and the degree of portal infiltrate and periportal necrosis bore an inverse relationship to peripheral markers of viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus-negative homosexuals and heterosexuals. Taken together, the data support the view that hepatitis B virus is not cytopathic because the amount of replicating virus does not directly correlate with the degree of histological activity.\r"

The incidence of biliary tract carcinoma in patients with choledochal cysts is 5-35 times greater than that of the general population. Factors responsible for the increased risk of carcinoma are unknown. The case of a young woman who underwent excision of a choledochal cyst 16 years after initial diagnosis and treatment by choledochocystduodenostomy is reported. Metaplasia of the epithelial lining of the cyst was found in the resected specimen. The relative composition of bile acids in cyst contents was as follows: lithocholate, 2%; deoxycholate, 88%; chenodeoxycholate, 5%; and cholate, 5%. Virtually all bile acids were recovered in unconjugated form. In contrast, the bile acid composition of hepatic bile was as follows: lithocholate, 0%; deoxycholate, 34%; chenodeoxycholate, 43%; and cholate, 23%. Bile acids were fully conjugated. These data suggest that stasis of bile within choledochal cysts contributes to bacterial overgrowth and generation of unconjugated secondary bile acids.\r"

To elucidate the cause of the duct disruption, pancreas specimens resected from three cases of massive pancreatic pleural effusion were investigated histopathologically. There was no evidence of either chronic or acute pancreatitis except focal fibrosis along a single dilated duct in the resected pancreas. From our study, the pathogenesis of pancreatic duct disruption is suggested as follows: (a) alcohol ingestion can induce focal acute inflammation on a single branch of the duct system and elicit protein plug formation; and (b) focal stenotic change occurs on this branch at a point near the main pancreatic duct, and transient obstruction can occur by means of the protein plugs. The \"upstream\" extent of this branch will then dilate until it ruptures. However, on the frequency of this atypical pancreatitis, we have no clues to mention.\r"

She underwent successful orthotopic liver transplant. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, with no evidence of rejection or recurrence of graft-vs.-host disease. As bone marrow transplantation is more widely used and survival improves, the number of patients with graft-vs.-host disease or venoocclusive disease resulting in cirrhosis is likely to increase. Hepatic transplantation should be considered for bone marrow transplant patients who develop end-stage liver disease.\r"

The 11 patients diagnosed after 1980 all had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic small intestinal biopsies. Gross endoscopic lesions were observed in 9 of the 11 patients and disappeared in 5 of 6 treated patients at 6 months. These lesions include erosions, yellow plaques, and a pale yellow shaggy mucosa. The latter two lesions are macroscopically suggestive of Whipple's disease. After endoscopic \"healing,\" periodic acid-Schiff-positive macrophages remained present in the endoscopic biopsies for years. The patients were followed for a median period of 4 years and 5 months. All patients were treated with antibiotics (eight tetracycline alone, four tetracycline + streptomycin + penicillin, and four trimethoprim). Five patients (four of the tetracycline alone group, none of the trimethoprim group) relapsed 2 to 11 years after the initial treatment.\r"

Reflux was induced by atropine infusion, and the amount of reflux was quantitated by pH monitoring. Endoscopic sclerosis was effective in preventing reflux induced by high-dose atropine.

Using a recently developed cytology brush for the biliary tree, detection of malignancy in strictures of the bile duct had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100%. Both cases of cholangiocarcinoma were diagnosed with cytology, as were 5 of 10 cases of pancreatic cancer. It is concluded that brush cytology is a diagnostically reliable, highly specific technique for malignant lesions encountered at ERCP.

At two centers, 157 patients were prospectively randomized to receive SF-ELS or PEG-ELS to assess adequacy of preparation, patient tolerance, weight changes, and various hematologic and biochemical parameters. Physician assessment of colon cleansing showed no difference between those patients receiving SF-ELS (N = 74) or PEG-ELS (N = 78). Eighty-two percent of all preps were found to be \"clinically acceptable.\" Subjects receiving SF-ELS had significantly less fullness and cramps, while PEG-ELS subjects reported less nausea. There was no difference between groups for vomiting, overall discomfort, or willingness to repeat the preparation received. Eighty percent of all patients would repeat the randomized cleansing methods. There were no clinically significant changes in weight or assessed laboratory parameters, with the exception of potassium where PEG-ELS patients had an mean decrease of 0.22 mEq/liter vs. 0.01 mEq/liter for SF-ELS (p less than or equal to 0.01). Patient taste questionnaires in those patients expressing a preference showed a preference for SF-ELS (76.6%) over PEG-ELS (23.4%) (p less than or equal to 0.001). Thirty-two (22.5%) of total respondents indicated no preference. We conclude that SF-ELS when compared with PEG-ELS is similarly a safe and effective method of colon cleansing for colonoscopy that is well tolerated. Patients prefer the taste of the new solution.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate eicosanoid formation during the development of experimental cholecystitis in cats. Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in the gallbladders of patients with cholecystitis and is known to be a cytolytic, membrane-damaging substance. Anesthetized cats underwent gallbladder perfusion with and without 1.5 mmol/L lysophosphatidylcholine. Additional experiments were performed when calcium ionophore were added to the perfusates and experiments were performed when cats were treated with indomethacin and underwent perfusion with lysophosphatidylcholine. Changes in the gallbladder were determined by evaluating mucosal water transport as measured by determining the changes in concentration in a nonabsorbable marker, by protein secretion and by beta-glucuronidase accumulation in gallbladder tissue as an index of inflammation. Eicosanoid formation was evaluated by measuring perfusate concentrations and gallbladder homogenate concentrations by radioimmunoassay of prostaglandin E, 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, leukotriene B4 and leukotriene C4. Lysophosphatidylcholine perfusion reversed the control patterns of absorption and produced water exsorption, produced an efflux of protein into the perfusate and increased beta-glucuronidase activity. These changes were accompanied by increased production of prostaglandin E and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha in gallbladder perfusate and homogenate. The concentration of leukotriene C4 in gallbladder effusate was increased by lysophosphatidylcholine when compared with control values. Indomethacin inhibited the protein efflux, decreased beta-glucuronidase levels and decreased prostaglandin E and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha formation when compared with values produced by lysophosphatidylcholine alone. Cyclooxygenase inhibition did not alter the secretion of water into the gallbladder or perfusate leukotriene C4 concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate critical genetic elements in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus DNA integration, a single integrant in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and one species of multiple integrants in hepatocytes, both obtained from the same patient, were compared structurally using molecular cloning techniques. Both hepatitis B virus integrants showed similar inverted repeat sequences consisting of two defective virus genomes. The recombination of viral DNAs seemed to be mediated by short regions of base homology near the direct repeat 1 and at other regions of the virus genomes in both integrants. The virus component in the junction with host DNAs was the cohesive end region in each identical end of the viral integrant in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in one end of the viral integrant in hepatocytes. The structure of the integrant in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was characterized by an inverted, duplicated conformation composed not only of integrated virus genomes but also of flanking cellular sequences. It was shown to be the so-called \"alpha dimer\" of satellite DNA. In contrast, the flanking, nonreiterated cellular DNA in the hepatocyte-derived clone did not show discernible rearrangement. These findings suggest that a common mechanism underlies the integration of hepatitis B virus DNA so that a similar organization of inverted repeat genomes is found in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in hepatocytes. The unstable nature of cellular DNA where DNA integration occurs may be important in generating chromosome alterations found in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

The established cell line is negative for alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen; it has retained in vitro some of the differentiated functions of normal hepatocytes. Additionally, it presents a distinctive rearrangement (translocation) at the long arm of chromosome 4. The high degree of independence from serum growth factor requirements appears to be a major in vitro characteristic of PLC/AN/2 cells, making them a suitable model system for the more precise definition of the human hepatocellular carcinoma phenotype, including mechanisms of growth control.\r"

This study examined 239 autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients and 189 unaffected family members to define the factors that influence the presence and severity of hepatic cysts. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients with hepatic cysts were older than autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients without such cysts (44.6 +/- 1.1 yr vs. 32.9 +/- 1.1 yr; p less than 0.0001). The number of hepatic cysts increased with age (r = 0.43; p less than 0.0001). Women were more likely to have massive hepatic cystic disease (greater than 15 cysts) than men (p less than 0.04). Women also had larger maximal cyst size (4.2 +/- 0.4 cm vs. 2.7 +/- 0.3 cm; p less than 0.004). Women with hepatic cysts were more likely to have been pregnant (p less than 0.001) and to have had more pregnancies (2.9 +/- 0.3 pregnancies vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 pregnancies; p less than 0.0009). Kidney volume (p less than 0.0001), number of cysts (p less than 0.004), percentage of cystic parenchyma (p less than 0.001) and predominant cyst size (p less than 0.001) were greater and creatinine clearance was lower (64.5 +/- 3.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 94.5 +/- 3.4 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.001) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients with hepatic cysts. By logistic regression, the frequency of hepatic cysts was related to increased age, increased severity of renal cystic disease and decreased creatinine clearance. Number and size of hepatic cysts correlated with the occurrence of pregnancy, female gender, increased age and severity of the renal lesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the iron-loaded liver there may be an increase in the putative intracellular transit pool of iron, components of which could be catalytically active in stimulating lipid peroxidation. To study the levels of low-molecular-weight, catalytically active iron in the liver, cytosolic ultrafiltrates were tested in an assay containing rat liver microsomes and NADPH. Malondialdehyde production was used as an index of lipid peroxidation. This assay system was sensitive enough to detect 0.25 mumol/L ferrous iron; progressive but non-linear increases in malondialdehyde were produced as the iron concentration was increased to 5 mumol/L. Ultrafiltrates from hepatic cytosol of iron-loaded rats had greater prooxidant action than did those from controls. When added to the assay, deferoxamine, an iron chelator, completely suppressed the prooxidant action of hepatic ultrafiltrates, showing that this activity is iron-dependent. Deferoxamine administered intraperitoneally to control animals at a dose of 1 gm/kg completely inhibited the prooxidant effect of hepatic ultrafiltrates prepared from rats killed after 1, 2 and 3 hr. Partial inhibition was observed at 4 hr; by 6 hr the inhibitory effect of deferoxamine was completely lost. Administration of deferoxamine (1 gm/kg intraperitoneally, 1 hr before killing) completely inhibited the prooxidant action of hepatic ultrafiltrates in moderately iron-loaded rats and controls but had no protective effect in heavily iron-loaded rats. These results support the concept that iron overload results in an increase in a hepatic cytosolic pool of low-molecular-weight iron that is catalytically active in stimulating lipid peroxidation. This pool can be chelated transiently in vivo by deferoxamine in moderate, but not heavy, iron overload.\r"

Results were compared with those in 31 patients who had received conventional retreatments after 3.4 +/- 0.3 relapses (range = two to eight relapses). During 44 +/- 7 mo of low-dose therapy (range = 9 to 149 mo), one patient (5%) entered sustained remission, 16 patients (72%) continued treatment, two patients (9%) received liver transplantations, two patients (9%) died of liver-related complications and one patient (5%) died of a nonliver-related cause. Drug-related side effects improved in 11 of 13 patients who had acquired them during conventional therapy (85%). The median dose of prednisone was 7.5 mg daily (range = 1 to 17.5 mg) with and without azathioprine. Thirteen patients received long-term treatment consisting of 10 mg or less of prednisone only. Patients receiving conventional treatment entered remission more frequently than those on low-dose therapy (97% vs. 36%, p less than 0.001) but they relapsed after drug withdrawal (53% vs. 87%, p greater than 0.01), required continuous therapy (55% vs. 72%, p greater than 0.1) and died of liver-related complications (10% vs. 9%) as commonly as those receiving low-dose therapy. We conclude that low-dose corticosteroid therapy in patients who have experienced multiple relapses has similar efficacy and less morbidity than conventional retreatments.\r"

The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis D virus antigen among hepatitis B virus carriers with histories of sexual exposure to prostitutes was 10.3% (14 of 136) and the prevalence of hepatitis D virus antigen among the female prostitutes who were hepatitis B virus carriers was 59% (24 of 51). Among those who admitted to sexual contact with prostitutes, testing for hepatitis D virus antigen revealed positive correlations with the frequency of such sexual contacts and with the frequency of history of venereal diseases. Among the female prostitutes, the prevalence of hepatitis D virus antigen had a positive correlation with the frequency of sexual contact and a negative correlation with age. Analysis of serum hepatitis D virus RNA among those with hepatitis D virus antigen revealed that 4 of the 9 with sexual exposure to prostitutes and 3 of the 24 prostitutes were positive. From these findings, we conclude that these two groups are not only at high risk for hepatitis D virus infection but also form a reservoir of this virus.\r"

Nineteen patients had evidence of hepatitis D virus infection, as assessed by the presence in serum of delta antigen, anti-delta antibodies, or both. Hepatitis B virus DNA was found in only two patients: one was a chronic HBsAg carrier with hepatitis D virus superinfection and the other had fulminant hepatitis caused by hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection. Hepatitis D virus RNA was detected in three patients: two with hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection and also in the HBsAg carrier with positive hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis D virus superinfection. None of 10 patients with hepatitis B virus infection alone had detectable viral nucleic acids in serum. Overall, viral nucleic acids were detected in the sera of 4 of the 29 patients (14%). Hepatitis D virus antigenemia did not indicate hepatitis D virus replication because hepatitis D virus RNA was not detected in 9 of 12 patients with hepatitis D virus antigen in their sera. The low frequency of viral replication found in fulminant hepatitis B or D may explain the low recurrence rate of viral hepatitis in patients with fulminant hepatitis who have received liver transplantations.\r"

Most biopsy specimens were essentially normal by light microscopy before transplantation, and no particular feature could be relied on to predict function after transplantation. Ultrastructural examination of biopsy specimens before transplantation demonstrated preferential degeneration of sinusoidal lining cells, but no strict correlation was seen between ultrastructural sinusoidal integrity before transplantation and function after transplantation. The presence of zonal or severe focal necrosis and a severe neutrophilic exudate in biopsy specimens after reperfusion presaged a poor early postoperative course in most, but not all, patients. The presence of preformed lymphocytotoxic antibodies had no effect on the early clinical course, but was associated with Kupffer cell hypertrophy in needle biopsy specimens taken after transplantation. No definite evidence was seen of hyperacute rejection as a result of preformed lymphocytotoxic antibodies as detected in conventional assays. These findings suggest that preservation injury accounts for only a subset of grafts that fail to function after transplantation. Other perioperative or \"recipient\" factors may be of equal or greater importance in early graft dysfunction or failure.\r"

The patients showed a severe reduction in the quantitative liver function as assessed by estimation of the clearance of antipyrine; the median value was 9 ml.min-1 and the range was 6 to 12 ml.min-1. Apparent clearance of oxazepam in cirrhotic patients was 0.55 ml.min-1.kg-1, with a range of 0.46 to 1.24 ml.min-1.kg-1, compared with 1.19 ml.min-1.kg-1 and a range of 0.80 to 1.66 ml.min-1.kg-1 in the controls (p less than 0.05). The unbound clearance of oxazepam in patients was 4.1 ml.min-1.kg-1, with a range of 3.4 to 5.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, compared with 25.4 ml.min-1.kg-1, and a range of 16.7 to 43.7 ml.min-1.kg-1, p less than 0.001, in the controls. In patients with liver disease, the unbound clearance of oxazepam correlated significantly with antipyrine clearance (r = 0.88; p less than 0.05). The results suggest a reduced capacity for glucuronidation in patients with decompensated liver disease and severe hepatic failure that corresponds to the general reduction in the quantitative liver function.\r"

Type III procollagen peptide in serum was measured in two assays: the Type III Procollagen Peptide Radioimmunoassay Kit, a new assay that selectively determines the intact propeptide (and larger type III propeptide-holding antigens) and the Type III procollagen Fab assay that measures both the intact propeptide and the smaller fragments that quantitatively dominate in serum. A significant decrease in the concentration of the intact propeptide between the artery and the hepatic vein was found in the group with normal liver function (p less than 0.01) and in patients with cirrhosis (p less than 0.01). In patients with cirrhosis, however, the splanchnic extraction ratio of the intact propeptide (median = 0.04, range = -0.03 to 0.16) was significantly lower than in patients with normal liver function (median = 0.17, range = 0.05 to 0.36, p less than 0.01).

No splanchnic extraction could be demonstrated in the Type III propeptide Fab assay. A significant renal extraction was found in the Fab assay, but not in Type III Procollagen Peptide Radioimmunoassay Kit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Five of the target autoantigens have now been identified as enzymes of three related multienzyme complexes: the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Each complex consists of component enzymes designated E1, E2 and E3. In this report, we confirm that primary biliary cirrhosis sera react with dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase, the E2 component of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Seventy-three of 188 (39%) primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted with alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-E2 when immunoblotted against purified alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; one of these sera also reacted with the E1 component. In addition, primary biliary cirrhosis sera possessing alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-E2 reactivity specifically inhibited enzyme function of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Enzyme activity was not affected by primary biliary cirrhosis sera that contained autoantibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 and/or branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex-E2, which lacked alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-E2 reactivity. Furthermore, affinity-purified primary biliary cirrhosis sera against alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-E2 inhibited only alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activity but did not alter enzyme activity of either pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Finally, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex-E2 specific affinity-purified antisera did not react on immunoblot with any component enzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of hepatocytes in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism has been extensively studied. By contrast, nothing is known about the role of bile ductular epithelial cells in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. The purpose of the current studies was to establish whether bile ductular epithelial cells synthesize cholesterol, bile acids or both and to determine whether these cells are capable of metabolizing (hydroxylating, conjugating) bile acids. Bile ductular epithelial cells were isolated from rat liver after ligation of the common bile duct for 6 to 8 wk. Bile ductular epithelial cells were essentially free (greater than 99%) of hepatocytes and were histochemically positive (greater than 80%) for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. Cholestatic hepatocytes were simultaneously isolated and characterized with regard to their ability to synthesize and metabolize bile acids. Incubation of bile ductular epithelial cells with [14C]-acetate resulted in rapid labeling of cellular cholesterol, suggesting that these cells have a complete cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The addition of [4-14C]-cholesterol to bile ductular epithelial cells did not lead to detectable synthesis of [14C]-bile acids. [24-14C]-Cholic acid, [24-14C]-deoxycholic acid, [24-14C]-lithocholic acid and [3H]-ursodeoxycholic acid were individually added to bile ductular epithelial cells and incubated for 24 or 48 hr. Bile acid metabolites were extracted and separated by C-18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography or thin-layer chromatography. Bile ductular epithelial cells conjugated deoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid to glycine and taurine. Surprisingly, no conjugation of cholic acid was detected. Conjugated lithocholic acid was further metabolized to highly polar metabolite(s), possibly beta-muricholic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each group of four to five rabbits received a chow diet supplemented with a single conjugate of ursodeoxycholic acid ursodeoxycholyl-glycine, ursodeoxycholyl-sarcosine, ursodeoxycholyl-taurine or ursodeoxycholyl-N-methyltaurine for 3 wks at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day; a control group received chow alone. After 3 wks of feeding, animals receiving ursodeoxycholyl-glycine or ursodeoxycholyl-taurine had hepatotoxicity associated with abnormal liver tests. Lithocholic acid made up 11% +/- 2.7% of biliary bile acids in the ursodeoxycholyl-glycine and 10% +/- 2.2% in the ursodeoxycholyl-taurine group. In contrast, animals receiving ursodeoxycholyl-sarcosine or ursodeoxycholyl-N-methyltaurine had neither hepatotoxicity nor abnormal liver tests and the proportion of lithocholic acid in biliary bile acids increased much less. Complementary studies showed that ursodeoxycholyl-sarcosine and ursodeoxycholyl-N-methyltaurine were not biotransformed during hepatic transport and were resistant to deconjugation and dehydroxylation in the rabbit. These experiments indicate that the N-methyl amino acid conjugates of ursodeoxycholic acid are nontoxic in the rabbit and resist deconjugation and dehydroxylation. Such resistance decreases formation of lithocholic acid in the colon, thus reducing its accumulation and consequent induction of hepatotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Samples of gallbladder bile obtained from 25 controls and 34 patients with pigment (28 cases) or cholesterol (6 cases) gallstones were studied to establish whether disturbances in regulation of the biliary pH are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of gallstones. Samples were assayed for pH, PCO2 and concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate and calcium (total and ionized). Saturation of bile in calcium carbonate was calculated. The main results of the study were as follows: (a) mean (+/- S.D.) PCO2 was significantly higher in gallbladder bile (6.72 +/- 0.36 kPa (in controls) and 7.63 +/- 0.29 kPa in patients) than in blood. This is consonant with previous results in animal species; it suggests that also in man a mucosal Na+ H+ antiport acidifies the gallbladder bile generating CO2 from biliary bicarbonate. (b) Biliary pH decreased when sodium concentration increased over a range of 140 to 280 mM. The pH decreased slightly when sodium increased from 140 to 200 mM and rapidly beyond this value; the rapid pH decrease in concentrated bile was associated with bicarbonate concentrations lower than 1 to 2 mM. The results showed that bicarbonate is the main buffer of gallbladder bile. (c) The pH decrease during bile concentration was similar in patients and controls. In both groups, fully concentrated bile was unsaturated in calcium carbonate. The results suggest that gallstone formation is not due to disturbances of biliary pH regulation. However, the normal concentration process that increases Ca++ concentration up to 4 mM and lowers pH values is likely to favor, in fully concentrated biles, the precipitation of calcium salts such as calcium bilirubinate.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess whether dipyridamole infusion might induce ischemic-like electrocardiographic changes in asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients and to describe the clinical and echocardiographic correlates possibly associated with this response. We therefore studied a control group of 20 normotensive individuals and a group of 28 asymptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. All underwent dipyridamole-echocardiography testing (12-lead electrocardiogram and two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring with dipyridamole infusion, 0.84 mg/kg over 10'). No patient showed transient regional dyssynergy during dipyridamole infusion. None of the normotensive and 10 of 28 of the hypertensive participants had horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression more than 0.1 mV during dipyridamole (0% versus 36%, p less than 0.01). Hypertensive patients with (\"responders\") (n = 10) and without (\"nonresponders\") (n = 18) ST segment depression showed similar values of percent fractional shortening in baseline conditions (32 +/- 5 versus 33 +/- 6, p = NS) and at peak dipyridamole infusion (45 +/- 8 versus 43 +/- 5, p = NS). The peak early to peak late velocity ratio values (evaluated from transmitral flow tracings by Doppler technique) were also similar in baseline conditions (0.86 +/- 0.14 versus 0.94 +/- 0.30, p = NS) and at peak dipyridamole (0.72 +/- 0.15 versus 0.78 +/- 0.32, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 4-week ascending aortic banded rats, in vivo peak systolic left ventricular pressure increased to 178 +/- 8 mm Hg (103 +/- 6 mm Hg in sham-operated control group). This increased pressure produced myocardial hypertrophy, and the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was 46% above that of the control group. After the rats were killed, the coronary perfusion pressure-flow relations were obtained during resting conditions and maximal vasodilation after a 40-second period of ischemia in beating but nonworking isolated hearts perfused with Tyrode's solution with bovine red blood cells and albumin. In hearts from control rats, coronary autoregulation (i.e., a slight decrease in flow with reduction of pressure) was observed in the range of 50-100 mm Hg of perfusion pressure. A pronounced reactive hyperemic response was observed: a peak flow/resting flow ratio of 2.9 +/- 0.1 and a repayment ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.2 at 100 mm Hg of perfusion pressure. In hearts of banded rats the resting pressure-flow relation was rectilinear in the range of 25-175 mm Hg of perfusion pressure. Flow reserve and the time of reactive hyperemia to one half peak flow decreased at 50, 100, and 150 mm Hg of perfusion pressure compared with values in control rat hearts. Four weeks after debanding, peak systolic left ventricular pressure and cardiac hypertrophy had normalized. The impaired autoregulation, decreased flow reserve, and diminished reactive hyperemic response had completely reversed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Myocardial oxygen supply and oxygen consumption were determined during baseline and atrial pacing conditions 30 days after New Zealand White rabbits were prepared as one-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive or uninephrectomized sham control rabbits. Coronary blood flow and cardiac output, using radioactive microspheres, and small vessel oxygen saturations, using microspectrophotometry, were measured in hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied hearts. After 30 days, baseline blood pressure was significantly higher in the Goldblatt rabbits compared with sham controls, and hypertension was maintained during pacing. The myocardium was hypertrophied in the Goldblatt hypertensive rabbits compared with sham controls. Baseline heart rates were not different between animal groups (242 +/- 32 and 244 +/- 24 beats/min, respectively). Both groups were paced 35% above baseline heart rates; during pacing, cardiac output was similar to baseline values in the sham controls (304 +/- 99 versus 321 +/- 116 ml/min, respectively) but reduced in the hypertensive rabbits (248 +/- 43 versus 325 +/- 62 ml/min). Myocardial oxygen consumption increased twofold in both nonhypertrophied and hypertrophied ventricles during tachycardia. Oxygen extraction was significantly elevated, but coronary blood flow was not altered during pacing in either animal group. Therefore, at the pacing level chosen the diminished function in cardiac hypertrophy was not associated with reduced oxygen consumption. Conversely, reduced efficiency during pacing in the hypertrophied myocardium was suggested.\r"

Because a notable neutral lipid (1,2-diacylglycerol) is generated from phosphoinositide hydrolysis and is assumed to be a secondary messenger, we determined 1,2-diacylglycerol content and its fatty acid profiles in the thoracic aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared it with those of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. After the aorta was exposed to 10(-5) M norepinephrine as a stimulant, 1,2-diacylglycerol content in SHR was significantly higher by 33% than in WKY rats at 4 weeks of age, whereas there was no difference in 1,2-diacylglycerol content between the two strains at 20 weeks of age. Before norepinephrine stimulation, there was no significant difference in 1,2-diacylglycerol level between the two strains at 4 weeks of age. Analysis on a gas chromatograph showed that 1,2-diacylglycerol was composed of similar molecular species of fatty acids in aortas obtained from SHR and WKY rats. On the other hand, the cholesterol content of aortas was higher in SHR than in WKY rats at 20 weeks of age, whereas the difference at 4 weeks was not significant. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triglyceride showed no significant difference between the two strains. It is concluded that norepinephrine-induced 1,2-diacylglycerol production increases in the thoracic aorta of SHR before the development of hypertension.\r"

Salt-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-R), which do not increase their blood pressure in response to high salt intake, and salt-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S), which do exhibit significant elevations in blood pressure on high salt diets (3.15% NaCl), were used. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]rauwolscine were performed on 6- and 11-week-old SHR-S and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats to determine the effects of age, strain, and salt intake on alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number and affinity. One week of high salt intake significantly increased blood pressure 22% in 6-week-old SHR-S and increased the blood pressure of 11-week-old SHR-S 12% without altering WKY rat controls. This treatment did not significantly increase renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in either SHR-S or WKY rats. SHR-S had significantly higher numbers of renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptors than WKY rats on the high salt diets. One week of high (3.15%) or low (0.05%) salt intake did not significantly alter renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number in 11-week-old SHR-S or WKY rats; however, blood pressure was significantly elevated in the SHR-S (175.0 +/- 3.5 versus 196.0 +/- 3.0 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These findings suggest that reduced noradrenergic input to sympathoinhibitory neurons in anterior hypothalamus contributes to NaCl-sensitive hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The current study tested the hypothesis that dietary NaCl supplementation depresses endogenous norepinephrine stores and turnover in anterior hypothalamus of two other NaCl-sensitive models of hypertension, the Dahl salt-sensitive rat and the deoxycorticosterone acetate/NaCl hypertensive rat, thus increasing blood pressure by reducing noradrenergic input to the anterior hypothalamus. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high (8%) NaCl diet, and deoxycorticosterone acetate/NaCl rats rats drank 1% NaCl solution ad libitum for 2 or 4 weeks. Age-matched Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a basal 1% NaCl diet and uninephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats drinking tap water were controls. Regional brain catecholamines were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Norepinephrine turnover in hypothalamus (anterior, posterior, and ventral regions) and brain stem (pons and medulla) was assessed using the dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitor 1-cyclohexyl-2-mercapto-imidazole. High NaCl treatment caused significant elevations in blood pressure in Dahl salt-sensitive and deoxycorticosterone acetate/NaCl rats, but endogenous norepinephrine levels and turnover rates were not significantly different in anterior hypothalamus or any other brain region studied between the NaCl-supplemented and control groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The numbers of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cells and total ganglionic cell numbers were both greater in ganglia of young normotensive than in those of hypertensive rats. Between 10 and 60 weeks of age, peptide immunoreactivity and total cell numbers both fell in normotensive rat ganglia but remained constant in ganglia from hypertensive rats. Densitometric analysis showed that the concentrations of neuropeptide Y were similar in neurons of age-matched individuals of both strains, but during aging there was a substantial decline in neuronal peptide content that was similar in both strains and that was not accompanied by any decline in neuronal immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase. Our results suggest that there is a developmental abnormality of neuropeptide Y in sympathetic neurons of this strain of genetically hypertensive rat and that, furthermore, the aging process is accompanied by a selective loss of neuronal neuropeptide Y that is independent of blood pressure status.\r"

  ".W": "The history of research on the \"structural factor\" in primary hypertension is briefly reviewed, and the gradual realization of its important influence on the hemodynamics of hypertension is outlined, as seen from a \"personal angle.\" Experiences from previous studies of normal vascular function in animals were decisive for our first hemodynamic demonstration concerning the \"structural upward resetting\" of the systemic resistance vessels in human primary hypertension. Subsequent quantitative studies in rats with primary and secondary hypertension complemented these studies, confirming that the critical structural changes are a rapid increase in precapillary resistance at full dilatation associated with an increase in wall/lumen ratio due mainly to media hypertrophy and occurring in both primary and renal hypertension. Analyses were also performed concerning cardiac, barostat, and venous structural resettings, which are briefly mentioned. In our first studies of human primary hypertension, we suggested that the structural factor might itself be genetically reinforced, and increasing evidence in favor of this view is now accumulating. It is further discussed how antihypertensive therapy should be directed primarily against the structural upward resetting, as dependent on the local pressure and \"trophic\" influences, and some of our results in rat models are outlined. Finally, as the structural factor at the systemic resistance level also invites positive feedback interactions with functional \"pressor\" influences, it is, in a way, more difficult to explain why 85-90% of people remain normotensive than how hypertension gradually develops in 10-15% of people. This points to some powerful and durable negative feedbacks, which are still poorly understood, because most so far known barostats are readily reset upward in hypertension. It is here that the Muirhead renomedullary depressor system, and perhaps also the unmyelinated baroreceptor-volume receptor afferents, may be of particular importance.\r"

Postoperative care was identical in both groups. Both catheter groups were comparable with regards to age, sex, obesity and prior abdominal surgery. Catheter removal due to drainage failure was significantly greater with the column disc than the Tenckhoff catheters (22% vs 5%, p = 0.04). In addition, 39% of column disc catheters compared to 11% Tenckhoff catheters were removed as a result of therapy resistant peritonitis (p = 0.011). Furthermore, there was a greater incidence of peritonitis with the column disc than with the Tenckhoff catheters at the end of the first year (71% vs 42%, p less than 0.01). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to other complications, such as pericatheter leak, catheter infections, catheter cuff-extrusion or hernia. Our experience indicates that the column disc catheter is associated with higher complication rates and does not offer any advantage over the Tenckhoff catheter.\r"

These consist of a woven Dacron vessel graft to which a short silastic segment is vulcanized. In 36 calves surviving total artificial heart replacement between one and seven months (average 85 days) the morphological alterations due to interfacial reactions were studied: thrombus formation and neointimal fibrous hyperplasia at the anastomoses. In 15 calves (41.7%) thrombus growth within the outflow tract led to anastomotic stenosis: pulmonary artery 14 (93.3%), aorta-anastomosis 1 (2.8%), both vessels 1 (2.8%), in combination with pannus growth in atrial location 13 (86.7%). In 73.3% the pannus consisted of infected organized thrombus imitating the course of septic vegetative endocarditis. Two calves were reoperated in order to remove the vegetative thrombi, one successfully. In five animals pulmonary stenosis was the main cause of death. The presence and location of excessive tissue growth and thrombus formation within the outflow tract are also inherent to the fluid mechanical design of the valve. Neointimal fibrous hyperplasia at the anastomoses of the grafts seems to be a reparative process started up by platelet-induced subendothelial cell proliferation in response to intimal injuries.\r"

A differential stimulation of the osmoreceptors, baroceptors, renin-angiotensin and the sympathetico-adrenal systems in these patients, resulted in the variations in the pattern of hormone release. Patients with MVD showed a greater stimulation of osmoreceptors, baroceptors and release of Arginine vasopressin (AVP). Renin-angiotensin system was more easily triggered in patients with AVD or CAD; and sympathetico-adrenal system in patients with CAD. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was better preserved in patients with CAD (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001) than in the patients with MVD (r = 0.38, p less than 0.02). Plasma renin release showed a significant correlation with noradrenaline release in the patients with MVD (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01); but this relationship was lost in the patients with the CAD, due to an excessive noradrenaline release. Pulsatile bypass reduced but did not abolish this response. Under unfavourable conditions, the stress response may persist in the early post-operative period.\r"

In the present study, the above data are incorporated into a mathematical correlation, which serves as a basic model for the estimation of blood damage. This mathematical model was applied to in vitro investigations of 25 different aortic valve prostheses. The results were compared to clinical findings. In most cases agreement was good, indicating that this model may be directly applied to the clinical situation. This new method facilitates the estimation of clinically expected blood damage from in vitro measurements. It may be useful for the development and evaluation of new valve prostheses. By comparative evaluation of different valve types it also provides additional information to help the implanting surgeon select the optimum valve for his patient.\r"

The study was designed to quantify and correlate changes in these properties in orthotopic, stably fixed, weight-bearing grafts and to provide a baseline for additional studies of allografts. The grafts were eight centimeters long and internally fixed. The mechanical properties of the grafts were studied by torsional testing. Metabolic turnover of the grafts was evaluated by preoperative labeling of the dogs with 3H-tetracycline for resorption of bone mineral and with 3H-proline for turnover of collagen. Cortical bone area and porosity were measured. Postoperative formation of bone was evaluated by sequential labeling with fluorochrome. The vascularized grafts resembled the fibulae that had had a sham operation and those that had not had an operation with regard to the total number of osteons and the remodeling process, as measured both morphometrically and metabolically. The vascularized grafts were stronger and stiffer than the non-vascularized grafts and were not different from the bones that had had a sham operation. In contrast, the non-vascularized grafts were smaller, weaker, less stiff, and more porotic, had fewer osteons, and demonstrated increased turnover and resorption compared with the vascularized grafts, the bones that had had a sham operation, and the bones that had not been operated on.\r"

In eight patients, a transverse fibrous band prevented the patella from seating well in the sulcus of the femoral component. In four patients, the fibrous band extended from the superolateral border of the patella to the infrapatellar fat pad, tethering the patella laterally. In one patient, the fibrous band extended from the distal pole of the patella to the intracondylar notch, tethering the patella inferiorly.

The knee scores improved from an average of 51 points before operation to an average of 87 points post-operatively. Seven knees had a score of 85 points or more and were considered to have an excellent clinical result. Two knees had a good result, with scores of 77 and 72 points. One knee had another revision because of painful non-union of a medial structural graft, and the result in that knee was considered a failure. The average range of motion improved from 84 degrees to 105 degrees. There were no deep infections, and no graft showed evidence of fracture or collapse. Radiographs demonstrated complete incorporation of the graft in eleven of the twelve knees at an average of twenty-three months after operation. Single-photon-emission computed-tomography scans showed uniform activity in the area of the graft in four of the five knees that were studied.\r"

To determine the incidence, risk factors, appropriate management, and results of treatment of this complication, the records of the Orthopaedic Oncology Unit of the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. Forty-three patients were identified in whom a tumor had been treated with an allograft that had subsequently fractured. The over-all incidence of fracture was almost 16 per cent. When the several risk factors (age and sex of the patient, stage and site of the lesion, and so on) for the forty-three patients who had a fracture were compared with those for the rest of the series, the only correlation was the incidence of non-union at the site of the host-donor junction, which was significantly higher in the patients who had a fracture. The mean time to fracture was 28.6 months after the operation. Three types of fractures occurred: Type I (two patients), rapid dissolution of the graft; Type II (twenty-two patients), fracture of the shaft, which was observed more frequently in male patients and which occurred a mean of 27.6 months after the operation; and Type III (nineteen patients), fragmentation of the joint, which usually occurred later (a mean of 31.6 months postoperatively) and was found more frequently in female patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90307753\r", 
  ".W": "A new approach was developed for the treatment of planovalgus feet in children who have spastic cerebral palsy and are less than six years old. The procedure consists of subtalar stabilization (arthroereisis) with a Vitallium staple, and it corrects alignment, restores balance, and allows continued function. It is safe, technically simple, and efficient. Between 1980 and 1988, forty-eight arthroereises were done. The results of thirty-one procedures in twenty patients who were two to ten years and ten months old at the time of the operation were followed for an average of 4.1 years (range, two to seven years). Approximately 85 per cent of the results were excellent or good. Only one foot needed a revision; this was due to migration of the staple. At the most recent follow-up, the talocalcaneal angle had not changed in about 50 per cent of the feet. In another seven, the change ranged from 5 to 10 degrees. All of these patients had a satisfactory result. In all but three feet, the goal of maintaining the stability of the talocalcaneal joint without orthotics or osseous fusion was achieved. Originally, the procedure was done only in patients who were less than six years old, but, because of its success, the indications were extended to children of any age who had severely involved and neurologically compromised feet. Satisfactory results were obtained in the older children as well.\r"

A classification of the fractures was devised on the basis of fracture patterns involving the posterior facet joint of the calcaneus. In Type I, the fracture fragments were small or not displaced; in Type II, they were displaced; and in Type III, they were comminuted. There were thirteen Type-I, ten Type-II, and seven Type-III fractures, all of which were treated with a variety of closed methods. The length of follow-up ranged from eighteen to fifty-two months (mean, thirty-six months). The results were graded by a predetermined point system that included the evaluation of motion of the subtalar joint. Of the thirteen Type-I fractures, eight had an excellent result; four, a good result; and one, a fair result. Of the ten Type-II fractures, two had a good result; four, a fair result; and four, a poor result. All of the seven Type-III fractures had a poor result. On the basis of our study of the fracture patterns as seen on the computerized tomography scans, we believe that it is possible to predict which fractures will do well with closed treatment and which will not. Type-I fractures did well with closed treatment. Type-II fractures can be treated closed but with a lower success rate than Type-I fractures. All of the Type-III fractures had a poor result after closed treatment.\r"

Bone was the second most common site of involvement (seventeen patients); in approximately one-half of these patients, the osseous site did not cause symptoms. Metaphyses of long bones and small bones were involved the most; the metaphyseal lesions tended to be eccentric, well circumscribed, and lytic. There were two deaths--the most recent, more than twenty years ago--of patients who had involvement of bones and joints; these patients, by modern standards, had had inadequate treatment. Treatment with amphotericin B and, more recently, with ketoconazole, in conjunction with operative treatment, was very effective.\r"

A laminectomy was performed on the lumbar spine of adult male New Zealand White rabbits. Receptive fields of mechanosensitive afferent units were investigated in the lumbar facet joint and adjacent surrounding tissues, and electrophysiological recordings were obtained from filaments of the dorsal root. Twenty-four units were identified in the region of the facet joint: ten, in the capsule of the joint; twelve, in the border regions between capsule and muscle or tendon; and two, in the ligamentum flavum. Of these units, two had a conduction velocity that was slower than 2.5 meters per second (group IV), fifteen had a velocity ranging from 2.5 to twenty meters per second (group III), and seven had a velocity faster than twenty meters per second. Seven units had a von Frey threshold of more than 6.0 grams, thirteen had a threshold of less than 6.0 grams, and four were not examined. Seven units in the facet joint responded to movement of the joint. Fourteen other mechanosensitive units were found in the muscle, tendon, and interspinous ligament; seven had a conduction velocity of 2.5 to twenty meters per second, and seven had a velocity that was faster than twenty meters per second.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients who had unilateral deficiency of the anterior cruciate ligament and ten healthy control subjects were analyzed during level walking, jogging, and ascending and descending stairs. Kinematic and kinetic findings for the right and left hips, knees, and ankles of all of the patients and control subjects were recorded during each activity. Substantial differences from normal function were observed for both limbs of the patients during level walking and during jogging. The magnitude of the maximum moment that tended to flex the knee was reduced the most (140 per cent) during level walking. It was reduced less (30 per cent) during jogging, it was not changed while the patient descended stairs, and it was slightly increased while he or she ascended stairs. The reduction in the magnitude of the flexion moment about the knee was interpreted as the patient's effort to reduce or avoid contraction of the quadriceps. Reduction of the flexion moment reduces any contraction of the quadriceps because there must be a mechanical balance between the external moment (due to body weight and the weight and inertia of the segment of the limb) that tends to flex the knee and an internal moment (generated by contraction of the quadriceps) that tends to extend the knee. This so-called quadriceps-avoidance gait was related to the angle of flexion of the knee when the maximum flexion moment occurred during each activity. This angle of flexion was 20 degrees during walking, 40 degrees during jogging, and approximately 60 degrees during stair-climbing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms used by some patients to reduce loading at the knee (adduction moment) also were analyzed. We evaluated the gait of twenty-seven patients (thirty-two knees) who had had a proximal tibial osteotomy for a varus gonarthrosis. Twenty-four patients (twenty-eight knees) returned for follow-up at three to 8.9 years after the osteotomy. This is a follow-up to our original study (Prodromos et al.), which described a relationship between the magnitude of the adduction moment at the knee during walking and the outcome of proximal tibial osteotomy. The patients were divided into low and high adduction-moment groups on the basis of the magnitude of the adduction moment at the knee as measured preoperatively during walking. All fourteen patients in the low adduction-moment group and nine of the fourteen patients in the high adduction-moment group had a good or excellent result. The varus deformity recurred in ten patients in the high adduction-moment group and in three patients in the low adduction-moment group. All of the results degenerated over time. The adaptive mechanism that was used to lower the adduction moment during gait included shortening the stride and toeing-out. The significant correlation between the magnitudes of the inversion moment at the ankle and the adduction moment at the knee suggested that the toe-out gait reduced the adduction moment at the knee.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At that time, we analyzed the degree of curvature to determine if it was related to parental age at the time of the patient's birth. Patients who were born to mothers who were twenty-seven years old or more had a mean curve of 35.2 degrees, which was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than that of patients whose mothers were younger than twenty-seven years, who had a mean curve of 30.4 degrees. More patients whose mothers were twenty-seven years old or older ultimately needed arthrodesis than did those whose mothers were younger than twenty-seven years (26 compared with 12 per cent). Therefore, a maternal age of twenty-seven years old or more is a risk factor for greater progression of the curve and indicates a potential need for arthrodesis. No difference in the degree of curvature was seen when the patients were grouped according to paternal age.\r"

Conservative treatment with rest, walking aids, and, for some patients, splinting of the extremity resulted in relief of pain and healing of the fracture. A careful clinical assessment that includes new radiographs and, if necessary, bone scans is essential for early diagnosis in patients who have acute, incapacitating pain in the knee.\r"

Amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequence analysis data indicate that the plasminogens of neonates and adults have the same amino acid sequence. Like the adult, the neonate has two glycoforms, but both have significantly more mannose and sialic acid than the adult forms. The difference in the neonatal glycosylation is probably responsible for the altered migration observed by isoelectric focusing. Moreover, the difference in carbohydrate composition appears to be the basis of the decreased functional activity of the neonatal plasminogen. The kcat/Km ratios indicate that the overall activation rates of the two neonatal plasminogen glycoforms are lower compared with the adult glycoforms. In addition, neonatal plasminogen does not bind as well to cellular receptors compared with adult plasminogen. These studies suggest a basis for the decreased fibrinolytic activity observed in neonates.\r"

Airway epithelial cells may be infected with RSV, but it is unknown whether other cells within the lung permit viral replication. We studied whether human alveolar macrophages supported RSV replication in vitro. Alveolar macrophages exposed to RSV demonstrated expression of RSV fusion gene, which increased in a time-dependent manner and correlated with RSV protein expression. RSV-exposed alveolar macrophages produced and released infectious virus into supernatants for at least 25 d after infection. Viral production per alveolar macrophage declined from 0.053 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell at 24 h after infection to 0.003 pfu/cell by 10 d after infection and then gradually increased. The capability of alveolar macrophages to support prolonged RSV replication may have a role in the pulmonary response to RSV infection.\r"

We screened normal thyroid tissue from 59 female patients; of the informative cases 14 were heterozygous for a Bgl I site on PGK and 4 were heterozygous for a Bam HI site on HPRT. In monoclonal tumors, one of the polymorphic alleles was selectively digested after additional digestion with Hpa II, a methylation sensitive enzyme, whereas in polyclonal tissue both were decreased to a similar extent. Normal thyroid tissue from all patients showed a polyclonal pattern. Of the 18 tumors studied, 12 were solitary thyroid nodules, and 6 were obtained from multinodular goiters (MNG). The following were monoclonal: 6/6 follicular adenomas, 2/2 follicular carcinomas, and 1/1 anaplastic carcinoma. Two of the three papillary carcinomas showed intermediate patterns, possibly due to contaminating effects of stromal tissue present in most of these neoplasms. Of the six nodules from MNG, four were polyclonal. The two largest gave a distinct monoclonal pattern. Most solitary thyroid tumors are monoclonal, supporting a somatic cell mutation model of thyroid neoplasm formation. Nodules from MNG are largely hyperplastic, although monoclonal neoplasms do occasionally arise within these glands. The specific somatic mutations leading to clonal expansion and determination of tumor phenotype are presently unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The rhizomelic form of chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a peroxisomal disorder characterized biochemically by an impairment of plasmalogen biosynthesis and phytanate catabolism. We have now found that the maturation of peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase is impaired in fibroblasts from RCDP patients. To establish the subcellular localization of the 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase precursor protein, cultured skin fibroblasts were fractionated on a continuous Nycodenz gradient. Only a small amount of 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase activity was present in the catalase-containing (peroxisomal) fractions of RCDP fibroblasts in comparison with control fibroblasts. Moreover, the amount of thiolase protein in immunoblots of the catalase-containing fractions was below the limit of detection. Finally, the beta-oxidation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA was found to be reduced in these fractions. We conclude that the mutation in RCDP leads to a partial deficiency of 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase activity in the peroxisomes and, concomitantly, an impairment in the ability to convert the precursor of this protein to the mature form. The reduction of 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase activity results in a decrease in the rate of peroxisomal beta-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA. However, the capacity of the peroxisomes to oxidize very-long-chain fatty acids must be sufficient to prevent excessive accumulation of these compounds in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90307953\r", 
  ".W": "The Brattleboro rat, which has an autosomally recessive form of diabetes insipidus, has been reported to have a marked defect in the regulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene expression. However, it is not known whether this is a primary genetic defect or occurs secondary to the urinary water losses which occur in the absence of circulating AVP in the Brattleboro rat. This present study was therefore undertaken to study AVP gene regulation in the Brattleboro rat after chronic AVP treatment by osmotic minipump for 2 wk. In Brattleboro rats without AVP treatment, neither urinary osmolality (Uosm) nor hypothalamic AVP mRNA was significantly changed after 24 h of fluid deprivation (Uosm, 413 +/- 33 to 588 +/- 44, NS; AVP mRNA, 39.33 +/- 2.95 to 46.39 +/- 2.71 pg/micrograms total RNA, NS). In contrast, when Brattleboro rats were treated with AVP for 2 wk, the regulation of AVP gene occurred in response to 24 h of fluid deprivation. In these studies, hypothalamic AVP mRNA was significantly increased compared with the Brattleboro rats still receiving AVP with free access of water (28.9 +/- 3.5 vs. 65.0 +/- 3.3 pg/micrograms total RNA, P less than 0.001). Further studies in Long-Evans rats demonstrate a similar response to a comparable degree of fluid deprivation as Uosm and AVP mRNA were significantly increased after 72 h of fluid deprivation (Uosm, 1,505 +/- 186 to 5,460 +/- 560 mosmol/kg, P less than 0.001; AVP mRNA, 31.7 +/- 3.9 to 77.5 +/- 4.6 pg/micrograms total RNA, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that AVP-replaced homozygous Brattleboro rats can regulate AVP gene expression normally in response to fluid deprivation. This finding indicates that the defect in AVP gene regulation in the Brattleboro rat not receiving AVP replacement is a secondary phenomenon rather than a primary genetic defect.\r"

Endotoxin also causes liberation of the vasoactive cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in culture. This study tested whether defects in contractility could be induced in isolated vascular tissue by prolonged exposure to endotoxin (1-100 ng/ml) in vitro, and whether IL-1 and TNF release by blood vessels is altered during the establishment of endotoxin induced contractile dysfunction. A concentration of endotoxin as low as 1 ng/ml suppressed contractions to norepinephrine (NE) and KCl; aortic sensitivity to NE also decreased. The presence of serum constituents or an intact endothelium were not necessary for endotoxin-induced vascular suppression. Aortas incubated with endotoxin liberated IL-1 and TNF in a dose-dependent fashion. The addition of dexamethasone or indomethacin during the incubations generally suppressed release of the cytokines and improved tissue reactivity to NE. The endotoxin-induced diminished vascular contraction and augmented IL-1 and TNF liberation required de novo protein synthesis; tissue incubated with endotoxin plus actinomycin D was completely shielded from the influence of endotoxin on vascular reactivity to NE. The association between endotoxin-induced vascular cytokine release and diminished contraction suggests a possible role for cytokines derived from the vasculature in the regulation of contractile function.\r"

This enzyme is synthesized as a 43-kD proenzyme and processed to the active 25-kD form. Differentiation of THP-1 cells in the presence of human serum resulted in an increase in the size of the vacuolar compartment and the accumulation of more 25-kD cathepsin L antigen, as compared with THP-1 cells differentiated in the presence of fetal calf serum. Cells cultured in both types of sera have equivalent levels of cathepsin L mRNA. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated equivalent rates of synthesis, processing to the active form, and persistence in both culture conditions. An extracellular source of enzyme was documented by immunoblotting human serum which demonstrated 25-kD cathepsin L antigen; furthermore, we demonstrated that both THP-1 cells, differentiated in human serum, and human alveolar macrophages take up the 43-kD proenzyme and process it to the 25-kD form. Thus, human serum contains a factor(s) that induces both a marked increase in the size of the vacuolar compartment in differentiated THP-1 cells and a novel pathway that is responsible for the uptake and processing of extracellular cathepsin L. The activity of this inducible pathway is a major determinant of levels of intracellular cathepsin L. Cathepsin L is a potent elastase and the regulation of its uptake and processing may play a role in the pathogenesis of disease processes characterized by the destruction of elastin, such as pulmonary emphysema.\r"

In this study, phagocytic cell (neutrophil and monocyte) respiratory burst activity, as measured by superoxide anion generation, oxygen consumption, and hexose monophosphate shunt activity, was markedly reduced in both neutrophils and monocytes from GSD 1b patients as compared with either GSD 1a patients or healthy adult control cells. Degranulation, unlike respiratory burst activity, was not significantly different in neutrophils from GSD 1b patients as compared with controls. Both neutrophils and monocytes from GSD 1b patients showed decreased ability to elevate cytosolic calcium in response to the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe. In addition, calcium mobilization in response to ionomycin was also attenuated suggesting decreased calcium stores. Thus, reduced phagocytic cell function in GSD 1b is associated with diminished calcium mobilization and defective calcium stores. Defective calcium signaling is associated with a selective defect in respiratory burst activity but not degranulation.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator directly releases fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB) from fibrinogen. The purpose of this study was to determine whether urokinase has similar activity. Incubation of urokinase with fibrinogen or heparinized plasma results in concentration-dependent FPB release unaccompanied by FPA cleavage. For equivalent amidolytic activity, high molecular weight urokinase releases twofold more FPB than the low molecular weight species. In contrast, prourokinase does not release FPB until activated to urokinase. Contaminating thrombin or plasma is not responsible for urokinase-mediated FPB release because this activity is unaccompanied by FPA or B beta 1-42 cleavage, and is unaffected by heparin, hirudin, a monospecific antibody against thrombin, aprotinin, or alpha 2-antiplasmin. FPB release reflects a direct action of urokinase on fibrinogen because release is completely inhibited by a monospecific antibody against the enzyme. Further, urokinase releases FPB from the FPB-containing substrate B beta 1-42, thus confirming its specificity for the B beta 14 (Arg)-B beta 15 (Gly) bond. In addition to FPB release, SDS-PAGE analysis of the time course of urokinase-mediated fibrinogenolysis indicates progressive proteolysis of both the A alpha- and B beta-chains of fibrinogen that occurs after FPB release is completed. As a consequence of urokinase-mediated fibrinogenolysis, there is progressive prolongation of the thrombin clotting time. These studies indicate that urokinase has direct catalytic activity against fibrinogen. By releasing FPB, a potent chemoattractant, and by rendering fibrinogen less clottable by thrombin, urokinase may participate in processes extending beyond fibrinolysis.\r"

Although this protein was localized to the surface of hepatocytes by immunofluorescence, immunoblot analysis revealed reactivity toward both plasma membrane and mitochondrial fractions. To clarify these findings, an immunoreactive clone from a rat liver cDNA expression library was isolated, the 1,500-base pair cDNA insert was sequenced, and the corresponding beta-galactosidase fusion protein was expressed and purified. The resulting sequence corresponded to that of the rat mitochondrial F1-adenosine triphosphatase (F1-ATPase) beta-subunit. This protein and OABP are of similar size and are mutually immunologically cross-reactive. That the antigen was present on the cell surface as well as in mitochondria was suggested from studies of immunoprecipitation after cell-surface iodination, and light- and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry. Photoaffinity labeling of bovine F1-ATPase with high-specific-activity [35S]sulfobromophthalein revealed binding only to the beta-subunit. Hepatocyte uptake of bilirubin and sulfobromophthalein requires cellular ATP and mitochondria also transport these organic anions, which at high doses inhibit respiration. The presence of an organic anion binding site on the F1-ATPase beta-subunit suggests that it may play a role in these processes.\r"

The LATs appear to modulate virus reactivation. In mice and rabbits the 5' origins, kinetics of synthesis, and splicing pattern of the LATs are well established. Because these details of LAT structure and expression have not been defined in humans, we sought to do so. Using primer extension and Northern hybridization analyses, we demonstrate that in human trigeminal ganglia, the smaller (1.35 kb) HSV-1 transcript differs from the larger (1.85 kb) LAT by excision of an intron near its 5' end; they are otherwise colinear, and 5' coterminal. In infected cells only the 1.85 kb LAT is detected. Its expression is inhibited by cycloheximide or acyclovir, indicating this LAT is synthesized late in the viral replicative cycle. All of these features of the LATs in humans are consistent with those reported in rabbits and mice and further validate the animal models of human HSV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "A defect in the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is one cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized a 1.35 kbp cDNA clone encoding the entire precursor of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH complex from a human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA clone (lambda hBE1 beta-1) contained a 5'-untranslated sequence of four nucleotides, the translated sequence of 1,176 nucleotides and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 169 nucleotides. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of the clone with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature bovine BCKDH-E1 beta subunit showed that the cDNA insert encodes for a 342-amino acid subunit with a Mr = 37,585. The subunit is synthesized as the precursor with a leader sequence of 50 amino acids and is processed at the NH2 terminus. A search for protein homology revealed that the primary structure of human BCKDH-E1 beta was similar to the bovine BCKDH-E1 beta and to the E1 beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in all regions. The structures and functions of mammalian alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are apparently highly conserved. Genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal and five MSUD patients, in whom E1 beta was not detected by immunoblot analysis, gave the same restriction maps on Southern blot analysis. The gene has at least 80 kbp.\r"

Two monoclonal antibodies reacting with distinct epitopes in the amino-terminal domain of the alpha-chain of glycoprotein (GP) Ib were used to estimate the number of GP Ib molecules on the platelet membrane. In the patient, binding of one antibody (LJ-Ib10) was approximately 50% of normal, while binding of the other (LJ-Ib1) was absent. Binding of both antibodies was reduced to approximately 50% of normal in the mother and one sister of the propositus, and their platelets exhibited approximately 70% of normal von Willebrand factor binding. Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of GP Ib alpha, as well as GP IX, in patient platelets. Antibody LJ-Ib10, but not LJ-Ib1, could immunoprecipitate the patient's GP Ib alpha from surface-labeled proteins. Thus, platelets from the propositus contained a structurally and functionally altered GP Ib-IX complex lacking a specific antibody epitope and the ability to bind von Willebrand factor. In contrast, the binding of human alpha-thrombin to the patient's platelets was normal, and three classes of binding sites with high, intermediate, and low affinity could be detected. These studies define a distinct variant form of Bernard-Soulier syndrome and provide evidence, based on a naturally occurring mutant molecule, that the amino-terminal region of GP Ib alpha contains a von Willebrand factor-binding domain distinct from the high affinity thrombin-binding site. Use of different monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitope specificities appears to be essential for a correct identification of variant Bernard-Soulier syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The nucleotide sequence was determined for all 22 exons of the insulin receptor gene from three patients with genetic syndromes associated with extreme insulin resistance. In all three patients, insulin resistance was caused by decreased insulin binding to the cell surface. The patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun/Winnipeg) came from a consanguineous pedigree and was homozygous for a missense mutation substituting arginine for His209 in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor. The other two patients were both compound heterozygotes with a nonsense mutation in one allele of the insulin receptor gene, and a missense mutation in the other allele. In the patient with the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (patient RM-1), the missense mutation substituted lysine for Asn15 in the alpha-subunit. In the patient with type A extreme insulin resistance (patient A-1), the missense mutation substituted serine for Asn462 in the alpha-subunit. Both nonsense mutations markedly reduced the levels of insulin receptor mRNA transcribed from the alleles with the nonsense mutation as compared to the transcripts from the other allele. The reduction in the level of mRNA would be predicted to greatly reduce the rate at which the truncated receptors would be synthesized. Furthermore, the truncated receptors would be severely impaired in their ability to mediate insulin action.\r"

A battery of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies to HSV glycoprotein B (gB), and polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides of predicted epitopes of HSV glycoprotein D (gD) were used to determine in vitro functional activity and association with protection against lethal infection in a murine model of neonatal HSV disease. Antiviral neutralization activity of HSV was not associated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity to HSV-infected cells in vitro. In a model of high dose challenge (10(4) PFU), protection was not afforded by any antibody alone, but was by antibody plus human mononuclear cells, and highly associated with ADCC functional activity (P less than 0.001). In a low dose challenge model, neutralizing activity of antibody alone was associated with protection in vivo (P less than 0.001). Of the nine neutralizing epitopes of gD in vitro, eight were predicted surface regions. Four of the five epitopic sites of gD (2-21, 267-276, 288-297, and 303-312) that were determined to be important targets of ADCC and in vivo protection were also predicted to be surface regions. The only exception was the antiserum to region 52-61 which was predicted to be buried and also showed these activities. ADCC as well as neutralizing antibody activity are important in protection against neonatal HSV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac myofibrils from cardiomyopathic hamsters exhibit elevated Mg2+ ATPase activity and a parallel upward shift of the calcium ATPase dose response curve. To explore the mechanism, myofibrils from control and cardiomyopathic hamster hearts were incubated with isolated troponin-tropomyosin complex (Tn.Tm) from cardiomyopathic and control hamster or from dog hearts. Tn.Tm from control hamster or dog hearts restored normal Mg2+ ATPase activities to myofibrils from myopathic hearts. However, the maximum ATPase response to calcium stimulation was less in cardiomyopathic myofibrils compared to controls, even when control Tn.Tm was included. Electrophoretic patterns of Tn.Tm from myopathic and control hearts were similar. Electrophoresis of the hamster myofibrils mixed with dog cardiac Tn.Tm and then washed demonstrated binding of this complex to myopathic myofibrils. To further confirm that the incubation experiments resulted in binding, 125I troponin-tropomyosin was cross-hybridized with myofibrils, extensively washed, and then analyzed enzymatically and autoradiographically. Autoradiograms demonstrated similar percent binding of 125I Tn.Tm to all myofibrillar preparations and enzymatic effects like those found using cold Tn.Tm. These studies suggest that Tn.Tm from cardiomyopathic hearts inhibits Mg2+ myofibrillar ATPase activity to a lesser degree than Tn.Tm from control hearts. Decreased stimulation by calcium in myopathic preparations may be due to abnormalities in troponin-tropomyosin and/or to the decreased myosin ATPase activity observed previously.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of progressive increases in intraluminal glucose concentration on proximal tubule sodium absorption was studied in normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats by microperfusion. Each tubule was perfused twice, with and without glucose added to the perfusion fluid. Net sodium and water absorption were markedly enhanced by 300-500 mg% intraluminal glucose in both normal and diabetic rats. Substituting the transported but nonmetabolized glucose analogue, alpha-methyl D-glucoside for glucose also resulted in marked stimulation of sodium absorption, whereas substituting bicarbonate and acetate for chloride in the perfusion solution inhibited the effect of glucose. These observations suggest that the stimulation of sodium absorption by glucose was mediated by the brush border Na/glucose cotransporter. Sodium concentration and osmolality were found to fall markedly to hypotonic levels when high glucose concentrations were in the perfusion fluid. This luminal hypotonicity may be an important driving force for proximal fluid absorption. In poorly controlled diabetes, high filtered glucose concentrations may lead to enhanced proximal sodium and water absorption, which could in turn contribute to volume expansion, hypertension, and renal hypertrophy.\r"

Low-dose continuous infusion techniques employing [2H5]phenylalanine and [2H2]tyrosine were used to quantitate in vivo phenylalanine hydroxylation in 10 subjects with classical phenylketonuria, 2 with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and 7 controls. Plasma phenylalanine concentration ranged from 523 to 1,540 mumols/liter in PKU, 402 to 533 in HPA, and 49 to 54 in controls. Subjects with classical PKU hydroxylated mean +/- SD 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumols/kg per h (range 0.9-8.4) of phenylalanine to tyrosine and those with HPA 4.4 and 5.3, respectively. These rates were substantial in comparison with those in controls (6.3 +/- 1.6, 3.2-8.2). The significant hydroxylation in PKU and HPA subjects is likely to result from induction of activity of tyrosine hydroxylase towards phenylalanine by the greatly elevated phenylalanine concentration. The presence of such activity in PKU suggests that therapy aimed at promotion of this usually latent hydroxylating capacity may be a future alternative to dietary treatment of PKU.\r"

All bath solutions contained L-glutamine as the ammoniagenic substrate. High bath and luminal K+ concentrations (8 mM), but not high luminal K+ concentration alone, inhibited total ammonia production rates by 26%, while low bath and luminal K+ concentrations (2 mM), but not low luminal K+ concentration alone, stimulated total ammonia production rates by 33%. The stimulation of ammonia production by low bath K+ concentration was not observed when L-glutamine was added to the luminal perfusion solution. On the other hand, high luminal K+ concentration stimulated, while low luminal K+ concentration inhibited, net luminal secretion of total ammonia in a way that was: (a) independent of total ammonia production rates, (b) independent of Na(+)-H+ exchange activity, and (c) not due to changes in transepithelial fluxes of total ammonia. These results suggest that luminal potassium concentration has a direct effect on cell-to-lumen transport of ammonia.\r"

Recent studies have shown that CCK may play a permissive role in the development of acute pancreatitis. In this study, the amount of luminal bile salts in female Swiss Webster mice was either decreased by feeding 4% (wt/wt) cholestyramine or increased by feeding 0.5% sodium taurocholate for 1 wk. Plasma levels of CCK were stimulated by cholestyramine and inhibited by taurocholate. Then, acute pancreatitis was induced either by caerulein injections, or by feeding a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Feeding of cholestyramine significantly decreased survival from 25% to 0% in the CDE pancreatitis, and increased the magnitude of elevation of serum amylase levels and the extent of pancreatic necrosis in both models of pancreatitis; CCK-receptor blockade with CR-1409 completely abolished the adverse effects of cholestyramine. In contrast, feeding of taurocholate significantly increased survival to 100% and decreased the elevation of serum amylase and pancreatic necrosis; CCK-8 antagonized these actions of taurocholate. Luminal bile salts appear to provide a physiologic protection against necrotizing pancreatitis, at least in part, both by inhibiting the release of CCK and by promoting resistance of the pancreas to CCK excessive stimulation in vivo.\r"

We recently isolated a 1.9-kb human cDNA clone which encodes one of these Ro autoantigens. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the human Ro sequence were used to amplify the homologous gene from a murine B cell cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction. The mouse cDNA-encoded amino acid sequence was found to be 94% homologous to the human Ro sequence and is 100% homologous to murine calreticulin, a high affinity calcium-binding protein which resides in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The amino acid sequence of rabbit calreticulin is 92% homologous to both murine calreticulin and human Ro. Onchocerca volvulus and Drosophila melanogaster also have molecules that are highly homologous to human Ro. In addition, human Ro has a molecular mass, isoelectric point, and significant amino acid sequence similar to the Aplysia californica snail neuronal protein 407. These homologies suggest that this Ro protein has a very basic cellular function(s) which may in part involve calcium binding.\r"

We investigated the clonal origin of pituitary tumors using X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the phosphoglycerate kinase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase genes. Restriction enzymes were used to distinguish maternal and paternal X-chromosomes, and combined with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme to analyze allelic X-inactivation patterns in six pituitary adenomas. All six tumors showed a monoclonal pattern of X-inactivation. These data indicate that nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas are unicellular in origin, a result consistent with the hypothesis that this tumor type is due to somatic mutation.\r"

The abnormality of expression of Fc receptor III was limited to the patient's neutrophils (her natural killer cells reacted normally with anti-Fc receptor III antibodies), and was associated with abnormal recognition and binding of IgG-coated erythrocytes. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed evidence that failure of the patient's neutrophils to express Fc receptor III was most likely due to an abnormality of the gene that encodes this receptor.\r"

We examined the molecular basis for argininemia by constructing a genomic library followed by cloning and DNA sequencing. Discrete mutations were found on two alleles from the patient, a product of a nonconsanguineous marriage. There was a four-base deletion at protein-coding region 262-265 or 263-266 in exon 3 that would lead to a reading-frame shift after amino acid residue 87 and make a new stop codon at residue 132. The other was a one-base deletion at 77 or 78 in exon 2 that would lead to a reading-frame shift after residue 26 and make a stop codon at residue 31. For confirmation, genomic DNAs from the patient and from her parents were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method. The patient was shown to be a compound heterozygote, inheriting an allele with the four-base deletion from the father and the other allele with the one-base deletion from the mother. These data seem to be the first evidence of a case of argininemia caused by two different deletion mutations.\r"

Cultured skin fibroblasts were obtained from two independent patients with abnormal prolidase. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we amplified the entire coding region of human prolidase mRNA derived from patients' fibroblasts. Nucleotide sequence analysis of amplified cDNA products revealed a G to A substitution at position 826 in exon 12, where aspartic acid was replaced by asparagine at the amino acid residue 276, in cells from both patients. An analysis of the DNA showed that the substitution was homozygous. An expression plasmid clone containing a normal human prolidase cDNA (pEPD-W) or mutant prolidase cDNA (pEPD-M) was prepared, transfected, and tested for expression in NIH 3T3 cells. Incorporation of pEPD-W and pEPD-M resulted in the synthesis of an immunological polypeptide that corresponded to human prolidase. Active human enzyme was detected in cells transfected with pEPD-W, but not in those transfected with pEPD-M. These results were compatible with our observation of fibroblasts and confirmed that the substitution was responsible for the enzyme deficiency. As active prolidase was recovered in prolidase-deficient fibroblasts transfected with pEPD-W, this restoration of prolidase activity after transfection means that gene replacement therapy for individuals with this human disorder can be given due consideration.\r"

TGF-alpha and EGF-R are both known to be expressed in colon carcinoma tissue and have been shown coexpressed in colon carcinoma cell lines. TGF-alpha autocrine activation of EGF-R has been suggested as a potential mechanism contributing to abnormal growth control in colon cancer. We now report coexpression of TGF-alpha and EGF-R transcripts in morphologically normal colonic epithelium from five individuals, in colonic adenomas from three individuals, and in a nontumorigenic colon adenoma cell line, VACO-330. Functional studies demonstrate VACO-330 growth is stimulated by exogenous TGF-alpha and is completely abolished by a blocking anti-EGF-R antibody. Autocrine stimulation of EGF-R by TGF-alpha is therefore required for growth of the adenoma cell line. Autocrine stimulation of EGF-R by TGF-alpha does not cause malignant transformation of the colonic epithelial cell. In normal and adenomatous human colon TGF-alpha, via either an autocrine or paracrine mechanism, is likely an important physiologic stimulant of epithelial proliferation.\r"

The cytotoxicity was observed under phase optics and by immunoelectron microscopy, and was quantitated with a chromium release assay. Myotubes were efficiently killed by allospecific CTL and by autologous and allogeneic NK cells. The killing by CTL was inhibited with an anti-class I HLA MAb, and the killing by NK cells was inhibited by depleting peripheral blood cells of CD16+ cells with anti-CD16 MAb and complement.

We have performed linkage studies in these two kindreds (5 affected males, 11 obligate carrier females, and 44 unaffected members) and have used cloned human X chromosome sequences identifying restriction fragment length polymorphisms to localize the mutant gene causing this disorder. Our studies established linkage between the X-linked recessive idiopathic hypoparathyroid gene (HPT) and the DXS98 (4D.8) locus, peak LOD score = 3.82 (theta = 0.05), thereby mapping HPT to the distal long arm of the X chromosome (Xq26-Xq27). Multilocus analysis indicated that HPT is proximal to the DXS98 (4D.8) locus but distal to the F9 (Factor IX) locus, thereby revealing bridging markers for the disease. The results of this study will improve genetic counseling of affected families, and further characterization of this gene locus will open the way for elucidating the factors controlling the development and activity of the parathyroid glands.\r"

Stimulation of AC by either arginine vasopressin (AVP) or forskolin or addition of exogenous cAMP inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated PLC. This inhibition is mediated by activation of cAMP-dependent kinase as it is prevented by pretreatment with the A-kinase inhibitor, N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide (H8) but not by the C-kinase inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7). Exposure to EGF eliminates AVP-stimulated cAMP generation. This is not mediated by a cyclooxygenase product as inhibition by EGF is observed even in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen. Inhibition by EGF is not due to an increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) as exposure of saponin-permeabilized cells to exogenous IP3 is without effect. Inhibition by EGF is prevented by pretreatment with the C-kinase inhibitor, H7, but not by the A-kinase inhibitor, H8. Exposure to the synthetic diacylglycerol (DAG), dioctanoylglycerol, also inhibits AVP-stimulated AC activity; therefore, inhibition by EGF is due to activation of protein kinase C. Thus, in cultured rat inner medullary collecting duct cells, cAMP and DAG function as mutually inhibitory second messengers with each impairing formation of the other.\r"

DNA purified from SLE plasma formed discrete bands, corresponding to sizes of about 150-200, 400, 600, and 800 bp, closely resembling the characteristic 200 bp \"ladder\" found with oligonucleosomal (ON) DNA. By radiolabeling DNA while in whole plasma, the very small amounts present could be further characterized. All of 24 such specimens formed two or more discrete bands on 6% PAGE. Detergent treatment of plasma resulted in a DNA migration pattern similar to that of purified DNA, suggesting disruption of DNA-protein complexes. DNA purified from authentic ON and detergent-treated ON behaved similarly. A significant portion of DNA, labeled in SLE plasma could be specifically immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antihistone antibody as was the case with ON. These immunoprecipitates, when redissolved, exhibited the expected size distribution upon PAGE. It is concluded that DNA in SLE plasma occurs as a series of multimeric complexes, at least a portion of which is noncovalently bound to histone. These results are consistent with an ON-like structure for SLE plasma DNA as had been suggested by theoretical considerations and may have important implications for its immunologic behavior in SLE and perhaps other disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Inactivation of fibronectin (Fn) binding by insertional mutagenesis of Streptococcus sanguis with Tn916 reduces virulence of this bacterium in the rat model of infective endocarditis (IE). Transconjugants were screened for Fn adherence using an ELISA adherence test. One transconjugant had a decreased adherence to immobilized Fn. Southern hybridization demonstrated that the insertion occurred only once in this mutant. The parent strain and mutant strain JL113 were used as challenge strains in a rat endocarditis model. These experiments demonstrated that the mutant had a reduced ability (P less than 0.05) to produce IE. Spontaneous excision of Tn916 from JL113 produced strains identical to both the parental and mutant phenotypes. One strain (JLR-19) that retained the mutant phenotype and one (JLR-15) that regained the parental phenotype for Fn binding were tested for their ability to produce IE. These strains demonstrated that the ability to bind Fn and to produce IE were correlated after Tn916 excision. The reduced virulence of the mutant suggested that adherence of S. sanguis to immobilized Fn plays an important role in the production of IE.\r"

  ".W": "The direct vasoactive effects of native and oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins as well as their effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5-hydroxytryptamine were studied in isolated rings of pig right coronary artery. Slowly developing contractions were caused by native low density lipoproteins (100 micrograms protein/ml). The contractions were more pronounced in the absence than in the presence of the trace metal chelator, EDTA, and coincided with the formation of lipid peroxides during the response. The lipophilic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene, prevented the oxidation of, and contraction to, native low density lipoproteins. Low density lipoproteins oxidized by exposure to copper contracted coronary arteries more rapidly with a threshold of only 1 micrograms protein/ml, but with a similar maximal contraction at 100 micrograms protein/ml. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the contraction to native low density lipoproteins, but not to oxidized low density lipoproteins. Catalase blocked contractions to both native and oxidized low density lipoproteins. Contractions to oxidized low density lipoproteins were unaffected by indomethacin, but were abolished by removal of the endothelium or by inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Oxidized low density lipoproteins but not native low density lipoproteins inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5-hydroxytryptamine. Thus, oxidized low density lipoproteins caused endothelium-dependent coronary artery contractions which are mediated by a hydroperoxide. Contractions to native low density lipoproteins are due to their oxidation in the organ chamber by the superoxide anion radical. Oxidized, but not native, low density lipoproteins impair normal endothelial cell vasodilator function in vitro. Oxidized low density lipoproteins, important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, may directly contribute to the increased risk of vasospasm seen in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with primary malignant brain tumors manifest a variety of abnormalities in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Diminished T cell reactivity has been shown in these patients to be linked to deficiencies in interleukin 2 (IL-2) production that cannot be overcome by exogenous IL-2. In this study, specific binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from brain tumor patients demonstrates that the number of high affinity interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R) is greatly reduced. FACS analysis indicates that the relative density of the p55 protein (Tac protein) is lower on the mitogen-activated lymphocytes obtained from patients than on comparably treated lymphocytes from normal individuals. These data indicate that mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes obtained from patients have fewer functional high affinity IL-2R principally because of the failure to express sufficient levels of the p55 protein for association with the p75 protein. Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from mitogen-stimulated T cells from patients demonstrates normal levels of steady state mRNA, which codes for the p55 protein. Moreover, there is no defect in the postranslational processing of the primary translation product of this mRNA suggesting that normal levels of the p55 protein are produced in activated T cells from patients.\r"

  ".W": "In experiments to ascertain the biochemical basis of a genetically determined deficiency of the third component of complement (C3) in guinea pigs, we found that C3-deficient liver and peritoneal macrophages contain C3 messenger RNA of normal size (approximately 5 kb) and amounts, that this mRNA programs synthesis of pro-C3 in oocytes primed with liver RNA and in primary macrophage cultures. In each instance, heterodimeric native C3 protein was secreted with normal kinetics but the C3 protein product of the deficient cells failed to undergo autolytic cleavage and was unusually susceptible to proteolysis. These data and a selective failure of C3 in plasma of deficient animals to incorporate [14C]methylamine suggested either a mutation in primary structure of the C3 protein or a selective defect in co- or postsynthetic processing affecting the thiolester bridge, a structure important for C3 function. A mutation in the primary structure of C3 was ruled out by comparison of direct sequence analysis of C3 cDNA generated from two C3 deficient and two C3 sufficient guinea pig liver libraries. Three base pair differences, none resulting in derived amino acid sequence differences were identified. Finally, restriction fragment length polymorphisms were identified in the C3 gene that are independent of the deficiency phenotype. This marker of the C3 gene permits testing of these hypotheses using molecular biological and classical genetic methods.\r"

The differentiation of these tumors from benign pilomatrixomas depends on a constellation of microscopic features, some of which may be equivocal or absent in individual biopsy specimens. We encountered a tumor with distinct pilomatrix differentiation (lobulated nests of basaloid cells, ghost cells, focal calcification) that recurred multiple times and ultimately invaded the cranial vault. Despite this aggressive behavior, the tumor was difficult to separate from benign pilomatrixoma on morphologic grounds. Because DNA content flow cytometry has proved useful in the prediction of aggressive behavior in various solid tumors, we analyzed this neoplasm by flow cytometry. Neither aneuploid peaks nor a high proliferative fraction were seen in this example of pilomatrix carcinoma.\r"

This difference indicates that the patients with melanoma were more susceptible to prolonged ultraviolet radiation-induced skin damage than the control subjects. Prolonged erythema response was significantly associated in the melanoma group with decreased minimal erythema doses (odds ratio [OR] = 11.3) and with the presence of freckles (OR = 5.5), and was associated in the control group with light eye color (OR = 5.8).

In 18 of these 28 patients no keratoses were noted on admission. In 9 of 10 patients who had keratoses at admission, there was an increase in number at discharge. All patients with keratoses on admission had multiple, closely spaced previous admissions. No age, sex, or skin type predominance was evident in the group with keratoses compared with the remainder of the group (24 patients) who did not have keratoses. The development of keratoses was not related to the type or duration of psoriasis. Statistically significant predisposing factors were the number of UVB and PUVA treatments and the number of inpatient admissions. Fifty-two percent were located on the extremities, 33% on the trunk, and 15% on the face, head, and neck. Histologic examination of these lesions suggested that they may be a variant of seborrheic keratoses. We have not seen these lesions on patients receiving UVB, PUVA, or tar therapy for other diseases. This raises the possibility that these lesions may be unique to psoriasis and most likely are related to long-term therapy.\r"

Anthralin-induced inflammation was inhibited on the triethanolamine-treated side whereas anthralin therapy had to be temporarily stopped in 18 patients on the aqueous cream side because of anthralin-induced inflammation. Therapeutic response was not different in the two sides. This study shows that anthralin-induced inflammation and its therapeutic effect can be dissociated.\r"

  ".W": "A group of 420 neonates underwent total cutaneous and oral mucosal examinations during the first week of life. Skin lesions were seen in almost every baby (99.3%). The eight most common dermatoses were desquamation (65.0%), Epstein's pearls (56.0%), sebaceous hyperplasia (48.0%), milia (36%), toxic erythema (34.8%), salmon patch (33.8%), hypertrichosis (29.0%), and Mongolian spot (25.5%). Congenital melanocytic nevi were clinically diagnosed in 9 of 420 babies (2.1%); the majority of the lesions were small, that is, less than 1.5 cm in diameter. These neonates had a dark complexion (all had brown or black hair, and most had an olive skin color) and came from families with no previous history of cutaneous melanoma. In contrast, all 19 babies with a previous family history of melanoma had a fair complexion (blond or light brown hair and alabaster skin color) but no congenital melanocytic nevi. These findings may suggest that small congenital melanocytic nevi are markers for persons with a decreased risk of melanoma, because dark-skinned persons are at a lower risk. On the other hand, small congenital melanocytic nevi may be precursors of melanoma. Only prospective studies will determine the magnitude of this risk and thereby optimize management.\r"

Likewise, sucrose-rich diets are poorly accepted by uremic rats, which suggests that uremia causes a relative aversion for sucrose. Hemodialyzed children (no. = 39, mean age = 160 mo) and healthy controls (no. = 25, mean age = 122 mo) were compared for perception of sweet taste intensity in two familiar foods (soft white cheese and apple sauce) and for preference for sweetness. The food stimuli were prepared in five sucrose concentrations: 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% for cheese; 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 60% for apple sauce. Children were presented with pairs of stimuli of adjacent concentrations and asked, in a forced choice, to identify the sweeter stimulus and to express their preferences. The hemodialyzed children made more mistakes (19%) than the controls (5%) when asked to rank sweetness in the soft cheese (i.e., with low concentrations). Both groups made an equal number of mistakes when asked to rank sweetness in the apple sauce. Preferences for sweetness were markedly different. In cheese, the highest sucrose concentration was preferred by 21.9% of the hemodialyzed children vs 41% of the controls. The lowest sucrose concentration was selected by 15.6% of the hemodialyzed children vs 4.6% of the controls. Similar preference trends were observed for apple sauce. We conclude that abnormally low preferences for sweet foods can contribute to insufficient caloric intake in uremic children.\r"

Analysis with chi square (p less than .05) compared pre-semester responses (no. = 279) and post-semester responses (no. = 218) with those of 24 senior dietetics students (dietetics majors). After completing the course, all basic nutrition students responded that they had learned a lot about nutrition, and 45% indicated that they had made dietary changes because of this learning. Changes included increased confidence in the adequacy of their diets, decreased supplement use, and reduced fat content of milk usually consumed. Some misunderstandings of carbohydrates in foods were not improved. The similarity of responses by basic nutrition and control students to the pre-semester questionnaire suggests that enrollees in a basic nutrition class may be representative of the general student body in needs for nutrition education. The basic class for non-nutrition majors can effect changes in dietary practices; their nutrition education needs may be used to plan nutrition education of the general student population.\r"

Data pertaining to demographics and pre-competition nutrition, training, health, and drug abuse practices were collected by self-administered and interview surveys and records. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements and casual blood samples were collected on -site at the competition registration. Multi-drug abuse was reported by 15% to 40% of the subjects, and 20% to 40% of subjects left the drug use questions unanswered. Severe fluid restrictions and dehydrating practices were reported by all subjects. Eleven men and two women agreed to have blood drawn. Plasma glucose values were at the low end of the normal fasting range. Hemoglobin levels were elevated, indicating hypohydration; magnesium levels were slightly low. Percent body fat, estimated by seven-site skinfold measures, was low for both sexes (men, 6.0 +/- 1.8; women, 9.8 +/- 1.5); 75% of the women reported normal menstrual cycles. The men reported high-protein, low-fat hypocaloric diet patterns. Women had a moderate zinc intake and a remarkably deficient calcium intake despite an adequate energy intake. This research demonstrates that bodybuilders partake in a multitude of practices that may place them in high-risk health categories. It is essential that health care workers in contact with bodybuilding athletes intervene and educate them about healthy dietary and training alternatives.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to analyze the effect of vitamin B-6 supplementation on the lipoprotein profile of chronic hemodialysis patients. Individuals on chronic hemodialysis experience an acceleration of atherosclerosis, which is often accompanied by abnormal lipid metabolism. Although total plasma cholesterol is usually normal, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is often low. Recently, it has been suggested that the development of atherosclerotic lesions in chronic hemodialysis patients may be the result of a decreased plasma concentration of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and concomitant alterations in plasma amino acid and/or lipoprotein profiles. All subjects in this study were supplemented with 0.97 mmol (200 mg) pyridoxine hydrochloride per day for 28 days; then, concentrations of PLP, total cholesterol, and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions were determined in the plasma. No significant difference was noted in PLP concentration between Group 1 (five post-menopausal women with a history of atherosclerosis who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis therapy) and Group 2 (six subjects who were non-symptomatic). However, both groups had significant increases in PLP concentrations between the pre- and post-supplementation periods (p less than .01). In contrast, there was a statistically significant difference in total plasma cholesterol and very-low-density- and low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL and LDL) cholesterol concentrations between groups, but no significant changes in total cholesterol or VLDL and LDL cholesterol content were found during vitamin B-6 supplementation. No statistically significant differences in HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol concentrations were observed between Group 1 and Group 2 subjects or within either group during vitamin B-6 supplementation.\r"

Results indicate that grade point average, success in professional and physiological/biological science courses, and former employment were the most important criteria to a majority of respondents. Extensive write-in comments indicated that a grade of C or less in upper-level professional, basic sciences, and management/business courses reduced the competitive edge; in some cases, a C excluded the student from an appointment. The importance of the application packet, application letter, and their neatness and accuracy was also stressed. Directors desired letters of reference that provided insight about the student not readily available in the application information, e.g., flexibility and dependability. In summary, directors are looking for an overall academically strong student with good references and some work experience (either paid or volunteer) that seems to fit with a career choice in dietetics.\r"

We have investigated molecular and endocrine aspects of that decrease by examining the effects of age and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on rat aorta elastogenesis. For comparison, pulmonary elastogenesis was examined in the same experimental animals. Different aged groups of male Fischer 344 rats (barrier protected) were implanted with minipumps for a two-week infusion of either 0.1 N acetic acid (vehicle solution) or IGF-I (1.2 mg/kg/day). The DNA content (micrograms DNA/g tissue) decreased with age in aorta but remained fairly constant in lung. Administration of IGF-I increased the aortic DNA content in all but the oldest rats. Conversely, the DNA content of pulmonary tissue was significantly increased in only the youngest animals. The steady-state levels of tropoelastin mRNA decreased dramatically in both aorta and lung with increased age. The decrease was greater in lung than aorta. Administration of IGF-I elevated aortic tropoelastin mRNA steady-state levels, whereas lung tropoelastin mRNA levels were unaffected by IGF-I administration. Aortic tissue synthesized decreased amounts of insoluble elastin with increased age. These results establish a direct relationship between aortic tropoelastin mRNA levels and the synthesis of insoluble elastin in aging. Administration of IGF-I increased aortic elastin synthesis throughout the life span of the rat, although the proportionate increase diminished with age.\r"

Three of the five methods indicated that the percent body fat was significantly greater in the elderly age group. Similarly, three methods estimated FFM values that were significantly lower in the elderly group. In the young group the SKF-DW and TBW methods produced percent fat estimates significantly higher than the other three methods. In the elderly group the percent fat estimates were as follows: SKF-DW greater than BIA greater than SKF-JP = TBW greater than BMI. FFM estimates in both age groups were in inverse rank order to the percent fat estimates. In elderly subjects SKF-DW produced results closest to those from BIA, whereas in young subjects SKF-JP provided the best agreement with the BIA procedure.\r"

For this reason, we investigated the nutrient absorption in mice of different ages of the life span, representing growth (3 mo), young adult (12 mo), mature (24 mo), old (30 mo), and very old (33-36 mo) periods. The everted sac technique was used to study the transepithelial transport of D-glucose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3MG), and L-tyrosine. There was a 32% increase in the rate of D-glucose transepithelial transport during growth followed by a 55% decrease in the old mouse, and the same pattern occurred with 3MG, a nonmetabolized glucose derivative. However, L-tyrosine transepithelial transport was not impaired until the mouse reached the very old, 33-36 mo period. Also, the rate of D-glucose metabolism measured by lactate production in the very old mouse was only 45% of the mature mouse value. In addition, these transepithelial transport changes were accompanied by decreases in the number and the height of villi. The results indicate that intestinal transepithelial transport and the surface area for absorption decrease in aging.\r"

Cross-modal matches of distance to perceived intensity were obtained for five types of oral stimuli (sugar water, salt water, heated or chilled water, water thickened with methylcellulose, and local pressure on the dorsal tongue). Differences among stimulus types were observed for measures of response size (mean, median, maximum, and range of response distance and rate of increase with stimulus strength), but not measures of judgment quality, repeatability (ICC), and conformity to a linear rise with stimulus strength (r2). Age had no significant effect on any of the response measures for any stimulus type except pressure. All measures of response to lingual pressure except median size declined significantly with age. We conclude that (a) the various oral stimulus types elicit perceptions that differ in intensity but were judged with similar accuracy, and that (b) aging brings a specific decline in the perception of localized lingual pressure while both size and accuracy of intensity judgments are maintained for the other oral sensitivities tested.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the ability of sleep/wake measures to discriminate 45 control subjects from 44 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Sleep fragmentation was observed as indicated by significant increases in time awake (37-52%) and number of awakenings (31-36%) during the night as compared to controls. Further, slow wave sleep (SWS) was significantly reduced (22%) in AD patients relative to controls. These findings are consistent with our earlier observations of increased wakefulness and decreased SWS in mild-moderate, moderate-severe, and severe stage AD patients. However, when we used these sleep/wake stage measures in discriminant analyses to classify the current AD subjects vs control subjects, the analyses failed to confirm our earlier high classification rate (90%). The present groups were discriminated at overall classification rates of only 63-67%. We conclude that while sleep/wake patterns are significantly disturbed in AD, this phenomenon is not diagnostically useful for discrimination of mild stage AD.\r"

Using a two-stage growth model, we obtained a predicted baseline and slope for each man for self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. Correlations revealed that emotionality was positively related to the numbers of both physical and psychological symptoms reported at baseline, while extraversion was negatively related. However, regression analyses including age and both personality variables indicated that only emotionality was associated with level of symptom-reporting. Longitudinal analyses revealed that emotionality was unrelated to physical symptom slopes and only weakly related to psychological slopes. We interpret these results as showing that, while personality and symptom-reporting are related cross-sectionally, personality does not predict changes in symptom reporting.\r"

As expected, across the entire age range there was no correlation between age and digit span memory (r = .03), a strong negative correlation between age and fluid intelligence (r = -.78), and a modest positive correlation between age and crystallized intelligence (r = .27). In addition, older adults reported more physical (r = .36) and mental (r = .32) health problems than did younger adults. Of special interest was the finding that both self-reported physical and mental health accounted for significant variance in intelligence performance, particularly in older adults. Moreover, self-reported health accounted for a considerable portion of observed variance, even when age differences in self-reported health were statistically controlled.\r"

All subjects completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire, which measures the use and perceived effectiveness of a variety of cognitive and behavioral coping strategies in controlling and decreasing pain. Subjects also completed measures of pain, depression, and psychological distress. Data analysis revealed that there were no significant age differences in either the use or perceived effectiveness of pain coping strategies. Correlational analyses based on data combined from the different age groups suggested that, while certain pain coping strategies appear to be adaptive (e.g., coping self-statements), other coping strategies appear to be maladaptive (e.g., catastrophizing, diverting attention, increasing behavioral activities). Patients who rated their ability to decrease pain as relatively high, reported lower levels of depression and pain. These findings are consistent with a contextual perspective on coping which postulates that few, if any, age differences in coping are to be expected when individuals are coping with a similar life event.\r"

Results suggest that well-organized verbal prescription labels are more facilitative for the elderly and that additional efforts must be undertaken to improve the clarity of labeling on prescription drugs.\r"

It is surprising, therefore, to find an almost complete lack of reliable data describing the everyday lives of the elderly in terms of external components such as type of activities, locations, and companionship. The present study is an attempt to remedy this lack of information and thereby provide a basis for a better understanding of aging processes. Forty-nine mobile and independently living elderly people (mean age = 72.7) recorded their daily activities over a period of 6 months. During a randomly selected week per month they kept a prestructured diary about what activities they engaged in, where, when, and with whom. In addition, functional health and personal control beliefs were assessed. The diaries were coded along 37 activity categories (inter-rater reliability estimated via Cohen's Kappa: M = .93), 5 categories for location and 6 categories for companionship. The major findings can be summarized as follows: The typical activity profile is characterized, in terms of highest frequency, by obligatory activities. In terms of time, however, they make up but little more than half of the day, predominantly the mornings. Afternoons and evenings, were mostly spent with leisure activities. The paths of daily lives of the elderly were marked by two geographic domains. The first and foremost is the home, followed by public places. With regard to the relationship between activities and personal control, we find a close relationship particularly when functional health is low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data were obtained from published reports of the 1960, 1970, and 1980 U.S. Decennial Censuses and the 1985 U.S. Current Population Survey. Overall mobility rates consistently declined in all regions and periods, while interstate and interregional migration rates increased through 1980. In the period 1980-85 there were decreased numbers and rates of elderly out-migrants from the Midwest and Northeast, resulting in unprecedented declines in the net migration gains of older persons in the South. The likely persistence of these trends in the future and their explanation are discussed.\r"

Significant differences exist among older persons (based on gender, marital status, and availability of children) in the salience of these ties as confidants and companions. There are also major differences in the configuration of the confidant vs companion networks. These variations are discussed in the context of the hierarchical-compensation, task specificity, and functional specificity of relationships models of support. The findings demonstrate that a distinction regarding availability of kin must be made among those who never had a particular kin tie (e.g., the childless and single), those who have lost a previous tie (e.g., the widowed), and those whose tie lives far away.\r"

Intergenerational reciprocity was investigated using two competing theoretical perspectives, social exchange and equity propositions. Social exchange propositions predict a linear relationship between intergenerational aid and older parent morale, with higher morale positively related to giving or receiving more intergenerational help. Equity propositions predict that the intergenerational aid, morale relationship will be curvilinear, with higher older parent morale related to balanced exchanges of intergenerational aid. Neither theoretical perspective was supported by the data. Intergenerational aid was not useful in explaining variance in older parent morale regardless of the operational definition of intergenerational aid. These results provide support for earlier studies that conclude the amount of help exchanged within families does not affect the well-being of older family members.\r"

Since 25.6 percent of the subjects were Black, it was possible to examine race-related changes in health, function, and socioeconomic status over nine years, as well as differences in rates of institutionalization and mortality. Aging urban Blacks continue to experience major social disadvantages, especially in education and income. After age 74, although Blacks probably experience more favorable mortality rates and less institutionalization, they consider themselves less healthy and are more likely to develop diabetes, hypertension, and glaucoma. Although Blacks rate their own mental health lower, this difference is not supported by other measures. Functionally, elderly Whites are more likely to be dependent in certain activities of daily living. The findings are consistent with the previously observed mortality crossover; predictors of mortality are identified but do not differ by race. Lower institutionalization rates among older Blacks may be partly explained by different living patterns, poverty, and a higher proportion of males among surviving Blacks.\r"

  ".W": "In the process of generating culture supernatant from T cell clones, with anti-CD3 antibodies and the B lymphoma A20 as APC, a striking difference in the stimulation of TH1 and TH2 clones was observed, i.e., TH2 clones produced higher levels of lymphokines than TH1 clones. This prompted us to test the hypothesis that differential killing of APC (thus the removal of stimuli) by T cells led to differential T cell activation. By studying a panel of five TH1 and seven TH2 clones, it was demonstrated that TH1 clones mediated significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity toward A20 cells in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 antibody (as opposed to immobilized anti-CD3). Although T cell clones could, when activated with immobilized anti-CD3, produce lymphokines cytotoxic to A20 cells, experiments in which lymphokine production was blocked indicated that T cell clones, in the presence of soluble anti-CD3, mediated killing of A20 through direct cytotoxicity. A higher level of cytotoxicity, by TH1 compared with TH2 clones, was not restricted to anti-CD3 or a particular target cell type, because it also occurred with Con A- or Ag-dependent killing (a monocyte-macrophage cell line), and LPS blasts. Furthermore, the higher cytotoxic activity of TH1 clones compared with TH2 clones was independent of the stage of T cell activation and was unlikely a result of the length of in vitro culture. High levels of killing of APC led to low levels of T cell activation, the significance of which may be as a negative feedback mechanism in the immune response. Other biologic relevancies of higher cytotoxic activity in TH1 vs TH2 cells were also discussed.\r"

The potential of two stromal cell lines, S10 and S17, in this process was examined. Initial experiments, using a short term liquid culture, indicated that S10 and S17 stroma efficiently supported the generation of clonable B cells (B lymphocyte CFU) from their immediate precursors in fresh bone marrow. The contribution of macrophages and other accessory cells in those experiments was minimized through use of a colony assay system that permits the direct effects of stromal cell signals on single B cell progenitors to be evaluated. The results indicated that soluble mediators from the S10 and S17 lines could support colony formation from fresh or cultured surface Ig- bone marrow cells. Colonies supported by S17 stroma appeared on day 15 and contained cells that expressed the B220 Ag; surface IgM expression was never observed. S10 supported colonies appeared on day 7 and routinely included surface IgM+ cells. Individual colonies were capable of undergoing additional growth when picked and replated directly onto the different stroma. Those colonies replated onto S10 stroma generated surface IgM expressing cells in up to 60% of experiments, but colonies transferred onto the S17 cell line included B cells only 10% of the time. These data demonstrate that stromal cells alone can provide the signals necessary for generating a surface IgM+ B cell from precursors but that not all stromal cell lines are equally efficient at doing so.\r"

  ".W": "Ts1, or inducer suppressor T cells, share many phenotypic and functional characteristics with helper/inducer subset of T cells. In order to evaluate the relationship between these cell types, we made a series of new Ts1 hybridomas by the fusion of Ts1 cells with the functionally TCR alpha/beta-negative BW thymoma (BW 1100). Three Ts1 hybridomas (CKB-Ts1-38, CKB-Ts1-53, and CKB-Ts1-81) were established that express TCR and produce Ag-specific suppressor factors constitutively, thus making it possible to study the nature and specificity of Ag receptors, MHC restriction, and lymphokine production by the Ts1 hybridomas. Results presented in this report demonstrate that all the Ts1 hybridomas described here express CD3-associated TCR-alpha beta. These three Ts1 hybridomas recognize Ag (NP-KLH) specifically in a growth inhibition assay and this recognition is restricted by IE molecules. Two of the hybridomas also produce IL-2 or IL-2 and IL-4 upon Ag-specific activation. Thus, by these three criteria the Ts1 hybridomas appear indistinguishable from Th cells. These three Ts1 hybridomas, however, release suppressor factors (TsF1) in the supernatant that suppress both in vivo DTH and in vitro PFC responses in an Ag-specific manner. Like the TsF1 factors characterized previously, the suppression mediated by these factors are Igh restricted and lack H-2 restriction. These factors mediate suppression when given in the induction phase but not during the effector phase of the immune response. The TsF1 factors are absorbed by Ag (NP-BSA), and anti-TCR affinity columns and the suppressor activity can be recovered by elution. The data are consistent with the interpretation that Ts1 inducer-suppressor T cells are related to Th cells; the feature that distinguishes these cells is the ability to produce Ag-binding factors that specifically suppress immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "Human T cells spontaneously bind sheep E and this reflects physiologic interactions between specific adhesion molecules, principally T cell CD2, and the sheep equivalent of LFA-3. This interaction is important in T cell adhesion and in transmission of accessory activational signals. In this respect, E rosettes provide a partial analogue for T cell:accessory cell interaction and rosetting induces functional alterations in T cells. In studies of Ag-dependent T cell activation, we have obtained evidence that the formation of covalent Schiff bases between ligands on APC and T cell is an essential element. In our study, the specific chemical criteria defining Schiff base formation were applied to T cell E rosettes formed at room temperature, as follows: 1) Prior formation of Schiff bases on T cell epsilon-amino groups by glutaraldehyde inhibited E rosette formation. 2) Rosette formation was inhibited in the presence of exogenous lysine. 3) Reduction of constitutive T cell aldehydes by NaBH4 inhibited subsequent E rosette formation. In response to these chemical modifications of cellular ligands, T cell E rosette formation and T cell inductive interaction with APC were affected in the same way. 4) Oxidation of NaBH4-treated T cells by NaIO4 or galactose oxidase to regenerate cell-surface aldehydes on N-acetylneuraminic acid or galactose residues respectively, consistently restored E rosette formation. 5) Conversion of reversible Schiff bases to irreversible secondary amines by NaCNBH3 stabilized E rosettes against mechanical disruption. Together, these data demonstrate that E rosettes provide an analogue for the Schiff base-forming reactions that are essential in specific T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Murine B cell precursors can be induced to proliferate in culture if allowed to bind to bone marrow derived adherent cells prepared under specific conditions. We studied the binding of human B cell precursor subpopulations to various in vitro microenvironments to determine which conditions may potentially be suitable models for human B precursor differentiation. Using the markers CD10, CD34, and CD20, B lineage populations of increasing maturation were quantitated: CD10+/CD34+, CD10+/CD20-, CD10+/CD20+, and CD10-/CD20+ cells in marrow, and CD10-/CD20+ mature B cells in peripheral blood. The adhesion of subpopulations of blood and marrow-derived light density cells to adherent cell layers or matrix was studied following a 2-h incubation in 24-well plates. The absolute number of bound B lineage cells was determined by cell counts and flow cytometry analysis. The adherence of B lineage cells to passaged human marrow fibroblasts (BM-FB) was highest in the most immature CD10+/CD34+ cells (34.3 +/- 4.2%), decreasing steadily with each stage of maturation to the peripheral blood B cells (11.2 +/- 2.4%). Increased adhesion of CD10+ B cell precursors relative to CD10-/CD20+ marrow B cells was confirmed by adhesion studies using sorted cells. The two most immature B lineage cells (CD10+CD34+ and CD10+/CD20-) showed more adherence to BM-FB than any other cell type tested, except for monocytes. Only B lineage precursor cells, erythroid precursors and CD10-/CD34+ cells showed significantly greater binding to BM-FB than to plastic. B lineage precursors bound equally well to primary and passaged human marrow fibroblasts, but bound significantly less well to passaged human foreskin fibroblasts, primary human marrow stroma, extracellular matrix of marrow fibroblasts, or fibronectin. These results suggest that specific binding to marrow fibroblasts is part of the differentiation program of early B lineage precursors. This binding activity gradually and predictably decreases during B lineage differentiation, in contrast to expression of other binding receptors, such as LFA-1 and CD44, which increase during B lineage maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The immune response to allogeneic histocompatibility Ag can be suppressed by injecting allogeneic spleen cells into mice that have been previously exposed to UV radiation. The suppression is associated with Ag-specific suppressor T cells found in the spleens of the UV-irradiated mice. An intriguing and as yet unanswered question is how the irradiation of the animal's dorsal skin leads to the induction of splenic Ag-specific suppressor cells. Our data suggest that soluble factors released by UV-irradiated keratinocytes are involved in the induction of Ag-specific suppressor cells. Injecting culture supernatants from UV-irradiated keratinocytes into normal mice produced the same effect as whole-body UV irradiation and suppressed the induction of delayed hypersensitivity to alloantigen. Spleen cells from these mice were unable to respond to the alloantigen in the MLR. Radiation-resistant, suppressor T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8-) were found in the spleens of the mice injected with suppressive supernatants. Treating the keratinocytes with cycloheximide or treating the supernatants from the UV-irradiated keratinocytes with trypsin removed all suppressive activity, suggesting the active material is a protein. The suppressive activity bound to agarose beads coupled with Con A, and was eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, further suggesting the suppressive material is a glycoprotein. Because the suppression of the immune response to alloantigen induced by this suppressive cytokine mimicked the suppression found after exposure to UV radiation, these findings support the concept that the induction of systemic suppression by UV-irradiation results from the release of suppressive substances by UV-irradiated keratinocytes. In addition, these data suggest that the induction of Ag-specific suppressor cells by this factor may provide a novel method of suppressing allograft rejection.\r"

In 90% of the animals long term outgrowth of histologically normal C57BL thymus grafts was observed. None of the latter animals was chimeric. All thymus graft-bearing mice showed specific nonresponsiveness for C57BL MHC Ag in mixed lymphocyte reaction and cell-mediated lympholysis. Spleen cells of the C57BL thymus-bearing mice were unable to induce lethal graft-vs-host disease in neonatal (BALB/c X C57BL) F1 mice but provoked a vigorous graft-vs-host disease reaction in (BALB/c x C3H) F1 neonates. Tolerant mice permanently accepted C57BL heart and pancreas grafts, but all rejected C3H grafts. Induction of tolerance of BALB/c pre-T cells through allogeneic thymus graft and/or specific suppressor cells seems to be involved. The present model offers new opportunities to study thymocyte maturation in a fully allogeneic environment and may yield applications for clinical organ transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis can be adoptively transferred into naive recipients by lymphocytes from rats immunized with uveitogenic Ag, provided these cells are activated in vitro before being injected. The activation of sensitized lymphocytes, by the immunizing Ag, or by cross-reacting Ag, is usually accompanied by vigorous proliferation. We report, however, on a complete dissociation between the capacity of a peptide to generate uveitogenicity and to stimulate proliferation in cultured lymphocytes. This peptide, which occupies sequence 579-591 of the bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), is one of the three \"repeats\" that exhibit partial sequence homologies with the immunodominant and highly immunogenic peptide, 1179-1191. Peptide 579-591 is nonimmunogenic and nonuveitogenic in Lewis rats and does not stimulate any significant proliferation in lymphocytes sensitized against whole IRBP, peptide 1179-1191, or another \"repeat\" peptide, 271-283, which is immunogenic and uveitogenic. In contrast, peptide 579-591 effectively generates uveitogenicity in the lymphocytes sensitized against these three Ag. Unlike 579-591, peptides 271-283 and 1179-1191 stimulated both proliferation and uveitogenicity in these sensitized lymphocytes. A different pattern of activities was observed with the other \"repeat\" peptide, 880-892. This peptide did not have any effect on the lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP, 271-283 or 1179-1191, but did stimulate both proliferation and uveitogenicity in lymphocytes sensitized against itself. The data suggest that 579-591 selectively stimulates a lymphocyte subset that is uveitogenic, but is incapable of mounting proliferative responses.\r"

  ".W": "Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a candidate Ag for the autoimmune process believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). To investigate the fine specificity and HLA restriction of human MBP-specific CTL, long term T cell lines (TCL) were established from 22 MS patients and 16 healthy individuals by repeated antigenic restimulation. By using this approach, MBP-specific cytotoxic TCL were generated from 81% of the lines from MS patients and 69% of those from controls. TCL from both groups expressed the CD3+, CD4+, CD8- phenotype and secreted substantial amounts of IFN-gamma. By using large enzymatic and small synthetic peptides of MBP, TCL were primarily specific for the C-terminal part of the molecule and to a lesser extent for the N-terminal portion. Two regions of the molecule, MBP peptide 87-106 and MBP peptide 154-172, were recognized by the majority of the polyspecific lines and by four and three of 14 monospecific TCL, respectively. These highly immunogenic regions are of interest because they include sequences encephalitogenic in other species. The HLA restriction of each line was determined by using antibody blocking as well as various target cells including EBV-transformed B cells, homozygous typing cells, and fibroblasts transfected with cDNA for DR-alpha and DR-beta genes. All TCL were restricted by HLA-DR Ag. Several HLA-DR molecules restricted multiple cathepsin D-derived and synthetic MBP peptides, including the regions of peptides 87-106 and 154-172 which, respectively, were recognized in conjunction with four and three HLA-DR types. Three of these HLA-DR types are overrepresented in MS patients in different geographic regions. Together, these findings suggest that the MBP-specific cytotoxic T cell response, although not sufficient for disease, may be important for the pathogenesis of MS.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory effect of H2O2 on both the cytotoxic activity and the specific binding of TNF-alpha was studied by using TNF-alpha-sensitized murine L929 cells. When these cells were exposed simultaneously to TNF-alpha and H2O2 (100 to 500 microM), the cytotoxic activity of TNF-alpha was inhibited by up to 66.6%. This inhibition was also effective when the cells were pretreated by H2O2, but not when TNF-alpha alone was preexposed to H2O2. These data suggest that H2O2 altered the cell sensitivity to TNF-alpha, without modifying the activity of the TNF-alpha molecule. Maximum loss of cell sensitivity to TNF-alpha occurred after 30-min preexposure to 500 microM H2O2. Complete restoration of TNF-alpha sensitivity was obtained within 12 h after H2O2 removal. It required protein synthesis as demonstrated by the suppressive effect of actinomycin D. The inhibitory effect of H2O2 was suppressed by catalase, but was unaffected by the scavengers of hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid, suggesting that H2O2 but not one of its metabolites was responsible for this inhibition. H2O2 inhibitory effect did not implicate any change in prostaglandin production or in PKC activity. In contrast, H2O2 effect was associated with an about 50% loss of the density of cell membrane 125I-TNF-alpha receptors (2949 vs 5620 binding sites per cell), without change in their affinity (3.9 vs 3.4 nM). Moreover H2O2 did not affect the rate of degradation of TNF-alpha, and only slightly increased the degree of internalization of 125I-TNF-alpha receptors. These findings indicate that H2O2 can down-regulate the cellular response to TNF-alpha, possibly by reducing the TNF-alpha-binding capacity.\r"

In addition to amino-terminal deletion mutants we described previously, carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were prepared. Functional analysis showed that deletion of only five carboxyl-terminal amino acids already reduced the bioactivity 1000-fold. A panel of mAb to IL-6 was subsequently analyzed by antibody competition experiments and binding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants. On the basis of the competition experiments the six neutralizing mAb were divided in two groups (I and II). The binding pattern with the deletion mutants suggested that the region recognized by the four mAb in group I is composed of residues of amino- and carboxyl-terminus: binding of two mAb was abolished after deletion of amino acid Ala I-Ile26, of the third mAb after deletion of the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids whereas the fourth mAb did not bind to either mutant. Group II mAb retained binding to these mutants. Taken together these data suggest that in the native IL-6 molecule amino acid residues of amino and carboxyl terminus are in close proximity and that together they constitute an active site. Furthermore our data suggest that the part of the molecule recognized by group II antibodies is a second site involved in biologic activity.\r"

Recent cDNA expression studies with lymphoid cells unequivocally demonstrated that the IL-2R beta is an indispensable component for the ligand internalization and the signal transduction via the high affinity IL-2R. Furthermore, these studies confirmed that the IL-2R beta singly expressed on T lymphoid cells represents the intermediate affinity IL-2R. In the present study, however, we show 1) the IL-2R beta expressed on a mouse fibroblast line, NIH-3T3, did not bind IL-2 under the intermediate affinity conditions, 2) nevertheless, the IL-2R beta coexpressed with the IL-2R alpha not only formed the high affinity receptor but also internalized IL-2. By the use of competitive sandwich ELISA to study the IL-2 binding ability of the IL-2R beta molecule itself, we also show that the IL-2R beta present in the detergent-solubilized cell extracts and the secreted IL-2R beta (p37) produced by the truncated cDNA are actually capable of binding IL-2, but with a much reduced affinity compared with the intact IL-2R beta expressed on the lymphoid cells. These findings lead us to postulate a more complex feature of the IL-2R than ever speculated; the IL-2R beta molecule having on its own minimal IL-2 binding ability requires a putative gamma-chain specifically present on lymphoid cells to generate the functional intermediate affinity IL-2R. The gamma-chain, however, seems not to be required as far as the formation of the high affinity IL-2R by the alpha- and beta-chains and the ligand internalization through it are concerned.\r"

In addition to this cytolytic function, increasing evidence suggests that C5b-9 also stimulate a variety of cell functions in vitro. Relatively little is known about the C5b-9 signals responsible for cell activation other than a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ primarily due to Ca2+ influx that have been determined in a cell population. In this report, signal messenger generation in Ehrlich cells by the sublytic terminal complement complexes (TCC), C5b-9, C5b-8, and C5b-7, was further examined, as well as the role of signal messengers in stimulating elimination of TCC from the cell surface. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ were monitored in individual cells after a single dose of C5b-9 by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy that revealed oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ over a period of 10 min. Sublytic C5b-9 substantially increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity at an external Ca2+ concentration of 1.5 mM. C5b-9-mediated PKC activation could be inhibited by 60 to 80% when external Ca2+ was reduced to 0.015 mM. C5b-8, but not C5b-7, activated PKC to a lesser extent. C5b-8 and C5b-7 also stimulated an increase in cAMP. Rapid elimination of TCC known to be stimulated by Ca2+ signal was partially inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, H-7 and to a lesser extent by HA1004, suggesting a role for PKC in the elimination response. TCC elimination was not accelerated by agents that increase cAMP.\r"

We amplified cDNA obtained from HeLa cells by using the polymerase chain reaction and identified two clones, U2 and L13, that encode SmB and SmB', respectively. The nucleotide sequences of these two clones were identical except for the insertion of a 145-bp sequence in U2 that contained an early in frame termination codon and a potential 3' consensus splice site. The predicted amino acid sequences of HeLa SmB and B' proteins were therefore identical except for the COOH terminal 2 (U2) and 11 (L13) amino acids. U2, L13, and four subclones of U2 (F-B, B-R, F-X, and X-B) were ligated to pATH vectors and expressed as trpE fusion proteins. Epitope mapping with 12 human SLE and 12 MRL/lpr mouse anti-SmB/B' sera revealed that antibodies directed against the X-B peptide accounted for most (65.5 +/- 15.4 and 63.2 +/- 25.3%), B-R intermediate levels (51.5 +/- 30.8 and 18 +/- 19.6%), and F-X none of the anti-SmB activity in human and mouse sera, respectively. Ten human and two mouse sera contained antibodies that cross-reacted with epitopes located within the proline-rich, COOH-terminal, 27-residue peptide encoded by B-R and the NH2-proximal F-B peptide. These observations suggest that a) the polymerase chain reaction is a powerful ancillary method to synthesize autoantigens, b) SmB and B' in HeLa cells are derived from alternative splicing of a common RNA transcript, and c) both SLE and MRL anti-SmB/B' sera recognize multiple epitopes (some shared and some unique) on these proteins.\r"

With repetitive exposure to virus, the apparent expressed repertoire is enlarged to include antibody to more and more viral proteins. The subsequent antibody responses appear randomly to different proteins. gB, gC, gE, and 155-kDa proteins vary the most as inducers of antibody responses. Somatic events including variation in precursor cell frequency and immunoregulatory influences are thought to explain the observation that different individual mice respond to different viral proteins and also that each mouse will respond to different proteins upon reexposure to virus at later times.\r"

We found that, even in the absence of these ligands, CRP caused C activation in mildly acidic conditions. The optimum pH for the activation was 6.3, which is within a physiologic range normally found at an inflammatory locus. In this activation, C components C1 and C4 were extensively consumed, C2 and C3 were moderately consumed, and C5 was only slightly consumed. These results indicate that the activation is mediated via the classical pathway, but is restricted to the early stage of the C cascade. As with the plasma contact system, the reaction proceeded in glass tubes but not in polypropylene tubes. However, even in polypropylene tubes, the reaction proceeded after the supplement of kaolin particles to the system. Probably the C activation induced by CRP at a mildly acidic pH required negatively charged surfaces. Analyses of circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra indicate that CRP undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change, thus affecting the reactivity of CRP with the C system.\r"

  ".W": "Lead (Pb) has been shown to enhance B cell differentiation and to induce T cell proliferation in vitro. Our work demonstrates a direct enhancing effect of Pb on IgM production by T cell depleted-, LPS-activated B cells. Pb also caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in the B cell surface density of both products from the I-region of the murine MHC, I-A and I-E, that was comparable to and within the same time frame as other conventional B cell activators. Pb did not alter B cell surface density of MHC class-I molecules, but it did modulate the levels of other relevant activation Ag such as sIgD and Fc epsilon R. The modulation of the B cell phenotype caused by Pb was not due to release of IL-4 from residual T cells or endotoxin contamination of any culture reagents. Hg also increased cell surface MHC class II molecule density; however, neither Ni, Zn, nor Cd modulated Ia, indicating that immunomodulatory metals have different mechanisms of action. These results suggest that the mechanism of Pb immunopotentiation might be due to increased B-Th cell collaboration and that Pb can act as a B cell stimulatory factor. In addition to the obvious environmental implications of these results, determining Pbs mechanism of action on B cells may yield important information relevant to B cell activation in general.\r"

We have cloned bovine herpesvirus type 1 surface glycoproteins gI, gIII, and gIV into the RNA transcription vector pE5LVPO. After translation of the resulting viral mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, each cloned viral protein specifically stimulated bovine T lymphocytes previously primed to BHV-1. In addition, a panel of specifically truncated peptides has allowed the identification of at least two T lymphocyte epitopes encoded within gIII of BHV-1. Our results represent a novel approach for viral Ag synthesis and subsequent detection of lymphocyte recognition. These findings will likely have important implications in the mapping of T lymphocyte epitopes.\r"

The gene consists of five exons of 88, 148, 136, 261, and 257 nucleotides separated by four introns of 1043, 455, 205, and 643 nucleotides. The location of introns with respect to protein coding sequences in the SECT gene is identical to that of the human cathepsin G and murine granzyme B genes. Comparison of SECT gene exonic sequences to murine granzyme B-F cDNA sequences indicates similarities of 75 and 72% for granzymes B and C and 61, 59, and 61% for granzymes D, E, and F, respectively. The 5' flanking sequence of the SECT gene showed similarity only to the 5' flanking sequence of the murine granzyme B gene, indicating that these genes are homologous. Comparison of the SECT gene sequence to the human cathepsin G sequence indicated no similarity in the 5' flanking DNA although the exonic sequences show 64% sequence similarity overall and 45% sequence similarity in the respective 3' untranslated regions. These similarities suggest that the SECT and cathepsin G genes are members of the same family of serine protease genes. Evidence from high and low stringency Southern transfer analysis of human genomic DNA indicates the presence of another gene of at least 85% sequence similarity to the SECT gene.\r"

  ".W": "Our laboratory has recently identified a novel Ag, LGL-1, that is expressed on a major population of mouse NK cells. Two color immunofluorescence analysis has demonstrated that spleen cells consist of two major subsets of NK cells. We have identified an NK-1.1+/LGL-1+ subset that consists of 50% of the total NK cells and an NK-1.1+/LGL-1- subset comprising the remaining 50%. Because numerous reports have identified NK cells as the major cell type mediating lymphokine-activated killing (LAK), the NK-1.1+/LGL-1+ and NK-1.1+/LGL-1- subsets were examined for their contribution toward LAK generation, as defined by their ability to lyse P815 tumor targets. Antibody plus C depletion experiments with the use of anti-LGL-1 indicated that LGL-1+ cells were not found on LAK precursor or effector cells. Two-color cell sorting experiments were also performed to separate freshly isolated NK-1.1+/LGL-1+ spleen cells from the NK-1.1+/LGL-1- subset. It was found that the vast majority of LAK activity (greater than 95%) is derived from the NK-1.1+/LGL-1- cells. Cell sorting of LAK effectors also demonstrated that the NK-1.1+/LGL-1- cells mediated the vast majority of lysis against P815 targets. Similar results were obtained when NK cell subsets were analyzed for their contribution toward ADCC. These findings may prove important in understanding and further elucidating the contribution of NK cells to the LAK phenomenon. Our data also indicates that subsets of NK cells exist that may function differently in response to stimulation by various lymphokines and cytokines.\r"

This readily detects a half-normal dosage in women who are carriers and therefore can be used to diagnose the carrier status of female relatives of 90% of patients with the disease. We have found one family in whom the deletion arose on an allele inherited from the proband's clinically normal maternal grandfather.\r"

Few cyclobutane dimers were excised by 48 h after ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, whereas 50% of the (6-4) photoproducts were removed by 6 h, correlating with previously determined rates of unscheduled DNA synthesis in mouse skin. After this initial rapid phase of (6-4) photoproduct excision, a slower phase was observed between 6 and 48 h. These repair kinetics contrast with those for fibroblast cell cultures derived from mouse tissues irradiated with UV light yielding similar levels of damage. Although the initial rate of (6-4) photoproduct repair in cultured fibroblasts and epidermal cells was similar, the extent of repair in cultured cells was significantly greater, with most of the damage removed by 24 h. The kinetics for (6-4) photoproduct repair in mouse epidermal cells suggest that a significant population, such as terminally differentiated keratinocytes, may have a reduced repair capacity and that the culture process may select for more rapidly proliferating, repair-proficient stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) have been raised against a family of adhesive membrane receptors (R) for extracellular matrix molecules known as integrins. In order to ascertain whether these adhesive proteins are normally expressed in inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) dermal epidermal junction, we studied the reactivity of MoAb recognizing receptors for VLA-1 (R for unknown ligand), VLA-2 (R for collagen), VLA-3 (R for collagen, laminin, fibronectin), VLA-4 (R for unknown ligand), VLA-5 (R for fibronectin), VLA-6 (R for laminin), VNR alpha, and VNR beta (R for vitronectin) on cryostat skin sections from EB patients and normal controls and on cytospins of normal epidermal cell suspensions with indirect immunohistochemical methods. Two cases of junctional EB (EBj) (lethal and non-lethal), three cases of dominant dystrophic EB (EBdd), two cases of recessive dystrophic EB (EBdr), and two normal controls skin sections and cell suspensions entered the study. No significant modification of the distribution of these adhesive receptors was observed in junctional and dystrophic EB skin. Both in normal and EB specimens MoAb against VLA-2, VLA-3, and VNR alpha determinants showed reactivity with the total cytoplasmic membrane of basal keratinocytes and basement membrane zone. Interestingly, anti-VLA-6 MoAb was characterized by an intense linear staining of the dermal-epidermal junction with the same localization on the roof of the blisters in EBj, EBdd, and EBdr as bullous pemphigoid (BP) serum. On the basis of these results we suggest that anti-VLA-6 MoAb could be used instead of BP serum for immunohistochemical detection of the cleavage of blisters in EB.\r"

PAL-M1 also specifically recognized mouse L cells expressing the human transferrin receptor gene. Competition experiments demonstrated that PAL-M1 and OKT9 recognize the same or a spatially close determinant. Immunohistochemical staining of a large series of melanocytic lesions indicates that the transferrin receptor can be considered as a progression antigen in this type of lesion.\r"

Human epidermis was extracted in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and the soluble proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Con-A reactive glycoproteins were identified by incubating gels with iodinated lectin followed by autoradiography. Identical, parallel gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper and filaggrin-related molecules labeled by the specific monoclonal antibody AKH1. We found that the 37-kD Con-A reactive component was resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis into several glycoproteins and that the lectin Con-A does not bind to filaggrin. Under these conditions, the anti-GP37 serum failed to identify any component. However, when applied to human keratinocyte culture extract, AKH1 and the anti-GP37 serum reacted in a similar way. These data show 1) that the 37-kD band is not homogeneous but contains distinct markers of differentiation (filaggrin and Con-A reactive glycoproteins) and 2) that the GP37 antibody's specificity is for the filaggrin precursor.\r"

Therefore, we first searched for glycoproteins which are significantly elevated in human keratinocytes after transformation and immortalization by SV40 virus and which are also found at high levels in keratinocytic cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Out of at least 80 different cell-surface antigenic systems of human tumor cells, only three glycoproteins showed elevated expression in transformed keratinocytes. Among these, a 38-kD glycoprotein (gp 38) was highly increased in all transformed keratinocyte cell lines tested, but was not elevated in transformed fibroblasts. The expression of gp 38 was further characterized in normal epidermis and in its benign and malignant hyperproliferative disorders: gp 38 was generally not expressed in normal epidermis and in benign hyperproliferative disorders. In contrast, strong and homogeneous reactivity was found in solid and fibrosing basal cell carcinomas whereas no or low reactivity was detected in squamous cell carcinomas and in those parts of BCC revealing keratotic differentiation. Interestingly, high expression of gp 38 was also found in primary epithelial germs of fetal skin, secondary germ cells of the telogenic hair follicle and secretory tubules of sweat glands. The immunohistologic data suggest that gp 38 is preferentially expressed by epidermal cells which lack squamous and pilosebaceous differentiation.\r"

The dark reaction of HUT cells with 8-MOP resulted in the disappearance of microvilli, the emergence of plasma-membrane-associated spherical bodies, formation of lamellar fungiform membrane evaginations, and, in approximately 1% of the cells, formation of uropods and cell capping. Except for uropod formation and cell capping, UVA has induced the same plasma-membrane alterations, and was more deleterious to structural cytoplasmic integrity than 8-MOP. Morphologic changes of the plasma membrane in PUVA-exposed cells tended to replicate structural alterations elicited independently during the dark reaction by suprapharmacologic 8-MOP concentrations. Partial retention of microvilli by cells after PUVA was the sole exception. In light of all available evidence we conclude that psoralen during the dark reactions interacts with plasma membrane lipids by as yet undisclosed mechanisms and that in addition to lipids, membrane proteins are also the primary target of the initial interaction of HUT 102 cells with psoralen during PUVA treatment.\r"

Sepsis resulted in negative nitrogen balance and produced increases in the concentrations of blood pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and glutamine, and decreases in those of 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Both plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were increased by 2.2- and 3.2-fold in septic rats, respectively. Portal-drained visceral blood flow increased in septic rats, and was accompanied by a decrease in the rates of utilization of glutamine and production of lactate, glutamate, and ammonia compared with those rates in sham-operated animals. Enterocytes isolated from septic rats showed decreased rates of glucose and glutamine utilization compared with cells isolated from corresponding controls. The maximal activities of hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glutaminase were decreased in intestinal mucosal scrapings of septic rats. It is concluded that a moderate form of sepsis decreases the rates of glucose and glutamine utilization (both in vivo and in vitro) by the epithelial cells of the small intestine. This may be caused by changes in the maximal activities of key enzymes in the pathways of glucose and glutamine metabolism in these cells as a metabolic adaptation to spare glucose and glutamine for use by other tissues.\r"

The assays use monoclonal antibodies produced by immunization with tumor-associated trypsinogen that is isolated from mucinous ovarian cyst fluid. In each assay, one antibody is immobilized onto the walls of polystyrene microtiter strip wells and the other is labeled with an europium(III) chelate. The cross-reaction of each trypsinogen isoenzyme in the assay for the other isoenzyme is less than 1%. The detection limits are 0.1 micrograms/L for trypsinogen-1 and 0.3 micrograms/L for trypsinogen-2. In sera of healthy subjects and patients with extrapancreatic disease the concentration of trypsinogen-1 is higher (median, 21 micrograms/L) than that of trypsinogen-2 (median, 17 micrograms/L), but in acute pancreatitis the ratio is reversed. In acute pancreatitis the concentration of trypsinogen-2 is 50-fold higher than in controls, whereas the difference in trypsinogen-1 concentrations is only 15-fold. The corresponding difference in immunoreactive trypsin measured by a commercially available radioimmunoassay was also only 10-fold.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of immune clearance in normal BALB/c mice were studied by kinetic analysis of the clearance of immunoglobulin-sensitized red blood cells. A rate equation, derived from a model for the clearance of sensitized cells, was used to quantitate four rate constants regulating the individual rate-determining steps in the overall clearance process. A linear relationship was demonstrated between the level of antibody sensitization and constants regulating complement-dependent sequestration (k1), deactivation and release of cells back into the circulation (k2), complement-dependent phagocytosis (k4), and Fc-mediated sequestration and phagocytosis (k3). Clearance rate constants did not change with age in either female or male mice; nor was there a significant difference between the mean values in female versus male mice. The validity of the model was tested by altering serum complement levels to determine whether the predicted changes in complement-dependent rate constants k1, k2, and k4 would occur. Depletion of serum complement by cobra venom factor resulted in a significant decrease in complement-dependent sequestration (k1) and phagocytosis (k4) (p less than 0.001) but had no significant effect on Fc-mediated clearance function (k3). As serum complement was replenished, a greater-than-normal percentage of red blood cells sequestered by the complement clearance pathway underwent phagocytosis (k4) rather than being deactivated and released back into the circulation (k2). Demonstration that the derived rate constants are predictably sensitive to manipulation of a major clearance factor increases the confidence in using this technique and model to study immune clearance in experimental and naturally occurring disease states.\r"

  ".W": "Elongated cylindric and beaded platelet forms are infrequently observed in the circulation, and have been termed \"proplatelets,\" as presumed precursors to discoid platelets. Some 15% of the blood platelets obtained from the guinea pig by cardiac puncture were elongated forms (1/5 beaded and 4/5 cylindric) under conditions of steady state thrombopoiesis, thus providing an opportunity to contrast the structure and deformability of platelets of potential graded maturation. Ultrastructural studies were consistent with graded maturation. Longitudinal bundles of microtubules in cylindric platelets gave way to the appearance of basket-weave arrays in the nodal thickenings of beaded forms, and, finally, to circumferential coils in a portion of the discoid platelets. Individual platelets were aspirated into micropipettes of 0.8 microns internal diameter by application of incremental pressure up to a maximum pressure of 10 cm water. None of the guinea pig platelets fragmented into smaller forms even when aspiration was performed under physiologic environmental conditions. All the guinea pig platelets passed through the micropipette in aspiration studies performed under conditions minimizing platelet activation and adhesion. Elongated platelets aspirated at the very ends of the cells passed through the pipette at lower pressure than discoid forms, whereas elongated platelets aspirated along the length of the cell were more resistant to deformation and cell passage than were discoid platelets. Beaded forms were similar in deformability to cylindric platelets at low aspiration pressure but were more resistant to deformation at high pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90308418\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that pentoxifylline, a drug used in intermittent claudication, causes depolymerization of actin in leukocytes in vitro. In this study we evaluated several parameters in peripheral blood obtained from 17 patients receiving pentoxifylline, before therapy and at 1 and 2 months after initiation of drug therapy. Total blood viscosity decreased at 1 month and was further reduced at 2 months. The plasma viscosity remained unchanged during the course of the therapy (1.770 +/- 0.147, 1.776 +/- 0.162, and 1.772 +/- 0.164 centipoise at 0, 1, and 2 months, respectively; mean +/- SD, n = 14 to 17). No changes were observed in stimulus-induced actin polymerization in granulocytes, concanavalin A-induced capping in granulocytes and lymphocytes, and anti-IgG-induced caps in lymphocytes, before and after therapy. Similarly, there was no difference in the magnitude of depolymerization caused by pentoxifylline when added in vitro. Thus none of the parameters altered by pentoxifylline treatment in vitro have been observed ex vivo in patients receiving this drug. However, the decrease in total blood viscosity along with unaltered plasma viscosity suggests that the rheology of the cellular elements is being affected by the administered drug. In addition to the direct effects on the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton, pentoxifylline may exert indirect effects through its inhibitory action on cytokine production. Subtle changes in a number of parameters in leukocytes, which taken alone fail to show demonstrable changes, might ultimately be responsible for the therapeutic benefit noted with pentoxifylline.\r"

As lysosomal enzymes may play a role in the initiation of pancreatic injury, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol consumption and protein deficiency on pancreatic lysosomal stability. For 3 weeks, male Sprague-Dawley rats were match-fed (in groups of four) isocaloric amounts of one of the following liquid diets: (1) protein-sufficient diet, (2) protein-sufficient diet containing ethanol as 36% of the total energy, (3) protein-deficient diet, and (4) protein-deficient diet containing ethanol as 36% of energy. Pancreatic lysosomal stability was assessed by determining (a) latency, as indicated by the percentage increase in lysosomal enzyme activity in pancreatic homogenate induced by Triton X-100, and (b) by the percentage of lysosomal enzyme remaining in the supernatant after sedimentation of the lysosomal pellet from the pancreatic homogenate. Protein deficiency was associated with a decrease in latency and an increase in supernatant enzyme. Ethanol administration was associated with a decreased latency. Both protein-deficient and ethanol-fed animals exhibited higher pancreatic activities of cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease capable of activating trypsinogen. In addition, protein-deficient animals exhibited higher pancreatic activities of acid phosphatase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and beta-glucuronidase. As lysosomal enzymes are postulated to play a role in the initiation of pancreatitis, these results suggest that ethanol consumption and protein deficiency may at least partly exert their toxic effects on the pancreas by altering pancreatic lysosomal stability and increasing the glandular content of cathepsin B.\r"

  ".U": "90308482\r", 
  ".W": "The need for permanent housing for the chronically mentally ill has received a great deal of attention over the last several years. One response to the problem has been the development of supportive housing, that is, non-facility-based permanent homes with placement based on clients' functional capabilities and preferences. However, little research has focused on assessing the match between clients and environmental requirements. This study begins to identify the social and clinical characteristics of clients that contribute to selection into different types of housing environments. Ninety-one clients were sampled from the supportive housing services of a major provider in two New England states. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability that clients will be placed into apartments vs. other, more restricted settings, based on their clinical and social characteristics. Findings show that the primary determinants of placement were clinical severity, early family history, and adequacy of family support. The less severely ill and better functioning the client, the more likely that he or she was placed in an apartment. This was mitigated, however, by the availability and adequacy of family support. In addition, clients with early family disruptions were also less likely to be placed in apartments. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for providing permanent housing placements for chronically mentally ill persons and for factors in future research to evaluate the success of placement.\r"

The majority (75%) had used cocaine for 4 years or more, and the majority (62%) spent over one thousand dollars a month on cocaine in the 6 months before entry into treatment. Forty-seven percent of the sample were found to be clinically depressed. Phobic disorders were the only other axis I diagnoses found in addition to depression, and all persons who were found to have phobic disorders also were diagnosed as having some form of depressive disorder. The four most common axis II diagnoses were antisocial personality (21%), passive-aggressive (21%), borderline (18%) and self-defeating (18%). Subjects were classified as falling into one of the following three categories of a newly developed \"psychopathology classification\": a) no diagnosed psychopathology except substance abuse or dependency; b) one or more axis II diagnoses, but no axis I diagnoses except for substance abuse or dependency; c) at least one axis I diagnosis in addition to drug disorders whether or not accompanied by an axis II diagnosis. Mean scores on subscales and total score on the SCL-90, as well as total score on the Beck Depression Inventory, were ordered by category of the classification scheme, with those having no diagnosed psychopathology except substance abuse having the lowest score and persons in the third category having the highest score.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The probability that the pattern of response to higher succinylcholine dose resulted from random processes is less than .005. This provides evidence that patients predisposed to emergence agitation are sensitive to seizure-induced metabolic changes in skeletal muscle tissue and that the likelihood of emergence agitation rises with the ratio of skeletal muscle mass to succinylcholine dose. Because ECT-inducted serum lactate elevations are blocked by succinylcholine, emergence agitation might be essentially the same phenomenon as lactate-induced panic.\r"

  ".W": "With the ever-increasing number of intact aneurysms revealed by modern imaging, the options for their management are assuming great importance. While some knowledge has emerged as to their natural history and the results of surgical treatment of those in the anterior circulation, little information has been published concerning unruptured aneurysms arising from the posterior circulation. The authors report their experience since 1971 with 167 patients operated on for 179 unruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysms up to 25 mm in diameter. Overall, 160 aneurysms were treated by direct clip obliteration, while 19 were managed by alternative methods. Fifty-three patients (32%) had solitary aneurysms and the other 114 patients (68%) had multiple aneurysms or an associated arteriovenous malformation, which were commonly treated concurrently. Many of these coexisting vascular anomalies had ruptured in the recent or remote past, adding to the complexity of management and interpretation of specific surgical results related to the intact posterior circulation aneurysm. There were 78 documented postoperative complications including 23 systemic complications, seven postoperative hematomas, six brain injuries from retraction, five cases of aseptic meningitis, three instances of seizures, three wound infections, and three patients with hydrocephalus. Multiple complications occurred in 23 patients. Seventy-one of the patients with these untoward events recovered, without disability, with time or treatment. There were only six poor results and one death in the series, resulting in a 4.2% combined morbidity/mortality rate. However, since two of these poor outcomes and the single death were attributable to a coexisting aneurysm, the actual surgical morbidity related specifically to the posterior circulation aneurysm was only 2.4%. This experience suggests that non-giant, intact vertebrobasilar aneurysms can be obliterated surgically at a very low risk, and this treatment should eliminate the greater lifetime risk related to an unsecured aneurysm.\r"

Recurrent hemorrhages were indicated by the exacerbation of neurological deficits, the appearance of a new neurological deficit, or the onset of acute severe headache confirmed by evidence of recent hemorrhage on either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Persistent neurological deficits correlated with an increased number of recurrent hemorrhages and their location. The median time from initial hemorrhage to the first recurrent hemorrhage was 12 months and the second rebleed generally occurred much earlier, with a median time of 2 months after the first. Eight patients underwent surgery with total excision and favorable results. One patient with a large pontine lesion underwent partial excision and has had a progressing neurological deficit from recurrent hemorrhages. Histopathological review confirmed the excised lesions to be cavernous angiomas. The authors conclude that angiographically occult vascular malformations are not the benign entity they were previously thought to be, and that they are prone to cause recurrent hemorrhages and persistent neurological deficits. Surgery can be effective and relatively safe in removing these lesions even in eloquent areas of the brain, but the necessity of occasional incomplete removal must be recognized in order to avoid creating an unacceptable neurological outcome.\r"

Progressive clinical deterioration was quite common and usually led to a clinical diagnosis of brain-stem intra-axial tumor. Angiography was noncontributory; computerized tomography (CT) was the main diagnostic test. This gave evidence of different pathological characteristics, including masses showing highly increased density, nonhomogeneous hyperdense lesions, and isodense lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. No clear correlation was found, however, between the presumed duration of the clinical picture and the CT characteristics of the lesion. In the last four cases, magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 0.015-tesla resistive system. This examination usually confirmed the presence of a brain-stem mass already shown by previous CT scans. There were, however, no cases in which direct evidence of an intra-axial vascular malformation could be obtained. The patients were all treated surgically with an attempt at total removal of the lesion and thorough inspection of the hematoma cavity and biopsy. Evidence of \"cryptic\" arteriovenous malformation was obtained in six of the nine cases. There were minor transitory complications in three cases. All of the patients were able to resume their previous activity, and none suffered recurrence of the symptoms following the operation. It may be concluded that surgery is the treatment of choice for brain-stem hematoma.\r"

The authors analyze the clinical presentation, surgical results, and histology of eight intrasinus cavernous hemangiomas: six located in the cavernous sinus, one in the petrosal sinus, and one in the torcula. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best radiographic test for surgical planning. Successful tumor removal was achieved in six cases with no mortality and low morbidity. In the remaining two patients, only subtotal resection was achieved because of massive hemorrhage in one and the misdiagnosis of a pituitary adenoma leading to a transsphenoidal approach in the other. For hemangiomas arising within the cavernous sinus, extradural removal of the sphenoid bone facilitated preservation of the neurovascular structures. Since the clinical and histological characteristics of these lesions are distinct from intra-axial cavernous hemangiomas, a more appropriate term may be \"sinus cavernoma\" to indicate that these lesions are primarily intrasinus in origin.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term outcome following carotid endarterectomy for neurological symptoms was analyzed using a retrospective life-table approach in 212 patients who had undergone 243 endarterectomy procedures. The postoperative follow-up period averaged 38.9 +/- 2.1 months (mean +/- standard error of the mean). The endpoints of stroke and death were evaluated in these patients. Patient groups with the preoperative symptoms of amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, and prior recovered stroke were similar in terms of life-table outcome over the follow-up period. Sixty-two percent of symptomatic patients were alive and free of stroke at 5 years. The late risk of stroke (after 30 days postoperatively) averaged 1.7% per year based on a linear approximation to the hazard at each life-table interval (1.3% per year for ipsilateral stroke). The trend of late stroke risk was clearly downward, however, and could be fitted more accurately by an exponential decay function with a half-life of 33 months. Thus, the risk of stroke following carotid endarterectomy for neurological symptoms was highest in the perioperative period, slowly declined with time, and occurred predominantly ipsilateral to the procedure. The definition of a prospective medical control group remains crucial for a critical analysis of treatment modalities following the onset of premonitory neurological symptoms. In the absence of an adequate control group for this series, the calculated perioperative and postoperative stroke risk from this study was compared to data obtained from the literature on stroke risk in medically treated symptomatic patients. This uncontrolled comparison of treatment modalities suggests the combined perioperative and postoperative stroke risk associated with carotid endarterectomy to be modestly improved over medical treatment alone.\r"

  ".W": "The cases of 30 infants with chronic subdural hematoma treated surgically between 1978 and 1987 (after the introduction of computerized tomography) were reviewed. This series was limited to infants presenting with increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, or developmental retardation. Nineteen patients were male and 11 were female, ranging in age from 1 to 14 months (average 6.1 months). The surgical treatment was initiated with percutaneous subdural tapping which was repeated periodically, if indicated, for 2 weeks. If the patients failed to respond to subdural tapping, subdural-peritoneal shunting was installed. The follow-up periods were from 3 months to 9 years 8 months (average 4 years 10 months). Computerized tomography at that time disclosed disappearance or minimal collection of subdural fluid in 28 cases (93%) and a significant collection (greater than 5 mm) in two (7%). Neurological examination revealed that the patients were \"normal\" in 17 cases (57%), \"mildly or moderately disabled\" in nine (30%), and \"severely disabled\" in four (13%). The majority of disabled patients had lesions secondary to infantile acute subdural hematoma, child abuse, or hemorrhagic diathesis. These results indicate that the treatment protocol in the present series is acceptable for the elimination of subdural hematoma. Together, early diagnosis and treatment of the etiological conditions causing the lesion are indispensable for obtaining a satisfactory neurological outcome.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has increased rapidly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is predicted to exceed 1800 cases annually by 1991. To characterize the natural history and response to radiation therapy (RT) of these lesions, the authors have reviewed the clinical histories of 55 AIDS patients with biopsy-proven primary CNS lymphomas. The tumors responded both clinically and radiologically to whole-brain RT consisting of 4000 rad in 267-rad fractions over 3 weeks or an equivalent neuroret dose. The mean duration of survival from the appearance of symptoms consistent with the mass lesion was significantly greater in patients who received RT than in those who did not (42 vs. 134 days, p less than 0.5; median 27 vs. 119 days). Autopsy findings showed that patients who did not receive RT died from tumor progression, whereas those who completed RT died of opportunistic infections. Patients with AIDS who are suspected of having primary CNS lymphoma should therefore immediately undergo biopsy and, if the diagnosis is confirmed, whole-brain RT. With early diagnosis and treatment, these tumors respond to, and patients benefit from, RT. Survival of such patients may in future be prolonged by more effective treatments for systemic opportunistic infections.\r"

A neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used to induce highly reproducible focal cortical lesions in anesthetized rats. Secondary brain damage in this model was characterized by progressive cortical hypoperfusion, edema, and BBB disruption in the vicinity of the hemispheroid lesion occurring acutely after injury. The histopathological evolution was followed for up to 4 days. Neuronal damage in the cortex and the hippocampus (CA-1) was assessed quantitatively, revealing secondary and progressive loss of neuronal tissue within the first 24 hours following injury. Pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 ameliorated the severe hypoperfusion in 12 rats (increasing local cerebral blood flow from a mean +/- standard error of the mean of 40.5% +/- 8.3% to 80.2% +/- 7.8%, p less than 0.01) and reduced edema by 70% in 10 rats (p less than 0.05) acutely after injury. The PAF antagonist also reduced the progression of neuronal damage in the cortex and the CA-1 hippocampal neurons (decrease of neuronal death from 88.0% +/- 3.9% to 49.8% +/- 4.2% at 24 hours in the cortex and from 40.2 +/- 5.0% to 13.2% +/- 2.1% in the hippocampus in 30 rats; p less than 0.05). This study provides evidence to support progressive brain damage following focal brain injury, associated with secondary loss of neuronal cells. In this latter process, PAF antagonists may provide significant therapeutic protection in arresting secondary brain damage following cerebral ischemia and neurological trauma.\r"

One of the peculiar aspects of aneurysm development is a defective proliferative or healing response to such injury. To examine this phenomenon, blood coagulation Factor XIII, which is known to enhance the healing process of wounds in general, was given to rats to induce experimental cerebral aneurysms. The rats were subjected to ligation of one common carotid artery and induction of hypertension, and were fed beta-aminoproprionitrile. Two weeks thereafter, Factor XIII was injected intravenously daily for 5 days (10 U/100 gm body weight/day). Twelve days after the start of Factor XIII injections, the rats were sacrificed and examined under light and electron microscopy. In seven of 12 bifurcations which developed small aneurysms, prominent intimal thickening was observed in the aneurysm lumen. In the most advanced cases, the aneurysm lumen was completely filled with proliferated smooth-muscle cells and collagen. In five of nine bifurcations that showed no aneurysm development, apparent intimal thickening was found at the site where aneurysms might be expected to grow. In the group of rats studied for induction of cerebral aneurysms but not given Factor XIII, none of 11 bifurcations with or without aneurysms showed such intimal thickening. The results indicated that the proliferative response at the sites of aneurysm development was modified by exogenous Factor XIII.\r"

These effects were studied in vitro using four human glioma cell lines and in vivo using glioblastoma multiforme cells transplanted to athymic nude mice. The results showed that verapamil when used alone produced inhibition of tumor growth; however, when verapamil was used in combination with BCNU (in vitro), significant dose-dependent suppression of proliferation occurred in all four cell lines. The in vivo results were far more dramatic. Mice treated with BCNU (25 mg/kg) plus verapamil (50 mg/kg) achieved a 200-fold decrease in tumor growth with a greater than 80% regression in tumor size. Complete cures were achieved in 80% of the mice observed for at least 50 days following the completion of therapy. These findings support the use of verapamil in overcoming drug resistance in malignant brain tumors.\r"

Different sequences and intervals (2 or 3 hours) of IUdR and BUdR administration were evaluated. After denaturation, tumor sections were reacted with Br-3, a monoclonal antibody that identifies only BUdR, and then were stained immunohistochemically by the avidinbiotin complex method. An antibody that recognizes both IUdR and BUdR, IU-4, was applied to the sections and identified by the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase method. Nuclei labeled only with IUdR stained blue, while those labeled with BUdR or with BUdR and IUdR stained brown. The fraction of cells that either left or entered the S-phase during the time between administration of IUdR and BUdR was measured to calculate Ts and Tp, assuming that the labeled cohort completed the DNA synthesis at a constant rate. The Ts was 8.8 hours (coefficient of variation (cv) = 0.05) and the Tp was 64.2 hours (cv = 0.08). The sequence and interval of administration of IUdR and BUdR had a minimal effect on Ts and Tp. In studies of 9L cells in monolayer culture, the Ts was 9.6 hours (cv = 0.08) and the TP was 30.6 hours (cv = 0.06). Double labeling with BUdR and IUdR allows the duration of the S-phase and potential doubling time of individual brain tumors to be estimated in situ from a single biopsy specimen.\r"

Perforating arteries arising from P1 segments were found in all specimens. Rare branches were found to come from the inferior and anterior surfaces of P1 segments. The anatomical patterns of these branches are discussed in the light of previous reports. Preoperative knowledge of some anatomical aspects (the position of the basilar apex, the angle between the right P1 and left P1 segments, and relationships to the dorsum sellae and the mammillary bodies) can help in the selection of a neurosurgical approach and may improve the operative results in the surgical treatment of basilar apex aneurysms.\r"

These findings are evident from serial xenon (Xe)-computerized tomography (CT) measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In this study, 20 minutes of vessel occlusion resulted in brief (less than 1 hour) hyperemia, with no subsequent CT alteration and minimal random neuronal injury. Sixty minutes of occlusion resulted in a more prolonged hyperemia, a low-density area on CT images within 3 hours of reperfusion, and infarction of all cellular elements within the anterior lentiform nucleus. The Xe-CT method provides a sensitive, noninvasive technique for examining sequential alterations of CBF in small regions deep within the brain. This method of recording CBF also permits correlative studies of cerebral infarction, both clinically and experimentally, and allows reasonable inference about the probabilities of neuronal tissue damage with or without reperfusion.\r"

After temporary trapping, a No. 18 angiocatheter is inserted into the cervical internal carotid artery. This catheter is then connected to a wall suction point allowing rapid aneurysm deflation. This technique, accomplished by the surgical assistant, permits the surgeon the freedom to use both hands in dealing quickly with the aneurysm.\r"

Lecithin induced a striking reduction in the plasma levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as an increase in the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Saponins had only a very slight effect in lowering the level of VLDL cholesterol. Apoprotein A-I was unexpectedly present in VLDL, IDL and LDL after feeding rats the H diet and disappeared only after lecithin feeding. The activity of plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was higher when the two lecithin diets were fed than when the other diets were fed. Fecal excretion of neutral sterols was unmodified by the various diets whereas acid steroid excretion increased after lecithin feeding. Saponins, when added with lecithin to the diet, reduced the beneficial effect of lecithin. The results indicate that polyunsaturated lecithin induced a reduction in plasma cholesterol, possibly through an increased formation of HDL particles.\r"

Fatty acid synthesis, as measured by tritium incorporation from 3H2O, was inhibited in the presence of 1 mmol/L propionate with no substrate additions or additions of acetate, butyrate, lactate or oleate. Incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into fatty acids was also inhibited in the presence of propionate. Although propionate markedly depressed [1-14C]acetate incorporation into sterols in hepatocyte preparations, tritium incorporation from 3H2O into sterols was not inhibited, indicating that overall sterol synthesis was not affected. Thus, in vitro, the effect of propionate on lipid metabolism is apparently limited to inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis.\r"

Because cholecystokinin (CCK), a hormonal polypeptide secreted from the upper small intestine after food stimulation, is the most important known humoral stimulus of pancreatic secretion and also because this gut hormone has been shown to promote pancreatic carcinogenesis in the rat, we decided to study the effects of various triglycerides on CCK secretion in this species. Small amounts (2.5 mL) of corn oil, beef tallow, fish oil, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or saline (control) were administered to groups of five fasted rats. Plasma CCK levels were measured using a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay. The maximal CCK increments for corn oil, beef tallow, fish oil and MCT oil were 3.0 +/- 0.5, 2.1 +/- 0.6 and 7.2 +/- 0.4 pmol/L, respectively. All the increments were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than the change found after saline administration (-0.8 +/- 0.3 pmol/L). In another experiment, plasma CCK levels after intragastric administration of MCT oil reached a peak increment of 6.4 +/- 0.4 pmol/L after 240 min and continued to be significantly increased for the entire 480-min study period. It was concluded that all four triglycerides caused a significant CCK release in the rat and that the MCT oil was the most powerful stimulator of CCK secretion among the triglycerides studied.\r"

We also recently developed an improved model of CRF in which animals manifest abnormal tissue amino acid levels, marked anorexia and growth failure. The objective of the current study was to determine the etiology of elevations of sulfur amino acids in animals with chronic renal failure. Chronic renal failure, defined as creatinine clearance less than 30% of control values, was induced in male rats in a two-stage surgical procedure. Four groups were studied over 2, 4 and 6 wk: control (non-operated) control (sham-operated), pair-fed (sham-operated and pair-fed with uremics) and CRF. Animals with CRF were anorexic and growth-retarded. Although plasma sulfur amino acid levels tended to be lower in the uremic animals than in controls, hepatic tissue concentrations were higher. Methionine adenosyltransferase was higher, but cystathione synthase and cystathionase activities were not significantly different in rats with CRF compared to pair-fed controls. We conclude that uremia, not malnutrition, affected sulfur amino acid metabolism and that with CRF, a normal adaptive response to elevated methionine levels was occurring, sufficient to normalize sulfur amino acid pool size. Alternative causes of elevated sulfur amino acids must be sought.\r"

Using a rat model of diet-induced pantothenate deficiency, we hoped in this study to relate pantothenate status, as indicated by serum pantothenate and hepatic coenzyme A, to levels of circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids. Although commercial \"vitamin-free\" casein contained approximately 3 mg total pantothenate per kilogram, marked changes in serum pantothenate and hepatic CoA still occurred during weeks when rats were fed purified diets supplemented with 0 to 1600 mg pantothenate per kilogram of diet. Conditions in different experiments included ad libitum or pair-feeding of 3- or 6-wk-old rats and blood sampling from 3 to 24 h after feeding. Under most conditions of mild pantothenate deficiency in which weight differences between groups were not statistically significant, serum triglyceride and free fatty acid levels were significantly elevated in pantothenate-deficient groups. Mild pantothenate deficiency appears to have observable in vivo effects on triglyceride metabolism before severe deficiency causes significant weight loss.\r"

Some guinea pigs were fed ad libitum a purified diet deficient in vitamin A (VAD group) until biochemical signs of deficiency occurred. A second, control group (VA group) received the same diet as well as 100 IU vitamin A daily by pharyngeal tube. Cochlear potentials were recorded by special computerized equipment using implanted electrodes. Before acoustic stimulation, a baseline value was determined with a test stimulus [90 dBA (A-filter according to usual DIN instructions)] corresponding to that for TTS measurements. Noise-induced changes were determined by calculating the changes in latency and amplitude of the N1-signal of the compound action potential (CAP) at various times (1, 3, 5, 7, 11 min) after termination of acoustic stimulation in comparison with baseline values. Statistical analysis of the CAP data showed that the VAD group had significantly smaller amplitudes and increased latency of the N1-potential after acoustic stimulation and that the VA group did not show a significant change in amplitude or latency. The reduction in N1-amplitude and N1-latency in the VAD group reflects changes in inner ear hair cell activity. We conclude that vitamin A deficiency increases the sensitivity of the inner ear to noise and that this increased sensitivity increases the probability of noise-induced hearing loss.\r"

We have examined the reproducibility of the RDR procedure in a population of Guatemalan adult subjects who would be expected to show a moderate prevalence of hypovitaminosis A. Fifty-one subjects were administered a standard RDR test, and the plasma samples were analyzed for retinol, tocopherol, retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PAL). Thirty-four of the subjects underwent repeat RDR tests 7 d later. Plasma levels in fasted subjects were as follows: retinol, 1.35 +/- 0.30 mumol/L; RBP, 37.8 +/- 7.7 mg/L; PAL, 187.0 +/- 39.0 mg/L; and tocopherol, 16.6 +/- 6.2 mumol/L. RDRs ranged from -35.2% to +63.1%, with a mean of 2.6 +/- 10.4%. Overall, we observed poor within-subject reproducibility of the RDR procedure whether expressed numerically or by diagnostic classification. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies in children, we observed fewer positive RDR tests than would be expected for the population studied. Nevertheless, the mean RDR was inversely proportional to fasting retinol levels, thus confirming the validity of the biological basis of the RDR procedure in humans. Because of high intra-individual variability with this test, investigators should be cautious when using the RDR procedure in serial studies to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic interventions or subject compliance to dietary regimens.\r"

Twelve subjects were administered an RDR test four times over 22 d, including one placebo test in which the oral dose of vitamin A was omitted. Additionally, static measures of retinol, tocopherol, retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PAL) were taken to determine the intra- and inter-individual coefficient of variation for these blood constituents. Intra-individual coefficients of variation were as follows: retinol, 8.8%; RBP, 11.5%; PAL, 7.6%; and alpha-tocopherol, 8.8%. The mean RDR in vitamin A-replete subjects was 1.2% and ranged from approximately -25% to 11%. No differences were observed between placebo and true RDR (i.e., with vitamin A) test responses, and there was no difference among the three true RDRs over a period of 22 d. Consistent with the hypothesis upon which the RDR test is based, nascently absorbed vitamin A evidently entered a storage pool in the liver of vitamin A-replete subjects without immediate release to peripheral sites of utilization. Because the RDR test results were normal in all subjects, the procedure appears to offer high test specificity and does not falsely diagnose hypovitaminosis A. Nevertheless, the magnitude and direction of the RDR within an individual over 22 d were highly variable, and this variability may preclude the use of a single measure of the RDR to grade the relative vitamin A nutriture of an individual subject.\r"

Muscle and liver biopsies were taken initially and at the end of the experiment for determination of Se levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Blood was collected at monthly to bimonthly intervals, and the plasma and erythrocytes were subjected to gel filtration to determine the distribution of Se among proteins of various molecular weights. At the end of the experiment, there was significantly more Se in liver, muscle and hair from the monkeys given SeMet than in tissues from those given selenite, but there were no differences in liver or muscle GPX activity between the two treatment groups. The erythrocyte and plasma Se levels were significantly higher in the monkeys given SeMet than in those receiving selenite, but there were no differences in the GPX levels between these groups. About 68% of erythrocyte Se was associated with GPX in monkeys given selenite whereas only 34% was associated with GPX in those administered SeMet. The correlation coefficient for blood Se level and erythrocyte GPX activity was 0.92 in monkeys given selenite but only 0.37 in those given SeMet. Gel filtration of plasma revealed only one Se peak for plasma from the monkeys given selenite but at least two major Se peaks for plasma from monkeys receiving SeMet. The possible implications of these results for humans are discussed, including the reasons for poor correlations of GPX activity and blood Se levels.\r"

Absorption of Fe from a casein (C), isolated soy protein (ISP), chickpea (CP) or red kidney bean (RKB) test meal was tested in marginally Fe-deficient rats [9.9 +/- 0.2 g Hb/100 mL (mean +/- SD)] using the extrinsic tag technique. Also, the effects of a casein habitual diet or of one of three casein-legume habitual diets fed before and after the test meal were investigated. Weanling male rats were fed the habitual diets containing 23 +/- 4 mg Fe/kg of diet (range 17-28) for 13 d. On d 14, after an overnight fast, rats were fed the test meal (1.5 g + 0.1 microCi 59Fe), and whole-body radioactivity was determined. The same habitual diet was refed for seven additional days, and whole-body radioactivity was determined again. Rats retained more iron from C (86%) than from ISP, CP or RKB test meals (73%, 75% and 67%, respectively) when the respective casein-legume habitual diets were fed before and after the test meals. With the casein habitual diet, there was no difference in retained iron from C, ISP, CP or RKB test meals (86%, 87%, 83% and 82%, respectively). Retention of iron from an RKB test meal was increased from 69.6 to 73% when about 90% of the extractable tannins were removed, but the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, feeding a casein-legume diet but not a casein diet prior to a test meal apparently predisposes the rat to lower iron absorption. However, in these studies, tannins per se did not significantly depress iron bioavailability.\r"

Citrate and fumarate uptake by the brush border membrane vesicles occurred by a common Na(+)-dependent transport mechanism that appears to be specific for tri- and dicarboxylates. The protonated forms of citrate (citrate-(1) and citrate-(2] seem to be much better transported than the trivalent form, as indicated by the strong stimulation of citrate uptake at an extravesicular pH of 5.6 compared to that at pH 7.8. Furthermore, citrate transport across the intestinal brush border membrane appears to be mediated by an electroneutral process.\r"

Response surface analysis predicted maximum responses in performance criteria at 6.3-18.8% corn and 15.8-27.4% fat. Corn inclusion at up to 27-36% of diet resulted in equal or improved performance compared to carbohydrate-free diets of equal fat content. Energy digestibility averaged 84.3%. Protein digestibility averaged 86.7%. Maximum responses in performance criteria were predicted at 42.5-48.7% digestible protein and 4367-4421 kcal/kg digestible energy. In two additional experiments, alligators were either fasted or fed for various numbers of days/week. Carbohydrate-supplementation of high protein diets led to equal or significantly improved performances. Performance was maximized by feeding the alligators 5-6 d/w. Regression of body weight changes against energy and protein intake yielded estimates of daily maintenance requirements of 5.7-8.4 kcal and 0.49-0.89 g protein/kg live body weight. Dietary fat and carbohydrate in the forms and amounts fed to young alligators were well-utilized. Optimal digestible energy:crude protein ratios (8.2-10.9:1 kcal/g protein) were similar to those of other aquatic ectotherms of equal size.\r"

In fact, in comparison to that in fiber-free controls, sterol synthesis was markedly elevated in pectin- and wheat bran-fed animals. In the case of the pectin-treated animals, the higher synthetic rate corresponded to an increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity.\r"

  ".U": "90308578\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperphagia and obesity are often associated, and the origins of the biochemical modifications leading to these syndromes might be in the hypothalamus. Indeed, food intake is regulated by numerous neuropeptides in various hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular (PVN), arcuate (ARC), ventromedian (VMN) and suprachiasmatic (SCH) nuclei. Among these peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) is the most potent inducer of food intake whereas neurotensin (NT) decreases food intake. We measured these two peptides in microdissected hypothalamic nuclei in obese Zucker rats that ate 30% more food than their lean counterparts. Neuropeptide Y and neurotensin levels varied in opposite directions: In the hyperphagic obese Zucker rats, the NPY concentrations were significantly greater than those in the lean normophagic rats in the ARC (+30%), PVN (+60%) and SCH (+94%) nuclei, whereas the NT levels were significantly lower in the ARC (-40%), PVN (-31%) VMN (-66%) and SCH (-47%) nuclei. Both these variations tend to increase food intake. Feeding periodicity might also be modified because large variations of the two peptides have been measured in the supra-chiasmatic nucleus, which is considered the most important regulator of feeding rhythm. The results reinforce the hypothesis that hyperphagia in obesity is associated with a biochemical modification in the central nervous system because the peripheral status of NT and NPY was not modified in the obese rats. Because levels of other hypothalamic peptides, such as opioid peptides and somatostatin, are also slightly modified, it can be concluded that hyperphagia in obesity is associated with a central peptidergic dysregulation. Research on drugs reacting specifically with the receptor of these peptides might have interesting implications for the treatment of hyperphagia and, therefore, of obesity.\r"

Members of the potential heterosexual at-risk group may be identified by demographic variables such as marital status (males and females) and age (females only), but not by socioeconomic class.

  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that HSV-2 infection and associated anogenital ulcerations represent an important risk factor for acquisition of HIV infection. Although this is an appealing biological hypothesis, inferences drawn for homosexual men, as well as other at-risk populations, must be made after careful consideration of methods to control for potential confounding data. This report utilized a nested case-control study in which 49 homosexual HIV seroconverters were compared to 49 homosexual seronegative men matched on the prior level of receptive anal intercourse. No differences were observed for prior HSV-2 infection, since 21/49 (43%) of matched HIV seronegative men were HSV-2 antibody positive and 21/49 (43%) of HIV seroconverters were HSV-2 antibody positive at the visit 6 months before HIV seroconversion (odds ratio of 1.0, 95% confidence limits of 0.3-2.9) Similar findings were also observed for prior HSV-1 infection. Both self-reported symptoms and physical exam findings suggestive of HSV infection were rare during the 12 months prior to seroconversion and not associated with HIV seroconversion. These data do not support HSV-2 as a risk factor for seroconversion to HIV among homosexual men studied. These results should not be generalized to heterosexual transmission of HIV, particularly in Africa, where both an increased prevalence of genital ulcerative diseases and different etiologies have been observed.\r"

  ".U": "90308636\r", 
  ".W": "A seroepidemiological study was carried out to determine the distribution of the human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) in the People's Republic of Angola, where HIV-2 existence was previously unknown and HIV-1 seropositivity was only reported to be present in Luanda and Cabinda. A total of 1,695 serum samples were obtained from healthy persons (control group) and from a group of patients in the provinces of Zaire (13), Lunda-Norte (L.N.) (749), Luanda (556), Huambo (154), Kuando-Kubango (K.-K.) (49), and Namibe (119). All samples were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect immunofluorescence assay using MOLT-T4 cells. Positive samples were confirmed by the Western-blot technique. Sera giving cross reactivity at the level of HIV-1 and HIV-2 large glycoproteins were further tested by radioimmunoprecipitation assay and by reactivity against a peptide corresponding to the dominant epitope of the transmembrane protein. The overall seroprevalance was 14.2%, with significantly higher values in the patient group [19.4% (HIV-1 = 8.8%; HIV-2 = 8.4%; HIV-1 + HIV-2 = 2.2%)] than the control group [9.3% (HIV-1 = 3.3%; HIV-2 = 5.3%; HIV-1 + HIV-2 = 0.7%)]. HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 infection is actually present in Angola in all studied provinces. Higher seroprevalence was seen in the provinces of Zaire, Lunda Norte, and Huambo. People displacements, mainly as a consequence of the war, certainly play an important role in spreading HIV infection from the northern frontier areas of the country to the central and southern regions.\r"

  ".U": "90308637\r", 
  ".W": "Zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) inhibited replication of an immunodeficiency-inducing strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV-FAIDS) in vitro at concentrations of 0.5-0.005 micrograms/ml. A 25-30% additional antiviral effect was achieved in vitro when AZT was combined with human recombinant alpha interferon 2a (IFN alpha). Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) to cats resulted in plasma concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h post-administration with a T1/2 of approximately 1.60 h. Administration of AZT alone or in combination with IFN alpha or interleukin-2 (IL-2) throughout a 6-week treatment period enabled cats to resist challenge with FeLV-FAIDS. In contrast, those cats treated with IFN alpha or IL-2 alone became persistently antigenemic (core protein p27) in parallel with placebo-treated controls. Antigenemia remained undetectable in AZT-treated cats throughout an 80-day period post-inoculation (38 days after treatment was withdrawn). However, latent FeLV-FAIDS in bone marrow was detectable by in vitro culture of progenitor cells in the presence of hydrocortisone. Serial analysis of circulating p27 antigen, neutralizing antibody, and quantification of latent, reactivatable virus indicated that those animals receiving AZT in combination with IFN alpha were most able to resist FeLV-FAIDS challenge. This work provides additional evidence that early presymptomatic treatment employing combination chemoimmunotherapy can be effective in medical intervention of retroviral infection.\r"
