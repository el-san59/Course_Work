Cells expressing the murine protein bind sheep erythrocytes coated with antibody and murine C1-C3d but do not bind Epstein-Barr virus at all. The monospecific antiserum to human CR2 together with goat F(ab')2 anti-rabbit IgG blocks attachment of the C3d-coated erythrocytes to receptor-bearing murine B lymphocytes. To further characterize murine CR2, a lambda gt11 library from the murine late pre-B-cell line 70Z/3 was screened with human CR2 cDNA. A partial cDNA clone of 3.5 kilobases with 79% amino acid sequence identity to human CR2 in the unique intracytoplasmic region and 63% identity to the sixth human CR2 repeat was obtained. Blot hybridization with the murine cDNA clone identified an RNA species of approximately 4.7 kilobases, similar in size to human CR2 mRNA, from a murine B-cell line but not from a murine T-cell line.\r"

Murine CTL cDNA libraries contained in the vector lambda gt11 were screened by using a monospecific antiserum to purified P1. Three recombinant phages were isolated and their cDNA inserts were sequenced. The derived protein sequence contains 554 amino acids and displays, as expected, considerable homology with certain functional domains in the complement components C9, C8 alpha, C8 beta, and C7. The identity of P1 cDNA clones was verified by prokaryotic expression and the reactivities of antisera produced to the expressed proteins. In addition, antisera were produced to two synthetic peptides located in the center and C-terminal portions of P1. All antisera reacted with purified P1. In Northern blot analyses, P1 cDNA probes recognized a 2.9-kilobase mRNA only in CTL. Perforin mRNA was found in all cloned CTL and in all mixed lymphocyte reactions that gave rise to cytotoxic cells. Perforin mRNA was also detected in virus-specific CTL that had been generated in vivo and isolated from liver tissue of mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The cell-specific expression of perforin is consistent with its postulated role in cytolysis.\r"

Lymphoid hyperactivity correlates with the tolerant state: it is present only in animals accepting skin allografts. Tolerized mice that reject the allogeneic skin graft have approximately the same numbers of total and activated lymphocytes as normal mice. The high level of lymphocyte activation in tolerant mice persists for up to 1 year of age, although it declines with age, and is markedly increased by a secondary allograft. The magnitudes of both primary and secondary tolerant responses are significantly higher than the immunological response of a normal mouse rejecting the same type of allograft. These observations contradict concepts of clonal deletion or anergy as the basis of neonatally induced transplantation tolerance and may contribute additional approaches to experimentation and control of transplantation reactions.\r"

Each of these sites can be mimicked by a synthetic oligopeptide of approximately 20 amino acids. Data presented herein indicate that these two sites define the dominant immunogenic epitopes on the hemagglutinin recognized by H-2Kd-restricted CTL. These same sites are not efficiently recognized by hemagglutinin-specific class I MHC-restricted CTL of several unrelated MHC haplotypes. These observations show that even for a large complex glycoprotein molecule like the influenza hemagglutinin, only a limited number of class I CTL recognition sites are generated in the infected cell and that the subset of immunogenic epitopes is dependent on the MHC haplotype of the responding individual. These parameters need to be considered in the design of synthetic and recombinant vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Compartmental models derived from serial electron-microscopic reconstructions of horizontal cell processes entering cone pedicles and rod spherules are used to show that these processes have the morphological and electrical characteristics of dendritic spines. Properties of these spines are incorporated into a distributed model of the horizontal cell network. Expressions relating the magnitude of conductance changes applied at the spine heads to hyperpolarization of cells within the network are derived. Model analyses show that spine properties play a critical role in determining network responses. Specifically, increasing spine stem resistance increases the network input resistance and space constant, hyperpolarizes the resting potential, decreases response to full-field light stimuli, and increases response to small light spots. Increasing spine-stem resistance also decouples potential at the spine head from potential at the cell body. This result suggests that the location of feedback neurotransmitter release sites (e.g., at the spine heads versus the cell body) may have a profound influence on properties of horizontal cell inhibition of cone response. Because of these important functional consequences, structurally realistic models of the horizontal cell network must incorporate spine properties.\r"

The full-length ORF encodes a transactivator, and two transcriptional repressors are expressed from the 3' half of the ORF. Previous analysis has shown that a conserved C-terminal region of 101 amino acids, which is shared by E2 transactivator and repressor proteins, contains the specific DNA binding activity. Further analysis of the E2 transactivator shows that a conserved N-terminal domain of approximately 220 amino acids is crucial for the transcriptional activation function, whereas the variable internal region is not required. The E2 proteins bind to a sequence, ACCGN4CGGT, several copies of which are sufficient to constitute an E2-dependent enhancer. By using a gel retardation assay and proteins derived by in vitro transcription and translation, we were able to show that the E2 polypeptides bind as dimers to a single DNA binding site. The dimeric E2 proteins are stable in the absence of DNA and dimerization is mediated through the DNA binding domain. This may reveal an additional mechanism of repression that could potentially result from the formation of inactive heterodimers between transactivator and repressor species.\r"

To examine the effects of the v-mos oncogene on distinct signal transduction pathways, the 6m2 cell line was used, in which expression of the p85gag-mos oncogene, and consequently transformation, are temperature sensitive. Through the analysis of endogenous metallothionein 1 (Mt-1) gene expression in 6m2 cells, p85gag-mos effects on glucocorticoid, cAMP, and heavy-metal induction were examined. While heavy-metal induction of Mt-1 mRNA was found to be unaffected by p85gag-mos, differential effects were exerted upon glucocorticoid and cAMP induction of Mt-1. Glucocorticoid induction of Mt-1 mRNA in p85gag-mos-transformed 6m2 cells was initiated normally but not maintained to the same extent as in nontransformed 6m2 cells. In contrast, cAMP did not induce Mt-1 mRNA in p85gag-mos-transformed 6m2 cells, although a significant induction was noted in nontransformed 6m2 cells. Thus, an oncoprotein interferes with different steps in each particular signal transduction pathway, ultimately causing abnormalities of inducible gene expression.\r"

The T-cell clone carrying the t(14;14) chromosomal translocation was known to be present for greater than 10 years before the onset of overt leukemia. One molecular rearrangement of the T-cell receptor alpha locus corresponded to a functional variable-joining region (V-J) joining, whereas the other derived from the breakpoint of the t(14;14)(q11;q32) translocation. Chromosomal in situ hybridization of the probe derived from the t(14;14) breakpoint localized the breakpoint region to 14q32.1, apparently the same region that is involved in another ataxia telangiectasia characteristic chromosome translocation, t(7;14)(q35;q32). The 14q32.1 breakpoint is at least 10,000 kilobase pairs (kbp) centromeric to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Sequence analysis of the breakpoint indicates the involvement of a J alpha sequence during the translocation. Comigration of high-molecular weight DNA fragments involved with t(7;14) and t(14;14) translocations suggests the presence of a cluster of breakpoints in the 14q32.1 region, the site of a putative oncogene, TCL1.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize antigens in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene products. The T-cell receptor (TCR) that mediates this MHC-restricted antigen recognition recognizes short peptide fragments rather than the intact antigen. Presentation of peptides to the TCR may thus be a major function of the MHC. An intriguing question emerging from this model is whether peptide presentation also applies to foreign MHC antigens and which of the available MHC molecules can present preferentially the peptides of the foreign MHC molecule. Allo- and xenoreactive CTLs might either recognize native MHC class I molecules or peptides presented by self MHC or by the foreign class I MHC itself. The finding that synthetic peptides corresponding to MHC class I regions are recognized by allo- and xenoreactive CTLs suggests that recognition of foreign MHC by CTLs might involve degraded fragments presented by syngeneic class I molecules. We used MHC transgenic mice as a tool to study these questions. The CTL responses against human (HLA) antigen B27 were analyzed by using HLA-B27 transgenic mice with various H-2 haplotypes. We report here that mouse xeno-MHC-specific (anti-B27) CTLs are perfectly able to kill human and mouse cells expressing the appropriate xenoantigen and that in primary and secondary responses to xeno-MHC, the mouse T-cell repertoire does not use self-H-2 as a restriction element. Absence of H-2 restriction was confirmed by the lack (less than 1/10(6] of H-2-restricted HLA-specific CTL precursors. Therefore, H-2-restricted recognition of xeno-MHC antigens cannot be generalized as part of a classical MHC class I-specific response. These results indicate that xenoreactive CTLs usually recognize intact MHC molecules or MHC peptides preferentially presented by their native MHC molecule. We suggest the latter possibility.\r"

Addition of preparations of purified gp120 from the HIV-1 to human monocytes resulted in the production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and arachidonic acid metabolites from the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Quantification of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-1 revealed an increase in both mediators with 50 ng of gp120 per ml and an increase of 12- and 30- to 40-fold with 200-400 ng of gp120 per ml, respectively. Unlike native gp120, the recombinant nonglycosylated gp120 fragments PB1-RF and PB1-IIIB, as well as one of the core structural proteins of HIV-1, p24, did not increase arachidonic acid metabolism or IL-1 activity. Cytofluorometric analysis revealed that gp120 blocked the binding of OKT4A to the CD4 on monocytes, whereas OKT4 binding was unaffected. Involvement of the CD4 in signal transduction was further demonstrated by the ability of OKT4 and OKT4A monoclonal antibodies to increase monocyte PGE2, IL-1 activity, and nanogram amounts of IL-1 beta.\r"

Analysis of the phenotype and antigen specificity of the infiltrating cells may thus provide insight into the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. T cells were cloned with interleukin 2, a procedure that selects for in vivo-activated cells. All clones had the CD4 CDW29 phenotype. Their antigen specificity was tested by using a panel of candidate joint autoantigens. Four of 17 reacted against autologous blood mononuclear cells. Two clones proliferated in response to collagen type II. After 21 months, another set of clones was derived from synovial tissue of the same joint. One of eight clones tested showed a strong proliferative response against collagen type II. The uncloned synovial T cells of a third operation from another joint also responded to collagen type II. The persistence of collagen type II-specific T cells in active rheumatoid joints over a period of 3 years suggests that collagen type II could be one of the autoantigens involved in perpetuating the inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the possibility of administering therapeutic proteins via the respiratory route, we administered an aerosol of recombinant DNA-produced human alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) to anesthetized sheep and measured levels of the protein in epithelial lining fluid (ELF), lung lymph, blood, and urine. Using a nebulizer that generated aerosol droplets with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.7 micron (55% of droplets were less than 3 micron, a particle size optimal for deposition on the alveolar epithelium), in vitro studies demonstrated that the aerosolized rAAT remained intact and fully functional as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. When aerosolized to sheep, the 45-kDa rAAT molecule diffused across the alveolar epithelium, as evidenced by its presence in lung lymph and in blood. Comparison of ELF, lymph, blood, and urine rAAT levels demonstrated that the process was concentration dependent, with highest levels in ELF and in descending concentrations with approximately 10-fold concentration differences in each consecutive compartment, respectively. Importantly, evaluation with aerosolized 125I-labeled rAAT demonstrated that the rAAT molecules that reached the lung lymph and the systemic circulation remained intact as a 45-kDa protein. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using aerosolization to the pulmonary epithelial surface to administer sizeable proteins of therapeutic interest, thus circumventing the necessity of the traditional parenteral modes of administration of such molecules.\r"

Fifteen subjects (6 men, 9 women) experiencing distal extremity pain received either one placebo pill or a 10-minute treatment of acupuncture-like TENS bilaterally to five acupuncture points on the auricle. Pain levels were measured before treatment and at 0, 10, and 30 minutes posttreatment using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the pain rating index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The VAS showed no statistically significant differences between Experimental Group (n = 8) and Control Group (n = 7) means at pretreatment or posttreatment; however, both groups showed a reduction in VAS means over time. The Experimental and Control Group means on the PRI were significantly different (p less than .05) at all three posttreatment measurements, but not at pretreatment baseline measurement. These results suggest that auricular acupuncture-like TENS could be an alternative for relief of distal extremity pain. Additional clinical studies are necessary to validate the results of this study.\r"

Each woman also participated in a separate study measuring electrical resistance at four auricular acupuncture points before and immediately after treatment. The data were analyzed with a two-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance, which revealed statistical significance over time but not for group or interaction between group and time. Results revealed an average pain relief of at least 50% immediately posttreatment, indicating that acupuncture-like TENS may be useful for dysmenorrheic pain. This study also suggests that auriculotherapy via acupressure may relieve the pain of primary dysmenorrhea.\r"

The tracer concentration was quantitatively evaluated by means of a region-of-interest technique and standardized for both injected dose and body volume. Of 29 patients, 21 had recurrent colorectal malignancy, and eight had a nonmalignant mass. All malignancies were seen on the PET cross sections. Nonmalignant lesions had a low FDG accumulation on images obtained 60 minutes after injection. While the tumor-soft tissue ratio was highest shortly after the intravenous injection of FDG, the tumor-scar ratio was highest 60 minutes after injection. It was possible to differentiate tumor from non-malignant tissue with FDG with the use of standardized concentration values and tumor-soft tissue ratios. Imaging with O-15-labeled water gave no additional information.\r"

All patients had a history of stroke or prolonged reversible ischemic neurologic deficit for more than 4 weeks.

Correlation coefficients for MR imaging (1/T1, 1/T2) and IMP SPECT were below .21. The lesion size was greatest on IMP SPECT images, intermediate on MR images, and least on CT scans. However, MR imaging was superior in detection of pathologic areas (detection rates: MR, 100%; IMP SPECT, 91%; CT, 79%). Relaxation times do not correlate with rCBF.\r"

In most T lymphocytes two signals are required to initiate this process, one supplied by the antigen receptor and the other by accessory cells or agents that activate protein kinase C. Recently, DNA sequences have been identified that act as response elements for one or the other of the two signals, but do not respond to both signals. The fact that these sequences lie within the control regions of the same genes suggests that signals originating from separate cell membrane receptors are integrated at the level of the responsive gene. The view is put forth that these signals initiate a contingent series of gene activations that bring about proliferation and impart immunologic function.\r"

These polypeptide mediators are released by activated macrophages and other cell types in response to injury and are thought to have a role in tissue remodeling and a number of pathologic processes. Analysis of the kinetics of [3H]thymidine incorporation by cultured fibroblasts demonstrated that the response to IL-1 is delayed approximately 8 hours relative to their response to PDGF. IL-1 transiently stimulated expression of the PDGF A-chain gene, with maximum induction after approximately 2 hours. Subsequent synthesis and release of PDGF activity into the medium was detected as early as 4 hours after IL-1 stimulation, and downregulation of the binding site for the PDGF-AA isoform of PDGF followed PDGF-AA secretion. Antibodies to PDGF completely block the mitogenic response to IL-1. Therefore, the mitogenic activity of IL-1 for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells appears to be indirect and mediated by induction of the PDGF A-chain gene.\r"

CGRP elicited vasodilation of the rabbit basilar artery in a dose-dependent fashion when the artery was precontracted by 10(-5) M 5-hydroxytryptamine, whereas almost no relaxation occurred in the rabbit common carotid artery. The relaxation of the basilar artery was 64.03 +/- 1.85% at 3 x 10(-8) M CGRP, with an EC50 of 8.46 +/- 0.08. Two days after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, CGRP-induced relaxation of the rabbit basilar artery was 53.96 +/- 8.08% of the 10(-5) M 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction, not significantly different from that of the basilar artery of the control rabbit. Our findings suggest that CGRP induces potent vasodilation in the rabbit basilar artery and that no impairment of vasodilation occurred after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. We speculate that CGRP may have therapeutic potential in cerebrovascular disease such as vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

A prospective study was performed in 50 consecutive patients with suspected hepatic metastases. Lesion size and detectability were compared on unenhanced CT scans, scans obtained during a bolus injection of contrast material (early bolus phase), and scans obtained during a rapid infusion after the loading bolus. A total of 60 hepatic lesions were evaluated in 26 patients, 19 with histologic confirmation of metastases and seven with strong supportive evidence. The bolus phase allowed detection of 15% more lesions than did examination during the rapid-infusion phase. Lesion size varied, depending on the timing and method of contrast administration; the largest measurements were obtained during bolus injection of contrast material. In addition, bolus administration of contrast material subjectively resulted in the best lesion detection. Because the three techniques of IV contrast enhancement may produce different size measurements, sequential examinations must be tailored appropriately. Scanning during the bolus phase is technically possible with current CT equipment and is recommended as the primary CT screening examination for hepatic metastases.\r"

In three of the 17 patients with clonorchiasis alone, the CT scans were normal. In 14 patients (82%), CT showed diffuse, minimal, or mild dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. None of the patients had marked dilatation. The extrahepatic biliary tree was normal in all 17 patients. All 25 patients with clonorchiasis and hepatobiliary malignancies had diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts on CT, including 18 patients with minimal or mild dilatation and seven patients with marked dilatation. All seven patients with marked dilatation had extrahepatic biliary malignancies. Clonorchis sinensis per se or thickening of the bile duct wall could not be recognized on CT scans. Additional abnormalities evident on CT included pyogenic liver abscesses in two patients and gallstones in five patients. The diagnosis of clonorchiasis can be suspected when CT shows diffuse, uniform, and minimal or mild dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, particularly in the periphery of the liver, without evidence of extrahepatic biliary dilatation.\r"

To investigate this possibility, we performed three in vitro experiments to determine the anticoagulant properties of a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium (iohexol); a low-osmolar, ionic medium (ioxaglate); and a high-osmolar, ionic medium (diatrizoate). In the first experiment, human arterial blood was incubated at room temperature in an angiographic syringe with each of the three media for 60 min, after which the mixture was filtered for clots. In the second experiment, the clotting times of venous blood in heparinized saline or serial dilutions of the three agents were determined. In the third experiment, the partial thromboplastin time of platelet-poor plasma in heparinized saline or serial dilutions of the three agents was measured. No clots were observed in any of the arterial blood samples. Iohexol prolonged the normal 15-min clotting time of venous blood to 160 min, compared with a clotting time of at least 330 min for ioxaglate and diatrizoate. Iohexol prolonged the normal 36-sec partial thromboplastin time of platelet-poor plasma to 40 sec, compared with 50 sec for diatrizoate and 54 sec for ioxaglate. Our data show that iohexol, like ioxaglate and diatrizoate, inhibits clot formation when mixed with blood in a syringe. It prolongs the clotting time to approximately the same degree as 600 U/l of heparinized saline, but to a lesser degree than the other two media. All three media have a minimal effect on the partial thromboplastin time. Our results do not show any risk of clot formation in the usual clinical setting in which there is inadvertent mixing of blood with iohexol, ioxaglate, or diatrizoate in an angiographic syringe.\r"

The flexion teardrop fracture is a specific entity that should not be confused with other types of injury with a teardrop fragment. In a radiographic analysis of 45 patients with flexion teardrop fracture, the most characteristic feature was posterior displacement of the upper column of the divided cervical spine, observed in 78% of the cases. Other radiographic characteristics included backward displacement of the posterior fragment of the involved body, widening of the interlaminar and interspinous spaces, widening of the facet joint with backward displacement of the inferior facet, and kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine at the level of injury. The injury was frequently associated with sagittal-body and laminar fractures and occurred predominantly at the C5 level.\r"

  ".W": "MR imaging of the lumbar spine has become a useful method for the noninvasive evaluation of low back pain. However, bone abnormalities are more difficult to detect than soft-tissue lesions, such as herniated disk. We reviewed 14 MR images of the lumbar spine in adults with spondylolisthesis. These were correlated with CT scans and plain films in all cases. From the CT scans and plain films we found that seven patients had spondylolysis and that seven had other causes for their spondylolisthesis. It was our opinion that the MR images suggested an abnormality of the pars interarticularis in all seven of the cases confirmed to have spondylolysis and in six of the seven patients that did not have spondylolysis. We also studied four cadaver lumbar spine, obtained as blocks of tissue, and scanned in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes with MR and in the sagittal and axial planes with CT. The tissue blocks were then sectioned in the sagittal plane. Spondylolysis is suggested on sagittal MR images when there is an inability to resolve the marrow signal in the pars as uninterrupted from the superior to the inferior facet. This is caused by a dark signal on all pulsing sequences in the pars resulting from marginal sclerosis at the site of the break. If there is also a gap at the site of the break then there will also be an increased signal in the gap resulting from the presence of soft tissue. We found four situations in which the pars can simulate spondylolysis on sagittal MR images: (1) sclerosis of the neck of the pars: (2) partial volume imaging of the degenerative spur of the superior facet slightly lateral to the pars; (3) partial facetectomy; and (4) osteoblastic metastatic replacement of the marrow of the pars.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual appearance of the marrow of the distal femur, characterized by confluent foci of diminished signal intensity replacing the normally expected bright signal of fatty marrow on all pulse sequences, was encountered in 10 asymptomatic patients undergoing routine knee MR imaging. This prompted initial concern about the possibility that this appearance was due to lymphoma or occult myeloproliferative malignancy. All patients were mild to moderately obese, and all but one were women. Peripheral blood analysis was obtained in nine patients and was normal in five. The other four were cigarette smokers with a peripheral leukocytosis. Bone-marrow biopsy of the distal femur in two patients and of the iliac crest in three, performed to exclude malignancy, showed hypercellular but otherwise normal-appearing hematopoietic (red) marrow. The patients have been followed for 4-15 months without evidence of malignancy. We conclude that extensive foci of hematopoietic marrow may be encountered incidentally in patients undergoing MR examination. Careful follow-up to date suggests that this most likely represents a benign process and that patients in whom this appearance is encountered can be managed conservatively.\r"

Absence of the septum pellucidum was never seen as an isolated finding. By using data gathered from the review of the MR scans of patients in this study, we devised a diagnostic algorithm to aid in the classification of these patients. Absence of the septum pellucidum can provide a valuable clue to the diagnosis of malformations of the brain.\r"

The mean age of the patients was 34.6 years, and seizure disorder and headache were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Slightly less than two-thirds of the tumors were histologically pure and almost half were low-grade. Most lesions were cerebral and peripheral in location, and the majority were in the frontal lobes. On CT the tumors were usually hypo- or isodense. Contrast enhancement of tumor occurred in nearly half the cases, and was usually mild and poorly defined. Tumor calcification often occurred, and hemorrhage or cystic formation was not infrequent. Occasionally, calvarial erosion was associated with the tumors because of their peripheral location and slow-growing nature. The lesions were usually sharply demarcated and without edema. MR most frequently revealed hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images and abnormal hyperintensity on T2-weighted scans. In regard to grading or purity of oligodendrogliomas, no significant correlations were found except for a suggestion that higher-grade and mixed tumors tend to enhance more often on CT. The radiographic features of oligodendroglioma are quite characteristic but not pathognomic. A high preoperative suspicion might lead to more appropriate tumor management. MR, although less sensitive in detecting tumor calcification, is superior to CT in defining the tumor extent, which is beneficial for surgical and postsurgical radiotherapy planning.\r"

Although 80% of those successfully dilated were initially free of angina at 23 +/- 11 months of follow-up, one half of these patients had recurrent angina. Although only 48% of the patient cohort had complete relief of angina, 94% had less angina than before dilatation and 86% were able to decrease antianginal medications. Fifteen patients with persistent or recurrent angina had from one to five repeat dilatations. After angioplasty, lung thallium uptake, the extent of abnormal scan segments, and the magnitude of redistribution in dilated lesions were significantly reduced (n = 24 patients). Redistribution defects were seen in 38% of patients on postangioplasty scans. All were associated with subsequent angina. Of various clinical, angiographic, exercise, and thallium-201 scan variables, only the presence of delayed redistribution was an independent predictor of recurrent angina. Restenosis was the most common underlying cause for this exercise-induced perfusion defect. Thus percutaneous coronary angioplasty performed as primary therapy for recurrent angina after bypass surgery is moderately successful in long-term follow-up for the amelioration of symptoms and enhancement of regional myocardial perfusion.\r"

The number of distinct DNA fragments identified for each of these regions varies from 30 to more than 80. An allele frequency distribution was determined for each locus and each ethnic group. The results show significant differences, between ethnic groups, in the pattern of distribution as well as in the relative frequency of the most common alleles of D2S44, D14S1, and D14S13 but only small differences in others (i.e., D17S79 and DXYS14).

In neonates born with and without preceding labor percentages of CD3 cells were lower than those in adults (63% and 60% as opposed to 83% in adults). However, the absolute numbers of CD3 cells were significantly greater in newborn infants delivered without preceding labor (3.287 +/- 1.451 cells per microliter) than in both neonates born after labor (2.660 +/- 800 cells per microliter) and in adults (2.189 +/- 807 cells per microliter). The increase in CD3 cells in infants delivered without preceding labor reflects increased numbers of CD4-positive cells. This increase in the absolute number of T lymphocytes and CD4 (helper) lymphocytes was significant (p less than 0.02). These data indicate that labor-related stress significantly decreases the total number of neonatal T lymphocytes and the CD4 (helper) T-cell subpopulation in cord blood.\r"

Those who received umbilical vein oxytocin had a shorter third stage of labor (4.1 versus 9.4 minutes), less measured blood loss (135 versus 373 ml), and a lower drop in hematocrit (3.9% versus 6.2%).

Monolayer primary cultures of trophoblast cells from pregnant women at term were used. The immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor released in the culture medium eluted from high-performance liquid chromatography with the same retention time as human corticotropin-releasing factor. Norepinephrine and acetylcholine increased immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor release into the culture medium in a dose-related manner. Epinephrine was partially active, whereas dopamine and serotonin did not induce significant changes of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor release from placental cultures. Angiotensin II, interleukin-1, oxytocin, and arginine-vasopressin also increased placental immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor release in a dose-related manner, whereas other peptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, somatostatin, atrial natriuretic factor, interleukin-2) were ineffective. These results showed that several neurotransmitters and peptides stimulate the release of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor from placental cells, suggesting their possible involvement in the physiologic regulation of placental immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor release during pregnancy and parturition.\r"

Overall hospital mortality was 7.7% (time frame 1 = 10.6% versus time frame 2 = 2.0%; p less than 0.01). Overall, functional class III or IV was the strongest predictor of hospital mortality (p less than 0.001). Association of coronary artery bypass graft was the next strongest predictor of hospital mortality (p less than 0.01), and it retained its predictive value in time frame 2. Overall, hospital mortality was higher in patients older than 55 years (10.5% versus 3.5%; p less than 0.05). There were no hospital deaths in patients younger than 55 years in time frame 2. Type of valvular lesion was not a predictor of hospital mortality. Hospital mortality in patients receiving cardioplegia was 2%. Cardioplegia use has lessened the effect of age and functional class as predictors of hospital mortality after primary aortic valve replacement. Earlier operation in time frame 2 played a substantial role in the overall improvement of early results.\r"

The risk of hepatitis transmission is substantially reduced by using cryoprecipitate plasma instead of fibrinogen from pooled donors.

  ".W": "Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with cyclosporin A (CsA) has been successful, but the adverse effects of the drug have limited its use. We investigated the capacity of another immunosuppressive agent, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], to augment the effects of CsA on in vitro T cell functions. Exposure of CD4+ cells from RA patients or from normal subjects to either molecule alone resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of phytohemagglutinin stimulation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production that was more pronounced in cells from RA patients than in cells from normal subjects. Moreover, the action of CsA and 1,25(OH)2D3 on RA patient T cell functions in vitro was synergistic. Thus, in the presence of the vitamin D3 metabolite, only one-hundredth the concentration of CsA was required to produce the same effect on IL-2 production as that produced by CsA alone. IL-2 receptor expression was also reduced by the addition of both drugs. In contrast, IL-1 production by RA monocytes was not affected by CsA and 1,25(OH)2D3, either together or alone, and addition of IL-1 did not restore the ability of CD4+ cells from RA patients to secrete IL-2. Exogenous IL-2 reversed a large part of the inhibitory effect induced by both CsA and 1,25(OH)2D3, indicating that the immunosuppressive properties of these agents are mediated by the inhibition of IL-2 secretion. This synergy between 2 molecules that are biochemically very different suggests the existence of one or several sites of interaction that take place during the early stages of T cell activation.\r"

Forty-eight (98%) of the Thais and all (100%) of the white Australians were positive for ANA, with the majority (100% and 97%, respectively) showing a diffuse speckled pattern of nuclear fluorescence. The distribution of the patterns was different in the 2 races; 35 (71%) of the Thais and 17 (25%) of the Australians showed staining of the nucleolus, and 1 (2%) of the Thais and 35 (51%) of the Australians showed staining of the centromeres. The frequency of precipitating antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens was also strikingly different: 86% in Thais and 26% in Australians (P less than 0.001). Precipitating antibodies to Scl-70 (topoisomerase I), the predominant extractable nuclear antigen in patients with scleroderma, were detected in 37 (76%) of the Thais and 18 (26%) of the Australians, and these were shown by Western blotting to react with the Scl-70 (topoisomerase I)-associated polypeptides. Differences in the frequencies of the ANA specificities in the 2 races were consistent with differences in the clinical manifestations of scleroderma; all of the Thai patients, in contrast to 15% of the Australian patients, had diffuse scleroderma with widespread skin involvement. This suggest that environmental or genetic factors may influence the expression of scleroderma.\r"

Roentgenographic findings, in addition to features typical of OA, included soft tissue densities (tophi), with or without calcification, large intraarticular erosions, characteristic nonmarginal cortical erosions, and periarticular osteolysis. We conclude that urate crystals mediate episodes of acute inflammation in certain patients with nodal OA.

These episodes were inducible in 19 of 39 preparations. The arrhythmia started several seconds after cessation of vagal stimulation strong enough to cause sinus arrest, without electrical stimulation of the myocardium. The arrhythmia consisted of two to 20 beats (6 +/- 4, mean +/- SD, n = 42) with a cycle length of 100-500 msec. Recording from 32 sites with spatial resolution of 1-2 mm showed that the arrhythmia was due to intra-atrial circus movement. The estimated perimeter of the reentrant circuit ranged from 6 to 20 mm. In circuits of the minimal size, the average conduction velocity along the circuit was as low as 2-3 cm/sec. Paroxysms of the tachycardia were always preceded by vagally induced nonuniform depression of conduction, with some areas of atria being completely blocked. As the vagal influence decreased, the blocked areas recovered in an inhomogeneous manner, their unblocking being significantly (p less than 0.05) delayed after inhibition of tissue cholinesterase by proserine. The reentrant tachycardia was initiated when a sinus impulse arrived during certain phase of the unblocking. Unlike the well-known mechanism of reentrant excitation, which is based on inhomogeneous refractoriness and critically timed extrabeat(s), the circus movement in our model depended on vagally induced conduction block and could be launched by a single sinus impulse.\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances in lipid metabolism may play an important role in the onset of irreversible myocardial damage. To investigate the effect of ischemia and reperfusion on lipid homeostasis and to delineate its possible consequences for myocardial damage, Krebs-Henseleit-perfused, working rat hearts were subjected to various periods of no-flow ischemia (10 to 90 minutes) with or without 30 minutes of reperfusion. During ischemia, the rise in nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) was preceded by the accumulation of substantial amounts of glycerol, indicating the presence of an active triacylglycerol-NEFA cycle. The subsequent rise in NEFAs (from 0.25 to 1.64 mumol/g dry residue wt after 90 minutes [means]) coincided with the reduction of ATP to values lower than 10 mumol/g dry wt and the rise of AMP, a potent inhibitor of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase, to values exceeding 2 mumol/g dry wt, making the latter compound a good candidate to hamper the turnover of endogenous lipids during prolonged ischemia. Reperfusion resulted in an additional rise in NEFAs (up to 4.1 mumol/g dry residue wt after 60 minutes of ischemia). Neither ischemia nor reperfusion resulted in significant decreases in the tissue content of triacylglycerols and the various phospholipids. During reperfusion recovery of stroke volume was still adequate at tissue NEFA levels thought to be incompatible with normal mitochondrial function. A positive correlation (r = 0.81) was found between NEFA content of reperfused hearts and cumulative release of lactate dehydrogenase during reperfusion. Accordingly it is concluded that 1) reperfusion results in additional changes in myocardial lipid homeostasis, 2) the accumulating NEFAs are compartmentalized, possibly at the cellular level, and 3) the accumulation of NEFAs is a sensitive marker for myocardial cell damage.\r"

The lesions are most numerous in the metaphyses of long bones but may appear on diaphyses of long bones and on flat bones and vertebrae. The transmission is autosomal dominant. Sarcomatous transformation is uncommon and probably occurs in fewer than 1% of patients. The more common indications for surgical excision of lesions are pain, growth disturbance, compromised joint motion, cosmesis, and secondary impingement of tendon, nerve, or vessel. Excision of the lesions is effective in relieving pain, improving cosmesis and joint motion, and removing secondary impingement of tendon, nerve, or vessel, and may retard or prevent progressive disturbance of osseous growth. Wrist and ankle deformities are often associated with relative shortening and bowing of the ulna and fibula, respectively; tilt and tapering of the distal radial and tibial epiphyses; and distal radioulnar and tibio-fibular diastasis. These deformities can be effectively treated by ulnar and fibular lengthening combined with hemiphyseal stapling of the distal radius and tibia. Progressive genu valgum is well corrected by placement of staples over the medial side of the physis of the distal femur or proximal tibia or both.\r"

  ".U": "89107031\r", 
  ".W": "An understanding of the regulation of CRF secretion in rats is currently incomplete, in part due to the lack of sensitive in vitro models available for studying this neuropeptide. In particular, the effects of catecholamines on CRF secretion, and the receptor subtypes mediating these actions have long been the subject of much debate. A cultured cell model has been adapted for studying secretory responses of hypothalamic cells of 1-week-old rats. Between 7-16 days in monolayer culture the cells secreted detectable levels of immunoreactive CRF, and this release was paralleled by the appearance of punctate bead-like regions of immunoreactivity along fine cellular processes. CRF secretion was increased up to 4-fold by norepinephrine (EC50, approximately 0.5 microM). The increase in CRF secretion produced by norepinephrine was blocked by the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-antagonist prazosin. Moreover, the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol significantly elevated CRF secretion, whereas the alpha-agonist phenylephrine was without effect, except at high concentrations. Addition of phenylephrine, however, potentiated the effect of isoproterenol, but this response was still significantly less than that produced by norepinephrine. Forskolin (EC50, approximately 0.7 microM) and the active phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (EC50, approximately 40 nM) also increased CRF secretion by 3- to 4-fold. Inactive phorbol derivatives had no effect on CRF release from these cultures. The results indicate that cultured neonatal rat hypothalamic cells are a powerful model for the study of CRF release in vitro, and that norepinephrine acts directly at the isolated cell level to stimulate secretion of this peptide, primarily by activating beta-adrenoceptors. The results also suggest that at least two functional second messenger systems (adenylate cyclase and protein kinase-C) are involved in CRF secretion and are already functional in the neonatal hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "In fetal uterine cells in culture, epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased progesterone receptor concentrations more than 2-fold. Two other growth factors, transforming growth factor-alpha and fibroblast growth factor, were not able to cause the same increase. This response to EGF was dose dependent; a half-maximal effect was obtained at 10(-10) M. The antiestrogens tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were able to antagonize the stimulatory effect of EGF on progesterone receptor concentrations, but they did not affect its mitogenic effect. The inhibitory effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen depended on concentration; half-maximal inhibition was observed between 0.5-1 X 10(-9) M. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen could completely inhibit the progesterone receptor increase due to EGF even when added to cells already exposed to the growth factor for 6 days. EGF seems to be acting as an estrogen in increasing progesterone receptors in fetal uterine cells, and antiestrogens are potent antagonists of this response, indicating that growth factors may also be involved in some protein-inducing effects of estrogens. Since estrogen receptor levels were at the limits of detectability under all of the experimental conditions studied, nonestrogen receptor-mediated pathways may be involved. These observations show the potential importance of other factors acting in combination with estrogens in the modulation of progesterone receptor levels.\r"

  ".W": "Osteocalcin (OC) is one of the abundant non-collagenous bone matrix proteins produced exclusively by osteoblasts, and its serum level is used as an indicator of bone metabolism in patients. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is abundant in bones and platelets, promotes wound healing in vivo, and is a potent stimulator of the production of extracellular matrix proteins in fibroblasts and osteoblasts. The effects of TGF beta on OC gene expression were examined in rat osteoblast-like cells, ROS17/2.8. TGF beta 1 decreased OC levels in the culture media 2- to 3-fold. TGF beta 1 also decreased the level of osteocalcin mRNA about 3-fold in a dose-dependent manner. TGF beta 2 and TGF beta 1,2 a heterodimeric form, showed similar effects on OC mRNA levels as TGF beta 1. The suppression of the OC message level was detectable at 24 h and lasted for up to 72 h. This effect on OC mRNA was blocked by cycloheximide. The stability of OC mRNA was not changed by TGF beta 1. On the other hand, the rate of OC gene transcription was reduced 4- to 5-fold, as estimated by in vitro nuclear transcription (run-on) assay. TGF beta 1 blocked the increase in the OC mRNA level induced by PTH or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results indicate that TGF beta inhibits osteocalcin gene expression at least in part through transcriptional control.\r"

These disorders are likely to be secondary to central dysregulation(s), which could lie somewhere within or in relationship with the hypothalamus. In view of the reported effects of CRF in stimulating sympathetic nerve-mediated mechanisms, while inhibiting vagus nerve-mediated ones, ovine CRF (oCRF) was administered for 7 days into the cerebral ventricles of fa/fa rats at a dose (5 micrograms/day) that did not affect the pituitary-adrenal axis. oCRF treatment stopped the excessive weight gain of the obese animals; oCRF-treated animals gained only 1 g over 6 days, while the vehicle-treated ones gained 29 g (P = 0.044). The oCRF effect was unrelated to changes in food intake, as the two groups were pair-fed. oCRF-treated obese rats were characterized by a decrease in basal hyperinsulinemia, increases in brown adipose tissue weight and activity, and decreases in hepatic glycogen content and epididymal fat pad weight. It is suggested that intracerebroventricular oCRF administration to obese fa/fa rats prevents the 10-15% increase in body weight observed in vehicle-infused obese rats within 1 week by modulating the impaired autonomic nervous control of different target tissues. This does not occur in lean rats.\r"

  ".W": "The local production and action of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like substance within the seminiferous tubule was investigated as a potential mediator of cell-cell interactions. Peritubular (myoid) and Sertoli cells were isolated and cultured under serum-free conditions. Proteins secreted by Sertoli and peritubular cells were found to contain a component that bound to the EGF receptor in a RRA. Separation of secreted proteins by reverse phase chromatography fractionated a protein that contained EGF bioactivity in its activity to stimulate growth of an EGF-dependent cell line. Biochemical properties examined for both Sertoli and peritubular cell EGF activities were similar with each other, but distinct from murine EGF. Northern blot analysis with an EGF cDNA probe did not detect EGF gene expression in peritubular, Sertoli, or germ cells. The possible production of an EGF-like substance such as transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) was investigated with a molecular probe to human TGF alpha. Both peritubular and Sertoli cells contained a 4.5-kilobase mRNA species that hybridized in a Northern blot analysis with a human TGF alpha cRNA probe. An immunoblot with a TGF alpha antisera confirmed the production of TGF alpha by the detection of a protein in both Sertoli and peritubular cell secreted proteins. TGF alpha gene expression was not detected in freshly isolated germ cells. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of high affinity EGF receptors on peritubular cells and the absence of such receptors on Sertoli or germ cells. TGF alpha was found to stimulate peritubular cell proliferation, but had no effect on Sertoli cell growth. The effects of hormones and TGF alpha on Sertoli cell function and differentiation were assayed through an examination of transferrin production by Sertoli cells. TGF alpha had no direct effect on transferrin production or the ability of hormones to influence Sertoli cells. However, the presence of peritubular cells in coculture with Sertoli cells allowed TGF alpha to stimulate transferrin production. TGF alpha was also found to have relatively rapid effects on peritubular cell migration and the promotion of colony formation in culture. Cocultures of peritubular and Sertoli cells also responded to TGF alpha by the formation of large clusters of cells. Observations demonstrate the local production of TGF alpha by Sertoli and peritubular cells, and action of TGF alpha on peritubular cells and, potentially, Sertoli cells. The local production and action of TGF alpha may have a critical role as a paracrine/autocrine factor involved in the maintenance of testicular function.\r"

These two effects of IL-1 showed similar but inverse dose-response relationships: Significant effects were observed at concentrations higher than 50 pg/ml, and the maximal effective concentration was 5 ng/ml, which reduced progesterone secretion by 53.5 +/- 2.1%. In contrast, IL-1 neither inhibited progesterone secretion nor did it influence cell number in cultures of fully mature granulosa cells harvested from the largest (8-11 mm) follicles. The growth-promoting effect of IL-1 on granulosa cells was further examined in the low density cultures, which revealed that IL-1 significantly stimulated proliferation of the less mature granulosa cells at concentrations higher than 50 pg/ml, and that at a maximal stimulatory concentration (25 ng/ml) it increased cell number to 206 +/- 11% of control. Although IL-1 increased cell number and reduced progesterone secretion of fully mature granulosa cells after 5 days in low density cultures, it seemed that the proliferating population were not the cells with luteinized morphology and positive 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase staining. The proliferating population of cells appeared to have less mature morphology and were negative for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase staining.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the nature of unexplained chronic serum aspartate aminotransferase elevations of a mild to moderate degree in asymptomatic patients, we performed systematic clinical, biochemical and histologic examinations in 47 individuals who had been screened for virus-, alcohol- or drug-related disease. Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels ranged from 3- to 8-fold normal (mean: 156 +/- 7 units per liter) for at least 6 months (mean: 30 +/- 6 months). Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were also increased but to a lesser degree in most patients. Thirty-four patients (72%) had histologic features of chronic active hepatitis, including 16 with cirrhosis. Ten patients (21%) had steatohepatitis and three (6%) had miscellaneous disorders. Patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis could not be distinguished from counterparts without cirrhosis by individual clinical or laboratory findings. Antinuclear or smooth muscle antibodies were detected in 18 of the patients with chronic active hepatitis (53%). All patients with steatohepatitis were women, and they had laboratory changes at presentation, including seropositivity for antinuclear antibodies, that overlapped with those of patients with chronic active hepatitis. We conclude that asymptomatic patients with unexplained chronic aspartate aminotransferase elevations of a mild to moderate degree frequently have chronic active hepatitis and that many have cirrhosis. Immunoserologic findings compatible with autoimmune hepatitis are commonly present. Steatohepatitis is the most frequent alternative diagnosis, especially in women, and it is not excluded by the presence of antinuclear antibodies. Differentiation of the disorders is possible only by histologic examination.\r"

The effect of the intervention, which was implemented by a cardiac rehabilitation nurse specialist, was assessed by a knowledge test and a state anxiety inventory. Data were collected without knowledge of the participants' group assignment. As hypothesized, data analysis with independent t tests revealed a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) difference between the knowledge level of the experimental and the control group in the areas of coronary artery disease, diet, medications, physical activity restrictions, exercise, and rest. A statistically significant difference between the state anxiety level of the experimental and the control group was also evident, as was a statistically significant inverse relationship between participants' knowledge and anxiety levels.

Researchers have proposed that activation of the complement (C) system may play a role in the development of the pulmonary inflammation associated with ARDS. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether complement activation occurs to a greater extent in patients with ARDS than in patients without ARDS, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the acute inflammation seen in ARDS. In this study, we assessed plasma complement activation by measuring complement activation by-products: C1rC1s-C1 inhibitor complex and C3b-P complex, generated subsequent to activation of the classical and alternative pathways, respectively, and also the terminal complement complex, formed after activation of either the classical or alternative complement pathway. Multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that these three complement activation complexes could distinguish patients with ARDS from those without ARDS (p less than 0.04). Furthermore, these three complexes provided a more sensitive discriminator of ARDS than did plasma levels of C3a desarginine (p greater than 0.30), C5a desarginine (p greater than 0.41) and total hemolytic complement activity (CH50) (p greater than 0.72). We conclude that a temporal association exists between the complement activation and the development of ARDS. Therefore, we suggest that complement activation by-products be included in the armamentarium for ARDS.\r"

Thus we tested the capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to form osteoclasts in long-term culture. We have reported previously that mononuclear cells from feline, baboon, and human marrow form osteoclast-like cells in long term cultures. Further, the formation of these cells is increased in response to bone resorption stimulatory agents such as PTH, interleukin 1, and transforming growth factor alpha. We now report that these cells show characteristic cytoplasmic contraction with calcitonin and form resorption lacunae when cultured on sperm whale dentine. Thus, these bone marrow-derived multinucleated cells fulfill the functional criteria for osteoclasts. Although cultured peripheral blood monocytes can be induced to form multinucleated cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, these cells did not show similar responses to the osteotropic factors as multinucleated cells formed in the bone marrow cultures multinucleated cells. These results indicate that osteoclasts or cells closely related to osteoclasts form in long-term human bone marrow cultures. In contrast, few mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood appear capable of forming osteoclasts under the culture conditions used in these experiments.\r"

This cytokine promotes T and B lymphocyte growth and differentiation, and acute phase protein synthesis. We therefore examined IL-6 production by human synoviocytes and its presence in synovial fluids. In vitro, synoviocytes spontaneously released IL-6, which was increased by IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Synoviocyte-derived IL-6 activity was able to induce hybridoma-plasmacytoma proliferation, and immunoglobulin and acute-phase protein synthesis. The synovial fluids from patients with diverse arthropathies contained IL-6 activity, but higher levels were present in inflammatory arthropathies than in osteoarthritis. These results demonstrate that synoviocytes are a potent source of IL-6, which can contribute to important manifestations of inflammatory arthropathies.\r"

  ".W": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is believed to play a critical role in wound healing and in morphogenesis. Factors controlling the production of HA by fibroblasts in normal and pathological states are not completely understood. In this report we have observed that natural human interleukin (IL-1)1 beta and human recombinant (hrIL)-1 alpha and beta are potent stimulators of HA production by fibroblasts in vitro. Hyaluronic acid is the major species of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) stimulated by IL-1 in fibroblasts. PGE2 does not appear to be involved directly in this IL-1 effect on fibroblasts, but stimulation of HA production by IL-1 is dependent on protein synthesis. The synthetic human IL-1 beta peptide 163-171 (Val-Gln-Gly-Glu-Glu-Ser-Asn-Asp-Lys), which has been previously shown to stimulate thymocyte proliferation but not fibroblast PGE2 production, is also able to stimulate fibroblast HA production. The synthesis and secretion of IL-1 by mononuclear phagocytes at sites of inflammation and immune reactions in vivo could potentially serve as a signal for fibroblasts to synthesize HA, which in turn could serve to facilitate and modulate reparative and immune processes by virtue of its ability to alter cell-cell, cell matrix, and cell-membrane receptor interactions.\r"

  ".W": "Articular cartilage destruction and loss of function in arthritic diseases involves proteolytic degradation of the connective tissue matrix. We have investigated the degradation of cartilage collagen by developing immunochemical methods that permit the identification and analysis of type II collagen degradation in situ. Previously, a technique to specifically identify type II collagen degradation in situ in articular cartilage did not exist. These methods utilize a polyclonal antiserum (R181) that specifically reacts with unwound alpha-chains and CNBr-derived peptides, alpha 1(II)CB11 and alpha 1(II)CB8, of human and bovine type II collagens. The experimental approach is based on the fact that when fibrillar collagens are cleaved the helical collagen molecule unwinds, exposing hidden epitopes. Here we demonstrate the use of R181 in studying type II collagen degradation in bovine articular cartilage that has been cultured with or without IL-1 and in human normal, rheumatoid, and osteoarthritic articular cartilages. Compared to cartilages either freshly isolated or cultured without IL-1, bovine cartilage cultured with IL-1 for 3-5 d showed an increase in both pericellular and intercellular immunohistochemical staining. Extracts of these cartilages contained type II collagen alpha chains that were increased in amount after culture with IL-1 for 11 d. In addition, culture with IL-1 resulted in the appearance of alpha chain fragments of lower molecular weight. All human arthritic tissues examined showed areas of pronounced pericellular and territorial staining for collagen degradation as compared with non-diseased tissues, indicating that chondrocytes are responsible in part for this degradation as compared with non-diseased tissues. In most cases rheumatoid cartilage was stained most intensely at the articular surface and in the deep and mid-zones, whereas osteoarthritic cartilage usually stained more in the superficial and mid-zones, but less intensely. Distinct patterns of sites of collagen degradation reflect differences in collagen destruction in these diseases, suggesting possible different sources of chondrocyte activation. These experiments demonstrate the application of immunological methods to detect collagen degradation and demonstrate an increase of collagen degradation in human arthritides and in IL-1-treated viable bovine cartilage.\r"

Recently, an autoimmune form of angioedema has been described that is associated with functional deficiency of C1-Inh and an autoantibody that impedes C1-Inh function. In this report we describe the isolation of C1-Inh from the monocytes and plasma of a patient with autoimmune angioedema and demonstrate that the patient's monocytes secrete structurally and functionally normal C1-Inh, but show that this protein circulates in the patient's plasma in an inactive, structurally altered form. Furthermore, using analytic gel electrophoresis techniques it is demonstrated that the patient's autoantibody facilitates cleavage of normal C1-Inh, by its target proteases, to the same species of C1-Inh that is found circulating in the patient's plasma. This autoantibody facilitated cleavage of normal C1-Inh is apparently a consequence of destabilization of protease/inhibitor complexes. These findings contribute to our understanding of protease/C1-Inh interactions and document important observations on pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmune disease.\r"

Recombinant IL-1 alpha (rIL-1) is a comitogen for glomerular mesangial cells. Using this model we explored potential transmembrane signals by which IL-1 stimulates cellular responses. Certain mitogens hydrolyze inositol phospholipids by phospholipase C to generate 1,2-diacylglycerol, a cofactor for protein kinase C, and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, which mobilizes intracellular calcium. rIL-1 induced a peak increase in [3H]1,2-diacylglycerol formation at 1 min. Production of 1,2-diacylglycerol often parallels the generation of phosphatidic acid; however, rIL-1 stimulated [32P]phosphatidate formation only after 60 min. rIL-1 did not change the inositol phosphate or cytosolic free calcium concentrations, demonstrating that rIL-1 does not activate an inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C. [3H]Phosphorylethanolamine, but not [3H]phosphorylserine or [3H]phosphorylcholine, was maximally elevated at 1 min in mesangial cells incubated with rIL-1. Radioactivity incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine but not phosphatidylcholine was also decreased in IL-1-stimulated mesangial cells compared with control at 1 min. These data suggest that rIL-1 activates a phospholipase C predominantly linked to phosphatidylethanolamine. In contrast to other mitogens, rIL-1 did not alter intracellular pH. Both 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, a homologue of 1,2-diacylglycerol, and phosphatidate but not phosphatidylcholine in the presence of 0.5% fetal bovine serum stimulated mesangial cell proliferation. rIL-1-induced cellular activation may be mediated, at least in part, by phospholipid-derived second messengers generated through novel pathways.\r"

Metabolic consequences of ischemia can be demonstrated with positron emission tomography. Therefore, 10 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an echocardiographic septum to posterior wall thickness ratio of 1.8 +/- 0.4 cm (range 1.3 to 2.5) were studied with the use of nitrogen (N)-13 ammonia, carbon (C)-11 palmitate and fluoro (F)-18 2-deoxyglucose as tracers of myocardial blood flow, fatty acid metabolism and exogenous glucose utilization. The results of positron emission tomography in 9 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were compared with those in 10 normal volunteers. In the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy group, observed myocardial activity of N-13 ammonia and C-11 palmitate in the septum was similar to that in the lateral wall. Septum to lateral wall tissue activity ratios averaged 1.04 +/- 0.15 for N-13 ammonia and 1.04 +/- 0.18 for C-11 palmitate, and were similar to those in the normal volunteers (0.98 +/- 0.07 and 0.98 +/- 0.03, respectively; p = NS). Myocardial clearance half-time and residual fraction of C-11 palmitate did not differ significantly between the septum and lateral wall. However, F-18 2-deoxyglucose uptake was significantly lower in the septum than in the lateral wall (15,768 +/- 4,314 versus 19,818 +/- 5,234 counts/pixel; p less than 0.003). The mean septum to lateral wall activity ratio of 0.83 +/- 0.21 was less than that observed in normal volunteers (0.92 +/- 0.07; p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patient developed retroperitoneal Burkitt's lymphoma with probable metastasis to the brain. His short life was characterized by recurrent staphylococcal skin, middle ear, and lung infections associated with extremely elevated serum concentrations of IgE. There was also an associated disturbance of bone metabolism with osteoporosis and pathologic fractures and absence of parathormone, findings that have been observed in other patients with hyper-IgE syndrome and other forms of T cell immunodeficiency. At the age of 5 years, inadequate B cell responses to immunization with antigens derived from diphtheria, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b organisms and with the OX174 bacteriophage were demonstrated in the patient. In his terminal state his in vitro lymphocyte analysis demonstrated findings of anergy.

From this library, we have isolated and sequenced 14 clones that hybridize with beta-chain constant region probes, eight of which contain V gene segments. Two of these eight contain a V gene segment whose sequence is 85% identical to mouse V beta 14, which has been estimated to be present in mouse thymocyte cDNA at a frequency of only 1.2%. Of the remaining six, four appear to be homologues of known mouse V beta sequences, and average 88% identity with their mouse counterparts. Two additional rat V regions have no homologue yet identified in the mouse, showing only 64 and 73% identity with the most closely related mouse sequences; at least one of these is present and polymorphic in the mouse genome, and may be located near one end of the V beta deletion known in the SWR strain. The availability and pattern of V beta gene segment expression in rat thymus appears, therefore, to differ significantly from the mouse. Two cDNA clones represent germline transcripts which show a J/C splice (one of which is defective) but no D/J rearrangement; two different J segments are used, indicating the presence of promoter activity 5' to these two J segments. In addition, by using V beta-specific probes derived from our cDNA clones, we have analyzed the distribution of V beta alleles among 10 inbred strains of rat. We find that rat V beta gene segments occur predominantly in single member subfamilies, and present evidence for the existence of three TCR V beta haplotypes defined by RFLP.\r"

Spherical cell aggregates (spheroids) grown from human glioma cell lines H-2 and U-251 were labeled with 51Cr and then incubated for up to 24 h with LAK cells. After the incubation, most spheroids were still macroscopically identifiable, and the measured reduction of volume did not correlate to the extent of damage. LAK cells infiltrated into spheroid tissue slowly as a frontier which explains why the specific 51Cr release was clearly slower from spheroids than corresponding single cell suspensions. The infiltrated area was at 1 to 2 h very thin but by 8 to 12 h consisted already of several cell layers. Most H-2 spheroids became totally infiltrated by 16 to 24 h whereas in U-251 spheroids the infiltration usually remained peripheral. In accordance with the different extent of infiltration, H-2 spheroids were clearly more sensitive to LAK cells than U-251 spheroids: at E/T ratio 10:1 the mean specific 51Cr release by 24 h was 63 and 36%, respectively. A single exposure to LAK cells released 51Cr from H-2 spheroids approximately 12 h but over 24 h from U-251 spheroids. The spheroid model can be used to study the infiltrative capacity and cytotoxicity of LAK cells against three-dimensional tumor tissue, and the method may help to find an optimal mode of local LAK cell therapy, i.e., proper combination of lymphokines and LAK cells, and proper timing of their administration.\r"

The anti-Id-3A4 is part of a tumor-associated idiotypic network which is involved in the regulation of the immunity against the DBA/2 L1210/GZL tumor. These 3A4-Id-specific T cell clones are phenotypically Th cells and recognize Id in the context of MHC class II molecules under MHC restriction. Moreover, the recognition of Id by these T cell clones is chloroquine sensitive, suggesting that they recognize processed Id. However, the 3A4-Id-specific T cell clones respond only to 3A4 and not to TAA. Because these clones do not recognize TAA, their biologic role in antitumor immunity could be as regulatory T cells involved in the idiotypic network regulation.\r"

The present study demonstrates that T cell activation does occur after in vivo administration of anti-CD3 mAb to mice, evidenced by increased IL-2R expression on T cells, CSF secretion, and extra-medullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. These effects required multivalent cross-linking of the mAb, since F(ab')2 fragments failed to induce them. However, the F(ab')2 fragments did induce modulation of CD3/TCR from the surface of T cells, demonstrating that TCR modulation is not sufficient to induce activation. In addition, interaction of the TCR with either intact or F(ab')2 fragments of the mAb led to increased expression of CD8 in vivo, suggesting that the F(ab')2 fragments of anti-CD3 mAb might be capable of inducing a T cell to undergo some, but not all, of the changes involved in reaching a fully activated state. Further study of the activating effects of anti-CD3 mAb might increase the understanding of the mechanisms of in vivo T cell activation and might also be exploited clinically to stimulate T cell function in immunocompromised states and to enhance hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic disorders.\r"

In addition, animals made orally tolerant to MBP also have diminished proliferative and antibody responses to MBP, but not to other Ag. Nonetheless, the mechanism of oral tolerance to MBP in the EAE model remains undefined. In the present study, we report that T cells isolated from the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of MBP orally tolerized animals can adoptively transfer protection against EAE. Furthermore, these T cells are of the CD8+ subclass. In addition, CD8+ T cells from MBP orally tolerized animals also suppress in vitro proliferative responses and antibody responses to MBP in an Ag-specific fashion. These results demonstrate that active cellular mechanisms are initiated after oral administration of an autoantigen that can down-regulate an experimental autoimmune disease and provide the basis for the isolation and characterization of the cells mediating both in vivo and in vitro suppression.\r"

Irradiated enriched bone marrow progenitor cells induced the proliferation of cocultured peripheral blood T cells, with maximal proliferation at 8 days and stimulator:proliferator ratios of 1/1. This autologous proliferative T lymphocyte response was completely abrogated by the inclusion of anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD2, or anti LFA-3 antibodies into the coculture, and partially inhibited by anti-CD4. Repetitive stimulation with autologous progenitors at days 14 and 28 expanded and further enriched the autoreactive T cells, which proliferated specifically in the presence of autologous progenitors. When incubated for 12 h with bone marrow before short term hematopoietic culture, these autoreactive T cells inhibited hematopoiesis 60 to 100%. These data indicate that a subset of T lymphocytes recognize proliferating hematopoietic progenitors and regulate the growth and differentiation of normal bone marrow cells.\r"

Unstimulated cells exposed to infectious virus for up to 48 h did not synthesize any detectable unintegrated HIV DNA duplex forms or integrated genomic provirus. However, activation of these cells with either PHA or OKT3 (anti-CD3) mAb before viral exposure resulted in the generation of unintegrated HIV DNA after 6 h and integrated copies after 24 h. Cell-to-cell fusion studies showed significantly attenuated fusion between freshly isolated resting T cells and T cells constitutively expressing high levels of HIV envelope glycoprotein (HXB/gpt) compared with T cells first stimulated with either PHA or OKT3 mAb. The baseline fusion observed with resting T cells is believed to be a consequence of allogeneic stimulation by the HXB/gpt cell line. These results provide evidence that HIV entry and HIV envelope-dependent cell-to-cell fusion require T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The derivation of subline of CTLL cells that grow in IL-4/B cell stimulatory factor-1 is described. These cells, designated CT.4R cells, were obtained by extended culture of the CTLL line CT.EV in IL-4. CT.4R cells are highly responsive to both IL-4 and IL-2. Mutagenesis of CT.4R cells with ethylmethane sulfonate and selection for lack of expression of the p55 chain of the IL-2R was carried out and a clone was selected that was hyporesponsive to IL-2 but retained full sensitivity to IL-4. These cells, designated CT.4S cells, develop a very meager response to IL-2 at concentrations of 100 U/ml or less although that display vigorous responses to higher IL-2 concentrations. CT.4S cells give measurable responses to 3-10 U/ml (approximately 15-50 pg/ml) of IL-4. CT.4R and CT.4S cells fail to respond to IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, CSF-1 or IFN-gamma. Thus, CT.4S cells can be used as a sensitive and specific bioassay for IL-4. ID CT.4R cells can be grown in either IL-4 or IL-2. When grown in IL-4, CT.4R cells express small amounts of the p55 chain of the IL-2R but rapidly upregulate their level of expression of p55 when IL-2 is added and rapidly diminish p55 expression when IL-2 is removed. Thus, although IL-2 and IL-4 both stimulate vigorous growth responses by CT.4R cells, they differ in their capacity to induce the expression of the p55 chain implying that their mechanisms of T cell stimulation are not identical.\r"

We show that the cell line, designated A4, proliferated in response to IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. The A4 cells also proliferated in response to their own B cell derived growth factor (B. BCGF), suggesting autocrine-mediated growth. The ability of IL-4 to induce proliferation of the A4 cell line was dependent on the level of autocrine growth. At low cell density, IL-4 induced marked dose-dependent proliferation. However, as A4 cell density increased, the ability of IL-4 to induce proliferation was diminished. The possibility that IL-4 may be mediating the autocrine growth of A4 cells was ruled out, because A4 cell-derived BCGF failed to induce CD23/low affinity receptors for the Fc region of IgE on activated tonsillar B cells and anti-IL-4 antibody did not block B. BCGF activity. We found that IL-4 stimulation of A4 cells and activated tonsillar B cells is associated with enhanced production of B. BCGF. These data indicate that human IL-4 has the capacity to promote proliferation of the B cell line A4, and that the ability of IL-4 to function as BCGF is associated with enhanced autocrine growth of activated B cells.\r"

We investigated this immunoregulatory mechanism and find that catalase, an H2O2 inhibitor, also enhances IL-2 production by MNC. The addition of PAO, but only in the presence of either endogenous or exogenous spermidine (a polyamine), decreases IL-2 production; this effect is catalase inhibitable. Pre-incubation with spermidine, but not any of three diamines tested, suppresses PHA-stimulated IL-2 production and this effect requires monocytes. Three PAO inhibitors have an enhancing effect on IL-2 production which is again monocyte dependent. These results suggest that: 1) H2O2 produced by PHA-activated PBMC down-regulates IL-2 production; 2) products of the interaction between PAO and spermidine inhibit IL-2 production and H2O2 is essential but apparently not sufficient to mediate this effect; 3) human PBMC contain PAO activity. This polyamine-PAO-dependent inhibitory mechanism might constitute a feedback loop that limits human T cell proliferation and, consequently, also the immune responses mediated by these cells.\r"

  ".W": "In various mammalian cell types the stimulation of the plasma membrane amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange and the resulting increase of intracellular pH (pHi) play a key role in the initiation of cell proliferation. In the present work we have investigated whether Na+/H+ exchange is involved in normal human B cell proliferation and whether it is also operating in malignant B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) lymphocytes. Our results show that: 1) normal human B cells contain an operating Na+/H+ exchanger, as inferred by their ability to recover pHi after acid-loading in a HCO3- -free medium and by evidences that LPS and phorbol ester PMA elicit a pHi rise inhibitable by either 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) or a Na+-free medium; 2) LPS-induced proliferation of normal human B cells is strongly inhibited when the amiloride analog EIPA (5 microM) is present in the culture medium (after 72 h the proportion of B cells incorporation bromodeoxyuridine falls from 13.9 +/- 3.9% to 2.8 +/- 1.1%); 3) EIPA does not affect BdR incorporation when B cells proliferation is induced by the co-mitogenic activity of IL-4 and low m.w. B cell growth factor (BCGF); 4) B-CLL cells, which proliferate in response to IL-4/BCGF but not to LPS, fail to increase pHi above their pHi resting levels when challenged with LPS or PMA and pHi recovery after acid-loading is highly impaired. These results lead to conclude that Na+/H+ exchange operation is necessary for LPS-(but not for IL-4/BCGF)-induced proliferation of human normal B lymphocytes and that Na+/H+ exchange activation is impaired in malignant B-CLL lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "As assessed by immunoprecipitation analyses, expression of the epitope recognized by the rat mAb B23.1 is approximately sevenfold greater on the surface of mouse IL-3-dependent bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC) than on serosal mast cells (SMC) obtained directly from the peritoneal cavity. Immunoprecipitation of B23.1 antibody-binding molecules from Na[125I] surface-labeled BMMC and SMC followed by sizing on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions demonstrated that the epitope is located on molecules of 49,000 and 47,500 Mr, respectively. An additional immunoprecipitated molecule of 42,000 Mr was detected from BMMC intrinsically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, and pulse-chase analyses revealed that this species was a biosynthetic precursor of the 49,000 Mr cell surface form of the Ag. Treatment of the immunoprecipitated 42,000 and 49,000 Mr forms with endoglycosidase F reduced the Mr of both to 37,000, as did intrinsic radiolabeling of BMMC in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that both the 42,000 Mr precursor form and the 49,000 Mr cell surface molecule (gp49) contained N-linked carbohydrate. Activation of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled BMMC by sensitization with mouse monoclonal IgE anti-TNP and challenge with TNP-BSA or by exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 elicited the rapid phosphorylation of gp49 but not of its precursor forms, as did treatment of the cells with PMA. Elution of phosphorylated and immunoprecipitated gp49 from SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by partial acid hydrolysis of the protein and phosphoamino acid analysis by high voltage thin-layer electrophoresis on cellulose plates indicated that serine, but not threonine or tyrosine, was phosphorylated upon stimulation of BMMC with IgE/Ag, calcium ionophore, or PMA. Cholera toxin did not elicit phosphorylation of gp49. These data suggest that gp49, a plasma membrane glycoprotein preferentially expressed by mouse BMMC, may be either directly or indirectly phosphorylated via protein kinase C during mast cell activation-secretion.\r"

The selective breeding induced two major consequences in low responder mice: (1) a reduction of the number of L3T4+ cells and (2) a restriction of T cell expansion upon PHA stimulation, predominantly affecting the Lyt-2+ subset, and associated with an abridgment of IL-2 production. In vivo PHA stimulation induced anti-Listeria protection in high responder mice, but was much less effective in low responder mice. Flow cytometer analysis revealed that T cell proliferation was also reduced in low responder mice during the course of Listeria infection, implying both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ subsets. This defect did not apparently influence the kinetics of bacterial elimination in host tissues, which was similar in both lines during primary Listeria infection. In contrast, the expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity to Listeria antigens and the level of immunologic memory were significantly reduced in low responder mice. In vivo selective T cell depletion by anti-L3T4 or anti-Lyt-2 mAb allowed us to demonstrate the predominant role of Lyt-2+ cells in protection and that of L3T4+ cells in the expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity.\r"

Likewise, patients with nonreducing anteriorly displaced discs of the temporomandibular joint did not respond well to physical therapy. Pain management was evaluated separately and showed subjective improvement in 82% of patients with mild to moderate disc dysfunction and pain. Only 29% of patients with late-opening clicking or locked joints experienced pain relief. When patients were classified according to occurrence of the clicking phenomenon, interesting trends relating to duration of symptoms were found. Twenty-two patients who did not respond favorably to physical therapy underwent surgical procedures. Findings in these patients offer suggestions about why nonsurgical therapy is not successful in certain cases.\r"

The effects of these polypeptides were compared with the actions of human transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). In the longitudinal muscle preparation, wherein the contractile actions of agonists were abolished by 1 microM indomethacin, the order of potency was: hEGF-URO = mEGF-URO greater than TGF-alpha greater than hEGF-URO1-47 greater than or equal to mEGF-URO1-47. In this longitudinal muscle preparation, reproducible contractions could be obtained by rinsing the preparation free of agonist and by maintaining intermittent dose intervals of 1 hr or more. In contrast, in the circular muscle preparation, all agonists elicited a contractile effect that was present in the presence of 1 microM indomethacin. In this indomethacin-treated preparation, when an intermittent dosing regimen was used, repeated exposure to either human or murine EGF-URO caused a persistent desensitization. However, in the indomethacin-treated circular muscle preparation, repeated exposure to TGF-alpha and hEGF-URO1-47 during an intermittent dosing schedule caused only a low degree of persistent desensitization. In the indomethacin-treated circular muscle preparation, the order of potency for the contractile effect was: TGF-alpha = hEGF-URO1-47 greater than or equal to hEGF-URO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89110825\r", 
  ".W": "Moclobemide belongs to a new generation of short-acting, reversible, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. In vitro (rat brain homogenates) moclobemide inhibits MAO-A selectively with lower potency than many of the reference MAO inhibitors. However, when measured ex vivo in the rat, the potency of moclobemide is similar to that of reference compounds. In vivo the drug induces a dose-dependent, short-lasting (8-16 hr) and preferential inhibition of MAO-A in the brain and both MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition in extracerebral organs (liver, small intestine and kidney). In the extracerebral tissues of the rat moclobemide induces marked peripheral MAO-B inhibition due to rapid and extensive biotransformation of its morpholine ring. The active molecular species is probably the metabolite Ro 16-6491. The moderate MAO-B inhibition measured after moclobemide intake in human platelets indicates that only minor amounts of Ro 16-6491 are formed in humans. Virtually all metabolites of moclobemide so far identified have been tested in vitro and ex vivo in the rat and proved to be either equipotent or, mostly, less effective than moclobemide as MAO-A inhibitors. In liver homogenates of moclobemide-treated rats MAO-A activity recovers during dialysis or simple incubation at 37 degrees C, suggesting a biodegradation of moclobemide and/or the moclobemide-derived active metabolite(s) by MAO itself or a slow dissociation of the active inhibitory species from the enzyme. Similar to other MAO-A inhibitors, moclobemide induces an increase in the rat brain levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine and dopamine and a concomitant decrease of their deaminated metabolites. These effects are of short duration (8-16 hr) and parallel the time course of MAO-A inhibition. Moclobemide administered subchronically down-regulates beta adrenoceptors as shown by binding experiments with brain cortical membranes using dihydroalprenolol as ligand. In vitro MAO inhibition by moclobemide is specific in that the compound does not affect other amine oxidases or monoamine uptake mechanisms; furthermore, it does not interact with various neurotransmitter or drug receptor sites. In conclusion, a large body of preclinical evidence characterizes moclobemide as a short-acting and reversible MAO-inhibitor. The neurochemical profile of moclobemide indicates clearly that this nonhydrazine nonhepatotoxic MAO-A inhibitor represents a novel and safe drug for treatment of affective disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The neuronal uptake and metabolism of 2-fluorodopamine (2F-dopamine), 6-fluorodopamine (6F-dopamine) and tritium-labeled dopamine were compared in heart, submaxillary gland and spleen of rats to assess the utility of 18F-labeled 2F- or 6F-dopamine for positron emission tomographic imaging of sympathetically innervated tissues. Tritiated dopamine with and without 2F- or 6F-dopamine, or tritiated 2F-dopamine alone, were injected i.v. into rats that were or were not pretreated with desipramine to block catecholamine neuronal uptake or with reserpine to block vesicular translocation of catecholamines. Tissue and plasma samples were obtained at intervals up to 1 hr after injections. At 1 hr after injection of tritiated dopamine, tritium-labeled norepinephrine, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dihydroxyphenylglucol accounted for less than 2% of the tritium in plasma but up to 92% of that in tissues; tritiated norepinephrine accounted for 70% or more of the tritium in tissues. In contrast, at 1 hr after injection of tritiated 2F-dopamine, tritiated 2F-norepinephrine accounted for 30 to 46% of the tritium in tissues. Desipramine and reserpine pretreatment blocked the tissue accumulation of tritiated and fluorinated dopamine as well as their dihydroxy-metabolites, indicating that accumulation of exogenous norepinephrine and dopamine analogs was within sympathetic storage vesicles. Relative to the doses of dopamine precursors, less 2F- and 6F-norepinephrine accumulated in tissues than tritiated norepinephrine, due largely to inefficient beta-hydroxylation of fluorinated dopamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide's (CGRP) role(s) was examined in the transmural nerve stimulation (TNS)-induced vasodilator response of the large cerebral arteries of the cat in vitro. Numerous CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were demonstrated to be present in the adventitial layer of the middle cerebral, anterior communicating and basilar arteries of the cat. An electron microscopic study revealed that immunoreactive material was contained in not only nerve axons but also in the button-like structures, i.e., varicosities, which were located close to smooth muscle cells. Exogenously applied CGRP induced a dose-dependent vasodilator response which was independent of the presence of endothelial cells and of nerve components. Nerve stimulation elicited transient hyperpolarization, i.e., inhibitory junction potential, which was of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic origin. Likewise, CGRP produced hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells. After incubation of the tissue with capsaicin in vitro, the intensity of the CGRP-like immunoreactivity diminished greatly. The TNS-induced vasodilator response and inhibitory junction potentials were also attenuated after the incubation with capsaicin. These results suggest that CGRP is involved in the TNS-induced vasodilator response of the large cerebral arteries of the cat.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately two thirds of patients with head and neck cancer have been shown to have peripheral mononuclear cells that exhibit a lowered blastogenic response to the T-cell mitogens, concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin. To investigate the possible mechanisms of this phenomenon, we measured the amount of activated T-cell lymphokine interleukin-2 present in the supernatant of concanavalin A- or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells taken from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. Concentrations were found that were similar to those of healthy subjects. The rate of interleukin-2 consumption and the degree of interleukin-2 receptor expression also were similar for patients and controls. In the course of these experiments, it was noted that differences in blastogenic response between patients and controls were abolished when, 24 hours after the beginning of either concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin stimulation, the culture supernatant was removed and replaced by fresh medium, containing recombinant interleukin-2 to further sustain cell growth. This suggests that the lower blastogenic response found in patients with head and neck cancer is not due to global immune unresponsiveness, but instead, is caused by selective cell dysfunction(s), which may include the production of a suppressor factor following concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "89111792\r", 
  ".W": "The projection site in the central nervous system of individual end-organ branches of regenerated vestibular nerves was documented in bullfrogs. The eighth cranial nerve was surgically sectioned in 12 bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) and allowed to regenerate. Horseradish peroxidase was used to label the primary vestibular afferent fibers from the whole nerve (one frog) and the whole anterior branch (two frogs), and the individual receptor end-organ branches to the anterior semicircular canal (three frogs), the horizontal semicircular canal (three frogs), and the sacculus (three frogs). A sufficient number of fibers from the individual receptors were labeled in nine specimens to allow a description of their central projection pattern. The overall pattern of central projections of the regenerated nerves was similar to the pattern of normal nerves. In the eighth nerve root proper and in the area proximal to the vestibular nuclei, fibers from the anterior semicircular canal were ventral, fibers from the sacculus and posterior branch were dorsal, and fibers from the horizontal semicircular canal were in an intermediate position. In ventral, superior, and descending vestibular nuclei, a projection pattern was also identifiable in some specimens. The fibers of the anterior semicircular canal projected ventral to the fibers of the horizontal semicircular canal, with fibers from the posterior branch more dorsal. The saccular fibers projected to the dorsal aspect of the ventral nucleus and the ventral aspect of the dorsal nucleus. For the most part, projections in the regenerated specimens, as verified histologically, were comparable to individual end-organ projections previously identified in normal frogs. The only major discrepancy between the findings from the regenerated specimens and those from normal frogs was in the position of the vestibular tract and the innervation to the medial nucleus. The regenerated vestibular tract was shifted laterally in the brain stem. Regenerated thick and thin fibers were intermixed in the tract and projected to the medial nucleus. Normally, the thin fibers are lateral to the thick fibers in the tract. Therefore, the regenerated afferent fibers of the vestibular nerve selectively reinnervated the vestibular nuclei, and the fibers to the individual end-organs selectively reinnervated particular parts of the nuclei. In addition, the thick and thin regenerated fibers preserved the type of bouton endings normally found. The regenerated thick fibers had rare boutons en passant and a great number of collaterals, while the thin fibers had numerous boutons en passant and only a few collaterals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The hospital and autopsy records of infants admitted to a nursery during the last 18 months that benzyl alcohol was in use (218 patients) were reviewed and compared with those of infants admitted in the first 18 months after benzyl alcohol was withdrawn (232 patients). The volume of flush solution administered to each patient was estimated. Exposure to benzyl alcohol was significantly associated with the development of kernicterus (P less than .005), and intraventricular hemorrhage (P less than .000,000,5). Kernicterus did not develop in any patient after benzyl alcohol was withdrawn. Many patients with kernicterus or intraventricular hemorrhages received small daily volumes of fluid containing benzyl alcohol. Withdrawal of benzyl alcohol from clinical use had no demonstrable effect on mortality. Medications intended for neonatal use should not contain benzyl alcohol. Our data indicate that patients not exposed to benzyl alcohol have a greatly reduced risk of kernicterus. If this finding is confirmed by other investigators, present indications for exchange transfusions in preterm infants with moderate elevations of serum bilirubin should be reconsidered.\r"

An increase in the prevalence of ventricular septal defects was detected in 1,494 infants with congenital cardiovascular malformations between 1981 and 1984. The prevalence of congenital cardiovascular malformations increased from 3.6 to 4.5 per 1,000 live births (P less than .025) and the prevalence of ventricular septal defect increased from 1.0 to 1.6 per 1,000 live births (P less than .001). The increase in ventricular septal defects accounted for the total increase in congenital cardiovascular malformations. The prevalence of isolated ventricular septal defect increased from 0.67 to 1.17 per 1,000 live births (P less than .001). The prevalence of ventricular septal defect with associated coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, and pulmonic stenosis did not change. The prevalence of ventricular septal defect diagnosed by catheterization, surgery, and autopsy did not change; however, defects diagnosed by echocardiography increased from 0.30 to 0.70 per 1,000 live births (P less than .001). It is concluded that the reported increase in prevalence of ventricular septal defect is due to improved detection of small, isolated ventricular septal defects and that there is no evidence of an \"epidemic.\"\r"

In general, subjects demonstrated a high level of factual knowledge regarding the cause, natural history, transmission, and prevention of AIDS. Despite this, participants frequently behaved in ways that were potentially harmful to themselves and others. Specifically, although aware of the importance of using condoms, sexually active adolescents with hemophilia were not practicing safe sex. Restriction in the use of heat-treated clotting factor because of concerns about AIDS was also frequently reported. Professionals providing AIDS education and counseling for these individuals need to be cognizant of the concerns and social skills of this population; they should focus not only on factual information but also on the social and situational pressures confronting these teenagers, which may be more immediate determinants of their behavior and well-being. As AIDS continues to spread into the general population, these findings have relevance to AIDS education and health policy efforts aimed at all adolescents.\r"

The highest incidence occurred during the late morning period (9 AM to 12 noon). A consumer product was involved in 53.7% of the incidents. Three of four injuries were considered preventable by training and/or education or by the Haddon injury reduction strategies. Additional prospective studies are needed to develop and implement preventive measures.\r"

When isolated monocytes were incubated with human glomerular basement membrane (GBM) containing anti-GBM immune complexes, both TNF and IL-1 were produced and secreted into the medium. The time course of secretion differed, with IL-1 production being maximal after approximately 8 hours, whereas TNF levels continued to rise for 30 hours. The activities of the monocyte-derived TNF and IL-1 were inhibitable by specific antibodies. No effect was seen when monocytes were incubated separately with either GBM alone or anti-GBM IgG. The levels of TNF and IL-1 released were comparable with those induced by high concentrations of LPS, indicating that production was close to the maximal levels reported for these cells. High levels of TNF and IL-1 also were produced in response to soluble immune complexes. The results show that monocytes can produce significant levels of TNF and IL-1 in response to both surface-bound and soluble immune complexes and provide support for the participation of these monokines in glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "Gross nuclear morphology is a major diagnostic feature in the identification of subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The authors have shown that the size, shape, and chromatin distribution of the lymphocyte nuclei vary extensively both within and between samples of a subtype, and have proposed that the variations may reflect qualitative and quantitative differences in extrachromatinic components. To test this hypothesis, the organization of individual nuclear antigens in NHL and in reactive hyperplasia biopsies was examined by immunofluorescence labeling of frozen sections with previously characterized monoclonal antibodies. The results have been correlated with observations of the staining patterns produced by the antibodies in mitogenically stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Labeling pattern and intensity with each antibody were consistent between preparations of blood lymphocytes, and all four antibodies labeled all blood lymphocyte samples tested. In contrast, only 15% of the 53 biopsies were labeled by all four antibodies, although all were stained by anti-peripherin, nearly 80% by I1, and almost 60% by PI1. Antibody PI2 labeling was detected in only 20% of the samples. Variation in labeling intensity was equally extensive both within and between biopsy samples. In general, there was little homogeneity between samples of an NHL subtype as to which antigens were detected, their labeling intensity, or their pattern of intranuclear distribution. These observations are consistent with earlier reports of significant diversity in the morphology of nonchromatin components in such samples. The data support the proposition that the heterogeneity of gross nuclear morphology in nuclei of NHL biopsies may be due in part to disordered expression or abnormal organization of nuclear proteins.\r"

  ".U": "89116343\r", 
  ".W": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection may be involved in various endothelial-injury syndromes, including vasculitis and atherosclerosis. In a previous study, it was reported that HSV-infected human umbilical endothelial cells are more vulnerable to detachment mediated by granulocyte-secreted proteases. To elucidate the molecular basis of this observation, the authors examined the interaction of infected endothelial cells with the purified basement membrane proteins, fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. HSV-infected endothelial cells exhibited defects in their ability to adhere, spread, and migrate on all three matrix components. This defective adhesion could be partially overcome by increasing concentrations of fibronectin; in contrast, no abrogation of deficient binding occurs with increased levels of laminin or collagen type IV. This suggests that endothelial cells may use different surface constituents for binding to the three proteins and use multiple \"receptors\" for adhesion to the fibronectin molecule--\"receptors\" that are variably affected by HSV infection. The authors investigated this supposition by assaying adhesion of normal and infected endothelial cells to two non-overlapping cell-adhesion promoting fragments of fibronectin: 1) a 75 kd motility-promoting fragment which contains the arginyl-glycyl-aspartylserine (RGDS) adhesion sequence, and 2) a 33 kd carboxyl-terminal heparin binding fragment, which promotes cell adhesion by an RGDS-independent mechanism. Normal endothelial cells adhered and spread on both purified fragments. In contrast, while infected endothelial cells could adhere, albeit rather poorly, to high coating concentrations of the 75 kd fragment, these cells did not bind to the 33 kd heparin binding fragment of fibronectin at all. These results support the concept that endothelial cells adhere to multiple domains of fibronectin, and that HSV infection preferentially abrogates binding to the heparin-binding domain, while leaving relatively intact receptors for the RGDS-containing domain. In support, soluble RGDS significantly blocked fibronectin adhesion of infected, but not control, endothelial cells. It is concluded that HSV infection inhibits the interaction of endothelial cells with basement membrane proteins and weakens their tethering to substratum. This tethering is inadequate for proper cell spreading or movement to occur and may result in both excessive endothelial lift-off and impaired vascular repair in HSV infections.\r"

In the present studies the percentages of T cells and monocytes invading the leptomeninges during the course of acute CMV infection were compared. In addition, qualitative observations on parenchymal infiltrates were made. Such studies have not been performed previously in CMV infection of the CNS. Monocytes, defined cytochemically, predominated in the leptomeninges and in parenchymal foci. In contrast, T cells, defined immunohistologically, were found in a low percentage in the leptomeningeal reaction and only rarely in the parenchyma. These novel results differ significantly from other viral infections in which the T cell predominates in the leptomeningeal response and plays a major role in the parenchyma.\r"

Children of smoking mothers had an 18.0 per cent cumulative incidence of post-infancy wheezing through 10 years of age, compared with 16.2 per cent among children of nonsmoking mothers (risk ratio 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.21). This difference was confined to wheezing attributed to wheezy bronchitis, of which children of smokers had 7.4 per cent, and those of nonsmokers had 5.2 per cent (risk ratio 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.68). The incidence of wheezy bronchitis increased as mothers smoked more cigarettes. After multiple logistic regression analysis was used to control for paternal smoking, social status, sex, family allergy, crowding, breast-feeding, gas cooking and heating, and bedroom dampness, the association of maternal smoking with childhood wheezy bronchitis persisted. Some of this effect was explained by maternal respiratory symptoms and maternal depression, but not by neonatal problems, the child's allergic symptoms, or paternal respiratory symptoms. There was a 14 per cent increase in childhood wheezy bronchitis when mothers smoked over four cigarettes per day, and a 49 per cent increase when mothers smoked over 14 cigarettes daily.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of isoflurane on regional myocardial metabolism and blood flow, when used as an adjunct to fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia, to control intraoperative hypertension was investigated. Twenty-two patients with two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction greater than 0.5 and on beta-blockers up to the morning of surgery were studied during elective coronary artery by-pass grafting. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, and regional (great cardiac vein, GCVF) myocardial blood flow and myocardial metabolic parameters were measured. In 10 patients, both GCVF and global (coronary sinus, CSF) myocardial blood flows were recorded. Measurements were made 1) after induction of anesthesia but prior to skin incision, 2) during sternotomy, and 3) during isoflurane administration after its use to reduce arterial pressure to the presternotomy level. The increase in systemic arterial pressure during sternotomy was due to an increase in systemic vascular resistance accompanied by increases in heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, (PCWP) regional myocardial oxygen consumption and extraction, GCVF and total coronary vascular resistance. Isoflurane reduced systemic arterial pressure but not PCWP, to presternotomy levels within 6.9 +/- 0.7 minutes at an end-tidal concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.2%. Isoflurane induced a pronounced systemic and coronary vasodilatation and increases in cardiac index, heart rate and regional myocardial oxygen extraction while the GCVF/CSF ratio remained unchanged. While mean regional--MLE% values were not effected by sternotomy, in two patients myocardial lactate production was seen during sternotomy but not during isoflurane. In another two patients, isoflurane induced lactate production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we demonstrate that human AM phi, as well as PBM, can be induced to express biologically active TNF-alpha after challenge with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Furthermore, we examined the expression of TNF-alpha at the mRNA level via Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis. Normal AM phi, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, and PBM were stimulated with either IL-2 (2,000 U/ml) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 micrograms/ml) for 18 h. Specificity was demonstrated by neutralizing TNF-alpha activity with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human TNF-alpha antibody. PBM TNF-alpha biologic activity from 11 subjects challenged with either IL-2 or LPS was 19 +/- 6 and 85 +/- 15 U/ml/10(6) cells, respectively, which represented 5-fold and 21-fold increases over control values. AM phi TNF-alpha biologic activity from nine subjects was 110 +/- 28 (IL-2-mediated) and 304 +/- 69 (LPS-mediated) U/ml/10(6) cells, which represented 2- and 6-fold increases over controls. AM phi exhibited statistically greater (p less than 0.05) TNF production in response to both IL-2 and LPS as compared to PBM. IL-2 challenge resulted in an induction of TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation, as demonstrated by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. TNF-alpha mRNA was quantitated by laser densitometry for Northern blots or by counting the number of silver grains/mononuclear phagocytic cell in the in situ hybridization analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The same immunophenotypic pattern of cutaneous infiltrate was observed in both cases, despite a different histopathologic subtype (mixed cellularity in case one, nodular sclerosis in case two). The majority of infiltrating cells expressed T-lymphocyte markers, with a predominance of CD8+ phenotype. Few cells bore B-lymphocyte markers or had DRC-1+ phenotype. No CD1a+ dendritic cell was found in the dermal infiltrate. Variable numbers of cells reacted with mononuclear phagocyte markers. The authors believe that the antigenic phenotype of cutaneous Hodgkin's disease has not previously been reported. The immunophenotypic pattern of skin infiltrate is different from that described in lymphoid tissues. Such findings could be related to the previous therapy or to the possible influence of skin microenvironment.\r"

All but one patient (88.9%) achieved complete remission and then received this intensified therapy. With a median follow-up period of 25.5 months, five patients are still in complete remission, but three patients have relapsed. From the phenotypic point of view, these relapsed patients showed only very immature T-cell differentiation antigens such as CD2 and CD7 (or CD5). These results suggest that HDCA as intensified therapy for children with mediastinal NHL seems to be effective.

Two of four patients in this group showed trisomy 22; the remaining two showed a loss of a sex chromosome. The other group of patients with solely structural abnormalities is associated with a short duration from the onset of goiter to the time of operation, with normal thyroid function, and with the trend of negative tests for autoantibodies. Two of three patients in this group showed a 14q+ abnormality. These results indicate that there are two distinct type of thyroid lymphoma, chromosomal changes of which are implicated as pathogenetic factors in lymphomagenesis of different mechanisms.\r"

Since interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) are potent, synergistic OAF produced by cells of the B-cell lineage, the authors investigated the spontaneous secretion of these cytokines by 11 human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). No HMCL secreted either IL-1, the most powerful OAF, or contra IL-1. In contrast, all of the lymphoblastoid cell lines assayed produced significant IL-1 activity. Ten of the 11 HMCL secreted a significant TNF activity. This was completely eliminated by an anti-TNF beta monoclonal antibody but not affected by an anti-TNF alpha antiserum. The data from this study suggest that TNF beta is involved in myeloma bone resorption, but not IL-1, which is, however, known as one of the most potent OAF.\r"

Regional coronary flow and metabolic measurements were made in five of the seven patients. Extubation from a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 cm H2O was associated with a statistically significant rise in cardiac index from 3.44 +/- 0.23 L.min-1.m-2 to 3.73 +/- 0.15 L.min-1.m-2 related to an increase in stroke index, without significant changes in heart rate, mean arterial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Consequently the changes in myocardial oxygen consumption (8.52 +/- 0.55 to 8.85 +/- 0.93 ml.min-1) and coronary blood flow (172 +/- 18 to 179 +/- 17 ml.min-1) were less prominent than those reported during intubation, where substantial rises in myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary flow occurred. Two patients experienced cardiac lactate production but there were no changes in systemic or coronary haemodynamics, nor were there clinical or electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia. We conclude that extubation does not appear to be associated with adverse systemic or coronary haemodynamic responses in patients following coronary bypass grafting. However, the revascularized myocardium may remain vulnerable to anaerobic metabolism in the immediate postoperative period.\r"

The incidence rates in persons over 14 years of age for cancer of the renal parenchyma (3.4% per year), renal pelvis (5.5%) and bladder (2.1%) increased significantly more than that for cancer at all sites (1.2%). Thus the decrease in ESRF due to analgesic nephropathy had not, by 1983, been paralleled by a decrease in renal parenchymal or urothelial cancer.\r"

Of the present patients, 27% (11/41) had at least one episode of occult GB (three consecutive positive determinations; a total of 14 episodes). Endoscopy identified acute gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (stress ulcers) as the most frequent lesion in this group (eight patients). Sepsis was the most frequent underlying condition associated with occult GB due to stress ulcer. Hematemesis occurred in 36% (4/11) of patients with occult GB and was due to stress ulcer in three patients and to benign gastric tumor in one. No overt GB occurred in the absence of previous occult GB. We conclude that: a) risk of GB persists in critically ill ICU patients in spite of antacid prophylaxis (gastric pH greater than 3.5); b) high-risk patients can be identified through periodic testing for the presence of blood in gastric juice using the reagent; c) when occult GB occurs, treatment should be based on the endoscopy results. In the absence of acute gastroduodenal mucosal lesions, antacid prophylaxis should not be modified, and specific treatment of the identified lesion(s) should be initiated. In the presence of stress lesions, antacid prophylaxis should be reinforced if the pH of the gastric content is less than 3.5 and a septic complication should be actively sought if the pH is greater than 3.5.\r"

  ".W": "Because diabetic vascular disease is accompanied by a state of hypercoagulability, manifested by increased thrombin activity and foci of intravascular coagulation, we investigated whether a specific procoagulant property of the endothelium--production and surface expression of tissue factor--is modified by elevated glucose concentrations. In unperturbed human vascular endothelial cells, tissue factor mRNA and expression of the functional protein were undetectable and were not induced by 10-12 days of exposure to 30 mM glucose. In thrombin-stimulated cultures, tissue-factor expression was related inversely to cellular density, with confluent cultures producing (per 10(5) cells) half the amount of tissue factor measured in sparse cultures. Cells exposed to high glucose and studied when cell number and thymidine incorporation were identical to control cells manifested increased tissue-factor mRNA level and functional protein production in response to thrombin (P = .002). This effect was not attributable to hypertonicity and was not observed after short exposure to high glucose. In contrast, the tissue-factor response to interleukin 1, a modulator of endothelial function in the context of host defense, was decreased in cells cultured in high glucose (P = .04). These findings indicate that exposure to high glucose can alter tissue-factor gene expression in perturbed vascular endothelium. The reciprocal effects of high glucose on the tissue-factor response to thrombin and interleukin 1 points to different pathways of tissue-factor stimulation by the two agents and suggests functional consequences pertinent to the increased thrombin activity and compromised host-defense mechanisms observed in diabetes.\r"

The most common theory to explain this has been the operation of some as yet undefined genetic risk factor in these populations. Searching for some common environmental factor for gallstones in Chileans and North American Indians, we found that beans and other legumes are common foods consumed by both populations. In this study we tested the hypothesis that legume intake may favor the production of biliary cholesterol supersaturation. We studied 20 young men subjected to a diet containing 120 g/day of legumes and a control diet without legumes for a period of 1 mo each. Both diets supplied identical quantities of energy, carbohydrates, protein, total fat, fiber, and cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration decreased by 16% (p less than 0.001) after the legume diet. Biliary cholesterol saturation increased in 19 of the 20 subjects; the mean of the group markedly increased from 110% to 169% (p less than 0.001) after the legume diet. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that legume intake is a potential risk factor for cholesterol gallstone disease.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the clinical application of a pressure-sensitive gauge that allows the noninvasive measurement of the pressure of esophageal varices at endoscopy. The study was performed in 70 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Among them, 47 had bled from the varices and 23 had varices but had not bled. In addition to measurements of variceal pressure, the size of the varices was estimated semiquantitatively at endoscopy. This allowed an estimate of the tension on the wall of the varices as the product of the transmural pressure and the estimated radius of the varices. Most patients had a standard hemodynamic evaluation of portal hypertension, with measurements of wedged and free hepatic venous pressures, and of azygos blood flow. These were performed within 24 h of the variceal pressure measurements. Variceal pressure was significantly higher in bleeders than in nonbleeders (15.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 12.1 +/- 2.6 mmHg, p less than 0.001) in spite of a similar portal pressure in both groups (20.1 +/- 5.1 vs. 20.4 +/- 7.6 mmHg, NS). More than 60% of the bleeders, but only 22% of the nonbleeders had a variceal pressure greater than or equal to 15 mmHg (p less than 0.005). Among nonbleeders, variceal pressure was higher in patients with large varices (13.9 +/- 2 mmHg, n = 9) than in those with small varices (10.9 +/- 2.4 mmHg, n = 14) (p less than 0.01). Estimates of variceal wall tension further exaggerated the differences between bleeders and nonbleeders (66.1 +/- 22.6 vs. 32.0 +/- 19.8 mmHg.mm, p less than 0.001). More than 50% of bleeders, but just 9% of nonbleeders had an estimated variceal tension greater than 50 mmHg.mm (p less than 0.001). Our findings support the role of an increased variceal pressure in the pathogenesis of variceal hemorrhage, and suggest that this noninvasive technique can be valuable in assessing the risk of variceal hemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension.\r"

After a minimum follow-up interval of 2 yr (range, 27-65 mo), major rebleeding rates were 65% for propranolol alone, 45% for endoscopic sclerotherapy plus propranolol, and 60% for transhepatic sclerotherapy plus propranolol.

Thirty-three patients (34%) never received propranolol; 8 due to medical contraindications and 25 because they died or bled enough to meet the definition of treatment failure within 3 or 4 days of randomizations (no significant differences among treatment groups). Patients assigned to propranolol alone bled sooner, bled more units, and had a higher mortality rate than patients treated by endoscopic sclerotherapy plus propranolol. Patients treated with transhepatic sclerotherapy plus propranolol had intermediate results. Propranolol alone is inadequate treatment for esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with advanced liver disease.\r"

Very little 25-OH-D3 was found in bone, although it was the major vitamin D metabolite in serum (90%). In elective patients bone levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 were similar to those in serum; however, in bone from around pertrochanteric fractures, but not from subcapital or patellar fractures, the concentrations of these compounds were considerably increased.

The determinant recognized by T cells, HEL(52-61) was composed of L-amino acids whereas the 12 amino acid extension on each side of this core were composed of D-epimers. This peptide, HEL(40-73) was resistant to proteolysis, except in the core region, where any cleavage would destroy the determinant. Initially HEL(40-73) was shown to be able to stimulate the HEL specific T cell, 3A9, indicating that an I-Ak molecule can bind and present large peptides that extend beyond the theoretical binding groove. HEL(40-73) was then used to examine the proteolytic sensitivity of determinants recognized by T cells. If HEL(40-73) was treated with chymotrypsin before binding to I-Ak, the determinant was totally destroyed; however, if HEL(40-73) was allowed to first bind to I-Ak, then the determinant became resistant to chymotrypsin cleavage. Thus an Ia molecule can protect a determinant from proteolytic degradation, a finding that has important implications for proposed pathways of Ag processing.\r"

  ".W": "The immunomodulatory effects of an IgM anti-CD3 mAb (38.1) were investigated. 38.1 was distinct from other anti-CD3 mAb, in that it was rapidly modulated from the cell surface in the absence of a secondary antibody. Although 38.1 induced an immediate increase in intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i by highly purified T cells, it did not induce entry of the cells into the cell cycle in the absence of accessory cells (AC) or a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester. Clearing of 38.1 from the surface of AC-depleted T cells, documented both by immunofluorescence and by functional activity, was rapid, with markedly reduced levels of initially bound mAb observed after a 1 to 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C and complete modulation noted after a 5-h incubation. Despite rapid modulation of 38.1, the T cells continued to express substantial amounts of surface CD3, suggesting there is a rapid rate of turnover of CD3 molecules on resting T cells. After modulation of 38.1 bound CD3, T cells were markedly inhibited in their capacity to respond to PHA. Inhibition could be overcome by culturing the cells with supplemental AC or IL-2. The inhibitory effects of 38.1 could be mimicked by briefly pulsing cells with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, that had no effect on surface expression of CD3. 38.1- or ionomycin-pulsed cells were inhibited in their subsequent response to PHA even when exposures were carried out in the presence of EGTA to prevent increases in [Ca2+]i from extracellular sources. Inhibition could not be accounted for by an inability of the ionomycin-treated or 38.1-modulated T cells to increase [Ca2+]i in response to PHA. These studies demonstrate that a state of T cell nonresponsiveness can be induced by modulating CD3 with an anti-CD3 mAb in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. A brief increase in [Ca2+]i resulting from mobilization of internal calcium stores appears to be sufficient to induce this state of T cell nonresponsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "As previously reported, LPS and 8-derivatized guanosine (both generators of IL-1 release), as well as IL-1 itself interfere with the in vivo induction of tolerance to DHGG in A/J mice. In the present studies it was demonstrated that desensitization of either A/J or CBA/CaJ mice with LPS aborts the ability of LPS to interfere with the induction of tolerance to DHGG. The abrogation of the ability of LPS to interfere with tolerance by LPS desensitization is not the result of neutralization of LPS by antibody produced to LPS during desensitization. Desensitization with LPS also aborts the interference with tolerance induction by 7-methyl-8-oxoguanosine. LPS desensitization inhibits the ability of LPS and/or 7-methyl-8-oxoguanosine to both convert a tolerogenic signal to an immunogenic signal and interfere with the induction of a tolerant state to a subsequent injection of Ag. The effects resulting from desensitization may be in part attributed to the depletion of IL-1. LPS desensitization also modulates the antibody response to injection of the AG, AHGG. Desensitization with LPS markedly suppresses the antibody response to a subsequent injection of AHGG in CBA/CaJ mice. Desensitization with LPS also inhibits the anti-HGG antibody response in A/J mice, but in this strain its effect is dependent on the route of injection of AHGG. In an experiment directly comparing the responses of normal and desensitized A/J mice to either intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of AHGG, desensitization only suppressed the response in mice injected with AHGG i.p.. Desensitization with LPS also inhibits the ability of LPS to act as an adjuvant in a subsequent antibody response to AHGG. Not only does desensitization interfere with the primary antibody response to AHGG, but it also interferes with the secondary response, suggesting that the primary injection after desensitization induces a state of immunologic tolerance.\r"

Two T cell clones, HTC1 and HTC2, were further studied. These clones, which exhibit cell surface characteristics of cytotoxic cells, were specific for only syngeneic thyroid cells (allogeneic thyroid cells or syngeneic epithelial cells were never lysed by these hybridomas). Moreover, by using Ag-pulsed syngeneic macrophages as targets, syngeneic cytotoxicity was shown to be specific for thyroglobulin and not for a nonrelated Ag. The lysis obtained with these autoreactive thyroid-specific T cell clones is restricted to class I major histocompatibility Ag. This property is assessed by both the blocking of syngeneic cytotoxicity toward thyroid epithelial cells or thyroglobulin-pulsed macrophages only by anti-class I mAb and by the detection of specific lysis of target cells exclusively when effector hybrid cells and target thyroid epithelial cells or thyroglobulin-pulsed macrophages shared at least class I major histocompatibility Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Deficient responses by NK cells may contribute to the susceptibility of human newborns to severe HSV infections. Furthermore, HSV disseminates widely during neonatal infection and may also infect and interfere with the function of blood mononuclear cells (MNC). To determine whether the function of newborn NK cells would be affected by contact with HSV, and whether newborn NK cells might be permissive for HSV replication, newborn MNC were cultured with HSV in vitro for 3 days. Before culture, the intracellular calcium mobilization in newborn NK cells induced by mAb to CD2 and CD16 did not differ from that of adult NK cells. This result argues against immaturity of an early NK cell activation event in human newborns. After culture with HSV the Ca2+ flux response was unaffected by lysis of K562 targets by newborn NK cells and NK-dependent suppression of HSV replication in fibroblasts were preserved or increased. Incorporation of thymidine by NKH-1 cells following stimulation with PHA and IL-2 was not suppressed. NK cells recovered from these cultures did not contain infectious HSV and synthesis of HSV-specific proteins was not detected by immunoprecipitation although HSV genome was detected by DNA hybridization. Our results extend the in vitro model stimulation systems in which newborn NK cells respond positively to include triggering through the CD2 Ag, cross-linking of cell surface CD 16 Ag and response to a pathogen, HSV.\r"

By studying the number and antigenic specificity of B cells activated in the course of this disease, we found that a series of reproducible changes in the humoral immune system were induced by retroviral infection. The rate of B cell proliferation and the proportion of B cells activated to secrete Ig increased by nearly 10-fold at 4 wk post inoculation. B cells producing antibodies reactive with a panel of three conventional Ag and five autoantigens were stimulated simultaneously and proportionally to secrete, demonstrating that such activation was polyclonal in nature. At 12 wk post infection, the number of Ig-secreting B cells continued to rise and significant hypergammaglobulinemia developed. At 16 wk post infection, immunostimulation gave way to immunosuppression, as evidenced by a slight decline in the number of Ig-secreting lymphocytes and a sharp reduction in the concentration of serum antibody. At this time, the B cell repertoires of infected mice diverged markedly from those of uninfected animals. These changes are comparable to those found in some patients infected with HIV, and provide a useful model to study the association between retroviral infection and regulatory abnormalities of the humoral immune system.\r"

Thus, both 0-81-Id and NE-1-Id are of the cross-reactive Id that are commonly present among anti-DNA antibodies. In order to manipulate the production of anti-DNA antibodies by human PBL, we used mouse antiidiotypic mAb or those conjugated with a cytotoxic agent, neocarzinostatin. Treatment with the conjugates caused profound suppression of anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibody synthesis related to 0-81- and NE-1-Id. This was attributed to the specific killing of the clones bearing anti-DNA Id among the lymphocytes, evidenced by the indirect rosette formation tests. The Id-mediated suppression was not solely due to selective elimination of Id-positive B cells, because 50 to 92% of anti-DNA antibodies were suppressed by treatment with the conjugates. This was supported by flow cytometry analysis that showed a decrease of anti-Id-reactive cells when T cells were treated with the conjugates. This method, then, will permit an analysis of the question as to whether T cells reactive to anti-idiotypic antibodies might participate in the regulatory mechanism for anti-DNA production and, in addition, may lead to a new therapy for SLE.\r"

  ".U": "89124356\r", 
  ".W": "Because T cell responses are critical for defense against viral infections, a series of synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequence for HIV-1 proteins gp41, pg120, gag, and viral polymerase were used to test the T cell proliferative response of HIV-1 seropositive individuals. Of HIV-1-infected donors from various clinical categories 90% (27/30) had sensitized cells that proliferated in response to at least one of 21 HIV peptides tested. Cells from HIV seronegative controls did not proliferate (0/9) in response to these HIV peptides. Individuals with fewer clinical manifestations of HIV-1 disease responded to a greater number of peptides (average for asymptomatic seropositives = 8.1 peptides; AIDS patients averaged 2.0). The number of peptides recognized also correlated with absolute number of CD4+ cells, but not with delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to a (non-HIV) battery of Ag. However, clinical stage at no time correlated with the response to any particular peptide. Response patterns differed considerably among individuals, and some peptides stimulated proliferation in many (48%) HIV-infected donors (peptides gp41-2 and pol-3), whereas another peptide elicited no T cell response in any donor tested (peptide gp120-8). We have also begun to investigate the basis for individual heterogeneity of T lymphocyte proliferative responses of HIV-infected donors to the 21 HIV synthetic peptides. Peptide structure and HLA class II determinants both influenced patterns of lymphocyte responses. Reactivity correlated with peptide size, the presence of alpha and beta secondary structure and lack of reverse turn potential. Hydropathy and charge had no predictive value. Peptides derived from HIV sequences that vary highly among strains tended to be recognized less frequently. HIV-infected lymphocyte donors were HLA typed to examine the influence of the MHC on T lymphocyte proliferation. Analysis of the frequencies of individuals reacting to specific peptides, when compared to the allele frequencies in the population at large, indicated association of some responses to DR alleles. More DR association was observed with peptides that showed \"moderate\" reactivity than with those that were \"highly\" reactive. We suggest that highly reactive peptides are capable of forming a structure closer to an \"ideal\" T cell epitope that can associate with many DR alleles. In contrast, \"moderately\" reactive determinants have less favorable structures for interaction, are more limited in their ability to interact and therefore show more restriction to specific class II alleles.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigates the role of thymic stroma-derived T cell growth factor (TSTGF) in promoting the growth of L3T4- Lyt2- (double-negative) thymocytes. Partially purified TSTGF samples were prepared from the culture supernatant of a newly established thymic stromal cell line, MRL104.8a. The TSTGF alone induced only marginal proliferation of double-negative thymocytes, whereas this factor exerted a potent growth-promoting effect on these cells in combination with PMA. Because such an enhanced proliferation was not inhibited by anti-IL-4 or anti-IL-2R antibody, this was not due to the stimulation of an autocrine mechanism involving the production and utilization of IL-4 or IL-2. In scrutinizing PMA-equivalent physiologic substance(s), IL-1 was revealed to be capable of replacing the role of PMA in the above co-stimulation cultures and including enhanced proliferation of double-negative thymocytes in combination with TSTGF. Although TSTGF plus IL-2 or IL-4 also exhibited an appreciable or moderate synergistic effect on the growth of double-negative thymocytes, its magnitude was weaker compared with that obtained by TSTGF plus IL-1. More important, the strikingly enhanced proliferation was induced in the combinations of TSTGF, IL-1, and IL-2 or IL-4 under conditions in which the proliferation induced by IL-1 plus IL-4 or IL-1 plus IL-2 was marginal or slight. Furthermore, such strongly enhanced proliferation was also observed in the double-negative thymocyte population which was additionally depleted of T3+ cells (namely, the L3T4- Lyt-2- T3- or dull population). These results indicate the crucial role of TSTGF in the proliferation of immature thymocytes by synergy with various cytokines.\r"

We demonstrate that murine rTNF-alpha induces the proliferation of CT6, a murine T cell line previously thought to be responsive only to IL-2. This activity appears to be the result of the direct action of murine rTNF-alpha on the CT6 cells because neither 1) murine IL-2 or murine IL-4, lymphokines also capable of inducing CT6 proliferation, were detected in culture supernatants from murine rTNF-alpha-treated CT6 cells nor 2) did antibodies specific for IL-2 or IL-4 inhibit murine rTNF-alpha-induced CT6 proliferation. Unlike many of the activities displayed by TNF-alpha, its ability to induce CT6 cell proliferation shows strict species specificity as indicated by the failure of human rTNF-alpha to stimulate these cells. Flow cytometric analysis and binding of radiolabeled TNF-alpha have indicated that receptors for TNF-alpha on these cells are specific for murine TNF-alpha. The ability of murine rTNF-alpha to induce the proliferation of certain T cell lines further indicates that this molecule plays an important role in regulation of T cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

We searched for normal, not virally transformed, B lymphocytes with analogous properties, using tonsils as the source of B cells. Unseparated tonsillar leukocytes contained cells capable of PMA-triggered superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT+ cells) well in excess of phagocytes (18.9 +/- 6.4% NBT+ cells with 1.3 +/- 0.9% granulocytes and 1.9 +/- 2.3% monocytes/macrophages, n = 8). NBT reduction was also inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, a selective inhibitor of phagocytic NADPH-oxidase. Cross-linking of surface Ig was equally effective as PMA in inducing NBT reduction among tonsillar leukocytes. NBT+ cells co-distributed with B cells on Percoll density gradients and were enriched among purified B cells obtained by SRBC rosetting twice and Sephadex G10 adherence (47.8 +/- 15.2% NBT+ cells among 90.5 +/- 5.5% B cells, 4.8 +/- 5.1% T cells, 1.2 +/- 0.77% monocytes/macrophages, and 0.73 +/- 0.6% granulocytes, n = 10). Further, mAb 7D5, directed against an extracellularly located epitope of the small subunit of cytochrome b-245 of phagocytes, stained the majority of tonsillar B cells (85 +/- 9.2% 7D5+ cells and 91.6 +/- 4.04% B cells, n = 3). Superoxide production, staining with 7D5 antibody, and expression of mRNA for the beta chain of cytochrome b-245 were further analyzed in cell lines. The EBV-BLCL F1 and the Burkitt lymphoma P3HR-1 both carried 7D5-detectable cytochrome b-245 Ag and expressed mRNA for the beta chain of the cytochrome b, both in similar amounts. However, only F1, not P3HR-1, was capable of PMA-triggered superoxide production. These data indicate that also normal nontransformed B lymphocytes possess the capacity to generate superoxide by a system apparently similar to phagocytic NADPH-oxidase, provisionally termed \"B cell oxidase.\" Discrepancies observed in certain B cells and lines between expression of cytochrome b components and stimulus-induced superoxide production may be related to an absence or low level of other oxidase components or of the signal transduction mechanism. Conceivably, production of superoxide and derived reactive oxygen species by B cells may have cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, or mutagenic effects on the B cells themselves or on cells in their immediate vicinity.\r"

To investigate the role of endogenously produced growth factors in mediating proliferation of these effector cell types, the transcription of IL-2 during infection was studied. We report that IL-2 is transcribed in vivo by mouse spleen cells during infection with LCMV. The time course of transcription corresponds to CTL activation, to the accumulation of Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cells in the spleen, to the incorporation of [3H]TdR by B cell-depleted spleen lymphocytes, and to production of IL-2 by these cells. At the peak of CTL activation and proliferation, both Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ populations transcribed IL-2. The results strongly support a role for IL-2 in mediating CTL proliferation during LCMV infection. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that Lyt-2+ cells can transcribe helper factors such as IL-2 in vivo, which may act to promote endogenous effector cell proliferation.\r"

This study investigated the relationship between production of a factor with IL-2-like activity and the regulation of T cell-mediated responses in jirds experimentally infected with B. pahangi. A factor present in culture supernatants of mitogen-stimulated jird lymphocytes supported the proliferation of murine CTLL cells and provided the basis for an IL-2 assay. Mitogen induced proliferative responses and IL-2 production of spleen cells but not lymph node cells from pre-patent and microfilaremic jirds were suppressed. Both B. pahangi Ag-induced proliferative responsiveness and IL-2 production of spleen cells from microfilaremic jirds were also suppressed relative to lymph node cells from the same animals or spleen cells from B. pahangi immunized or prepatent jirds. Depletion of histamine receptor-bearing cells restored the ability of spleen cells from microfilaremic jirds to produce significant levels of IL-2. In addition, in add-mixture experiments, spleen cells from microfilaremic jirds suppressed Ag-induced IL-2 production by cells from either B. pahangi- or KHL-immunized jirds. Exogenous IL-2 failed to reconstitute the suppressed Ag-induced proliferative response of spleen cells from microfilaremic jirds. This study demonstrates that the down-regulation of immune responses in B. pahangi infection is a cell-mediated event and is associated with an inability to produce IL-2.\r"

The binding of RS1.1.3 to idiotypic antibody could be inhibited by specific Ag. Intraperitoneal immunization of mice with purified RS1.1.3 antibody-induced effective immunity against Moloney murine sarcoma virus challenge. A single injection of RS1.1.3 7 days before virus challenge resulted in a 27% reduction in tumor load compared to non-immune control mice challenged with the same dose of virus, whereas multiple injections of RS1.1.3 before virus challenge resulted in a 75% reduction in tumor load. The protective effect of anti-idiotype immunization appeared to be T dependent, because immunization of athymic mice had no effect on their susceptibility to tumor virus challenge. Administration of the anti-idiotypic antibody after virus inoculation caused an increase in tumor load of nearly 50% compared to non-immune controls. BALB/c mice immunized with RS1.1.3 developed anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies, as well as M-MuLV Ag-specific antibodies. Analysis of sera from RS1.1.3-immune mice subsequently challenged with Moloney murine sarcoma virus indicated an inverse relationship between tumor load and M-MuLV-specific serum IgG titers induced by the RS1.1.3 immunization. These results indicate that anti-idiotypic mAb may be used as immunogen to induce Ag-specific antibody responses, and to cause effective immunity to a retro-virus-induced tumor.\r"

Effectors from HSV-immune donors mediated virus-specific lysis of both monocyte and macrophage targets, whereas effectors from non-immune donors failed to mediate target cell lysis. Mean virus-specific lysis of autologous monocytes was (8.5 +/- (+/- 2.0)%) compared to a threefold greater virus-specific lysis of autologous macrophages (24.7 (+/- 4.3)%). More than 70% of this lysis was mediated by CD16- T lymphocytes. Further analysis demonstrated that the majority of the lysis against autologous and allogeneic targets was HLA-DR-restricted and mediated by CD4+ CTL. However, CD8+ CTL also contributed to the lysis of autologous targets as well as allogeneic targets having a common HLA-A and/or -B determinant. The HLA-restricted cytotoxicity was virus-specific as HSV-infected, but not CMV-infected, cells were lysed. CTL-mediated lysis of HSV-infected monocytes and macrophages may be of significance in the anti-viral and immunoregulatory host response.\r"

Differences in virus spread prior to appearance of the immune response could not explain the observed differences in clearance rate. On the other hand, inefficient clearance always correlated with low T cell responsiveness measured in terms of virus-specific cytotoxicity and delayed-type hypersensitivity, whereas no correlation was found with regard to NK cell activity and antiviral antibody response. Analysis of F1 progeny between H-2 identical high and low responder strains showed that low responsiveness with regard to all three parameters was recessive, indicating that natural tolerance is not the mechanism explaining non-MHC dependent low responsiveness in this system. The implications of these findings are discussed with specific reference to the role of MHC genes in controlling resistance to infectious diseases.\r"

  ".U": "89124382\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that the frequency of murine CTL precursors (CTLp) for human class I molecules is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that for murine class I alloantigens, and that this is due to species-specific structural differences between these molecules. Transgenic mice expressing the human class I MHC Ag HLA-A2.1 were used to examine changes in the frequency of class I HLA-specific precursors after T cell differentiation in an HLA-A2.1 positive environment. The HLA-A2.1 gene product was expressed at levels comparable to those of the endogenous H-2Db molecule in thymus, bone marrow, and spleen. By limiting dilution analysis, it was observed that the frequencies of CTLp in transgenic mice responding to the human alloantigens HLA-B7 or HLA-A2.2 were comparable to or lower than those in normal C57BL/6 mice, regardless of whether the Ag was presented on human or murine cells. Thus, expression of a human class I molecule in these animals did not result in an expansion of the number of CTLp specific for other human class I Ag. In addition, the frequency of HLA-A2.1-restricted, influenza specific CTLp was substantially lower than the frequency of H-2b restricted CTLp, indicating a poor utilization of HLA-A2.1 as a restricting element. Finally, the frequencies of CTLp for HLA-A2.1 expressed on syngeneic murine tumor cells were decreased significantly. Thus, expression of HLA-A2.1 in these animals appeared to induced tolerance to this Ag. Interestingly, however, these mice were not tolerant to the HLA-A2.1 molecule expressed on human cells. This indicates that the HLA-A2.1 associated epitopes expressed on murine and human cells differ and suggests that, under these circumstances, HLA-A2.1 acts as a restricting element for human nominal Ag. These results are discussed in the context of current models of T cell repertoire development.\r"

  ".W": "The growth, phenotype, in vitro cytolytic characteristics, and in vivo antitumor activity of murine splenocytes stimulated with anti-murine CD3 mAb in combination with IL-2 as compared with IL-2 alone was investigated. When cultured for 12 days with anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2, murine splenocytes increased 100- to 4000-fold in number compared with only 6- to 20-fold for cultures stimulated with IL-2 alone. Anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2 activated cultures developed high lymphokine-activated killer activity against NK-resistant targets including the P815 mastocytoma cell line and fresh MCA 106 sarcoma. Peak cytotoxicity on a per cell basis developed by day 8 after anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2 activation. A large proportion of the total cytolytic activity of long term anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2-stimulated cultures was related to the presence of anti-CD3 in the assay, indicating enhancement of cytotoxicity by activated CD3+ T cells. Phenotypic analysis indicated that anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2-stimulated cultures contained heterogeneous populations of T cells with increased percentages of both CD4+ and CD8+ phenotypes compared with cultures stimulated with IL-2 alone. Anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2-stimulated cells were tested for their in vivo antitumor activity by using C57BL/6 mice bearing MCA 106 sarcoma pulmonary metastases. IL-2-activated murine killer cells were given in combination with in vivo IL-2 and indomethacin, the latter of which was shown to potentiate the antitumor effect of IL-2. When given on day 5 after tumor inoculation, cell doses as low as 5 x 10(6) anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2-stimulated cells per mouse significantly reduced the number of pulmonary metastases (p less than 0.005). Thus, activation with the combination of anti-CD3 mAb + IL-2 produces rapidly expanding cultures of cytolytic cells with demonstrated in vivo antitumor efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have shown that a human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL, exhibits clonal heterogeneity within its Ag receptor, as revealed by varying reactivity patterns with a panel of anti-idiotype mAb. We now extend these findings to another human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, SUP-T13, and to two fresh human chronic lymphocytic leukemias, JE and EF. In the two cell lines, two types of Ag receptor variants could be found: those that retained a receptor molecule but lost reactivity with an anti-idiotype mAb (idiotype variants), and those which had lost surface receptor expression completely (receptor-negative variants). The idiotype variants, at least in HPB-ALL, have differentially glycosylated receptor alpha-chains from the parent. The receptor-negative cells, in HPB-ALL as well as in SUP-T13, produce cytoplasmic receptor and CD3 proteins but do not transport them to the surface. Neither idiotype nor receptor-negative variants could be detected in either of the fresh tumors of chronic lymphocytic leukemias. The limit of sensitivity in these analyses was about 0.05%. We conclude that antigen receptor variants can spontaneously occur in cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemias, but are infrequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemias in vivo, and that therapy with anti-idiotype mAb may be a viable strategy for these malignancies.\r"

Intravaginal vaccination of mice with an attenuated strain of HSV-2 rapidly induces immunity to a lethal intravaginal challenge with wild-type HSV-2. This resistance is transferrable to syngeneic mice with genital lymph node (GLN) cells but not with cells from other lymphoid sources. Here we demonstrate that minimal numbers of HSV-2-stimulated GLN T lymphocytes are required for resistance to genital infection by HSV-2 and that such cells migrate preferentially into HSV-2-infected genital tissue. Furthermore, the results suggest that HSV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes from the GLN may be one effector cell population participating locally in genital immunity to the virus. These findings indicate that mucosal immunity to genital HSV-2 infection requires the antigen stimulation of migratory T cells in the GLN.\r"

The status of EBV infection in this group was evaluated based on serological evidence of EBV-specific antibody responses. The geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibody to EBV capsid antigen (EBV-VCA) (1:154) and EBV early antigen (EA) (1:16) in 141 HIV-seropositive men were significantly higher than respective titers in 452 HIV seronegative men (1:95 and 1:12). Antibody titers to EBV were higher in HIV-infected men with lymphadenopathy than in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men. However, these correlation were less evident in patients with AIDS-related complex. Elevated antibody titers to EBV were found to be independent of levels of total serum IgG. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody titers were also found to be significantly increased among HIV-seropositive men, independent of total IgG. Antibody titers to EBV were not correlated with those to CMV in either HIV-seronegative or HIV-seropositive men. Subjects without evidence of HIV infection, but who had high antibody titers to EBV-VCA and EBV-EA, had elevated mean numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, and lower levels of CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios compared to subjects with low EBV-antibody titers. This study suggests that the elevated levels of circulating antibodies against EBV in homosexual men are associated with loss of control of latent EBV due to HIV infection.\r"

The possibility that this may be related to a disorder of reticuloendothelial ferritin metabolism was examined by studying ferritin release from mononuclear cells. Ferritin release was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four patients with hemochromatosis who had not received treatment, from six patients with hemochromatosis who had received treatment, and from 10 age- and gender-matched controls by using a modified hemolytic plaque assay. Ferritin release from the hemochromatotic cells was enhanced when compared with that of controls, and added iron stimulated ferritin release to a comparable degree in both groups. Enhanced ferritin release above matched control values was found both in cells from patients with hemochromatosis with partial phlebotomy who had high serum ferritin values and in cells from patients with hemochromatosis with full phlebotomy who had normal serum ferritin values. The increased ferritin release observed in these studies may signify abnormal reticuloendothelial iron metabolism in hemochromatosis.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanism of heparin-mediated platelet aggregation in 11 patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia. Severe thrombocytopenia (16,000 to 66,000 platelets/microliters) developed in each patient during heparin therapy, and platelet aggregation occurred in vitro when heparin was added to mixtures of patient plasma and normal platelet-rich plasma. In 10 patients, heparin-initiated platelet aggregation was inhibited by preincubation of mixtures of normal platelet-rich plasma and heparin-associated thrombocytopenia plasma with monoclonal antiglycoprotein Ib antibodies 6D1 or LJ-Ib1. Both antibodies are directed against the von Willebrand factor binding site on glycoprotein Ib and inhibit only ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. Purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia also supported heparin-induced aggregation, but equivalent amounts of antigen-binding fragments [F(ab')2] did not. We also found that F(ab')2 of LJ-Lb1 did not inhibit heparin-induced platelet aggregation but retained inhibitory activity against ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. The monoclonal antibody 3G6, directed against the alpha-chain of glycoprotein Ib but not inhibitory of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, had no effect on heparin-induced platelet aggregation. Antibodies to von Willebrand factor that inhibit ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination did not inhibit heparin-mediated platelet aggregation, but antibodies to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa blocked aggregation. These data suggest that platelet aggregation in heparin-associated thrombocytopenia may be initiated by an interaction between patient IgG, heparin, and the platelet surface. Platelet activation appears to be mediated by a platelet surface crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Febrile response, protein kinetics, urinary end products of protein metabolism, and plasma acute phase protein levels were studied in rats given a pyrogenic dose of LEM or saline solution, and these same indicators were studied after the administration of the same dose of LEM plus 2 mg/kg indomethacin 3 weeks after a portacaval shunt (PCS) or sham operation. In both surgical groups given LEM, a maximum of 1.1 degrees C fever was observed. LEM increased protein turnover and urinary excretion of nitrogen and urea in sham-operated rats but not in the PCS animals. Administration of indomethacin decreased the plasma oxidation of L[1-14C]leucine and prevented the increased excretion of total nitrogen and urea in sham-operated animals treated with LEM. PCS animals showed a constant excretion of nitrogen and urea independent of treatment. alpha 1-Acid glycoprotein levels increased significantly in sham-operated animals treated with LEM but not in the PCS group until indomethacin was added. The coadministration of LEM and indomethacin in shams also enhanced the levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein over values found with LEM alone. These findings confirm the catabolic effect of LEM in normal animals and identify the essential role of the liver in the acute phase response. The data also suggest that indomethacin may modify the acute phase response by reducing plasma amino acid oxidation as well as enhancing the levels of some specific acute phase proteins.\r"

Three hundred twenty uncomplicated routine vaginal deliveries (185 with exploration and sponge curettage, 135 without) were prospectively analyzed for differences in outcome with regard to postpartum hemorrhage, postpartum infection, and the patient's perception of pain. Results revealed there to be no clinically or statistically significant difference between these two groups in postpartum bleeding, postpartum white blood cell counts, and postpartum fever during the three-day postdelivery hospitalization. All patients were followed for six weeks. Five of 185 patients (2.7 percent) in the explored group returned for postpartum bleeding complications, one requiring hospital admission. Three of 135 (2.2 percent) returned for postpartum bleeding in the unexplored group, none requiring hospital admission. No patients in either group had complications with postpartum endometritis in the follow-up period. The patient's perception of pain was significantly higher in the explored and curettaged group as opposed to the unexplored group (P less than .0002). This study reveals that routine elective postpartum manual exploration and sponge curettage of the uterus is a painful procedure that is not clinically indicated for reducing the potential risk of postpartum hemorrhage or endometritis and is unnecessary following routine vaginal delivery.\r"

The goal of the study was to identify a dose and schedule of IL-2 to generate maximal immune modulation with tolerable toxicity. Such a regimen might allow the addition of other treatment modalities and/or prolonged treatment duration in later trials. Each patient received IL-2 as a continuous 24-hour infusion once weekly for 4 weeks and then twice weekly for 4 weeks. Five treatment groups received from 10(3) U/m2 to 3 x 10(7) U/m2 per 24-hour infusion. The maximal tolerated dose was 3 x 10(7) U/m2/d twice weekly. Patients treated twice weekly at 1 x 10(7) and 3 x 10(7) U/m2/d had immune modulation in terms of lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, increased natural killer (NK) activity, and elevated numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing CD16, OKT10/Leu-17, and Leu-19 surface markers. Endogenous generation of peripheral blood lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity was demonstrated by lysis of NK-resistant Daudi targets, in patients treated at 3 x 10(7) U/m2/d. Biochemical and hematological abnormalities were moderate and reversible. Clinical toxicity included hypotension, myalgia, arthralgia, stomatitis, fever, fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, diarrhea, and oliguria at high doses. Cardiovascular toxicity was tolerable for most patients and reversed after IL-2 was stopped. Two of six melanoma patients at 3 x 10(7) U/m2/d achieved partial responses by the end of the eighth week. This IL-2 schedule appears to produce potentially clinically useful immune enhancement with tolerable toxicity.\r"

A prodromal illness comprising vomiting, diarrhea, listlessness, and fever was present in 84% of the cases. Acute onset of shock, convulsions and coma, bleeding (or laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation), elevated plasma activity of hepatic enzymes, acidosis, and impaired renal function was present in every case. Twenty patients died, and all the survivors are neurologically damaged. At postmortem examination, intravascular microthrombi coexisting with hemorrhages and petechiae were found in most organs. Centrilobular liver necrosis and cerebral edema were prominent features. No microbiologic cause for the disorder was identified, but decreased plasma levels of the protease inhibitors alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, together with increased levels of circulating proteolytic enzymes, were frequently present. An overrepresentation of the uncommon variant phenotypes of alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in first-degree relatives of affected patients (four had the MZ phenotype, and one each the MS or MC phenotype, of 19 relatives studied). Abnormal accumulation of alpha 1-antitrypsin was detected immunohistochemically in the livers of six of the patients. Defective protease inhibitor production or release may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder.\r"

DESIGN: Longitudinal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 6 months' duration. SETTING: Patients from private pediatric practice, Madison, Wisconsin. PATIENTS: Sequential sampling of 46 human milk-fed white infants; 24 received 400 IU/day of vitamin D2, and 22 received placebo. An additional 12 patients were followed who received standard infant formula. Eighty-three percent of patients completed a full 6 months of the study. MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS: Ultraviolet B light exposure and measurements of growth did not differ between groups. At 6 months, the human milk groups did not differ significantly in bone mineral content or serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, although total 25-hydroxyvitamin D values were significantly less in the unsupplemented human milk group (23.53 +/- 9.94 vs 36.96 +/- 11.86 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 serum concentrations were significantly higher in the unsupplemented human milk-fed group compared with the supplemented group (21.77 +/- 9.73 vs 11.74 +/- 10.27 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) by 6 months of age. CONCLUSION: Unsupplemented, human milk-fed infants had no evidence of vitamin D deficiency during the first 6 months of life.\r"

  ".W": "We measured local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (ICMRGIc) using positron emission tomography (PET) in six children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and in six neurologically asymptomatic children with facial capillary hemangioma suggestive of SWS. Children with advanced SWS showed markedly depressed ICMRGIc in the anatomically affected cerebral hemisphere in a distribution that extended beyond the abnormalities depicted on computed tomography scan. In two infants with SWS and recent seizure onset, interictal PET revealed a paradoxical pattern of increased ICMRGIc in the cerebral cortex of the anatomically affected hemisphere. In one of these infants, ICMRGIc was also increased in the contralateral cerebellum, suggesting activation of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar circuitry. Subsequent PET (28 months later) in this child revealed the typical ICMRGIc pattern seen in advanced SWS. Further study of this transient ICMRGIc increase may be important in disclosing the pathogenesis of unilateral cerebral degeneration in SWS. In neurologically asymptomatic children with the facial stigmata of SWS and in children with early SWS, PET provides a sensitive measure of the extent and degree of cerebral metabolic impairment. Serial PET studies in children with SWS can be used to assess disease progression and, together with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be useful in the selection of suitable candidates for cerebral hemispherectomy or focal cortical resection.\r"

Six pregnancy-associated deaths due to AIDS in this country have been reported in the medical literature. We identified 20 unpublished cases of women who died of AIDS during or within one year after termination of pregnancy. Analysis showed that these women were mostly black or Hispanic, half were intravenous drug abusers, and most died of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Each pregnancy had an obstetric complication, primarily preterm delivery. The interval between diagnosis of AIDS and the death of these women ranged from one day to 15 months, with a mean interval of 113 days. Multiple reporting sources increased case detection and should be used for future investigations. Prospective case-control studies are needed to determine any further relationship between pregnancy complications and AIDS.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to four groups of 25 each as follows: group I, retransfusion of oxygenator blood after termination of extracorporeal circulation; group II, processing of oxygenator content by means of a cell separator; group III, predonation of autologous blood and isovolumetric substitution of hydroxyethyl starch (10 ml/kg bodyweight) after the induction of anesthesia in addition to the use of a cell separator; and group IV, predonation and the use of a cell separator plus postoperative retransfusion of shed mediastinal blood. To form homologous groups, we accepted only male patients without impairment of left ventricular function for the study. In addition, patients with internal mammary artery grafts and a duration of extracorporeal circulation less than 45 minutes or more than 90 minutes were excluded. The bank blood requirement during hospitalization was 2132 +/- 824 ml in group I, 1371 +/- 928 ml in group II, 833 +/- 599 ml in group III, and 408 +/- 559 ml in group IV. The use of blood conservation techniques resulted in reductions of homologous blood requirements of 34%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, in groups II to IV as compared with the requirement in group I. There were no complications related to autologous blood transfusion. We conclude that the use of blood conservation techniques can considerably reduce the homologous blood requirement in cardiac operations and therefore decrease transfusion-related risks.\r"

There was no evidence that endoscopic sclerotherapy directly increased the prevalence of anorectal varices. Haemorrhoids occurred independently of anorectal varices and their presence was unrelated to the degree of portal hypertension. These data provide further evidence that haemorrhoids and anorectal varices are separate and distinct entities. However, both can bleed and careful examination is essential to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.\r"

In addition, autoantibody-producing cells can be found in normal mice and their formation is enhanced by B-cell mitogens such as lipopolysaccharides. We have studied B-cell tolerance in transgenic mice using genes for IgM anti-H-2k MHC class I antibody. In H-2d transgenic mice about 25-50% of the splenic B cells bear membrane immunoglobulin of this specificity, and abundant serum IgM encoded by the transgenes is produced. In contrast, H-2k x H-2d (H-2-d/k) transgenic mice lack B cells bearing the anti-H-2k idiotype and contain no detectable serum anti-H-2k antibody, suggesting that very large numbers of autospecific B cells can be controlled by clonal deletion.\r"

  ".U": "89127526\r", 
  ".W": "The recent demonstrations that thrombolytic therapy with plasminogen activators can result in substantial reductions in mortality from coronary thrombosis have generated considerable interest in the properties of fibrinolytic enzymes. Examination of the primary sequence of these proteins (which include tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen, and urokinase) reveals that each is composed of a mosaic of domains which appear to be spatially distinct and connected by short peptide linkers. There is, however, little experimental information about the three-dimensional structure of any of the proteins, although several X-ray diffraction and NMR studies of isolated domains have been reported. Here we report two-dimensional NMR spectra of intact urokinase which are remarkably well resolved for a protein of this molecular weight. This effect is a consequence of substantial independent motion between individual domains of the protein, which overcomes the broadening effects anticipated for the slow overall tumbling rate of the intact molecule. As well as having significance for the physiological role of the protein, these results provide a direct means for the comparison of structural features determined for the isolated domains with those of the intact protein and may provide a basis for proposing or evaluating models for the overall structure of fibrinolytic proteins. Preliminary results with other proteins indicate that this approach may be generally applicable to other multidomain proteins of the fibrinolytic family.\r"

Nine reported prior prolonged episodes of vertigo consistent with the diagnosis of bilateral sequential vestibular neuritis. Of the remaining 13, none had exposure to known ototoxins or a positive family history. Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is an important cause of progressive imbalance in adults and should be considered even though hearing is normal.\r"

Cervical HSV shedding concomitant with HSV culture-positive vulvar lesions did not change significantly with advancing gestation. The presence of an HSV culture-positive vulvar lesion indicated a significantly (P less than .001) greater risk of concomitant cervical HSV shedding (44 of 333, 13.2%) than in pregnant women with HSV culture-positive remote lesions (zero of 60) or in asymptomatic women (27 of 1460, 1.9%). Comparison of the characteristics among 43 pairs of pregnancies in 34 women revealed no consistent change over time. This study of the natural history of genital HSV recurrences in pregnant women demonstrated no proclivity for an increased rate of preterm delivery (1.3%) or congenital anomalies (2.2%) in a predominantly white, non-Hispanic middle-class population.\r"

The frequency of positive antinuclear antibody tests at a titer of 1:40 or higher was 16.3% in cases, 16.6% in pregnant controls, and 16.8% in nonpregnant controls. Increasing the critical titer to 1:80, however, led to a statistically significant difference between cases (6.9%) and controls (0 and 0.8%, pregnant and nonpregnant, respectively; P less than .0001). Additional serologic tests failed to identify any subclinical autoimmune diseases, although two antinuclear antibody-negative patients later developed systemic lupus erythematosus. Pregnancy outcome in women with antinuclear antibody titers of 1:80 or higher included 52% live births, compared with 65.6% live births in women with three or more pregnancy losses and an entirely normal comprehensive evaluation, a nonsignificant difference. The combination of clinical evaluation and antinuclear antibody tests did not identify new cases of autoimmune disease in this population.\r"

  ".U": "89128840\r", 
  ".W": "A small percentage (approximately 5%) of the cells in the adult thymus expresses a heterodimeric receptor, gamma delta, that exhibits extensive clonal diversity. The specificity and function of these cells are unclear. Furthermore, it is not known if their role in the immune system is primarily one that operates within the thymus during the selection of the T-cell repertoire or if they function primarily in an antigen-recognition capacity in the peripheral lymphoid system. To examine if gamma delta+ T cells in the periphery are as diverse as those in the thymus, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify delta-chain transcripts from polyclonal populations of thymic and splenic lymphocytes (the latter were derived from allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures). The nucleotide sequences of delta chains from the spleen, like those from the thymus, were all different. Most of the diversity was present in the region between the variable (V) and joining (J) gene segments and was generated through the use of the two known diversity (D) elements, D delta 1 and D delta 2, and by the addition or deletion of bases at the V delta D delta 1, D delta 1D delta 2, and D delta 2J delta junctions. The extensive gamma delta repertoire among peripheral cells suggests that they have the potential to recognize an array of ligands that could be as diverse as those recognized by alpha beta+ cells. The amplification strategy described here can be used to analyze rapidly the diversity exhibited by any of the members of the immunoglobulin-like gene families that undergo rearrangement.\r"

We analyzed the amino acid substitutions that lead to the structural differences distinguishing DQ3.2 beta from its nondiabetogenic, but closely related allele, DQ3.1 beta. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DQ3.2 beta gene was used to convert key nucleotides into DQ3.1 beta codons. Subsequent expression studies of these mutated DQ3.2 beta clones using retroviral vectors defined amino acid 45 as critical for generating serologic epitopes characterizing the DQw3.1 beta and DQw3.2 beta molecules.\r"

  ".U": "89128842\r", 
  ".W": "A major role that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play in the immune response is the specific destruction of viral-infected cells and tissue from foreign grafts. Class I molecules encoded within the major histocompatibility complex are the target structures for these CTLs. Recently, viral-restricted CTLs have been shown to recognize viral peptides in association with class I molecules, while several studies with cloned alloreactive CTLs have indicated that these T cells can recognize class I-derived peptides in association with class I molecules. Together, these observations suggest that peptide binding is an important function of class I molecules. In this paper, we show that the recognition of a particular class I molecule by a bulk population of alloreactive CTLs can be altered by incubating with it a peptide derived from another class I molecule. Specifically, we used the hybrid D/Ldm1 molecule as a target structure together with the peptide Ld61-85, and we have shown that their associative recognition by Ld-specific CTLs depends on sequence and configuration of the peptide and is specific for Ld using a cold-target inhibition assay. Our results are discussed in light of three possible models for the target structure(s) that can be recognized by alloreactive CTLs and in terms of the role peptides may play during allorecognition.\r"

  ".U": "89128853\r", 
  ".W": "While many theories of general anesthesia postulate a lipid site of action, there has been no adequate explanation for the lack of anesthetic potency of the highly hydrophobic primary alkanols with more than 12 carbons (the cut-off). Some work suggests that these nonanesthetic alcohols do not dissolve in membranes. Other work contradicts this and suggests that an anesthetic site on a protein provides a better explanation. Here we show that both the anesthetic dodecanol and the nonanesthetic tetradecanol are taken up equally well into the tissues of animals and into isolated postsynaptic membranes. When a group of Rana pipiens tadpoles were treated with dodecanol, half were anesthetized by 4.7 microM (free aqueos concentration), and the corresponding concentration in the tissues was found to be 0.4 mmol per kg wet weight. Prolonged exposure (92 hr) to tetradecanol produced even higher tissue concentrations (0.7 mmol per kg wet weight), yet no anesthetic effects were observed. Furthermore, general anesthetics are thought to act on postsynaptic membranes but both alkanols partitioned into postsynaptic membranes from Torpedo electroplaques. The spin label, 12-doxyl stearate, was incorporated into these membranes. The lipid order parameter it reported was decreased by the anesthetic alcohols (octanol, decanol, and dodecanol), whereas the nonanesthetic alcohols either did not change it significantly (tetradecanol) or actually increased it (hexadecanol and octadecanol). Thus, although lipid solubility is unable to account for the pharmacology of the cut-off in potency of the long-chain alcohols, lipid perturbations provide an accurate description.\r"

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) occurred significantly more often with heterogeneous diffuse uptake than with homogeneous diffuse uptake. Heterogeneous diffuse uptake had an 87% positive predictive value for PCP, which was higher than that of other patterns. Localized pulmonary uptake was most commonly due to bacterial pneumonia or PCP; ill-defined, perihilar uptake, to cytomegalovirus or PCP; and focal (lymph node) uptake, to tuberculosis or lymphoma. The positive predictive value of any pulmonary uptake for lung pathology was 93%, and the negative predictive value of a negative scan was 96%. These findings confirm the utility of gallium scanning in the detection of lung pathology related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, particularly PCP. Furthermore, identification of a diffuse pattern may permit the use of a less invasive test more specifically directed at the confirmation of a diagnosis of PCP.\r"

Fifty-six abnormalities were identified as possible sources of the fever; 27 were confirmed with biopsy. Of these 27, 15 were identified only on In-111 WBC scans (including colitis, sinusitis, and focal bacterial pneumonia); six, only on Ga-67 scans (predominantly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and lymphadenopathy); and six, on both studies (predominantly pulmonary lesions). In-111 WBC scanning revealed 21 of 27 abnormalities (78%) and gallium scanning, 12 of 27 (44%). If only one scintigraphic study has been performed, particularly with Ga-67, a significant number of lesions would not have been detected. The authors believe radionuclide evaluation of the febrile AIDS patient without localizing signs should begin with In-111 WBC scintigraphy. Gallium scanning may be used depending on results of In-111 WBC scans or if there is a high index of suspicion for P carinii pneumonia.\r"

Initial empiric therapy after alligator bites should be directed at gram-negative species, in particular, Aeromonas hydrophila and anaerobic species including Clostridium. Of the numerous fungi that were isolated, none has been reported to result in wound infection after alligator bites.\r"

Esophageal mucosal slough, which was diagnosed by endoscopy, occurred on 250 occasions in 126 patients but did not require specific treatment. An injection site leak occurred in 25 patients, was managed conservatively, and was associated with a mortality rate of 28%. Stenosis of the esophagus was found in 32 patients, but only five patients required dilatation for relief of symptoms. Rupture of the esophagus occurred in four patients, three of whom had surgical treatment, and was associated with a mortality rate of 50%. Serious complications were more frequent with the rigid esophagoscope. An injection site leak occurred more frequently after acute sclerotherapy via the rigid esophagoscope. All four patients with rupture of the esophagus were injected electively via the rigid esophagoscope. Although the incidence of serious complications after injection sclerotherapy in this series appears acceptable, complications have been noted to be cumulative with time.\r"

The central pulmonary vasculature was imaged by using a cine-limited-flip-angle (cine-MR) pulse sequence with 63/13 (TR/TE) and a 30 degrees flip angle (theta), as well as standard spin-echo sequences. Patients were selected on the basis of suspicion of central pulmonary embolism and correlative studies done within 24 hr of the MR examination. Correlations with other studies were based on the original MR report and blinded review of the MR images by two observers in consensus. Emboli were shown in all cases by cine-MR, and they corresponded to the locations of angiographic abnormalities and mismatched perfusion defects on scintigraphy. In three patients considered to have acute pulmonary embolus on the basis of angiography, the cine-MR studies were consistent with acute pulmonary embolus in two patients and chronic pulmonary embolus in one patient (however, in that patient pathologic examination showed chronic embolism). In one case in which angiography led to the diagnosis of acute and chronic pulmonary embolism, the cine-MR study showed acute embolism. In three patients thought to have chronic pulmonary embolus on the basis of angiography, the cine-MR study was interpreted as representing acute embolus in one patient and chronic embolus in two patients. In this highly selected, small group of patients, cine-MR imaging was accurate in showing central pulmonary embolism.\r"

Sixty-one patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of cardiac masses were imaged with ECG-gated MR at 1.5 T (22 patients) or 0.15 T (39 patients). Fifty-one patients had echocardiography previously. Among the tissue diagnoses were myxoma (six); fibroma, rhabdomyoma, plasma cell granuloma, lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum, mesothelioma, and thymoma (two each); and leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoid, melanoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, hemangiopericytoma, and lung spindle cell sarcoma (one each). MR imaging demonstrated masses in 50 patients (82%); they were centered in the heart in 32, pericardial in nine, and juxtacardiac in nine. MR imaging provided diagnostic information that affected clinical management or surgical planning in 53 patients (87%), including 11 (18%) in whom cardiac mass was excluded by MR. The ability to provide a global view of cardiac anatomy and other unique capabilities of MR imaging give the procedure an important role in the diagnosis and preoperative assessment of cardiac masses.\r"

No difference was seen in the graininess of the films. In our study, the conventional system was consistently found to be slightly better than the dual-screen, dual-emulsion combination. The dual-emulsion mammograms required more careful scrutiny, particularly for detection of faint microcalcifications.\r"

CT was used as the reference standard to determine the ability of MR to delineate normal and abnormal pancreatic anatomy and thereby to exclude or detect pancreatic malignancy. Short TR/short TE spin-echo sequences were significantly better (p less than .05) than inversion recovery or T2-weighted spin-echo sequences in resolution of both normal and abnormal anatomy. Resolution of pancreatic anatomy correlated (r = .9) with the image signal-to-noise ratio. In seven (22%) of 32 cases, MR visualized pancreatic tumors better than CT did because it showed a signal intensity difference between the tumor and normal pancreatic tissue. Overall, the slight superiority of MR over CT for tumor visualization tended to occur in larger tumors and was not statistically significant. On T1-weighted images, 63% (20 of 32) of pancreatic tumors studied had lower signal intensities than normal pancreatic tissue, whereas on T2-weighted sequences (TE = 60, 120, and 180 msec) only 41% (13 of 32) of tumors had increased signal intensities. Currently available MR imaging techniques offer no significant advantages over CT for evaluating the pancreas for neoplasia.\r"

The difference between mean tumor-to-liver signal ratio on FLASH imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (1.46 +/- 1.06) and hemangioma (0.86 +/- 0.45) was statistically significant (p less than .01). Fifty-one (82%) of 62 lesions were classified correctly when the borderline of tumor-to-liver signal ratio between hepatoma and hemangioma was set at 0.9. The mean T2 values of hepatomas and hemangiomas were 48 +/- 10 msec and 89 +/- 20 msec, respectively. Fifty-seven (92%) of 62 lesions were correctly diagnosed with the T2 borderline of 80 msec. The five misdiagnosed lesions with the T2 borderline were hemangiomas smaller than 2 cm with tumor-to-liver signal ratios less than 0.9. FLASH images appear promising for differentiating between hepatoma and hemangioma, and they complement T2 values in characterizing small lesions.\r"

We collected 18 cases, all with proved colonic neoplasm 2-8 cm in diameter that were detected by barium enema but overlooked on initial endoscopy. All of the lesions were relatively flat with little intraluminal protuberance. Histologic examination showed malignant foci in six of 11 tumors that were resected. In two of the other seven patients, unresected lesions progressed to advanced carcinomas.

The conventional and digitized images were evaluated by six radiologists giving their decision confidence on a graded scale. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed from these data to compare the digital images with the conventional films. The results show significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy as pixel size decreases to the level of 0.08 mm. Digital images with pixel sizes of 0.04 mm (11.4 Ip/mm) were not significantly different from the magnification radiographs in terms of observer performance. In conclusion, for high-resolution skeletal imaging as needed for detection of subperiosteal resorption, spatial resolution of 5.7 Ip/mm or less resulted in a significant loss of diagnostic accuracy, as compared with conventional films.\r"

Seven patients had underlying systemic disease, including sickle cell disease (two), systemic lupus erythematosus (two), acute lymphocytic leukemia (one), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one), and renal transplantation (one). In one patient, the bone infarct was idiopathic. Plain films in three of the eight cases were misinterpreted as showing aggressive lesions (i.e., malignancy or infection), and these patients underwent a biopsy that proved the diagnosis of bone infarction. In the other five cases, the diagnoses were established by clinical follow-up. The plain film findings in all eight cases consisted of subtle, mottled, ill-defined radiolucencies in the diametaphyseal region. Four of the patients had mild sclerosis. MR imaging in all four cases in which it was performed showed a central area with high or intermediate signal with a serpentine, thin, low-signal border. The lesions shown by MR imaging corresponded to the areas of abnormality on the plain films and had an appearance similar to that of previously reported bone infarcts. Our experience suggests that in patients with nonspecific subtle radiographic bone changes and an underlying systemic disease, MR imaging is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of bone marrow infarction.\r"

Various clinical indications for imaging each patient with routine radiography, tomography, and surface-coil MR included headache, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and/or ilsilateral facial pain, joint crepitus, clicking, locking, and either recently acquired or changing (unstable) occlusal disorder. Radiologic findings included alterations in condyle morphology and MR signal characteristics compatible with either OCD or AVN or, in some cases, both. Previous nonsurgical mandibular trauma was temporally related to the onset of symptoms in eight patients. Five patients exhibiting either unilateral or bilateral AVN involving the condyles and condylar necks had undergone previous orthognathic surgery, including sagittal split mandibular osteotomies followed by intermaxillary fixation. One patient exhibiting condylar AVN with articular surface collapse and osseous destruction had undergone previous TMJ meniscectomy followed by insertion of a permanent Proplast implant. Thirty-one of 34 patients with no prior surgery and MR changes of condylar OCD/AVN had associated internal derangement of the TMJ meniscus. There was surgical confirmation of findings in 10 joints. We assert that OCD and AVN are relatively common, clinically significant lesions of the mandibular condyle often associated with preexisting internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.\r"

Periodontoid pannus formation was revealed by MR preoperatively in nine patients, all with mobile horizontal atlantoaxial subluxation. Compression of the medulla and/or upper cervical cord, due to subluxation and periodontoid pannus bulging into the spinal canal, was seen in seven patients. After the stabilizing surgery the periodontoid pannus had decreased in size in all patients with preoperative pannus. This reduction in the pannus seems to be the result of the atlantoaxial immobility achieved by the posterior fusion. Postoperatively, three patients had some remaining compression of the medulla and/or cord secondary to immobile subluxation, while the pannus posterior to the odontoid process had disappeared. Artifacts from the surgical stainless steel fixation material were confined to the posterior part of the neck on short TR/short TE MR images and did not interfere with the evaluation of the periodontoid region and the anterior part of the medulla/cervical cord. We found that flexion and extension lateral radiographs, combined with sagittal short TR/short TE MR images in the neutral position, enable preoperative evaluation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the cervical spine. Postoperative MR should be performed only if there are residual or new symptoms.\r"

Seven hundred ninety-five radiographs were evaluated in 126 patients over a 10-week period. Eighty-one percent of all radiographs showed one or more cardiopulmonary abnormalities, and 25% of routine radiographs had findings that altered management of patients. Nineteen percent of radiographs, including 17% of routine radiographs, showed a malpositioned tube or catheter. Thirty-five percent of endotracheal tubes shown on postintubation radiographs and 41% of central venous catheters shown on post-catheter placement radiographs were malpositioned. Forty-five percent of radiographs with a previous reading showed a significant interval change. Radiographs in patients 1 year old or younger showed more cardiopulmonary abnormalities (p less than .04), tube or catheter malpositions (p less than .03), and significant interval changes (p less than .03), and they elicited more changes in clinical management (p less than .01) than did radiographs in patients over 1 year old. The frequency of management changes dictated by radiographs increased with increasing amounts of respiratory support (p less than .01). Our data indicate that bedside radiography in the pediatric intensive-care setting has a high efficacy and clinical utility.\r"

The more precise delineation of white and gray matter on inversion-recovery images as compared with CT allows a detailed demonstration of the anatomic features of periventricular leukomalacia; specifically, a reduced quantity of white matter in the periventricular region and centrum semiovale and, in more severe cases, cavitated infarcts that replace the immediate periventricular white matter. The T2-weighted spin-echo and short inversion time inversion-recovery images demonstrated abnormally increased signal in white matter that appeared normal on CT scans and only minimally abnormal on conventional inversion-recovery images. These abnormalities most probably represent white matter gliosis that extends beyond the immediate periventricular regions. MR recognition of cerebral white matter abnormalities associated with periventricular leukomalacia may confirm the clinical suspicion of this diagnosis in children with spastic diplegia or quadriplegia.\r"

  ".W": "Intrasellar herniation of the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract (suprasellar visual system, SVS), and anteroinferior third ventricle can occur into primary or secondary empty sellae. The anatomic part of this study evaluated the appearance of the SVS in subjects with normal sellae (n = 52), the patterns and prevalence of SVS herniation in enlarged primary empty sellae (n = 24), and the patterns of intrasellar herniation of the SVS in secondary empty sellae (n = 8). The clinical part of this study was to correlate the visual status with the anatomic patterns of the intrasellar herniated SVS. High-resolution MR and CT were used to define the anatomy. MR was superior to CT in all groups in defining accurately the SVS relationship to the sella turcica. In the normal group, the SVS invariably had a straight-line appearance formed by the optic nerve, optic chiasm, and floor of the third ventricle and was above the sella. The SVS was herniated in three of 24 enlarged primary empty sellae. A difference in the appearance of the hypothalamic and infundibular recesses in the primary empty sella group with SVS herniation (dilated recesses and formation of an obtuse angle) and in the secondary empty sella group with SVS herniation (nondilated recesses and formation of an acute angle) was observed. Visual disturbances in primary empty sellae with SVS herniation were present in two of three subjects. Visual disturbances may be absent or minimal in primary empty sellae and secondary empty sellae with herniation of the SVS. Progression of the symptoms--visual field defects, optic atrophy, and loss of vision--is not inevitable. There was no correlation between the severity of visual symptoms and the degree of herniation of the SVS in either the primary or secondary sellae. We found that intrasellar herniation of the SVS into a primary or secondary empty sella is well delineated with MR, and MR should facilitate decisions concerning surgery or therapy. Visual disturbances proved to be an unreliable indicator of herniation.\r"

Multiplanar MR imaging provided accurate localization of the anterosuperior third-ventricle mass in all cases. The MR intensity characteristics of the colloid cysts varied and the astrocytoma could not be differentiated from the colloid cysts on MR. The astrocytoma contained a calcification that was clearly demonstrated on CT but was difficult to appreciate on MR. Neither MR nor CT was useful in predicting success of stereotactic aspiration of the colloid cysts in this small series, but the presence of thin, low-viscosity cyst contents could be suggested by both examinations.\r"

MR demonstrated convexity and interhemispheric collections, which were mildly hyperintense relative to CSF and hypointense relative to white matter on short TR pulse sequences and hyperintense relative to CSF and white matter on long TR pulse sequences, allowing distinction from sterile effusions and most chronic hematomas. A hypointense rim, representing displaced dura, was depicted at the interface between the lesion and brain in epidural empyemas, a feature absent in subdural empyemas. Inflammation-induced parenchymal abnormalities, including edema, mass effect, and reversible cortical hyperintensity, were well depicted on MR imaging. MR was superior to CT in demonstrating the presence, nature, and extent of these lesions in all cases. Because early and accurate diagnosis will significantly improve the prognosis of these serious infections, MR is preferred to CT for patients in whom an acute intracranial infection is suspected.\r"

Five of six patients with arteriovenous fistula had simultaneous catheterization of both the femoral artery and the femoral vein. Although we did not determine the location of arterial puncture used in uncomplicated angiograms during the 5-year study period, our experience in 11 patients with pseudoaneurysms with or without arteriovenous fistula suggests that there is an association between a puncture site below the level of the femoral head and arterial injury. In addition, arteriovenous fistulas appear to be associated with simultaneous catheterization of the femoral artery and adjacent femoral vein.\r"

Several studies have shown a significant rate of subclavian vein stenosis or occlusion after placement of these catheters. A large number of these patients require repeat placement of catheters with access often becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Over the past 5 years, we have been asked to place 38 catheters in 34 patients that could not be placed at the bedside. Our procedure consists of obtaining a preliminary venogram to evaluate the reason for difficulty. The subclavian vein is then cannulated under direct fluoroscopic visualization while the peripheral venous line is injected with contrast material. Percutaneous angiographic techniques are then used to position the catheter. Satisfactory placement was obtained in all 38 cases. There were no complications, which is surprising considering the number of complications seen with the standard methods of insertion. This represents a new role for the interventional radiologist, one that can be important in minimizing the number of new dialysis sites in any one patient.\r"

Molecular genetic analysis of the T-cell receptor beta-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were also applied to cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD)-like lymphoma and so-called Lennert's lymphoma. Twenty non-ATL lymphomas expressed a helper/inducer phenotype, whereas only one extranodal case expressed a suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype. Three cases had a CD4-CD8- phenotype, and two cases a CD4+CD8+phenotype. No specific relationship between morphologic characteristics (LSG classification) and phenotype was found among non-ATL lymphomas. Six of eight AILD-like lymphomas had a helper/inducer phenotype. Monoclonality of neoplastic T-cells was demonstrated in six of the seven cases of AILD-like lymphoma by molecular genetic analysis. Two cases of Lennert's lymphoma also showed a helper/inducer phenotype and rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene. Serologically defined ATL cases had a helper/inducer phenotype except in one case that expressed both CD4 and CD8. None of the ATL cases had the CD7 antigen in this study using WT 1 as a CD7 antibody, which is in contrast with the non-ATL lymphomas in which 13 of 25 cases expressed CD7. CD25, strongly detectable in all ATL cases, was negative or weakly expressed in non-ATL lymphomas. These facts suggest that non-ATL and ATL are in the different biologic state, probably resulting from the integration of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), although both are derived from helper/inducer T-cells.\r"

Histologic findings included surface ulcerations and associated inflammation of the lamina propria and submucosa, marked by substantial eosinophilic infiltration. Both clinical symptoms and colonoscopic abnormalities rapidly resolved in all patients after the elimination of cow's milk and/or soy protein from the diet. These data indicate that hematochezia may be the predominant symptom of cow's milk protein and soy protein intolerance in many affected infants, and that colonoscopy is the most effective means of establishing a definitive diagnosis in this patient population.\r"

The mechanism by which bleomycin promotes this increase in MDGF secretion is not clear, however. The purpose of this study was to determine the direct effects of bleomycin on alveolar macrophages. Normal rat alveolar macrophages obtained by lavage were cultured in the presence or absence of bleomycin; conditioned media from these cultures were dialyzed to remove bleomycin and then assayed in vitro for MDGF activity. Alveolar macrophages incubated with 0.01 microgram to 1 microgram/ml bleomycin for 18 hours secreted significantly more MDGF than macrophages incubated without bleomycin. Viability of macrophages as determined by exclusion of trypan blue and release of LDH was unaffected by any dose tested. Maximal MDGF production was seen with bleomycin doses of greater than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml. When alveolar macrophages were incubated with 0.1 microgram/ml bleomycin for 0.5-18 hours, MDGF activity was detected as early as 1 hour, with peak responses found at 4-8 hours. Macrophages stimulated with bleomycin continued to produce significant amounts of MDGF even after bleomycin was removed and replaced with fresh (bleomycin-free) media. MDGF secretion by bleomycin-stimulated alveolar macrophages was inhibited by cycloheximide, and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors NDGA (nordihydroguairetic acid) and BW755c, indicating not only a requirement for protein synthesis but also for metabolites of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism for full expression of activity(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Injection of antibodies to renal tubular membrane (Fx1A) into Lewis rats induces granular deposits of IgG in glomeruli and proteinuria (passive Heymann nephritis, PHN), and similar lesions are also induced by antibody to one of the antigens in Fx1A, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV, gp 108). In this study, the role of DPP IV in PHN was investigated using DPP IV-deficient F344 rats. The amount of DPP IV found in F344 rat kidneys was less than 0.05% of that present in Wistar rats, and injection of anti-DPP IV antibody into F344 rats did not induce proteinuria. Injection of anti-F344 Fx1A rabbit antibodies that contain no detectable anti-DPP IV antibody into Lewis or F344 rats induced PHN, characterized by granular deposits of rabbit IgG in glomeruli and massive proteinuria, although the appearance of proteinuria was delayed in comparison with that occurring in response to injection of anti-Wistar Fx1A antibodies. These results indicate that DPP IV may contribute to, but is not essential for, the induction of PHN.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage infiltration is important in the pathogenesis of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (gn). The state of activation of macrophages during gn may be central to their role in injury. To study this, a method for extracting macrophages from nephritic glomeruli in active in situ gn was developed. MHC Class II (Ia) antigen expression, superoxide (O2-) generation, and eicosanoid synthesis were compared with thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages (TEM). At the height of inflammation there were 407 +/- 83 macrophages/glomerulus. Compared with TEM, Ia expression, and in vitro production of O2- were enhanced. Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 was greatly reduced (day 6 gn, 62 +/- 10 ng/mg; TEM 663 +/- 128 ng/mg cell protein). Thromboxane synthesis was relatively conserved (day 6 gn, 109 +/- 28 ng/mg; TEM 201 +/- 53 ng/mg). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was undetectable (day 6 gn, less than 13 ng/mg; TEM 119 +/- 56 ng/mg). This large influx of activated macrophages in glomeruli may be fundamental to pathogenesis of glomerular inflammation.\r"

The histologic findings subdivided according to a four-stage classification were correlated significantly with immediate survival. Specifically, 21 of 23 stage IV patients with severe degenerative and necrotic parenchymal lesions died after immediate emergency surgery, whereas 26 of 48 stage IV patients who did not undergo emergency surgery survived. Stage IV patients appeared unable to withstand major surgery. According to our data, histologic stage and Child's class are independent parameters, especially in emergency situations, since they quantify different aspects of functional liver failure. Therapeutic implications are presented based on cumulative analysis of histologic stages and Child's classes.\r"

  ".W": "Primary mitral leaflet billowing, or so-called mitral valve prolapse, has become the most common valve anomaly in the United States and is also frequently found throughout the world. Its prevalence varies from less than 1% to 38%, differing not only between countries but also within the same country. The prevalence depends on whether the study is clinical or echocardiographic, based on autopsy or surgical material, or of hospital or non-care-seeking population. Other explanations for the varying prevalence are the age, sex and weight differences of the study population, imprecise terminology, the care with which auscultation and/or echocardiography are carried out and interpreted, and some selection biases. Although prevalent throughout the world, the condition is generally benign and can often be regarded as a normal variant. Among the complications of mitral valve prolapse, progressive mitral regurgitation and infective endocarditis are particularly noteworthy. Primary mitral valve prolapse is currently a leading cause of mitral regurgitation and also of infective endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the opinions of patients and physicians regarding physician dress and demeanor in the emergency department, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 190 ED patients and 129 medical specialists, family practitioners, surgeons, and emergency physicians in a community hospital. Seventy-three percent of physicians and 43% of patients thought that physical appearance influenced patient opinion of medical care. Forty-nine percent of patients believed emergency physicians should wear white coats, but only 18% disliked scrub suits. Patients were more tolerant of casual dress than were physicians. Both groups disliked excessive jewelry, prominent ruffles or ribbons, long fingernails, blue jeans, and sandals. Opinions and practices of emergency physicians were similar to those of other medical specialists. Most physicians (96%) addressed patients by surname or title, but 43% of patients preferred being called by their first names. The age, gender, income, and education of patients did not influence how they wished to be addressed. Larger studies are needed to assess the influence of age, sex, race, and depth of feeling regarding first-name address and physician attire in the ED.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the morbidity and mortality of cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass surgery in patients on chronic hemodialysis. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixteen consecutive patients on chronic hemodialysis who had catheterization and bypass surgery: 30 controls matched for age, sex, year of operation, severity of coronary disease, left ventricular function, hypertension, diabetes, and urgency of surgery: and 34 consecutive controls having bypass surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No major complications of catheterization occurred. Of 16 patients on dialysis, 7 had urgent surgery within 24 hours of catheterization. One patient on dialysis and 3 consecutive controls died, but none of the matched controls died. Postoperative morbidity was increased in the hemodialysis group as measured by the duration of mechanical ventilation (4.7 +/- 2.3 compared with 1.5 +/- 0.8 days in matched controls [mean +/- SE]), the duration of hemodynamic support (4.2 +/- 2.3 compared with 0.8 +/- 0.2 days), the length of stay in the intensive care unit (6.4 +/- 2.4 compared with 2.8 +/- 0.9 days), and the length of postoperative stay in the hospital (15.4 +/- 2.1 compared with 10.8 +/- 1.1 days) (all P less than 0.05). Four intraoperative myocardial infarctions occurred in patients on dialysis compared with two patients in the case-matched controls. Differences in morbidity between the two control groups were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity is increased in patients on hemodialysis having coronary artery bypass surgery compared with controls matched for severity of coronary disease; however, the outcome in all but one patient on dialysis was good. Bypass surgery is an acceptable treatment for patients on dialysis with advanced coronary artery disease. Because urgent surgery is often needed in these patients, earlier evaluation of the need for revascularization may improve clinical results.\r"

Recurrent laryngeal nerve section, botulinum toxin injection into the vocalis-thyroarytenoid muscle complex, and other techniques have been used to treat this disorder. We have used percutaneous electrical stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve with good results. Previous dog studies demonstrated the relative safety of an implantable recurrent laryngeal nerve stimulator. In this study, we directly stimulated the recurrent laryngeal nerve and vagus nerve in a dog without change in cardiorespiratory status. A Medtronic peripheral nerve stimulator was implanted in a patient with abductor spastic dysphonia. The cuff electrode was positioned around the recurrent laryngeal nerve and stimulation resulted in improvement in her voice. Extensive cardiopulmonary monitoring did not reveal any adverse response to stimulation and there was no discomfort to the patient. On the basis of the good results of this preliminary study, further study with long-term follow-up is under way.\r"

Patients were transfused an average of six units of packed red blood cells within 24 hours of admission. The bleeding source was localized arteriographically in 27 (40%), with a sensitivity of 65% among patients requiring emergency resection. However, twelve of the 41 patients with a negative arteriogram still required emergency intestinal resection for continued hemorrhage. Radionuclide bleeding scans had a sensitivity of 86%. The right colon was the most common site of bleeding (35%). Diverticulosis and arteriovenous malformation were the most common etiologies. Selective intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin and embolization were successful in 36% of cases in which they were employed and contributed to fatality in two patients. Twenty-three patients underwent segmental resection, whereas seven patients required subtotal colectomy for multiple bleeding sites or negative studies in the face continued hemorrhage. Intraoperative infusion of methylene blue via angiographic catheters allowed successful localization and resection of bleeding small bowel segments in three patients. Overall mortality was 21%. The mortality for patients without a malignancy, with a positive preoperative arteriogram, and emergency segmental resection was 13%.\r"

No adverse reactions occurred, with the exception of mild and transient hyperpyrexia for 48 hours during pamidronate administration. White blood cell counts did not change and serum interleukin 1 was undetectable before and after treatment with pamidronate. Pamidronate seems to be highly effective in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone, but its profound effects on mineral and bone metabolism require close monitoring during the short-term period of intravenous treatment.\r"
