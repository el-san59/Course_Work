It is possible that some, as yet unknown, factor increases the activity of the Na, K, 2Cl cotransporter and, hence, increases lithium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb in salt-depleted subjects. However, it is equally possible that a fraction of proximal tubular reabsorption is inhibited by frusemide and bumetanide. If this is correct, CLi in humans are reasonable markers of proximal tubular function even in conditions of avid salt retention and in salt depletion, when fractional reabsorption of salt and water in the proximal tubules is enhanced.\r"

  ".U": "90219907\r", 
  ".W": "Between January 1975 and December 1980, 111 patients with AJCC stages III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with surgery followed by planned postoperative radiation therapy. A previous analysis of a subgroup of these patients showed that, when radiation was delayed more than 6 weeks from surgery, a higher incidence of regional failure occurred compared with the incidence observed when therapy began within a 6 week period. We have looked back at this group of patients plus others in an attempt to determine whether other factors played a role in the results obtained. In the current study, 50 patients had a delay of 6 weeks or more and, of these, 11 (22%) suffered a locoregional recurrence. However, 8 of these 11 patients received suboptimal radiation doses (less than 56 Gy) for permanent control of the disease. In fact, of 17 patients who received at least 60 Gy and had more than a 6 week delay, only 2 (12%) had locoregional failure. This was similar to the incidence of failure in the patients who received at least 60 Gy and who started radiation within the first 6 weeks from surgery (3/20 [15%]). The effect of delay was apparent only in those who received less than 60 Gy (27% vs. 7%, P less than 0.05). Therefore, we cannot validate the previous conclusion that a greater than 6 week delay in the delivery of postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck cancers produces poorer results. The current analysis suggests that a prolonged delay in postoperative radiation therapy in itself does not have a negative impact on locoregional control as long as appropriate tumorcidal doses of more than 60 Gy are employed.\r"

The most common causes of abdominal operations were intestinal obstruction (N = 17), intraabdominal tumor mass (N = 8), and intraabdominal hemorrhage (N = 5). The overall postoperative mortality was 25%, morbidity 48%, median survival 3 months, and cumulative 5 year survival 3%. The mortality after emergency procedures, 67%, was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than after elective operations, 18%. Conditions requiring enterostomy (N = 14) were associated with a mortality of 36%, whereas the figures in resected (N = 13) and bypassed (N = 7) patients were 14% and 17%, respectively. Wound infection (N = 5) and pulmonary infection (N = 5) were the most common complications, and pulmonary infection was fatal in three of the five cases. Of the patients, 22 (55%) were discharged from hospital to their home; ten (25%) of them had postoperatively a 3 month relief of cancer symptoms and four (10%) a 6 month relief. Nine patients (25%) have survived for over 1 year and one (3%) for over 5 years. It is concluded that abdominal procedures seldom prevent further cancer growth within these patients and that symptoms are relieved only in one in every four patients. According to strict criteria, these operations are useful and can add to patient comfort.\r"

The distribution of laminin was classified into continuous and discontinuous staining patterns. The incidence of the discontinuous pattern was less in early-stage disease than that in advanced stages (P less than 0.01). In patients with stage I, the incidence of discontinuous patterns was greater in short-term survivors than in long-term survivors (P less than 0.05). By contrast, in patients with stage III, the discontinuous pattern of laminin was frequently seen in both long-term survivors and short-term survivors, with no difference between the two groups. These data suggest that the discontinuous pattern of laminin in tumor-associated basement membrane reflects the spread and dissemination of tumor, hence a close relationship to the prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "From August 1979 to May 1986, various brachytherapy techniques were applied at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in an adjuvant setting with/without surgery and external radiation therapy in the management of advanced malignant melanoma. Thirty-three patients underwent brachytherapy procedures. The patients' ages ranged from 35 to 82 years, with a median age of 56 years. Fourteen patients had disease localized to the implant site, whereas 19 patients also had disseminated disease elsewhere. The indications for implant were residual gross disease (21), microscopically positive margins (3), and histologically negative but clinically close margins of resection (9). Local control at the implant site was noted in 80% of patients at 6 months and 42% of patients at 1 year; two patients had reached 54 months and 72 months with no evidence of disease. Local control was 100% (9/9) in patients with histologically negative but clinically close margins of resection, and 48% (11/23) with microscopically positive margins and/or gross residual disease. Complications were seen as follows: delay in wound healing (1), wound infections (4), radiation enteritis (1), small bowel obstruction (1). The present study suggests that brachytherapy combined with surgery can achieve a good local control in patients with negative but clinically close margins of resection. In patients with gross residual disease who are at a high risk for local recurrence, approximately one-half can be locally controlled with this approach. These preliminary results should be tested in a prospective controlled study.\r"

Because of the reported association of breast cancer with bloody nipple discharge, close follow-up of these women at monthly intervals during pregnancy and trimonthly during the postpartum period was carried out. In all instances, the discharge appeared late during the second trimester or during the third trimester of pregnancy. It was unilateral and spontaneous and arose from multiple ducts, and it was associated with an increase in breast size and always with the larger breast of the two. The discharge cytologic study done on all cases was negative for neoplastic cells and the discharges resolved spontaneously within 2 months of onset. Postpartum follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years has revealed no evidence of neoplastic changes thus far. Mammograms ordered before these patients were referred were not helpful due to the increase in density of the breast tissue secondary to the pregnancy. Because a few cases of breast cancer during pregnancy have presented solely with a bloody nipple discharge, I recommend extremely close follow-up of these women and no surgical intervention unless a mass is discovered or the nipple discharge cytology is either suspicious or positive at the initial visit or during follow-up.\r"

Objective responses were achieved in 11 patients (37%), including three complete (10%) and eight partial (27%) tumor regressions. Successful debulking surgery was performed in seven of the eleven patients with response. Six remained free of regional disease after a median time of 25 months, and four are also free of distant metastases at 24+, 25+, 41+, and 54+ months. Nineteen of thirty patients with no significant tumor response underwent alternative treatments. Debulking surgery was performed in nine, but with little palliative gain, since seven relapsed at a median time of 5 months. Our results suggest that a combined therapeutic approach--preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery in responding tumors--represents an effective treatment for patients with regionally advanced melanoma.\r"

Complications included wound infection, pharyngocutaneous fistulae, flap necrosis, carotid blowout, and neo-esophageal stenosis. Postoperative deaths and delayed fatalities were also recorded. The overall fistulae rate was 34.7%, and wound infection occurred in 28% of patients. Prior radiotherapy and the need for pharyngeal reconstruction were found to be significant in determining postsurgical complications. Age, sex, site, stage, cartilage and soft tissue infiltration, preoperative tracheostomy, involvement of resection margins by tumor, and the dose of radiotherapy were not found to influence the complication rates.\r"

Four patients responded to interferon-alpha with clearance of HBeAg and permanent inhibition of HBV replication within 3-12 weeks; in each of these patients, the changes were accompanied by substantial rises in spontaneous in-vitro production of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from previously undetectable levels. There was little or no change in spontaneous TNF alpha and IL-1 beta production in the three patients who did not lose HBeAg in response to interferon-alpha. These findings suggest that TNF alpha and IL-1 beta may contribute to the permanent elimination during interferon-alpha treatment of hepatocytes supporting viral infection and that the therapeutic potential of these cytokines is worthy of investigation.\r"

Liver abnormalities in the former were chronic persistent hepatitis (32%), chronic active hepatitis (51%), and cirrhosis (17%). Actuarial patient survival was similar in HBsAg-positive (78%) and HBsAg-negative (87%) patients, as was allograft survival (64% and 71%, respectively). In both HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative patients chronic alcohol consumption was more frequent in those with chronic liver disease than those without.

It consists of 0.1 ml of purified Vero cell rabies vaccine containing more than 2.5 IU of rabies antigen per 0.5 ml of reconstituted vaccine given intradermally at two sites on days 0, 3, and 7, followed by one 0.1 ml injection on days 30 and 90. The commercial vaccine used had an antigen content of 3.17 IU per 0.5 ml ampoule. Purified equine or human rabies immuno-globulin was also given on day 0 to patients with severe exposures. As much of the immunoglobulin as possible was infiltrated around the wounds. All patients were followed for 1 year post exposure. There were no deaths; the efficacy of the regimen was 100%. Antibody titre determination in a randomly selected subgroup showed seroconversion in all 10 patients.\r"

To find out why the HBV carrier rate has fallen, changes in the modes of HBV infection were examined. The HBsAg positivity rate among mothers who gave birth to HBV carrier children in 1965 and before was 26.8% and that for such mothers whose babies were born in 1966 and after was 66.7%, whereas the HBsAg positivity rate among children born to HBV carrier mothers in 1965 and before and in 1966 and after were 30.8% and 28.3%, respectively. None of the 503 inhabitants who had no HBV markers in 1976 had become carriers by 1981. These findings indicate that the decrease in the prevalence of HBV carriage is caused mainly by the reduction in occurrence of horizontal transmission of HBV in infancy.\r"

Specificity and sensitivity of amplification were achieved by two sequential reactions with two sets of primers, amplifying first a 725 base-pair sequence and secondly a 680 base-pair sequence from within the first amplified fragment. A restriction enzyme digest of the DNA amplified from a single oocyte with the endonuclease Dde I confirmed the identity of the amplified beta-haemoglobin fragment; this technique provides a diagnostic test for the genetic defect responsible for sickle cell anaemia. Analysis of the DNA from the first polar body may enable detection of such defects in unfertilised eggs from carrier women. Selection of eggs without the defect for fertilisation may therefore obviate the need for diagnostic procedures on embryos.\r"

In 1986 hypereosinophilic syndrome, secondary to a T-cell lymphocytic lymphoma, developed in the father, then aged 45 years. A full haematological remission was obtained by means of standard acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment. He then received melphalan, total body irradiation, and a BMT from his son. Graft-versus-host disease was transient in both patients, and father and son remain well and disease-free 20 months and 10 years, respectively, after BMT.\r"

In two of these comparison of conduction in the SBRN to the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and contralateral SBRN was abnormal, whereas the absolute SBRN conduction appeared normal. Normal LACN-SBRN difference in the same arm was 1.9 +/- 1.6 m/sec, with a range of 0-7.0 m/sec; mean SBRN difference in opposite arms of the same subject was 1.8 +/- 1.6 m/sec.\r"

Recently, electrophysiological signs thought to be specific for each entity have been described and have been used to bolster the argument that the two disorders are distinct. We report a particularly instructive family wherein individual members had clinical features of either PC or HPP and electrophysiological features of both. We suggest that PC and HPP represent part of the spectrum of a single genetic disorder. Evoked response testing, with exercise and cold provocation, may be useful in determining the physiologic pattern that predominates in any one individual.\r"

Significant differences were observed in the pH and the concentrations of creatine kinase and Na+ before exercise between healthy volunteers and MyD patients. In comparison with healthy volunteers a lower pH and higher concentrations of both CK and Na+ were found in MyD patients. The concentrations of K+, inorganic phosphate, lactate, and ammonia increase upon exercise in all groups. The mean increase in plasma K+ for healthy volunteers amounted to 0.8 mM (= 23%). In MyD patients a significantly higher increase in plasma K+ was found [mean 2.2 mM (= 65%)]. No abnormal release of K+ from muscular tissue was found in the disease control groups. Data on the postexercise increase in the concentration of other muscular constituents such as creatine kinase, inorganic phosphate, or creatine exclude the possibility of a generally increased membrane permeability in MyD. The abnormally high increase of plasma K+ upon muscular exercise seems to be specific for MyD and may be related to the biochemical defect in this disease.\r"

Muscle computed tomography revealed that muscle enlargement in the propositus of the family with the hypertrophic type of HMSN was due to an increase in muscle and/or connective tissue. Computed tomography of the legs of the propositus of the family with the neuronal type of HMSN showed infiltration of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle by adipose tissue.\r"

  ".W": "We examined median somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 26 patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND). SEPs were recorded with multiple scalp derivations, using both the midfront and the earlobe as references for each subject. Central conduction time (CCT) was abnormal in three patients, but only when using the midfront reference. Moreover, an exclusive alteration of the early prerolandic potentials (absent or delayed P20 and/or P22) was noted using the earlobe reference in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in progressive bulbar palsy (54% and 50% of patients, respectively) but not in progressive muscular atrophy. These findings correlated with clinical evidence of upper motor neuron signs and with the severity of the disease. In agreement with recent views regarding the sources of the early anterior cortical responses, neuronal loss in the motor cortex may be considered as affecting the generator sites of these potentials.\r"

  ".W": "Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor, and only limited information is available about its natural history and the effects of therapy. We studied 105 patients (75 female and 30 male; mean age, 46 years) with adrenocortical carcinoma who were referred to us between 1963 and 1987. The average duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 8.7 months. At the time of diagnosis, 68 percent of the patients had endocrine symptoms, and 30 percent had distant metastases. Hormonal studies showed that 79 percent of the tumors were functional. Eighty patients underwent surgery, and 59 also received the adrenal cytotoxic agent mitotane. The median disease-free interval after surgery was 12.1 months (range, 1 to 175). Tumor dissemination occurred in 82 percent of the patients, most commonly to the lung, liver, and adjacent organs. The median survival time was 14.5 months (range, less than 1 to 175), and the five-year survival was 22 percent. Age over 40 years and the presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis were the only factors recognized as indicating a poor prognosis. Mitotane controlled hormonal secretion in 75 percent of the patients. Eight mitotane-treated patients had partial tumor regression, but the drug did not have a significant effect on survival. We conclude that adrenocortical carcinoma carries a poor prognosis. Mitotane therapy may offer transient benefits, particularly in controlling endocrine symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "90220768\r", 
  ".W": "Florida is one of several states that have sought to protect newborns by requiring that mothers known to have used alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy be reported to health authorities. To estimate the prevalence of substance abuse by pregnant women, we collected urine samples from all pregnant women who enrolled for prenatal care at any of the five public health clinics in Pinellas County, Florida (n = 380), or at any of 12 private obstetrical offices in the county (n = 335); each center was studied for a one-month period during the first half of 1989. Toxicologic screening for alcohol, opiates, cocaine and its metabolites, and cannabinoids was performed blindly with the use of an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique; all positive results were confirmed. Among the 715 pregnant women we screened, the overall prevalence of a positive result on the toxicologic tests of urine was 14.8 percent; there was little difference in prevalence between the women seen at the public clinics (16.3 percent) and those seen at the private offices (13.1 percent). The frequency of a positive result was also similar among white women (15.4 percent) and black women (14.1 percent). Black women more frequently had evidence of cocaine use (7.5 percent vs. 1.8 percent for white women), whereas white women more frequently had evidence of the use of cannabinoids (14.4 percent vs. 6.0 percent for black women). During the six-month period in which we collected the urine samples, 133 women in Pinellas County were reported to health authorities after delivery for substance abuse during pregnancy. Despite the similar rates of substance abuse among black and white women in our study, black women were reported at approximately 10 times the rate for white women (P less than 0.0001), and poor women were more likely than others to be reported. We conclude that the use of illicit drugs is common among pregnant women regardless of race and socio-economic status. If legally mandated reporting is to be free of racial or economic bias, it must be based on objective medical criteria.\r"

  ".W": "Working at night results in a misalignment between the sleep-wake cycle and the output of the hypothalamic pacemaker that regulates the circadian rhythms of certain physiologic and behavioral variables. We evaluated whether such physiologic maladaptation to nighttime work could be prevented effectively by a treatment regimen of exposure to bright light during the night and darkness during the day. We assessed the functioning of the circadian pacemaker in five control and five treatment studies in order to assess the extent of adaptation in eight normal young men to a week of night work. In the control studies, on the sixth consecutive night of sedentary work in ordinary light (approximately 150 lux), the mean (+/- SEM) nadir of the endogenous temperature cycle continued to occur during the night (at 3:31 +/- 0:56 hours), indicating a lack of circadian adaptation to the nighttime work schedule. In contrast, the subjects in the treatment studies were exposed to bright light (7000 to 12,000 lux) at night and to nearly complete darkness during the day, and the temperature nadir shifted after four days of treatment to a significantly later, midafternoon hour (14:53 +/- 0:32; P less than 0.0001), indicating a successful circadian adaptation to daytime sleep and nighttime work. There were concomitant shifts in the 24-hour patterns of plasma cortisol concentration, urinary excretion rate, subjective assessment of alertness, and cognitive performance in the treatment studies. These shifts resulted in a significant improvement in both alertness and cognitive performance in the treatment group during the night-shift hours. We conclude that maladaptation of the human circadian system to night work, with its associated decline in alertness, performance, and quality of daytime sleep, can be treated effectively with scheduled exposure to bright light at night and darkness during the day.\r"

To investigate the role of complement in Crohn's disease we measured jejunal-fluid concentrations of the complement components C4, C3, and factor B by perfusion of a closed segment of the jejunum in 22 patients with Crohn's disease thought to be limited to the terminal ileum. The mean (+/- SEM) jejunal-fluid C4 concentration was 2.0 +/- 0.3 mg per liter, significantly higher than the mean level in 35 healthy controls (0.7 +/- 0.1 mg per liter; P less than 0.001). The mean C3 concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.1 mg per liter in the patients and 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg per liter in the controls (P less than 0.05). The factor B levels were similar in the two groups. Calculated rates of intestinal secretion of these components showed differences of the same magnitude. Leakage of protein from plasma was not increased. The jejunal-fluid:serum ratios of these complement proteins indicated that their appearance in the lumen of the jejunum was due to at least in part to local mucosal synthesis. The increased jejunal secretion of C4, but not C3 or factor B, paralleled the clinical activity of Crohn's disease. Values were normal in first-degree relatives of the patients (n = 13), patients with celiac disease (n = 8), and patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 4). We conclude that increased secretion of complement by clinically unaffected jejunal tissue in patients with Crohn's disease reflects the systemic nature of this disorder and may be due to the stimulated synthesis of complement by activated intestinal monocytes and macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency and outcome of hypoglycemia during diarrhea in childhood, we screened 2003 consecutive patients less than 15 years of age who were admitted to a diarrhea treatment center in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose concentration less than 2.2 mmol per liter, was found in 91 patients (4.5 percent), 39 (42.9 percent) of whom died. We also measured the plasma concentrations of glucoregulatory hormones and gluconeogenetic substrates in 46 of the patients with hypoglycemia who were 2 to 15 years old and in 25 normoglycemic patients matched with them for age and weight. The patients with hypoglycemia had had diarrhea for less time than the normoglycemic patients (median, 12 vs. 72 hours; P less than 0.05), and their last feeding had been 18 hours before admission, as compared with 9 hours for the normoglycemic patients (P less than 0.05). The groups were similar in terms of nutritional status, the proportion of patients who had fever, and the types of pathogens recovered from stool samples. The plasma C-peptide concentrations were low (less than 0.30 nmol per liter) in all the hypoglycemic patients. As compared with the normoglycemic patients, the patients with hypoglycemia had elevated median plasma concentrations of glucagon (44 vs. 11 pmol per liter; P = 0.001), epinephrine (3400 vs. 1500 pmol per liter; P = 0.012), norepinephrine (7500 vs. 2900 pmol per liter; P = 0.002), and lactate (3.5 vs. 2.1 mmol per liter; P = 0.020) and similar alanine and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Eighteen hypoglycemic patients with severe malnutrition had been ill longer than 26 better-nourished patients with hypoglycemia (median duration of illness, 18 vs. 10 hours; P = 0.023) and had lower median plasma concentrations of lactate (1.9 vs. 3.9 mmol per liter; P = 0.021) and alanine (173 vs. 293 micromol per liter; P = 0.040). We conclude that hypoglycemia is a major cause of death in association with diarrhea. Because the glucose counterregulatory hormones were appropriately elevated in the children with diarrhea and hypoglycemia, whereas the gluconeogenetic substrates were inappropriately low, we further conclude that the hypoglycemia observed in such patients is most often due to the failure of gluconeogenesis.\r"

Both severe damage to the preserved DNA, primarily due to oxidation of the pyrimidines, has prevented the acquisition of sequence data from ancient samples except in a few cases. We report here the extraction of DNA from fossil leaf samples from the Miocene Clarkia deposit (17-20 Myr old), the amplification of an 820-base pair (bp) DNA fragment from the chloroplast gene rbcL from a fossil of the genus Magnolia, and its subsequent sequencing. The sequence was verified by comparison with published and unpublished rbcL sequences. These results extend our ability to analyse ancient DNA and may open new avenues into problems in palaeobotany, biogeography, and in the calibration of mutation rates.\r"

Although in all CF families the disease is linked to a locus on chromosome 7q31, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity of the disease and the age at which it is diagnosed. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. A three-nucleotide deletion (delta F508) causing the loss of a phenylalanine residue in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene has been found on 70% of CF chromosomes. We have now characterized a CF family in which neither parent of the affected individual carries the common mutation, and identified a two-nucleotide insertion in the CF allele of the mother. The mutation introduces a termination codon in exon 13 of the CFTR gene at residue 821, and is predicted to result in the production of a severely truncated nonfunctional protein.\r"

Among the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the accumulation of AChR molecules is the localized expression of AChR subunit genes in the sarcoplasmic nuclei underlying the motor endplate, referred to as 'fundamental' by Ranvier. Immunocytochemical analysis has revealed that in innervated muscle fibres, the Golgi apparatus is also localized to subjunctional domains. We now report an accumulation of cold-stable and acetylated microtubules in the region of the sarcoplasm underlying the endplate. Together, these observations indicate that the subsynaptic sarcoplasm represents a compartment that is specialized both for the transcription, post-translational processing and stabilization of proteins of the postsynaptic membrane, in particular AChR, and for their targeting to the motor endplate.\r"

  ".U": "90220874\r", 
  ".W": "At mitosis in eukaryotic cells there are profound changes of shape and structure whose causes are almost entirely obscure. What is known is that there are changes in the organization of microfilaments, including the disassembly of microfilament bundles during prophases and the accompanying rounding-up of cultured cells; the formation of transient contractile rings during cytokinesis; and, subsequently, the reassembly of microfilament bundles and the respreading of the two daughter cells. As an initial step towards the biochemical understanding of these events, in which the disassembly and reassembly of microfilaments appear to play an important part, we searched for alterations of the molecular constitution of microfilaments during mitosis. We found that non-muscle caldesmon, a protein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 83,000 (83K) which binds to actin and calmodulin, is dissociated from microfilaments during mitosis, apparently as a consequence of phosphorylation. This process may contribute to the changes of shape and structure of cells in mitosis, as caldesmon inhibits actomyosin ATPase.\r"

  ".U": "90220877\r", 
  ".W": "The disulphide-bonded intermediates that accumulate in the oxidative folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) were characterized some time ago. Structural characterization of these intermediates would provide an explanation of the kinetically preferred pathways of folding for BPTI. When folding occurs under strongly oxidizing conditions, more than half the molecules become trapped in an intermediate, designated N*, which is similar to the native protein but lacks the 30-51 disulphide bond. We have tested the hypothesis that the precursor to N* is the one-disulphide intermediate [5-55], which contains the most stable disulphide in BPTI, and present evidence here that this is the case. A peptide model of [5-55], corresponding to a subdomain of BPTI, seems to fold into a native-like conformation, explaining why [5-55] does not lead to native protein and why it folds rapidly to N*. A native-like subdomain structure in a peptide model of [30-51], the other crucial one-disulphide intermediate, may explain the route by which [30-51] folds to native protein. Thus, much of the folding pathway of BPTI can be explained by the formation of a native-like subdomain in these two early intermediates. This suggests that a large part of the protein folding problem can be reduced to identifying and understanding subdomains of native proteins.\r"

  ".W": "CA 125 has been found in high concentrations in human amniotic fluid throughout gestation, with significant quantities seen in the decidua and chorion. Because disruption of the epithelial basement membrane of the fetal membrane or the decidua could theoretically lead to a rise in maternal CA 125 levels, this increase may be a predictor of subsequent spontaneous abortion of the fetus. A study was initiated to investigate whether a sudden rise in the serum CA 125 level might predict spontaneous first-trimester abortions. CA 125 levels of 101 pregnant women were evaluated 18-22 days from conception and 6 weeks from conception (a frequent time for spontaneous abortion) to determine whether there is a sudden increase (from baseline or early trimester levels) during the middle or late first trimester immediately before or at the time of abortion. The results indicated that although there was a definite correlation found between elevation of CA 125 and spontaneous abortion, the higher levels occurred early in the first trimester whereas the majority of abortions did not occur until much later, after fetal viability was established. Six of ten women with CA 125 levels of 150 U/mL or greater aborted, compared with four of 92 women with CA 125 levels less than 150 U/mL. One of 11 women pregnant after in vitro fertilization had a CA 125 level above 150 U/mL, and she aborted.\r"

There is no alternate therapy. Because of compliance problems with erythromycin regimens due to gastrointestinal side effects, such an alternative is needed. For this reason, we compared, in an open trial, the efficacy and patient compliance of amoxicillin (500 mg three times a day for 7 days) with those of erythromycin base (500 mg four times a day for 7 days) in treating C trachomatis cervical infections during pregnancy. In the amoxicillin group, 63 of 64 women (98.4%) had negative cervical cultures after treatment, compared with 55 of 58 women (94.8%) treated with erythromycin base. Vertical transmission to the infants was assessed by culture and/or persistent or rising immunoglobulin G antichlamydial antibody. In the amoxicillin group, 37 of 39 infants (94.9%) had no evidence of chlamydial infection, compared with 32 of 36 infants (88.8%) in the erythromycin group. These differences were not significant. The frequency of side effects was higher with erythromycin base than with amoxicillin (15 versus 8%), although not significantly so. However, the frequency of stopping medication because of side effects was significantly higher with erythromycin base than with amoxicillin (13 versus 2%; P less than .006). These results suggest that amoxicillin may be an acceptable alternative treatment for chlamydial infections in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-two women undergoing labor induction and vaginal delivery at term were randomized between two oxytocin infusion protocols, involving hourly versus quarter-hourly increases in dose. Potential differences were sought of duration of labor, amount of uterine activity generated, and amount of oxytocin required. Starting at 0.5 mU/minute, oxytocin infusion was increased regularly in small increments every hour or every 15 minutes, according to group assignment. No differences were observed in potentially confounding clinical and demographic factors between the groups, including time to ruptured membranes. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences found for the duration of any phase or stage of labor, quantitative assessment of uterine activity, incidence of hyperstimulation, or neonatal outcome. The average dose of oxytocin used was lower in the hourly than in the quarter-hourly, protocol (4.4 versus 6.7 mU/minute; P less than .005). Significantly fewer patients on the hourly protocol required a maximum infusion rate exceeding 8 mU/minute (P less than .05). More patients on the hourly protocol either had oxytocin discontinued completely or were maintained at 4 mU/minute or less during the active phase of labor (P less than .05 and P less than .001, respectively). We conclude that a slower rate of increase in oxytocin administration via continuous infusion results in no prolongation of any phase of induced labor, while permitting lower infusion rates of the drug.\r"

The medical records were reviewed retrospectively for 37 term pregnant patients diagnosed as having uterine hyperstimulation during labor. None of them had medical or obstetric complications. Twenty-two of them received oxytocin augmentation for abnormal labor. Although the vast majority of these patients had a decrease of the hyperstimulation while being given the magnesium, 31.8% in the group receiving oxytocin alone (P less than .05). Fifteen additional patients received magnesium sulfate for uterine hyperstimulation although they were not receiving oxytocin; of these, 16.7% required cesarean delivery. This rate was no different from that of the patients who required labor augmentation, but was double the overall primary cesarean rate at our hospital. There appears to be a group of patients with abnormal uterine activity (either spontaneous or associated with oxytocin augmentation) that responds to treatment with magnesium sulfate.\r"

The association with SGA status was identical for smokers and non-smokers. Thus, the increase of SGA infants in women whose pregnancies are complicated by abruption is not explained by maternal smoking, and in some cases may result from placental dysfunction induced by the process of placental separation.\r"

To identify the factor responsible for this thyroid activation, we measured the serum thyroid-stimulating activity in comparison with the serum level of hCG in 39 normal women in early pregnancy. Serum thyroid-stimulating activity was measured by a sensitive cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation assay using a rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5). Thyroid-stimulating activity was detected in 37 women (95%), and the activities of individuals correlated positively with their serum free T4 levels (r = 0.474; P less than .01) and negatively with their serum TSH levels (r = -0.376; P less than .02). Moreover, serum thyroid-stimulating activity correlated closely with the serum hCG level (r = 0.741; P less than .001), but was completely abolished by pre-treatment of the sera with hCG antibodies. These data indicate that in normal early pregnancy, the thyroid gland is physiologically activated by serum hCG, which has intrinsic thyroid-stimulating activity.\r"

No significant differences in amniotic fluid immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor levels were observed at the different stages of cervical dilatation.

  ".W": "Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maternal and neonatal outcome was evaluated in 15 triplet and twin pregnancies that were matched for maternal age, race, type of medical insurance, delivery mode, parity, and history of previous preterm delivery. Preterm labor occurred significantly more often in triplet than in twin gestations (80 versus 40%), as did preterm delivery (87 versus 26.7%). Triplets had a significantly lower mean birth weight (1720 versus 2475 g) and gestational age at delivery (33 versus 36.6 weeks). In addition, 53.3% of triplet pregnancies but only 6.7% of twin pregnancies had one or more neonates with intrauterine growth retardation. Discordancy also occurred more frequently in triplets than in twins (66.7 versus 13.3%). The mean averaged neonatal hospital stay was significantly higher in triplets (29 versus 8.5 days), and triplets had a fivefold increased risk of requiring neonatal intensive care as compared with twins. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in maternal morbidity or major neonatal complications such as respiratory distress syndrome or intraventricular hemorrhage. We believe that these data will be useful in counseling patients with respect to the anticipated perinatal outcome of triplet pregnancies.\r"

Medical record review provided information on indications for method of delivery, delivery complications and injuries, neonatal complications, and neurologic sequelae up to 4 years of age. The relative risk estimates for asphyxia (1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.7, 1.4), head trauma (1.6; 95% confidence interval 0.2, 17.0), neonatal seizures (0.8; 95% confidence interval 0.1, 7.1), cerebral palsy (1.6; 95% confidence interval 0.2, 17.4), and developmental delay (2.0; 95% confidence interval 0.9, 4.4) for vaginally born compared with cesarean-delivered infants indicated that vaginally born infants were not at increased risk for these outcomes. We used multiple logistic regression to control for confounding variables. The adjusted relative risk estimate for the combined-outcome category of head trauma, neonatal seizures, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or spasticity was 0.5 in vaginally delivered infants (95% confidence interval 0.1, 3.2). When all morbid outcomes were considered in combination, the adjusted relative risk estimate was 0.9 for vaginally delivered infants (95% confidence interval 0.6, 1.4).\r"

Cefoperazone concentration plateaued at a fetal concentration of 4-5 micrograms/mL in a recirculating perfusion system. No evidence of a decreasing slope of ceftizoxime transfer to the fetal compartment was noted after 60 minutes of perfusion. In a closed-closed perfusion system with equal concentrations of ceftizoxime in each compartment, a 1.1:1 fetal gradient was noted. These data indicate that ceftizoxime crosses the placenta significantly better than does cefoperazone and support our in vivo study documenting preferential concentration of ceftizoxime in the fetal compartment.\r"

Thirty-four women who underwent the minimal-incision urethropexy procedure were studied for up to 13 months postoperatively. Although 21 patients also had the anterior vaginal wall opened to perform concomitant pelvic-floor surgery, the principles of minimal suprapubic incision, full-thickness vaginal sutures, and no dissection of endopelvic fascia were followed strictly in all 34 cases. With a mean follow-up of 9.5 months, the objective cure rate was 91% and subjectively, 97% of the patients were either cured or improved. This technically simpler procedure is effective for treating genuine stress urinary incontinence in women who also require surgical repair of other pelvic-floor defects.\r"

Eighty-seven exercisers (30%) noted incontinence during at least one type of exercise. Incontinence exclusively during exercise was seen in only one woman. Exercises involving repetitive bouncing were associated with the highest incidence of incontinence. Seventeen incontinent exercisers (20%) stopped an exercise because of incontinence, whereas 16 (18%) changed the way a specific exercise was done and 48 (55%) wore a pad during exercise. Thirty-five percent had discussed their incontinence with a health care professional. These data suggest that incontinence during exercise is a common, although little known, problem. In addition to the behavioral adaptations which women initiate on their own, surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be of benefit.\r"

  ".W": "Although incontinence has been reported after radical vulvectomy, its relationship to operative technique, anatomy, and treatment has not been defined. Twenty-one patients having vulvectomies for vulvar cancer were prospectively evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with urodynamic function studies. A portion of the urethra was removed in four patients undergoing radical vulvectomy, and 14 had a vulvectomy excision that came within 1 cm of the distal urethra. Six patients (28%) developed a change of continence, with three developing total incontinence, two stress incontinence, and one urge incontinence. All four patients who had a portion of the urethra excised developed stress or total incontinence. The other two patients with incontinence (one total, one urge) had the vulvectomy excision that came close to the urethra. No patient had a change in continence when surgery did not involve or come close to the urethra. When the four patients with a distal urethral resection were compared with patients in whom the urethra was not excised, there was a significant decrease postoperatively in functional urethral length (P less than .0001), anatomical urethral length (P less than .0001), and distal urethral pressure transmission ratios in Q3 (P = .004), Q4 (P = .02), and Q5 (P = .005); but no difference in urethral support (Q-tip test), flow rates, residual urine, bladder capacity, maximal urethral pressure, resting closure pressure, or squeeze pressure. Histologic examination of urethral specimens demonstrated that a portion of the compressor urethrae muscle was often excised. Radical vulvectomy by itself does not cause incontinence, but it would appear that removal of a portion of the urethra increases the chance of incontinence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As with cervical cancer, risk increased with the number of reported lifetime sexual partners, with five or more partners associated with two- to threefold increases in risk compared with zero to one partner. This factor largely explained the associations of risk with early age at first intercourse and low socioeconomic status. An independent association, however, was noted between vulvar cancer and a history of genital warts (relative risk 15.2; 95% confidence interval 5.5-42.1). Women who reported a previous abnormal Papanicolaou smear were at excess risk (relative risk 1.8), as were current smokers (relative risk 2.0). A significant interaction was noted between smoking and genital warts, with women reporting both having 35 times the risk of those with neither factor. Menstrual, reproductive, and hygiene factors were generally unrelated to risk. The relationships with sexual factors and genital warts support a common etiology for cervical and vulvar cancers. Future studies should focus on the etiologic agents for genital warts--the human papillomaviruses--and their enhancement by other factors, especially smoking and/or immune deficiencies.\r"

Two oculoplastic surgical procedures, cosmetic blepharoplasty and acquired blepharoptosis treatment, were analyzed. One hundred forty-five patients and 85 referring physicians of the practices of five oculoplastic surgeons were questioned. Sixty-nine additional oculoplastic surgeons were also surveyed. The results of treatment were consistently emphasized as the most important factor in patient satisfaction, a finding that contrasted greatly with the decreased emphasis on the cost of treatment. This implies that patients value the quality of medical care and are willing to pay for it. The preference of patients contrasts sharply with the trend of government and third-party payers to emphasize cost containment at the possible sacrifice of quality of care. The surveys also showed that pain and discomfort and office waiting time are more important to patient satisfaction than oculoplastic surgeons realize and that the surgeons will have to address these issues in order to improve satisfaction. Also, there is a falloff of surgeon-patient communication postoperatively which is less satisfying to patients and recognized, but not acted on, by surgeons. Therefore, more postoperative surgeon-patient communication by telephone is also likely to improve patient satisfaction.\r"

Anesthesia was successfully induced in the majority of these patients and all surgeries were carried out successfully with no major complications. Voluntary eye movements remained but did not interfere with surgery. On the contrary, they helped expose certain surgical sites. This new anesthetic method for cataract surgery is simple and minimizes complications attributed to other blind anesthetic techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The response of human subconjunctival fibroblasts to a variety of pharmacological agents was evaluated utilizing a novel in vitro wound assay and a separate proliferation assay. Both colchicine and cytochalasin B dramatically arrested wound closure at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.01 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively (p less than 0.05). At lower doses these drugs altered fibroblast morphology and inhibited directed cell migration. Dexamethasone and 6-MP delayed wound closure at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml and 1000 micrograms/ml, respectively (p less than 0.05). Effective antiproliferative agents, in order of decreasing potency (based on unit weight), were Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), colchicine, 5-fluorouracil, cytochalasin B, cyclosporin (Sandimmune), 6-mercaptopurine, and dexamethasone. The antiprotease agents and methotrexate were ineffective as determined by both assays. We conclude that the wound assay is well suited for rapid screening of drugs for their effect on fibroblast morphology, motility, and proliferation, and that colchicine and cytochalasin B, in doses well below those documented to produce ocular toxicity, are effective in inhibiting directed migration and proliferation of subconjunctival fibroblasts in vitro. Differences in mechanism, onset of action, therapeutic range, and cytotoxicity of drugs could be exploited in controlling ocular fibroblast behavior in vivo.\r"

Intraocular pressure and gross facility of aqueous outflow following surgery were not influenced by either treatment, although blebs persisted longer in the irradiated eyes. Steroids reduced clinically observable inflammation as well as the number of inflammatory cells identifiable by microscopy. Fibroblast production temporarily slowed, and ultra-structural examination demonstrated lipid-filled vacuoles and dilated mitochondria in these eyes. Also, the scar was thinner at 24 days. Beta irradiation delayed wound healing and the scar was thinner in the early postoperative stages, but the light microscopic appearance of the scar was unaltered at 59 days. Inflammation was more pronounced initially, with abundant fibrin in the wound. Recovery of the conjunctival epithelium was delayed. The delay in fibroblast recruitment and wound contraction, the thinner scar tissue, and the increased survival of the bleb are all factors that suggest that beta irradiation may be a useful adjunct to glaucoma surgery.\r"

The monkeys were then killed and the eyes studied by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. In general, tissue responses to, and routes of aqueous flow associated with both shunts were similar: fibrous encapsulation of the drainage tubes and encircling bands, with aqueous flow through these fibrous capsules.\r"

This device provided excellent visualization of posterior and peripheral intraocular structures and maintained a closed system during surgery. Corneal grafts remained clear in 80% of the cases, and macular attachment was achieved with either silicone oil or perfluoropropane gas in 50% of cases followed for at least 6 months. Visual function remained the same or improved in three eyes. Suggested refinements to the placement of this device include enlarging the trephination to 6.75 mm and the use of 8-0 nylon sutures to prevent cheesewiring of the soft silicone rim. A plano contact lens required during surgery to visualize the retina did not minify the image. Since the optical cylinder of the Eckardt temporary keratoprosthesis is shorter than that of a Landers-Foulks keratoprosthesis of similar diameter, it provides greater peripheral visualization. It is, however, less durable.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between blood pressure and diabetic retinopathy was evaluated in 249 young subjects with type I diabetes. Although hypertension is known to be associated with an increased risk for retinopathy, the effects of high-normal blood pressure are unknown. Retinopathy (158 of 249 subjects, 63%) is considerably more common in a young diabetic population than is hypertension (7 of 249 subjects, 2%). Thus, if blood pressure is important in the etiology or progression of diabetic retinopathy, levels below the hypertensive range (less than 141/90 mmHg) must be considered. The combined effect of hypertension and high-normal blood pressure (greater than 90th percentile but less than 141/90 mmHg) was studied. Elevation in diastolic blood pressure, alone, and in combination with elevated systolic blood pressure, correlated significantly (P less than 0.03) with retinopathy. The presence of high-normal blood pressure resulted in a prospectively higher occurrence of retinopathy and of progression of preexisting retinopathy. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1) and duration of diabetes also correlated with retinopathy. Both good glycemic control and maintenance of diastolic blood pressure below the 90th percentile for age may be important in relation to diabetic retinopathy.\r"

Perifoveal flow velocity was determined, using the blue-light entoptoscope, and arterial calibers measured, using a computer-aided digitizing system. Mean plasma glucose level was lowered from 17.7 +/- 4 to 7.0 +/- 1 mmol/l after a subcutaneous insulin infusion and measurements taken at both glucose levels. The autoregulatory change induced by breathing 60% oxygen at the two plasma glucose levels also was compared. Mean flow velocities were 0.54 +/- 0.28 mm/sec at a high plasma glucose level compared with 0.55 +/- 0.32 mm/sec at a low plasma glucose level, whereas hyperoxia reduced these by 16.58 and 16.71%, respectively. No significant difference in the responses of arterial diameters to hyperoxia between the two glucose levels was found. The authors conclude that acute reduction in plasma glucose level in this group of patients is not associated with significant changes in macular blood flow or in alteration in autoregulation.\r"

The authors recently evaluated a 71-year-old woman who presented with an asymptomatic calcific embolus in her right infero-temporal branch retinal artery. Classic venous-stasis retinopathy that was limited to the territory of the obstructed arteriole was present concurrently. This case appears to demonstrate that chronic retinal hypoperfusion and resultant venous-stasis retinopathy can be produced by not only high-grade, fixed stenosis but also by embolic disease.\r"

The results analyzed in three age groups (0-30 years, 31-60 years, and older than 60 years) show that there is a progressive accumulation of lipids in Bruch's membrane with relation to age. Differences were found in the specific types of lipids in individual eyes. Five eyes stained for neutral lipids alone, four stained predominantly for phospholipids, and nine stained intensely for both neutral lipids and phospholipids. The deposits were associated with the progressive destruction of the native architecture of Bruch's membrane but no correlation was identified between specific inclusions in Bruch's membrane with a particular lipid. These results are significant to age-related macular disease (ARMD), and the lipid rich barrier in Bruch's membrane is implicated as a cause of photoreceptor dysfunction and pigment epithelial detachment.\r"

A pars plana vitrectomy was necessary in a total of eight eyes that either initially presented with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (1 case), posterior retinal breaks (1 case), subretinal fibrosis (1 case), vitreoretinal traction bands (1 case), or had persistent vitreoretinal traction after failed scleral buckling procedures (4 cases). Visual acuity stabilized or improved in 13 of the 14 eyes with successful retinal reattachment. Because these cases often have significant vitreoretinal traction and/or posterior retinal breaks, pars plana vitrectomy in conjunction with scleral buckling may be necessary in order to achieve long-term retinal reattachment.\r"

Intraocular pressure was recorded continuously during intravitreal infusion of saline solution before and after the application of encircling silicone elements. Scleral buckling produced a marked reduction in ocular rigidity, with reversibility of the effect on removal of the buckling elements. Similar results were obtained during incremental intravitreal air injection. The authors propose that the greater extensibility of silicone compared with sclera and the induced alterations in ocular shape are the primary factors responsible for the observed change in ocular rigidity. The clinical implications of these findings for intravitreal gas injection are discussed.\r"

Ocular manifestations were: iridocyclitis in three eyes, vitreitis in one eye, retinitis or neuroretinitis in five eyes, papillitis in two eyes, optic perineuritis in two eyes, and retrobulbar optic neuritis in two eyes. Three patients diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had the worst initial visual acuities. Six of nine patients had evidence of concomitant central nervous syndrome (CNS) involvement with syphilis. Benzathine penicillin was administered intramuscularly to three patients. All three had relapses. Seven of nine patients treated intravenously with high-dose penicillin had dramatic responses to therapy with improvement in vision and serologies and no evidence of relapse.

The median interval from CMV retinopathy diagnosis to death for patients whose infection was diagnosed between May 1984 and September 1987 was 5 months. The interval had increased significantly since 1981. The interval from AIDS diagnosis to CMV retinopathy diagnosis (median, 9 months) did not increase. Based on extent and location of retinal lesions at the time patients were first examined, increased survival could not be attributed to earlier diagnosis of CMV retinopathy. Patients treated with ganciclovir lived longer after diagnosis of CMV retinopathy (median, 7 months) than untreated patients (median, 2 months; P less than 0.001). Although this finding suggests that ganciclovir may prolong survival, the effect of treatment cannot be established conclusively because patients were not randomly assigned to treatment or no treatment groups. The location of retinal lesions had no apparent prognostic significance for survival. Survival after diagnosis of AIDS was significantly shorter if CMV retinopathy was the initial manifestation of the syndrome.\r"

This case is historically significant, in that Verhoeff and Reese debated as to whether this tumor regressed spontaneously or secondary to irradiation. Results of histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural examination showed a chorioretinal, neuroglial scar without evidence of calcification, necrotic tumor cells, or residual retinoblastoma. The authors discuss the clinical and histopathologic findings in spontaneously regressed retinoblastoma, retinoma/retinocytoma, and irradiated retinoblastoma.

  ".W": "Large increases in the intraocular pressure (IOP) of postoperative gas-containing eyes may require the removal of gas or fluid to reduce the IOP to the normal range. Application of the ideal gas law to Friedenwald's equation provides a mathematical model of the relationship between IOP, intraocular gas and fluid volumes, and the coefficient of scleral rigidity. This mathematic model shows that removal of a given volume of gas or fluid produces an identical decrease in IOP and that the more gas an eye contains, the greater the volume reduction necessary to reduce the pressure. Application of the model shows that the effective coefficient of scleral rigidity is low (mean K, 0.0021) in eyes with elevated IOP that have undergone vitrectomy and retinal cryopexy and very low (mean K, 0.0013) in eyes with elevated IOP that have undergone placement of a scleral buckle and band. By using the appropriate mean coefficient of rigidity, the volume of material to be aspirated to produce a given decrease in IOP can be predicted with clinically useful accuracy.\r"

Resolution exceeds that of current combined A- and B-scan imaging devices by a factor of approximately 10. Microscopic images of ocular structures including Schlemm's canal, cornea, iris, ciliary muscles, and retina have been produced in eye bank eyes. These studies show the feasibility of developing an apparatus to be used in the clinical setting for examining anterior structures of the eye not visible by current techniques.\r"

The prognosis for recovery of vision with penetrating keratoplasty and the exchange of one type of AC IOL for another remains controversial. A total of 40 consecutive patients with closed-loop AC IOLs and varying degrees of PBK underwent penetrating keratoplasty, explanation of the closed-loop AC IOL, and implantation of a flexible tripod AC IOL--all done with a uniform technique. The average follow-up study was 24 months. Average preoperative visual acuity was 20/170 (range, 20/25-hand motions) and average postoperative visual acuity was 20/44 (range, 20/20-no light perception). A total of 23 eyes (57.5%) achieved a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Eleven eyes (27.5%) had a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Persistent cystoid macular edema was the most frequent cause of poor vision postoperatively (4 eyes), followed by age-related macular degeneration (3 eyes) and graft rejection (2 eyes). This is the first series documenting a good visual outcome for at least 2 years after penetrating keratoplasty and exchange of a closed-loop AC IOL for a single type of flexible tripod AC IOL.\r"

The filtration angle of each eye was examined with routine postoperative gonioscopy in a prospective manner. Peripheral anterior synechia (PAS) overlying the position of the lens haptic (lens haptic PAS) were observed in up to 80% of eyes implanted with haptics vaulted anteriorly by 10 degrees. The rate of occurrence of lens haptic PAS was reduced by a statistically significant level in a group of eyes implanted with nonvaulted haptics. Most of the lens haptic PAS were observed early in the postoperative period and remained stable in size. Progression in size was noted quantitatively in three eyes and documented with goniophotography in two eyes. A delay in the presentation of lens haptic PAS was observed in seven eyes. A postoperative increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with enlargement of lens haptic PAS developed in one patient with preoperative chronic open-angle glaucoma. These observations support others that progressive PAS overlying posterior chamber lens haptics can be a form of progressive angle-closure glaucoma in pseudophakia. This mechanism may be more likely to occur in eyes implanted with anterior vaulted haptics.\r"

The clinical course of eight patients with this complication was reviewed. Six patients had chronic angle-closure glaucoma. Only one patient responded to medical therapy which included frequent topical application of atropine sulfate 3.0% for 1 hour. Reformation of the anterior chamber with air and drainage of any suprachoroidal fluid was immediately performed in the remaining seven. At the time of follow-up (mean, 16 months), the glaucoma was controlled in all eyes except one. The mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg in those eyes not requiring reoperation. Six (75%) of eight eyes had diffuse, succulent filter blebs. Five eyes (63%) required no antiglaucoma medications, one eye (12%) required one, one eye (12%) required two, and one eye (12%) underwent repeat filtering surgery. The results suggest that, once medical therapy is not immediately successful, prompt surgical reformation of the anterior chamber along with drainage of any suprachoroidal fluid may preserve the filter blebs in these eyes.\r"

Foveal thresholds were unaffected in the diabetic patients but significant reductions in visual field sensitivity, measured by both the mean deviation and the pattern standard deviation indices of visual field sensitivity, were observed in the diabetic patients. Subgroup analyses showed that this sensitivity reduction primarily occurred in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients. Among the diabetic patients, 26.3% of the visual fields were flagged as \"probably abnormal.\" This percentage was greatest among the noninsulin-dependent patients with mild background diabetic retinopathy (72.3%). The sensitivity reductions observed in the noninsulin-dependent patients with mild background diabetic retinopathy tended to be localized in the superior quadrants and correlated with the extent of retinal vascular compromise evident from vitreous fluorophotometry (r = 0.603). These findings imply that in diabetic patients visual field defects (1) often can be detected in patients with at most moderate retinopathy, (2) occur more frequently in noninsulin-dependent patients than in insulin-dependent patients, and (3) may result from subclinical microangiopathy.\r"

Furthermore, loss of the integrity of the oral epithelium often provides a microbial portal of entry and leads to sepsis. The present study describes the first animal model for chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The combination of three intraperitoneal injections of 5-fluorouracil at 5-day intervals and superficial mechanical mucosal irritation resulted in clinical breakdown of the oral mucosa characterized by ulcerative mucositis in Golden Syrian hamsters. Both clinical and histologic evaluation demonstrated that these changes were similar to those described in human beings and followed a pattern influenced by the degree of myelosuppression. This model should be of significance in establishing the stomatotoxicity of new chemotherapeutic agents, in evaluating medicaments to treat mucositis, and in studying the influence of oral mucosal breakdown on sepsis in myelosuppressed persons.\r"

Both saliva and broth significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine against all microorganisms tested as compared to glucose 5% (p less than 0.01). Minimum bactericidal concentrations for indigenous flora were significantly lower than the values obtained for the \"hospital-acquired\" microorganisms (p less than 0.05). These observations of chlorhexidine inactivation by saliva may explain why chlorhexidine mouth rinsing is of limited value in decontaminating the oral cavity.\r"

Almost all the respondents did not mind the dentist wearing either gloves or masks during treatment. One third of the total population were ignorant about sterilization methods used in dentistry. One half of the hospital patients and one third of the general practice patients thought that infectious diseases could be contracted via the dentist or his instruments. Although two in three of the respondents surmised that transmission of AIDS in the dental clinic is unlikely, one half of the general practice patients were unwilling to visit the dentist if the latter was known to treat patients with AIDS. This survey indicates that there is a great deal of confusion and fear among the public on cross-infection in the dental clinic, which needs to be rectified by a properly targeted health education campaign.\r"

Described in this report are the clinicopathologic features of 29 cases labeled basal cell adenocarcinomas that had morphologic characteristics of basal cell adenomas but infiltrative, perineural, and intravascular growth features that indicated a malignant potential. With limited follow-up, seven tumors are known to have recurred, and three of these metastasized to lymph nodes and lung. One patient died with extensive local spread of the tumor. All patients were adults. The peak incidence was in the sixth decade of life, and there was no gender predilection. The parotid gland was the predominant site. A solid type growth configuration was most frequent; membranous, trabecular, and tubular types were less frequent, in that order. Three patients also had dermal cylindromas, perhaps indicative of a salivary gland-skin adnexal diathesis that has been previously reported.\r"

Four of five patients with follow-up data died of their disease. This confirms the lethality of the solid variant.

  ".W": "Although bitewing (BW) radiographs play an indispensable role in the detection of interproximal caries, it is not always clear when they should be made. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that a person's caries and restorative history may be predictive of his or her caries future. Full-mouth radiographic examinations (FMX) and subsequent BW radiographs from 349 adults (age 20 or more) selected at random were examined. Possible risk factors for caries recorded for each patient included the number and type of carious lesions and the restorative experience of the patient. Linear logistic regression models were evaluated to estimate the efficacy of the possible risk factors as predictors of the presence of caries on the BW radiographs. Of the 349 adults examined, 91 (26%) had one or more new carious lesions at the time of their BW examination. The probability of caries in this population at the time of the BW examination increases both with lengthening interval between the FMX and the BW radiographs and with the number of restorations at the time of FMX. A regression model was adopted that estimates the probability of caries being detected on BW radiographs. We found that to provide the most good for the most patients (minimize cost), the threshold level for ordering follow-up radiographs should be when the probability of detecting caries is 5%. It may be seen that even when a person has no caries or restorations at the time of the FMX there will be a 5% chance that BW radiographs will reveal the presence of caries 1.5 years later. The 5% threshold is reached sooner in the presence of caries or restorations.\r"

Cubitus valgus, on the other hand, does have some functional problems. Thus, there is more of a functional reason to correct cubitus valgus deformities. The biologic complications of lateral condyle fractures such as lateral spur formation and the mild cubitus varus that occurs usually do not require surgical intervention. Those problems associated with techniques of treatment, such as a delayed open reduction, non-union, and angulation, again can be remedied surgically. Specific basic principles, as outlined in this article, however, must be followed to achieve success.\r"

(2) There were no differences in somatosensory thresholds between the skin innervated by the affected divisions and the unaffected mirror-image areas in previously unoperated cases of TGN and non-neural facial pain ('atypical facial pain') prior to operative intervention; but there were significant differences in tactile (von Frey) thresholds in the cases of non-TGN facial pain of neural origin. (3) In TGN immediately after operation, thresholds for all modalities except cold sensation were significantly raised. Six months later, tactile and tragus pinch pain thresholds had returned to normal; but thresholds for warmth, hot pain, and pinprick remained elevated. However, in cases who had had previous procedures for TGN between 9 months and 5 years earlier, all thresholds except pinprick and possibly hot pain had returned to normal. (4) Prior to operation for TGN, the skin temperature in the affected division was significantly lower than that in the contralateral unaffected division, presumably due to vasoconstriction. In previously operated cases in whom TGN had re-appeared, cutaneous vasoconstriction was also demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fidelity of the HM3 as an algesimeter was tested by: (1) In vitro measurements of shock pressure at voltages between 14 and 30 kV were recorded by a force transducer at the point of clinical focus. (2) Unanaesthetized volunteer (n = 5) assessment and VAS pain scores of shocks in the range of 10-24 kV, yielding highly significant correlations between blinded randomized shock voltage (r = 0.88), and VAS scores (r = 0.84). (3) Voltage-tolerance curves generated from 33 ASA class 1 or 2 patients undergoing ESWL treatment under epidural analgesia with 0.125% bupivacaine, fortified with a bolus epidural dose of 100 micrograms fentanyl if pain arose during treatment. Voltage tolerance was increased by 50% after an epidural bolus of 100 micrograms fentanyl (P less than 0.001). The respiratory consequences of epidural fentanyl were assessed by changes of respiratory rate and rhythm recorded from capnographic tracings of expired carbon dioxide. This study indicates that the Dornier HM3 system provides a valuable opportunity to conduct precise, quantitative measurements of induced deep truncal pain, as well as the effectiveness and respiratory cost of analgesic interventions directly applicable to the safe management of acute pain.\r"

In 44 neurology patients randomized pain was induced on the middle phalanges of fingers II-IV of both hands using a tension device on the day before lumbar puncture. Pain intensity was measured using the category sub-dividing procedure. The correspondence between experimental pain stimuli and induced pain intensities could best be described by a logarithmic function. PLPS symptoms were documented in a multi-dimensional quantitative fashion using various scales. Pronounced position-dependent headache occurred in 31% of the patients. There proved to be very significant effects of experimental pain sensitivity on intensity and duration of position-dependent headaches, as well as on vegetative symptoms of PLPS (P less than or equal to 0.01). The results provide an explanation for the varying interindividual manifestation of PLPS symptoms, in addition to factors already identified such as the size of needle used in individual patients.\r"

We report population-based data concerning the development and evaluation of a graded classification of pain status. In a probability sample of 1016 health maintenance organization enrollees, recurrent or persistent pain was observed in 45%; severe and persistent pain in 8%; severe and persistent pain with 7 or more days of pain-related activity limitation in 2.7%; and severe, persistent pain with activity limitation and 3 or more indicators of pain dysfunction in 1.0% of the population sample. Graded chronic pain status was associated with psychological impairment, unfavorable appraisal of health status, and frequency of use of pain medications and health care. The presence of severe and persistent pain increased the likelihood of multiple indicators of pain dysfunction, but there was considerable heterogeneity in pain dysfunction among persons with comparable pain experience. Our data suggest grading chronic pain in terms of 3 axes: time (persistence); severity; and impact (disability and dysfunctional illness behaviors).\r"

Analysis of individual variables revealed that CSQ factors, gender, physical examination findings, and chronicity of pain had significant effects on one or more of a series of pain, psychological distress or behavioral measures. To assess the relative contribution of each of these variables hierarchical stepwise regression analyses were carried out. These analyses revealed that the Helplessness factor of the CSQ explained 50% of the variance in psychological distress (Global Severity Index of the SCL-90R), and 46% of the variance in depression (Beck Depression Inventory). Patients scoring high on this CSQ factor had significantly higher levels of psychological distress. None of the demographic or medical status variables explained a significant proportion of variance in the psychological distress measures. The Diverting Attention and Praying factor of the CSQ explained a moderate (9%), but significant amount of variance in pain report. Patients scoring high on this factor had higher scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Coping strategies were not strongly related to pain behavior measures such as guarding or uptime. A consideration of pain coping strategies may allow one to design pain coping skills training interventions so as to fit the needs of the individual low back pain patient.\r"

Sixty-nine women and 74 men, with an average age of 47 years, were included. Patients underwent psychological evaluation which included use of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and 7 visual analog scales (VAS) measuring degree of emotional unpleasantness, pain intensity, anxiety, frustration, fear, anger and depression. Test-retest reliability coefficients were significant for the negative feeling VAS yielding an average reliability coefficient of 0.82. Analyses relating the negative feeling state VAS to pain unpleasantness and depression indices from the MMPI (scale 2) and BDI (sum score) yielded significant canonical correlations. Multiple regression was used to clarify the relationships between negative feeling VAS, pain-related unpleasantness, and indices of depression. After statistically controlling for intensity of pain, anxiety and frustration predicted unpleasantness. Regression analyses indicate that anger is an important concomitant of the depression that pain patients experience. The results suggest that anger and frustration are critical concomitants of the pain experience. Treatment techniques specifically targeting anger and frustration in these patients may prove efficacious.\r"

  ".U": "90221632\r", 
  ".W": "Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from dorsal horn neurones in the lumbar spinal cord of cats which were anaesthetized or were anaemically decerebrated. Each neurone was classified functionally as wide dynamic range (WDR), non-nociceptive, nociceptive specific or proprioceptive. Vibration was then applied to the hind limb using a feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator. WDR neurones had 3 distinct types of response to vibration (80 Hz: 0.3-1.0 mm): excitation, depression and a biphasic response consisting of excitation followed by depression. The type of response depended upon the location of the stimulator probe. With the stimulator probe placed inside that part of the receptive field from which low intensity, non-vibrational cutaneous stimuli elicited excitation, 35 neurones were excited by the vibratory stimulation, none was depressed and 4 showed the biphasic response. On the other hand, when the probe was positioned outside the receptive field for low intensity stimuli, 7 WDR neurones were excited, 164 showed depression or the biphasic response and 7 were unaffected. On-going activity and activity evoked by iontophoretic application of glutamate were decreased during the depressant response and during the depressant phase of the biphasic response. In terms of non-nociceptive neurones, all (n = 30) were excited by vibration; depressant or biphasic responses were not observed. Excitation was elicited by placing the probe either inside or outside the receptive field for non-vibrational stimuli. All nociceptive specific neurones (n = 3) were depressed by vibration regardless of the position of the stimulus. All proprioceptive neurones (n = 12) were excited by vibration. The predominantly depressant effect of vibration on nociceptive neurones vs. the predominantly excitatory effect on non-nociceptive neurones prompts us to suggest that the increase in pain threshold and the clinical analgesia elicited by vibration may be mediated at the spinal level by a decrease in the rate of firing of nociceptive neurones and/or by excitation of non-nociceptive neurones.\r"

The nociceptive responses of these neurons elicited by peripheral nerve stimulation were significantly inhibited by stimulation of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) at low intensity without any noticeable cardiovascular reaction. As usual, the late response or C-response was found to be preferentially inhibited by NTS stimulation as compared with the early response or A-response. The effective current intensity for NTS stimulation-produced inhibition ranged from 80 microA to 200 microA. Stronger inhibition was induced when the stimulating site was within or in the immediate vicinity of the NTS. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of the NTS stimulation-produced inhibition of nociceptive response between dorsal horn neurons and lamina X neurons. A similar inhibitory effect was elicited by microinjection of monosodium glutamate into the NTS area. The results demonstrate that the NTS may be involved in the control of nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level.\r"

Rats were chronically implanted with catheters in the lumbar subarachnoid space. Antinociception was evaluated in conscious rats with the tail-flick test. Increasing tizanidine doses produced increases in analgesic efficacy, with 25 micrograms producing a significant long-lasting antinociception. This tail-flick analgesia was very similar to that produced by clonidine (25 micrograms) and morphine (8 micrograms) in peak effect and duration. Doses as high as 250 micrograms produced only a transient hind limb motor dysfunction in 43% of the animals. Daily injections of 25 micrograms tizanidine over 5 days produced a decrease in antinociception, with the peak effect at day 5 at 59% of that at day 1. Blood pressure, in rats lightly anesthetized with halothane, was not affected by tizanidine injections up to 250 micrograms. Tizanidine appears to be a promising non-opiate analgesic for intrathecal usage.\r"

Intrathecal catheters were placed in 69 rats under halothane/N2O anaesthesia. After recovery, baseline hot plate and tail flick latencies were measured, and a dose of opioid was given. Hot plate and tail flick latencies were assessed at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min and then hourly until they returned to within 25% of baseline. Response latencies were converted to per cent of maximum possible effect (% MPE) and the area under the % MPE X time curve was taken as the response. This measure includes information about both potency and duration of action. Each rat received 3 opioids and saline at intervals of 2-3 days. On a fifth occasion, the animal's first treatment was repeated. Each opioid was studied over an 8-fold dose range. Results of both hot plate and tail flick were best described by a model including log(dose), a component due to development of tolerance over the 5 experimental days, and an among-rat variation term. In the hot plate test, doses equieffective in producing a response (AUC) over the dose range studied were in the order OHM less than OM less than HM less than M less than F less than DM less than HC less than OC. Slopes of the log(dose)-response curves were similar for all drugs except OHM, which had a steeper slope. A model is proposed in which hot plate and tail flick latencies are prolonged while CSF concentrations of a drug are above its minimum effective concentration, and drug is cleared from the CSF by a first-order process, possibly uptake into the spinal cord and removal via the blood. This model predicts that log(dose)-response curves will be linear, as was observed, with slopes inversely proportional to the rate constant for clearance from CSF. According to this model the steeper slope of the OHM log(dose)-response may be interpreted as indicating slower clearance from CSF. OHM has the lowest octanol/pH 7.4 buffer distribution coefficient (0.34) of all opioids studied, possibly leading to a lower rate of uptake into the spinal cord.\r"

Immunoaffinity capture of virus, synthesis of viral cDNA, and amplification of cDNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were carried out sequentially in a single reaction vessel. This approach simplified sample preparation and enhanced the specificity of conventional PCR. AC/PCR detected less than one cell culture infectious unit of virus in 80 microliters of sample. Sequencing of AC/PCR reaction products from 34 virus strains demonstrated remarkable conservation at the nucleotide level among most strains but revealed hitherto unsuspected genetic diversity among human isolates. Epidemiologically related strains were identical or closely related in sequence. Virus strains recovered from epidemics of hepatitis A in the United States and Germany were identical in sequence, providing evidence for a previously unrecognized epidemiologic link between these outbreaks.\r"

The fast IK was preferentially expressed in cultures from animals at estrus, whereas the intermediate IK was more frequent in cells from rats at diestrus. These results indicate that K+ channels from myometrial cells are multiregulated.

A chimeric receptor consisting of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) into which the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the alpha 1AR had been placed activated phosphatidylinositol metabolism as effectively as the native alpha 1AR, as did a truncated alpha 1AR lacking the last 47 residues in its cytoplasmic tail. Substitutions of beta 2AR amino acid sequence in the intermediate portions of the third cytoplasmic loop of the alpha 1AR or at the N-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic tail caused marked decreases in receptor coupling to phospholipase C. Conservative substitutions of two residues in the C terminus of the third cytoplasmic loop (Ala293----Leu, Lys290----His) increased the potency of agonists for stimulating phosphatidylinositol metabolism by up to 2 orders of magnitude. These data indicate (i) that the regions of the alpha 1AR that determine coupling to phosphatidylinositol metabolism are similar to those previously shown to be involved in coupling of beta 2AR to adenylate cyclase stimulation and (ii) that point mutations of a G-protein-coupled receptor can cause remarkable increases in sensitivity of biological response.\r"

The target antigens against which such CTL responses are directed are yet undefined, but the antigens probably derived from one or more of the EBV \"latent\" proteins constitutively expressed in virus-transformed B cells. We have analyzed target specificity of CTL responses from two EBV-immune donors that are preferentially reactive against autologous cells transformed with type A but not with type B virus isolates. Coding sequences for four EBV latent proteins with allelic polymorphism between A and B virus types--namely, the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) EBNA 2, EBNA 3a, EBNA 3c, and EBNA leader protein--have been introduced into vaccinia virus vectors under control of vaccinia promoter P7.5 and used to express relevant EBNA proteins in appropriate target cells. Thus the CTL response from one donor has been mapped to type A EBNA 2 protein and from a second donor to type A EBNA 3a protein. Thereafter, a series of recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed that carried specific internal deletions within the EBNA 2 type A coding sequence; by using these vectors, the above EBNA 2 type A-specific CTL response was shown to be directed against an epitope within a 100-amino acid fragment near the N terminus of the protein. This work clearly shows human CTL recognition of virus-coded nuclear antigens in the EBV system; moreover, it establishes an experimental approach that can be extended to all EBV latent proteins and to the more common CTL responses that cross-react against type A and type B virus isolates.\r"

Short-latency activation of the giant axons is triggered by light-flash stimulation that elicits a stereotyped startle-escape response and powerful jet. Many other types of stimuli produce a highly variable, delayed-escape response with strong jetting primarily controlled by a small axon motor pathway. In such cases, activation of the giant axons is not necessary for a vigorous escape jet. When they are utilized, the giant axons are not activated until well after the non-giant system initiates the escape response, and excitation is critically timed to boost the rise in intramantle pressure. Squid thus show at least two escape modes in which the giant axons can contribute in different ways to the control of a highly flexible behavior.\r"

The vectors employed were replication-deficient and dependent on complementation by a helper virus provided by the irradiated packaging lines. After cocultivation with the relevant packaging cell lines, stable hybridoma lines expressing the selectable markers were easily obtained and were then suitable for conventional somatic fusion. This high-efficiency method was used to generate two bispecific monoclonal antibodies simultaneously targeting molecules expressed on cytotoxic cells (i.e., T lymphocytes and natural killer cells) against a human melanoma-associated antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) satellite RNAs, which induce necrosis on tomatoes, reveals a highly conserved region within their 3' halves. The sequence of WL1 satellite (WL1-sat) RNA, which attenuates CMV symptoms on tomatoes, differs from all necrogenic satellite RNAs at three nucleotide positions within this conserved region. These nucleotides were progressively mutated to determine what sequence is required for the induction of necrosis in tomatoes. Infectious transcripts from a cDNA clone of WL1-sat RNA, and its mutated derivatives, were assayed on tomato. Three of the four mutant satellite RNAs, in which two of the three nucleotides correspond to those present in necrogenic satellite RNAs, and the rest of the molecule corresponded to WL1-sat RNA, attenuated CMV symptoms on tomatoes, and were phenotypically identical to the parental WL1-sat RNA. One other mutant satellite RNA, in which all three mutated nucleotides corresponded to the sequence of necrogenic satellite RNAs and the rest of the molecule corresponded to WL1-sat RNA, induced a lethal necrosis on tomatoes. Necrosis was also observed when the same mutant satellite RNA was associated with a second CMV strain as helper virus. These results indicate that a single nucleotide change at any of the three nucleotides examined distinguishes necrogenic from nonnecrogenic satellite RNAs. This necrosis was similar to that induced by a naturally necrogenic satellite RNA. The various mutations did not modify the effect of WL1-sat RNA on the symptoms induced by CMV on tobacco or squash.\r"

The amount and kinetics of formation of these elements have been correlated with the level and time course of overall DHFR gene amplification. The amplisomes account for the great majority and possibly the totality of the amplified DHFR genes in 10B3 cells. They appear very early during the development of methotrexate resistance and increase in parallel with the amplified genes. These observations suggest that these elements are involved in an early event, possibly the first event, of gene amplification in this system. Amplisomes tend to be lost from 10B3 cells in the absence of selective pressure, although much more slowly than expected from simple dilution of nonreplicating elements. Surprisingly, under selective pressure, these elements have shown no tendency to become integrated into chromosomes or to generate minute chromosomes over a period of almost 1 year, in contrast to what has been described in other systems.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism and site(s) of action of volatile anesthetics are unknown. In all organisms studied, volatile anesthetics adhere to the Meyer-Overton relationship--that is, a ln-ln plot of the oil-gas partition coefficients versus the potencies yields a straight line with a slope of -1. This relationship has led to two conclusions about the site of action of volatile anesthetics. (i) It has properties similar to the lipid used to determine the oil-gas partition coefficients. (ii) All volatile anesthetics cause anesthesia by affecting a single site. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we have identified two mutants with altered sensitivities to only some volatile anesthetics. These two mutants, unc-79 and unc-80, confer large increases in sensitivity to very lipid soluble agents but have little or no increases to other agents. In addition, a class of extragenic suppressor mutations exists that suppresses some altered sensitivities but specifically does not suppress the altered sensitivity to diethyl ether. There is much debate concerning the molecular nature of the site(s) of anesthetic action. One point of discussion is whether the site(s) consists of a purely lipid binding site or if protein is involved. The simplest explanation of our observations is that volatile anesthetics cause immobility in C. elegans by specifically interacting with multiple sites. This model is in turn more consistent with involvement of protein at the site(s) of action.\r"

  ".U": "90222151\r", 
  ".W": "The X gene of wild-type hepatitis B virus or integrated DNA has recently been shown to stimulate transcription of a variety of enhancers and promoters. To further delineate the viral sequences responsible for trans-activation in hepatomas, we cloned the single hepatitis B virus insert from human hepatocellular carcinoma DNA M1. The plasmid pM1 contains 2004 base pairs of hepatitis B virus DNA subtype adr, including truncated preS/S sequences and the enhancer element. The X promoter and 422 nucleotides of the X coding region are present. The entire preC/C gene is deleted. In transient cotransfection assays using Chang liver cells (CCL 13), pM1 DNA exerts a 6- to 10-fold trans-activating effect on the expression of the pSV2CAT reporter plasmid. The trans-activation occurs by stimulation of transcription and is dependent on the simian virus 40 enhancer in the reporter plasmid. Deletion analysis of pM1 subclones reveals that the trans-activator is encoded by preS/S and not by X sequences. A frameshift mutation within the preS2 open reading frame shows that this portion is indispensable for the trans-activating function. Initiation of transcription has been mapped to the S1 promoter. A comparable trans-activating effect is also observed with cloned wild-type hepatitis B virus sequences similarly truncated. These results show that a transcriptional trans-activator function not present in the intact gene is generated by 3' truncation of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA preS/S sequences.\r"

  ".U": "90222154\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary surfactant contains two hydrophobic polypeptides, SP-B and SP-C, with known amino acid sequences and with truncated subforms lacking the N-terminal residues. Treatment of SP-C with KOH releases fatty acids (palmitic acid to more than 85%) in molar ratios of 1.8-2.0 relative to the polypeptide. Furthermore, plasma-desorption mass spectrometry shows native SP-C of both the intact and truncated types to be monomers with masses about 500 units higher than those expected for the polypeptide chains. After treatment with KOH, trimethylamine, or dithioerythritol, the polypeptide masses are obtained. These results prove that native SP-C is a lipopeptide with two palmitoyl groups covalently linked to the polypeptide chain. The deacylation conditions, the presence of two cysteine residues in the polypeptide, and the absence of other possible attachment sites establish that the palmitoyl groups are thioester-linked to the two adjacent cysteine residues. In contrast, the major form of porcine SP-B is a dimer without fatty acid components. That SP-C is a true lipopeptide with covalently bound palmitoyl groups suggests possibilities for functional interactions. It gives a direct physical link between SP-C and surfactant phospholipid components. Long-chain acylation may constitute a means for association of proteins with membranes and could conceivably modulate the stability and biological activity of surfactant films.\r"

A leading theory for the third step involves ferric peroxide attack on the 19-oxo group to produce a 19,19-hydroxyferric peroxide intermediate and subsequent collapse to estrogen. We had previously developed a nonenzymatic peroxide model reaction which was based on the above-mentioned theory, and we demonstrated the importance of 3-ketone enolization in facilitating aromatization. This study discusses the synthesis and nonenzymatic and enzymatic study of a 3-desoxy-2,4-diene-19-oxo androgen analogue. This compound was found to be a potent nonenzymatic model substrate and competitive inhibitor of aromatase (Ki = 73 nM). Furthermore, in an unprecedented event, this compound served as a substrate for aromatase, with conversion to the corresponding 3-desoxyestrogen.\r"

  ".U": "90222159\r", 
  ".W": "The calcium-dependent proteolysis of fodrin has been implicated in the regulation of secretion, neutrophil and platelet activation, and long-term potentiation in neurons. In vitro studies indicate that calcium-dependent protease I (calpain I) cleaves fodrin in the middle of the alpha subunit and in the COOH-terminal third of the beta subunit. Cleavage at the beta site requires calmodulin, which binds with high affinity to a single site in the alpha subunit. In vitro binding assays, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and velocity sedimentation identify a linkage between calcium-dependent protease I proteolysis of fodrin and the ability of calmodulin to regulate the self-association of fodrin and its interaction with actin. Three functional states appear to exist: (i) intact fodrin, which constitutively forms tetramers and binds F-actin; (ii) alpha-cleaved fodrin, which loses its ability to self-associate and bind F-actin in the presence of calmodulin; and (iii) alpha,beta-cleaved fodrin, a form that is incompetent to establish tetramers or bind actin. Because actin binding and fodrin self-association occur at opposite ends of the molecule, whereas calmodulin binds at its center, these results indicate that long-range interactions exist within fodrin. They also offer an example of how two calcium-dependent regulatory processes may act synergistically to reversibly regulate a linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton.\r"

Implantation of OIF plus transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) type 1 or 2 into subcutaneous tissues of rats induces formation of bone at the implantation site. Since TGF-beta is also present in bone matrix and inhibits formation of multinucleated cells that express an osteoclast phenotype in long-term human marrow cultures, we tested the effects of OIF on formation of these osteoclast-like cells to determine the effects of OIF on cells in the osteoclast lineage. We found that OIF inhibited total multinucleated cell (MNC) formation in a dose-dependent fashion and preferentially inhibited formation of MNCs that react with monoclonal antibody 23c6 (23c6-positive MNCs), an antibody that identifies osteoclasts. In addition, low concentrations of OIF in combination with low concentrations of TGF-beta acted synergistically to inhibit 23c6-positive MNC formation. The inhibition of 23c6-positive MNC formation by OIF was not mediated by prostaglandin synthesis. These data suggest that regulatory growth factors, such as OIF or TGF-beta, that are stored within the bone matrix and released when bone is resorbed can serve as natural inhibitors of osteoclast activity by inhibiting osteoclast formation.\r"

Recent studies suggest that decreased nerve growth factor responsiveness of basal forebrain neurons is a feature of normal aging and of Alzheimer disease. We have used in situ hybridization to show that the abundance of specific forms of APP mRNA, which contain an inserted Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor motif (APP-751, APP-770, and APP-related 563), are increased relative to the noninserted form (APP-695) of APP mRNA in the basal forebrain of aged rats. This increase appears to be specific to animals who exhibit spatial memory deficits but not aged rats without behavioral impairments.\r"

Identity was further confirmed by cleavage of the isolated product with gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to yield the corresponding cysteinylglycinyl conjugate that was identical by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis with the enzymic cleavage product derived from the synthetic glutathionyl conjugate. The glutathionyl and cysteinylglycinyl conjugate are referred to as hepoxilin A3-C and hepoxilin A3-D, respectively, by analogy with the established leukotriene nomenclature. Formation of hepoxilin A3-C was greatly enhanced with a concomitant decrease in formation of the epoxide hydrolase product, trioxilin A3, when the epoxide hydrolase inhibitor trichloropropene oxide was added to the incubation mixture demonstrating the presence of a dual metabolic pathway in this tissue involving hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferase processes. Hepoxilin A3-C was tested using intracellular electrophysiological techniques on hippocampal CA1 neurons and found to be active at concentrations as low as 16 nM in causing membrane hyperpolarization, enhanced amplitude and duration of the post-spike train afterhyperpolarization, a marked increase in the inhibitory postsynaptic potential, and a decrease in the spike threshold. These findings suggest that these products in the hepoxilin pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism formed by the rat brain may function as neuromodulators.\r"

The use of template deleted of its upstream region resulted in poor transcriptional efficiency, as did the use of extracts prepared from rooster liver, in which the gene is silent. The influence of individual cis elements was determined by transcription competition analysis. Oligonucleotides covering greater than 500 base pairs of the promoter region were used as competitor DNA in the in vitro reactions. Competition with an oligonucleotide covering part of the expression-specific DNase I hypersensitivity site B2, which contains a demethylation site, mCpG, at nucleotide position + 10, increased transcription of the gene, suggesting the binding of a repressor to this region. The enhancement of transcription was even more pronounced when the same oligonucleotide was methylated at the corresponding + 10 cytosine. Competition with oligonucleotides covering the TATA box, or the estrogen response element half-palindromic motif (GGTCA) at nucleotide positions -198 to -194, resulted in a large decrease in vitellogenin gene transcription, indicating that strongly activating factors bind to these regions. Competing oligonucleotides covering other GGTCA-containing motifs situated further upstream at nucleotide positions -292 to -288, -367 to -351, and -626 to -614 were increasingly less effective in inhibiting transcription. The results indicate that factors other than the estrogen receptor are involved in transcriptional activation of the vitellogenin II gene.\r"

To examine cellular behavior relevant to this process, human trophoblasts were cultured on (i) Millicell filters prelayered with Matrigel and (ii) coverslips precoated with a gentle slope of Matrigel (Matribeach). Histologic sections of the Millicell system demonstrated significant invasion. However, on Matribeach the cells exhibited markedly different characteristics depending on the thickness of the Matrigel. On zone 1 (1-4 microns thick), flat aggregates and syncytia were seen. In contrast, cells on zone 2 (4-14 microns) formed rounded aggregates with intercellular processes. In this zone, prominent degradation of pericellular Matrigel proteins was assessed by both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP inhibited this proteolytic process. On zone 3 (14-60 microns), unicellular trophoblasts or small aggregates caused minimal matrix degradation. JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells exhibited similar morphologic and degradative properties on Matribeach, but zone 2 proteolysis was not affected by 8-bromo-cAMP. Our results suggest that extracellular matrix thickness has profound effects on cellular morphology and proteolytic activity. Furthermore, while both normal and malignant human trophoblasts can degrade extracellular matrix proteins, only normal trophoblast extracellular matrix degradation is inhibited by 8-bromo-cAMP.\r"

It has been suggested that alpha beta T cells are generated only from precursor T cells that failed to rearrange gamma and delta genes in a functional form. However, we found that transgenic mice constructed with functionally rearranged gamma and delta genes produce a normal number of alpha beta T cells. The transgene gamma present in these alpha beta T cells is repressed apparently through an associated cis DNA element (silencer). We propose that some T-cell precursors are committed to generate alpha beta T cells independent of the rearrangement status of their gamma gene and that this commitment involves activation of a factor(s) that interacts with the gamma gene-associated silencer.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebellar degeneration-related antigen (designated CDR34) was previously cloned by antibody screening of a cDNA library and was shown to be one of the target molecules recognized by autoantibodies in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. This molecule is distinctive in that it contains a tandem hexapeptide repetitive structure, presumably the basis for its high immunogenicity. In this study, we cloned the human CDR34 gene and proved that the entire repetitive sequence is encoded by a single exon without introns. We also showed that the nucleotide repeats are preserved only in the protein-coding sequences, suggesting evolutionary constraint in this region of the gene. Corresponding mouse cDNA clones were also isolated, which encoded a larger molecule with very similar hexapeptide repeating units. Comparison of the human and mouse repeats revealed a highly conserved Glu-Asp core in each unit, implicating the functional significance of this motif. Chromosomal mapping by somatic cell hybrid analysis mapped CDR34 to both human and mouse chromosomes X, and in situ hybridization further assigned CDR34 to human Xq24-q27.\r"

In the latter system PMEA has stronger antiretroviral potency and selectivity than 3'-azido-3'-thymidine (AZT). We have now investigated the effect of the drug in cats infected with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In vitro, PMEA was found to efficiently block FIV replication in feline thymocytes (50% effective dose, 0.6 microM). When administered to cats at doses of 20, 5, or 2 mg/kg per day, PMEA caused a dose-dependent suppression of FIV replication and virus-specific antibody production. Seropositive field cats with signs of opportunistic infection (gingivitis, stomatitis, and diarrhea) showed clinical improvement during PMEA therapy (5 mg/kg per day) and recurrence of the disease after treatment was discontinued. Thus, FIV infection in cats is an excellent model to test the efficacy of selective anti-human immunodeficiency virus agents in vivo.\r"

Here we show that IL-6 mRNA is produced in vivo in two self-limiting physiologic angiogenic processes: (i) the formation of the vascular system accompanying development of ovarian follicles and (ii) the formation of a capillary network in the maternal decidua following embryonic implantation. In situ and RNA blot hybridization analyses detected transient expression of IL-6 mRNA in gonadotropin-primed hyperstimulated ovaries, with maximal mRNA levels coinciding with the period of formation of a capillary network around follicles. Expression of IL-6 mRNA was detected in the vasculature extending from the ovarian medulla to the forming capillary sheath in the thecal layer of individual growing follicles. No expression was detected in more-developed preovulatory follicles once angiogenesis had been completed. IL-6 mRNA was also detected in the uterus of pregnant mice 9.5 days postcoitum, and there was no appreciable IL-6 mRNA at later stages of embryonic development. Expression in the uterus was confined to cords of endothelial cells in the process of formation of an anastomosing network that traversed the maternal decidua towards the developing embryo. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in two independent physiological angiogenic processes and the transient nature of its expression in endothelial cells suggest a role for IL-6 in angiogenesis.\r"

We have isolated a cDNA clone (pRNG alpha 2) encoding a rat alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. A rat kidney cDNA library was screened with an oligonucleotide complementary to a highly conserved region found in all biogenic amine receptors described to date. The deduced amino acid sequence displays many features of guanyl nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors except it does not have a consensus N-linked glycosylation site near the amino terminus. Membranes prepared from COS cells transfected with pRNG alpha 2 DNA display high affinity and saturable binding to [3H]rauwolscine (Kd = 2 nM). Competition curve data analysis shows that RNG alpha 2 protein binds to a variety of adrenergic drugs with the following rank order of potency: yohimbine greater than or equal to chlorpromazine greater than or equal to prazosin greater than or equal to clonidine greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to oxymetazoline. RNG alpha 2 RNA accumulates in both rat kidney and neonatal rat lung (predominant species is 4000 nucleotides). When a cysteine residue (Cys-169) that is conserved among all members of the seven-transmembrane-region superfamily is changed to phenylalanine, the RNG alpha 2 protein fails to bind [3H]rauwolscine after expression in COS cells. We conclude that pRNG alpha 2 likely represents a cDNA for a rat alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor.\r"

Activities of CK ranging from 80-250 mumol per min per g (wet weight) were detected in liver extracts from five founder mice. The CK activity was stably transmitted to subsequent generations. Isozyme gels and immunoblots confirmed that the activity detected in extracts was due to the B isozyme of CK. Immunohistology indicated that the protein was expressed uniformly throughout the liver and was localized primarily to the cytoplasm. 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to detect the metabolic product of the CK reaction, phosphocreatine, demonstrating that the enzyme was active in vivo. The phosphocreatine level fell rapidly during anoxia (t1/2 = 1 min), indicating that the CK reaction was integrated into hepatic energy metabolism. The equilibrium established by CK was used to calculate a hepatic free ADP level of 0.059 +/- 0.004 mumol/g (wet weight). In vivo NMR studies of these mice will be valuable for studying the role of free ADP in regulating liver metabolism.\r"

Previous studies in our laboratory indicated a 50% deficiency of spectrin and an absence of normal ankyrin in erythrocyte membranes of nb/nb mice. We now report genetic mapping data that localize both the nb and erythroid ankyrin (Ank-1) loci to the centromeric end of mouse chromosome 8. Using immunological and biochemical methods, we have further characterized the nature of the ankyrin defect in mutant erythrocytes. We do not detect normal sized (210 kDa) erythroid ankyrin by immunoblot analysis in nb/nb reticulocytes. However, nb/nb reticulocytes do contain a 150-kDa ankyrin immunoreactive protein. The 150-kDa protein is present with normal-sized ankyrin in nb/+ reticulocytes but is not found in +/+ reticulocytes. Our genetic and biochemical data indicate that the nb mutation results from a defect in the erythroid ankyrin gene. A human hereditary spherocytosis putatively resulting from an ankyrin defect maps to a segment of human chromosome 8 that is homologous to the nb-ankyrin region of mouse chromosome 8. The linkage data suggest that the mouse and human diseases result from mutations in homologous loci.\r"

By using the polymerase chain reaction, we now show that the affected monkeys are heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in exon 6 of the LDLR gene. This mutation changes the sequence of the codon for amino acid 284 (tryptophan) from TGG to TAG, thereby generating a nonsense codon potentially resulting in a truncated 283-amino acid protein, which needs documentation, however. This G----A mutation also creates a site for the restriction endonuclease Spe I. Using this site as a marker for this nonsense mutation, we have shown that the mutation is present in all of the affected members of the pedigree and absent in unaffected members and that the mutation segregates with the phenotype of spontaneous hypercholesterolemia through three generations. Quantitative analyses of RNA obtained from liver biopsies show that the abundance of the LDLR RNA is also reduced by about 50%. Thus, we have identified a primate model for human familial hypercholesterolemia which will be useful for studying the relationship between the LDLR and lipoprotein metabolism and for assessing the efficacy of diets and drugs in the treatment of human familial hypercholesterolemia.\r"

We have prepared two sets of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against TNF-binding proteins from the HL-60 (htr-mAb series) and U-937 (utr-mAb series) cell lines. The htr antibodies inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled TNF-alpha to HL-60 cells only partially, whereas they block the TNF-alpha binding to several adenocarcinoma cell lines (HEp-2, HeLa, and MCF7) almost completely. In contrast, the utr antibodies have no effect on TNF-alpha binding to the adenocarcinoma cell lines but partially inhibit TNF-alpha binding to HL-60 and U-937 cells. However, htr-9 and utr-1 antibodies in combination fully inhibit the TNF-alpha binding to HL-60 and U-937 cells. The binding of TNF-beta to HEp-2 and U-937 cells is also inhibited by htr and utr antibodies. Neither htr nor utr mAb has an effect on the TNF-sensitive murine cell lines L929 and WEHI 164. Flow cytometry studies show that mAbs htr-9 and utr-1 detect two distinct TNF-binding sites on human cell lines. Immunologic blot and immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that mAbs htr-9 and utr-1 recognize proteins of approximately 55 kDa and 75 kDa, respectively. These data provide evidence for the existence of two distinct TNF receptor molecules that contribute to varying extent to the TNF binding by different human cells.\r"

This phenomenon is known to contribute to the generation of drug-resistant tumor cells and quantitation of the event is believed to have prognostic value in several types of neoplasias. To date, most studies of gene amplification have used immortalized cell lines and biopsied tumor samples. In this study I examine the amplification potentials of primary diploid cells, both human and rodent, and quantitatively compare them to the amplification potentials of their transformed counterparts. I have used a strictly defined protocol (i.e., selection at a stringency of 9 X LD50) to measure amplification potential at two loci, the gene for the multifunctional protein containing activities for carbamoyl phosphate synthase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) and the gene for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). I find that the frequency of amplification in transformed cells is at least four orders of magnitude greater than that in normal cells. Out of 29 cell populations studied, the 7 diploid normal cell populations exhibited no detectable amplification frequency (limit of detection at 10(-8) whereas the 22 transformed cell lines demonstrated amplification frequencies between 10(-3) and 10(-7). These results demonstrate that a dramatic difference exists between primary diploid cell populations and immortalized cell populations in their ability to amplify genomic sequences and suggests a significant difference in genetic stability between these two cell types.\r"

We have evaluated the effects of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha as well as extracellular zinc and glucocorticoid hormone on metallothionein gene expression and cellular zinc accumulation in rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures. Further, we have evaluated the teleological basis for cytokine mediation by examining cytoprotection from CCl4-induced damage. Incubation of hepatocytes with IL-6 led to concentration-dependent and time-dependent increases in metallothionein-1 and -2 mRNA and metallothionein protein. The level of each was increased within 3 hr after the addition of IL-6 at 10 ng/ml (10 hepatocyte-stimulating factor units/ml). Maximal increases in metallothionein mRNA and metallothionein protein were achieved after 12 hr and 36 hr, respectively. In contrast, IL-1 alpha concentrations as high as 20 ng/ml (1000 lymphocyte-activating factor units/ml) had no effect. Concomitant with the up-regulation of metallothionein gene expression, IL-6 also increased cellular zinc. Responses to IL-6 required the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone and were optimized by increased extracellular zinc. In addition, IL-6 with dexamethasone, dexamethasone alone, and increased extracellular zinc each reversed, in decreasing potency, the deleterious effects of CCl4 on hepatocyte viability as measured by cell protein and lactate dehydrogenase activity of the medium. Thus, IL-6 is a major cytokine mediator of metallothionein gene expression and zinc metabolism in hepatocytes and provides cytoprotection from CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity via a mode consistent with dependence upon increased cellular metallothionein synthesis and zinc accumulation.\r"

  ".U": "90222185\r", 
  ".W": "A major contribution to the binding free energy associated with most protein-nucleic acid complexes is the increase in entropy due to counterion release from the nucleic acid that results from electrostatic interactions. To examine this quantitatively, we have measured the thermodynamic extent of counterion release that results from the interaction between single-stranded homopolynucleotides and a series of oligolysines, possessing net charges z = 2-6, 8, and 10. This was accomplished by measuring the salt dependence of the intrinsic equilibrium binding constants--i.e., (delta log Kobs/delta log[K+])--over the range from 6 mM to 0.5 M potassium acetate. These data provide a rigorous test of linear polyelectrolyte theories that have been used to interpret the effects of changes in bulk salt concentration on protein-DNA binding equilibria, since single-stranded nucleic acids have a lower axial charge density than duplex DNA. Upon binding to poly(U), the thermodynamic extent of counterion release per oligolysine charge, z, is 0.71 +/- 0.03, which is significantly less than unity and less than that measured upon binding duplex DNA. These results are most simply interpreted using the limiting law predictions of counterion condensation and cylindrical Poisson-Boltzmann theories, even at the high salt concentrations used in our experiments. Accurate estimates of the thermodynamic extent of counterion binding and release for model systems such as these facilitate our understanding of the energetics of protein-nucleic acid interactions. These data indicate that for simple oligovalent cations, the number of ionic interactions formed in a complex with a linear nucleic acid can be accurately estimated from a measure of the salt dependence of the equilibrium binding constant, if the thermodynamic extent of ion release is known.\r"

Previous studies on primary fibroblast cell lines from patients with methylmalonic acidemia have delineated a variety of biochemical phenotypes underlying this disorder. One cell line with primary mutase apoenzyme deficiency exhibited a particularly unusual phenotype; it expressed an abnormally small and unstable immunoreactive protein, which was not imported by mitochondria. We now report cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding this mutant protein. The mutation is a single base change, a cytosine----thymine transition, which introduces an amber termination codon at position 17 within the mitochondrial leader sequence. The immunoreactive protein produced by these cells reflects translation from AUG codons downstream from this termination codon and, hence, lacks a mitochondrial leader peptide. This mutation represents a complex prototype for a class of mutations in which absence of the mitochondrial targeting sequence leads to absence of a functioning gene product.\r"

  ".W": "An epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb), mAb LA22, was used to analyze the covalent coupling of human EGF receptors to mouse EGF by the amine-reactive cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate. A soluble Mr 105,000 truncated form of the receptor secreted by A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and consisting of the ligand-binding extracellular domain was cross-linked to 125I-labeled EGF. Digestion of this complex with an endoproteinase that specifically cleaves at the COOH side of glutamyl residue released a single radiolabeled glycosylated fragment of Mr 18,000 that reacted with mAb LA22. As the epitope for mAb LA22 resided between Ala-351 and Asp-364 of the mature receptor, this result localized the cross-linked receptor residue(s) to the 47-amino acid interval from Phe-321 to Glu-367. The receptor residue(s) involved in the covalent coupling of rat 125I-labeled transforming growth factor alpha was similarly localized to this region of the receptor. This receptor interval, which included two glycosylated asparaginyl residues at positions 328 and 337, contained but three amino acid residues that were potentially reactive with disuccinimidyl suberate: Lys-332, Lys-333, and Lys-336. Characterization of mAb LA22-reactive 125I-EGF-labeled receptor fragments generated by an endoproteinase specific for the COOH side of lysyl residue placed the NH2 termini of the two smallest fragments between the glycosylated residues Asn-328 and Asn-337. These results indicated that disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked the NH2 group of EGF residue Asn-1 to the human EGF receptor residue Lys-336. Our results further suggest that EGF and transforming growth factor alpha, two members of the EGF family of peptide growth factors, interact with closely apposed or identical features of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "We cloned the t(10;14) recurrent translocation from CD3-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The breakpoint at 14q11 involved an intermediate rearrangement of the delta T-cell receptor locus, suggesting that the translocation arose at the time of antigen receptor assemblage. Translocation introduced chromosome segment 10q24 as proven by hybridization of a breakpoint-derived probe to flow-sorted chromosomes and metaphase chromosomes. Two t(10;14) breakpoints were clustered within a 600-base-pair region of 10q24 but no heptamer-spacer-nonamer motifs resembling T-cell receptor/immunoglobulin rearrangement signals were noted at the breakpoint. A locus distinct from terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was found at 10q24. Evolutionarily conserved regions surrounding the 10q24 breakpoint were examined for transcriptional activity. A region telomeric to the 10q24 breakpoint, expected to translocate to the der(14) chromosome, recognized an abundant 2.9-kilobase RNA in a t(10;14) T-cell leukemia. This locus was not active in a variety of other normal and neoplastic T cells, arguing that it was deregulated by the introduction of the T-cell receptor. This locus is a candidate for a putative protooncogene, TCL3, involved in T-cell neoplasia.\r"
