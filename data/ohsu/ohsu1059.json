A principal abnormality causing venous insufficiency is deep venous reflux, usually resulting from post-thrombotic valve destruction. Patients undergoing treatment for venous insufficiency should have all venous abnormalities investigated, defined and corrected where possible. Although treatment for superficial and communicating vein incompetence is available, correction of deep vein reflux has been neglected until recently. Deep vein valve physiology, the selection of patients for deep vein valve surgery and methods of valve repair and replacement are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Of 309 questionnaires on carotid endarterectomy sent to all surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland who might use this technique, 298 (96 per cent) were returned. In all, 110 (37 per cent) of 298 surgeons performed at least one carotid endarterectomy in 1989; 67 performed less than 10 and 43 greater than 10. In total, these 110 surgeons performed 1417 operations in 1989, a situation that has changed little over 5 years since the previous survey. Transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke remain the main indications for carotid endarterectomy; the operation was hardly ever performed for asymptomatic stenosis. By 1989 almost all surgeons initially assessed prospective patients using a technique less invasive than conventional angiography; duplex scanning was used 'always' or 'sometimes' by 70 per cent of surgeons. While 72 per cent of surgeons in 1984 'always' required conventional angiograms before operation, by 1989 only 21 per cent did so, most now relying on less invasive techniques. During operation there was an increasing use of shunts, carotid sinus nerve blockade and patch closure of the arteriotomy. The overall number of carotid endarterectomies performed annually in Great Britain and Ireland has remained steady over the past 5 years and is relatively low for a population of 60 millions. An increase in the number of surgeons performing the operation is almost entirely accounted for by an increase in those performing less than 10 carotid endarterectomies per year.\r"

The risk of all types of fatal aneurysm was substantially increased for current smokers of manufactured cigarettes (rate ratio compared with lifelong non-smokers = 6.5; 95 per cent confidence interval 2.3-18.7), pipe or cigars (6.7; 1.7-26.5) and hand-rolled cigarettes (25.0; 7.5-83.3). Diastolic blood pressure was strongly associated with dissecting aneurysm (rate ratio per 10 mmHg increase = 2.4; 95 per cent confidence interval 1.7-3.2) and abdominal aneurysm (1.5; 1.2-1.9) but not other aneurysms (1.0; 0.7-1.5). The independent effects of height, adiposity, plasma cholesterol, glucose intolerance, reported angina and intermittent claudication were not significant. Hypertension and smoking, particularly of hand-rolled cigarettes, are confirmed as major and potentially remediable risk factors for fatal aortic aneurysm.\r"

Oxygen consumption was measured in the calf by calculating the rate of conversion of oxyhaemoglobin to deoxyhaemoglobin during a period of tourniquet-induced ischaemia. Postischaemic reoxygenation was also measured. Median oxygen consumption in patients with peripheral vascular disease was 0.10 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1, while in the control group it was 0.20 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1 (P less than 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). The median time taken to reach maximum oxyhaemoglobin levels after ischaemia was 40 s in patients with peripheral vascular disease and 20 s in controls (P less than 0.02). The results indicate that oxygen consumption is reduced in peripheral vascular disease. Near infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive method for assessing metabolic improvement resulting from surgical or pharmacological treatment.\r"

In addition, untreated ePTFE and Gelseal were examined. The graft segments, coated with these matrices, were incubated with radiolabelled adult human endothelial cells for 30, 60 and 90 min. Endothelial cell adherence was calculated from the ratio of radioactive counts in the grafts to counts in grafts plus supernatants. Endothelial cell attachment to untreated grafts was poor, but a suitable matrix significantly improved adherence. All three matrices tested gave good results, although preclot was best; 30-60 min incubation was sufficient for optimum cell attachment. Cell adherence to both Dacron and ePTFE was significantly better than to Gelseal. The type of prosthetic polymer and the substrate protein coating used to promote endothelial cell adherence are two important factors which may determine the ultimate success of endothelial seeding in the operating room.\r"

Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy. At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20). When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation. The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups). Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis.\r"

Thirty-two age- and sex-matched consecutive patients under the care of one surgeon were randomized. The median duration of anal dilatation while making the anastomosis was 19 min (range 14-33 min) and 1 min (range 0-39 min) in groups A and B respectively (P less than 0.005). The median level of the anastomosis was at the dentate line (range 0-0.5 cm) in group A and 2 cm above the dentate line (range 0.2-4.0 cm) in group B (P less than 0.005). Seven patients in group A and 11 in group B had at least one postoperative complication (n.s.). One patient in group A and four in group B developed an anastomotic stricture requiring dilatation (n.s.). One patient in group B had the reservoir removed. Function was assessed at a median of 11 months (range 7-15 months) after ileostomy closure in 14 patients in group A, and at a median of 12 months (range 5-17 months) in 14 patients in group B. Median frequency of defaecation per 24 h was 4 in both groups (group A, range 2-7; group B, range 2-10). Night evacuation (greater than once per week) occurred in seven patients in each group. All patients in both groups could delay the desire to defaecate by more than 30 min. Eleven patients in group A and 12 in group B had normal continence. Evidence to date favours a full mucosectomy. Function is not vitiated by this technique and surgical removal of the disease is more complete.\r"

Since the presence of receptors is required for steroid action, specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors (RD3) were investigated in biopsies taken at different levels of the colon. The study involved 90 biopsies from patients operated on for colorectal adenocarcinoma. They were paired biopsies from adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. In addition, 26 normal intestinal mucosa biopsies from patients without cancer were examined. RD3 receptors were assayed in tissue extract by the dextran-coated charcoal technique and also characterized by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of specific high affinity-low capacity sites binding for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The incidence of RD3 was 86 per cent in normal mucosa (n = 77) and lower in carcinoma (n = 34), for which the incidence decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) from right colon (58 per cent) to left colon (37 per cent) and rectum (19 per cent). These data suggest that the normal colon is a potential target organ for 1,25-(OH)2D3 which might modulate calcium transport in the colon. Loss of receptivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is associated with malignant transformation.\r"

We report here our experience of the use of reconstituted connective tissue created from elastin, fibronectin and collagen in preventing anastomosis leakage and closing intestinal fistulas. In animal studies (56 rats), this connective tissue was used as a patch applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic defect. In a clinical evaluation, eight patients had an intestinal fistula closed by a simple sewn suture reinforced by a sealed patch and seven patients had a high risk anastomosis reinforced by a sealed patch, in most cases as an alternative to staged surgery. In animal studies, complete reconstitution of the three colonic layers was obtained without retraction and without inflammatory reaction within 40 days, while the patch was slowly resorbed. In clinical trials all 15 defects and anastomoses healed without complication. Three patients died from other causes and, at autopsy, the patch was found to have remained in place covering the suture line. If these results are confirmed by a prospective clinical trial, such biomaterial offers the possibility of reducing the occurrence of anastomosis leakage, especially in high risk circumstances.\r"

There was no significant difference between the accuracy of consultants and the research fellow. Anal endosonography identified 10 internal openings based on initial criteria. This rose to 24 when revised ultrasonographic criteria were applied. There was no statistical difference between consultant assessment and anal ultrasonography in correctly identifying intersphincteric and transphincteric tracks. Ultrasonography is unable to assess primary superficial, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric tracks or secondary supralevator and infralevator tracks.

  ".W": "Within 36 months of its formation the Northern Region Polyposis Registry had increased the number of identified gene carriers of familial adenomatous polyposis from 56 to 65 in a population of 3.1 million and had achieved a 15-fold increase in the number of at-risk relatives being regularly screened. Review of the surgical records at the outset of the registry revealed that the mean age at diagnosis of those patients detected by screening was 24.7 years, whereas it was 36.6 years for those detected by symptoms. Ten of the 31 in the latter group had colorectal carcinomas whilst only one of those detected by screening had a cancer and a significantly higher proportion had sphincter-saving surgery. A regional registry can provide an effective screening and counselling service to surgeons treating patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. At-risk relatives are best assessed by combining results of the different screening procedures now available but the prime requirement of a successful registry is dedicated domiciliary counselling.\r"

Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture. The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated. Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases. Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery.\r"

  ".W": "From 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1989 123 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 122) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) were screened using liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein determination, ultrasonography with biopsy (and in selected cases computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance), laparoscopy and angiography, Child-Pugh classification and urea-nitrogen synthesis rate. Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients.\r"

Two patients were excluded with a revised diagnosis of haemorrhagic malignant ascites. Of the remaining 39 patients, 37 bled from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, one from peliosis hepatis and multiple liver cell adenomas, and one from a malignant hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Analysis showed that 59 per cent of patients were in shock on admission and that all but two of the 37 patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were men with cirrhosis. The association with cirrhosis was significantly higher than in a series of 45 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective resection during the same period (P less than 0.05). Treatment consisted of supportive care only in two patients, angiographic embolization in four, emergency liver resection in 11 of whom six died, hepatic artery ligation in 12 of whom eight died, and suture and/or packing in eight of whom six died. One patient died at laparotomy and in another patient bleeding was successfully arrested by intratumoural injection of absolute alcohol. Because of the high operative mortality of emergency surgery in these poor risk patients, prospective evaluation of emergency angiographic embolization is required.\r"

All patients received intravenous fluids commencing the night before surgery. One patient in the control group and none in the treatment groups developed postoperative renal failure. Postoperative deterioration of renal function in patients with normal preoperative function was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment groups (chi 2 = 8.1, d.f. = 2, P less than 0.02). The incidence of renal failure and impairment was lower in this control group than that reported in previous studies. This may be due to the introduction of adequate preoperative hydration. Additional protection occurs by the preoperative administration of either lactulose or sodium deoxycholate.\r"

Seventy-five white, 3-month-old rats were subjected to laparotomy. After the intraperitoneal inoculation of viable scolices, the rats were randomly divided into three groups. Their peritoneal cavities were irrigated with either 1 per cent PVP-I solution (the PVP-I group), hypertonic saline (the HS group) or Ringer's lactate (the control group). Each group was assigned a separate code number; observers blind to the meaning of the code numbers noted all findings during a period of 4 months, after which the rats were killed to allow assessment of the abdominal cavity. The results were decoded after the statistical analyses were completed. The incidence of peritoneal cysts was found to be lower (8.7 per cent) in the PVP-I group compared with the HS (50 per cent) and control (90.9 per cent) groups; the mean number of hydatid cysts per animal was also lower in the PVP-I group compared with the other two groups. We conclude that the scolicidal activity of PVP-I is significantly higher than that of hypertonic saline and that it can be employed as a prophylactic agent against peritoneal hydatidosis.\r"

  ".W": "This paper assesses the utility of strategic alliances as a way of expanding and improving the quality of cancer care provided in communities with limited access to major treatment centres. Alliances provide an organizational model for future community-based cancer programs by accommodating a growing need for interdependence among organizations and providers while permitting substantial independence and autonomy. Five managerial challenges to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of cancer services are identified: to secure mutually reinforcing exchanges between and within all levels of cancer care, to develop protocols and programs relevant to the unique characteristics of patients and providers, to provide treatment and cancer control services, to involve interdisciplinary teams of providers at all levels of care and to achieve quality assurance, improvement and evaluation. In addition, the paper includes a set of guidelines to facilitate the implementation of community cancer programs as strategic alliances: reaffirm the role of community oncologists, primary care physicians and nurses as partners in the program; define the structure and culture necessary for commitment rather than simply compliance; redefine the role of management; establish data-monitoring systems; modify reward systems; and set realistic time frames and expectations.\r"

  ".U": "91235145\r", 
  ".W": "Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery is an operative procedure in which the superficial temporal artery is anastomosed to the middle cerebral artery. The operation, first described in 1969, was employed to circumvent otherwise surgically inaccessible atherosclerotic lesions high in the internal carotid system or in the middle cerebral artery. This assessment compares the findings from 13 surgical series of EC-IC bypass (1464 patients) with those reported in the only prospective, randomized, cooperative trial of this procedure (1377 patients). Analysis of the outcomes in the 1464 patients included in the surgical series produced insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that post-EC-IC bypass stroke rates were lower than the rates of either the medically or surgically treated groups in the controlled clinical trial. In the absence of reliable, objective evidence of the existence of a group of patients in whom surgical intervention is superior to medical treatment in reducing the frequency of stroke, the results of the single controlled clinical trial, which demonstrated no benefit of bypass, must be accepted as the best evidence currently available.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To test three methods of introducing health charts into the medical records of six family medicine units. DESIGN: Quasi-experiment. PARTICIPANTS: The staff physicians and family medicine residents in all six units and the nurses in two units. INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 (minimal intervention): health charts, a user's guide and one training session. Group 2 (intermediate intervention): same intervention as for group 1 plus two feedback sessions at 3 and 6 months. Group 3 (maximum intervention): same intervention as for group 2 plus promotion of the team concept (nurses were included). The intervention phase lasted from September 1987 to August 1988. OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency with which the health charts were used, the item scores of each preventive care activity and the overall unit scores. Data were gathered through chart audits at baseline and at the end of the intervention phase. RESULTS: The frequency with which the health charts were used varied from 3.9% to 26.9%. The greatest increases in item scores were observed in the use of mammography (20.0%), counselling on lifestyle (19.4%) and breast examination (17.2%). Although the overall improvement in the unit scores was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) the hypothesis of an increasing gradient of effect across the three intervention groups could not be tested because of the variation in scores across the units. CONCLUSION: Health charts and other similar tools are useful; however, they are not sufficient to change practice behaviours. The support of a \"champion\" on the health care team might well be a determining factor of success for the delivery of preventive services in primary care practice.\r"

PATIENTS: Ten patients (seven women) with toxic epidermal necrolysis referred to the centre from 1984 to 1990. INTERVENTION: Biobrane (Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, New York) was applied to all raw surfaces after the epidermis had been completely separated. It was not removed until the epidermis had regenerated. MAIN RESULTS: The age of the patients varied from 27 to 90 (mean 45) years. The proportion of body surface area involved was 20% to 95% (mean 58.5%). Nine of the patients had received steroids and antibiotics prophylactically before being referred to the burn centre; the steroids were immediately tapered and the antibiotics withdrawn unless there was a specific infection. Urinary tract infection developed in seven patients, respiratory failure in six and systemic sepsis in six. All of the patients ultimately required antibiotics for treatment of systemic infections. Two patients died; both had severe illness before the onset of the toxic epidermal necrolysis. Biobrane provided a marked reduction in pain, eliminated the need for further dressings and allowed early, aggressive physiotherapy. The wounds healed completely within 14 to 21 days, with no significant scarring or need for skin grafting. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a temporary skin substitute is recommended for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis. There is no indication for prophylactic steroid or antibiotic therapy; indeed, such therapy is probably contraindicated.\r"

Pericardial window was indicated because they continued to drain greater than 100 ml/day of pericardial fluid through the pigtail catheter for greater than or equal to 3 days. A 0.038 inch guidewire was advanced through the pigtail catheter into the pericardial space and then the catheter was removed. A 20 mm diameter, 3 cm long balloon dilating catheter was advanced to straddle the parietal pericardium. Manual inflations were performed until the waist produced by the pericardium disappeared. All patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort and with no complications. A left or bilateral pleural effusion occurred in all patients after PBPW. No patient developed recurrent pericardial tamponade at a mean follow-up of 6 +/- 2 months. Thus, PBPW is a useful and safe technique to avoid surgery in patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade.\r"

Patients were randomized to nonionic or ionic groups and were further evaluated regarding the effect of fluid loading prior to catheterization. The ionic agent more often produced subjective reactions (rash, nausea/vomiting). Following ventriculography, both ionic and non-ionic agents produced an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure and this effect was undetermined by fluid loading. Nonionic agents decreased aortic diastolic pressure following ventriculography and this effect was unaltered by fluid loading. In contrast, the ionic agent produced profound hemodynamic changes (drop in both systolic and diastolic pressures) following coronary arteriography and these effects were blunted by prior fluid loading. The ionic agent produced significantly greater heart rate slowing and prolongation of the QT interval than the nonionic agents, suggesting that the latter are potentially less arrhythmogenic. Comparing the two non-ionic agents, we found that both decreased aortic diastolic pressure and increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure following ventriculography. Iohexol produced greater heart rate slowing than did ioxaglate, though the increase was minor compared to the ionic agent. Neither nonionic agent appeared to significantly affect serum creatinine. In conclusion, the two nonionic agents appeared to offer significant advantages over the ionic agent in ventriculography and coronary arteriography.\r"

However, LOCA are substantially more expensive than HOCA, and universal use of LOCA for cardiac angiography would strain the health care budget. Therefore, the choice to use LOCA in place of HOCA should be based on clinically important differences. Review of available published data suggests that HOCA can be used safely and effectively for cardiac angiography in patients with mild or moderately severe heart disease. When HOCA are used, those that do not bind calcium should be chosen as they cause fewer clinically important adverse reactions than those that do bind calcium. Use of LOCA may offer added safety in high risk patients, although to date, this conclusion has not been proved with clinical experience. Nonionic LOCA may be safer to use than ionic LOCA.\r"

Seven cc of contrast was injected at a pressure of 200 PSI at 3cc/sec by Medrad Mark IV power injector. The pressure of injection through the manifold was recorded with an electronic pressure transducer. The lowest injection pressure at 37 degrees C occurred with Hexabrix. Differences in contrast media viscosity were apparent with catheters less than 6 French diameter. There were minimal differences in injection pressures with regard to the coronary curve tip configurations for any of the contrast agents. At 20 degrees C, Isovue had lower injection pressures than the other contrast agents. Injection through 5 French catheters demonstrated a greater than 1.5 atmosphere difference, especially between Omnipaque and Hexabrix. The difference in contrast media injection pressure was greater than 2 atmospheres between 8 French guiding and 8 French diagnostic catheters and between 5 French and 6 French diagnostic catheters and less than 2 atmospheres between 8 French and 6 French diagnostic catheters. Injection pressure differences greater than 1 atmosphere were not observed for catheters of the same French size at body or room temperature contrast injection. These data indicate that important temperature related viscosity differences between agents are present and confirm that the largest differences in contrast media are most apparent for the smallest diameter catheters. Given equivalent image opacification and hemodynamic and adverse effects, selection of a low viscosity contrast media theoretically provides an advantage during procedures using small diameter catheters or interventional procedures requiring contrast media visualization through reduced channels.\r"

  ".W": "Radiographic contrast media (RCM) may alter platelet behavior at concentrations achieved during cardiac angiography. We used quenched-flow aggregometry coupled to single-particle counting to study the influence of RCM on the kinetics of platelet aggregation (less than 5.0 sec) induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 2.86 microM). At a concentration in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of 5 per cent RCM by volume, platelet aggregation was inhibited by diatrizoate, iopamidol and ioxaglate either directly or following incubation of each contrast agent with PRP for 20 minutes. Diatrizoate inhibited more than did iopamidol or ioxaglate (56 +/- 6, versus 39 +/- 3 and 40 +/- 9 per cent respectively; P less than 0.003, p less than 0.009, n = 20 normal subjects). A small reduction (about 16 per cent) in aggregation velocity occurred within 5 seconds of exposure of PRP to all 3 RCM and the onset time (t) or lag period before aggregation begins was significantly prolonged by diatrizoate (p less than 0.03). The RCM vehicles alone (iodinated moiety removed, osmolality readjusted) had no effect on the ADP-induced aggregation. Platelet counts fell significantly after incubation with diatrizoate (12%; p = 0.04). Our data therefore show that early platelet aggregation was inhibited by 3 commonly-used ionic and nonionic contrast agents. Inhibition was apparently caused by the iodinated contrast molecule, began within seconds of platelet-RCM contact and was independent of vehicle composition. Since diatrizoate inhibited aggregation more than iopamidol or ioxaglate, its use may be of additional value during angiographic procedures in clinical situations involving enhanced platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary angioplasty is increasingly used as an attempt to revascularize patients with severe coronary artery disease. To determine the efficacy of such treatment, a new fixed wire angioplasty catheter was evaluated by a multicenter group in a non-randomized fashion in 50 patients, average 58 +/- 11 years (+/- 1 SD), 58% men. Forty-four percent had a prior revascularization procedure (28% angioplasty, 16% coronary bypass surgery), 38% had a prior Q-wave myocardial infarction, 43% had grade 4 angina, and 60% multiple vessel disease. Angioplasty was attempted in 63 lesions which were located in a mid to distal location in 69%, with a proximal tortuosity score of 1.8 (2 = 45-60 degrees entrance angle), and lesion angulation of 1.4 (1 = 45 degrees lesion bend). In 88%, the device was the primary catheter used and in 6%, it was chosen when another system failed. The balloon was able to successfully cross 94% of all lesions attempted. Six lesions were crossed and dilated but significant residual stenoses remained. There were no significant device malfunctions, or angiographic or clinical complications. This feasibility evaluation of this new fixed wire system yielded excellent angiographic results. Although not a comparative study, this analysis suggests that this new generation of angioplasty catheter may improve the safety and efficacy of complex coronary angioplasty.\r"

It was found that the ENT patients had a very much longer history, had more nasal symptoms, and suffered none of the neurological complications attributable to the disease. All the neurological patients presented with a complication after a comparatively short history and had few nasal symptoms. One ENT patient was found to have a mucopyocoele, whereas 5 were found in the neurological patients, all of whom had bony deficiencies demonstrated by radiology and at surgery. Once diagnosed and treated the ENT patients all made full recoveries while 3 of the neurological patients remain with sequelae of the disease. Our study suggests that dehiscences of the surrounding bone increase the risk of potentially serious intracranial problems from sphenoiditis, whereas the chronicity of symptoms is of secondary importance.\r"

This is true for all types of graft, be they of natural or man-made material. There are, therefore, 2 areas for consideration when looking at the problems encountered in such reconstructions: first, the materials' biocompatability and, secondly, the mechanical effects of the positioning of the graft in the reconstructed ossicular chain. The present work examines these mechanical effects using the finite element method to determine stress and displacement levels in the reconstructed ossicular chain. It is found that the stress levels at the implant-stapedial joint increases as the implant is gradually moved down the malleus. In contrast there is thought to be an increase in sound transmission as the implant is moved down the malleus. Changes in rigidity and hardness of the implant appear to make only modest stress attenuations at the implant-stapes interface.\r"

This may be an important factor in sudden deafness, more likely as a complicating factor of other disorders rather than as a truly primary aetiology. Factors and diseases which alter RCD are discussed and a possible link between the viral and vascular causes of idiopathic sudden deafness is suggested. While several lines of therapy seem promising there is still no clinically proved method for improving RCD. With the development of an acceptable therapeutic regimen, we feel that the possibility of reduced RCD should be considered and that a deformability test be included in the work-up of patients with a sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\r"

It is however unclear whether this is due to tumour implantation in the tracheotomy track, or paratracheal lymph node metastasis. To investigate the pathophysiology of stomal recurrence, the recurrence rate and clinical outcome of 26 cases of T3N0M0 glottic cancer treated with emergency tracheotomy and subsequent laryngectomy were analysed, and compared with 65 stage-matched cases treated with laryngectomy alone. Analysis shows the 'emergency tracheotomy' group to have a very poor prognosis with a higher incidence of recurrence at the stoma, and also in the regional lymph nodes. These findings suggest that paratracheal lymph node metastasis is an important mechanism in the development of stomal recurrence and thus has considerable implications for the prevention of such a recurrence following laryngectomy in the patient presenting with malignant airway obstruction.\r"

Also, patients with a poorly differentiated tumour were twice as likely to need a second neck dissection as those with a well differentiated tumour. The overall 5-year survival after second neck dissection was 35% and the perioperative mortality 1.92%. Significant factors predicting survival after a second neck dissection were the time to recurrence, the clinical neck node status at recurrence, the number of histologically invaded nodes in the neck and the presence of extra-nodal disease.\r"

It resulted in a significant reduction both in the use of nasal packing and in the length of hospital stay compared with a group of controls treated by traditional means. It is proposed that in most cases of acute epistaxis the bleeding point is accessible to cautery and nasal packing should be reserved for a minority of refractory cases. This avoids unnecessary patient discomfort and the complications of prolonged nasal packing and hospitalization.\r"

The method provides an accurate and objective measurement of the geometry of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx in a non-invasive way. In a series of 20 children, age range 4-16 years, it has been possible to demonstrate the changes in the volume of the nasopharynx after adenoidectomy. The relation between the volume of the adenoid and the calculated change of volume in the nasopharynx is found to be proportional and highly significant (P = 0.0005). It is concluded that acoustic rhinometry, which is very easy to perform, gives a reliable, objective measurement of the amount of adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx.

In 11 of 13 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, long-standing chronic otitis media preceded the malignant process and only in 2 patients did the tumour develop without previous chronic infection. Most of the patients presented at an advanced stage of the disease: in 6 the tumour had destroyed surrounding bone, commonly involving the endocranium; in 7 the facial nerve was paralysed and in 8 patients there was total hearing loss. The diagnosis of malignant tumour was established before surgery in 5 patients, but 8 patients were operated upon for suspected chronic otitis. Three patients died without treatment and 10 were treated: 3 with radiotherapy because the tumour was inoperable, 3 had surgery only and 4 patients had surgery and received radiotherapy post-operatively. Of 7 operated patients only 2 are alive without signs of tumour. Our findings suggest that otologists should bear in mind this disease in patients with chronic suppurative otitis and accompanying suspected symptoms. In 2 patients with rare types of sarcoma of the middle ear the diagnosis of tumour was established at an advanced stage and they could not be treated.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a retrospective chart analysis on 449 AIDS patients admitted to Bellevue Hospital Center from 1983-1986 to characterize the etiologies and clinical course of acute renal failure (ARF) and to define the incidence and clinical course of AIDS-associated nephropathy (AAN) in an unselected hospitalized AIDS population. Defining ARF as a rise from baseline serum creatinine of at least 2.0 mg%, we found 88 cases (a prevalence of almost 20%) or 14.5 cases per 100 admissions. Volume depletion was the most common etiology and was as severe a cause of ARF as other etiologies. There were 21 cases of ARF in 17 patients with a peak serum creatinine greater than or equal to 6.0 mg%. Volume depletion accounted for 7/21 of these cases. Baseline renal insufficiency existed in 9/17 patients (12/21 cases) and volume depletion was the cause of ARF in 3 of these cases. Only 4 cases required dialysis. There were 34 patients (prevalence of 7.6% or 3.0 cases per 100 patient-years) with otherwise unexplained chronic renal insufficiency and/or persistent qualitative or quantitative proteinuria and thus were defined on clinical grounds to have AIDS-associated nephropathy. Thirty-two of these patients (94%) had evidence of AAN at or within 1 year of presentation. Eleven patients (32%) reached ESRD (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 6.0 mg%); 9 patients did so within 1 year of presentation and 3 required dialysis. In those with adequate follow-up (9 cases), the mean survival from time of ESRD was 25.5 days and all cases died within 6 months of reaching ESRD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The performance of percutaneous renal biopsy under ultrasound guidance in markedly obese patients is associated with technical difficulties because of the production of poor image quality. Fluoroscopy can be potentially used as an alternative guidance method when the kidneys are not visualized sonographically. However, the presence of uremia in an obese patient imposes an additional risk when fluoroscopy is used because of possible nephrotoxicity from the use of radiocontrast dye. Computerized tomography (CT) provides advantages over these two methods because of the production of excellent spatial resolution of images leading to accurate localization of the kidneys. We performed 59 consecutive percutaneous renal biopsies in 58 patients using CT as guidance. The body mass index (BMI) defined as weight in kilograms/(height in meter)2 [Watson et al. 1979], was used to assess the severity of obesity. Twenty-nine patients had Grade 0 (BMI less than or equal to 24.9), 17 had Grade I (BMI 25-29.9), 7 had Grade II (BMI 30-39.9) and 5 had Grade III (BMI greater than or equal to 40) obesity. Thirty-two patients had superimposed uremia of varying degrees. Image quality was maintained in all four groups, and tissues adequate for diagnosis were obtained in 98% of the attempts. Complications were minimal with no deaths, nephrectomies or surgical interventions attributable directly to the biopsy procedure itself. We recommend the use of CT guidance in the grossly obese patients (Grade II or III) when their kidneys are poorly visualized by sonography.\r"

Significant increases of IgG and IgM RFs and marginal increase of IgA RF were observed during the nephrotic stages. Some patients still showed high titers of IgM RF in the early remission phases. The levels of RFs were normalized during complete remission. It was suggested that polyclonal B cell activation might be involved in the development of this disorder along with T cell abnormalities.\r"

Five patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 125.2 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA) (Group A) and 4 patients with moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 65.5 +/- 8.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA) (Group B) received pulse doses of IgG (0.4 g/kg BW) for 3 consecutive days; these 3-day boli were repeated 3 times at 21-day intervals; since then for a 10-month period one bolus once every 3 weeks has been administered. Five responder patients at the end of the trial received a new renal biopsy. In 4 Group A patients complete remission of proteinuria (daily proteinuria less than 0.2 g) was observed, whereas 1 patient showed partial remission (proteinuria 2 g/day). In Group B patients, 1 showed complete remission and 2 partial remission; in 1 patient no variation of proteinuria was noted. In responder patients clinical and biological findings of the nephrotic syndrome disappeared and a statistically significant increase of creatinine clearance was observed. In control biopsies at the end of the trial the immunofluorescence staining failed to find immunodeposits and recovery of glomerular lesions at light microscopy. In conclusion, IgG therapy seems to be of benefit to patients with IMGN but a randomized clinical trial to confirm this preliminary report is needed.\r"

To determine whether a wrist cuff is necessary to measure the forearm blood flow correctly, we studied the effects of wrist cuff inflation to supra-venous and supra-systolic pressure values over a large range of forearm blood flow values: in the basal state, during post-occlusive hyperaemia of the hand, and during heating of the hand with warm air. Eleven healthy men participated, and the study was carried out at two different ambient temperatures of 20 and 25 degrees C. 2. In the basal state, the measured forearm blood flow was lowest with the wrist cuff at supra-systolic pressure. With the wrist cuff at supra-venous pressure the forearm blood flow was also lower than with an uninflated cuff, but only significantly so when the basal forearm blood flow was higher (at a room temperature of 25 degrees C). 3. During post-occlusive hyperaemia, inflating the wrist cuff to supra-systolic pressure produced the lowest forearm blood flow value at both room temperatures. In addition, with the wrist cuff at supra-venous pressure, forearm blood flow values were lower than with the uninflated cuff, but the supra-venous cuff pressure was clearly less efficient in excluding the hand blood flow than the supra-systolic cuff pressure. 4. During heating of the hand, both supra-systolic and supra-venous cuff pressures were effective in excluding the hand blood flow at both room temperatures. The forearm blood flow measured with the wrist cuff at supra-systolic pressure was lower than that measured with the wrist cuff at supra-venous pressure, but the difference was only significant at a room temperature of 20 degrees C. 5. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a wrist cuff at supra-systolic pressure is most appropriate for the exclusion of the hand circulation in order to measure the forearm blood flow correctly.\r"

To determine whether any peptide differences between obese and lean rats might be due to the overweight condition per se, separate groups of obese rats were food-restricted to reduce their body weight to lean values. 2. Concentrations of neuromedin B, a bombesin-like peptide, in the central hypothalamus were significantly higher in obese than in lean rats. This difference was not affected in food-restricted obese rats. 3. Hypothalamic levels of neuropeptide Y, an extremely potent central appetite stimulant, were similar in lean and freely fed obese rats but central hypothalamic levels of neuropeptide Y rose significantly in food-restricted obese rats. 4. These findings suggest that disturbances in hypothalamic neuromedin B concentrations may be involved in the obesity syndrome of the fa/fa Zucker rat. Increased central hypothalamic levels of neuropeptide Y in food-restricted rats suggest that this peptide may help to defend body weight by stimulating eating after weight loss.\r"

Most, but not all, experimental studies suggest that a reduced plasma protein concentration perfusing the kidney may reduce tubular sodium reabsorption. Hypoproteinaemic disease states are usually associated with sodium retention, which is not always volume-dependent. 2. We induced a 21% and 24% reduction in plasma total protein and plasma albumin, respectively, in unanaesthetized sheep by acute extracorporeal plasmapheresis. Arterial pressure did not change, and changes in circulatory volume were minimised by infusion of crystalloid to maintain pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, measured using a Swann-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter. 3. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant change in creatinine clearance, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity or urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant reduction in plasma osmolality, increase in urine osmolality and fall in free water clearance. 5. The results suggest that in the absence of detectable changes in circulating volume or arterial pressure, acute hypoproteinaemia is associated with significant changes in renal water handling, but has no direct effect on sodium excretion or on renal release of renin and kallikrein.\r"

In primary biliary cirrhosis, the major M2 autoantigen, reacting with antimitochondrial antibodies in sera from greater than 90% of patients, has been identified as the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, two recent reports suggest that alternative polypeptides may be major autoantigens. 2. The evidence that a 75 kDa subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain is a major autoantigen (Frostell, Mendel-Hartvig, Nelson, Totterman, Bjorkland & Ragan, Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28, 157-65) is refuted. The findings of Frostell et al. can be explained by contamination of complex I with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, evidence for which is presented here. 3. Inspection of the partial amino acid sequence of an unidentified mitochondrial autoantigen (Muno, Kominami, Ishii, Usui, Saituku, Sakakibara & Namihisa, Hepatology 1990; 11, 16-23) shows that it is the E1 beta-subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, previously identified as a major autoantigen, and not a 'new' alternative major autoantigen. 4. These findings substantiate previous work showing that the mitochondrial M2 autoantigens identified so far in primary biliary cirrhosis are all polypeptide components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or the other related 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.\r"

This study in vivo examines the effects of chronic metabolic acidosis on the relationship between growth, nitrogen disposal and skeletal muscle catabolism in the rat. 4. Growth, nitrogen utilization and acquisition of body mass were significantly impaired in acidotic animals compared with pair-fed controls. 5. Total nitrogen excretion was significantly increased in acidotic rats despite decreased urea production. The time course of this response to acidosis was synchronous with that of accelerated protein catabolism in skeletal muscle. 6. It is proposed that metabolic acidosis impairs growth by stimulating skeletal muscle protein catabolism. It is suggested that this forms part of a co-ordinated multi-organ homoeostatic response to acidosis, skeletal muscle and down-regulated urea production supplying the nitrogen required for renal ammoniagenesis.\r"

Pressure/flow relationships were determined in the in situ blood-perfused superior mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds of spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats before and after destruction of the endothelium with detergent. The effects of indomethacin on the regression of pressure on flow were also investigated in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, as were the endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to carbachol in the mesenteric bed. 2. In the spontaneously hypertensive rats the regression line of pressure on flow in the two vascular beds was both steeper and more elevated than in the Wistar-Kyoto rats, showing that there was greater resistance to flow in the hypertensive animals. Destruction of the endothelium significantly increased the slope of the regression in both Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats: the increases in the Wistar-Kyoto rats were 2.4 +/- 0.3 fold (mesenteric) and 2.0 +/- 0.5 fold (hindquarters) which were comparable with the respective increases of 1.6 +/- 0.3 fold and 1.8 +/- 0.3 fold in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. 3. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intravenously) had no effect on the pressure/flow relations in either of the vascular beds of the spontaneously hypertensive rats. 4. The dose-response curves for the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in response to carbachol were not significantly different in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. 5.

In seven subjects, adipose tissue blood flow was measured and the measurements were continued for 6 h after eating a mixed meal. The pattern of amino acid metabolism across the adipose tissue was remarkably little disturbed after the meal, except for a short period of apparent uptake of alanine as the concentration of that amino acid rose. 4. The pattern of amino acid metabolism across adipose tissue was qualitatively similar to that across the forearm, although it differed quantitatively in that glutamate uptake was more prominent (compared with glutamine release) in the adipose tissue. 5.

To assess this role in head-out water immersion, we compared, in clearance studies, the effects of acute (24 h) and chronic (7 days) administration of indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, on the renal response to head-out water immersion in six healthy subjects on a 200 mmol of sodium/day diet and on a 40 mmol of sodium/day diet. 2. Indomethacin caused a similar degree of sodium retention on each of these two diets. 3. During the 40 mmol of sodium/day diet, acute administration of indomethacin decreased sodium excretion before, as well as during, head-out water immersion; however, the relative increase caused by head-out water immersion was normal. After chronic administration of indomethacin, both baseline sodium excretion and the natriuresis induced by head-out water immersion were similar to those in control studies. 4. During the 200 mmol of sodium/day diet, indomethacin had no effect on baseline sodium excretion, nor on the natriuretic effect of head-out water immersion. 5. Head-out water immersion decreased tubular lithium reabsorption and increased diluting segment delivery. Despite opposite effects of indomethacin on these parameters, indomethacin did not prevent the tubular effects of head-out water immersion on either diet. However, indomethacin did prevent the marked increase in estimated renal plasma flow and the fall in filtration fraction that were observed during head-out water immersion in the absence of indomethacin (control). 6. Head-out water immersion was not associated with an increase in urinary excretion of prostaglandins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the adequacy of modern dialysis techniques in maintaining the sulphate balance, intra- and interdialysis plasma profiles and removal rates of sulphate were studied in 20 stable patients on maintenance haemodialysis. The influence of sulphate levels on the distribution of calcium-complex species was also investigated. 2. Sulphate was determined by ion-exchange chromatography of both serum ultrafiltrates, taken at the start of, during, at the end of, and at 24 h and 48 h after a dialysis session, and whole diffusate collections. Dialyser clearances of sulphate were assessed by two independent procedures and compared with those of urea and creatinine, on two different methods of dialysis, i.e. traditional haemodialysis with Cuprophan hollow fibre filters, and haemodiafiltration with high-flux Polysulphone or polyacrylonitrile dialysers. Concentrations of the main serum ions were determined before and after dialysis and used to solve a multiple mass balance equation system by which concentrations of the calcium-complex species were calculated. 3. Before dialysis, sulphate levels were eight times those determined in 17 control subjects and remained higher than normal at the end of dialysis. These changes were independent of the dialysis procedure. There was a close correlation between serum levels of sulphate and creatinine. Dialyser clearances of sulphate were comparable with those of creatinine, but lower than those of urea. Clearances of all solutes were higher on haemodiafiltration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Leukotriene E4 was unequivocally identified by g.c.-m.s. in the urine of healthy subjects and patients with multiple trauma after its conversion to 5-hydroxyeicosanoic acid. Leukotriene E4 was routinely isolated from 24 h urine samples by solid-phase extraction followed by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. and was subsequently quantified by r.i.a. 3. Healthy subjects excreted daily 10 +/- 3 nmol of leukotriene E4/mol of creatinine (mean +/- SEM, n = 16) into urine. 4. Patients with multiple trauma who did not develop adult respiratory distress syndrome (n = 7) excreted 76.8 +/- 6.7 nmol of leukotriene E4/mol of creatinine (mean +/- SEM) daily during the first 10 days after trauma, which was significantly (P less than 0.01) more than did healthy subjects. 5. Excretion of leukotriene E4 was even more enhanced in three patients with multiple trauma who developed adult respiratory distress syndrome. Maximal amounts of 593 +/- 185 nmol of leukotriene E4/mol of creatinine (mean +/- SEM) were excreted on day 9 after trauma by these three patients, which corresponds to a 7.7- and a 59-fold increase in excretion of leukotriene E4 compared with patients with multiple trauma who did not develop adult respiratory distress syndrome and healthy subjects, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma aluminum concentrations and, in normal men, urinary excretion of aluminum were monitored before and after the oral aluminum load. 4. Intragastric pH increased significantly with ranitidine but not with placebo (P less than 0.001). Urinary aluminum excretion increased significantly after the administration of aluminum hydroxide during the placebo phase (P less than 0.001) but not during the ranitidine phase. Plasma aluminium concentrations were higher in the patients with renal failure than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.05), but were unchanged in both groups after the oral aluminium load. 5.

Intracellular pH and Na+/H+ antiport activity were determined by a fluorimetric method in cultured skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. 2. The intracellular pH was significantly more alkaline at three different extracellular pH values in both myoblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells from the spontaneously hypertensive rats than in those from the normotensive control rats. 3. A kinetic analysis of the Na+/H+ antiport activity in these cells showed that the raised activity in the spontaneously hypertensive rats was due to an increased maximal transport capacity in vascular smooth muscle cells and to an increase in the affinity of the antiport for internal H+ in the myoblasts. 4. When the extracellular pH was reduced in the skeletal muscle cells of both types of rat, the intracellular pH fell. However, in vascular smooth muscle cells, a reduction in the extracellular pH was not associated with a fall in the intracellular pH. This resistance of the intracellular pH to changes in the extracellular pH differentiates vascular smooth muscle cells from other cells that have been studied in this way.\r"

Clin. Chem. 1988; 34, 2268-70). 2. N-Terminal sequencing of the Mr-38,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, after SDS/PAGE and electrotransfer on polyvinyl difluoride membranes, showed that it differed from plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by the loss of 17 N-terminal amino acids. 3. Carbohydrate analysis of the isolated Mr-38,000 form revealed a total lack of neutral sugars. 4. In contrast, the Mr-51,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is glycosylated and thus could be differentiated by virtue of its reactivity with concanavalin A. The analysis of 25 faecal extracts from patients with Crohn's disease allowed us to confirm that the presence of the glycosylated form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was closely related to the degree of inflammation. 5. From these data, it may be hypothesized that the hydrolytic activity of some glycosidases is greatly reduced in active Crohn's disease.\r"

The pathophysiology of collagenous colitis remains obscure. The thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer may be a response to chronic inflammation or a local abnormality of collagen synthesis. The precise mechanism of the diarrhea in collagenous colitis is also unclear, and it has not been possible to link the diarrhea directly to the excess collagen deposition. The relationship between collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, another type of microscopic colitis, remains to be defined; elucidating the relationship between the two disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both.\r"

Immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine-methionine, met5-enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin were extracted from specimens of muscularis externa (patient ages: 19-84 years) and measured by radioimmunoassay. Intracellular electrical activity was recorded from strips of circular muscle (patients ages: 49-84 years) using glass microelectrodes; inhibitory junction potentials were evoked by electrical field stimulation. There were no significant differences (t tests: P greater than 0.05) between neuropeptide concentrations in patients less than 70 years old (N = 28) compared to patients greater than or equal to 70 years old (N = 12). However, the amplitude of inhibitory junction potentials declined with increasing patient age (r = -0.58, P = 0.02, N = 16), with no change in resting membrane potentials (r = 0.22; P greater than 0.05). The decline in amplitude in women (r = -0.68, P = 0.03, N = 9) preceded the decline in men (r = -0.62, P = 0.10, N = 7). Age-related decline in inhibitory junction potentials could be related to decreased: density of inhibitory nerves, release of inhibitory neurotransmitter, density of binding sites for inhibitory neurotransmitter on smooth muscle, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, this decline might represent a change in interaction of inhibitory neurotransmitter with the smooth muscle membrane, such as a change in coupling of binding site with the potassium channel, decreased number of potassium channels, or altered permeability of the potassium channel.\r"

Isolated segments from the mid-colon of the cat generated regular, continuous slow waves at 6.5 +/- 1.1 cpm. Activation of the intrinsic nerves by electrical field stimulation transiently reduced the rate of slow-wave generation to 4.7 +/- 0.7 cpm (P less than 0.001). The response to electrical stimulation was blocked by tetrodotoxin and alpha-chymotrypsin. The following antagonists were not effective in blocking the response: atropine, hexamethonium, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, methysergide, naloxone, or imidazole. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (5 x 10(-7) M) decreased slow wave frequency to 4.5 +/- 0.4 cpm. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) fragment 10-28 inhibited the effect of electrical field stimulation but also decreased the slow-wave frequency. VIP-immunoreactive nerves were much more abundant in the plexus submucosus extremus than in the circular muscle of the muscularis externa. Thus, pacemakers for colonic slow waves may be modulated by intrinsic colonic nerves, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide may be the neurotransmitter responsible for this modulation.\r"

The microcirculatory changes in the rat colonic mucosa within 1 hr of topical exposure to 10% acetic acid were assessed. Colonic mucosal blood flow signals measured by laser Doppler flowmetry were significantly reduced to 61 +/- 8, 52 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of baseline values at 1 min, 4 min, and 10 min after the colonic mucosa was exposed to 10% acetic acid, respectively, but not in controls exposed to saline. After the start of application of 10% acetic acid (for 4 min), in vivo microscopy studies demonstrated that colonic mucosal ischemia (stasis of the red blood cells in the mucosal capillaries) occurred at 9 +/- 5 min (mean +/- SEM). Evidence of endothelial cell death (failure to exclude a fluorescent dye, propidium iodide, by endothelial cells) developed at 25 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SEM). These findings indicate that within minutes after contact of the colonic mucosa with 10% acetic acid, colonic mucosal ischemia develops, followed shortly by death of endothelial cells. The data do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the reductions in mucosal blood flow and loss of endothelial cell viability in response to acetic acid. Nevertheless, because these events occur at such an early time point, they may play a pathogenetic role in the development of the subsequent inflammatory and ulcerative changes in this animal model of colitis. Further studies to define the potential causal relationships between these parameters are warranted.\r"

Stool habits, total gastrointestinal transit time, and anorectal motility were evaluated in all children before and at the end of the treatment period. Cisapride significantly increased stool frequency from 1.2 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 1.9 stools/week (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05), whereas the lesser effect of placebo was not significant (1.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.8 +/- 0.8 stools/week; P = 0.4). Both treatments significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased laxative or suppository use. Total gastrointestinal transit time was decreased by cisapride (90.8 +/- 9.2 hr to 57.2 +/- 20.2 hr; P less than 0.05) but was not affected by placebo. Anorectal manometry showed that cisapride, but not placebo, significantly decreased the rectoanal inhibitory reflex threshold and the conscious rectal sensitivity threshold. It is concluded that cisapride improves gastrointestinal motility and bowel habits in children with chronic idiopathic constipation and may be useful in the management of some children with this disorder.\r"

Using the thymocyte proliferation assay, sera from the same patients contained significantly increased inhibitory activity against interleukin-1 alpha (P = 0.025) and interleukin-1 beta-induced cell activation (P = 0.00005) as compared with controls. Changes in both interleukin-1 alpha (P = 0.020) and interleukin-1 beta (P = 0.012) inhibitor concentrations correlated significantly with changes in clinical disease activity. None of the patient sera contained IgG or IgM autoantibodies to IL-1 alpha, nor did they exert significant inhibitory activity against interleukin 1 beta in the fibroblast prostaglandin E2-induction assay. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the presence of one or several regulators of interleukin-1-induced T-cell activation in sera from patients with active Crohn's disease.\r"

However, celiac disease is primarily a small intestinal mucosal disorder, and so we have examined the possibility that secreted, mucosal IgA anti-gliadin antibody might provide a more relevant measure of gluten sensitivity than that obtained from serum tests. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody and serum, salivary, and small intestinal aspirate IgA anti-gliadin antibody were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum IgA and IgG anti-gliadin antibody were markedly increased in untreated celiacs (N = 31) as compared to normals (N = 20) or disease controls (N = 39) (P less than 0.0001). Levels were lower in treated (N = 30) than untreated celiacs (P less than 0.001). In intestinal aspirates both untreated and treated patients had similar levels of IgA anti-gliadin antibody (P = 0.48), but both were significantly higher than in controls (P less than 0.01). Salivary IgA anti-gliadin antibody, by contrast, was not increased in celiac patients as compared to controls. Serum IgA anti-gliadin antibody was the most sensitive (84%) and specific (95%) test for detecting untreated celiac disease. It was also the most useful in patient follow-up where it provides an early objective indicator of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Mucosal IgA responses to gliadin in celiac disease appear to be compartmentalized, with different portions of the gastrointestinal tract functioning as separate immunological organs. Our results also demonstrate that serum and secretory IgA production are under independent control.\r"

Two of the nine untreated celiacs negative for IgA EmA showed positivity for IgA AGA. While IgA AGA and R1-ARA disappeared in all the celiacs tested one year after gluten-free diet, IgA EmA persisted at low titer in seven (18%) of these 38 subjects, although the jejunal biopsy showed a complete regrowth of jejunal villi. All the disease control patients as well as the blood donors tested were always negative for the three IgA antibodies. Our results state that the search for both IgA EmA and AGA gives the best results in the screening of celiac disease, since the positivity for at least one of these two antibodies allows identification with a 100% specificity of the 90% of untreated celiac patients.\r"

Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases. No significant complications of endoscopy were observed. Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%). Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases. Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs. We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the comparative efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg, a proton pump inhibitor, versus ranitidine 150 mg twice a day, an H2-receptor antagonist, in healing duodenal ulcers we performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 309 patients with endoscopically diagnosed ulcers. Patients were treated for up to four weeks and were seen at week 2 and at week 4, if unhealed at week 2, for determination of ulcer status by endoscopy, review of daily self-assessment symptom diaries, and clinical laboratory including fasting serum gastrin. Gastrin levels were repeated two weeks after cessation of study medication. Evaluation of baseline demographic and laboratory parameters demonstrated no significant differences between the two groups at entry. At week 2, 42% of the omeprazole and 34% of the ranitidine-treated patients were healed (P = NS). At week 4, there was a 19% advantage in ulcer healing for the omeprazole-treated patients in comparison to those treated with ranitidine (82% vs 63%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Healing of ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm occurred in 83% of those treated with omeprazole versus 37% treated with ranitidine (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in rate of pain relief or incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities. Mean fasting serum gastrin value during treatment increased over the baseline in both groups, (P less than 0.05). The percent change was significantly greater with omeprazole but few patients had elevations above the upper limit of normal for the assay. Both drugs were well tolerated. Omeprazole 20 mg demonstrated superiority in healing duodenal ulcers at four weeks in comparison to ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and was more effective in healing ulcers greater than or equal to 1.0 cm.\r"

The increase in serum hHGF activity seen in two patients with \"acute-on-chronic\" hepatitis was similar to that found in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The serum level of hHGF from patients with acute hepatitis is related to the stage of their illness. The average value for 31 patients was about three times that of normal human serum. In some patients, the time course for the increase in serum hHGF activity was similar to that demonstrated for alpha-fetoprotein. The mean hHGF activity in serum for the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 25 patients with liver cirrhosis was increased also compared with that of normal human serum. In addition, serum hHGF activity in three of seven patients studied after partial hepatectomy for a space-occupying lesion of the liver was increased. These data suggest that the increase in serum hHGF activity present in patients with various liver diseases reflects a self-defense mechanism that is involved in the process of liver cell regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "When insulin and glucagon are administered to rats with severe liver injury, survival is enhanced with an attenuation of the liver injury compared to that of untreated controls. In rats with acute liver injury both hormones produce a rapid normalization of hepatic protein content following initiation of DNA synthesis. When rats receive both hormones after partial hepatectomy, the first burst of DNA synthesis reaches a maximum earlier than that seen in controls. Both hormones enhance the increment of hepatic putrescine essential for DNA synthesis through activation of ornithine decaroxylase and/or spermidine-N1-acetyltransferase. The enhancement of putrescine content by each hormone is additive. Putrescine supplementation promotes hepatic DNA synthesis after hepatectomy. Based on these data, we conclude that a combination of insulin and glucagon is effective in the therapy of acute hepatic failure in rats. The restoration of liver function as well as the stimulation of liver cell proliferation via putrescine production may contribute to this effect.\r"

In vitro experiments have shown that fulminant hepatic failure serum is cytotoxic to rabbit hepatocytes and inhibits DNA synthesis on short-term incubation with isolated regenerating rat hepatocytes. When fulminant hepatic failure serum is injected into partially hepatectomized rats at the time of maximal DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA is reduced significantly. The effect is greater with sera obtained from patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis or an adverse drug reaction and is associated with a less than 10,000-dalton fraction. No stimulation of DNA synthesis is observed with injection of the greater than 10,000-dalton serum fraction into normal rats. In preliminary experiments, no increase in epidermal growth factor production has been found in liver failure. Overall, the substances present in fulminant hepatic failure serum appear to be inhibitory rather than stimulatory for liver cell regeneration.\r"

The saline solution is injected into the submucosa at the site of the lesion with the help of needle forceps. A snare is placed around the elevated tissue, which is then resected endoscopically by electrocoagulation. The specimen obtained includes both submucosal and mucosal tissues. The authors used this technique to resect a total of 71 lesions of the colon. They were classified histologically as 21 adenocarcinomas, 46 adenomas, 3 metaplastic polyps, and 1 juvenile polyp. All lesions were confirmed to be entirely intramucosal by histological examination. The strip biopsy technique permits resection of tissue down to the submucosal layer regardless of the morphological type of the lesion. This suggests that strip biopsy is an effective new form of endoscopic treatment for early colon cancer.\r"

In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia.\r"

Markedly atypical cells were identified in 36% of patients with a false negative cytology result. These findings were not seen in patients with benign disease.

However, the degree of fragmentation required rendered removal through a smaller tract inefficient, a mean 53% of stone mass being retrievable through a 16 F tract (N = 11). Repeated laser activation at 1 mm from the gallbladder mucosa produced minimal injury, regardless of pulse energy. When the laser fiber was pressed against the mucosa, perforation of the gallbladder was possible at therapeutic pulse energy, but this did not lead to clinical sequelae. We conclude that the pulsed dye laser is a safe and effective means of fragmenting gallbladder calculi in vivo.\r"

Properly applied abdominal pressure can limit patient discomfort and shorten examination time. Various techniques for abdominal pressure were studied in 201 consecutive patients who had total colonoscopy to the cecum. Abdominal pressure or change of body position was used 619 times in 165 patients (82%), with an average of 3.75 pressure applications per colonoscopy, most lasting less than 30 sec. Pressure was most commonly used when the endoscope tip was at the splenic flexure. Non-specific pressure to a region of the abdomen where looping developed, endoscopically observed specific pressure near the tip, and position change were used in a stepwise manner. Non-specific pressure was more successful in the left (78%) than in the right (47%) colon (p less than 0.0005). As intubation progressed left to right, specific pressure became more useful. When abdominal pressure was not useful, a change in patient position from left lateral to supine was successful in advancing the endoscope tip in 68% of patients.\r"

Three different models of colonoscopies were utilized; all were manufactured by the Olympus Corporation of America, and included a videoendoscope, a CF-20L immersible OES-type instrument, and an older fiberoptic colonoscope, CFLB-3W. In all colonoscopies, the cecum was reached in 95.9%, even when an obstructing lesion or stenosis was present. Total intubation was performed in 97% of cases with the videoendoscope, 95.5% with the CF-20L, and 95.7% with the CFLB-3W. In a subgroup of 865 colonoscopies, total colonoscopy was performed in 98% of cases when obstructing lesions (carcinoma or stricture) were excluded from analysis. In this subgroup, total colonoscopy could not be performed in 16 patients because of colonic fixation, tortuosity, or for unknown anatomical reasons. Forty-five percent of this subgroup was female, but of the 16 patients in whom total colonoscopy was not possible, 15 were women, 5 of whom had a previous hysterectomy. We conclude that in the absence of any obstructing lesion, an expert can perform complete colonoscopy in 98% of examinations, and in 95% of all patients presenting for colonoscopy. Total colonoscopy may be more difficult in women than men, but a previous hysterectomy does not seem to adversely affect the ability to perform colonoscopy. The type of instrument used for colonoscopy does not impact on the ability to visualize the entire colon.\r"

Initial results in 19 patients with symptomatic grade I, II, or III hemorrhoids suggest that the technique is very effective in relieving bleeding, and frequently alleviates prolapse as well. The technique has proven to be well tolerated and associated with high patient satisfaction and low complication rates, with no serious complications noted. This modality is eminently suited for single session examination and therapy of the patient undergoing endoscopic evaluation for lower gastrointestinal bleeding whose findings are limited to hemorrhoidal disease.\r"

For four sessions, 1 ml of methylene blue was added to 9 ml of sclerosant. The endoscopist judged each injection to be intravariceal or paravariceal. This was confirmed by fluoroscopy. There were 57 injections (28 with methylene blue, 29 without) in the eight sclerotherapy sessions. Intravariceal injections were confirmed fluoroscopically in 64.9% of injections (60.7% with methylene blue 69% without).

The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated the role of fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the management of 81 patients with corrosive ingestion. A total of 381 endoscopic examinations were performed: 88 within 96 hours following corrosive ingestion, 108 between the third and ninth week, and 185 during the period of follow-up after bougie dilation of esophageal strictures. The customary endoscopic classification of burns (grades 0 to 3) was modified by subdividing grade 2 burns into 2a and 2b, and grade 3 burns into 3a and 3b for prognostic and therapeutic implications. There was no significant correlation between oropharyngeal and upper gastrointestinal tract injury. Early major complications and deaths were confined to patients with grade 3 burns. All patients with grade 0, 1, and 2a burns recovered without sequelae. The majority of patients (71.4%) with grade 2b injury and all survivors with grade 3 injury developed esophageal or gastric cicatrization, or both, which needed endoscopic or surgical treatment. There were no complications related to endoscopy. We conclude that early endoscopy is not only a safe, reliable, and accurate diagnostic tool in such patients, but also is of crucial importance in management and prognosis.\r"

In an in vitro study we have shown that contact laser probes produce consistent and reproducible thermal lesions in the human stomach wall. Contact laser energies of 40 to 60 joules are optimal for the ablation of early gastric cancer. Energies greater than 90 joules are associated with a high incidence of gastric perforation. Contact laser probes may have advantages over non-contact laser techniques for the endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer in patients who are unfit for major surgery.\r"

Twenty patients scheduled for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were sedated using a computer-controlled system and endoscopy was performed by the same operator. Oxygen saturation reduced significantly (p less than 0.001) during the procedure, and remained significantly lower than baseline values at the end of the procedure. Patient assessment of sedation and anxiety using linear analogue scales showed a significant increase in sedation (p less than 0.00001) and decrease in anxiety (p less than 0.003) compared with baseline values. There were variable positive (p less than 0.001) and negative (p less than 0.002) changes in blood pressure from baseline values. Overall conditions for endoscopy were good. Computer-controlled delivery of propofol provides satisfactory sedation and conditions for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and merits further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is an important risk factor in hemodialysis patients. Fluid overload and increased peripheral resistance are considered the two main causes. We studied the relation between volume state and blood pressure in 18 hemodialysis patients. Actual total body water (aTBW) was measured as tritium space and \"ideal\" total body water (iTBW) by an anthropometric method. The difference between aTBW and iTBW was considered a measure of fluid excess or deficit. Twelve patients were overhydrated, 5%-23%. Their predialysis blood pressure was significantly correlated to their degree of fluid excess; systolic BP:r = 0.71, p = 0.03, diastolic BP:r = 0.73, p = 0.02, mean arterial BP:r = 0.76, p = 0.03. Five of these patients had multiple antihypertensive drugs instead of adequate ultrafiltration. Five patients had a fluid deficit of -3 to -13% and hypertension due to vasoconstriction. Four of these were adequately treated with antihypertensive drugs but had exaggerated ultrafiltration. TBW determination with tritium is simple to perform and gives information on the volume state and thereby on the cause of hypertension in hemodialysis patients. Based on this, appropriate treatment can be chosen.\r"

  ".W": "Paired filtration dialysis (PFD) is a new dialysis strategy whereby a hemofilter and a hemodialyzer are coupled in series. It has been assumed that this approach allows a better solute elimination than conventional hemodialysis (HD), allowing a shortening of dialysis time. To evaluate this hypothesis, solute elimination with PFD either with 0.4 m2 polysulphone (PS) and 1.36 m2 cuprophan (CU) 3x3 h/wk, or with 0.4 m2 PS and 1.06 m2 CU 3x4 h/wk, was compared to HD with 1.36 m2 CU, 3x4 hours weekly in the same patients. During PFD, 10L were ultrafiltered and substituted by saline. Overall extraction of UV absorbing solutes (MW less than 10,000 Dalton), and extraction of individual solutes identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were compared as well as urea kinetics. For PFD 3x3 h overall extraction of UV-absorbing compounds and of hippuric acid was significantly higher than for HD 3x4 h (p less than 0.05). Overall extraction of UV-absorbing compounds and of all but one individual compound under study was markedly higher for PFD 3x4 h vs conventional HD 3x4 h (p less than 0.01), in spite of a higher diffusive area with the latter technique. No differences in urea kinetics were observed for the 3 strategies. It is concluded that solute extraction during PFD is higher than during HD, if the treatment time is the same. Even if treatment is shortened to 3x3 h weekly, solute extraction with PFD is at least as efficient as with HD.\r"

  ".W": "To make stroma-free hemoglobin (SFHb) capable of carrying oxygen satisfactorily in vivo it is necessary both to improve its intravascular persistence and to reduce its affinity for oxygen. The method used up to now has consisted of chemical modification of SFHb to lower its oxygen affinity (fixation of permanent effector inside the phosphate binding site or intramolecular cross-linking of the deoxy form of SFHb), then polymerization or substitution with polymers. We have designed new functionalized polymers (from dextran and polyoxyethylene), capable of mimicking the effect of the natural intraerythrocyte effector, 2,3-disphosphoglycerate, i.e. of decreasing its affinity for oxygen, and we have linked these polymers chemically to oxyHb. All the resulting conjugates have lower oxygen affinity than SFHb and, when injected into rats, do not lead to hemoglobinuria. Preliminary in vivo tests also showed that these conjugates possess no acute toxicity. Further experiments with rats are now under way (60% and 80% hemorrhagic shocks) with the aim of evaluating whether these new products can be regarded as potential candidates for blood substitution.\r"

The drastic reduction of the moving parts leads to greater reliability and an accurate control system can be set up. Its major limitations concern weight, heat dissipation and, finally, the overall pump efficiency which is usually rather low. We investigated the possibility of using magnetic fluids in an electromagnetic actuator. Limitations intrinsic to the magnetic fluids prevent their being used as pumping elements but they can be useful to increase the pump efficiency by reducing losses in the magnetic circuit. A remarkable increase in pump efficiency was attained. It is necessary to point out that in designing the electromagnetic actuator the focus was on the pump efficiency with and without the magnetic fluids more than on its performance.\r"

In the present study, we have investigated the ability of activated charcoals (DHP-1 and Adsorba 150C) and uncharged resin (Amberlite XAD-7) to adsorb lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various cytokines, namely tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The capacities of the adsorbents were assessed by measurement of their equilibrium adsorption isotherms for these substances labelled with 125I. There was no single adsorbent that uniformly adsorbed LPS and the cytokines from phosphate buffered saline or human plasma. DHP-1 charcoal was superior to Adsorba 150C for all substances and was the most effective adsorbent for binding LPS, IL-1 alpha and IFN-gamma. Amberlite XAD-7 resin was most effective for TNF, IL-6 and IFN-alpha, but bound little LPS, particularly from human plasma. Ultrafiltration through a membrane which retains substances of molecular weight greater than 50 kD did not filter the cytokines from human plasma, although the molecular weight of the cytokines range from 17 to 22 kD. This demonstrated that, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma readily bind to proteins and/or other large molecules in plasma.\r"

Plasma exchange is a valid tool for the treatment of acute vascular rejection, provided that it is started before irreversible graft damage occurs: 75% rejection crises were reversed by plasma exchange and the actuarial graft survival from the rejection episode was 75% at one year, 66% at two and 50% at five years. Serum creatinine before treatment and glomerular thrombosis at graft biopsy correlated with the response to plasma exchange. In sensitized patients and in those with chronic rejection the results were disappointing and suggest that in these clinical conditions plasma exchange should be used only in selected cases.\r"

The results were similar to those with polypropylene fibers. We also investigated the occurrence of hemolysis as a function of shear rate and transmembrane pressure. The free hemoglobin concentration of filtered plasma was checked using a U.V. spectrophotometer. It was concluded that polyamide membrane filters can be safely used for plasma separation from blood.\r"

  ".W": "In therapeutic plasmapheresis using cascade filtration, it is important to maximize albumin recovery while rejecting as many gamma-globulins as possible. Several membrane fractionation techniques were investigated using fresh bovine and human plasma and cellulose acetate filters (PF 100, AKZO). In dead end mode the sieving coefficients were found to decrease as transmembrane pressure increased. This was due to membrane plugging during the course of filtration after about 20 minutes which lead to a rapid increase in transmembrane pressure. In single pass mode the albumin recovery factor generally remains around 40% since the permeate flux is much less than the inlet flow. When strong pulsations (4 to 6 Hz) were superposed on the inlet plasma flow in single pass mode, the albumin sieving coefficient remained at about 0.95 while the permeate flux was increased by 106%. As a result a recovery factor of more than 80% could be sustained for at least 90 minutes without membrane plugging. Therefore pulsatile flow plasma fractionation seems to be an interesting approach to combine continuous operation with high albumin recovery.\r"

Differences in cardiovascular responses were not significantly greater for family visits than for interviews for patients with hypertension compared with those without hypertension.

We compared the effect of three combinations of the covers (head cover, body covers, both) and a control condition on tympanic temperature in 60 adults having major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The covers were applied from the time of transport to the operating room until exit from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Tympanic temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer. Between transport and PACU entry, the four groups had mean temperature decreases ranging from 1.6 degrees to 2.3 degrees F (0.9 degree to 1.3 degrees C). After controlling for background variables affecting body temperature, adjusted PACU entry temperature was higher in the two groups with aluminized body covers. Regression analysis showed that use of the body covers accounted for 7% of the temperature variance at PACU entry and predicted a 0.9 degree F (0.5 degree C) higher temperature at that time. These findings indicate that aluminized body covers help to reduce heat loss in patients having major abdominal surgery.\r"

One hundred thirty-five severely injured patients received uncrossmatched type O blood during the study period. Sixty-one patients (45%) died and 76 patients (56%) underwent emergent operation. There were no major transfusion reactions. Six patients had blood antigen-antibodies present on admission, and such antibodies developed in three patients during hospitalization.

Limiting these injuries is important. Discovering them in successfully resuscitated victims, however, is critical to long-term recovery and rehabilitation.

Vagal stimulation was applied for 90 s at 5-V pulses of 2-ms duration at frequencies of 5, 15, 25, and 35 Hz in each group (n = 6). The pouch relaxation peaked at 15 Hz. The insufflation pressure was highest at 5 Hz. Field stimulations of the same frequencies were applied on tracheal spirals and lung parenchymal strips. The maximal relaxation of the trachea occurred at 15-35 Hz. The lung parenchymal strip tensions increased almost linearly as the frequency increased from 5 to 35 Hz. The results of the study indicated a frequency-dependent response for both excitatory and inhibitory components of the NANC, which operate at different frequencies for optimal responses.\r"

We investigated whether histamine inhalation could cause refractoriness for bronchoconstriction induced by ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNDW) and whether histamine causes tachyphylaxis for a subsequent histamine challenge in nine stable asthmatic patients. Preinhalation of histamine induced a significant diminished bronchoconstrictor response to UNDW cumulative dose of inhaled UNDW causing a 20% fall in forced expired volume in 1 s. The mean increased from 3.5 +/- 0.8 to 11.8 +/- 2.6 (SE) ml after histamine challenge (P less than 0.01). However, repeated inhalation of histamine did not change the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine within 1 h after rechallenge (P greater than 0.5). The magnitude of refractoriness for UNDW inhalation after preinhalation of histamine was correlated to the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine (r = 0.73, P less than 0.05). We conclude that inhaled histamine can induce refractoriness for UNDW, which seems to be related to the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

We investigated the flow distributions predicted by two fractally branching vascular models to determine how well such networks could explain the observed heterogeneity. The distribution of flow was modeled with a dichotomously branching tree in which the fraction of blood flow from the parent to the daughter branches was gamma and 1-gamma repeatedly at each generation. In one model gamma was held constant throughout the network, and in the other model gamma varied about a mean of 0.5 with a standard deviation of sigma. Both gamma and sigma were optimized in each model for the best fit to pulmonary blood flow data from experimental animals. The predicted relative dispersion of flow from the two model fractal networks produced an excellent fit to the observed data. These fractally branching models relate structure and function of the pulmonary vascular tree and provide a mechanism to describe the spatially correlated distribution of flow and the gravity-independent heterogeneity of blood flow.\r"

Forty-seven children acclimatized to HA were compared with 101 living at low altitude (LA, 330 m). They had the same good nutritional status and the same level of physical activities [average 5.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) and 5.2 +/- 1.9 h/wk at HA and LA, respectively]. They performed the two tests using the same calibrated cycle ergometer. For the Wingate test, O2 uptake (VO2) during the 30 s and the peak of blood lactate concentration ([L]p) during the recovery were also measured. No difference in MAnP was observed between HA and LA. P, [L]p, and VO2 were lower at HA. This suggests that the altitude of 3,700 m did not affect the performance of the force-velocity test but reduced that of the Wingate test. This decrease in P was linked to a lower participation of glycolysis and aerobic metabolism. The latter is related to a reduced aerobic performance at HA. In addition, the slopes of the relationships between age and MAnP, P, and [L]p were the same at HA and LA, indicating that chronic hypoxia did not alter the development of the anaerobic metabolism during puberty.\r"

Neither physical exercise nor anabolic/androgenic steroid administration resulted in a significant change in muscle wet weight. Treatment with the anabolizing androgens increased succinate dehydrogenase activity in fast-twitch muscle mitochondria; this effect was not enhanced by training and was not observed in soleus mitochondria. On the other hand, the content of the slow-twitch muscle in sarcotubular fraction was increased in sedentary rats by fluoxymesterone or methandrostanolone treatment, whereas no significant changes were found in EDL. The training program affected adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activities in the sarcotubular fraction; Mg2(+)-ATPase was increased in both soleus and EDL, but Ca2(+)-ATPase was decreased only in soleus. However, in sedentary animals only the Mg2(+)-dependent activity of EDL was increased by anabolizing androgen treatment, and this change was not potentiated by additional training. The present data indicate that anabolic/androgenic steroids can affect mitochondrial and sarcotubular enzymes in skeletal muscle. The effects are muscle-type specific.\r"

  ".W": "Six anesthetized paralyzed open-chest New Zealand White male rabbits were studied to obtain the maximal or plateau response to the inhalation of methacholine. Tracheal flow, tracheal pressure, and, by use of alveolar capsules, alveolar pressure were measured during tidal mechanical ventilation. We calculated total lung resistance (RL), tissue viscance (Vti), and lung elastance by digital fitting of the equation of motion to changes in tracheal and alveolar pressure. Airways resistance (Raw) was calculated as RL-Vti. Measurements were made under control conditions and after delivery of increasing concentrations of methacholine aerosol (0.5-128 mg/ml). We found that Vti accounted for the major proportion of RL both under control conditions (64.5 +/- 15.9%) and after methacholine-induced constriction (83.6 +/- 11.8%). There was a significant negative correlation between logarithmic percent change in Raw and Vti at the onset of the plateau response (r = 0.973). Furthermore, the slope of the relationship between log change in Vti and log change in Raw during the plateau response was strongly correlated with the degree of tissue response at the onset of the plateau (r = 0.957). Vti was positively correlated with lung elastance both before and during the plateau response (r = 0.946). We propose that the negative correlation between tissue resistance and Raw at the level of the plateau is consistent with a model of a mechanically interdependent lung, where decreases in airway caliber are limited by the constriction of the surrounding parenchyma.\r"

  ".W": "The lumped six-element model of the respiratory system proposed by DuBois et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 8: 587-594, 1956) has often been used to analyze respiratory system impedance (Zrs) data. This model predicts a resonance (relative minimum in Zrs) at fr between 6 and 10 Hz and an antiresonance (relative maximum in Zrs) at far at higher frequencies (greater than 64 Hz). The far is due to the lumped tissue inertance (Iti) and the alveolar gas compression compliance (Cg). An fr and far have been recently reported in humans, but the far was shown to be not related to Iti and Cg, but instead it is the first acoustic antiresonance of the airways due to their axial dimensions). Zrs data to frequencies high enough to include the far have not been reported in dogs. In this study, we measured Zrs in dogs for frequencies between 5 and 320 Hz and found an fr at 7.5 +/- 1.6 Hz and two far at 97 +/- 13 and 231 +/- 27 Hz (far,1 and far,2, respectively). When breathing 80% He-20% O2, the fr shifted to 14 +/- 2 Hz, far,1 did not change (98 +/- 9 Hz), and far,2 increased to greater than 320 Hz. The behavior of fr and far,1 is consistent with the structure-function implied by the six-element model. However, the presence of an far,2 is not consistent with this model, because it is the airway acoustic antiresonance not represented in the model. These results indicate that, for frequencies that include the fr and far,1, the six-element model can be used to analyze Zrs data and reliable estimates of the model's parameters can be extracted by fitting the model to the data. However, more complex models must be used to analyze Zrs data that include far,2.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of the rib cage to chest wall elastance and hysteresis, we measured force-displacement behavior of the isolated canine rib cage during sinusoidal forcing of the sternum in the midsagittal plane at low frequencies (0.02-2.0 Hz). Elastance of the rib cage was nearly invariant with frequency of forcing from 0.02 to 1.0 Hz and decreased with increasing amplitude. Hysteresis, the width of the force-displacement loop at middisplacement (zero displacement), was nearly constant with frequency below 1.0 Hz and increased with increasing amplitude of forcing. Removal of muscle reduced elastance and hysteresis of the rib cage substantially. The data suggest that the excised dog rib cage shows dynamic behavior similar to that of the intact human rib cage and chest wall and that respiratory muscle is responsible for a major part of the behavior of the passive chest wall. We also calculated the major and minor stiffnesses in the sagittal plane, which differed by a factor of 3-11, and their directions lay close to the dorsoventral and cephalocaudal axes, respectively. Removal of muscle reduced the stiffnesses but did not change their directions. Thus, although respiratory muscles impede motion in the sagittal plane, they do not alter its pattern.\r"

Exacerbation of the hypertension could be due to further blockage of the circulation if the bubbles enlarge as a result of ingress of gas by diffusion. This mechanism has been frequently cited but lacks direct proof. To determine directly whether intravascular air bubbles actually enlarge when highly soluble and diffusible gases are inspired, we used microscopy to measure the size of gas emboli in vivo. When air bubbles were injected into the right atrium, the bubbles that appeared in pulmonary arterioles were larger during ventilation with helium or nitrous oxide than with air. Air bubbles injected into the pulmonary artery enlarged when the inspired gas was changed to helium or nitrous oxide. The direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bubble size were consistent with a net diffusion of gas into the bubbles. These data support the idea that venous air emboli enlarge during ventilation with soluble and diffusible gases and thereby cause further vascular obstruction.\r"

We hypothesized that platelets would similarly preserve membrane permeability in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model that perturbs endothelial cells by the generation of intracellular oxidants. Isolated perfused rabbit lungs (IPL) were exposed to warm ischemia-reperfusion to cause lung edema. The infusion of washed human platelets (1.05 +/- 0.02 x 10(10) cells) prevented edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, histological edema, and preservation of paraendothelial cell tight junctions. Inhibition of the platelet glutathione redox cycle with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, dehydroepiandrosterone, or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene interfered with platelet protective effects. In contrast, inhibition of platelet catalase with aminotriazole and H2O2 had no effect on platelet protection. Lung tissue malonyldialdehyde concentrations were similar in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion with or without the infusion of platelets. These results indicate that platelet attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion lung edema depends on platelet glutathione redox cycle antioxidants but not platelet catalase.\r"

We performed ID studies in which the dependence of PSU and PSB on flow, hematocrit, and plasma protein binding were examined. Measurements of PSU and PSB after flow and hematocrit were changed suggested that these factors have no significant independent effects.

Each animal ran at identical external work loads that corresponded to 65% of the heart rate reserve (210-220 beats/min) for the two exercise bouts. Cardiac outputs and stroke volumes were higher and heart rates lower for fed than for fasting runs (P less than 0.05). Preexercise feeding did not alter oxygen consumption, core temperature, mean arterial pressure, and arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference during prolonged exercise; however, mixed venous lactate concentration was lower at end exercise than during fasting conditions (1.2 vs. 2.6 mM, P less than 0.05). Microsphere measurements of regional blood flow revealed significantly higher total gastrointestinal flow (23%) for fed than for fasting conditions. Throughout the exercise bout, blood flow to the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and tibialis anterior muscles was lower in fed than in fasted animals (P less than 0.05). Combined hindlimb muscle blood flow averaged 15 ml.min-1.100 g-1 (18%, P less than 0.05) lower under feeding than fasting run conditions. These findings provide further evidence that cardiovascular reflexes originate in the gut after feeding to increase cardiac output and redistribute a portion of the blood flow away from active muscle to the gastrointestinal tract during prolonged exercise.\r"

Two sets of experiments were conducted. In the initial set (n = 8), three levels of Hb [5.8 +/- 0.3, 9.4 +/- 0.1, and 14.4 +/- 0.6 (SE) g/100 ml] in the blood were used in random order to pump perfuse, at equal muscle blood flows and PaO2, maximally working isolated dog gastrocnemius muscle. VO2max declined with decreasing [Hb], but the relationship between VO2max and both the effluent venous PO2 (PvO2) and the calculated mean capillary PO2 (PcO2) was not linear through the origin and, therefore, not compatible with a single value of DmO2 (as calculated by Bohr integration using a model based on Fick's law of diffusion). To clarify these results, a second set of experiments (n = 6) was conducted in which two levels of Hb (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 g/100 ml) were each combined with two levels of oxygenation (PaO2 79 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 2 Torr) and applied in random sequence to again pump perfuse maximally working dog gastrocnemius muscle at constant blood flow. In these experiments, the relationship between VO2max and both PvO2 and calculated PcO2 for each [Hb] was consistent with a constant estimate of DmO2 as PaO2 was reduced, but the calculated DmO2 for the lower [Hb] was 33% less than that at the higher [Hb] (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether intact cardiac innervation and a normal cardiovascular (CV) response are required for a normal ventilatory (VE) response to mild and moderate treadmill exercise in awake goats. Accordingly, we measured CV and respiratory responses to two levels of exercise in seven normal (N) and six cardiac-denervated (CD) goats. Evidence of surgical CD included 1) absence of a cardiac response during surgery when the left thoracic cardiac nerves, thoracic vagi, and right and left stellate ganglia were electrically stimulated, 2) total and 80% attenuation of baroreflex changes in heart rate (HR) when arterial blood pressure was raised or lowered, respectively, by infusion of vasoactive agents in awake goats, and 3) attenuation of the CV responses to exercise. At each level of exercise in the CD goats, the HR response was significantly reduced relative to the response observed before CD (P less than 0.05) and the recovery HR response was delayed. Cardiac index increased in a work rate-dependent manner in N and CD goats but was significantly lower in the CD animals (P less than 0.05). Hypotension was consistently observed during exercise following CD. There was no effect of CD on steady-state VE at any metabolic rate or on the VE-O2 uptake relationship (P greater than 0.05). The rest-to-work and work-to-work transition responses of arterial PCO2 were similar between N and CD goats, but there was a tendency toward greater hypocapnia at the exercise onset in CD goats at the highest work rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that neutrophil sequestration is required for the development of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) induced neutrophil- (PMN) dependent pulmonary edema. TNF (3.2 X 10(5) U/kg ip) was injected into guinea pigs 18 h before lung isolation. After isolation, the lung was perfused with a phosphate-buffered Ringer solution. Dextran sulfate (mol wt 500,000) prevented the changes in pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc; 8.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 12.8 +/- 0.8 cmH2O), lung weight gain (dW; +0.240 +/- 0.135 vs. +1.951 +/- 0.311 g), and pulmonary edema formation or wet-to-dry wt ratio [(W - D)/D; 6.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.5] at 60 min induced by PMN infusion into a TNF-pretreated lung. The unsulfated form of dextran had no protective effect [Ppc, dW, and (W - D)/D at 60 min: 11.9 +/- 0.9 cmH2O, +1.650 +/- 0.255 g, and 7.3 +/- 0.2, respectively], whereas the use of another anionic compound, heparin, inhibited the TNF + PMN response [Ppc, dW, and (W - D)/D at 60 min: 5.6 +/- 0.4 cmH2O, +0.168 +/- 0.0.052 g, and 6.4 +/- 0.2, respectively]. Isolated lungs showed increased PMN myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity compared with control in TNF-treated lungs at baseline and 60 min after PMN infusion. Dextran sulfate, dextran, and heparin inhibited the increase in MPO activity. The data indicate that inhibition of PMN sequestration alone is not sufficient for the inhibition of PMN-mediated TNF-induced hydrostatic pulmonary edema and that a charge-dependent mechanism mediates the protective effect of dextran sulfate.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial O2 delivery during short-term submaximal exercise falls on arrival at high altitude but thereafter remains constant. As arterial O2 content increases with acclimatization, blood flow falls. We evaluated several factors that could influence O2 delivery during more prolonged submaximal exercise after acclimatization at 4,300 m. Seven men (23 +/- 2 yr) performed 45 min of steady-state submaximal exercise at sea level (barometric pressure 751 Torr), on acute ascent to 4,300 m (barometric pressure 463 Torr), and after 21 days of residence at altitude. The O2 uptake (VO2) was constant during exercise, 51 +/- 1% of maximal VO2 at sea level, and 65 +/- 2% VO2 at 4,300 m. After acclimatization, exercise cardiac output decreased 25 +/- 3% compared with arrival and leg blood flow decreased 18 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), with no change in the percentage of cardiac output to the leg. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial O2 saturation increased, but total body and leg O2 delivery remained unchanged. After acclimatization, a reduction in plasma volume was offset by an increase in erythrocyte volume, and total blood volume did not change. Mean systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and leg vascular resistance were all greater after acclimatization (P less than 0.05). Mean plasma norepinephrine levels also increased during exercise in a parallel fashion with increased vascular resistance. Thus we conclude that both total body and leg O2 delivery decrease after arrival at 4,300 m and remain unchanged with acclimatization as a result of a parallel fall in both cardiac output and leg blood flow and an increase in arterial O2 content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hamsters were exposed for 45 min to 0.9-micron fluorescent latex particles either at rest (n = 9) or while running on a laddermill (n = 9). Oxygen consumption, which was used to estimate minute ventilation, was continuously monitored. Three animals from each group, rest and exercise, were killed at 10 min, 24 h, or 7 days after the exposure. Morphometric techniques were used to determine the number of particles retained in nose and oropharynx (NOSE), trachea and extrapulmonary airways, intrapulmonary conducting airways, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts (AD), and alveoli (ALV). At 10 min, total particle retention increased linearly as a function of O2 consumption (slope = 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) particles.ml-1.g-1.h-1, P less than 0.015). Exercised hamsters retained 4.4 times more total particles in their NOSE than rested hamsters, but parenchymal retention (AD + ALV) was unaffected. After 7 days, 95% of the particles were cleared from the NOSE, 80% from the trachea and extrapulmonary airways, 44% from intrapulmonary conducting airways and respiratory bronchioles, and 16% from AD and ALV. There was evidence of particle redistribution from AD to ALV during the 1st day. We conclude that exercise enhances the deposition of 0.9-micron particles in the upper respiratory tract but not in the parenchyma. Subsequently, the deposited particles are cleared at varying rates depending on the lung compartment.\r"

  ".W": "Pregnant rats were kept at a simulated altitude of 4,500 m (PO2 91 Torr) for the whole of gestation and returned to sea level 1 day after giving birth. During pregnancy, body weight gain and food intake were approximately 30% less than in controls at sea level. Measurements were made on the 1-day-old (HYPO) pups after a few hours at sea level. In normoxia, ventilation (VE) measured by flow plethysmography was more (+17%) and O2 consumption (VO2) measured by a manometric method was less (-19%) than in control (CONT) pups; in HYPO pups VE/VO2 was 44% greater than in CONT pups. In acute hyperoxia, VE/VO2 of HYPO and CONT pups decreased by a similar amount (15-20%), indicating some limitation in O2 availability for both groups of pups in normoxia. However, VE/VO2 of HYPO pups, even in hyperoxia, remained above (+34%) that of CONT pups. HYPO pups weighed slightly less than CONT pups, their lungs were hypoplastic, and their hearts were a larger fraction of body weight. An additional group of female rats was acclimatized (8 days) to high altitude before insemination. During pregnancy, body weight gain and food intake of these females were similar to those of pregnant rats at sea level. Measurements on the 1-day-old pups of this group were similar to those of HYPO pups. We conclude that newborn rats born after hypoxic gestation present metabolic adaptation (low VO2) and acclimatization (high VE/VO2), possibly because of hypoxemia. Maternal acclimatization before insemination substantially alters maternal growth in hypoxia but does not affect neonatal outcome.\r"

This work establishes a technique whereby average values for the equilibrium modulus of excised tracheal cartilage rings can be obtained. An apparatus was designed to apply preset deformations to a tracheal segment and to monitor the deforming force. Segments of four human tracheae obtained postmortem and containing three rings were mounted in the apparatus after being stripped of posterior membrane. The load-deformation behavior was analyzed with a model on the basis of thin curved beam theory. Agreement between predicted deformed shapes and those observed was good in three of the four cases and in the case of a short length of longitudinally split rubber tube. The technique is suitable for comparing mechanical properties of cartilage before and after an intervention.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that administration of allopurinol could modify the response to prolonged hyperoxia in premature baboons (140 days gestation) with respiratory distress syndrome, we evaluated physiological, pathological, and lung biochemical parameters in groups of premature baboons treated with mechanical ventilation and exposed to various amounts of oxygen for 6 days. Three groups of experimental animals were studied, including animals that received oxygen as needed to maintain arterial oxygen between 60 and 80 Torr [inspiratory O2 concentration- (FIO2) PRN], animals that received 100% oxygen continuously but also received allopurinol intravenously at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1.day-1 (FIO2-1.0 + allopurinol), and animals that received 100% oxygen continuously and the vehicle for allopurinol administration (FIO2-1.0). Pathological examinations of the experimental animals showed evidence of lung injury in both 100% oxygen-exposed groups, but the allopurinol-treated animals had findings more compatible with the FIO2-PRN group, with relatively few macrophages or polymorphonuclear lymphocytes being present in lung tissue. Lungs of animals treated with allopurinol were also more distensible and had a trend toward decreased lung water compared with the FIO2-1.0 group. Allopurinol-treated animals were able to induce lung glutathione concentrations and glutathione-related and antioxidant enzyme activities compared with the normoxic control (FIO2-PRN) group. Ventilator pressure requirements were also decreased in the allopurinol-treated animals compared with the FIO2-1.0 controls after 42 h. These data suggest that treatment of hyperoxia-exposed premature baboons with allopurinol for the first 6 days of life results in significant changes in lung responses and antioxidant defenses compared with vehicle-treated baboons exposed to 100% oxygen for the same time period.\r"

Such capsaicin treatment ablates a subpopulation of primary afferent fibers containing substance P and various other neuropeptides. Ventilation was measured while the rats breathed air, 12% O2 in N2, 8% O2 in N2, 5% CO2 in O2, or 8% CO2 in O2. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin caused marked alterations in both the magnitude and composition of the hypoxic but not hypercapnic ventilatory response. The increase in minute ventilation evoked by hypoxia in the vehicle-treated rats resulted entirely from an increase in respiratory frequency. In the capsaicin-treated rats the hypoxic ventilatory response was significantly reduced owing to an attenuation of the frequency response. Although both groups responded to hypoxia with a shortening in inspiratory and expiratory times, rats treated with capsaicin displayed less shortening of both respiratory phases. By contrast, hypercapnia induced a brisk ventilatory response in the capsaicin-treated group that was similar in magnitude and pattern to that observed in the vehicle-treated group. Analysis of the components of the hypercapnic ventilatory responses revealed no significant differences between the two groups. We, therefore, conclude that neuropeptide-containing C-fibers are essential for the tachypnic component of the ventilatory response to hypoxia but not hypercapnia.\r"

The chronotropic and dromotropic responses to dynamic exercise were compared with and without selective muscarinic (atropine) and/or beta-adrenergic (timolol) blockade. With the SAN intact, cardiac acceleration was prompt during onset of exercise and in proportion to work intensity. Immediately after SAN excision (1-7 days), pacemaker activity exhibited marked instability in rate and pacemaker location, with rapid shifts between atrial and junctional foci. Soon thereafter (1-2 wk), subsidiary atrial pacemakers (SAPs) assumed the primary pacemaker function. Although the SAP foci demonstrated stable heart rates and atrioventricular (AV) intervals at rest and during exercise, heart rates at rest and during steady-state exercise were reduced 34% from corresponding levels in the SAN-intact state, both with and without selective autonomic blockade. For control of dromotropic function, animals with SAP foci showed pronounced shortening in AV interval in conjunction with exercise that was further exacerbated by pretreatment with atropine. Eight weeks after excision of the primary SAN pacemakers, direct electrophysiological mapping localized the SAP foci to either the inferior right atrium along the sulcus terminalis or the dorsal cranial right atrium (in or near Bachmann's bundle). Animals with SAPs localized to the inferior right atrium had a more marked suppression in heart rate with a corresponding greater decrease in AV interval during exercise than dogs with SAP foci identified within the dorsal cranial right atrium.\r"

Reversal of this decrease by vasodilators or the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegral has been shown to result in enhanced lung inflammation. In the present study the mechanisms underlying the decrease in flow in pulmonary inflammation were investigated in the rabbit in vivo and in the isolated blood-perfused rabbit lung. In vivo, the decrease in local blood flow was shown to be dependent on circulating neutrophils. In the isolated blood-perfused lung, inflammation induced by airway instillation of C5a was similar histologically to that seen in vivo and was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow. The decrease in blood flow appeared to require circulating neutrophils and was prevented by dazmegral and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB 2086 and L-659,989. Furthermore, no decrease occurred in aspirin-treated lungs perfused with normal blood, suggesting that the source of thromboxane was lung rather than circulating cells. The decrease in blood flow in inflammation did not appear to be a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Inflammation in the guinea pig lung was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow and was also prevented by dazmegral and PAF antagonists. We conclude that local inflammation in the lung is accompanied by a decrease in blood flow that involves neutrophils and the lipid mediators PAF and thromboxane. We suggest that this form of negative feedback by the neutrophil serves to control the inflammatory response.\r"

The diaphragmatic activities were always synchronous and the amplitudes and rates of rise were similar during slow-wave sleep. In contrast, during natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, different activity was often present in the two leads. These differences were in the time of onset and offset, as well as in the amplitude and spike patterns, and occurred in approximately 5-20% of the diaphragmatic bursts averaged over the entire REM sleep period. With respect to eye movement density, the rate of differential activation was higher during periods of high density (26%) than in the absence of eye movements (1%) in the four animals for which these data were available. Differential activation of portions of the costal diaphragm is apparently a normal event of REM sleep. This could result from descending state-specific phasic neuronal activity that bypasses the medullary respiratory generator. Differential activation of portions of the diaphragm could contribute to disordered ventilation during REM sleep.\r"

The range of MVC was similar in both groups. Force production was recorded, and intracellular concentrations of phosphorus compounds and pH were measured in the flexor digitorum profundus of the active forearm. At exercise intensities greater than or equal to 50% MVC, changes in concentrations of high-energy phosphate metabolites were abnormal in PFKD. During maximal effort, [ADP], calculated from the creatine kinase reaction, was 64.3 +/- 13.5 (SE) mumol/kg in PFKD vs. 25.7 +/- 4.0 in HS (P less than 0.05). Ammonia (NH3), a product of AMP deamination and an index of muscle [AMP], increased approximately twofold more in venous effluent during maximal forearm exercise in PFKD than in HS (P less than 0.05).

During strenuous exercise, PFKD patients exhibit an impairment in the rephosphorylation of ADP related to a subnormal oxidative capacity, an absence of glycolysis, and an attenuated breakdown of phosphocreatine.\r"

One mechanism to account for this accumulation of alveolar macrophages may be an increase in the migration of blood monocytes into the lungs of smokers. To evaluate this hypothesis, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 15 smokers and 16 nonsmokers. The smokers' BALF possessed a significantly increased capacity to attract normal blood monocytes when evaluated using a blind-well chamber technique (26.2 +/- 7.6 vs 14.8 +/- 6.9 cells/high-power field, P less than 0.01). Checkerboard analysis of the activity revealed that it was predominantly chemokinetic. Partial characterization of the activity in smokers' BALF revealed that it was lipid soluble but only partially sensitive to trypsin and heat. The chemokinetic activity correlated with alveolar macrophage numbers in the BALF (r = 0.4391, P = 0.009). Furthermore, both the chemokinetic activity and alveolar macrophage number correlated with alterations of respiratory function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and forced expiratory flow at 75% of the vital capacity). These results suggest that the increase in alveolar macrophage number present in the BALF of cigarette smokers may be due, at least in part, to an increased amount of chemokinetic factor(s) in the smokers' BALF, and these factor(s) may participate in the decline of respiratory function associated with cigarette smoking, probably by recruiting monocytes into lung.\r"

Airway opening pressure (Pao) during superfusion was monitored and the superfusate collected for analysis of SP- and NKA-like immunoreactivities (SP-LI and NKA-LI, respectively). Peak Pao (39.0 +/- 3.9 cmH2O) was reached 10 min after starting superfusion; Pao decreased slowly thereafter, reaching only 9.9 +/- 2.2% of the peak value 2 h after starting superfusion (P less than 0.005); 12.6 +/- 2.6 and 34.0 +/- 9.7 fmol of SP-LI and NKA-LI, respectively, were found in the fraction corresponding to 10-20 min of superfusion. Recovered immunoreactivities decreased to 5.2 +/- 0.3 and 9.3 +/- 1.8 fmol of SP-LI and NKA-LI, respectively, in the fraction corresponding to 110-120 min of superfusion (P less than 0.05). Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase with thiorphan resulted in significantly greater increases in Pao (P less than 0.005) and augmentation of the recovery of SP-LI and NKA-LI (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Capsaicin treatment of animals 7-10 days before the removal of their lungs abolished the increase in Pao during superfusion and resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of SP-LI and NKA-LI recovered. Our data confirm that tachykinin release occurs during postmortem bronchoconstriction in guinea pig lungs and, furthermore, that tachykinin degradation by NEP modulates the intensity of this response.\r"

  ".W": "Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were readily (within 1 h) depleted of their glutathione (GSH) by diethylmaleate (0.1-1.0 mM), but dose-dependent cell detachment was noted. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 25 microM) depleted cell GSH with sigmoidal kinetics, showing an initial half-life of depletion of 4-6 h and greater than 95% depletion by 48 h without morphological changes to the cells. However, BSO-dependent depletion of cell GSH was only partially reversible by cell washing and reincubation with complete medium. Likewise, incubation of the cells in sulfur-free medium depleted cell GSH again without morphological changes to the cells. However, unlike with BSO, these cells readily resynthesized GSH when resupplied with complete medium, fresh plasma, or whole blood, with a characteristic overloading of cell GSH (up to 200%) by 12 h. By use of the sulfur-free medium, it was shown that both cystine and cysteine are effective precursors to GSH synthesis in HUVE cells in culture and that cystine is the most likely precursor in vivo. During cystine-supported resynthesis of GSH, high levels of cysteine accumulated in the cells (up to 10% of total soluble free thiol). Physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular GSH were not as effective as cystine or cysteine in stimulating GSH biosynthesis, whereas nonphysiologically high (mM) concentrations resulted in substantial elevation of GSH levels above those of control cells in a BSO-insensitive manner. These findings provide a simple methodology for the manipulation of HUVE cell GSH in studies of endothelial-specific oxidant toxicity and the sulfur dependence of the biochemistry and turnover of GSH in these human cells.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary vascular responses to endothelin (ET-1), a peptide derived from endothelial cells in culture, were investigated in the ovine fetus delivered by cesarean section from chloralose-anesthetized ewes with intact umbilical circulation. Circulation to the lower left lobe of the fetal lung was isolated in situ and perfused at constant flow with blood withdrawn from the inferior vena cava. Injection of graded doses of ET-1 into the left pulmonary artery decreased pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. At doses of 100, 300, and 1,000 ng, pulmonary vascular resistance per kilogram body weight (PVR/kg) was decreased 30, 40, and 42%, respectively. However, when fetuses were ventilated with 100% oxygen, 100- and 300-ng doses of ET-1 decreased PVR/kg by 5 and 9%, respectively. In contrast, injection of 1,000 ng of ET-1 resulted in a reversal of the response, and PVR/kg was increased by 70%. Ventilation of the right lung alone resulted in a similar reversal of the vasodilator response to 1,000 ng of ET-1, and a 138% increase in PVR/kg was recorded. These studies demonstrate for the first time that ET-1 has vasodilator activity in the normally high-tone ovine fetal pulmonary circulation. In addition, these results show that ET-1 has vasoconstrictor activity in the newly ventilated low-tone pulmonary vasculature. The present data indicate the pulmonary vascular responses to ET-1 are tone dependent in the ovine fetal pulmonary circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Although volumetric displacements of the chest wall are often analyzed in terms of two independent parallel pathways (rib cage and abdomen), Loring and Mead have argued that these pathways are not mechanically independent (J. Appl. Physiol. 53: 756-760, 1982). Because of its apposition with the diaphragm, the rib cage is exposed to two distinct pressure differences, one of which depends on abdominal pressure. Using the analysis of Loring and Mead as a point of departure, we developed a complementary analysis in which mechanical coupling of the rib cage, abdomen, and diaphragm is modeled by a linear translational transformer. This model has the advantage that it possesses a precise electrical analogue. Pressure differences and compartmental displacements are related by the transformation ratio (n), which is the mechanical advantage of abdominal over pleural pressure changes in displacing the rib cage. In the limiting case of very high lung volume, n----0 and the pathways uncouple. In the limit of very small lung volume, n----infinity and the pathways remain coupled; both rib cage and abdomen are driven by abdominal pressure alone, in accord with the Goldman-Mead hypothesis. A good fit was obtained between the model and the previously reported data for the human chest wall from 0.5 to 4 Hz (J. Appl. Physiol. 66:350-359, 1989). The model was then used to estimate rib cage, diaphragm, and abdominal elastance, resistance, and inertance. The abdomen was a high-elastance high-inertance highly damped compartment, and the rib cage a low-elastance low-inertance more lightly damped compartment. Our estimate that n = 1.9 is consistent with the findings of Loring and Mead and suggests substantial pathway coupling.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism, insulin action on whole body glucose uptake rate (WBGUR) and leg glucose uptake rate (LGUR) was measured by sequential euglycemic clamp technique combined with femoral arterial and venous cannulation at insulin concentrations of 10 +/- 1, 18 +/- 1, 37 +/- 2, and 360 +/- 15 microU/ml. Studies were performed before (C) and after (BR) 7 days of strict bed rest. WBGUR was significantly lower after bed rest than before (5.5 +/- 0.4 and 7.2 +/- 0.8 mg.min-1.kg-1, respectively) when insulin was 37 microU/ml. LGUR was even more markedly depressed by bed rest, being 0.6 +/- 0.1, 0.9 +/- 0.2, and 2.8 +/- 0.4 mg.min-1.kg leg-1 (BR) compared with 0.9 +/- 0.1, 1.7 +/- 0.4, and 5.9 +/- 0.5 mg.min-1.kg leg-1 (C) (P less than 0.05) at the three lower insulin concentrations. At these insulin concentrations also, lactate release and glucose oxidation and glycogen storage estimated by indirect calorimetry were lower in the leg after bed rest. At the highest insulin dose WBGUR was similar on BR and C days, while LGUR was lower after bed rest. In conclusion, 7 days of bed rest decrease whole body insulin action, a fact that is explained by decreased insulin action in inactive muscle.\r"

By light microscopy, we measured the percent muscle thickness (%MT) and peripheral muscularization of pulmonary arteries and veins from 25 lambs aged less than 24 h, 2-4 days, 2 wk, and 1 mo. At the same ages, lungs were isolated and perfused in situ and, after cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin, total, arterial (delta Pa), middle (delta Pm), and venous pressure gradients at inspired O2 fractions of 0.28 (mild hyperoxia) and 0.04 (hypoxia) were determined with inflow-outflow occlusion. During mild hyperoxia, delta Pa and delta Pm fell significantly between 2-4 days and 2 wk, whereas during hypoxia, only delta Pm fell. The %MT of all arteries (less than 50 to greater than 1,000 microns diam) decreased, and peripheral muscularization of less than 100-microns-diam arteries fell between less than 4 days and greater than 2 wk. Our data suggest that 1) the %MT of arteries determines normoxic pulmonary vascular resistance, because only arterial and middle segment resistance fell, 2) peripheral muscularization is a major determinant of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, because we observed a fall with age in peripheral muscularization of less than 100-micron-diam arteries and in delta Pm with hypoxia, and 3) the arterial limit of the middle segment defined by inflow-outflow occlusion lies in 100- to 1,000-microns-diam arteries.\r"

Activities of the phrenic nerve and medullary respiratory neurons were recorded. Antidromic invasion was used to define bulbospinal, laryngeal, or not antidromically activated units. The ventilatory pattern was reversibly altered to gasping by exposure to 1% carbon monoxide in air. In eupnea, activities of inspiratory neurons commenced at various times during inspiration, and for most the discharge frequency gradually increased. In gasping, the peak discharge frequency of inspiratory neurons was unaltered. However, all commenced activities at the start of the phrenic burst and reached peak discharge almost immediately. The discharge frequencies of all groups of expiratory neurons fell in gasping, with many neurons ceasing activity entirely. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that brain stem mechanisms controlling eupnea and gasping differ fundamentally.\r"

And does prior exercise training, which may increase muscle strength, affect this response to restraint? To answer those questions, we measured breathing pattern in 11 adult male hamsters while they were either 1) free to move in small cages or 2) closely restrained in head-out cones. The measurements were repeated after hamsters spent 6 wk either sedentary in standard cages or in cages with exercise wheels. Hamsters were placed in a plethysmograph to measure respiratory frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT). Their product is minute volume (V). When restrained, f and V were 1.9 and 1.7 times, respectively, greater than when hamsters were free, but VT did not change. After 6 wk, the sedentary group responded differently to restraint; f increased 3-fold, VT decreased by one-half, and V increased 1.6-fold. Exercised hamsters increased f 2.3-fold and decreased VT by one-third; V increased by 1.5-fold. In inhalation studies, changes in breathing pattern would significantly influence the amount of material inhaled, the fraction retained, and thus the amount and distribution of material deposited in the lungs.\r"

  ".W": "Because the detection of added loads is a function of the step change in load relative to background level of load (Weber's law), we reasoned that detection may be delayed if the load is increased in very small steps over a protracted period. This would permit the study of subliminal load responses over a greater range than would otherwise be possible. In 13 healthy males, an external elastic load (delta E) was added in very small steps (load increased every few seconds) such that delta E increased from zero to 6.0 cmH2O/l in 18 min. Each subject underwent a control study in which an identical protocol was followed but no load was added. Five subjects sensed the load after a variable period of load application. Their results were discarded. In the remaining eight subjects, there was no perception of increased load throughout the 18 min. By comparison with the control studies in the same subjects, there was a progressive reduction in tidal volume and breath duration with loading. To assess the response to an increase in load associated with perception, in five of the eight \"nonsensers\" the load was suddenly doubled (delta E = 6 cmH2O/l) at the end of the 18 min of progressive nonsensed loading. This evoked perception in all subjects and was associated with highly variable responses in tidal volume and breath duration. We conclude that tachypnea associated with elastic loading in conscious humans is a reflex response that is facilitated by consciousness but does not require perception.\r"

This is, in part, due to the lack of an animal model of load detection that could be used to investigate specific sensory systems. We used American Foxhounds with tracheal stomata to behaviorally condition the detection of inspiratory occlusion and graded resistive loads. The resistive loads were presented with a loading manifold connected to the inspiratory port of a non-rebreathing valve. The dogs signaled detection of the load by lifting their front paw off a lever. Inspiratory occlusion was used as the initial training stimulus, and the dogs could reliably respond within the first or second inspiratory effort to 100% of the occlusion presentations after 13 trials. Graded resistances that spanned the 50% detection threshold were then presented. The detection threshold resistances (delta R50) were 0.96 and 1.70 cmH2O.l-1.s. Ratios of delta R50 to background resistance were 0.15 and 0.30. The near-threshold resistive loads did not significantly change expired PCO2 or breathing patterns. These results demonstrate that dogs can be conditioned to reliably and specifically signal the detection of graded inspiratory mechanical loads. Inspiration through the tracheal stoma excludes afferents in the upper extrathoracic trachea, larynx, pharynx, nasal passages, and mouth from mediating load detection in these dogs. It is unknown which remaining afferents (vagal or respiratory muscle) are responsible for load detection.\r"

The variability of the compatible solutions was examined by determining the standard deviation of the statistical average. For six inert gases, it can be predicted that a distribution with up to seven contiguous nonzero VA/Q compartments can be uniquely recovered, whereas the compatible family becomes more diverse, the broader the distribution. For a given compatible family consisting of multimodal distributions with various phase relationships, the average distribution was found to display an uncharacteristically unimodal shape as a result of modal smoothing. To avoid this possible artifact, an alternative approach was adopted in which statistical averaging was performed in the frequency domain. For both deterministic and empirical data, the energy spectra of all feasible VA/Q distributions displayed a well-defined low-frequency band that was invariant within the compatible family and with a bandwidth that approximated the predicted sampling cutoff frequency. The nonuniqueness of the result was ascribable to a variable high-frequency band that was due to an aliasing effect. For a wide range of clinical data, the representative distributions resulting from compartmental and spectral averaging were indistinguishable from each other and had little variability both in the VA/Q and frequency domains. For these cases, therefore, the resolving power of the recovery algorithm was not critical. Finally, an efficient method of finding the average distribution was proposed.\r"

On the air-filled pressure-volume curve, decreases of lung volume from control level were significantly higher at 3-8 cmH2O pressure on day 10 than on day 30. Because the change of lung tissue elasticity evaluated from the saline-filled pressure-volume curve was equal for the 2 days, the higher decrease of air volume on day 10 was due primarily to contribution of alveolar surface force. Pressure differences between deflation limbs of air-filled and saline-filled pressure-volume curves, which represented net alveolar surface force, were significantly higher at any lung volume between 50 and 90% total lung capacity on day 10, but almost no significance was observed on day 30. Phospholipid concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly decreased on day 10 but had improved by day 30. Analysis of phospholipid species in purified lung surfactant showed decreased fractions of disaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol on day 10. Surface-active properties of the surfactant, measured by a modified Wilhelmy balance, were remarkably hampered on day 10, but most of them had improved by day 30. We consider that the quantitative and functional abnormalities of lung surfactant have a part in the aggravation of lung mechanics in the acute phase of pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

In this study we have examined the potential importance of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange as a mechanism for Ca2+ influx during the contractile process by studying the effect of inhibition or stimulation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Blockade of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange with amiloride attenuated the twitch response, altered the force-frequency response curve, and enhanced the development of fatigue. The effect of amiloride could be partially reversed by increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The ability of amiloride to decrease force was associated with decreased Ca2+ uptake by the diaphragm. Enhancing intracellular Na(+)-extracellular Ca2+ exchange by inhibiting the Na(+)-K+ pump significantly decreased the rate of the development of muscle fatigue (89%). The maximal inhibition of diaphragmatic force produced by the amiloride analogue benzamil, which possesses 10-fold greater selectivity for Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange, was not significantly different from that produced by amiloride (76.2 +/- 1.1%), with a concentration that decreased maximum force by 50% equal to 46 microM compared with 460 microM for amiloride. Both agents slowed the maximal rate of relaxation up to 90%. Benzamil elevated resting tension during continuous stimulation of the diaphragm at 0.15 Hz. The results suggest that Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange may have a role in the normal function of the diaphragm.\r"

  ".W": "The pulmonary circulation in the adult is characterized by being relatively distensible, but whether the newborn lung shares this feature is less certain. We perfused isolated lungs treated with indomethacin from lambs of four ages (less than 1, 2-4, 12-14, and 30-32 days) to determine the effects of increasing left atrial pressure on the pulmonary vascular pressures measured by vascular inflow and outflow occlusion. An index of pulmonary vascular distensibility was assessed by comparing the slope of the pulmonary vascular pressure at the upstream end of a region as a function of the pressure at the downstream end of the region. A vascular distensibility index (VDI) of 1 indicates a rigid nondistensible system, whereas a VDI less than 1 indicates some degree of distensibility. During normoxia, lungs from all age groups were relatively indistensible as determined by VDI for the total vasculature (VDItotal) as well as for the different regions based on occlusion pressures (VDIarterial, VDImiddle, and VDIvenous). There were significant effects of age on the VDItotal, with decreases in the normoxic values occurring over the first 12-14 days of age, indicating an increase in pulmonary vascular distensibility. Only the VDIvenous was similarly affected by increasing neonatal age. Hypoxia significantly reduced the VDItotal in these same age groups. In addition, hypoxia, which increased the pressure gradients of the arterial and middle regions, significantly increased the VDIarterial in the youngest and oldest age groups but significantly decreased the VDImiddle at all ages by approximately 50%. In summary, we observed age-related changes in the vascular distensibility of the pulmonary circulation, with the VDItotal decreasing with increasing postnatal age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that cocaine (C) alters the normal physiological responses to exercise. Male rats were injected with saline (S) or C (12.5 mg/kg) either intravenously (iv) or intraperitoneally (ip). After injection the animals were allowed to rest for 30 min or were run on the treadmill (26 m/min, 10% grade). At rest plasma epinephrine values were 245 +/- 24 pg/ml in the S group and 411 +/- 43 (ip) and 612 +/- 41 (iv) pg/ml in the C groups (P less than 0.05 between S and C). During exercise plasma epinephrine levels were 615 +/- 32 pg/ml in S and 1,316 +/- 58 (ip) and 1,208 +/- 37 (iv) pg/ml in the C groups (P less than 0.05 between S and C). Similar results were obtained for norepinephrine. Glycogen content in the white vastus lateralis muscle was reduced to 31 +/- 2 mumol/g in S after exercise, but after C and exercise the values were 12 +/- 4 (ip) and 16 +/- 3 (iv) mumol/g (P less than 0.05 between S and C). There was no effect of the drug on this parameter at rest. Blood lactate rose to 4.8 +/- 1.0 (ip) and 5.8 +/- 1.3 (iv) mM in the C groups but to only 3.0 +/- 0.2 in the S group after exercise (P less than 0.05 between S and C). These results show that C and exercise combined exert a more dramatic effect on plasma catecholamine, muscle glycogen, and blood lactate concentrations than do C and exercise alone. They provide further insight into explaining the adverse effects of C on exercise endurance observed previously (Bracken et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 377-383, 1989).\r"

  ".W": "Both inspiratory increases and tonic thoracic traction (pull of the thorax) on the trachea [Ttx(tr)] have been shown to improve patency of the upper airway. To evaluate the origins and magnitude of Ttx(tr), we studied 15 anesthetized tracheotomized dogs. We divided the midcervical trachea and attached the thoracic stub to a strain gauge. Ttx(tr), esophageal pressure, and carinal displacement were observed during various conditions. These included unobstructed and obstructed spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation at various levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and progressive hypercapnic stimulation. Observations during spontaneous breathing were performed before and after vagotomy. We found that inspiratory increases in Ttx(tr) were substantial, averaging 81 +/- 8 g force and increasing to 174 +/- 22 g force at an end-expiratory CO2 concentration of 10%. Ttx(tr) did not result simply from the pull of mediastinal and pulmonary structures transmitted through the carina. Changes in intrathoracic pressure acted independently to either draw the trachea into or push the trachea out of the thorax. Thus Ttx(tr) could be explained as the sum of mediastinal traction and force generated by changes in intrathoracic pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of fasting on energy utilization during running or swimming was studied in adult male Wistar rats. Compared with fed rats, fasted animals displayed a decreased contribution of carbohydrates in energy supply, with decreased liver and muscle glycogen contents and decreased rate of glycogen breakdown. This was compensated by an enhanced rate of beta-oxidation. In addition, fasting induced an exaggerated sympathoadrenal response during exercise, reflected by a greater epinephrine plasma level and a higher norepinephrine turnover rate in both liver and soleus. Nevertheless, endurance capacity was similar in fasted and fed animals. These results contrast with the impairment of endurance observed in fasting humans but also with the improvement of endurance in rats previously reported by Dohm et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 830-833, 1983). These data suggest that the metabolic responses to exercise subsequent to food deprivation depend not only on the considered species but also, in the same species (rat), on the age of the animals and the duration of the fast. These factors probably determine the hormonal secretion and substrate utilization during prolonged exercise in fasting conditions.\r"

Eight subjects were studied at a postconceptional age of 40 +/- 1.6 (SD) wk (range 38-43 wk) during spontaneous sleep. Sleep stages were defined on the basis of electrophysiological and behavioral criteria, and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activity was recorded by cutaneous electrodes. The responses to CO2 were measured by a modified Read rebreathing technique. The minute ventilation and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activities were calculated and plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure. Both the ventilatory and diaphragmatic muscle responses to CO2 decreased from NREM to REM sleep (P less than 0.05). Abdominal muscles were forcefully recruited in response to CO2 rebreathing during NREM sleep. In REM sleep, abdominal muscle response to CO2 was virtually absent or decreased compared with NREM sleep (P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) the abdominal muscles are recruited during NREM sleep in response to CO2 rebreathing in healthy premature infants near full term and 2) the abdominal muscle recruitment is inhibited during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep, and this REM sleep-related inhibition probably contributes to the decrease in the ventilatory response to CO2 rebreathing in REM sleep.\r"

In seven of the subjects, endogenous heating was produced by a 45-min exercise in a warm environment (41 degrees C; control 10 degrees C) with and without selective face fanning. Venous blood was collected before and after each trial; blood hormones were analyzed by radioimmunologic techniques. Heat loading, whether exogenous or endogenous in origin, induced significant increases in blood PRL, beta-endorphin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels. Blood thyrotropin (TSH) level decreased significantly during water immersion and more significantly with face cooling. From measurement in peripheral blood, the differential beta-endorphin, VIP, and TSH responses to selective face ventilation during exogenous and endogenous heat exposures suggest that blood PRL released in heat derives from secretory stimuli that are independent of these prolactinotropic factors.\r"

The subjects exercised first on a treadmill (brief exercise) and completed, on a separate day, a 20-km run. M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography, as well as calibrated carotid pulse tracings, were obtained at rest and immediately on completion of both brief and prolonged exercise. Left ventricular systolic function was assessed by end-systolic stress-shortening relationships. Heart rate increased similarly after brief and prolonged exercise (+30%). Mean arterial pressure decreased from 99 +/- 7 to 92 +/- 8 mmHg (P less than 0.001) after prolonged exercise, but it remained unchanged after brief exercise. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was decreased after prolonged exercise (130 +/- 23 vs. 147 +/- 18 ml at rest, P less than 0.01). Both ejection fraction and rate-adjusted mean velocity of fiber shortening decreased after prolonged exercise [from 67 +/- 5 to 60 +/- 6% (P less than 0.001) and from 1.12 +/- 0.2 to 0.91 +/- 0.2 cm/s (P less than 0.001), respectively] despite a lower circumferential end-systolic wall stress (133 +/- 23 vs. 152 +/- 20 g/cm2). The relationship between ejection fraction (or mean velocity of fiber shortening adjusted for heart rate) and end-systolic wall stress was displaced downward on race finish (P less than 0.05). These changes were independent of the changes in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and hence those in preload. The data suggest that moderately prolonged exercise may result in depressed left ventricular performance in healthy normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor. Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema. Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins. This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo. Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline. Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney. With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls. The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls. Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak. Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D. Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under baseline conditions maximum flow via the nose was lower than that via the mouth in the upper 50-60% of the VC on expiration and throughout the VC on inspiration. The mean ratio of maximum inspiratory to maximum expiratory flow at mid-VC was 1.38 during mouth breathing and 0.62 during nasal breathing. Inspiratory flow limitation with no increase in flow through the nose as driving pressure was increased above a critical value (usually between 12 and 30 cmH2O) was found in all six subjects studied. Stenting the alae nasi in seven subjects increased peak flow via the nose from a mean of 3.49 to 4.32 l/s on inspiration and from 4.83 to 5.61 l/s on expiration. Topical application of an alpha-adrenergic agonist in seven subjects increased mean peak nasal flow on inspiration from 3.25 to 3.89 l/s and on expiration from 5.03 to 7.09 l/s. Further increases in peak flow occurred with subsequent alan stenting. With the combination of stenting and topical mucosal vasoconstriction, nasal peak flow on expiration reached 81% and, on inspiration, 79% of corresponding peak flows via the mouth. The results demonstrate that narrowing of the alar vestibule and the state of the mucosal vasculature both influence maximum flow through the nose; under optimal conditions, nasal flow capacity is close to that via the mouth.\r"

PCA activity was recorded with intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes implanted through a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope. During quiet breathing in all subjects, the PCA was phasically active on inspiration and tonically active throughout the respiratory cycle. At comparable increments in respiratory output, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and voluntary hyperventilation appeared to be associated with similar increases in phasic or tonic PCA activity. During quiet breathing, the onset of phasic PCA activity usually occurred before inspiratory airflow and extended beyond the start of expiratory airflow. The duration of phasic PCA preactivation and postinspiratory phasic PCA activity remained unchanged during progressive hypercapnia and progressive hypoxia. The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors, suggest that vocal cord position throughout the respiratory cycle during hyperpnea is actively controlled by simultaneously acting and antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles.\r"

Each lung was perfused alternately with control and formaldehyde-fixed rabbit RBCs at a flow rate of 80 ml.kg-1.min-1, left atrial and airway pressures being 8 and 6 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Perfusate RBC concentration was kept constant at 3.2 x 10(6)/mm3 for group I lungs (n = 6) and 7.2 x 10(6)/mm3 for group II lungs (n = 6). In all lungs, we measured pressures in the pulmonary artery and in 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-null method during both perfusion periods. Compared with control, fixed cells had a 60% decrease in deformability index (i.e., the volume of a dilute solution of RBCs filtered through a 5-microns Nuclepore filter in 1 min). In groups I and II, perfusate viscosity of fixed cells was 15 and 55% greater, respectively, than that of control cells. We found that perfusion with fixed cells in group I lungs did not alter total or segmental vascular pressure drops. However, in group II lungs, perfusion with fixed cells at twice the cell concentration resulted in an increase in total vascular pressure drop, mainly due to an increase in pressure drop in veins (50% of total) and arteries (33%). The relatively small (17%) increase in pressure drop in microvessels was probably due to distension and/or recruitment of capillaries resulting from increased venular pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemorrhage of 450 ml at a mean rate of 71 +/- 5 ml/min decreased CVP from 6.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg and increased SNA by 47 +/- 11%. The increase in SNA during hemorrhage was not significantly different from the increase in SNA predicted by the slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP.

  ".W": "The mechanics of the pleural space has long been controversial. We summarize recent research pertaining to pleural mechanics within the following conceptual framework, which is still not universally accepted. Pleural pressure, the force acting to inflate the lung within the thorax, is generated by the opposing elastic recoils of the lung and chest wall and the forces generated by respiratory muscles. The spatial variation of pleural pressure is a result of complex force interactions among the lung and other structures that make up the thorax. Gravity contributes one of the forces that act on these structures, and regional lung expansion and pleural pressure distribution change with changes in body orientation. Forces are transmitted directly between the chest wall and the lung through a very thin but continuous pleural liquid space. The pressure in pleural liquid equals the pressure acting to expand the lung. Pleural liquid is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and viscous flow of pleural liquid is driven by the combined effect of the gravitational force acting on the liquid and the pressure distribution imposed by the surrounding structures. The dynamics of pleural liquid are considered an integral part of a continual microvascular filtration into the pleural space. Similar concepts apply to the pulmonary interstitium. Regional differences in lung volume expansion also result in regional differences in interstitial pressure within the lung parenchyma and thus affect regional lung fluid filtration.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the coordination of swallowing and breathing in 11 unconscious patients with an endotracheal tube in place during the recovery period from general anesthesia. Swallows occurred during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases with no preponderant occurrence during either phase. When a swallow occurred during inspiration, the inspiration was interrupted immediately and was followed by expiration, but the durations of both inspiration and expiration were progressively increased as the time from the onset of inspiration to the onset of swallowing was progressively delayed. A swallow coinciding with the expiratory phase progressively prolonged the duration of the expiration that had been interrupted as the timing of swallowing was progressively delayed. Repeated swallows invariably and in a predictable manner caused changes in the breathing pattern. Thus when the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively high, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, shallow, and rapid breaths. When the frequency of regularly repeated swallows was relatively low, the breathing pattern was characterized by regular, deep, and slow breaths. When the frequency of repeated swallows was irregular, the breathing patterns were characterized by inconsistent changes in tidal volume and respiratory frequency. Our results indicate that, in unconscious subjects, some mechanisms integrating respiration and swallowing are operative and responsible for changes in breathing patterns during swallowing.\r"

Most of those who gained weight sustained an increase in lean body mass (LBM), and most of those who lost weight lost LBM as well as fat. The change in LBM was directly related to the change in weight, with a regression slope of 0.500. An analysis of published data confirms these findings and, in concert with our data, provides the additional information that the magnitude of the change in body composition in exercising individuals is influenced by body fat content, just as it is for nonexercising individuals.\r"

  ".U": "91236636\r", 
  ".W": "The periodic variations of the pulmonary microvascular pressure during pulsatile perfusion were studied in isolated left lower lobes of canine lungs by the arterial occlusion (AO) and double occlusion (DO) techniques. Sixteen AO and eight DO maneuvers evenly distributed within the pump cycle were performed for each of four frequencies: 36, 54, 72, and 90 beats/min. Nearly identical microvascular pressure contours were reconstructed from the AO and DO maneuvers by relocating the measured occlusion pressures in time. These contours lagged behind the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform. Their amplitude decreased from 25 to 14% of the arterial pulse pressure as the pump frequency was increased from 36 to 90 beats/min. The modulus of the pressure transfer function at the site of arterial occlusion decreased as the frequency increased. The phase was negative for all frequencies and it approached -90 degrees for the higher frequencies. Vasoconstriction induced by serotonin resulted in an increase of the magnitude of the AO pressure contour that was nearly proportional to the increase of the pulmonary arterial pulse pressure. In contrast, elevation of the lobar venous pressure to 10 mmHg increased the amplitude of the AO pressure contour, whereas it slightly decreased the pulmonary arterial pulse pressure. These experiments demonstrate that the AO and DO pressures fluctuate markedly during pulsatile perfusion. Their oscillations would be indicative of the pulsatility in the pulmonary microvascular bed.\r"

The dismal prognosis for patients with oral malignant melanoma is partly due to patients' delayed recognition of signs of early disease and delayed diagnosis by physicians. Pigmented macules and plaques in the oral cavity, representing the radial growth phase of tumors, often go unrecognized for months or years before tumor invasion. Therefore, if early detection of thin oral melanomas is to be achieved, all pigmented oral cavity lesions should be viewed with suspicion. Biopsies of such lesions are indicated when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Prompt aggressive surgical treatment is essential in reducing the morbidity and mortality from oral melanomas. The differential diagnosis of oral melanomas includes nevi, oral melanotic macules, amalgam tattoos, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral melanoacanthoma, and physiologic pigmentation.\r"

Biopsy specimens revealed severe compact parakeratosis with the stratum corneum measuring 80 to 250 microns in maximal thickness, maintenance of the stratum granulosum, remarkable retention of keratohyaline granules throughout the stratum corneum, and vascular proliferation and ectasia. A contact reaction to an antiperspirant/deodorant is suspected as the cause. We speculate that the offending agent alters the maturation sequence of the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum, possibly by interfering with the degradation of filaggrin precursor to filaggrin units.\r"

The increasing number of nonhospital medical settings in which melanomas can be diagnosed and/or treated appears to account for this discrepancy. We suspect that these findings in Massachusetts also apply to cancer reporting systems in other regions of the United States. We suggest that the true incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts, and perhaps in the United States, may be significantly higher than reported.\r"

Before therapy, we observed an abnormal bandlike cellular infiltrate localized in the papillary dermis, composed mostly of CD3+ cells, with a prevalence of CD4+ cells. Infiltrating lymphocytes showed markers of activation (HLA-DR antigens and interleukin 2 receptor), and there were many Langerhans (CD1+) cells in the dermal infiltrate. After 15 days of cyclosporine therapy, we observed a dramatic decrease in the total number of T cells and a corresponding decrease in interleukin 2 receptor-positive activated CD25+ cells and in antigen-presenting cells (CD1+ and CD14b+). These changes were concurrent with clinical improvement. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD4 T cells by cyclosporine might explain the drug's therapeutic action and that the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and CD4 T cells is important in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.\r"

To evaluate further the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, the concentration of eosinophil cationic protein was measured in serum samples of 42 patients with moderate to severe disease. The results were compared with those obtained in 32 patients with psoriasis with (n = 9) or without (n = 23) a history of inhalant allergy, 12 patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid, 14 patients with a history of inhalant allergy, and 31 nonatopic healthy control subjects. Eosinophil cationic protein levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with atopic dermatitis (p less than or equal to 0.005) and patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid (p less than or equal to 0.01). There was no significant difference between eosinophil cationic protein levels in patients with psoriasis or a history of inhalant allergy and in control subjects. Moreover, eosinophil cationic protein levels did not differ significantly in psoriasis patients with or without inhalant allergy. These studies support the concept of an active participation of eosinophils in atopic dermatitis and point to a possible role for eosinophils in pseudoallergy.\r"

Histologic examination showed some features of an otherwise conventional dermatofibroma, whereas the polypoid component was hypercellular and showed striking atypia and scattered mitotic figures. After 32 and 28 months' follow-up, the lesions did not recur after surgical excision. We suggest the term atypical polypoid dermatofibroma to summarize the special clinicopathologic features of these tumors.\r"

Plaque-shaped or nodular erythematous lesions with ill-defined borders were seen. Clinical progression was slow; the skin tumors occurred for up to 7 to 15 years. Extracutaneous involvement was found in only one case. Immunohistologic investigations showed an expression of B cell markers with restriction to only one light chain type and absence of T cell antigens. The growth fraction was 5% to 30%, as shown with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The immunoarchitecture of the tumors in three patients was unusual compared with established criteria for cutaneous B cell lymphoma and revealed similarities to mucosa-associated B cell lymphoma. Some immunohistologic heterogeneity may indicate the development of monoclonal proliferation that originated from different phases of B lymphocytic differentiation. In three cases no clinical signs of B. burgdorferi infection were found; in one patient acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was present. The occurrence of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and malignant lymphomas was frequently reported in the European literature before B. burgdorferi was recognized. These findings suggest a relation between B. burgdorferi infection and cutaneous B cell lymphoma. In geographic regions where infected ticks are present, borreliosis should be considered in patients with cutaneous B cell lymphoma.\r"

Six months later a biopsy specimen showed a dense, diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate involving most of the dermis except for a thin Grenz zone. The appearance was consistent with lymphocytoma cutis. She had been bitten by a tick on the right ear in Switzerland 6 weeks before the onset of the lesion. Serologic tests by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Borrelia burgdorferi, done 6 and 11 months after the bite, yielded optical density readings of 1.04 and 0.65, respectively; indirect immunofluorescence yielded titers of 1:256 and 1:128. A Borrelia-like organism was identified by a modified Steiner stain; immunohistochemistry was noncontributory. The spirochetal origin of lymphadenosis benigna cutis is briefly reviewed.\r"

A biopsy specimen revealed caseating granulomas, but special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy failed to reveal an infectious organism. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphocytes within the granulomas were almost exclusively of the CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the circulating lymphocytes showed normal numbers of CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD8+ T cells, whereas B cells were undetectable. Other examples of noninfectious granulomatous disease have been reported in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, but this is the first case of caseating cutaneous granulomatous disease to be reported in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia.\r"

A biopsy specimen of the plaque revealed Pautrier's microabscess and a dense mononuclear cell infiltration with atypical convoluted nuclei in the papillary dermis. These cells were helper/inducer T lymphocytes that expressed the interleukin 2 receptor. The patient's white blood cell count was normal, but 1% atypical lymphocytes and a high titer of anti-human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibody were detected in his serum. A smoldering type of adult T-cell leukemia was diagnosed. While he was being treated with PUVA, a gait disturbance developed. A high titer of anti-HTLV-I antibody, characteristic of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, was demonstrated in his cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

The histologic findings, genetic transmission, and clinical course were similar to epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (Voerner type), but keratinocytes ultrastructurally displayed a tonotubular cytoskeleton, which has not been previously described, instead of a tonofilamentous one. Electrophoretically, we found no difference in the keratin pattern of normal plantar skin, skin in palmoplantar keratoderma of Voerner, and that of our patient's skin. Therefore the tubular keratin most likely formed as a result of a posttranslational change of keratin polymerization.\r"

Routine histologic and immunologic studies fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. Indirect immunofluorescence showed antinuclear antibodies without basement membrane zone fluorescence. We destroyed the nuclear antigens of the indirect immunofluorescence substrate with 2 mol/L sodium chloride, which unmasked basement membrane zone linear IgG staining. We also confirmed anti-basement membrane zone antibodies by employing a new technique of direct immunofluorescence on sodium chloride-split skin. Our finding prove that a thorough search for anti-basement membrane zone antibodies can be revealing. Our results support the idea that a subset of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus has the staining characteristics of epidermolysis acquisita, with the dermal side of the split skin showing linear immunoglobulin deposition.\r"
