  ".W": "We attempted to elicit quadriceps and hamstring electromyographic responses in seven chloralose-anesthetized cats by loading the ACL with controlled anterior displacement of the tibia on the femur using rigid fixation and an MTS testing machine. We did not detect reflex activity in the quadriceps or hamstring muscles of any of the cats in response to anterior tibial displacements of up to 4 mm, with rise times ranging from 1.0 to 0.1 seconds. In four of the cats we loaded the ACL using a wire loop. Loads of up to 125 N (4 to 5 times body weight) produced no reflex activity in any of the four animals, although we consistently observed monosynaptic reflex responses to tendon taps. Whole nerve recordings from the posterior articular nerve revealed substantial activity from afferents in response to tugging on the ACL, although we could not differentiate receptors in the ACL from those in other periarticular tissues. Thus, while traction on the intact ACL causes signals in the afferent nerves, those signals are not translated into direct monosynaptic reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "The planning of health education aimed at preventing sports injuries is often incomplete and not stated explicitly. In most instances, the evaluation is incomplete or nonexistent. We present a theoretical framework for planning and evaluating health education, illustrating the main points by using as an example the health education for downhill skiers. Systematic planning consists of analyzing the magnitude of the problem and the behavioral risk factors, studying behavior determinants, designing an optimal intervention, and implementing the intervention. The evaluation phase deals with the effects on these five levels (implementation, intervention, determinants, behavior, and incidence of injury). Some common pitfalls are mentioned and special attention is given to the study of determinants of behavior and to the design of the intervention. The importance of pretesting health education material and the community approach in educating sports participants is underlined. Health education, together with regulations and facilities, constitutes the health promotion strategy in the prevention of sports injuries. For most sports, there seems to be a strong need for further research on the etiology and determinants of behavior before effective prevention can be realized.\r"

  ".W": "From 1979 to 1986, isolated repair of a peripheral vascular zone meniscal tear was performed in 22 patients (23 menisci) who had ACL insufficiency. For various reasons none of these patients underwent repair or reconstruction of their ACL. The meniscus repair was done by open arthrotomy in 12 cases and by arthroscopic techniques in 11 cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success rate of a meniscal repair in an anterior cruciate deficient knee. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 25 years and the average followup was 56 months. Six patients (26%) had mild occasional pain not requiring medication and one patient had moderate pain requiring nonnarcotic pain medication. Eight patients (26%) had occasional giving way episodes and one of them underwent ACL reconstruction 5 years later because of frequent giving way. One patient required a postoperative manipulation for inadequate range of motion, but there were no neurovascular injuries or infections. There were three patients (13%) who had failed repairs or a retear and required subsequent subtotal meniscectomies. None of the other patients had any clinical symptoms or signs of a meniscal tear. There were no significant differences between the results of open or arthroscopic repair. Even though the failure rate of meniscus repair may be greater in an unstable knee, we conclude that meniscus repair is not contraindicated in an anterior cruciate deficient knee.\r"

Pain scores, the use of analgesic medications, crutch use, weight-bearing, activity level, and difficulty sleeping the night after surgery were all unaffected by the use of bupivacaine. The apparent lack of effect is most likely due to rapid clearance from the knee, leaving only a transient, 1 to 2 hours of potential benefit. In this study, the patients were already quite comfortable during this time period due to the routine use of intraoperative narcotics. The preoperative level of knee discomfort was found to be a major determinant of postoperative discomfort. Other much less important factors were synovial and chondral shaving, sex of the patient, and experience of the surgeon.\r"

The experimental group consisted of 237 randomly selected new recruits, while 1151 recruits were the control group. Insoles were given to the experimental group and compliance was monitored. A panel of doctors documented and classified all injuries occurring during the 9 week period. A total of 54 (22.8%) and 237 (31.9%) injuries were reported in the experimental and control groups, respectively. In both groups, the majority of injuries were overuse (experimental group, 90.7%; control group, 86.4%). The mean weekly incidence of total overuse injuries and tibial stress syndrome was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the experimental group. The mean incidence of stress fractures was lower in the experimental group but not significantly so (0.05 less than P less than 0.1). This study shows that the incidence of total overuse injuries and tibial stress syndrome during 9 weeks of basic military training can be reduced by wearing insoles.\r"

However, it is possible that some of the masses treated conservatively as scapulothoracic bursitis may be elastofibromas. A study is currently under way to evaluate the incidence of subscapular masses in college and professional pitchers in the United States.

In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique. We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury. Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed. Use of a lower concentration and a \"ceiling\" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered. If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended. If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned.\r"

  ".W": "Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical. Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI. We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience. Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events. The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status. However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1). We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure.\r"

  ".U": "91135960\r", 
  ".W": "The influence of desflurane on myocardial perfusion measured by a microsphere technique during a total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant moderate or severe stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was evaluated in chronically instrumented dogs. Hemodynamics, regional contractile function, and myocardial blood flow were measured during the conscious state and after anesthesia with desflurane (8.2%-9.2% and 12.5%-12.7%) with and without control of arterial pressure. Total left anterior descending occlusion produced in combination with a left circumflex coronary artery stenosis significantly (P less than 0.05) increased heart rate and left ventricular end diastolic pressure in the absence of desflurane anesthesia. Desflurane, administered only in the presence of left anterior descending occlusion and left circumflex stenosis, significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular positive dP/dt50 without change in heart rate. Blood flow to the subendocardium of normal myocardium was reduced during the high concentration of desflurane (P less than 0.05), but perfusion of the subepicardium and midmyocardium was maintained at conscious levels. When the left circumflex stenosis was of moderate severity, only blood flow to the subendocardium distal to the stenosis was reduced by desflurane (P less than 0.05). In the presence of a severe stenosis, perfusion was decreased in the subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium of the stenotic zone (P less than 0.05). During the reduction in arterial pressure produced by desflurane, collateral blood flow in the left anterior descending region was reduced in dogs with either a moderate or severe left circumflex stenosis (P less than 0.05). When arterial pressure and heart rate conditions observed in the postocclusion conscious state were restored during the high concentration of desflurane, myocardial blood flow in all regions returned to those levels present in the conscious state (P less than 0.05). Ratios of flow between occluded and normal zones were decreased when hypotension produced by desflurane was uncontrolled, but when arterial pressure and heart rate were adjusted to conscious postocclusion levels using partial thoracic aorta occlusion and atrial pacing, the ratio remained at conscious control levels regardless of the degree of left circumflex stenosis severity (P less than 0.05). Results of this investigation indicate that desflurane does not redistribute blood flow away from collateral-dependent myocardium to other regions via a \"coronary steal\" mechanism in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery disease.\r"

Effective amputation stump analgesia was obtained, significantly reducing the need for on-demand narcotic analgesics during this time to a mean dose equivalent of 1.4 mg of morphine compared with a retrospective control group who received the equivalent of a mean dose of 18.4 mg of morphine (P less than 0.0001).

Forty patients were divided at random into two groups with 20 patients in each group. Patients in group 1 received 0.5-1.0 mg intravenous midazolam and 25-50 micrograms intravenous fentanyl in increments administered by the anesthesiologist to achieve intraoperative sedation; patients in group 2 self-administered a mixture of midazolam (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (25 micrograms) in increments using an Abbott Lifecare PCA infuser to achieve sedation. Demographics of the patients, the types of surgery performed, doses of midazolam and fentanyl administered in a given period of time, and the level of sedation maintained during epidural anesthesia and surgery were similar in both groups. Patients in the self-administered group, however, rated their level of comfort during anesthesia and surgery higher than did those in the anesthesiologist-controlled sedation group. This could have been due to a positive psychological effect produced by allowing patient to feel that they have some control over their situation. The findings of this study indicate that patient-controlled sedation using a combination of midazolam and fentanyl is a safe and effective technique that provides intraoperative sedation ranked better by patients than that provided by anesthesiologists using the same drugs. More studies are, however, needed to determine the best choice of drug(s), the doses, the lock-out intervals, and the possible use of continuous infusion with patient-controlled sedation.\r"

The detection and correction times for these incidents were measured, as was compliance with Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines during cardiac arrest, and the occurrence of unplanned incidents. Experienced personnel tended to react more rapidly than did trainees, but differences between second-year anesthesia residents (CA2) and experienced anesthesiologists were not statistically significant. There was a high variability in performance between incidents and within each group. Unplanned errors and management flaws still occurred with experience subjects. The response to incidents during anesthesia is a complex process that involves multiple levels of cognitive activity and is vulnerable to error regardless of experience. Most trainees seemed to acquire adequate response routines by the end of the CA2 year. Formal reasoning appeared to play a minor role in responding to intraoperative events, but the exact nature of the anesthesiologist's cognition remains to be thoroughly investigated.\r"

However, the closeness of sevoflurane and isoflurane tissue/blood partition coefficients suggests that the rates of equilibration with and elimination from tissues should be similar. We tested both predictions, comparing sevoflurane with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in seven volunteers. We measured the rate at which the alveolar (end-tidal) (FA) concentration of nitrous oxide increased toward an inspired (FI) concentration of 65%-70%, then measured the concurrent rise in FA and mixed expired concentrations (FM) of sevoflurane and isoflurane at respective FI values of 1.0% sevoflurane and 0.6% isoflurane for 30 min. Minute ventilation (VE) was measured concurrently with the measurements of anesthetic concentrations. For the potent agents, we also measured VE, FA, and FM for 6-7 days of elimination. FA/FI values at 30 min of administration were as follows: nitrous oxide, 0.986 +/- 0.003 (mean +/- SD); sevoflurane, 0.850 +/- 0.018; and isoflurane, 0.733 +/- 0.027. FA/FA0 (FA0 = the last FA during administration) values after 5 min of elimination were as follows: sevoflurane, 0.157 +/- 0.020; isoflurane, 0.223 +/- 0.024. Recovery (volume of anesthetic recovered during elimination/volume taken up) of sevoflurane (101% +/- 7%) equaled recovery of isoflurane (101% +/- 6%). Time constants for a five-compartment mammillary model for sevoflurane were smaller than those for isoflurane for the lungs but were not different from isoflurane for the other compartments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Colorectal distention thresholds and tail-flick latencies were determined in timed pregnant rats (n = 27) before mating, on days 7 and 21 of gestation, and on postpartum day 7. Immediately after baseline testing on each of those days, animals received 0.1 mg/kg clonidine subcutaneously and were retested 30 min later. On day 21 of gestation, 20 micrograms/kg naloxone (n = 9) and 0.2 mg/kg yohimbine (n = 5) were intravenously administered after clonidine testing, and animals were retested 15 min later. In the absence of clonidine, pregnant animals demonstrated a statistically significant increase in their tolerance of colorectal distention pressures and longer latencies to tail-flick withdrawal on day 21 of gestation. Clonidine produced a further significant increase in distention thresholds on day 21 of gestation but did not change these thresholds on any other day, nor did it change tail-flick latencies. Naloxone and yohimbine reversed the effect of clonidine on the distention thresholds on day 21. Systemic clonidine, at a dose lower than that required to produce antinociception in nonpregnant rats, enhanced pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation late in pregnancy, an effect that was reversed by naloxone and yohimbine. These results suggest a synergistic antinociceptive effect of clonidine due to an interaction with an endogenous opiate system that is only activated late in pregnancy.\r"

Concentrations of hydromorphone in plasma from serial blood samples were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method specific for hydromorphone with a detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL. In all cases, plasma hydromorphone concentration versus time data for individual subjects were best described by a triexponential (instead of mono- or biexponential) function. Furthermore, we found that the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone was independent of dose across the range studied. Averaged across doses, the distribution and terminal elimination half-lives were 1.27 min (t1/2 pi), 14.7 min (t1/2 alpha), and 184 min (t1/2 beta), respectively. Average values for systemic clearance, initial dilution volume, and steady-state volume of distribution were 1.66 L/min (Cl), 24.4 L (Vc), and 295 L (Vdss). Our results indicate that hydromorphone pharmacokinetic parameters are linear across a fourfold range of doses that are usually employed clinically and that previously reported pharmacokinetic values for hydromorphone (based on radioimmunoassay measurements) deserve reconsideration.\r"

The incidence of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and pruritus, was also similar. Of the patients receiving fentanyl and low-dose bupivacaine, one developed a transient unilateral motor and sensory loss, and one developed significant hypotension and respiratory depression.

The anesthetic agents were thiopental, fentanyl, and isoflurane with or without nitrous oxide. Recordings were carried out before induction (preinduction) and during induction, surgical anesthesia, emergence, and recovery from anesthesia. The auditory response was evoked by 700-Hz tones that occurred occasionally and unpredictably in a train of 500-Hz tones delivered at 40 per second. The patients were asked to press a button whenever they detected a 700-Hz tone. Studies with normal subjects have repeatedly shown that detected tones (HITS) evoke N1 and P3 waves, whereas undetected tones (MISSES) evoke no recognizable waves. The responses evoked by HITS were compared with those evoked by MISSES. The amplitudes of N1 and P3 were significantly different from zero for HITS before induction and during induction and recovery but not during emergence. The amplitudes of N1 and P3 were not different from zero for MISSES during induction, surgery, and emergence. During recovery, the N1 and P3 for MISSES were small and the P3 for HITS was significantly larger than for MISSES. The results indicate that except during emergence, HITS were associated with clear N1 and P3 waves, whereas MISSES were not. The lack of either N1 or P3 for HITS during emergence perhaps occurred because the patients, although responsive, were not yet fully conscious. The N1 and P3 components of the auditory evoked potential may provide specific indicators for consciousness.\r"

  ".W": "The reason why adenine compounds when used as hypotensive agents are devoid of significant reflex sympathetic activity, such as rebound hypertension and tachycardia, is not clearly understood. This study, performed on alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, examined, first, the effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine as compared with those of sodium nitroprusside on efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), as an indicator of general reflex sympathetic activity, and second, whether vagal involvement could be demonstrated in the action of ATP and adenosine on RSNA. Renal sympathetic nerve activity increased progressively with increasing doses of sodium nitroprusside (5, 10, and 20 micrograms/kg) and adenosine (0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg), whereas ATP suppressed RSNA at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg. High doses of ATP and adenosine (4.0 mg/kg) were injected into intact (n = 7) and vagotomized dogs (n = 7). Both ATP and adenosine induced rapid onset of hypotension without rebound hypertension and tachycardia. After vagotomy, the attenuation of RSNA by ATP was completely abolished and rebound hypertension and tachycardia were observed. Vagotomy did not alter the effect of adenosine on RSNA. It is concluded that ATP-induced hypotension is associated with attenuation of sympathetic efferent nerve activity mediated through vagal afferent pathways. Vagal afferent impulses are thought to be one of the mechanisms that inhibit reflex sympathetic activities, such as rebound hypertension after ATP-induced hypotension. The mechanisms by which adenosine inhibits reflex sympathetic activity are not, however, secondary to vagal afferent involvement and must be multifactorial.\r"

Agents producing these effects may adversely affect the relationship between brain retractors and underlying cerebral tissues during craniotomy, potentially predisposing the patient to brain retractor injury. The effects of fentanyl, sufentanil, alfentanil, and a placebo (saline) on brain retractor pressure were therefore evaluated prospectively in 24 adults undergoing elective craniotomy. None of these narcotics significantly affected brain retractor pressure. Each significantly and similarly decreased arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. If these narcotics are administered in doses that avoid adverse hemodynamic changes that could compromise cerebral tissues indirectly, each of the narcotics studied appears safe for intraoperative administration once the cranium is open.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of succinylcholine on subsequent pharmacodynamics of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, a comparative pharmacodynamic study was carried out in patients having balanced anesthesia (thiopental, fentanyl, nitrous oxide/oxygen) in whom equipotent doses of pipecuronium (80 micrograms/kg) and pancuronium (100 micrograms/kg) were given with or without prior administration of succinylcholine (1 mg/kg). Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: 1, pancuronium (100 micrograms/kg); 2, pipecuronium (80 micrograms/kg); 3, succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) plus pancuronium (100 micrograms/kg); and 4, succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) plus pipecuronium (80 micrograms/kg). In groups 3 and 4, the nondepolarizing relaxant was given after succinylcholine when the twitch height recovered to 75% of its control value. For maintenance of neuromuscular blockade, additional increments of pancuronium (20 micrograms/kg) or pipecuronium (15 micrograms/kg) were given. Neuromuscular function was monitored throughout induction, maintenance, spontaneous recovery, and pharmacologic reversal of the neuromuscular block. Mean onset times for pancuronium (group 1) and pipecuronium (group 2) given without succinylcholine were (mean +/- SEM) 2.5 +/- 0.3 and 2.8 +/- 0.2 min, respectively. Mean onset times (times to maximum twitch depression) of the two drugs given after succinylcholine (groups 3 and 4) were significantly shorter (1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.1 min, respectively). Clinical durations (i.e., until 25% twitch recovery of pancuronium and pipecuronium) were not significantly different among the four groups, varying from 81.1 +/- 5.4 (group 4) to 107.0 +/- 17.0 (group 2) min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before epidural anesthesia, ranitidine (50 mg IM) or sodium citrate (30 mL orally) was administered to groups of 14 parturients each. Ranitidine was administered 2 h before epidural anesthesia and sodium citrate was administered 10 min before the epidural. Maternal plasma samples were collected after epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine. A total of 15 maternal plasma samples were taken from the time of administration of epidural anesthesia up to 180 min. Postpartum plasma and urine samples were also collected from both mothers and neonates. Plasma samples were collected up to 48 h postpartum at intervals of 12, 24, and 48 h. Urine samples were collected at six 6-h intervals up to 36 h postpartum. A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures demonstrated that there was no significant difference in bupivacaine levels between the maternal plasma curves of the ranitidine and the control groups. At the time of delivery, plasma levels of bupivacaine and its N-dealkylated metabolite PPX (2,6-pipecolylxylidine) were no different in the mothers or neonates of either group. There was no significant difference in plasma protein binding of bupivacaine in the presence of ranitidine. The excretion rates of bupivacaine and PPX were not measurably influenced by ranitidine. The amount of bupivacaine excreted, the amount of metabolite excreted, and the percentage of drug excreted as metabolite in maternal urine were not significantly different. These data indicate that there is no measurable effect of ranitidine on the disposition of bupivacaine in parturients.\r"

For comparison, we also determined the isoflurane MAC with 60% N2O in oxygen after an induction dose of 3 micrograms/kg IV fentanyl and similar doses of thiopental and succinylcholine. All patients were undergoing elective surgical procedures. The minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration in patients given isoflurane and 60% N2O with 3 micrograms/kg fentanyl was 0.4%, approximately 20% below previously reported MAC values for isoflurane with 60% N2O alone. The minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration of desflurane with 60% N2O plus 0, 3, 6, and 9 micrograms/kg IV fentanyl was 3.7%, 3.0%, 1.2%, and 0.1%, respectively. Thus, the MAC-lowering effect of 3 micrograms/kg IV fentanyl appears to be similar with both isoflurane and desflurane. Fentanyl, 3-9 micrograms/kg IV, produces dose-dependent decreases in the MAC of desflurane.\r"

Previously reported adverse reactions associated with annatto dye have included urticaria and angioedema. We present a patient who developed urticaria, angioedema, and severe hypotension within 20 minutes following ingestion of milk and Fiber One cereal, which contained annatto dye. Subsequent skin tests to milk, wheat, and corn were negative. The patient had a strong positive skin test to annatto dye, while controls had no response. The nondialyzable fraction of annatto dye on SDS-PAGE demonstrated two protein staining bands in the range of 50 kD. Immunoblotting demonstrated patient IgE-specific for one of these bands, while controls showed no binding. Annatto dye may contain contaminating or residual seed proteins to which our patient developed IgE hypersensitivity. Annatto dye is a potential rare cause of anaphylaxis.\r"

Many sinus-associated symptoms arise from nasal rather than sinus pathology; thus, it is important to detect the presence, extent, and nature of any disease within the sinus cavities. Conventional plain radiographs have limited sensitivity and have been supplanted by more widespread use of computerized tomography. The role of other modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging has not yet been completely determined. Other tests such as cytology and endoscopy can detect the presence of infection without the need for invasive antral puncture. Practitioners should consider the impact of a negative imaging test on their therapeutic plan and order tests on that basis.\r"

Furthermore, inhibitory effects of lidocaine on these responses elicited by substance P were also studied. In the intradermal test, children with moderate or severe bronchial asthma showed significantly stronger reactions than controls. In bronchial challenge with substance P, children with bronchial asthma showed an increasing fall in FEV1 and V50 in proportion to the severity of their asthma. Concomitant use of lidocaine significantly inhibited not only substance P-induced intradermal erythema and wheal reactions but air flow limitations. It also inhibited histamine-induced erythema and house dust-induced wheal and erythema reactions. No adverse reactions to lidocaine were observed. These results suggest that substance P might play an important role in cutaneous and bronchial hypersensitivity reactions in humans and that lidocaine has an inhibitory effect on substance P-induced reactions.\r"

Thirty-one patients with a history of fall seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated for 6 weeks with pemirolast, 50 mg bid, or placebo beginning approximately 2 weeks before the onset of the ragweed season in Atlanta. Daily evaluation of symptom scores disclosed statistically significantly less sneezing, rhinorrhea, and stuffy nose during treatment with pemirolast. There was, however, no difference for other evaluated symptoms or for the use of rescue medicines. There were no side effects during this short study. This preliminary study indicates that pemirolast may warrant further evaluation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\r"

We used a double-blind, randomized, parallel group design comparing 12 weeks of treatment with four regimens: fenoterol, 100 micrograms/dose; fenoterol, 200 micrograms/dose; fenoterol, 50 micrograms; and ipratropium, 20 micrograms/dose in a single inhaler (Berodual) and fenoterol, 100 micrograms and ipratropium, 40 micrograms/dose in a single inhaler (Duovent). During the baseline and active treatment period the patients recorded PEFR in the morning and evening, symptoms and use of a rescue inhaler. Changes in twice daily peak expiratory flow rates or asthma symptoms did not show any significant differences among the four treatment regimens during the 12 weeks compared with the baseline period. Use of the rescue inhaler did not differ among the four groups during the active treatment. The patients' assessment of the efficacy of the active treatment favored the low-dose fenoterol and low-dose combination. More side effects were recorded in the high-dose combination group during the first 4 weeks compared with the other groups. We conclude that in maintenance therapy of chronic asthma high doses of fenoterol alone or in combination with ipratropium bromide offer no clinical advantage over low doses. On the contrary, the low-dose fenoterol and the low-dose combination are better accepted and tolerated by the patients.\r"

Sixteen patients (77% of those with arthralgia) responded to diet (RD) with marked reduction of symptoms; the others did not respond (NR). Ten (all but one RD with arthralgia) had increased permeability to BLG after oral administration of cow milk. Four with high titers of IgG to BLG showed the highest absorption of BLG and the groups with arthralgia showed higher BLG levels than those without arthralgia. In all cases, specific IgE to cow milk was absent. These data suggest that the symptoms of a subgroup of patients with chronic urticaria, and especially patients with joint complaints that subside with diet, are related to excess intestinal permeability. The measurement of gut permeability to food proteins may be useful to define those who may benefit from dietary restriction.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective observational study of adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Data derived from annual interviews with patients from 1983 to 1988 and from physician surveys in 1983 and 1987. SETTING: Rheumatology practices in the community. PATIENTS: The study began in 1982 with 822 adults who had rheumatoid arthritis and were under the care of rheumatologists. INTERVENTIONS: Those selected by rheumatologists in the management of their patients. MEASUREMENTS: Information describing sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, course, and therapy was collected from patients and verified by physician reports. Functional status, measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the number of painful joints were used as outcome variables. Outcome variables were adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, baseline values of the outcome variable, and the use of four disease-remittive agents other than gold. MAIN RESULTS: Multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance showed no change in the course of rheumatoid arthritis over 5 years. The use of parenteral gold for at least 2 consecutive years at the start of the observation period produced, on average, no change in the course over 5 years in the two outcome variables. CONCLUSION: In our study of a community-based population of adults with rheumatoid arthritis who were under the care of community rheumatologists, we found that there was, on average, no statistically significant change in function or number of painful joints between 1983 and 1988. Patients receiving parenteral gold therapy for at least 2 consecutive years did not show a statistically significant difference in outcome when compared with those not receiving such therapy.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter trial in one university hospital and nine general hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients with active Crohn disease and a Van Hees Activity Index of 140 or more. Of 71 patients who were randomly assigned, 60 completed treatment and were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: For 16 weeks, 30 patients received sulphasalazine, 6 g/d (or 4 g/d if adverse effects occurred) and prednisone, 30 mg/d initially. Prednisone therapy was tapered in increments of 5 mg/2 wk to 10 mg/d after 8 weeks. Thirty other patients received sulphasalazine and a placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the first 6 weeks of treatment, the Van Hees Activity Index decreased to a median of 70% (interquartile range, 57% to 81%) of the initial value in patients treated with sulphasalazine and prednisone and to a median of 87% (interquartile range, 70% to 94%) in patients treated with sulphasalazine alone (P = 0.001). In the last 4 weeks of treatment, the corresponding figures were 63% (interquartile range, 40% to 75%) and 70% (interquartile range, 54% to 90%) (P = 0.10). The Crohn's Disease Activity Index decreased in the first 6 weeks to a median of 65% (interquartile range, 57% to 86%) in patients receiving sulphasalazine and prednisone and to a median of 75% (interquartile range, 58% to 101%) in patients receiving sulphasalazine alone (P = 0.13). In the last 4 weeks of treatment, the corresponding figures were 65% (interquartile range, 42% to 90%) and 76% (interquartile range, 49% to 110%) (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The use of prednisone in addition to sulphasalazine in patients with active Crohn disease results in a significantly faster initial improvement, but not in a significantly better result after 16 weeks of treatment, when disease activity is measured by the Van Hees Activity Index.\r"

SUBJECTS: Five staff physicians, three general internal medicine fellows, and 34 internal medicine residents in the hospital-based practice and 178 of their patients. Seventy-six physicians in the office-based practices and 230 of their patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians underestimated or failed to recognize 66% of disabilities reported by patients. Patient-reported disabilities were underestimated or unrecognized more often in the hospital-based practice than in the office-based practices (75% compared with 60%, P less than 0.05). Physicians overstated functional impairment in 21% of paired responses in which patients reported no disability. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often underestimate or fail to recognize functional disabilities that are reported by their patients. They overstate functional impairment to a lesser degree. Because these discrepancies may adversely affect patient care and well-being, medical educators and clinicians should pay more attention to the assessment of patient function.\r"

SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Of 1030 patients with AIDS who were followed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1 January 1980 and 30 September 1989, 20 (2%) developed pneumothorax that was unrelated to trauma or a pulmonary procedure. RESULTS: Of 20 patients with AIDS who presented with pneumothorax, 19 had compelling evidence of concurrent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Using bivariate analysis, patients receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis (relative risk, 17.6) and those with a history of P. carinii pneumonia (relative risk, 14.5) were more likely to develop pneumothorax. By Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis, aerosol pentamidine use was a statistically significant risk factor independent of a history of P. carinii pneumonia. The pneumothorax-related mortality rate was 10% and there was considerable morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIDS at the highest risk for developing pneumothorax are those with a history of P. carinii pneumonia who are receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis but who nevertheless develop P. carinii pneumonia. The benefits of aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis in these patients far outweigh this risk. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be considered as the most likely diagnosis in any patient with AIDS who develops a pneumothorax.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endothelin-1, a potent endothelial-derived vasoconstrictor peptide, in pulmonary hypertension, by measuring its concentration in arterial and venous plasma. DESIGN: A survey, case series study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven patients with pulmonary hypertension: 7 with primary, and 20 with secondary pulmonary hypertension of various causes. The control groups (n = 16) comprised 8 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with coronary artery disease but without evidence of pulmonary hypertension. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly increased (94/43 +/- 23/13 mm Hg) in the patients with pulmonary hypertension. Venous plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, measured by a specific radioimmunoassay, was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (3.5 +/- 2.5 pg/mL, P less than 0.001) than in normal subjects (1.45 +/- 0.45 pg/mL), or patients with coronary disease (0.75 +/- 0.64 pg/mL). The arterial-to-venous ratio of immunoreactive endothelin-1 was significantly greater than unity in primary pulmonary hypertension (2.21 +/- 0.72, P = 0.01), whereas the patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension had a mean ratio not different from 1 (0.97 +/- 0.42). In contrast, the mean arterial-to-venous ratios were significantly less than unity in both control groups (0.59 +/- 0.35, and 0.54 +/- 0.64; P less than 0.02, for normal subjects and coronary disease patients, respectively), indicating a possible clearance of endothelin-1 across the healthy lung. CONCLUSIONS: Patient with pulmonary hypertension have substantial alterations in plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, which may reflect changes in net release or clearance of endothelin-1 by the lung. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the high levels in arterial compared with venous plasma suggest pulmonary production of endothelin-1, which may contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.\r"

Because of the varied clinical manifestations of this illness and the use of unstandardized serologic testing methods, diagnosis is often uncertain and treatment outcomes are often difficult to evaluate. The antibiotic regimens that are commonly used in clinical practice have changed rapidly. They show much regional variation with little critical comparison of treatment results. The clinical diagnosis and the literature on the treatment of the various stages of Lyme disease are reviewed. The reported data are supplemented with recommendations based on 15 years of clinical experience with this illness.\r"

  ".W": "Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is most commonly transmitted to humans by a tick bite. Characterized by early and late phases, Lyme disease is a multisystem illness involving the skin, heart, joints, and nervous system. Diagnosis is based predominantly on clinical manifestations, the most specific being dermatologic. Thus, recognizing the dermatologic manifestations of Lyme disease is important for diagnosis and institution of appropriate, effective therapy. Approximately 75% of patients with Lyme disease present with the pathognomonic skin lesion erythema migrans, an expanding erythematous lesion. During early infection, secondary erythema migrans lesions or Borrelia lymphocytoma may occur. Borrelia lymphocytoma commonly presents as an erythematous nodule on the ear lobe or nipple. During late infection, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, an erythematous, atrophic plaque unique to Lyme disease may appear; it has been described in about 10% of patients with Lyme disease in Europe. Fibrotic nodules associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans as well as other sclerotic and atrophic lesions, such as morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, anetoderma, and atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini, have been seen late in the course of Lyme disease. In a few cases, other sclerodermatous lesions, such as eosinophilic fasciitis and progressive facial hemiatrophy, have been linked to B. burgdorferi infection. We review the cutaneous lesions associated with Lyme disease.\r"

In all brains, the planum temporale was again symmetrical. Also, in two of the brains, multiple foci of cerebrocortical glial scarring were present. In both women, many of the scars were myelinated, suggesting origination during late intrauterine or early postnatal life. In one, scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex. In the other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically. All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, and focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases. Two women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astrocytoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas. Reexamination of previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated glial scars. Two control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated glial scars as well. The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed, and possible etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on the nervous system.\r"

CSF immune complexes were found in 22 (69%) of 32 patients; in 18, there was sufficient sample to isolate immune complexes. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, isolated immune complexes from 10 of these 18 patients contained antibody specific for B. burgdorferi antigens. The isotypes were IgG (n = 8), IgM (n = 3), and IgA (n = 2). By immunoblot, these antibodies were directed against B. burgdorferi 41-kDa antigen and occasionally against the 33- and 17-kDa antigens. Anti-B. burgdorferi IgM was present in patients with acute neurological symptoms, was predominantly complexed rather than free, and decreased with clinical recovery in the one serial study. Three patients were nonreactive for free CSF antibodies, but had complexed antibodies to the organism. The preliminary finding of specific B. burgdorferi components in immune complexes in CSF suggests an active process triggered by the organism, even in the absence of other CSF abnormalities.\r"

In this study, localized 1H spectroscopy was used to observe directly the stimulation of brain metabolic activity in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to compare results obtained before and after treatments. Persistent increases in lactate were expected on the basis of animal data but these increases were small and equivocal 1 hour after ECT. In contrast, a large increase in a lipid signal from before to after ECT was observed in 5 patients when short echo times were used. We postulate that a significant portion of this lipid signal is related to maximal activation of the phosphatidylinositol system (increased levels of diacylglycerol and free fatty acids) have generalized inhibitory effects potentially relevant to both the clinical pathophysiology of seizures and the efficacy of ECT in major affective disorders.\r"

The diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia was established by the history and physical findings and by excluding other diseases through laboratory investigations. PET studies revealed a statistically significant widespread increase of local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in the brains of patients with Friedreich's ataxia who were still ambulatory, in comparison with normal control subjects. Nonambulatory patients with Friedreich's ataxia, in comparison with normal control subjects, had significantly increased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the caudate and lenticular nuclei, but not in the other structures studied. The rate was significantly greater in ambulatory patients with Friedreich's ataxia than in nonambulatory patients in all structures studied except the caudate and lenticular nuclei. The data suggest that early in the course of Friedreich's ataxia, the local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose is increased extensively in the central nervous system, and as the disease progresses, it decreases in a regionally specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "The glucose transporter of the human brain has been localized to endothelial cells expressing the blood-brain barrier, but little is known regarding its mechanism of induction or whether its expression is exclusively linked with restricted vascular permeability. We investigated glucose transporter expression by vessels in human astrocytic tumors and pulmonary metastases to the brain using immunohistochemical techniques. Vessels in 9 of 10 low-grade astrocytomas and 8 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas were positive for glucose transporter. Glioblastoma vessels were transporter-positive in only 2 of 10 specimens. Vessels in all three metastatic tumors were negative for the glucose transporter. The decrease in transporter expression observed in higher-grade tumors occurred independently of increases in vascular permeability. In low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas transporter expression and contrast enhancement were inversely related, but vessels in 6 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas were transporter-positive despite contrast enhancement. These findings suggest that separate mechanisms induce the glucose transporter and the permeability restrictions of the human blood-brain barrier. They also have potential implications for the therapy and prognosis of astroglial neoplasms.\r"

One hundred and eighty-three clinically diagnosed patients were identified between 1980 and 1985 through the Geriatric and Family Services clinic at the University of Washington hospital, and 18 patients were identified during the same time period through the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. Telephone interviews were conducted with spouses (87.7%) and children (12.3%) of the patients. Each patient was matched to a friend or nonblood relative of the patient by age, sex, and the relationship between the patient and his or her respondent, for a total of 130 matched pairs. The odds ratio for AD was elevated if a first-degree relative was reported to have a history of dementia (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 4.18). This risk was especially elevated if a sibling was affected (odds ratio, 4.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 11.90); the highest risk to the proband was observed if a sibling had presumed AD (odds ratio, 5.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.59 to 21.96). The risk increased with increasing numbers of first-degree family members affected for both a history of dementia and presumed AD. We found little difference between patients and control subjects with respect to the age of the mother or father at the time of the subject's birth. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to conditions that might support the immune and viral hypothesis in AD, smoking, or alcohol problems.\r"

Nine of the 14 patients (Group A) had clinical signs of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, and the remaining 5 (Group B) did not have signs of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration. PET studies of Group A revealed significantly decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the superior cerebellar vermis in comparison with the normal control subjects. Group B did not show decreased rates in the cerebellum. Both Groups A and B showed decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose bilaterally in the medial frontal area of the cerebral cortex in comparison with the normal control subjects. The severity of the clinical neurological impairment was significantly correlated with the degree of hypometabolism in both the superior cerebellar vermis and the medial frontal region of the cerebral cortex. The degree of atrophy detected in computed tomography scans was significantly correlated with local cerebral metabolic rates in the medial frontal area of the cerebral cortex, but not in the cerebellum. The data indicate that hypometabolism in the superior cerebellar vermis closely follows clinical symptomatology in patients with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, and does not occur in alcohol-dependent patients without clinical evidence of cerebellar dysfunction. Hypometabolism in the medial frontal region of the cerebral cortex is a prominent finding in alcohol-dependent patients with or without alcoholic cerebellar degeneration.\r"

Conventional electromyographic (EMG) studies can demonstrate the selective involvement of the sensory pathways but they do not provide definite evidence for the site of the lesion. Noting that the trigeminal sensory neurons carrying cutaneous and muscular afferents are differentially located in the gasserian and mesencephalic nuclei, respectively, we carried out an electrophysiological study of the trigeminofacial and trigeminotrigeminal reflexes in 5 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy, in 10 patients with sensory-motor neuropathies of other causes, and in 10 healthy subjects. Our results show that patients with Sjogren's syndrome and pure sensory neuropathy who exhibited abnormal blink reflexes and an abnormal, cutaneous-induced masseter silent period had normal jaw jerks, whereas patients with sensory-motor neuropathies who exhibited abnormal cutaneous responses had abnormal jaw jerks. These findings suggest that the lesion in pure sensory neuropathy involves damage to the neurons of the gasserian ganglia and not to the trigeminal axons, since an axonal lesion would be expected to involve the large axons from muscle spindle receptors.\r"

In the present study, the number of repeatedly studied patients (n = 63) was large enough to determine statistically significant sequences of events and statistically significant spatial relations. The first observable event was a decrease of regional cerebral blood flow posteriorly in one cerebral hemisphere. Further development of this pathological process was accompanied by the aura symptoms. Thereafter headache occurred while regional cerebral blood flow remained decreased. During the headache phase, regional cerebral blood flow gradually changed from abnormally low to abnormally high without apparent change in headache. In some patients headache disappeared while regional cerebral blood flow remained increased. Although regional cerebral blood flow reduction and aura symptoms in the great majority of patients were unilateral, one-third had bilateral headache. Unilateral headache usually localized to the side on which regional cerebral blood flow was reduced and from which the aura symptoms originated (i.e., aura symptoms were perceived to occur contralaterally but presumably originated in the hypoperfused hemisphere). Our results suggest a simple model for migraine attacks: A pathological disturbance in one cerebral hemisphere causes the aura symptoms and after a time delay, it also causes the headache by stimulating local vascular nociceptors. Bilateral headache caused by a unilateral cerebral disturbance may be explained by recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological findings.\r"

  ".W": "It is believed that the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) localizes an electrical source in the brain to within several millimeters and is therefore more accurate than electroencephalogram (EEG) localization, reported as 20 mm. To test this belief, the localization accuracy of the MEG and EEG were directly compared. The signal source was a dipole at a known location in the brain; this was made by passing a weak current pulse simulating a neural signal through depth electrodes already implanted in patients for seizure monitoring. First, MEGs and EEGs from this dipole were measured at 16 places on the head. Then, computations were performed on the MEG and EEG data separately to determine the apparent MEG and EEG source locations. Finally, these were compared with the actual source location to determine the MEG and EEG localization errors. Measurements were made of four dipoles in each of three patients. After MEGs with weak signals were discounted, the MEG average error of localization was found to be 8 mm, which was worse than expected. The average EEG error was 10 mm, which was better than expected. These results suggest that the MEG offers no significant advantage over the EEG in localizing a focal source. However, this does not diminish other uses of the MEG.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the records of 160 consecutive patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma to evaluate the long-term consequences of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We defined long-term survivors as those patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma who lived at least 100% longer than median survival of historical controls, for example, 2 years for patients with glioblastoma and 4 years for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. There were 9 (5.6%) long-term survivors. Three (30%) became demented and died without evidence of tumor recurrence. One, after survival of 10 years, died of tumor recurrence. Of the remaining survivors, 2 (22%) have significantly impaired short-term memory function and other neurological deficits such as gait apraxia. Three (30%) can function independently. It is likely but cannot be proved that it is radiotherapy and not chemotherapy that is the causal factor of this dismal therapeutic outcome. Our study suggests restraint in the use of radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors that have more favorable prognoses than glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, such as low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.\r"

At the time of disease recurrence, a variety of different single agents and drug combinations result in tumor shrinkage and increased survival. The addition of chemotherapy to standard radiotherapy improves the rate and length of disease-free survival for those children with MB/PNET who have the most extensive tumors at diagnosis. It remains to be determined which drug or drug combinations are the most effective in MB/PNET, and which patients are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be useful to reduce or, in selected cases, obviate the need for radiotherapy and reduce treatment-related sequelae.\r"

Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases.

The increased susceptibility of such animals to M. avium infection is comparable to that of C57BL/6 beige mice and thus may provide a viable alternative to the latter model. Further, using representative strains of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated M. avium (serotypes 1, 4, and 8 and a rough isolate), we show that the course of such infections in thymectomized, CD4-deficient mice can be markedly restrained and in some cases the infections can be sterilized by treatment over a 120-day period with a regimen containing 40 mg of the new antimycobacterial agent rifabutin per kg (body weight).\r"

Compared with placebo, low-dose rimantadine was highly effective in the prevention of influenza A virus infection (20 of 110 versus 7 of 112 participants; P less than 0.01) and influenza illness (7 of 110 versus 1 of 112 participants; P = 0.04).

Its efficacy and tolerability as empiric therapy and its pharmacokinetic properties in neutropenic patients are being studied in a double-blinded, randomized trial in comparison with those of vancomycin. We report here a modified agar diffusion bioassay which is suitable for monitoring levels of either teicoplanin or vancomycin in serum during combination therapy with beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and amphotericin B. Serum samples spiked with either teicoplanin or vancomycin gave reproducible results (mean coefficient of variation, 8.8%) regardless of the presence of tobramycin, amikacin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, amphotericin B, or their combinations. Among 25 patients who received teicoplanin at a dosing schedule of 6 mg/kg every 24 h intravenously, steady state was reached after 14.2 +/- 4.0 days, and 1-h peak and trough concentrations of teicoplanin in serum at steady state were 40.8 +/- 15.0 and 12.5 +/- 3.2 mg/liter, respectively. In contrast, among 25 patients who received vancomycin at a dosing schedule of 15 mg/kg every 12 h intravenously, steady state was reached by 24 h, and the 1-h peak and trough concentrations in serum were 37.5 +/- 15.6 and 8.3 +/- 3.8 mg/liter, respectively. The elimination half-lives for teicoplanin estimated by two separate approaches agreed closely with each other: 80.5 +/- 21.5 h by an accumulation model (M. Gilbaldi and D.

Eradication of colonization or the carrier state could limit the spread of MRSA, thus reducing the potential for mortality and morbidity in other patients. The detection of patients with MRSA infection in a rehabilitation ward led to a study of the combination of novobiocin-rifampin in vivo and in vitro. We found that 300 mg of rifampin plus 500 mg of novobiocin orally twice daily for 5 days, in 18 courses of treatment given to 12 patients, resulted in the clearing of MRSA in 79% of the evaluable courses and 81% of the evaluable sites. A second course cleared MRSA from one of the patients with a treatment failure. Side effects were not noted. All 18 pretherapy isolates were susceptible to either drug in vitro, but 1 of 2 posttherapy isolates was rifampin resistant. Timed-kill studies demonstrated that the rate of killing was the same with either drug alone or both drugs together. Pretherapy isolates from treatment successes or failure were killed at the same rate by the drug combination. However, with the rifampin-resistant isolate killing ceased after 48 h. Results of this study suggest that previously untreated patients are likely to have isolates that are susceptible to the combination of drugs and that the combination is commonly effective in eradicating MRSA carriage. Since the regimen is orally administered, and thus convenient, in conjunction with other measures it has the promise of reducing the spread of MRSA in hospitals.\r"

Lovastatin dramatically decreased the steryl ester content from 2.62 to 0.8 micrograms/mg (dry weight), whereas the free sterol content decreased only from 2.79 to 2.24 micrograms/mg (dry weight) when lovastatin was present in the medium at 10 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations (100 micrograms/ml), lovastatin nearly abolished the accumulation of steryl esters and decreased the free sterol concentration to less than 1.3 micrograms/mg (dry weight). As a result of the lowered sterol levels, proportional amounts of exogenous sterol were taken up from the medium during aerobic, respiratory conditions. Nearly all of the exogenous sterol taken up was partitioned into the free sterol fraction. The inhibition of sterol esterification in the presence of lovastatin was dependent on heme synthesis. The result of these combined effects caused the MICs of three azole antifungal drugs (ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole) to be lowered from 6- to 32-fold when lovastatin was present in the medium at 10 micrograms/ml.\r"

The presence of the two amidoxime peaks in chromatograms was confirmed by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry and by unequivocal synthesis of the suspected metabolites. The metabolic reactions were found to be catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 system (mixed-function oxidases). The formation of the monohydroxylated product was found to have a Km of 0.48 mM and a Vmax of 29.50 pmol/min per mg of protein, while the dihydroxylated metabolite had a Km of 0.73 mM and a Vmax of 4.10 pmol/min per mg of protein. N,N'-Dihydroxypentamidine was found to have highly reduced antiprotozoal activity in vitro relative to that of pentamidine, and neither of the hydroxylated metabolites nor pentamidine was found to be significantly mutagenic by the Ames test. Contrary to previous reports, pentamidine is readily metabolized to at least two hydroxylated products, and this conversion may be relevant to the clinical use of the compound and to future drug design.\r"

Peptide mapping of this PBP from the four species yielded identical results that were analogous to those obtained with S. aureus SR 1550-9. These results suggest that this protein is similar to, if not the same as, PBP 2' of S. aureus and that it is involved in methicillin resistance in the four species studied.\r"

The presence of this region reduced the overall expression of methicillin resistance and the synthesis of the mec-encoded penicillin-binding protein 2' (PBP 2') in S. carnosus. This region was located by Bal31 deletion mutagenesis upstream of the structural gene for PBP 2'. Deletions within this region resulted in higher levels of expression of methicillin resistance and increased levels of PBP 2' synthesis. We tentatively called this region mecR. Analysis of selected Mcr strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis by Southern hybridization suggested that the natural occurrence of two types of mec resistance determinants differ by the presence or absence of mecR-specific sequences.\r"

The transformation of either epimastigotes into metacyclic trypomastigotes or amastigotes into trypomastigotes was inhibited by the drugs in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of epimastigote differentiation was also dependent on the time of drug addition to the medium. Proliferation of T. cruzi was also blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the drugs, with the exception of novobiocin, which did not inhibit epimastigote replication and resulted in cell lysis when it was used at high concentrations. On the other hand, the transformation of amastigotes into epimastigotes in axenic culture was not inhibited; this process did not require either kinetoplast (mitochondrial) DNA replication or changes in the DNA network organization. Electron microscopy of cells treated with Tarivid (ofloxacin) showed damage to the kinetoplast, suggesting that this organelle might be the target of the drug. These results indicate that a bacterial-like topoisomerase II plays an important role in T. cruzi proliferation and differentiation.\r"

The outer membrane protein profile analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a deficiency of one of the major protein species which may serve as a porin for entry of chloramphenicol. When the strain was transformed with a plasmid encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, chloramphenicol added to the culture was not inactivated, suggesting a drastic reduction of permeability towards the drug. Moreover, transformants bearing a plasmid coding for the Escherichia coli OmpF porin became considerably more susceptible to chloramphenicol (40 micrograms/ml). On the other hand, transformants carrying a plasmid encoding the Salmonella typhi ompC gene remained as resistant to the drug as the parental strain, even though they overexpressed OmpC. These findings indicate that the lack of OmpF plays a major role in the resistance to chloramphenicol in strain 1895.\r"

Isolates tested were both S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci that had been recovered from a variety of geographic and clinical sources.

The structural gene encodes a polypeptide product of 286 amino acids, and the estimated molecular weight of the mature protein is 28,900. Amino acid sequence comparison of the SHV-2pBP60-1 enzyme with all known class A beta-lactamases and homology studies showed that the residues were highly conserved. Furthermore, SHV-2pBP60-1 was clearly related to SHV-1, LEN-1, and OHIO-1. The SHV-2pBP60-1 enzyme differed from SHV-1 isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae by seven amino acid substitutions. One of these substitutions, the Gly----Ser substitution at position 234, is probably a key region for the novel activity of cefotaxime hydrolysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by using all class A beta-lactamases of known sequences by a progressive alignment method. The data suggested that the beta-lactamases of gram-positive Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus species appeared early in evolution, followed by the PSE and CARB enzymes of Pseudomonas species and, more recently, by the SHV-type and TEM-type enzymes found in enteric bacteria. Larger evolutionary distances separated clusters of the gram-positive beta-lactamases than separated clusters of the gram-negative enzymes. Results of this phylogenetic study suggested that extended-spectrum enzymes are recent derivatives that are selected by the use of new cephalosporins.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory and postantibacterial activities of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against virulent Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were evaluated in cell-free and cellular models. In the absence of macrophages (with the tissue culture medium alone), bacterial numbers remained unchanged at 24 h in the presence of 0.1 microgram of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin per ml and 1.0 microgram of pefloxacin per ml, whereas they were reduced in the presence of 1.0 microgram of ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin per ml. Experiments to evaluate the postantibacterial effects of these drugs were therefore performed with concentrations of 0.1 microgram/ml. In the cell-free model, brief exposure (1 h) of bacteria to each antimicrobial agent resulted in a transient decrease in numbers followed by logarithmic growth. In the cellular model, all three drugs (at 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml) inhibited the intracellular multiplication of L. pneumophila. The intracellular postantibacterial effects of 0.1 microgram of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin per ml, which were left in contact with L. pneumophila-infected human macrophages for 24 h, were evaluated at various times after removal of the drugs. Pefloxacin was found to exhibit a significant inhibitory effect at 72 h, whereas following the removal of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, rapid bacterial multiplication occurred, leading to the destruction of the macrophage monolayer within 48 h. Thus, while pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin all inhibited the multiplication of L. pneumophila in human monocyte-derived macrophages, only pefloxacin exhibited a prolonged postantibacterial effect.\r"

Systemic clearance of theophylline was significantly decreased by approximately 40, 46, and 50% after oral coadministration of 25, 100, and 200 mg of enoxacin per kg, respectively. No significant changes in the volume of distribution of theophylline were observed. 4-Oxoenoxacin had no direct effect on theophylline disposition. Significant changes in urinary excretion of theophylline and its metabolites were observed. (i) Urinary excretion of unchanged theophylline was significantly increased in proportion to increases in enoxacin dosage. (ii) Decreases in renal clearance of theophylline and metabolic clearance of 1-methyluric acid and 1,3-dimethyluric acid were observed. (iii) The percent decreases in the metabolic clearance of 1-methyluric acid were dependent on enoxacin dosage. It is likely that enoxacin inhibits the elimination process, which depends on cytochrome P-450-mediated isozymes for N demethylation and oxidation, and that the capacity of the inhibitory effect of enoxacin is greater in the N-demethylation pathway than it is in oxidation.\r"

Each subject received, in an open-labeled, randomized, three-way crossover design, a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (two tablets) of cefetamet pivoxil 10 min after a standard breakfast during each of the following treatments: treatment A, control period; treatment B, antacid (80 ml of suspension; Maalox 70) administered on the evening before cefetamet pivoxil dosing (-12.5 h) and again 2 h before and 2 h after a standard breakfast; treatment C, ranitidine (150 mg) administered twice a day for 4 days and again 1 h and 10 min prior to cefetamet pivoxil dosing. Plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24-h period following cefetamet pivoxil administration. Cefetamet was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Oral bioavailability parameters (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h, area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma, and maximum concentration of drug in plasma) were obtained by noncompartmental techniques. The results showed that none of these bioavailability parameters was significantly (P greater than 0.05) affected by antacid or rantidine coadministration. A compartmental analysis showed no significant differences. In addition, the terminal elimination half-life and the fraction of cefetamet excreted unchanged in the urine was also not significantly (P greater than 0.05) affected by antacid or ranitidine exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subcutaneous injection of 1.6 x 10(6) U of human recombinant IFN-alpha 2b per kg delivered peak concentrations in plasma of 3,600 U/ml at 2 h postadministration with a half-life of elimination of 2.9 h. This dosage of IFN-alpha could be delivered to cats for up to 12 weeks without significant clinical toxicity. Oral administration of AZT (20 mg/kg three times daily) resulted in peak concentrations in plasma of 3 micrograms/ml at 2 h with a half-life of elimination of approximately 1.60 h. Treatment of FeLV-FAIDS-infected cats with IFN-alpha, either alone or in combination with orally administered AZT, resulted in significant decreases in circulating p27 core antigen beginning 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. AZT alone had no effect on circulating virus antigen. Depending upon whether high (1.6 x 10(6) U/kg)- or low (1.6 x 10(4) to 1.6 x 10(5) U/kg)-dosage IFN-alpha was used, cats became refractory to therapy 3 or 7 weeks after the beginning of treatment. At these times, IFN-alpha-treated animals developed antibodies to IFN-alpha that were neutralizing, specific for human recombinant IFN-alpha, and dose dependent in magnitude. The results of this study indicate that human recombinant IFN-alpha is effective in reducing circulating virus antigenic load in cats persistently infected with FeLV-FAIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cortisone acetate treatment, which produced impaired cell-mediated immune function, was followed by nasal inoculation of 5 x 10(4) CFU of N. asteroides into each mouse. Therapy was begun 24 h after inoculation and continued for the next 96 h. Dosages of antimicrobial agents resulted in concentrations approximating levels in human serum. Animals from each of nine treatment groups were sacrificed every 24 h. The pulmonary tissue obtained was homogenized and quantitatively cultured. Results were calculated to indicate the number of CFU per gram of lung tissue. Amikacin and imipenem were the two most effective single agents studied. Sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin were ineffective, and ceftriaxone reduced bacterial counts modestly. Combination therapy did not enhance the bactericidal activities of the agents tested. We conclude that amikacin and imipenem, as well as select broad-spectrum cephalosporins, represent therapy superior to the sulfonamides in this experimental model and may represent alternative treatment for patients who cannot tolerate sulfa agents (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients) or who fail primary treatment.\r"

Resistance to methicillin and gentamicin was present in over 50% of the strains, although resistance to the other agents was present in less than 10%. It is shown how application of mathematical modeling techniques can add to the understanding of such MIC data. MICs of methicillin and gentamicin were highly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary pressures for development of resistance to these agents were similar. The structural relationships among the glycopeptides were accurately reflected in their spatial relationships within the model. MICs of ramoplanin were negatively correlated with MICs of some other antimicrobial agents, particularly gentamicin, suggesting that this agent is more active against gentamicin-resistant strains. Methicillin-resistant strains were more tightly clustered than were methicillin-susceptible strains, suggesting that methicillin-resistant strains were more closely related to each other than were methicillin-susceptible strains. Mathematical modeling techniques enable more detailed analysis of MIC data.\r"

We subjected a highly resistant MRSA strain to transposon mutagenesis with the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn551, and a mutant expressing greatly decreased methicillin resistance (RUSA4) was selected to characterize the transposon insertion site. The results indicate that the Tn551 insertion site in mutant RUSA4 is between base pairs 1000 and 1400 of the sequence encoding PBP 2A. Thus, the uniform and greater than 200-fold drop in the methicillin MIC (4 micrograms/ml) for this mutant relative to that for the parent strain (MIC greater than or equal to 800 micrograms/ml) must be related to the inactivation of the PBP 2A gene. The results provide the first unequivocal evidence for the importance of PBP 2A as a quantitative contributor to the MIC for MRSA.\r"

Their reactions to Baby Check were positive: in 79 (92%) it gave an accurate assessment of the baby's illness and 16 (100%) said they would trust it. Fifteen (94%) found it useful, and most of those who did not said the baby was not ill or had an obvious diagnosis. Thirteen (81%) said they would use it and wanted their health visitors and midwives to use it and 15 (94%) wanted the mothers in their practice to use it. The majority (64%) of babies scored 0-7; 31% scored 8 to 19; and only 5% scored over 20. Well babies had low scores, while the two sickest babies, needing urgent hospital treatment, scored 29 and 33. The use of Baby Check by GPs would help them assess babies thoroughly and quantify illness severity objectively.\r"

The duty registrar and two consultants independently graded the severity of each baby's illness without knowledge of the Baby Check score. The registrars assessed the babies at presentation while the consultants reviewed the notes. The consultants and registrars agreed about the need for hospital admission only about 75% of the time. The score's sensitivity and predictive values were similar to those of the registrars' grading. The score's specificity was 87%. Babies with serious diagnosis scored high, while minor illnesses scored low. The predictive value for requiring hospital admission increased with the score, rising to 100% for scores of 20 or more. The appropriate use of Baby Check should improve the detection of serious illness. It could also reduce the number of babies admitted with minor illness, without putting them at increased risk.\r"

In an attempt to improve the diagnostic accuracy in infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when standard methods produced equivocal results, we have been using prototype paediatric duodenoscopes (PJF 7.5 and XPJF 8.0; Olympus) to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). From 159 infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, 11 were referred for ERCP, which was performed in nine. In four in whom bile ducts were definitely visualised laparotomy was avoided. Operative cholangiography confirmed patent bile ducts in one in whom visualisation had been uncertain. Three of four in whom bile ducts were not seen had extrahepatic biliary atresia. Visible bile drainage in the fourth excluded atresia. No major complications ensued but there was radiological evidence of gall bladder perforation in one (common hepatic duct block) and overinflation with air was a problem until finer cannulae (Wilson-Cook) were introduced. In appropriately selected patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ERCP with paediatric duodenoscopes in experienced hands may provide useful diagnostic information.\r"

The patients had an average of 2.1 episodes of respiratory tract symptoms the total mean (SD) duration of which was 30 (2) days of the 92 days that followed. Wheezing occurred during 76 (66%) of the 115 episodes and during a third of these the patient was admitted to hospital because of severe dyspnoea. Wheezing started a mean (SD) of 43 (7) hours after the first symptoms of respiratory infection and persisted for 3.8 (4.2) days in patients in whom virus infection was diagnosed. The incidence of wheezing was not associated with IgE mediated atopy, with positive virological tests, or with fever during virus infection, but was associated with parental smoking and more than one sibling.\r"

Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding.\r"

Concentrations of high density lipoprotein were measured at 5 and 11 years. Cholesterol values increased rapidly from birth and plateaued at 1 year. There was a further small rise just before puberty. Tracking of values was seen after the age of 1 year, but did not become established until 4 years of age. The cholesterol concentrations in girls were marginally higher than those in boys. The mean (SD) values of cholesterol (mmol/l) for boys were: at birth, 1.7 (0.4); at 1 year, 3.9 (0.9); at 5 years, 5.2 (1.9); and at 11 years, 5.0 (0.7). For girls the corresponding figures were; at birth, 1.9 (0.6); at 1 year, 4.7 (1.0); at 5 years, 4.6 (0.7); and at 11 years, 5.1 (0.7). The mean (SD) high density lipoprotein concentrations (mmol/l) for boys were: at 5, 1.16 (0.35) and at 11, 1.51 (0.23). For girls they were 1.28 (0.30) and 1.56 (0.27), respectively. The serum cholesterol concentrations in these children were high compared with published figures from north America.\r"

In one severe case, treatment with prednisolone was associated with an alteration to negative calcium and magnesium balance, and faecal losses of calcium were particularly high. This effect persisted for at least three months after the steroids had been discontinued, and during this period there was pronounced retardation of linear growth. Six months after the treatment had been stopped mineral balance was again positive and there was rapid 'catch up' in growth. In infancy, the negative effect of corticosteroids on calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium metabolism may contribute to inhibition of bone growth and steroid stunting.\r"

Ten of the children (27%) either failed to respond to the regimen or relapsed within 12 months. Improvement in the eczema was seen in 27/37 (73%) patients, by discharge from hospital their disease severity score had fallen to a median of 27% of the pretreatment figure, and only 3/27 required topical corticosteroids. There were no clinical or laboratory findings which could be used to predict the outcome. Drawbacks to the regimen were prolonged hospitalisation (median 70 days), a fall in body weight and serum albumin concentration, and a risk of anaphylactic shock (4/37 cases). A strict antigen avoidance regimen may be associated with improvement of atopic eczema where conventional treatments have failed.\r"

In an open trial, monoclonal antibody 16H5 was infused at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg of body weight on 7 consecutive days. Studies of the kinetics demonstrated a drastic depletion of CD4+ cells, to as low as 25 cells/microliters, 1 hour after the first infusion. The subsequent recovery of the CD4+ cell numbers 24 hours after infusion did not reach initial levels, and after the full 7-day treatment cycle there was a significant reduction of the number of CD4+ cells (mean +/- SD 51 +/- 28%; P less than 0.02). There was a reduced or even inverse CD4:CD8 ratio, which generally persisted 3-4 weeks. Lymphocyte transformation assays demonstrated significantly reduced reactivity in 5 of the 9 patients who completed the 7-day course, whereas 4 individuals exhibited an unexpected elevation in the T cell response to mitogens and common antigens. Parallel laboratory studies showed a significant decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P less than 0.05), rheumatoid factor titer (P less than 0.04), and total immunoglobulin values (P less than 0.01), as well as a reduction in C-reactive protein levels, in 7 of the 9 patients.

Adverse effects were urticaria in 2 patients, which led to withdrawal of therapy in 1 of them, and chills with fever, suggestive of a lymphokine release syndrome, in another 2 patients. Only low levels of human anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies developed (not exceeding 1.7 mg/liter). It was therefore possible to repeat the treatment cycle, achieving still better efficacy, in 4 of the patients (reductions in the Ritchie index and the number of swollen joints P less than 0.02). Our findings indicate that treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the CD4 antigen leads to immunomodulation which results in clinical benefits, at least during initial observation periods (up to 6 months postinfusion). However, it remains to be determined whether long-term remission can be induced with this therapeutic approach. The use of immunosuppressive therapies or repeated antibody treatments will have to be considered.\r"

SF samples were analyzed for the presence of crystals and for cell counts, using undiluted SF directly in a Niebauer cell counting chamber. Thirty-seven of the aspirated knees had previously been inflamed, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were seen in SF aspirates from 36 of them (97%). Of the 37 knees that had never been inflamed, only 8 contained MSU crystals (P less than 0.00001). After reaching the joint, MSU crystals will persist in the SF as long as the serum uric acid level has not been lowered by appropriate treatment. In this situation, analysis of SF is an excellent diagnostic test for the intercritical gout. The mean cell count in the 44 SF samples that contained MSU crystals was 449/mm3 (95% confidence interval 310-589); the mean cell count in the 30 SF without MSU crystals was 64/mm3 (95% confidence interval 34-95) (P less than 0.00002). The SF samples that contained MSU crystals also had a higher percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes than those without MSU crystals (P less than 0.002). These data suggest that there is a low-grade inflammation present in the knees of patients with MSU crystals, the consequences of which should be investigated.\r"

Eight patients in the MTX group experienced a total of 8 complications (8.7% of procedures). In comparison, 5 patients in the non-MTX group experienced a total of 6 complications (5.5% of procedures), a difference that was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 0.816, P = 0.366). Statistical analysis of many other variables revealed none that could be identified as risk factors for postoperative complications. These results suggest that treatment in the perioperative period with weekly low-dose pulse MTX does not increase the risk of local postoperative infectious complications or poor wound healing in rheumatoid arthritis patients who undergo total joint arthroplasty.\r"

Patients were classified into 5 groups according to therapeutic regimen and disease: RA treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), RA treated with NSAIDs and prednisone, RA treated with NSAIDs and methotrexate (MTX), OA treated with analgesics, and OA treated with NSAIDs. There were no significant between-group differences in the percentages or the distribution pattern of the infiltrating T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), HLA-DR, or interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells. However, inflammatory indices, which included the thickness of the lining cell layer and the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate, were significantly higher in the RA patients treated with prednisone and those treated with MTX (P less than 0.05). Similarly, fibrosis was markedly reduced in these 2 groups. The RA patients treated with NSAIDs alone and the 2 groups of patients with OA demonstrated similar profiles. These data suggest that prednisone and MTX may inhibit the development of fibrosis without altering the subsets of the inflammatory cell population. This observation raises the possibility that the action of these 2 drugs may be partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for fibroblast activation.\r"

  ".W": "Using our animal model of synovial mast cell-mediated arthritis in rats, we tested the effects of 3 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aspirin, indomethacin, and ketoprofen) and an H1 and an H2 histamine receptor antagonist (diphenhydramine and cimetidine, respectively) on synovial and dermal mast cell-induced vasopermeability. Drug effects were assessed by quantifying the leakage of radiolabeled albumin into tissues following specific antigen-initiated activation of passively sensitized dermal and synovial mast cells. The 3 NSAIDs tested had different effects on synovial and dermal mast cell-induced vasopermeability. Aspirin and indomethacin significantly increased dermal and synovial plasma exudation (P less than or equal to 0.008). Ketoprofen decreased dermal (P = 0.015), but had no effect on synovial, vascular exudation. Complete histamine H1 and H2 receptor blockade with diphenhydramine and cimetidine, respectively, substantially decreased (P less than or equal to 0.0008), but did not completely inhibit, dermal and synovial mast cell-induced vasopermeability. However, the addition of indomethacin to the combined antihistamine regimen resulted in an increase in the leakage of the radiolabel into skin and synovium (back to control levels), despite the complete blockade of H1 and H2 receptors. Results of experiments with antihistamines and indomethacin suggest that mediators other than histamine are involved in synovial mast cell-induced inflammation. Furthermore, the differential response to ketoprofen indicates that the specific antigen-stimulated mediator release profiles of dermal and synovial mast cells are different. Our finding of enhanced synovial vascular leakage in animals treated with some NSAIDs, and no such effect by other NSAIDs, perhaps explains in part the diverse effects of these agents in humans with arthritis.\r"

Deposits of autoantibodies were observed on proliferating collagen fibers, nuclei of chondrocytes, and epidermal cells. Increases in the frequency of positivity for rheumatoid factor and anti-type II collagen antibodies and in the level of serum oxidation activity were noted in these mice. The joint disease in male NZB/KN mice was transferable to female NZB/KN mice and male BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of spleen cells from the male NZB/KN mice. This animal model of arthritis will be extremely useful for analyzing not only the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, but also new strategies for its treatment, since NZB/KN mice, unlike MRL/lpr mice, do not develop severe lupus nephritis or lymph-adenopathy, and therefore have a longer survival period.\r"

  ".W": "We recently described a method for inducing immunologic tolerance to trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB), a hapten that generates suppressor cells capable of down-regulating the efferent phase of TNP-specific contact hypersensitivity in rats. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of such tolerized rats, upon being triggered by specific hapten, suppressed contact hypersensitivity to another hapten elicited at the same time. This implied that cells that mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity of any specificity might be down-regulated, provided that the suppressor cells are activated with specific antigen and that the unrelated delayed-type hypersensitivity is elicited in parallel. To rigorously test this possibility, we examined the ability of TNP-specific suppressor lymphoid cell factors to affect cells that mediate adoptively transferable adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. To induce arthritis, spleen cells from Freund's complete adjuvant-injected rats were stimulated with concanavalin A and administered to naive recipients. Prior to adoptive transfer, the cells were exposed for brief intervals to supernatants of lymphoid cells from control and hapten-tolerized rats. Supernatants of PEC and lymph node cells from hapten-tolerized rats were found to markedly reduce the effectiveness of cells that mediate AIA. The hapten-tolerized cells required reexposure to hapten prior to preparation of the supernatants. Supernatants of spleen cells from hapten-tolerized rats that had been hapten-painted as well as hapten-triggered and supernatants of lymph node cells and of PEC from only hapten-painted or hapten-triggered rats were ineffective in altering the AIA. Thus, factors from suppressor cells induced toward hapten-coupled self-antigens have been found to adversely affect the function of lymphoid cells that mediate a totally unrelated inflammatory response, namely, AIA. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Mean levels of C1q were higher in patients with a disease duration less than or equal to 5 years (173 micrograms/ml) than in patients with a disease duration greater than 5 years (148 micrograms/ml) (P = 0.032). Serum C1q levels were correlated with total joint counts and activities of daily living scores, but no correlation was observed with erythrocyte sedimentation rates or with radiographic scores. The results suggest that C1q may be a useful early marker of disease activity in patients with RA.\r"

We evaluated 4 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) currently on the market and the new antiinflammatory/antirheumatic drug tenidap for their effects on the release of activated collagenase. In contrast to the 4 NSAIDs, tenidap profoundly inhibited the release of activated collagenase. This inhibition was predominantly due to interference with activation of the latent enzyme, rather than interference with enzyme release. The inhibition of collagenase activation was associated with a profound reduction in myeloperoxidase activity and in hypochlorous acid production. These observations demonstrate that tenidap has properties that set it apart from conventional NSAIDs and suggest that it may be a particularly useful agent in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic disorders.\r"

An earlier warning that use of both arteries would devascularize the sternum was based on postmortem radiologic imaging. This was complemented by a subsequent animal study employing isotopic microspheres. In the present clinical study, laser Doppler flowmetry was adapted to identify changes in blood supply to the left half of the divided manubrium sternum during separation of the left internal mammary artery from its chest wall attachment. Our finding of continued blood flow after this event suggests that complete devascularization of the sternum does not take place. Quality of sternal bone and surrounding tissues and clinical indications should remain as factors influencing use of one or both internal mammary arteries.\r"

This observation has led to numerous news reports and to the publication of conclusions of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation. The data for these reports come from investigations of EMS helicopter accidents and incidents. The authors surveyed all listed civilian EMS helicopter programs to examine both helicopter ambulance mishaps and the number of safely completed missions. Epidemiological methods were then used to compare the safety records of different groups of EMS helicopters. The single most important factor identified was the number of flights made by the program during the study period: busy programs had an eightfold lower accident rate (P less than .0005) and a three-fold lower total mishap (accidents + incidents) rate (P less than .0005) than less active programs. Programs with the ability to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR) at the pilots discretion had no mishaps (P = .044) during the study period. Multivariate analysis shows this IFR capability to be marginally significant as an independent factor (P = .099).\r"

  ".W": "Oral nifedipine (N) and clonidine (C) are often used in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies; however, until recently, there were no comparative studies using the same patient population. The authors reviewed the records of hypertensive patients treated in the emergency department between October 1, 1987 and September 30, 1988. Selected patients had a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than 115 mm Hg without evidence of acute end organ damage. Patients were stratified into three treatment groups: N, C, and group 3 (G3). G3 received a variety of drug therapies but not exclusively N or C. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), percent decrease in MAP (%MAP), time to lower blood pressure, admissions, and discharges were evaluated. Efficacy and safety were defined as reaching a DBP less than 110 mm Hg but %MAP of no greater than either 25% or 40%, respectively. Thirty-five N, 32 C, and 27 G3 patients were identified with no statistical difference between groups in race, gender, pretreatment SBP, DBP, or MAP. N, C, and G3 significantly reduced SBP, DBP, and MAP (P less than .01). Comparing N, C, and G3, no differences were observed in %MAP, admissions, discharges, efficacy, or safety. Time required to decrease blood pressure differed between all three groups (44 +/- 32 N v 77 +/- 57 C v 152 +/- 94 min G3) (p less than .05). These results indicate that N, C, and a variety of drug therapies are equally effective and safe in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies.\r"

Concern arose when monitoring of adverse reactions showed an excess of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias, including rearrest, in the lidoflazine group. To ascertain the cause of this problem and determine whether it was ethical for the trial to continue, an in-depth review of data was conducted, outside experts were consulted, and additional data were collected. These efforts suggested possible causes for the problem. Existing drug administration protocols for blood pressure control were reinforced, resulting in lower subsequent arrhythmia rates. Thus, through an efficient monitoring system, an important problem was uncovered and resolved, allowing the trial to be completed without major changes.\r"

Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy.\r"

Sixty-five percent stated potential exposure to HIV/AIDS was a major occupational stressor. Ninety-two percent stated they would treat HIV/AIDS patients if protected. Given a choice, 38% would avoid providing treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. Eighteen percent considered resigning from emergency medical services (EMS) work. An attitudinal scale (AIDSTRESS) was developed to evaluate overall treatment and career reactions. Respondents with significantly higher (more negative reactions) AIDSTRESS scores were: BLS providers, men, paid providers, personnel with more than 3 years of field experience, those working in urban areas, personnel with no formal education beyond high school, and those who stated that their HIV/AIDS training was inadequate. Implications of the findings for quality of care, career decision making, and inservice education are discussed.\r"

To identify factors that delay patient flow through the ED, the authors conducted a prospective study of all chest pain patients, using a time-flow analysis. Eighty-eight (36%) of 245 patients required critical unit admissions and had an average department stay of 3 1/2 hours. Flow differences were seen between critical and noncritical care patients. Three primary sources of delay were identified: critical unit bed availability, the registration process, and the role of the unit admitting resident. Additional findings confirmed the efficacy and role of the triage nurse in patient flow. Nursing and medical education and staffing needs were addressed. The use of the community's emergency medical services was examined by analyzing the disposition of patients arriving at the ED by ambulance.\r"

These injuries were classified as osseous (fracture/dislocation) (n = 21), disc herniation (n = 29), and spinal cord injury (edema/contusion/transection) (n = 21). Diagnostic imaging results in 33 of the 49 patients undergoing both MRI and CT were compared. CT demonstrated 22 fracture/dislocations compared to 10 on MRI. MRI demonstrated 19 disc protrusions compared to 7 on CT. Additionally, MR imaged 13 cord injuries as compared to 0 by CT. MR imaging proved superior in demonstrating spinal cord pathology and intervertebral disc herniation. CT was superior to MRI in demonstrating osseous injury. CT and MRI may be useful together in determining presence and extent of spinal column injury.\r"

The authors measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) in six patients with septic encephalopathy associated with multiple organ failure (three to five organs). They found that CBF and CMRO2 were significantly lower than awake control values of 46 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 mL/100g/min (mean +/- SEM) and 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.2 mL/100g/min, respectively. Cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) and cerebral circulatory index (CCI:CBF/CMRO2) were significantly higher than the control values of 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/mL/100g/min and 15.1 +/- 0.8 to 24.2 +/- 3.3, respectively. At the time of cerebral circulatory and metabolic measurements, their consciousness varied between 4 and 10 as evaluated by the Glasgow coma scale. The electroencephalogram showed diffuse slow wave activity and the latency of the auditory brain stem evoked response was prolonged in four of six patients. Computed brain tomography showed either no abnormality or mild atrophy. It is concluded that CBF and CMRO2 are disproportionally decreased during septic encephalopathy in association with dysfunction of the CNS and decreased electrical activity.\r"

The potential risk to the patient from not receiving an adequate amount of AC, especially when AC may be the sole means of gastric decontamination, is obvious. To simulate this potential problem, samples of five different aqueous AC products (ActaChar, Actidose, InstaChar, LiquiChar, and SuperChar) were placed into storage for periods of 3 and 12 months. At the end of each study period, samples were agitated and the effluent and container residue were collected, oven-dried, and weighed. With the exception of Actidose, all products retained substantial amounts of AC in the container at both time intervals. These data stress the negative impact of dormant storage on the resuspendability of aqueous activated charcoal products. Furthermore, they suggest the importance of thorough container agitation and rinsing to insure that the patient receives sufficient AC. This is especially important when AC is the sole means of decontamination.\r"

In a double-blind, prospective study, 62 healthy adult volunteers received a 0.5 mL subcutaneous infiltration of 0.5% buffered bupivicaine into the dorsum of a randomly chosen hand. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by adding 0.05 mL of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/L [corrected]) to 10 mL vials of commercially available bupivicaine (1:200 dilution). The control hand was injected with the same amount of unbuffered agent. Pain was scored after each infiltration using a nonsegmented visual analogue scale. Student's t-test for paired measurements was used to analyze intergroup pain score differences. Forty-three subjects (69%) reported less pain with buffered bupivicaine and only 17 (27%) noted a modest increase: two subjects (3%) reported no difference. The mean pain score for the buffered agent was 22 mm compared with 30 mm for the control. The mean difference (control-experimental) was 8 mm (t = 4.64, df = 61, P less than .001). The authors conclude that the addition of sodium bicarbonate to bupivicaine reduces the pain associated with its local infiltration.\r"

Analysis of deaths due to ATVs have been limited to a few states. Death certificates for ATVs were abstracted for the years 1983 through 1989 in Wisconsin. Fifty-two deaths were analyzed; 44 (85%) were male, and 26 (50%) were under age 18. Head injuries accounted for 33 (63%) of the deaths. Thirty-one of the deaths (60%) were \"immediate\", occurring in \"seconds\", \"minutes\", or \"immediately\". Following the model developed by Haddon, there are several promising injury-control strategies: limiting the use of ATVs to those sixteen or older, increasing visibility of vehicles through means such as flags, increasing helmet usage, and improving emergency medical systems services. Many of these strategies are best promoted through statewide legislative policy changes. This injury study model of ATV deaths suggest that a more balanced approach towards injury reduction should have an equal emphasis on improving injury prevention and acute care.\r"

However, the emergency medicine literature places little emphasis on the particular risks in children younger than 2 years old with blunt head injury. These children have immature bone and unfused sutures that may increase risk of cranial injury and delayed complications. A case is presented to illustrate this point. Unlike severe head trauma, where evaluation is directed toward computed tomography, the literature continues to be controversial regarding the indications for skull radiographs and computed tomography in minor head trauma. The authors recommend a low threshold for radiographic imaging in blunt heat injuries in children younger than 2 years.\r"

For statistical purposes, mass spectrometry was the reference point for the presence or absence of a specific substance. All instrument sensitivities, with the exception of mass spectrometry, were set with the same \"cut off\" point of 100 micrograms/L for marijuana and 300 micrograms/L for cocaine and its metabolites. Efficiency in the detection of cocaine and its metabolites was 95% by all methods. Efficiency for the detection of marijuana and its metabolites ranged from 70% (Roche's OnTrak) to 90% (Syva's ETS).

These cases illustrate the need for vigilance in detecting and addressing pneumothorax prior to hyperbaric decompression in obtunded patients. Serial physical examinations, arterial blood gas determinations, properly positioned chest radiographs, and a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax in the setting of emergent hyperbaric therapy are recommended.\r"

The use of these techniques for patients with traumatic high level quadriplegia, however, is hampered by the resort to tracheostomy in the acute hospital setting. Twenty traumatic high level quadriplegic patients on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via tracheostomy with little or no ability for unassisted breathing were converted to noninvasive ventilatory support methods and had their tracheostomy sites closed. Four additional patients were ventilated by noninvasive methods without tracheostomy. These methods included the use of body ventilators and the noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure alternatives of IPPV via the mouth, nose, or custom acrylic strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI). Overnight end-tidal pCO2 studies and monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were used to adjust ventilator volumes and to document effective ventilation during sleep. No significant complications have resulted from the use of these methods over a period of 45 patient-years. Elimination of the tracheostomy permitted significant free time by glossopharyngeal breathing for four patients, two of whom had no measurable vital capacity. We conclude that noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives can be effective and deserve further study in this patient population.\r"

This type of myoelectric control is contrasted with digital myoelectric control, in which the system is fully on or off, giving the amputee no control over speed of hand opening and closing, and the grip force is increased only by increasing the time of the sustained EMG signal. A survey was conducted of 33 patients wearing the proportional myoelectric hand. Patients rated quickness of opening and closing; control over speed and force; effort required to open and close; and comfort, convenience, and cosmesis of the hand; as well as giving it an overall rating in comparison with their previous terminal device. The ratings were made on a 5-level scale, so that they could be quantified. Patient responses were grouped according to previous experience with a terminal device type: group A: digital myoelectric hand; group B: body-powered terminal device; group C: no terminal device. Differences in group means were compared using Student's t test. Previous digital hand wearers gave significantly higher ratings to the proportionally controlled hand overall, especially for its quickness, control of speed and force, and the effort required to open and close the hand. Former body-powered terminal device wearers rated the proportionally controlled hand significantly better on control over speed and force and on cosmesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eucalyptamint was applied to the anterior forearm skin of one side, and placebo was applied to the contralateral forearm. The subjective feelings, cutaneous blood flow, and skin temperature were measured before and periodically (5-min intervals) after the application of the compound. Muscle temperature was measured before and 30 min after the application of the Eucalyptamint. There was no significant effect on the subjective sensation. However, there were statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increases in cutaneous blood flow (up to 4 times base-line) and skin temperatures (up to 0.8 degrees C higher than base-line) after the application of Eucalyptamint with the effects lasting up to 45 min after the application. The muscle temperature was also increased (0.4 degrees C) significantly (P less than 0.05) 30 min after application of the Eucalyptamint. There were no significant changes in the placebo application.

There were significant (P less than 0.01) differences in the amplitudes, latencies, and modified H:M ratios of the responses recorded from the different muscles. The SOL modified H:M ratios were consistently the highest (x = 1.02), while the H:M ratios for MG (x = 0.34) and LG (x = 0.37) were consistently the lowest. Latencies of H-reflexes obtained from proximal recording sites (x = 29.2 ms) were significantly shorter than those from the most distal site (x = 31.5 ms). These results establish the contribution made by various deep and superficial muscles to the conventionally recorded H-reflex and help explain the differences in H-reflex amplitudes and latencies when recordings are made from different sites.\r"

The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation. Reliability is basic to any scientific measure. Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure. Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained. Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized. Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not. An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated. Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database. Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales. Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed. Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce. Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources. Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures.\r"

The time from admission to achievement of independent function and the time from onset of stroke to achievement of independent function was modeled in relation to explanatory variables: age, sex, side of lesion, comorbidity, the presence of depression and the extent of impairment in perception, cognition, auditory comprehension and verbal expression. Four variables were found to influence recovery time: age influenced the rate of recovery of walking and stair climbing; perceptual impairment influenced the rate of achieving independent sitting and stair climbing; and depression and comprehension influenced walking.\r"

Mechanisms by which larger iridotomies fail to prevent angle closure glaucoma, and the role of provocation tests following iridotomy, are discussed. An iridotomy should be at least 150-200 microns in diameter if acute angle closure glaucoma is to be reliably prevented.\r"

The children were examined at regular intervals between 3 months and 4 years of age, and the results are discussed in terms of changes in refraction between different ages and correlations between refraction and development of strabismus and amblyopia. Six of 34 children (17.6%) developed constant or intermittent esotropia. The strabismus was first noted between 18 and 30 months of age except in one case. All esotropic children were 4 dioptres hypermetropic or more at 6 months, and their hypermetropia remained almost unchanged through the years. Seven additional children were 4 dioptres or more hypermetropic at 6 months but did not develop a squint. In contrast to the squinting children the hypermetropia in these children changed towards emmetropia. This emmetropisation was most pronounced during the first 2 years of age. The implications of these results for an early diagnosis of strabismus amblyopia are discussed.\r"

In patients with both a macroaneurysm and venous occlusion there was a 12.0 times higher prevalence of macroaneurysms in the area of retina drained by the occluded vein (p less than 0.05). Common findings associated with macroaneurysms included retinal haemorrhage (81% of patients), retinal exudate (70%), vitreous haemorrhage (30%), macular involvement (30%), and distal arteriolar narrowing (26%).

  ".W": "A series of 24 patients with Fuchs's dystrophy are presented in whom detailed clinical measurement showed an association with axial hypermetropia and shallow anterior chamber. In 14 of these patients one cornea had developed oedema, of which 11 had required penetrating keratoplasty. Comparison of these eyes with the fellow eyes without corneal oedema revealed that the anomalies in measurement were not due to the process of decompensation. These 14 patients were then compared with the remaining 10 patients without corneal oedema in either eye, and a similar profile of anomalous measurements was observed. The whole group of 24 patients were then compared with three separate control groups, and in each case a significant trend towards hypermetropia, short axial length, and shallow anterior chamber was noted. The mean spherical equivalent refractive error in the patients with Fuchs's dystrophy was +2.48 D compared with -0.31 D for controls; corresponding means for axial length were 22.1 mm compared with 23.4 mm; and for anterior chamber depth were 2.2 mm compared with 2.7 mm. Each of these differences was statistically significant, but there was no significant difference for the keratometry measurements between patients and controls. Five of 24 (21%) of the patients had problems related to shallow anterior chambers of whom 3 (12%) had manifest angle closure glaucoma requiring surgical peripheral iridectomy. The aetiology of Fuchs's dystrophy and of ametropia is discussed and possible modes of association outlined. This previously unrecognised association gives a rational basis for the widely accepted practice of combining penetrating keratoplasty with lens extraction and has several other practical implications which are important in the differential diagnosis and treatment of Fuchs's dystrophy and angle closure glaucoma.\r"

The nasal cycle, the simultaneous congestion-decongestion response in the nasal cavities, reflects the dynamic lateralisation of the autonomic nervous system. Since this lateralisation presents with sympathetic activity induced by left brain hemisphere stimulation and parasympathetic activity induced by right hemisphere stimulation, it was subsequently demonstrated that forced unilateral nostril breathing induces selective contralateral hemispheric stimulation as measured by relative increases in the electroencephalographic amplitude in the contralateral hemisphere as well as alternating lateralisation of plasma catecholamines. Using this functional vagotomy, we report that left hemispheric stimulation by 20 minutes of forced unilateral right nostril breathing led to a significant bilateral decrease of 4.6 mmHg (25%) in intraocular pressure in 46 patients with open and closed angle glaucoma. However, it significantly increased the IOP in three patients with neovascular, one with juvenile onset, and one with closed angle glaucoma.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-one cases of conjunctival melanoma treated between 1960 and 1988 were studied to determine factors that might affect outcome in patients with such lesions. The therapeutic procedures performed were local excision (16), local excision followed by brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (32), local excision followed by cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen (16), brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (12), local excision followed by external beam irradiation (3), and local excision followed by brachytherapy and cryotherapy (2). The median follow-up period was 5.5 years (longest 26, shortest 1 year). Sixty two patients (76.5%) showed a complete regression of the melanoma, 19 (23.5%) developed recurrences, and 15 (18.5%) died from metastases. The melanomas had developed with almost equal frequency from a pre-existing naevus (25.9%), from primary acquired melanosis (25.9%), and 'de novo' (30.9%). Small tumours had a higher chance of regressing (80.6%) than larger ones (68.6%). The cumulative survival rate was 76% after five years and 60% after 10 years from any causes of death and 87.6% after five years and 76.3% after 10 years from deaths caused by metastases. Most deaths from metastases occurred within 5 years. At 88.5%, the cumulative survival rate of patients with small tumours (less than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and less than 2 mm thickness) was significantly higher than that of patients with larger tumours (more than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and/or more than 2 mm thickness) with 65% after eight years. Local excision followed by beta ray irradiation (Sr-90/Y-90) or cryotherapy can be recommended as the treatment of choice. Nevertheless the behaviour of conjunctival melanomas remains unpredictable in individual cases.\r"

In these eyes recovery of the blood-aqueous barrier was unaffected by the use of preoperative indomethacin, the surgeon, the type of section, or the type of fixation of the implant. In eyes recovering normally after cataract surgery the rate of recovery of the blood-aqueous barrier can be expressed by a in the equation a = (y-b)/x, in which y is the logarithm of the anterior chamber fluorescence, x is the time after surgery, and b is a constant for each patient which is the anterior chamber fluorescence measured immediately after surgery.

Most of these compliant children were cured within three months, with shorter treatment times on average for the younger children. The initial improvement of visual acuity was also faster at 2 years than at 4 years of age. Anisometropes with moderate amblyopia at the start of treatment were over-represented in the group with low compliance. We conclude that early diagnosis of strabismus in combination with general population screening at the age of 4 to detect amblyopia caused by anisometropia or microstrabismus seems to be efficacious for the cure of most cases. The major factor in treatment failure was found to be inadequate adherence to the treatment regimen.\r"

Use of a pneumotonometric probe linked to a Langham ocular blood flow system enabled readings of intraocular pressure and its variation with heart rate (ocular pulse) to be taken in erect and supine positions. Pulsatile ocular blood flow was calculated from these values by means of the pressure-volume relationship previously described for living human eyes. Assumption of the supine posture was accompanied by a significant rise in intraocular pressure; in normal eyes (mean, with SEM) (3.1 (0.4) mmHg, p less than 0.0001) and to a greater extent in ocular hypertensive eyes (4.7 (0.6) mmHg, p less than 0.0001). The POBF did not differ significantly between normotensive and ocular hypertensive groups in either the erect or supine postures. In both groups, however, assumption of the supine posture was accompanied by a significant fall in POBF (normals: -121 (21) microliters/min, p less than 0.0001; ocular hypertensives: -75 (16) microliters/min, p less than 0.0002). These reductions in POBF represent decrements of 27.5 (3.0)% and 17.1 (3.8)% respectively. Pulsatile ocular blood flow is reduced in the supine posture, and this may result in tissue hypoxia in subjects at risk of developing glaucoma. A companion paper describes the measurement of POBF in a group of patients with chronic open angle glaucoma treated with topical timolol 0.25%.\r"

Readings were taken with subjects in both the erect and supine positions by means of a pneumotonometric probe to measure intraocular pressure (IOP), linked to a Langham ocular blood flow system. Assumption of the supine posture was associated with a significant increase in IOP in all phases of the study. Treatment with timolol lowered the mean IOP in comparison with the untreated phase (-4.4 (SEM 0.6) mmHg, p less than 0.001) but had no effect on the postural change. A significant reduction in POBF was recorded on assumption of the supine posture (-66 (SEM 18) microliters/min, p less than 0.001), representing a mean decrement of 19%. However, there were no significant differences in POBF between treated and untreated phases of the study. Comparison of the values obtained in patients with glaucoma (COAG) after withdrawal of treatment with those in subjects with ocular hypertension revealed that there was no significant difference in intraocular pressure between the two groups. However, both POBF (-68 (SEM 29) microliters/min) and the pulse amplitude of the intraocular pressure (ocular pulse: -0.45 (SEM) 0.14 mmHg) were significantly lower in the COAG patients. Pulsatile ocular blood flow is significantly lower in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma. Furthermore, the POBF and the postural response of these patients is not improved by the use of topical timolol therapy.\r"

We studied seroprevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I in patients with various ocular disorders who are residents of south-west Japan, one of the endemic areas of HTLV-I. Of 310 patients with ocular disease 72 (23.2%) were seropositive. This seroprevalence did not differ significantly from that of the general population of the area. As regards individual ocular diseases, aetiologically undefined nonspecific uveitis showed a significantly high seropositivity for HTLV-I. Of 44 patients 18 (40.9%) were seropositive. Their clinical features were acute or subacute, transient and sometimes recurrent, and granulomatous changes in the anterior uvea.

We conclude that appropriately designed pattern VEP testing is a valuable complement to careful (preferably computerised, static) perimetry. In addition, our findings support the contention that, in glaucomatous disease of the optic nerve, rudimentary pattern processing mechanisms--that is 'Y'-type units of the magnocellular pathways--may be affected earlier than luminance processing mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin. Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion. The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively. Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta. Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied. In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg). Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments. Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses). By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05). We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin.\r"

  ".W": "A model system consisting of thrombin-stimulated bovine platelet releasates (PRthr) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEs) was developed to determine if the interaction between platelets and endothelial cells regulates fibrinolysis. Zymographic analysis indicated that PRthr treatment of BAEs decreases urokinase and increases type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity. Although PRthr did not affect the overall rate of BAE protein synthesis, it increased PAI-1 biosynthesis within 6 hours. This increase was complete by 12 hours, with maximum stimulation at 10 to 15 micrograms/mL PRthr (1 microgram approximately 10(7) platelets). Neutralizing antibodies to transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) reduced this effect by 75%. Treatments that activate latent TGF beta (eg, acidification or plasmin) increased this effect approximately fivefold, suggesting that TGF beta in PRthr exists in both a latent (approximately 80%) and an active (approximately 20%) form. In contrast to PRthr, adenosine diphosphate-prepared platelet releasates did not increase PAI-1 synthesis before acidification, indicating that they contain only the latent form of TGF beta. These results suggest that platelets can modulate the fibrinolytic system of the endothelium through the release of TGF beta, and that the mechanism by which the platelets are activated can influence the relative amount of active TGF beta.\r"

Although the primary structure of GM-CSF is known from cDNA cloning, the relationship between structure and function of GM-CSF is not fully understood. Fifteen different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human GM-CSF were generated to map immunologically distinct areas of the molecule. Each of the MoAbs was biotinylated and shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to bind to recombinant GM-CSF that had been affixed to a solid phase. Each of the 15 unconjugated MoAbs was then used to compete with each biotinylated MoAb for binding to GM-CSF. These cross-blocking studies identified eight distinct epitopes of native GM-CSF. Seven of these epitopes were also present in denatured GM-CSF by Western blotting, and four of the epitopes were at least partially conserved on GM-CSF that was reduced in beta-mercaptoethanol. MoAbs to four of eight epitopes neutralized both recombinant (glycosylated and nonglycosylated) and natural human GM-CSF in a GM colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assay and blocked GM-CSF-induced activation of neutrophils. For most of the antibodies there was a good correlation between neutralizing activity and the capacity to block binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils or blasts. Non-neutralizing antibodies to one epitope partially blocked binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils. None of the MoAbs neutralized interleukin-3, G-CSF, or M-CSF. The locations of seven of the epitopes could be partially mapped with regard to the amino acid structure by determining reactivity to GM-CSF synthetic peptides or to human-mouse chimeric GM-CSFs. The neutralizing antibodies were found to map to amino acids 40-77, 78-94, or 110-127. Thus, these MoAbs are useful to identify functional domains of GM-CSF and in identifying regions that are likely to be involved in receptor interaction.\r"

This bispecific Ab had a molecular mass of 100 to 110 Kd, and the capacity to react with both CD3+ T cells and CD10+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. We studied whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) could lyse patient CD10+ ALL cells after addition of the bispecific Ab. As effector CTLs, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CTL clones were used. When IL-2-stimulated PBMCs were assayed for cytotoxicity to 61Cr-labeled CD10+ ALL cells, their activity was shown to be markedly enhanced by the addition of the bispecific Ab. Most of the CTL clones established lacked cytotoxicity for CD10+ ALL cells, but addition of the bispecific Ab induced a significant level of cytotoxicity. CTLs derived from ALL patients also showed significant cytotoxicity for autologous CD10+ ALL cells after addition of the bispecific Ab. However, this Ab did not affect the cytotoxicity of CTLs when CD10- leukemic cells were used as the targets. These findings suggest that the bispecific Ab can be used for immunotherapy in patients with CD10+ ALL.\r"

  ".W": "During an 8-year period, 3,638 children from institutions of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifty-seven patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) ALL. Blast cells obtained at diagnosis from 13 of these 57 cases (23%) were also found to have partial or complete monosomy 7 (-7). This subgroup of children with Ph1/-7 ALL was comprised primarily of older males with early B-lineage ALL. Bone marrow specimens from six Ph1/-7 patients were studied further using the polymerase chain reaction and primers that flank the ALL, and chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoints to determine the molecular characteristic of the 9;22 translocation. Rearrangements were detected in RNA from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood cells of six patients, although four were in hematologic remission at the time of the analysis. Five cases showed the ALL breakpoint, while one child with Ph1/-7 showed the chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoint. The induction failure rate was much higher in this subgroup (31%) as compared with Ph1-negative cases, and the projected duration of event-free survival reflected the aggressive nature of this subgroup because no children are projected to remain in remission at 2 years. ALL with both the 9;22 translocation and -7 appears to represent a unique and previously undescribed subgroup of childhood ALL associated with a particularly adverse outcome. Leukemic transformation in such patients may involve the interaction of a dominant oncogene (Ph1) and a tumor suppressor gene (-7).\r"

  ".W": "The configuration of the MYC gene in diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) with translocations involving band 8q24 [t(8q24)] has not been systematically studied. We collected cytogenetic and clinical data on 171 consecutive cases of DLCL, including cleaved, noncleaved, and immunoblastic types, of which 96 had DNA available and 124 had abnormal karyotypes. The cases with DNA available were evaluated for MYC rearrangement (MYC-R) by Southern hybridization of EcoRI-digested tumor DNA using an exon-1 probe, a combination of probe and enzyme known to detect over 85% of breaks in sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma. In cases studied at diagnosis, MYC-R, t(8;14)(q24;q32), or other t(8q24) were not prognostically significant. Among the 124 cases with karyotypic abnormalities, seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus was significantly more common in cases with a t(8q24) (72%) than in cases without it (9%) (P less than .05). Of the four cases with an MYC -R, two had a t(8;14), one had a t(7;8;14)(p15;q24;q32), and one had a t(8;?)(q24;?) and a del(8)(q24). In the three previous cases with translocations involving 8q24 and 14q32, comigration of the rearranged MYC band with either the J region or the switch-mu region of the Ig heavy chain gene could not be demonstrated, leaving the 14q32 breakpoint undefined at the molecular level. Among the remaining 72 cases where both an abnormal karyotype and molecular data were available, 11 had a t(8q24), either t(8;14) or t(8;22)(q24;q11), in the absence of an MYC-R. In these cases, the 8q24 break was presumably located outside of the EcoRI MYC fragment. All 15 cases with a t(8q24) were also screened for point mutations in the PvuII site in the first exon of MYC; two cases that were not MYC-R showed loss of this restriction site. These results indicate that in most DLCL with t(8;14) or other t(8q24), the 8q24 breakpoint lies away from the MYC gene; in a minority of these cases, point mutations in regulatory noncoding regions were detected.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of competitive inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase by compactin on the in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood myeloid leukemia cells were studied using the cells from 45 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. The cells from 58% of these patients showed a dose-related inhibition of DNA synthesis when incubated with compactin. Unexpectedly, cells from 18% of the patients were resistant to the inhibitory effects of compactin on DNA synthesis and responded to the HMG CoA reductase inhibition with an actual increase in the incorporation of 14C-labeled thymidine into DNA. Another 18% of the patients studied displayed both inhibition and stimulation of DNA synthesis in a biphasic response depending on the particular concentration of compactin used. The maximum enhanced rates of cellular DNA synthesis were observed with lower compactin concentrations (5 x 10(-7) mol/L) than were required for maximum inhibition of DNA synthesis (10(-5) mol/L). Leukemia cells displaying a stimulated response to compactin had a significantly lower baseline DNA synthetic rate than did cells that showed an inhibitory response of DNA synthesis to compactin. There was no correlation between these cells' varying DNA synthetic response to compactin and measures of baseline HMG CoA reductase activity or acetate conversion to cholesterol. Whereas the observation of cellular DNA synthesis stimulation by HMG CoA reductase inhibition has not been observed in other mammalian cells and seems paradoxical, explanations may emerge in light of our growing knowledge concerning the importance of isoprenylation for the function of certain cell regulatory proteins.\r"

  ".U": "91137804\r", 
  ".W": "Multiple myeloma is a disease in which conventional chemotherapy has only limited value, but which may be ideal for treatment with passive antibody against a suitable cell surface antigen on the neoplastic plasma cell. The CD38 antigen is known to be present on the majority of neoplastic plasma cells, and this was confirmed by detailed examination of bone marrow aspirates from three patients. Strong expression of CD38 was confined to cells which, by the criteria of light-scattering profiles and possession of cytoplasmic Ig, were plasma cells. The vast majority of neoplastic plasma cells appeared to be involved. Using a cell line as a model, it was found that the CD38 antigen acts as a target for a chimeric antibody prepared from the antibody OKT10. The chimeric antibody consists of the Fab portion of the mouse monoclonal antibody linked by a stable thioether bond to an Fc molecule derived from human IgG1, thereby forming mouse Fab-human Fc. In contrast to the parent antibody, the chimeric molecule mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) very efficiently with human blood mononuclear effector cells, and is effective at low concentration. Also, even though the CD38 antigen is present on natural killer cells, there appears to be little deleterious action of the antibody on effector cell function. The antibody also failed to affect the growth of progenitor cells of the granulocyte/macrophage or erythroid lineages present in normal bone marrows, despite the suspicion that these cells express the antigen. Other advantages of the CD38 molecule are that it is not found in the serum of patients with myeloma, and it does not appear to modulate in vitro. Fourteen patients with florid myeloma and on various chemotherapeutic regimes had an undiminished capacity to mediate ADCC with the chimeric antibody, when compared with normal individuals. The maintenance of ADCC activity, coupled with the known suppression of the antibody response in these patients, augers well for treatment with chimeric antibody.\r"

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment restores cell maturation. We have isolated the first permanent cell line with t(15;17), derived from the marrow of a patient with APL in relapse. The establishment of the cell line, its morphologic, karyotypic, and immunohistochemical features are reported. RA induced cell line maturation. Cells strongly expressed myeloid markers, but also some T-cell markers. Additional karyotypic abnormalities, a 12p rearrangement and the possible presence of a homogeneous staining region (HSR) on 19q+ are discussed both in relation to T-cell (CD2, CD4) and monocyte (CD9) markers, and to the acquired cell growth autonomy. The cell line represents a remarkable tool for biomolecular studies.\r"

In a posttreatment bone marrow specimen, which was interpreted as a regenerating bone marrow morphologically and which demonstrated a normal karyotype cytogenetically, trisomy X was found in 16 of 1,000 interphase cells. This finding indicated the presence of leukemic cells that were undetected by conventional morphologic and cytogenetic techniques (ie, minimal residual disease). Cytogenetic studies of a relapse specimen obtained after a sex-mismatched bone marrow transplant showed only a normal female karyotype in each of 40 metaphase cells, suggesting that the relapse occurred in donor cells. However, interphase analysis demonstrated trisomy X in more than 80% of interphase cells and indicated that the relapse was of the original clone and was not a transformation of donor cells. This case illustrates that interphase analysis can be useful as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis in the detection of minimal residual disease and in the analysis of interphase cells that are not accessible to routine cytogenetic methods. It also illustrates that previously reported instances of relapse of leukemia in donor cells could have been incorrect if supported by cytogenetic data alone.\r"

However, whether EBV has a pathogenetic role in these tumors or is a passenger virus has not been conclusively demonstrated. One element to distinguish between these two possibilities is to determine whether EBV infection has preceded and, thus, possibly contributed to clonal expansion, or whether infection has occurred after clonal expansion and thus is unlikely to contribute to pathogenesis. Toward this end we analyzed the structure of the heterogeneous genomic termini of EBV as markers of clonal infection in a panel of eBL (11 cases), sBL (9 cases), and AIDS-NHL (10 cases) biopsies. We show that EBV termini are uniformly clonal in sBL, eBL, and AIDS-NHL, strongly suggesting that EBV infection has preceded and, thus, most likely contributed to clonal expansion in these malignancies.\r"

To address this question, we have used a newly developed procedure for the isolation of aged erythrocytes that involves the biotinylation of rabbit red blood cells, in vivo aging of these cells, and the eventual in vitro recovery of the aged red blood cells by their affinity for an avidin support. Erythrocytes isolated with this method were found to have near-normal levels of cell-associated Ig throughout their 60-day lifespan.

High specificity of the PCR assay applied could be shown by failure to amplify DNA extracted from a wide range of other viruses frequently infecting marrow transplant recipients. The PCR technique allowed us to diagnose viremia and viruria in 20 (83%) of 24 seropositive patients after BMT, whereas culture assays showed 16 (67%) of 24 of these patients to be viruric and 9 (37%) of 24 cases to be viremic. Slot-blot hybridization showed a frequency of viruria and viremia in 12 (50%) of 24 seropositive patients. By application of PCR techniques, HCMV detection could be achieved even in the very early posttransplant period. HCMV was detected in five patients even before the onset of clinical symptoms of acute graft-versus-host disease. Analysis by PCR techniques of 33 organ biopsy specimens from patients after BMT showed the presence of HCMV in 13 of 14 liver samples obtained from patients with HCMV viremia; three liver specimens from patients without viremia were negative by all the techniques applied. HCMV could also be demonstrated in postmortem lung biopsy specimens from all patients (n = 10) with interstitial pneumonia.\r"

HIVIG had high titers of antibody to p24, glycoprotein 41 (gp41), and gp120, group-specific neutralizing activity, and binding to the gp120 hypervariable loop region. It inhibited syncytia formation. At low concentration, it enhanced viral production of HIV-1 in infected peripheral blood monocytes but was inhibitory at higher concentration. HIVIG directed group-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HIV-infected targets. For a period of 6 to 28 months, plasma donors kept stable antibody titers and had a 1.0% decrease in CD4+ cells per month. One gram per kilogram HIVIG injected in two juvenile chimpanzees was well tolerated and did not transmit HIV, as measured by negative cell culture, IgM immune response to HIV proteins, and polymerase chain reaction. The mean half-life of HIV-1 p24 antibody was 15 days. These preliminary data suggest that HIVIG is a safe product suitable for clinical trial in HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is a good model for the study of myeloproliferation because JCML hematopoietic progenitor cells grow in vitro at very low cell densities without the addition of exogenous stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that this proliferation is dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and that removal of monocytes from the cell population before culture eliminates this \"spontaneous\" myeloproliferation, suggesting a paracrine role of monocyte stimulation. However, subsequent studies have shown that increased GM-CSF production from the JCML monocytes is not a consistent finding and therefore not a plausible sole mechanism. In examining hematopoietic growth factor dose-response curves, both JCML GM and erythroid nonadherent progenitor cell populations displayed a marked and selective hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. Responses to interleukin-3 and G-CSF were identical to control dose-response curves. This is the first demonstration of a myeloid leukemia in which hypersensitivity to a specific growth factor appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "In a double-blind study, we compared the postoperative (post-op) blood loss in 161 children undergoing open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass whose immediate post-op transfusion requirements were met with either very fresh whole blood (VFWB), 24- to 48-hour-old whole blood or reconstituted whole blood (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma [FFP], and platelets). Assignment to treatment groups was not strictly random but dependent, in part, on the ability of families to provide directed donors for fresh blood. The three patient groups were comparable with respect to patient age, pre-op coagulation profiles (bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, fibrin split products, fibrinogen, and platelet aggregation tests) difficulty of operative procedures and time spent on CPB. Mean 24-hour post-op blood loss in milliliters per kilogram was 50.9 +/- 9.3 in the VFWB group, 44.8 +/- 6.0 in the 24- to 48-hour-old group, and 74.2 +/- 8.9 in the reconstituted group (p = .03). When blood loss was compared in the 93 children less than 2 years of age, mean blood loss was 52.3 +/- 10.8 in the VFWB group, 51.7 +/- 7.4 in the 24- to 48-hour-old group, and 96.2 +/- 10.7 in the reconstituted group (P = .001). For subjects who had received reconstituted blood, 30-minute and 3-hour post-op platelet aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate (10 mumol/L) and 30-minute aggregation response to epinephrine (2.5 mumol/L) were more depressed than in the VFWB and 24- to 48-hour groups (P less than .001, P = .005, and P = .02). Comparison of other post-op coagulation tests could not explain the increased blood loss in the reconstituted group. We conclude that the transfusion of less than 48 hours old whole blood is associated with significantly less post-op blood loss than the transfusion of packed red blood cells, FFP, and platelets in children under 2 years old who underwent complex cardiac surgery. The blood losses associated with the transfusion of VFWB and 24- to 48-hour-old blood are comparable and may be, in part, due to better functioning platelets.\r"

This treatment increased the neutrophil counts (2.7- to 28.0-fold) in 12 of the 20 patients. Increasing doses (800 or 1,200 micrograms/m2 per day) were administered to five patients who had not responded to the initial dose, and three showed an increase in neutrophil count. Differential counts of bone marrow (BM) aspirates showed an increase in the myeloid/erythroid ratio. The response was transient, however, and the neutrophil count returned to baseline within 2 to 10 days of discontinuing treatment. No severe toxicity attributable to rhG-CSF was observed. The results suggest that this agent is effective in stimulating granulopoiesis in children with aplastic anemia. Our study also indicates that rhG-CSF will be particularly useful in managing patients with aplastic anemia complicated by bacterial or fungal infection.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred forty-seven patients with Ann Arbor stages I and II diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) were treated with combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxyrubicin, prednisone, and low-dose bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo) and involved-field radiation (IF XRT) between 1974 and 1984. A complete remission (CR) was attained by 54 of 57 patients with stage I disease and by 78 of 90 patients with stage II disease. Thirty-five patients had relapsing disease that occurred within 3 years in 31. The overall 10-year survival rate, counting all deaths, for patients with stage I was 72% as compared with 43% for patients with stage II (P less than .01). Determinate survival rates, censoring eight unrelated deaths, were similar to the overall survival rates: 77% and 51%, respectively. A multivariate analysis identified three independent prognostic factors: age, tumor extent, and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level. When the combined effect of tumor extent and LDH level were taken into consideration in the analysis, three risk groups for survival were identified. The best group, which consists of patients with minimum tumor and normal LDH levels, had a 10-year determinate survival of 79%. Patients with extensive tumors and elevated LDH levels had the poorest survival rate of 44%. An intermediate-risk group with a determinant survival of 62% was composed of patients with either extensive tumors or elevated LDH levels. These differences demonstrate the need to develop different treatment strategies based on risk factors for survival for patients with apparently localized Ann Arbor stages I/II DLCL.\r"

After timed incubation in media with fetal bovine serum, 29% of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), 24% of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), and 52% of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) bone marrow progenitors expressed ICAM-1. This finding, which is consistent with the detection of ICAM-1 on acute non-lymphoblastic leukemic blasts, is at variance with recent reports. ICAM-1 was also detected on bone marrow blasts, proerythroblasts, promyelocytes, and cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, but was not detected on erythroblasts, normoblasts, neutrophilic myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, or on most lymphocytes. These results indicate that maturation of cells of the erythroid and myeloid lineage is associated with loss of ICAM-1. The distribution of ICAM-1 on bone marrow progenitors, early precursor cells, and accessory cells in conjunction with the function of this molecule in cell-cell interactions suggests that ICAM-1 may play a role in the cell-cell and cell-stromal interactions that regulate hematopoiesis.\r"

In the present study, we demonstrated that low concentrations of bFGF (0.2 to 2 ng/mL) enhance myelopoiesis in long-term human BM culture. Addition of bFGF to long-term BM cultures resulted in an increase in (a) the number of nonadherent cells (sixfold), particularly those of the neutrophil granulocyte series; (b) the number of nonadherent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-responsive progenitor cells; (c) the number of adherent foci of hematopoietic cells (10-fold); and (d) the number of progenitor cells in the adherent stromal cell layer. These effects were not noted with higher concentrations of bFGF (20 ng/mL). Thus, low concentrations of bFGF effectively augment myelopoiesis in human long-term BM cultures, and bFGF may therefore be a regulator of the hematopoietic system in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91137825\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes human granulopoiesis, specifically augmenting basophilic cell differentiation observed in methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assays of human peripheral blood. Because the NGF effect was seen in the presence of conditioned medium derived from a human T-cell line (Mo-CM) containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we examined interactions of purified NGF and recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) on granulocyte growth and differentiation. rhGM-CSF stimulated a dose-dependent increase in methylcellulose colony growth at concentrations between 0.1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, and in the presence of NGF at 500 ng/mL this effect was enhanced. The number of basophilic cell colony-forming units (CFU-Baso) and histamine-positive colonies increased synergistically when NGF was added to rhGM-CSF. Furthermore, because Mo-CM acts with sodium butyrate to promote basophilic differentiation of alkaline-passaged myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60, we also examined the interaction of NGF and Mo-CM or rhGM-CSF using this assay. In the presence of NGF, Mo-CM at concentrations of 0.5% to 20% vol/vol, and rhGM-CSF at concentrations of 0.1 U/mL to 100 U/mL synergistically increased histamine production by butyrate-induced, alkaline-passaged HL-60 cells; this was associated with the appearance of metachromatic, tryptase-negative, IgE receptor-positive cells. The effects of rhGM-CSF or Mo-CM were completely abrogated by a specific anti-rhGM-CSF neutralizing antibody in methylcellulose, with or without NGF; the NGF synergy with rhGM-CSF in the HL-60 assay was also inhibited by either anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-NGF antibody. These studies support the notion that differentiation in the basophilic lineage may be enhanced by NGF acting to increase the number of GM-CSF-responsive basophilic cell progenitors.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of two strains of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) with the mouse hematopoietic system has been studied. The immunosuppressive strain MVMi, but not the prototype virus MVMp, inhibited hematopoiesis in vitro, as judged by colony-forming assays of the erythroid burst-forming unit and granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) progenitors. Interestingly, primitive hematopoietic cells of the stem compartment (CFU-S12d), were equally susceptible to the MVMi cytotoxic infection, unravelling an unprecedented feature of virus-hematopoiesis interactions. The replication of both strains of MVM virus was evaluated in primary myeloid cells of long-term bone marrow cultures. A high viral DNA synthesis and maturation was observed in MVMi-infected myeloid cells, but it was undetectable in MVMp infections; moreover, the expression of the cytotoxic nonstructural NS-1 protein, a more reliable parameter of cell permissiveness to MVM infection, was only detected in MVMi-infected cells. Correspondingly, MVMi was propagated to high titers of infectious virus and it mediated an acute myelosuppression in these cultures. We conclude that MVMi has a wider tropism than was previously suspected and it is proposed that cytotoxic infection of hematopoietic stem cells, besides that of committed progenitors, may provide an additional basis to understand the pathogenesis of certain animal and human bone marrow failures of viral etiology.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) acts as a potent enhancer of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro. We have analyzed the effects of TNF alpha on the expression of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on AML cells. Incubation of blasts from seven patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/mL) and subsequent binding studies using 125I-GM-CSF and 125I-IL-3 show that TNF increases the specific binding of GM-CSF (30% to 280%) and IL-3 (40% to 600%) in all cases. From Scatchard plot analysis it appears that TNF upregulates (1) low-affinity GM-CSF binding sites, (2) common high-affinity IL-3/GM-CSF binding sites, and (3) unique (non-GM-CSF binding) IL-3 binding sites. The effect of TNF is dose dependent and is half maximal at a concentration of 100 U/mL, and becomes evident at 18 hours of incubation with TNF at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C. The GM-CSF dose-response curve of AML-colony-forming units plateaus at a higher level in the presence of TNF, which indicates that additional numbers of cells become responsive to GM-CSF. Incubation of AML blasts with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (protein kinase C activators) does not influence GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that receptor upregulation by TNF is not mediated through activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogates receptor upregulation induced by TNF. In contrast to these findings in AML, TNF does not upregulate GM-CSF receptor numbers on blood granulocytes or monocytes. We conclude that TNF exerts positive effects on growth factor receptor expression of hematopoietic cells.\r"
