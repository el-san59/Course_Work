The independent risk of fracture infection was increased in patients with grade IIIB or IIIC fractures, internal or external fixation, lower-leg fracture, any blood transfusion, or injuries resulting from motorcycle accidents or motor vehicle-pedestrian accidents. By stepwise multivariate logistic regression, the most significant risk factors were the grade of the fracture, internal or external fixation, and fractures of the lower leg. These risk factors all represent local wound characteristics, and we conclude that the most important actions by the surgeon to prevent infection involve local wound care. There was no relation between the timing of antibiotic administration or duration of antibiotic therapy and infection risk.\r"

The degree of receptor increase depended on the dose of TNF from 25 to 1250 pg/mL. Results of kinetic analysis confirmed this response: TNF, 250 pg/mL, caused an increase in the C3b receptor number within ten minutes. Purified neutrophils exhibited a similar increase in cell-surface C3b receptors dependent on the concentration of TNF. Tumor necrosis factor could be a mediator of granulocyte activation in patients.\r"

We also further defined the relationship between endotoxin injury, lipid peroxidation, and prostaglandin production. Sheep were given endotoxin alone (1 microgram/kg) or pretreated with catalase (32,500 U/kg) or ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg). Endotoxin alone resulted in an early prostanoid release, lipid peroxidation measured as circulating conjugated dienes both one and four hours after the administration of endotoxin, pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia, and increased protein permeability. Permeability was monitored by lymph flow and lymph protein content. Catalase pretreatment significantly attenuated all of these aspects of the endotoxin response. Ibuprofen prevented the early lung changes and blocked prostanoid release but did not attenuate the increased permeability. In addition, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition had a dual effect on lipid peroxidation, increasing initial conjugated diene levels while suppressing the later release. The initial effect was clearly related to cyclo-oxygenase blockade. The early conjugated diene release appears to be related to arachidonic acid metabolism and does not correspond to the degree of increased permeability. We conclude that H2O2 plays a major role in lung injury after endotoxin.\r"

All deaths occurred within 48 hours of injection and surviving mice, including those bearing abscesses, appeared to be healthy throughout the study. The number of mice with abscesses and the number of abscesses per group were at their maximum at two to four weeks. Groups with live bacteria had a substantial reduction in the number of abscesses between eight and 26 weeks, compared with two- and four-week values. Manual rupture of palpably large eight-week-old abscesses in 21 mice produced only one death and at autopsy two weeks later, all of the mice showed multiple smaller abscesses. Abscess formation appeared to be beneficial and the natural history of such may include spontaneous resolution without mortality.\r"

Four histologic patterns were seen on biopsy: explosive follicular hyperplasia (EFH), follicular involution (FI), a mixed pattern of EFH with FI in the same node, and lymphocyte depletion. Patients with FI and lymphocyte depletion had mean survival times that were significantly less than those for the subjects with EFH. The percentage of lymph node follicles with suppressor cell clusters (T8) in EFH lymph nodes was significantly higher (43% vs 8%) than in nodes from patients without risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Helper/suppressor T-cell ratios in control nodes were 1.6; in EFH nodes, 0.97; and in FI nodes, 0.88. A remarkable 33% of patients in this lymphadenopathy group ultimately developed large-cell (B-cell) lymphoma, suggesting that the follicular stimulation noted histologically played a role in the development of this neoplasm. These data show that there is a progressive destruction of lymph node follicles that correlates with the progression of the disease and that lymph node histologic features may provide important prognostic information.\r"

However, in mice treated with the combination of an oral antibiotic plus an immunosuppressive drug, the translocating bacteria spread systemically to the peritoneal cavity. When the treatment with clindamycin and prednisone was extended to 12 days, the mice died of lethal sepsis beginning eight days after treatment. Thus, the combination of intestinal bacterial overgrowth and host immunosuppression synergistically promoted bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract that resulted in lethal sepsis.\r"

Overall, 32 patients died due to sepsis, 26 of whom had positive blood cultures. During this period, 93 patients had 133 bacteremic episodes. The 26 bacteremic patients (28%) who died had larger burns (71% +/- 24%) than the 67 patients who survived (39% +/- 24%), as well as a higher incidence of inhalation injuries. The patients dying of sepsis also were more likely to have polymicrobial bacteremias than the survivors. The distribution of microorganisms causing bacteremia was different between the surviving and nonsurviving patients, with patients sustaining fatal bacteremias having a higher incidence of infections with gram-negative enteric organisms or Pseudomonas. Thus, increased burn size and the presence of an inhalation injury, polymicrobial bacteremia, or gram-negative bacteremia were associated with an increased mortality rate in bacteremic patients with burns.\r"

Lymphocytes from treated patients incorporated less thymidine when stimulated with concanavalin A or pokeweed mitogen, but not with phytohemagglutinin. The amount of IgM secreted by pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures from treated patients increased by 24%, while the amount of IgG remained constant. The changes in beta-lymphocyte number and functional response may have been induced by the increased serum IgG levels in the intravenous IgG-treated patients.\r"

Adult Wistar rats were grouped as follows: (1) freely fed, (2) 30% burn, (3) 30% burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, (4) pair fed, and (5) 30% burn and infection with recombinant cachectin. Compared with controls or animals only burned, burned and infected rats had a 100% increase in hepatic cachectin messenger RNA content, lost carcass protein, and exhibited muscle loss with sparing of liver mass. Tissue production of cachectin as well as other cytokines may be sufficient to mediate several body composition changes observed in response to injury and infection.\r"

Although these preparations have not been compared, clinical trials administering either preparation to septic patients have been instituted. The core/lipid A region of LPS represents an antigenic domain common to many, if not all, gram-negative microbes, and thus represents an ideal target site for antibody binding. We sought to determine (1) the protective capacity of similarly reactive IgG anti-core LPS/lipid A MAbs and PAbs, (2) whether the timing of administration was important, and (3) whether either would act additively with antimicrobial agents. Antibody was administered intravenously to outbred mice, and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was then administered intravenously or intraperitoneally with hemoglobin. Monoclonal antibodies and PAbs were equally protective, and protection was maximized by pretreatment, although the effect extended to four hours after bacterial challenge. Both MAbs and PAbs acted in concert with gentamicin hydrochloride to further reduce lethality. We concluded that MAbs and PAbs were equally protective and that clinical utility may eventually be dictated by ease and cost of antibody production.\r"

Urinary urea excretion declined, and splanchnic amino acid uptake was maintained only in group 2 subjects. Septic patients exhibited changes in amino acid and urea dynamics comparable to those of subjects receiving placebo. Insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production and plasma concentrations increased in group 2 in a fashion corresponding to the changes in nitrogen exchange, whereas septic patients exhibited no change in IGF-1 level. Therefore, in this septic patient group, exogenous hGH was ineffective in attenuating nitrogen losses and stimulating IGF-1 production. This supports the hypothesis that IGF-1 is a mediator of the anabolic effect of hGH.\r"

To delineate its mechanism more precisely, three experiments were performed using male Hartley guinea pigs that involved intermittent or continuous administration of endotoxin intraperitoneally for seven days and continuous infusion of low-dose endotoxin through the portal vein for five days. The doses of endotoxin were 0.3 mg, 0.36 mg, and 0.014 mg per 100 g of body weight per day, respectively. Hypermetabolic response was induced only in the experiment involving the infusion of endotoxin through the portal vein; the hypermetabolic response was correlated significantly with endotoxin levels in the plasma. These results indicate that endotoxin translocated from the gut into the mesenteric vein will induce hypermetabolism more readily than endotoxin translocated into the peritoneal cavity.\r"

Phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure changes in muscle energy stores of the left hind limb musculature of adult male rats during sepsis. Following control scans, cecal ligation and puncture were performed and scanning was repeated 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. The ratios of phosphocreatine (PCr) to inorganic phosphate (Pi), a measure of energy stores, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to Pi ratio, a measure of the energy available for immediate use, were determined from peak heights. Intracellular pH was calculated using the distance between Pi and PCr peaks. In surviving animals, a 40% decrease in PCr/Pi ratio (+/- SEM) was observed by 24 hours (22.3 +/- 3.0 at time 0 vs 13.3 +/- 2.8 at 24 hours), whereas energy availability (beta-ATP/Pi) was statistically unchanged (18.2 +/- 2.2 at time 0 vs 15.2 +/- 1.2 at 48 hours). Intracellular pH did not change. Both PCr/Pi and ATP/Pi ratios were inversely correlated with time. In this model of documented peritonitis, skeletal muscle energy metabolism is rapidly altered following severe infection, and these changes can be detected using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\r"

On follow-up assessment, favorable outcomes were noted in 107 patients (71%), 17 had major disabilities (11%), and 26 had died (17%). During hospitalization, vasospasm was diagnosed in 63 patients (42%) and rebleeding occurred in 39 (25%). Operations were performed throughout the first week after SAH; results of operation were similar on each day. A lower rate of good recovery was observed among patients operatively treated four to seven days after SAH than among those operated on earlier. The admitting neurologic condition influenced outcome after early operation, but age did not have a major impact. We find that aneurysm surgery can be performed within one week of SAH with acceptable results, although there is room for improvement.\r"

All eight patients with painful neuropathy had overt symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in both patients with this syndrome. Both died from overwhelming sepsis within six months of the neuropathy's onset. Patients with mononeuropathy multiplex had a variable course. Immunosuppressant medication had no effect in two patients.\r"

We hypothesize that elevations in levels of phosphomonoesters, precursors of membrane phospholipids, occur early in the pathogenesis of AD and precede the appearance of SPs. In contrast, elevations in levels of phosphodiesters, breakdown products of phospholipids, reflect degeneration of neural membranes and will correlate with the appearance of SPs. Correlative phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and morphologic studies conducted to test this hypothesis disclosed that elevations in levels of phosphomonoesters had a negative correlation with the numbers of SPs, and elevations in levels of phosphodiesters had a positive correlation with the numbers of SPs. No correlations were observed for either membrane parameter and neurofibrillary tangles. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that aberrations in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids are early metabolic events in the pathogenesis of AD.\r"

All four cases had the autosomal dominant form of the disease, and aside from severe dementia, all developed myoclonus and became mute before death. The degeneration observed was unlike that seen in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease because it lacked astrocytosis and had a different distribution of lesions. Moreover, the abundance of neurofibrillary changes and senile plaques was consistent with Alzheimer's disease. None of the other 23 cases were familial, and none developed myoclonus or mutism; three of them had minor vacuolation limited to the temporal lobe. The four cases with severe spongy change described are the first, to our knowledge, in which vacuolar or spongy change has been associated with the familial form of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

After three months of treatment the number of cysts on computed tomography had decreased from 185 to six; a 97% reduction in the number of lesions. Total remission of all cysts was seen in nine patients. Two cases had been unsuccessfully treated before with praziquantel, in both instances albendazole therapy was effective with 100% improvement.

Later, though pure alexia in kana persisted, his kanji reading improved markedly, but with little improvement of kanji writing. We speculate that different pathways are involved in kanji reading and writing. Wernicke's area and its surrounding left middle temporal lobe might play the most important role for kanji reading when visual information is transmitted by any pathway. The pathway from Wernicke's area to the left occipital lobe via the middle and inferior temporal pathway may be indispensable for kanji writing. We postulate \"agraphia without alexia in kanji\" due to left inferior temporal subcortical damage.\r"

Visual function improved in all ten eyes. A decision to operate was based on progressive loss of visual acuity or visual field unresponsive to medical therapy, accompanied by echographic evidence of a distended optic nerve sheath (positive 30 degrees test). Follow-up ranged from four to 11 months. Four patients underwent subarachnoid iopamidol (Isovue) contrast injection followed by orbital computed tomography. The subarachnoid space totally filled in all patients. No evidence of fibrosis or obstruction of the optic nerve sheath existed; however, leakage of dye from the optic nerve sheath could not be demonstrated. Postoperative complications included transient diplopia and transient atonic pupil (one patient each). Our results indicate that optic nerve sheath decompression improves and protects visual function in patients with pseudotumor cerebri who demonstrate progressive visual field loss and fluid in the optic nerve sheath.\r"

Instead of removing a single, rectangular section of optic nerve meninges, the operation was modified by making at least three longitudinal incisions in the sheath and then lysing arachnoid adhesions with a tenotomy hook. Twenty-one of the 23 patients demonstrated improved visual function after the initial surgery for a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 21.5 +/- 12.3 months (median, 25 months; range, three to 45 months) without reoperation or reinstitution or oral corticosteroid and diuretic therapies. The two patients failing to improve after the first surgical procedure initially had a single meningeal window created and subsequently improved following reoperation with the modified procedure. Twelve of 21 patients with bilateral visual loss had improved visual function bilaterally after unilateral surgery. Six of the 21 patients needed bilateral surgery, and the other three had minor visual field defects in the second eye not severe enough to warrant surgery. Preoperative optic disc pallor did not predict a poor postoperative result. Optic nerve surgery improved the visual function in six patients who had failed to recover vision after one or more lumbar-peritoneal shunts.\r"

Four patients with maxillary sinus mucoceles are presented; one of these patients had a concurrent retention cyst in the orbit. Clinical history, radiologic findings, and histopathologic mechanisms are discussed. Mucocele is a recognized complication of the Caldwell-Luc procedure and midface trauma. Blockage of the sinus ostia was the cause previously proposed to explain antral mucocele development. Clinical and histopathologic features may support more than one single mechanism for the pathogenesis of maxillary sinus cysts. Maxillary sinus mucocele or retention cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos or enophthalmos following blowout fracture of the orbital floor.\r"

Fluorescein angiography and angioscopy demonstrated the masses to be composed of numerous vessels supplied by the retinal circulation. Slow growth was documented in one patient. Visual loss was variable and was due to leakage-related complications, including exudative detachment, recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, and cystoid macular edema. Four patients were treated with cryopexy, and in all four, this successfully caused involution of the lesions. Two patients had improvement in vision after treatment: one had stabilization, and one had deterioration. This report provides support for the existence of a distinct entity that we have called hemangiomalike mass of the retina, since no histopathologic evidence is yet available (to our knowledge). It also supports the use of judicious cryopexy to lesions associated with visual loss.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed by a clinical examination and an electroretinogram. The X chromosomes of a pregnant woman, an offspring of a carrier female, showed a different haplotype to that of her affected brother, at three linked loci that flanked the RS gene. She was excluded as a carrier with a high probability; hence, the fetus was unlikely to inherit an abnormal gene for this X-linked trait. In informed families a DNA-based diagnosis can serve as a valuable complement to an electroretinogram and a clinical examination in the diagnosis of RS, since these carrier females cannot currently be identified by other means.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms involved in onchocercal sclerosing keratitis in humans, we developed a model of onchocercal interstitial keratitis in guinea pigs. Onchocerca volvulus antigens injected intrastromally into corneas of preimmunized Hartley guinea pigs induced an intense stromal keratitis with corneal edema, neovascularization, and infiltration with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. This reaction subsided after two weeks. Repeated intrastromal injection resulted in an exacerbation of the keratitis and ultimately in residual scarring. These findings are consistent clinically and histopathologically with the chronic interstitial keratitis observed in humans. To define which antigens induce the corneal reaction, O volvulus antigens were separated by molecular sieve chromatography and injected intrastromally. The highest activity was shown to reside in the fraction containing molecules of intermediate molecular weight. This model will be useful in defining O volvulus antigens and their role in sclerosing keratitis as well as in elucidating the immune mechanisms involved.\r"

  ".W": "Lateral orbitotomy is used for the removal of orbital tumors and for orbital decompression. Most surgeons make saw cuts through the lateral orbital rim and remove and rewire the bone. This procedure is time-consuming and requires repair of the lateral canthal structures. We describe a technique using an air-driven \"acorn-tipped\" bur that removes the posterolateral lip of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone and effectively straightens the external surface of the lateral orbital wall. This permits removal of the bone without serious injury to the periorbita. The technique creates a trapezoidal orbitotomy measuring approximately 20 mm anteroposterior, 25 mm at the anterior vertical base, and 6 mm at the posterior base. The orbital soft tissues can thus be safely exposed without removal of the lateral rim. We operated on one patient with cavernous hemangioma (27 X 21 X 19 mm) and three patients with bilateral Graves' ophthalmopathy. We discuss anatomic considerations for the prevention of complications, including injury to the frontotemporal branches of the facial nerve, injury to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, and inadvertent penetration of the dura.\r"

  ".W": "Rheumatoid factor (RF) is often detected in subjects who do not have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To determine if the presence of RF is predictive of the development of RA, 2,712 Pima Indians of Arizona, 20 years of age or older, initially without RA, have been observed for up to 19 years with biennial examinations. These included a medical history, physical examination of the joints, radiographs, and RF determination by sheep cell agglutination test. During the study period, 70 new cases of RA developed. When the population at risk was stratified by RF titer, with reclassification at subsequent examinations if the RF titer changed, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of RA increased with higher titers of RF. The incidence of RA (in cases per 1,000 person-years) according to RF titer was 2.4 (RF titer less than 1:2); 6.7 (titer 1:2-1:16); 11.0 (titer 1:32-1:256); and 48.3 (titer greater than 1:256) (P less than 0.001). The same trend was also found within each age and sex group, and within groups defined by the number of American Rheumatism Association criteria present before the definite diagnosis. We conclude that the presence of RF, in subjects without RA, is a risk factor for the development of RA, and that this risk is related to the RF titer. It is also suggested that RF may represent a marker of the earliest phases of the pathogenetic process of RA, that may be detectable before the appearance of other features that permit a clinical diagnosis.\r"

The primary focus was on patients' satisfaction with their physical abilities and the types of comparisons that patients make between themselves and other people (i.e., social comparisons) when evaluating their abilities. Seventy-five women with RA were interviewed. Findings indicate that satisfaction with one's physical abilities appears to mediate the relationship between physical and psychological impairment. Furthermore, satisfaction was associated not only with one's abilities per se, but also with the types of comparisons patients made when evaluating their abilities. These findings help explain differences in the levels of psychological well-being noted among individuals with the same degree of physical impairment.\r"

Using previously published criteria to classify the outcome, we found that 60% of the HCQ group, 46% of the DP group, and 39% of the placebo group responded favorably after 12 months of therapy. Data from examinations between the initial and final assessments were used to determine when the response first occurred. Approximately 50% of all patients who showed improvement at 12 months had already done so by 2 months. After 6 months, 96% of the DP group, 88% of the HCQ group, and 85% of the placebo group responders had met the criteria for response. The average time until response was attained was 105 days for the DP group, 129 days for the HCQ group, and 140 days for the placebo group. Our results indicate that a favorable response to these slow-acting antirheumatic drugs is unlikely if improvement has not occurred within the first 6 months of therapy.\r"

These 40 patients were screened by history, physical examination, and laboratory study. We soon noticed that many patients had generalized joint laxity. Eighteen of the first 40 individuals satisfied established criteria for the hypermobile joint syndrome. An additional 3 were found to have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a forme fruste of this disorder. Many were markedly hypermobile and could perform a number of flexible maneuvers. Although excessive joint laxity is known to be associated with a variety of rheumatic conditions, TMJ disease has not been recognized as one of them. No patient in this series had a systemic inflammatory disorder or any other apparent etiologic factor for TMJ disease. We suggest that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between generalized joint laxity and TMJ disease.\r"

There were 28 patients with cardiac arrest, 44 with major trauma, and 24 with severe medical problems. A total of 2,392 PcjO2 data points were collected in these patients. In patients with cardiac arrest, PcjO2 showed changes in physiological condition as early as or earlier than measurement of vital signs. Measurement of PcjO2 and the finding of a PcjO2 index (PcjO2/PaO2) less than .5 in normotensive multiple trauma patients allowed rapid detection of hemorrhagic hypovolemia. In critically ill medical patients, low values for PcjO2 were found with hypoxemia as well as in conditions associated with decreased cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery. These two conditions could be distinguished by measuring PaO2 and calculating the PcjO2 index; a PcjO2 index less than .5 was associated with diminished peripheral perfusion and cardiac output, and a PcjO2 index greater than .5 indicated hypoxemia without any compromise in cardiac output. In the group of critically ill surgical and medical patients included in this study, conjunctival oxygen monitoring provided clinically useful information not available from vital signs and permitted identification of physiological instability associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation as early as or earlier than conventional monitoring methods.\r"

The optimum stimulation sites were identified using hand-held, trans-chest stimulating electrodes. Thereafter, conducting adhesive electrodes 4 cm in diameter were placed over each of the optimal sites. The relationship between inspired volume and stimulus intensity was determined with the forelimbs restrained and unrestrained using an 800-msec burst of 60/sec stimuli with a pulse duration of 20 microseconds. Two optimum stimulation sites were identified, one in the anterior axillary region, and another just lateral to the xiphoid process. The maximum volume of inspired air was obtained when the stimulating electrodes were placed at the anterior axillary sites. With the forelimbs restrained or unrestrained, an increased stimulus intensity resulted in an inspired volume well in excess of the spontaneous tidal volume of the animal. These studies indicate that, with chest-surface electrodes at the optimal locations, electroventilation can produce inspired volumes greater than spontaneous tidal volume in anesthetized baboons. With electrodes in the xiphoid region a smaller maximum inspired volume was obtained because of the stimulation of expiratory (abdominal) muscles.\r"

This study was designed to examine and compare the effects of an iron chelator (deferoxamine) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) on brain lipid peroxidation and tissue ions after eight hours of reperfusion following a 15-minute cardiac arrest. This sampling time was chosen because other work with this model has shown severe ionic and ultrastructural derangement at this point. Twenty-three dogs were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane and divided into four groups. Six dogs were nonischemic controls (group I). In the remaining dogs, a 15-minute cardiac arrest was induced with KCl. Resuscitation was begun with internal cardiac massage and artificial ventilation. After five minutes of artificial perfusion, internal defibrillation was performed to restart the heart. All dogs were resuscitated and supported by a standard intensive care (SIC) protocol for eight hours. Six resuscitated dogs served as SIC controls (group II). Six were treated with deferoxamine, 200 mg/kg loading dose and 100 mg/kg/h maintenance drip (group III), and five were treated with SOD, 1,000,000 units bolus and 500,000 units/h drip (group IV). All drugs were administered intravenously immediately postresuscitation. At eight hours postresuscitation, a 3-g portion of parietal cerebral cortex was obtained through a trephine hole. The sample was assayed for tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) by the thiobarbituric acid test, the double bond content of the tissue lipids (lipid unsaturation index, LUSI), and total tissue content of K and Na.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have advocated the use of mixed venous blood gases to estimate arterial pH and as a reflection of tissue acid-based balance. However, true mixed venous samples are difficult to obtain during cardiac arrest as they require a pulmonary artery catheter. The purpose of this study was to determine whether central or femoral venous samples could be used in place of pulmonary artery samples. Blood gases from these sites were drawn at intervals during experimental cardiac arrest in dogs. The PO2, PCO2, and pH from the pulmonary artery samples were strongly correlated with those from the central venous (r = .93, .99, and .99, respectively) and from the femoral venous samples (r = .73, .93, and .97, respectively). There were no significant differences in the pulmonary artery, central, or femoral venous gases. This animal model suggests that femoral and central venous samples mirror true mixed venous blood gases from the pulmonary artery and could be used in their place.\r"

Thirteen mongrels were made hypotensive by cooling to a core temperature of approximately 27 degrees C. Eight dogs had antishock trousers inflated for one hour and five dogs served as controls. Metabolic and hemodynamic variables were measured at regular intervals during cooling, during trouser inflation, and after trouser deflation. No study animal experienced ventricular fibrillation. Neither central temperature, pH, or serum potassium nor mean arterial BP or systemic vascular resistance were significantly affected by trouser inflation or deflation. Antishock trouser use during the early phase of hypothermia before rewarming does not appear to result in a central bolus of cold, acidotic, hyperkalemic blood or the precipitation of ventricular fibrillation. There appears to be no significant hemodynamic benefit of antishock trouser use early in the management of hypotension caused by moderate hypothermia.\r"

Forty-one of 46 patients (89%) experienced pain relief from nalbuphine, with maximum relief occurring within 15 minutes after the administration of the drug. Two addicted patients received no pain relief. There were no untoward side effects following nalbuphine administration, and the patients' heart rates, mean arterial pressures, and respiratory rates remained constant and stable throughout the study period. Repeated assessment of the patient by paramedics in the field was not impaired by nalbuphine treatment. In summary, nalbuphine hydrochloride is a useful and safe analgesic drug for IV use by paramedics in the prehospital setting.\r"

Representative volumes of three emergency medicine journals were reviewed for number and type of article, institutional origin, article length, and number of authors. For Annals of Emergency Medicine, (AEM) volumes for 1975, 1980, and 1985 were studied. For The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (AJEM) and The Journal of Emergency Medicine (JEM), articles from the first 12 months of publication (1983 to 1984) and the complete 1986 issue were examined. Analysis of the scientific sections of the journals discloses some interesting trends. While the average article length has remained about the same (four to six pages), the average number of authors per article has steadily risen. The percentage of articles listing an academic origin has remained steady in AEM and JEM, but has risen in AJEM. Multicenter collaborations and basic science articles are appearing with significantly increased frequency. A noteworthy trend is the rise in multiple authorship of articles. There have been significant p less than 10(-4] increases in the number of multiple-authored (more than three authors) articles in AEM and JEM. As reflected by the literature, scientific progress in EM is maintaining a rapid pace. However, there are increasing numbers of papers with multiple authors. Listing of multiple authors on papers has prompted criticism of the literature in other medical specialties. If this trend continues, there may be a risk of compromising the integrity of the published research.\r"

The TAMP is a 32-item, diagnosis-independent, criterion-referenced test that samples physical performance items in the areas of mobility, activities of daily living and physical aspects of communication. The administrative and scoring criteria of the TAMP are presented, and the multiple measurement dimensions are described. The documentation of patient status and progress, as described in the functional and performance profiles, is outlined. The paper also reports initial interobserver reliability on the intraitem tasks and the summary indexes of the two profiles. Forty individuals (20 adults and 20 children) with neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders comprised the reliability sample. Kappa and intraclass correlations were used to estimate the reliability of three independent raters on individual tasks and aggregate scores, respectively. Task reliability for the assistance and approach measurement dimensions were generally higher than for the more qualitative pattern and proficiency dimensions. Yet over 90% of all the tasks had acceptable reliability, while all the summary indexes had high interobserver reliability. Determination of interobserver reliability data is the initial phase of defining the most appropriate and technically valuable items, and will serve as a basis for item revision and reduction to enhance the clinical utility of the test.\r"

Significant improvement in test performance occurred across time to the degree and in a pattern similar to that noted in persons who have sustained mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. Hypothesized relationships between level and extent of SCI, etiology of injury and presence/absence of loss of consciousness and neuropsychologic test scores were not observed.

Other tests such as median-ulnar comparison using finger 4 were considered less reliable based primarily on the frequent association of carpal tunnel syndrome and Guyon canal entrapment. Carpal tunnel syndrome was confirmed in 49 of 52 suspected cases (94.2%) by at least one abnormal screening test. Bilateral involvement was noted in 65.3% of the cases (32 patients). The \"bactrian\" (two-hump camels) sign was the single most sensitive test used, being positive in 83.7% of cases.

Eleven patients (7%) suffered arrhythmic events during a mean (SD) of 12 (6) months of follow up (range 2-22, median 13 months). The combination of high gain, signal averaged electrocardiography and 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring was more accurate than either technique alone or than clinical information collected during admission in predicting these events. The combination identified a high risk group of 13 (8%) patients, with an arrhythmic event rate of 62% and a low risk group with an event rate of 2%. The combination of high gain, signal averaged electrocardiography and 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring in the first week after myocardial infarction provides a rapid, cheap, and non-invasive bedside method for the prediction of arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction based on measurements of area and length in a single oblique plane containing the long axis of the ventricle were compared with measurements made by summing the areas of the chamber in multiple contiguous slices. The multislice technique is known to be accurate, but the single slice technique is much quicker; it takes only nine minutes of acquisition time for both volume and ejection fraction. In 25 normal subjects there was good agreement between the two methods of measuring volume with a mean (SD) difference between measurements of 2.0 (6.6) ml. In 20 patients with previous infarction it was less good with a mean (SD) difference of 4.5 (18.1) ml. The mean (SD) difference of ejection fraction measurements was -0.019 (0.038) in the normal subjects and -0.059 (0.106) in the patients, and the discrepancy between the two techniques was greatest in the patients with a pronounced abnormality of wall motion and low ejection fraction. In a further 25 normal subjects, the agreement between single plane volume measurements in the vertical and horizontal long axis planes was good, indicating that either plane is suitable for rapid measurement. Single plane measurements of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction can be made with the accuracies stated, which are sufficient for routine clinical use except in patients with a pronounced abnormality of wall motion. In combination with measurements of regional wall thickness and motion, previously described, the technique offers a rapid non-invasive assessment of both global and regional left ventricular function.\r"

Sixteen (64%) of 25 patients who had sustained significant periods of cardiac arrest before operation died. The principal cause of death in this group was severe neurological damage. Five (11%) of the 46 who had not had a cardiac arrest died. The 50 (70%) patients who survived did so largely without morbidity during their hospital admission and in the follow up period. Most were not treated with long term anticoagulants and only two had another embolism. When a patient with acute massive pulmonary embolism is too ill to be given thrombolytic treatment, or when thrombolysis is either contraindicated or too slow in producing benefit, pulmonary embolectomy remains an effective alternative treatment with an acceptable mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypothyroidism on left ventricular function at rest and during exercise was studied in nine patients without demonstrable cardiovascular disease who had had total thyroidectomy and ablative radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer. Radionuclide ventriculography and simultaneous right heart catheterisation were performed while the patients were hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine treatment (to permit routine screening for metastases) and while they were euthyroid on thyroxine replacement treatment. When the patients were hypothyroid, cardiac output, stroke volume, and end diastolic volume at rest were all lower and peripheral resistance was higher than when they were euthyroid. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the systolic pressure:volume relation of the left ventricle, which was used as an estimate of the contractile state, were not significantly different when the patients were hypothyroid or euthyroid. During exercise, heart rate, cardiac output, end diastolic volume, and stroke volume were higher when the patients were euthyroid than when they were hypothyroid. Again, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, ejection fraction, and the systolic pressure:volume relation were similar in both thyroid states. The data suggest that the alterations in cardiac performance seen in short term hypothyroidism are primarily related to changes in loading conditions and exercise heart rate; they do not suggest that acute thyroid hormone deficiency has a major effect on the contractile properties of the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac sympathetic function was assessed by measuring the coronary sinus overflow of noradrenaline and dopamine at rest and during supine exercise in eight patients with high degree atrioventricular block treated with dual chamber pacemakers (DDD). Patients exercised (30-60 W) during both ventricular inhibited (VVI) and atrial synchronous (VAT) pacing. During exercise cardiac output increased less markedly in the VVI mode than in the VAT mode. The cardiac output response was entirely stroke volume dependent in the VVI mode and mainly heart rate dependent in the VAT mode. Coronary sinus noradrenaline concentrations were higher in the VVI mode at rest and during exercise. Noradrenaline overflow from the heart was enhanced during VVI pacing and increased from about 100 pmol/min (17 ng/min) at rest to 1087 pmol/min during exercise (60 W) in the VVI mode and 545 pmol/min in the VAT mode. Dopamine overflow from the heart was less than 5 pmol/at rest but increased 2-5 fold during exercise. Also arterial concentrations of catecholamine increased more during exercise in the VVI mode, but the differences between pacing modes were less pronounced. Circulating adrenaline seems to be of little importance for cardiac function under these conditions; in healthy individuals the arterial concentrations of adrenaline attained in this study have small effects. Cardiac noradrenaline overflow correlated with pulmonary capillary venous pressures and atrial rates in both pacing modes, indicating a relation between cardiac sympathetic activity and cardiac function. Enhanced cardiac release of noradrenaline may increase cardiac contractility and thereby partially compensate for the lack of heart rate responsiveness to exercise during VVI pacing.\r"

The ratios for the isthmus, the duct, and the right pulmonary artery were: 0.63 (0.11), 0.51 (0.13), 0.56 (0.10) respectively for the direct measurement and 0.73 (0.07), 0.7 (0.08), 0.62 (0.06) respectively at echocardiography. These results show that in mid-gestation the isthmus of the human fetus is not as small as that reported in animal models. This indicates that the distribution of the fetal circulation may not be the same either.\r"

The external and internal features that permitted the identification of the right and left appendages were studied in detail in one tenth of the hearts. These results were compared with a similar analysis of 25 normal hearts. This study showed that criteria for identification of right and left appendages were reliable. Application of these criteria to the overall collection identified the usual arrangement in 1776 (97%) hearts, a mirror image arrangement in eight (0.4%); left atrial isomerism in 22 (1.2%); and right atrial isomerism in 36 (1.9%). Fourteen (0.81%) had juxtaposed atrial appendages (13 with usual arrangement and one with left isomerism). This did not interfere with identification of the left and right atria on the basis of appendage morphology. In only two cases did the determination by atrial morphology produce a result that was inconsistent with the arrangement of the other thoracoabdominal organs. Further examination of the atria in these showed a mistake had been made in the initial assessment. The atrial arrangement can be accurately determined by the morphology of the atrial appendages.\r"

At dilatation the gradient across the aortic valve was reduced by greater than 30% in 69% of patients and the Gorlin valve area (calculated in 7/15 patients) increased by 30% in half. But a comparison of Doppler gradients measured before and one to two days after dilatation in 11 patients showed a greater than 30% reduction in the simultaneously measured gradient in only four. Doppler gradient was the most accurate predictor of symptomatic benefit and a fall in Doppler gradient persisted mainly in patients whose peak to peak gradient fell by at least 40% at the time of the procedure. Balloon dilatation of the aortic valve is a relatively safe procedure but it is less successful than previous reports suggest, perhaps because of early restenosis. Some forms of aortic stenosis may be more amenable to this procedure than others.\r"

Infusion of angiotensin II increased the end systolic pressure by a mean (SD) of 36.2 (10.3) mm Hg. As the afterload increased early diastolic dysfunction tended to become more normal: the interval and the change in dimension between minimal cavity dimension and mitral valve opening decreased and the duration of rapid diastolic filling and the accompanying change in dimension increased. None the less, the end diastolic dimension and thus the overall diastolic filling remained unchanged. Impaired early diastolic function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is at least partly caused by altered loading conditions.\r"

Twenty-seven major complications related to anaesthesia occurred during or within 24 h of the anaesthesia--an incidence of 0.7 per 1000 anaesthetics. Nine, of which four were associated with cardiac arrest, were observed in infants, whereas in children there were 18 complications of which eight were associated with cardiac arrest, one with fatal outcome. The risk of complications was significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in infants (4.3 per 1000) than in children (0.5 per 1000). Accidents observed in infants mainly occurred during maintenance of anaesthesia and were the result of respiratory failure. In children, circulatory failure was as frequent as respiratory failure and complications were observed almost equally during induction and maintenance and on recovery. The rate of complications increased significantly with the ASA score and the number of co-existing diseases. The incidence was also higher when a previous history of anaesthesia was present, when the procedure was an emergency, and when the duration of preoperative fasting was less than 8 h.\r"

Mean clearance was 512 ml kg-1 h-1 and mean elimination half-lives were 3.3 h following CPB, with a tendency to a higher clearance in those children who had not undergone bypass. In a subsequent part of the study, 10 children received an infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 h-1, in combination with intermittent doses of morphine, in the postoperative period. Mean plasma midazolam concentrations consistent with adequate sedation were 80-100 ng ml-1 during the infusion. One child who had not undergone CPB had very low plasma concentrations of midazolam with the same rate of infusion, consistent with the tendency for higher clearance in this group in the bolus pharmacokinetic study.\r"

Thirty patients aged between 20 and 50 yr received one of three solutions (groups I-III, respectively): 0.75% 10 ml (75 mg); 0.5% 15 ml (75 mg); 0.75% 15 ml (112.5 mg). A further 20 patients older than 50 yr received 0.75% bupivacaine 10 ml (group IV, n = 10) or 15 ml (group V, n = 10). The number of segments blocked at maximal extent of block was virtually the same in each group: group I (0.75% 10 ml) 13.3 (SD 1.4); group II (0.5% 15 ml) 14.1 (2.9); group III (0.75% 15 ml) 13.8 (2.2); group IV (0.75% 10 ml) 14.2 (2.1); group V (0.75% 15 ml) 16.7 (3.1). The larger dose of bupivacaine (112.5 mg) produced the fastest onset and longest duration of block. Onset and recovery intervals were similar with 0.75% and 0.5% solutions when administered at the same dose (75 mg in 10 ml or 15 ml). There was no correlation between the level of block and the age, weight and height of the patient. In patients who received 15-ml injections, there was a positive association between the upper level of block and body mass index.\r"

However, maximum fetal brain concentration was only 0.27-0.86 of maternal. Concentrations increased with time in amniotic fluid, but did not exceed those in maternal plasma. Although there was some accumulation of bupivacaine in rabbit fetuses, tissue uptake could not account for low F:M ratios persisting beyond 80 min.\r"

Both UVB and PUVA treatment caused a profound inhibition of trauma- and LTB4-induced PMN accumulation. This observation indicates that reduction of the transepidermal migration of PMN might be part of the mechanism of action of UV therapies in psoriasis. Several possibilities are discussed to explain this hypothesis.\r"

In psoriasis, plasma LF levels were significantly increased compared with levels in the other skin conditions and in the healthy controls (P less than 0.01).

Keratinocyte proliferation and its sensitivity to calmodulin antagonists was compared with that of normal human dermal fibroblasts and neoplastic mouse B16 melanoma cells. Keratinocytes were similar to fibroblasts in showing reduced proliferation in low (0.15 mM) calcium medium and unlike B16 cells which continued to proliferate until calcium was reduced to submicromolar levels. Intracellular calmodulin was significantly higher in rapidly dividing keratinocytes in normal (1.15 mM) calcium medium than in slower dividing cells in low (0.15 mM) calcium. Fibroblasts and B16 cells maintained similar calmodulin levels in both low and normal calcium media. Calmodulin antagonists inhibited proliferation of all three cell types equally. Thus, keratinocyte calmodulin seems related to the proliferative state of the cell (unlike fibroblast calmodulin) and calmodulin antagonists may be of use in controlling the hyperproliferation of the psoriatic epidermis.\r"

Percutaneous absorption of hexyl nicotinate was monitored non-invasively by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) following each of three randomly assigned pre-treatments: untreated control, 30 min occlusion with a polypropylene chamber and 30 min occlusion followed by exposure to ambient conditions for 1 h. Stratum corneum water content after the same pre-treatments was measured with the dielectric probe technique. The local vasodilatory effect of the nicotinic acid ester was quantified using LDV by the onset of increased blood flow, the time of maximal increase in response, the magnitude of the peak response and the area under the response-time curve. Each of these parameters was significantly different, immediately following occlusion, from the untreated control values. However, if the occluded site was exposed for 1 h prior to hexyl nicotinate application these parameters did not differ significantly from the controls. Stratum corneum water content (expressed as a percentage of a maximal value) showed the same behaviour: the pre-treatment control value was 31.8 +/- 4.8%; after 30 min occlusion, this had risen to 46.9 +/- 6.2%; 1 h later, the reading had returned to 32.1 +/- 6.2%. There was a significant correlation between stratum corneum water content and area under the LDV response-time curve. It appears, therefore, that this method may be useful for quantifying the relationship between increased stratum corneum hydration and enhanced percutaneous absorption in vivo in man.\r"

Patients treated with etretinate had elevated natural killer cell activity and a significant elevation of natural killer cell numbers at 12 weeks. Other tests which were performed and showed no significant change at 6 or 12 weeks compared with starting levels included lymphocyte transformation in response to phytohaemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen and concanavalin A, total numbers of circulating T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and T helper and T suppressor subsets, numbers of epidermal Langerhans cells and serum levels of IgA, IgM and IgE. In view of the involvement of natural killer cells in the initial phase of organ rejection, these results suggest that isotretinoin is the safer of the two retinoids if administration to renal transplant recipients is considered, particularly in the immediate post-transplant period.\r"

In contrast, nine normal liver biopsies and two biopsies with minimal fibrosis were found among the 15 patients with normal serum levels of PIII NP. The study indicates that aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen can be utilized as a valuable non-invasive marker of fibrogenesis in the liver.

However, analysis of the intestinal absorption profile yielded no significant difference between the two groups.

The ratio of the mean thickness of abnormal to normal stratum corneum (for the same skin region) is suggested as an objective measure of hyperkeratosis; likewise, the ratio of abnormal to normal stratum malpighii is an objective measure of acanthosis. A single parameter can be measured against time to follow changes during the pathogenesis, treatment or remission of epidermal disease. As psoriasis undergoes progressive acanthosis, the geometry of the folding of the dermo-epidermal junction is such that cells of the stratum malpighii retain their close association with the cylindrical dermal papillae.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained from an age-matched control group of healthy women. The incidence of women with signs of androgenization in the two groups did not differ significantly. The only significant differences found were a shorter menstrual cycle and a longer duration of menstrual flow in the women suffering from hidradenitis, and that women with hidradenitis were more likely to have a positive family history of hidradenitis. The prevalence of hidradenitis in the control group was 4%. The results show that hidradenitis is not accompanied by other signs of androgenization. The disease may be due to local changes in the apocrine glands of predisposed individuals.\r"

At the application site there were higher concentrations of the PG formulation at the deeper levels of the SC. At the adjacent sites there were higher concentrations of the BA formulation at the superficial levels. The mean radioactivity at the adjacent sites expressed as a percentage of that at the corresponding application sites (+/- SEM) was 7.8 +/- 5.3% for the BA formulation and 3.0 +/- 2.9% for the PG, (P = 0.0002). Total percentage of the applied dose in the skin adjacent to the application site was 11.7 +/- 6.3% for the BA formulation and 5.3 +/- 5.7% for the PG (P less than 0.0002). Clobetasol 17-propionate, therefore, moves laterally to a greater extent in BA than in PG.\r"

  ".W": "At present the reported use of itraconazole, a new oral triazole antifungal, has been confined to short-term treatments. This investigation is an appraisal of itraconazole in the treatment of three different forms of onychomycosis. Six patients with nail infections due to Candida albicans not associated with paronychia affecting a total of 20 nails received itraconazole (100 mg daily) for a mean period of 5.9 months. Complete remission was achieved in all cases. Twenty six patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis affecting a total of 45 finger and 80 toe-nails were treated with itraconazole (100-200 mg daily). In 24 cases the causative organism was Trichophyton rubrum. Remission was achieved in 64% of finger and 73% of toe-nails in 5 and 9.4 months, respectively. Treatment failures were experienced in patients with finger-nail infections due to T. violaceum (I) and those concurrently receiving phenytoin and phenobarbitone (3). Three patients with infections due to Hendersonula toruloidea failed to respond to treatment. Adverse effects were experienced by four patients (abdominal discomfort 3, diarrhoea I), but none were serious enough to lead to abandonment of treatment. No persistent changes were seen in serum biochemical values. This study suggests that itraconazole is potentially effective in the long-term treatment of superficial fungal infections such as onychomycosis, and comparative studies with alternatives such as griseofulvin should now be carried out.\r"

The average recovery time in patients with glaucoma was 70.47 (SD 35.39) seconds. The average recovery time in the control population was 41.97 (SD 17.34) seconds. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). There was a small positive correlation between age and recovery time in the control population, whereas there was no correlation between age and recovery time in the glaucoma group. There was no correlation between visual acuity and recovery time for either group. There was also no correlation between intraocular pressure and recovery time for the glaucoma group. It was not possible to control for pupillary dilatation in this study. However, it has been previously demonstrated that pharmacological meiosis will not delay photostress recovery time in normal subjects. This is the first report of photostress recovery testing in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma. The results are discussed in terms of the pathophysiology of glaucoma and previous photostress studies in patients with macular disease.\r"

All were Caucasian, and the series consisted of 47 men and 55 women, with a mean age of 52.5 years. The major findings in this rare disorder concern the ocular fundus. Most marked are the patterned distribution of depigmented spots without hyperpigmentation, radiation from the optic disc in association with vitritis, retinal vasculopathy with frequent cystoid macular oedema, and involvement of the optic nerve head. The distribution and appearance of the lesions suggest that they are related to the major choroidal veins. Complications of the disease were epiretinal membranes, retinal neovascularisation, recurrent vitreous haemorrhage, subretinal neovascular membranes occurring both in the juxtapapillary and macular regions, and optic atrophy. The medical history was not contributary. HLA testing showed very strong disease association with HLA A29 (95.8%). The evidence suggests that it is a single disease entity rather than a group of disorders because of the remarkable similarity in the ophthalmological appearance and the clinical course, combined with the exceptionally high association with HLA A29.\r"

To elucidate the process of capillary obstruction we examined macular capillaries in 104 diabetics, using fluorescein angiography. The follow-up period was three to eight years. We found that some capillaries in the macular were obstructed, then became unobstructed. Reflow of blood into the macula after the obstruction was observed in nine patients (8.7%). The time between obstruction and reflow varied from two months to four years. There were four cases of simple, three of preproliferative, and two of proliferative retinopathy. Reflow in the capillaries was confirmed as occurring at the same position and in vessels with the same diameter as seen before the obstruction. There was no leakage of the fluorescein dye from the capillary where reflow took place. We tentatively conclude that one of the causes of this phenomenon is a functional obstruction.\r"

Significant correlation of several CT parameters of the mid-orbital axial CT slice with optic nerve involvement was established. By means of clinical measures, only limitation of ocular motility was found to correlate with the optic neuropathy. The results suggested that there were two distinct populations of patients with Graves' disease which could be segregated by CT scan and clinical evaluation, one which developed optic neuropathy and one which did not. Therefore simple measures performed on the mid-orbital slice of the CT scan are recommended for all patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy as an important adjunct to careful evaluation of extraocular muscle function, in order to identify patients at risk of developing optic neuropathy.\r"

Concentrations of 5-fluorouracil were assayed at 10 time intervals from 0.5 to 96 hours in cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva and at six time intervals from 0.5 to 12 hours in aqueous. Two peak concentrations were noted at approximately one and eight hours, with measurable levels present at 96 hours.

The intraosseous, extradural non-encapsulated, and friable tumour contained cytoplasmic factor VIII-related antigen. After complete removal of the tumour the patient has been well for 10 months of the follow-up period. This case brings the total number of reported primary angiosarcomas of the cranium to nine. All patients were male and most of them were young. The average age was 24 years. The frontal bone seems to be the site of predilection for cranial angiosarcomas. Surgical extirpation, radiation, or combined surgical removal and radiation have been used for treating angiosarcoma of the skull with variable results. It is suggested that angiosarcoma of the skull has a worse prognosis than angiosarcoma of bones other than the cranium because the patient may die of secondary neoplastic involvement of the brain.\r"

  ".W": "A series of bidentate hydroxypyridinone iron chelators that have therapeutic potential as oral iron chelators, have been studied systematically to determine which properties are the most critical for the mobilization of hepatocyte iron. The relationship between lipid solubility of the free and complexed forms of each chelator and hepatocyte iron release has been investigated as well as the contribution of the binding constant for iron (III). Hydroxypyridin-4-ones that were approximately equally soluble in lipid and aqueous phases were the most active compounds, the partition coefficient of the free chelator appearing to be more critical in determining iron release than that of the iron-complexed form. Highly hydrophilic chelators did not mobilize intracellular iron pools, whereas highly lipophilic compounds were toxic to hepatocytes. The contribution of the binding constant for iron (III) to cellular iron release was assessed by comparing hydroxypyridin-4-ones (log beta 3 = 36) and hydroxypyridin-2-ones (log beta 3 = 32), which possess similar partition coefficients. The results show that the binding for iron (III) is particularly important at low concentrations of chelator (less than 100 mumol/L) and that at higher concentrations (greater than 500 mumol/L) iron mobilization is limited by the available chelatable pool. Measurement of iron release with other chelators confirms the importance of both the lipid solubilities and iron (III)-binding constants to iron mobilization. The most active hydroxypyridin-4-ones released more hepatocyte iron than did deferoxamine when compared at equimolar concentrations. The results suggest that the ability of an iron chelator to enter the cell is crucial for effective iron mobilization and that once within the cell the binding constant of the chelator for iron (III) becomes a dominant factor.\r"

  ".U": "89027076\r", 
  ".W": "Antithrombin-III-Hamilton is a structural mutant of antithrombin III with defective serine protease reactivity, demonstrable in three members of a French Canadian family. The propositus, a 54-year-old man with a history of recurrent thromboembolic events, and his two asymptomatic grown children are heterozygous for the mutant antithrombin III gene. In all three individuals, the immunoreactive antithrombin III level is normal, while the antithrombin and antifactor Xa activity is approximately 50% of the control value. Two dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of antithrombin-III-Hamilton in the presence of heparin is normal. Purified antithrombin-III-Hamilton did not form thrombin-antithrombin III complex when incubated with thrombin for up to 30 minutes. The normal and mutant antithrombin III alleles of the propositus could be distinguished by linkage to Pstl restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). Genomic DNA from the propositus was cloned into EMBL 3 phage vectors and two clones containing nearly complete copies of the antithrombin-III-Hamilton allele were identified. Exon 6 of both clones was subcloned into M13 phage vector and sequenced, revealing a G----A point mutation in the first base of codon 382. Codon 382 codes for alanine in the normal allele and for threonine in the antithrombin-III-Hamilton allele. Alanine-382, 12 residues from the reactive center, is a highly conserved amino acid in the family of serine protease inhibitors known as the serpins. We postulate that, as a result of the substitution of threonine for alanine in antithrombin-III-Hamilton, either the tertiary structure or the hydrophobicity of the thrombin-binding region is altered, causing aberrant conformation of the Arg-393-Ser-394 bond at the reactive center impairing the interaction between antithrombin-III-Hamilton and the activated serine proteases.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we used a fluorescent flow cytometry-based assay to examine plasminogen binding to platelets in plasma. Our data indicate that platelets activated in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) by adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) or thrombin bind plasminogen to their surface. Fab fragments of the monoclonal antibody LJ-CP8 that are directed against the fibrinogen binding site on the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex inhibit both plasminogen and fibrinogen binding to ADP-stimulated platelets as does 5 mmol/L EDTA. Platelet aggregation and plasminogen and fibrinogen binding are also concurrently inhibited by the Gly-Arg-Asp (RGD) analogue Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) when it is added to PRP before ADP stimulation. The scrambled peptide analogue SDGRG has no effect. The monoclonal antibody 6D1, directed against the von Willebrand factor binding site on GPIb, has no effect on plasminogen-platelet binding, nor does antithrombospondin antibody. epsilon-Aminocaproic acid (EACA), however, inhibits plasminogen binding to ADP-activated platelets. These data indicate that plasminogen binds to platelets activated in plasma, that binding occurs on platelet GPIIb/IIIa, and that binding may be mediated via plasminogen association with fibrinogen via lysine binding domains. Finally, we found both plasminogen and fibrinogen on resting platelets in PRP and demonstrated that they are equally displaced by EDTA, LJ-CP8, and 10E5 (an additional anti-GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody). Plasminogen is also equally displaced by EACA. These data suggest that plasminogen is also bound to GPIIb/IIIa on resting platelets, possibly also via interaction with fibrinogen.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model of hemoglobin switching has been developed in which anemic adult chickens are treated with 5-azacytidine and sodium butyrate or alpha-aminobutyric acid, thereby resulting in activation of the embryonic rho-globin gene in adult erythroid cells. In vitro nuclear runoff transcription assays using erythroid nuclei from treated birds show that the mechanism of activation of the rho-globin gene is transcriptional whereas no transcriptional activation of the embryonic epsilon-globin gene occurs. The action of 5-azacytidine appears to be as an inhibitor of DNA methylation because other S-phase active cytotoxic drugs, when substituted for 5-azacytidine, do not cause demethylation of the embryonic globin genes, nor do they allow transcriptional activation to occur. Embryonic rho-globin gene activation in this model is not due to selection of primitive erythroid cells since a subpopulation of primitive erythroid cells is not evident either morphologically or when cells are probed for embryonic and adult globin RNA by in situ hybridization. These studies show that demethylation by 5-azacytidine is a prerequisite but not sufficient cis-regulatory event for a high level of transcriptional activation of the embryonic rho-globin gene in adult erythroid cells in vivo. The possible basis for the selective transcriptional activation by sodium butyrate in this system is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89027089\r", 
  ".W": "Reported findings of elevated total calcium (Ca) contents in erythrocytes (RBCs) from patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia (beta-TI) prompted the question of whether the state and transport of Ca in these RBCs are similar to those in sickle cell anemia (SS) RBCs where the increased Ca is compartmentalized in endocytic inside-out vesicles and extracted by exposure of the cells to the Ca ionophore A23187 and a Ca chelator (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) and the levels of cytoplasmic free ionized Ca [( Ca2+]i) are normal. We confirmed a high total Ca content of 51 +/- 13 mumol/L RBCs in splenectomized (SPX) beta-TI and 24 +/- 1 mumol/L RBCs in non-SPX beta-TI. Unlike SS RBCs, however, most of the increased Ca was in the lighter, presumably younger beta-TI RBCs, and about half the Ca was not ionophore mobilizable but apparently firmly bound, possibly to remnants of organelles in nucleated and other young RBCs. In the denser RBCs from non-SPX beta-TI, total and extractable Ca amounts were normal. beta-TI RBCs loaded with the Ca chelator Benz 2 showed an initial influx of 45Ca in the normal range, which indicated normal Ca permeability, and near-steady-state levels of [Ca2+]i that were normal (22 +/- 7 nmol/L RBCs in non-SPX beta-TI) or minimally increased (40 +/- 19 nmol/L RBCs in SPX beta-TI). Serial-section electron microscopy of beta-TI ghosts from the denser cell fractions showed more fully enclosed vesicles in non-SPX ghosts than were seen in normal ghosts and many large vesicles and structured, electron-dense material in SPX ghosts. A delayed extrusion of ionophore-preloaded 45Ca only by the SPX beta-TI RBCs together with normal [Ca2+]i suggested compartmentalization of the loaded Ca in these RBCs, perhaps in endocytic inside-out vesicles, and normal Ca pumps. Since beta-TI RBCs show essentially normal levels of [Ca2+]i and normal Ca influx, their high total Ca content should not be associated with any of the deleterious effects observed in vitro with increased levels of [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "In hemophilia B, assays based on a monoclonal antifactor IX specific for the Thr-148 variant of an exonic polymorphism have diagnosed carriers in selected families by either establishing linkage or by indicating the presence or absence of a given normal factor IX. The sensitivity of the immunoassays for detecting heterozygous women was explored by comparing results from immunoassays with solid-phase polyclonal v the monoclonal antifactor IXs. Factor IX with the normal Ala-148 variant gave a flat dilution curve, qualitatively distinct from factor IX with the Thr-148 variant in the monoclonal assay. The two were indistinguishable in the polyclonal assay. Mixtures of equal amounts of the two types gave an intermediate result, about half as reactive in the monoclonal as compared with the polyclonal assay system. Whereas mixtures with 10% Ala-148 and 90% Thr-148 factor IXs could not readily be distinguished from Thr-148 factor IX plasma, as little as 1% of the Thr-148 protein was detected in Ala-148 factor IX plasma. The frequency of the Ala-148 variant varied in individuals with different ethnic backgrounds; it was found in 29% of white, 12% of black, and none of Asian blood donors' factor IX genes in Seattle. Only 4% of samples from South African black men were nonreactive (ie, Ala-148). The Thr/Ala-148 dimorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium with Taql restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Three recombinations were noted in normal white genes and one in a normal black factor IX gene (less than 2% of those examined). In 34 white families with at least one woman being a possible carrier, genetically, the immunoassay results were informative in 18. RFLP analyses were informative in eight of the 15 families tested. In five families each, assignment of carrier status was made to a woman by only DNA or only immunoassay results, whereas the other approach was noninformative. The immunoassays provide a rapid, inexpensive screening test and complement DNA analysis in white women who are potential carriers of hemophilia B.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma factor XIII is a complex of A and B proteins noncovalently linked in a tetramer, A2B2, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were developed to measure the separate factor XIII proteins and the complex. All of the A protein in plasma is in the zymogen complex. The B assay measures the total amount of B protein in plasma (both free B and complexed B). This was confirmed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, which showed two bands for B in plasma with this antibody. Two assays were developed to measure A2B2 complex specifically. One assay used a monoclonal antibody to B to bind antigen and measured B protein in the zymogen complex only and hence the concentration of the complex. The specificity of this antibody was also shown by immunoblotting. In the second assay, the capture antibody was to B and the tag antibody was to A. These two assays gave identical results for the concentration of A2B2 (0.07 mumol/L, 21.6 micrograms/mL in normal plasma). Thus, for the first time, differentiation and quantitation of free B and complexed B in plasma was possible. The assays were used to measure factor XIII proteins in plasma from normal controls, homozygous-deficient factor XIII patients, and their heterozygous relatives. The normal concentration of A in plasma is 0.13 to 0.16 mumol/L (approximately 11 micrograms/mL), all of which is in A2B2. The total B concentration is 0.26 to 0.28 mumol/L (approximately 21 micrograms/mL), half of which is complexed. The free B concentration is 0.13 mumol/L (approximately 10 micrograms/mL). Homozygous-deficient patients have essentially no A protein, but their free B concentration is 0.11 mumol/L. Heterozygotes have decreased A2B2, but their free B is 0.11 mumol/L. These results indicate that the concentration of free B is remarkably constant and does not depend on the concentration of A2 or A2B2.\r"

Consecutive mothers of healthy premature infants born at either St Joseph's Hospital or McMaster University Medical Centre in Hamilton were asked for consent. One hundred thirty-seven premature infants (30 to 36 weeks of gestational age) entered the study. The premature infants did not have any major health problems and did not require ventilation or supplemental oxygen. Demographic information and a 20-mL blood sample were obtained in the postnatal period on days 1, 5, 30, 90, and 180. Between 40 and 96 premature infants were studied on each day for each of the following tests: prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin clotting time, plasminogen; 13 factor assays [fibrinogen, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, high-mol-wt kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein (PK), von Willebrand factor (vWF)] and eight inhibitors [antithrombin III (AT-III), heparin cofactor II, alpha 2-antiplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, C1 esterase inhibitor, protein C (PC), and protein S (PS)]. A combination of biologic and immunologic assays were used. Between 30 to 36 weeks there was a minimal effect of gestational age for levels of AT-III, PC, and factors II and X only; therefore, the entire data set was used to generate reference ranges for these components of the coagulation system for premature infants. Next, the results for the premature infants were compared with those of a previously published study in 118 fullterm infants and with those for adults. An effect of gestational age was shown for plasminogen, fibrinogen, factors II, V, VIII, IX, XI, XII, HMWK, and all eight inhibitors. In general, the postnatal maturation towards adult levels was accelerated in premature infants as compared with the fullterm infants. By 6 months of age, most components of the coagulation system in premature infants had achieved near adult values.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal RBCs can undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis; normal adult RBCs cannot. Previously, we showed that drug-induced endocytosis, which can occur in adult RBCs exposed to amphipathic cations like primaquine, is greatly enhanced in all density-defined fractions of neonatal RBCs. To investigate the similarities and differences between receptor-mediated endocytosis and drug-induced endocytosis, we characterized transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis in neonatal RBCs and compared it with drug-induced endocytosis. Primaquine drug-induced endocytosis is dependent on RBC ATP levels, is invariably preceded by stomatocytosis, and is inhibited by vanadate. In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin is not preceded by stomatocytosis, is not nearly so dependent on ATP levels as is drug-induced endocytosis, and is not inhibited by vanadate. Furthermore, receptor-mediated endocytosis is quantitatively blocked by preincubation of neonatal RBCs with sodium cyanide, whereas cyanide does not inhibit drug-induced endocytosis in either adult or neonatal RBCs. Morphologic observation of the neonatal RBCs established the fact that only puckered RBCs that exhibited brilliant cresyl blue staining reticulum were capable of undergoing receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin. These characteristics identify them as motile R-1 reticulocytes. Reticulocytes in normal adult RBCs were incapable of exhibiting this phenomenon. Thus, receptor-mediated endocytosis, a property of motile reticulocytes in neonatal RBCs, differs from drug-induced endocytosis in its energy requirements, response to inhibitors, and morphologic concomitants.\r"

  ".W": "Aggregation responses and thromboxane (Tx) formation in ten patients with storage pool deficiency (SPD) specific to the dense granules (delta-SPD) were studied to assess further the role of dense granule adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in mediating platelet aggregation by epinephrine. The ability of epinephrine to elicit secondary aggregation (SA) responses was highly variable in delta-SPD when tested at 5 mumol/L epinephrine, but was consistently abnormal when tested over a range of concentrations. The occurrence of SA in both delta-SPD patients and normal subjects was correlated with the magnitude of the rate of primary aggregation (PA). This PA rate was normal, on average, for the entire patient group but was greater in patients with more consistent SA responses. The PA findings were related to the Kd value obtained in binding studies with 3H-yohimbine, but not with the number of alpha 2-receptor sites. Studies on Tx production (assessed by radioimmunoassay of TxB2) showed that the ability to synthesize Tx from arachidonate was not impaired in delta-SPD, and that there was an absolute positive correlation between epinephrine-induced SA and Tx production. Aggregation in delta-SPD platelets in response to the Tx receptor agonist U44069 was consistently decreased, but could be corrected by addition of ADP. The results of the study suggest that dense granule-derived ADP is not required for PA by epinephrine, but mediates SA as a synergistic agonist with TxA2. This role of ADP in SA may be elucidated more precisely by further studies on platelet activation processes in delta-SPD.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and probed the mechanism of action of two naturally occurring antibodies (Baltimore and Winston-Salem) against factor XI (FXI), that developed in patients congenitally deficient in FXI after replacement therapy. Purification on immobilized protein A and neutralization with monospecific antibodies against IgG heavy and light chain subtypes indicated that both antibodies were of restricted heterogeneity. Both Winston-Salem (IgG3 kappa) and Baltimore (IgG1 kappa) completely inhibited FXI coagulant activity at titers of 200 and 8 Bethesda units, respectively. Immunoaffinity columns prepared from each antibody were able to bind the heavy but not the light chain of reduced and alkylated activated FXI (FXIa). The activation of purified FXI by activated bovine factor XII (FXIIa), a reaction independent of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), was not inhibited by either antibody. The active site on the FXIa light chain was unaffected by either patient's IgG, as measured by its amidolytic activity. In contrast, one antibody (Baltimore) or its Fab' blocked the surface-mediated proteolytic activation of FXI by human FXIIa in a concentration-dependent fashion by preventing its binding to HK, but had no effect on the rate of activation of FIX by FXIa. In contrast, the other antibody (Winston-Salem) or its Fab' inhibited the activation of FIX by FXIa in a concentration-dependent fashion but did not inhibit binding of FXI to HK. We conclude that each of these two naturally occurring antibodies is directed against a specific, separate, and distinct epitope located in the heavy chain of FXIa, one near or at the domain essential for the activation of FIX by FXIa and the other close to the domain required for binding to HK.\r"

  ".W": "A DNA fragment containing the deletion junction region from a Japanese individual with homozygous delta beta-thalassemia has been cloned. A clone containing the normal DNA surrounding the 3' breakpoint of this deletion and a clone carrying the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of this patient were also isolated. Sequences of the deletion junction and both gamma-globin genes were determined. A comparison of these sequences with previously determined sequences of the normal counterparts revealed that the 5' breakpoint is located between 2,134 and 2,137 base pairs (bp) 3' to the polyA site of the A gamma-globin gene, the 5' breakpoint is located just downstream of the 3' border of the fetal gamma-globin duplication unit, and no molecular defects are evident within the gamma-globin gene region. A comparison between the sequences of the normal DNA surrounding the 3' breakpoint and the normal DNA surrounding the 5' breakpoint shows that deletion is the result of a nonhomologous recombination event. There are A+T-rich stretches near the 5' and 3' breakpoints in the normal DNA, and a portion of an Aly repeat is located in the region 3' to the 3' breakpoint. Southern blot analysis using probes 3' to the beta-globin gene showed that the deletion extends in the 3' direction further than any other deletions associated with delta beta-thalassemia and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) heretofore reported. These results are discussed in terms of the mechanism generating large deletions in mammalian cells and three models for the regulation of gamma-globin and beta-globin gene expression in humans.\r"

Examination of the genetic code and the sequence of normal antithrombin III revealed that these amino acid substitutions could arise from the substitution of either two nucleotides or a single nucleotide at codon 393 of the antithrombin III gene. In two families, detection of the ATIII variants by genetic linkage analysis was not possible owing to lack of informative RFLP markers. Consequently, we synthesized two 22-base-long oligonucleotides specific for the single-base substitutions in the region of codon 393 and demonstrated by oligonucleotide hybridization that the molecular defect of ATIII Northwick Park is caused by the CGT----TGT mutation at codon 393 and that ATIII Glasgow is caused by the CGT----CAT mutation at codon 393. These oligonucleotide probes should prove useful as an alternative method for early detection of the ATIII variants.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia (Ph) translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) occurs frequently in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but is less common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In most cases of CML and some cases of Ph+ ALL the protooncogene ABL from 9q34 is translocated to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the BCR gene at 22q11 to form a chimeric gene encoding a novel 210-kd protein (P210 BCR-ABL) with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. In other patients with Ph+ ALL and Ph+ AML, the breakpoint probably occurs in the first intron of the BCR gene; this results in a smaller chimeric gene which encodes a P190 BCR-ABL. We studied a patient with AML (FAB M6) arising de novo who had a \"masked\" Ph chromosome in association with extensive karyotypic changes. The leukemic cells initially showed rearrangement of the bcr, presence of a hybrid mRNA, and expression of the P210 BCR-ABL. These changes were absent in remission. These results support the concept that the BCR-ABL chimeric gene plays a crucial role in leukemogenesis but suggest that factors other than the position of the breakpoint in the BCR gene determine the lineage of the target cell for malignant transformation.\r"

  ".W": "Glanzmann thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive disorder of the platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa. These glycoproteins normally serve as receptors for other adhesive glycoproteins, including fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin. Most patients affected by Glanzmann thrombasthenia have low levels of GPIIb and GPIIIa; however, the separate mechanisms responsible for the deficiency in each remain to be determined. cDNA clones coding for the GPIIb and GPIIIa have been recently isolated, and their corresponding genomic sequences have been colocalized to the long arm of chromosome 17. Since a deletional event involving one or both of these structural genes could explain the disease phenotype, we have studied the DNA of two previously well-characterized cohorts of Glanzmann thrombasthenia patients from Israel. We performed Southern analysis with near full-length cDNA probes on genomic DNA obtained from 20 individuals. Four restriction enzyme digests were completed on each DNA sample. The similarity of banding patterns among probands, family members, and controls indicated that there were no major insertions or deletions in either the GPIIb or GPIIIa genes. Thus, the genetic defect in these patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia is most likely due to either a small change in the nucleotide sequence of the coding region or a defect in the regulatory region of one or both genes.\r"

A study was therefore carried out examining the relation between subtypes of human papillomavirus and local immunocompetent cells in the cervix. Colposcopically directed punch biopsy specimens were taken from normal cervix and from histologically proved cervical intraepithelial neoplasia for immunohistochemical studies. Human papillomavirus genome probing was performed on the abnormal specimens. A relation was apparent between decreased Langerhans' cells and moderate to high copy numbers of human papillomavirus type 16. The reduction in Langerhans' cells was significant for human papillomavirus type 18 even at low copy numbers. Conversely, the absence of human papillomavirus was associated with increased numbers of Langerhans' cells in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These findings suggest that the proposed oncogenic potential of human papillomavirus type 16 and human papillomavirus type 18 in particular may be mediated by a specific effect on the afferent limb of the immune response.\r"

The present study addressed both of these issues using an interactive computer modelling process. Long term savings were calculated at 900 deaths a year in England and Wales--that is, about 8% of the total deaths from breast cancer--and 9% of life years currently lost. The cost of each death saved from breast cancer was estimated at 39,000 pounds.\r"

The patients were not treated and were followed up for 12 to 29 months (mean 21.6 months), during which period none developed symptoms that could be attributed to E histolytica. Spontaneous loss of the parasite occurred in 17 patients, some of whom later became reinfected. Sixteen patients had antibody to human immunodeficiency virus, and infection with E histolytica showed the same benign course in them as in the patients who did not have antibody. Throughout the study classification of the isolates of E histolytica consistently showed that they belonged only to non-pathogenic zymodemes. The findings provide further evidence that E histolytica in homosexual men is a commensal organism.\r"

A significant increase in mortality from leukaemia among cigarette smokers (relative risk 1.53) was found, together with a dose-response relation with amount smoked (trend p less than 0.001). The relation was strongest (relative risk 1.72) for monocytic and chronic and unspecified myeloid leukaemias (ICD (7th revision) codes 204.1 and 204.2). For these leukaemias the increase was almost twofold (relative risk 1.93) among current smokers of over 20 cigarettes daily. Ex-cigarette smokers also showed an increase of leukaemia (relative risk 1.39; p less than 0.001). These findings are consistent with other studies and relevant to the interpretation of minor increases of leukaemia both in population and in individual based studies. If causal they also imply that smoking is responsible for many more deaths from leukaemia in adults than all other known causes combined.\r"

Use of the graphical aid was demonstrated to a group of 18 medical students, residents, fellows, and faculty in a 15 minute session. Evaluation of the trainees' application of the aid showed a small average bias of -0.0003 and an average variance of 0.006.

SASP exhibited a significant degree of suppression, at doses in the range 25-100 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01), this suppression being greater than 50% at 50 micrograms/ml. SP exhibited only a minor degree of suppression (10% at 75 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.01). Coadministration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin, produced no evidence of further suppression in the presence of SASP or SP. Administration of SP plus 5-ASA to parallel cultures that were profoundly suppressed by the molecular equivalent amount of SASP resulted in no suppression. This implied requirement of the intact parent molecule (SASP) to produce this effect, at these concentrations. The concentration of SASP required to produce more than 50% suppression was higher than that ever attained in the peripheral blood of humans receiving therapeutic doses of the drug. Human lymphocytes are similarly suppressed by SASP, but only at higher concentrations than are required for murine cells. Thus, if the parent drug is the active moiety and requires these concentrations to be effective in vivo, it follows that the site where these effects may be mediated is likely to be the intestinal tract. The effects described would suggest the gut associated lymphoid tissue as a likely target.\r"

  ".W": "A detailed physical and psychiatric assessment of 80 patients with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis was performed using diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder appropriate for those with physical illness. Seventeen (21%) patients had depression or anxiety severe enough to warrant treatment. The presence of pychiatric disorders was not related to the duration of the arthritis nor to 11 other indicators of its severity with the exception of grip strength (p less than 0.002) and Fries Functional grade (p less than 0.005). It was significantly related to the presence of social stress (p less than 0.05) and lack of social support (p less than 0.005). Those with psychiatric symptoms scored higher on an illness behaviour scale, indicating that they perceived their illness as very severe. These also worried excessively about it and failed to be reassured by the doctor. Such illness behaviour was displayed by some patients who had severe arthritis but lacked social support. In others the complaints were unfounded because their arthritis was mild. They also experienced much social stress and lacked social support. We conclude that psychiatric illness occurs in rheumatoid arthritis with similar frequency to that of other general medical patients. It is principally related to social stress and lack of support rather than severity of arthritis, and may lead to abnormal illness behaviour. Since lack of social support appears of prime importance in determining disability, its assessment is essential for the rehabilitation of the disabled patient with RA.\r"

The last mentioned was used in parallel with the new index to study 50 early RA patients. These were followed every 3-6 months for 1 year. Both indices seemed to fluctuate with changes in the patient's state.\r"

Identifying joint inflammation by the simultaneous presence of tenderness and swelling and weighting for joint size produced the most sensitive indices. Identifying inflamed joints by swelling alone, or swelling and/or tenderness, grading for the severity of the signs, or selecting a restricted range of joints provided no advantages.\r"

In addition low-dose phenobarbitone was included in the penicillamine formulation as a pharmacological indicator of compliance. Using these techniques incomplete compliance was apparent in 11 patients (42%). All such patients were identified by the pharmacological marker. Only one admitted poor compliance at interview and only six returned more than a few tablets too many. The reason for the high incidence of poor compliance in this selected group is not apparent but it may represent a significant cause of failure with D-penicillamine therapy. The use of low-dose phenobarbitone may have wider applications in the investigation of patients with other conditions who fail to respond adequately to treatment.\r"

This review of 137 patients treated conservatively found active tendinitis in 35 individuals at a mean of 19 months after presentation. In addition, 40 patients had residual pain and eight developed pain due to another cause. Early presentation and a history of overuse unrelated to occupation distinguished the 54 who had resolved from those with active tendinitis (p less than 0.01). Dominant arm involvement was associated with a poorer prognosis (p less than 0.05). Functional impairment occurred in 29 patients, two having lost employment. The sizeable proportion of patients with chronic tendinitis resistant to conservative treatment suggests that rotator cuff tendinitis is not an early self-limiting condition and improvement in management is required.\r"

Osteitis pubis occurred in seven cases of varied duration and severity of disease. Hip involvement (grade 2-4) occurred in 19%. Their mean age of onset (19.6 years) was younger than for those with normal hips (25.1 years; p = 0.003). Lone sacroiliitis (grade 3 and 4) without ascending spinal disease occurred in 11 patients. The mean age at onset for those with lone sacroiliitis and marked spinal disease was similar (23.3 and 24.9 years respectively; NS). By contrast, disease duration was 13.3 and 28.4 years respectively (p = 0.0007). Five patients (three women) had severe pelvic and cervical spine disease with normal lumbar spine. In conclusion: 1. Osteitis pubis occurs as an unusual, random event. 2. Hip involvement is an expression of young age at onset. 3. Lone sacroiliitis is uncommon and progression to ascending spinal disease is primarily a function of disease duration. 4. Skip lesions occur rarely and particularly in women. 5. Sacroiliitis and ascending spinal disease are part of the same spectrum.\r"

Multi-section spin-echo (SE) sequences of varying repetition (TR) and echo (TE) times were performed in the transverse and coronal planes with a section thickness of 10 mm. All acoustic neuromas displayed marked enhancement on the T1-weighted (short TR/TE) SE sequence post-Gd-DTPA. The intrameatal component was particularly well demonstrated compared with non-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images and contrast-enhanced CT. Identification of intrameatal tumour was difficult on T2-weighted SE images and one tumour was not identified on the T1-weighted SE sequence prior to Gd-DTPA. Four of five intrameatal tumours measuring less than 8 mm could only be demonstrated on CT by using CT air meatography. Extrameatal tumour extension was demonstrated on contrast-enhanced CT, although the assessment of brain-stem involvement and displacement was not as clearly seen as on coronal MR images. In two patients with large acoustic neuromas and a cyst, the true relationship of the cyst to the tumour could only be identified on the post-Gd-DTPA scan. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-DTPA is a relatively quick, safe, well tolerated and effective method for the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma.\r"

Since it is an important functional end-point, a correlation between the X-ray dose applied and the average length of jejunal villi was investigated, with the possibility of using it as a radiobiological test system. Mice were given whole-body irradiation in the low- (4-7 Gy) or high-dose (9-12 Gy) range in a single fraction. Villus length was measured in arbitrary units from stained histological sections. It was found that villus length was affected by both the dose ranges used, but the effect observed in the low-dose range was not dose-related, whereas in the high-dose range there was a correlation between the radiation dose applied and the reduction in the average length of villi. Therefore, it is not suitable as an assay for low doses and for high doses there is already a test system (the microcolony survival assay) which is more practical and widely used. Factors which may influence villus length as well as the basic mechanisms involved are reviewed briefly. Experimental data presented indicate that the villus length may also be dependent on the number of crypts per jejunal circumference.\r"

  ".W": "Fine needle aspiration biopsy for cytological examination (FNAC) is becoming increasingly accepted as a means of tissue diagnosis in breast disease. This study examines the feasibility and accuracy of FNAC in 'immediate reporting' by a consultant cytopathologist in a busy breast clinic. Over a 2-year period, 884 cytology reports were analysed. An initial clinical report and subsequent final cytological diagnosis was made. Fine needle aspiration provided adequate material for cytological evaluation in 635 of the 884 biopsies (71.6 per cent) and this proportion was greater when discrete lumps were considered (463 of 562 biopsies = 82.4 per cent). In diffuse and cystic disease, however, the adequacy of specimens was reduced: 50 per cent and 65 per cent respectively. On immediate reporting the diagnostic sensitivity for all patients was 88 per cent (discrete lumps only, 92.5 per cent) and the specificity was 99.8 per cent (discrete lumps only, 100 per cent). FNAC retains its diagnostic accuracy when immediate reporting is employed and this study demonstrates that this technique can be used in making a diagnosis in patients with breast disease.\r"

There were 50 (1.6 per cent) in-hospital and 66 (2.1 per cent) late wound infections (overall 3.7 per cent). Fifty-four (1.8 per cent) patients developed postoperative intraperitoneal sepsis. Ninety-eight patients died (overall mortality 3.2 per cent) and intraperitoneal sepsis was a related factor in twelve (0.4 per cent). Wound infection, peritoneal sepsis and mortality were related to the degree of operative contamination and to reoperation. The results support the traditional, although sometimes inadequately stressed, teaching that technique is an important factor in preventing infection. Infection is also reduced by peroperative antibiotic lavage. The limited value and the potential difficulties of the unstructured introduction of computerized audit should be recognized.\r"

Four patients (1.6 per cent) required a drainage procedure for gastric stasis. The first 66 patients (Group A) were followed prospectively and 58 were available for assessment at 5 years. Eight patients (14 per cent) had developed a recurrent ulcer. In seven of these patients this responded to conservative treatment with H2 receptor antagonists. One patient has required Polya partial gastrectomy for recurrent ulceration. At 5 years 47 patients (81 per cent) were placed in the Visick I or II categories. In the next 175 patients (Group B), the ulcer recurrence rate was 3 per cent, suggesting a learning curve in mastering the procedure. We conclude that the immediate and 5-year results of the first 66 patients are at least comparable with those of highly selective vagotomy. Anterior gastric seromyotomy with posterior truncal vagotomy is an easy and rapid procedure and may be more widely applicable than highly selective vagotomy.\r"

Certain factors were examined to try to elucidate those influencing recurrence rate but no significant prognostic indicator was found. Acid studies were analysed and no significant relationship between these and the development of a recurrence could be found. The second 100 vagotomies were better than the first as judged by the results of studies of insulin-stimulated acid. Finally, we question whether all recurrences should automatically be regarded as treatment failures and the patients classified as Visick IV.\r"

The indication for radiotherapy was benign disease in nine and papillary thyroid carcinoma in one case. The mean interval between radiation exposure and the detection of HPT was 32 years (range 3-63 years). Patients treated with radioactive iodine alone developed HPT after a mean of 5 years while the interval for those treated with external beam therapy alone was a mean of 44 years. The parathyroid histology was adenoma in six cases, carcinoma in three cases and nodular hyperplasia in one case. All patients had coincident benign thyroid disease apart from one that had previously had papillary carcinoma and another with follicular carcinoma. Neck irradiation has been shown to confer an increased risk of HPT due to parathyroid adenoma and carcinoma. Radiotherapy for benign disease has generally been abandoned and these cases demonstrate a further contra-indication for the use of neck irradiation.\r"

The 12 women and 8 men (mean age 61.7 +/- 2.8 (s.e.m.) years) underwent a full nutritional assessment before measurement of their REE by indirect calorimetry using the MGM II metabolic cart (Utah Medical). Their REE was estimated by the Harris-Benedict formula (mean 1324 +/- 53 (s.e.m.) kcal/day) as well as an empirical formula (where empirical formula = 22 x body weight in kg) (1370 +/- 68 (s.e.m.) kcal/day). Results by either estimate were not statistically different from the measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) (1382 +/- 130 (s.e.m.) kcal/day), by one-way analysis of variance. No multiplication factors were needed to relate the Harris-Benedict formula to MREE in this critically ill population and the estimate by the empirical formula was as good and simpler to perform. Although values by the Harris-Benedict formula and empirical formula correlated significantly with MREE (P less than 0.05) the correlation coefficients were low: 0.48 and 0.45 respectively. Thus, mean estimates were excellent for the group but less predictive for the individual. Multiple linear regressions did reveal that body composition and metabolic stress were of greater predictive value, since an equation relating weight (P less than 0.003), sex (P less than 0.003), white blood cell count (P less than 0.003) and 24-h urinary creatinine excretion (P less than 0.05) could predict 76 per cent of the variation (r = 0.87) in the MREE with an overall significance of P = 0.0002. Given the importance of matching energy intake to needs in many critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated, accurate measurement of the REE is recommended now that instrumentation is equal to the task.\r"

We have measured GS (by hand dynamometry), total body protein (indirectly by mid-arm muscle circumference, and directly by in vivo neutron activation analysis) and the proportion of protein loss (protein index) in 80 patients with gastrointestinal disease and 87 normal volunteers. Using regression analysis, a matched study and clinical decision analysis, it has been demonstrated that GS is a sensitive measurement of the degree of protein loss. The results support more widespread use of GS measurements in the identification of patients at high risk of postoperative complications and in the monitoring of patient response to nutritional intervention.\r"

The incidence of cholelithiasis was not related significantly to the sex or age of the patients. Morbidity from cholelithiasis was not negligible. Three of the fourteen patients presenting with gallstones required medical treatment in hospital and later came to cholecystectomy because of specific biliary symptoms. Cholelithiasis appears to be a significant complication after total gastrectomy. It may be related to the vagotomy which is performed at the time of gastrectomy.\r"

Hospitalization is avoided and the patients maintain a normal daily life. Approximately 15-20 per cent of all rectal cancer patients may be expected to fulfil the criteria for selection, which are sufficiently strict that the local control (95 per cent) and 5-year survival rates (94 per cent) can exceed those of surgery for comparable disease.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral posterior cerebral infarction, sparing memory-related structures in the diencephalon, may represent a means of investigating the role of hippocampal afferents and the parahippocampal areas in memory processing. Among 30 patients with unilateral posterior cerebral infarction a group of 12 subjects with left-sided lesions suffered from marked verbal memory and learning dysfunction, whereas the remaining subjects with left or right-sided lesions showed no obvious memory deficit. The impairment was most prominent for verbal learning tasks, while recall of isolated and complex verbal information appeared to be less affected. In some cases the memory disturbance could be detected up to one year after the causative event. Analysis by CT scanning revealed a coincidence of mnestic disturbances with lesions around the left collateral sulcus affecting the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and the collateral isthmus. The latter term refers to the fibre stem of the medial temporal lobe limited by the floor of the lateral ventricle and the depth of the collateral sulcus. Through this bottle-neck, bidirectional fibres run between the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and different sensory-specific and multimodal association areas. A lesion within the collateral isthmus or, more particularly, a combined lesion of the collateral isthmus and the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, deprives the hippocampus itself of its main afferent projection source and, on the other hand, prevents dissemination of the hippocampal output to widespread neocortical areas. It cannot be excluded, at least in some cases, that small lesions in the fimbria-fornix route, in the retrosplenial cortex or in the hippocampal formation itself also contribute to the memory and learning dysfunction. However, these small lesions, so far as they could be detected by CT scanning, were present in patients with and without memory disturbances.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cholinergic 'blockade' on human memory performance as a model for the effect of cholinergic depletion in clinical disorders was investigated. A wide range of memory functions was assessed in 70 subjects, using tests which were identical or closely similar to those which have previously been employed in clinical studies of Alzheimer and Korsakoff patients. In addition, a physiological measure of the degree of central cholinergic blockade was included, as well as measures of subjective arousal and objective attention. It was found that cholinergic blockade had no significant effect on the more passive aspects of primary (or 'working') memory, namely span tests and a measure of verbal short-term forgetting; in this, it contrasts with the marked deficits seen in Alzheimer-type dementia. On the other hand, cholinergic blockade produced impairment at a visuospatial short-term forgetting test, and at a verbal test in which the distractor task was made more difficult. On tests of secondary memory, cholinergic blockade produced a pattern similar to that seen in the anterograde amnesia of Alzheimer and Korsakoff patients, namely a pronounced impairment in learning verbal and visuospatial material, a 'normal' forgetting rate once learning had been accomplished, and relative preservation of the response to priming and of skill learning (procedural memory). Cholinergic blockade, however, did not produce a retrograde amnesia, nor did it affect the recall of temporal context or of long-established semantic knowledge. This pattern of results is compared with that obtained in previous studies of Alzheimer and Korsakoff patients.\r"

Both patients were fluent and had normal articulation and phonological production and neither was agrammatic, suggesting that even very large frontal lesions do not produce Broca's aphasia and that language cortex proper is confined to the postcentral perisylvian region. Both patients were impaired in the use of more complex syntactic structures and one, who in addition had severe generalized impairment in frontal lobe function, also had impaired judgement regarding the use and placement of functors. These data provide further support for the dissociability of syntactic and morphological aspects of grammar in aphasic patients and, together with other studies, link these functions with the frontal lobe and the postcentral perisylvian cortex, respectively. The sparing of grammatical judgement in 1 patient, despite a very extensive lesion, suggests that very large portions of the frontal lobe are involved in grammatical function. The nature of frontal lobe function in syntax appears to be congruent with the role of the frontal lobes in other aspects of behaviour.\r"

High alcohol consumption is frequently associated and the peripheral neuropathy of MSL is often attributed to alcoholism. In this study, sural nerve biopsies from MSL patients revealed an absence of acute axonal degeneration, a significant shift to the left of myelinated fibre diameter distributions, reduced indices of axonal and nerve fibre circularity, and an increase in myelin periodicity. This pathology supports the view that the neuropathy of MSL is not alcohol-induced but that a chronic distal axonopathy is an integral part of the MSL syndrome. Biochemical observations suggest a defect in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in MSL at a membrane level, possibly in the amount or function of Gs membrane protein or in the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase. Evidence is presented that the frequent association of MSL with alcoholism is on the basis of an additional ethanol-induced membrane lesion involving beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

Neither of these tests was significantly correlated with an ideomotor apraxia test (imitation of movements). Ideational apraxia was frequently, but not exclusively, associated with damage to the left posterior temporoparietal junction.

In 27 cases measurements were also obtained during the headache-free interval. Ocular sympathetic function was impaired on the symptomatic side between cluster attacks and function was reduced further during cluster headache. Greater heat loss from the orbital region on the symptomatic side was associated with ocular sympathetic dysfunction both during and between attacks, and with lachrymation during attacks. Heat loss from the cheek and side of the nose was greater on the symptomatic side in patients whose attack was accompanied by lachrymation, but heat loss from these areas was unrelated to the extent of ocular sympathetic deficit. These findings suggest that parasympathetic overactivity in the greater superficial petrosal nerve provokes facial flushing and lachrymation. Parasympathetic overactivity could also cause dilatation of the internal carotid artery and compression of the periarterial plexus of sympathetic fibres, producing a sympathetic deficit with release of vasoconstrictor tone in the eye. Thus autonomic disturbances in cluster headache may be explained by the unitary hypothesis of parasympathetic hyperactivity being responsible for ocular sympathetic deficit.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments are described in which the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist bicuculline was injected into the lentiform complex of conscious monkeys. Injections into either the lateral segment of the globus pallidus, or the medial part of the putamen, gave rise to chorea of the contralateral limbs and/or orofacial region. Control injections of vehicle alone were without effect. Injections of bicuculline into the lateral part of the putamen gave rise to contralateral myoclonus. The chorea produced by lateral pallidal or medial putaminal injections was virtually indistinguishable from the dyskinesia (chorea/ballism) which has been shown, in previous studies, to be induced by injection of GABA antagonists into the subthalamic nucleus. It is proposed that the primary site of action of the GABA antagonist in producing chorea, in the present studies, was the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. The mode of action is suggested to be interruption of GABAergic transmission from the striatum to the lateral pallidal segment. Since this also occurs in Huntington's disease, it is proposed that experimental chorea induced by this method in the monkey may be a useful model of the dyskinesia seen in Huntington's disease in man. Loss of influence of inhibitory striatopallidal fibres would lead to abnormally increased activity of lateral pallidal neurons. These in turn project to the subthalamic nucleus, upon which they have an inhibitory action. Dyskinesia is thus produced by physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus, whose destruction, both in man and the monkey, is known to produce ballism. It is proposed that ballism and chorea share common neural mechanisms, both involving the loss of influence of the subthalamic nucleus on the medial segment of the globus pallidus.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with clinically complete cervical spinal cord transection developed rhythmic myoclonic movements of the trunk and lower limbs, demonstrating that, in man, such movements can be generated within the spinal cord itself when deprived of supraspinal control. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings used to define the features of the myoclonus, which had a frequency of 0.3-0.6 Hz, was bilaterally symmetric, and involved extensor muscles. The EMG bursts always appeared in phase in all muscles involved. Peripheral stimulation of flexor reflex afferents (FRA) could induce, slow or interrupt the rhythmic activity. When FRA stimulation induced a flexion reflex, it occurred between extensor EMG bursts and induced alternating flexion-extension activity which could be sustained for several cycles. Soleus and quadriceps monosynaptic reflexes were depressed during the silent period of the rhythmic activity. Several arguments, mainly the great sensitivity of the myoclonus to flexor reflex afferent stimulation, suggest that the myoclonus observed in this patient was due to partial release of a spinal stepping generator.\r"

  ".W": "Control of isometric forces during grasping or handling of objects is an essential feature of all skilled manual performances. Previous studies of hand function in cerebellar patients were restricted to movements; force control was only investigated under isotonic conditions in combination with movements. Control of isometric forces during voluntary contraction of finger muscles was investigated in 31 patients with chronic cerebellar disease and in 20 normal controls. Eight patients with Friedreich's ataxia were considered to be typical for a disease affecting the afferents to the cerebellum; 4 patients with anterior lobe atrophy, which affects leg movements to a greater extent than finger movements, were compared with 3 patients with hemisphere lesions; 16 patients suffered from diffuse cerebellar atrophy. Using a recently developed microcomputer system for the continuous measurement of finger force, control of isometric force was studied in several tasks within the same subjects. The tasks included the maintenance of constant force output at different force levels with and without visual feedback, fast repetitive force changes, tracking of a sinusoidal target presented visually, and measurement of maximum grip force. The amount of voluntary contraction in terms of muscular power was normal in all patients; in all other tasks clear deficits were observed. The extent of the disturbances was highly variable between patients even within the same clinical subgroup. The detailed analysis of force traces revealed a great variety in types of disturbance. The frequently observed slowing of the speed in repetitive force changes can be attributed to different components in different patients and not only to difficulties at turning points as might be predicted from comparable movement studies. In addition, performance deficits across different tasks were not uniform, indicating dissociation of impairment. Deficits in maintaining force, which may be interpreted as dysmetria or due to tremor, do not necessarily imply an abnormality in diadochokinesis, as measured in fast repetitive force changes, nor does the converse apply.\r"

  ".W": "Single-letter flash cards were made at contrast values of 96%, 7% and 4% to compare high-, intermediate- and low-contrast visual performance in amblyopic children young enough to benefit from occlusion therapy. The single-letter format was intended to differentiate the effect of contrast on reading performance from any effects of nearby contours. Two groups of patients were tested: 37 children aged 3 to 8 years who had completed occlusion therapy and 15 children aged 4 to 8 years who were still receiving occlusion therapy. Their results were compared with the results of 45 control subjects aged 3 to 8 years. Three patterns of visual loss were identified in the patients: predominantly for high-contrast acuity, fairly uniform at high-, intermediate- and low-contrast levels, and, in two patients, loss at low- and intermediate-contrast levels with relative sparing at the high-contrast level. The incidence of high-contrast acuity loss was not significantly different between the two groups, but the proportion of children with no acuity loss at any contrast level was 54% in the group that had completed treatment, compared with 17% of those who were still receiving treatment.\r"

Initial therapy with topical antibiotics and steroids failed to control the scleritis and keratitis. Subsequent treatment with plasmapheresis led to a decrease in circulating immune complex and serum immunoglobulin levels, with resolution of the ocular inflammation. After 8 years of follow-up the serum IgG and IgM levels were again elevated; however, the corneal disease remained quiescent. Plasmapheresis may have a role in the therapy of this and other immune-complex-mediated ocular diseases.\r"

Ocular disease may occur with inactive systemic disease. We describe two patients in whom optic nerve involvement was the first manifestation of sarcoidosis and clinically mimicked an optic nerve tumour. Sarcoidosis involving the optic nerve should be considered when an optic nerve tumour is suspected.\r"
