  ".W": "To determine the frequency and risk factors for female to male sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a prospective study was carried out in 422 men who had acquired a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from a group of prostitutes with a prevalence of HIV-1 infection of 85%. The initial seroprevalence of HIV among the men was 12%. 24 of 293 (8.2%) initially seronegative men seroconverted to HIV-1. Newly acquired infection was independently associated with frequent prostitute contact (risk ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-8.1), with the acquisition of genital ulcer disease (risk ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.0), and with being uncircumcised (risk ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 3.0-23.0). 96% of documented seroconversions occurred in men with one or both of the latter two risk factors. In a subgroup of 73 seronegative men who reported a single prostitute sexual contact, the frequency of HIV-1 infection was 8.2% during 12 weeks of observation. No man without a genital ulcer seroconverted. A cumulative 43% of uncircumcised men who acquired an ulcer seroconverted to HIV-1 after a single sexual exposure. These data indicate an extremely high rate of female to male transmission of HIV-1 in the presence of STD and confirm a causal relation between lack of male circumcision, genital ulcer disease, and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".U": "89343394\r", 
  ".W": "Between July and November, 1988, 1501 consecutive adult medical admissions to the two largest hospitals in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, were studied. The overall prevalence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 was 43% in hospital A and 28% in hospital B. AIDS accounted for 19% and 9%, respectively, of medical admissions to the two hospitals, and for 33% of medical deaths in hospital A. The risk of death was significantly higher in HIV-seropositive patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (risk ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.2) and in HIV-positive patients who did not meet the AIDS case-definition (risk ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) than HIV-negative patients. The male/female ratio of the 265 cases of AIDS identified was 4.8. 50% of patients with AIDS were seropositive for HIV-1 only, 4% for HIV-2 only, and 46% reacted serologically to both viruses. The minimum incidence of AIDS in adult male and female residents of Abidjan (per million per year) is estimated at 1447 and 340 cases, respectively. AIDS in this West African city has emerged as a major public health problem.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil leucocytosis is associated with a poor outcome in the haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This study tested the hypothesis that neutrophils from HUS patients are activated and through release of their intracellular contents damage endothelium. The proportion of neutrophils adhering to endothelium in culture was twice as high for HUS patients' neutrophils as for control neutrophils (n = 12). In addition, these neutrophils induced endothelial injury, assessed morphologically by degradation of endothelial cell fibronectin. In an attempt to inhibit neutrophil adhesion and subsequent endothelial damage the hyperadhesive neutrophils from HUS patients were incubated with a CD18 antibody directed against the common beta chain of the leucocyte integrin molecules. The CD18 antibody was able to abrogate endothelial damage in four of the ten subjects studied. These observations suggest that the neutrophil is of prime pathophysiological importance in HUS, and that methods aimed at reducing neutrophil adhesion and neutrophil-mediated endothelial damage are likely to be beneficial.\r"

The mean stool output over the first 24 h of treatment in the group receiving standard ORS was significantly higher than that of any other treatment group, and the groups receiving food-based ORT showed substantial reductions in stool output compared with the standard ORT group. Abnormalities in electrolyte concentrations were corrected in all treatment groups with similar efficiency. The digestibility of the food-based ORS was assessed by the stool pH, glucose content before and after acid hydrolysis, and osmolality; there were no significant differences between the standard ORS and food-based ORS groups. Food-based ORT should be more acceptable to users in developing countries since the mixtures are similar to traditional weaning foods and since, unlike standard ORT, it reduces stool output substantially.\r"

Endoscopic sphincterotomy was successful in 975 of these patients, with eventual bileduct clearance in 674 of 772 patients (87.3%) with visible stones; immediate bileduct drainage was achieved in 160 of the 161 patients (99%) in whom bileduct clearance failed at the first attempt. Overall, 771 of 797 patients (96.7%) with visible bileduct stones had successful bileduct clearance or drainage. Complications occurred in 6.9%, with a 30-day mortality rate of 1.2%, but procedure-related mortality was only 0.6%.\r"

DVT was significantly more common in winter months and usually occurred within 2 weeks of treatment being started. This probable association between rifampicin and DVT does not contraindicate use of this drug, but measures to prevent DVT should be taken in inpatients receiving rifampicin.\r"

Normal-spiking-mode pulses typically leave 10-50 microns of collagen damage at the smooth wall of the incisions; however, at the highest fluences (approximately 80J/cm2) tears were produced in cornea and aorta and as much as 100 microns of damaged collagen is found at the incision edge.

Bone is readily ablated by 2.94 microns radiation; however, at per pulse fluences greater than 20 J/cm2, plasma formation decreases ablation efficiency. At low fluence, desiccation can prevent efficient ablation of bone. The ablation efficiency for aorta and skin is higher than for bone. The ablation efficiency, 540 micrograms/J, and the ablation depth per pulse, greater than 400 microns, for skin are too high to be readily explained by simple models of ablation and thus provide evidence for a more complex explosive removal process.\r"

High-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by an XeCl excimer laser (308 nm) and delivered through suitable optical fibers can be used to remove residual organic tissue from the canals. To this aim, UV ablation thresholds of dental tissues have been measured, showing a preferential etching of infiltrated dentin in respect to healthy dentin, at laser fluences of 0.5-1.5 J/cm2. This technique has been tested on extracted tooth samples, simulating a clinical procedure. Fibers of decreasing core diameters have been used to treat different sections of the root canal down to its apical portion, resulting in an effective, easy, and fast cleaning action. Possible advantages of excimer laser clinical applications in respect to usual procedures are also discussed.\r"

The diagnostic system is based on ultraviolet-induced fluorescence spectroscopy and uses suitable optical fibers for local delivery of excitation light and to collect back fluorescence spectra. Spectra of root canal tissues have been obtained from split teeth by labeling with a fluorescent solution. Residual tissue can be discriminated in respect to healthy dentin because of their different spectral responses: the spectral shape of the first response shows a clear peak at 530 nm because of a selective absorption of the fluorescent dye, whereas for the second response, the spectral curve monotonically increases toward ultraviolet wave-lengths with no particular structure. This technique has been tested on unsplit teeth simulating operative conditions. A compact spectroscopic system has been devised that can be easily integrated in an excimer laser system to perform residual tissue detection during laser cleaning of the canals.\r"

Laser parameters necessary for osteotomy were shown to produce deep cuts with sharp edges and no gross charring or burning of adjacent bone. However, it was noted histologically that there was a delay in healing of the laser osteotomies as compared to saw osteotomies. This delay was caused by a microscopic zone of damage to bone adjacent to the laser cuts. It is concluded that, although the erbium: YAG laser may be a useful tool in orthopaedic surgery to ablate bone, under the conditions used in this study, there will be a delay in the healing process after laser osteotomy.\r"

To determine the significance of reflectance changes induced by laser irradiation, we examined the reflectance of liver samples during pulsed holmium laser ablation by placing the target at one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and a detector at the other focus. The temporal behavior, total reflectance, and effect of multiple pulses were examined. Tissue reflectance as large as 50% was observed during holmium laser irradiation but depended upon laser radiant exposure and number of laser pulses. These measurements suggest that changes in the optical properties of the target during ablation are important and should be considered in detailed modeling of the ablation process.\r"

In addition, the immediate and delayed gross and histologic changes induced at, above, and below the threshold radiant exposures at all four wavelengths were studied. The action spectrum in the black guinea pigs was consistent with the reported absorption spectrum of DOPA-melanin. Histologically, there was epidermal damage immediately after radiant exposures at and above threshold at all four wavelengths. In addition, radiant exposures greater than threshold caused an immediate decrease in stainable epidermal pigment that was most marked at 435 and 488 nm. The healing response was also wavelength- and dose-dependent. Seven days after above-threshold exposures, there was little epidermal pigment in the 435 nm specimens. As wavelength increased, there was progressively more pigment, and in the 560 nm specimens, the epidermal pigment was equivalent to that seen in nonirradiated black guinea pig control specimens. Seven days after subthreshold radiant exposures, there was increased epidermal pigmentation and melanocytes at all four wavelengths. This was the most pronounced in the 435 nm specimens. There was no observable epidermal damage in albino guinea pig skin.\r"

However, it is very difficult to reproduce the parameters of laser treatment. This leads to inaccurate energy dosages secondary to the difference in treatment patterns. The aim of this study was to compare the conventional point-by-point technique (PT) for PWS treatment against a new scanning technique (ST) using a device called \"Hexascan\" (PREIN & Partners, Ferney-Voltaire, France). A total of 249 patients (171 females and 78 males) using the argon laser have been studied in a retrospective study. Clinical results are presented. For each technique, blanching and hypertrophic scarring were examined. The results are classified into two groups: satisfactory and unsatisfactory. The clinical results show that the ST with the Hexascan is superior to the conventional PT. Scarring is drastically reduced because overdosage and overheating are avoided. Because of precisely controlled spot patterns, quality and homogeneity of blanching is improved. Treatment time can be reduced to 20% of that of the PT.\r"

  ".W": "Temperature rise of laser-irradiated tissue due to direct absorption of laser light is related to laser parameters (power, spot size, irradiation time, and repetition rate) and tissue parameters (absorption and scattering coefficients, density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity). Solutions to the bio-heat equation are approximated by introducing axial (z) and radial (r) time constants for heat conduction that represent two parallel channels for heat conduction. These axial (tau z) and radial (tau r) time constants are found proportional to squared distances (z02, r02) that represent the extent of axial and radial temperatures respectively. For convenience, z0 and r0 are approximated to the axial and radial extent of laser light in the tissue. The resulting solution of the bio-heat equation, expressed as temperature rise as function of time and position, is obviously exact for irradiation times short compared to ta z, tau r (adiabatic heating), but is also a quite reasonable approximation up to irradiation times three times the overall time constant. Comparison with (exact) numerical computations show that this holds for all ratios of (light) penetration depth to laser-beam radius; for strongly scattering materials, smaller laser beams give better predictions than do larger laser beams. Several examples of clinical relevance are discussed, such as multiple-laser-pulse irradiation of high- and low-absorbing tissues and laser treatment of port-wine stains, with some unexpected results that also show potential clinical relevance.\r"

The consequences for infants of maternal drinking during breast-feeding are unknown, but research in animals suggests that the infant could be affected by exposure to alcohol through the mother's milk. In a study of 400 infants born to members of a health maintenance organization, we investigated the relation of the mother's use of alcohol during breast-feeding to the infant's development at one year of age. Mental development, as measured by the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI), was unrelated to maternal drinking during breast-feeding. However, motor development, as measured by the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), was significantly lower in infants exposed regularly to alcohol in breast milk (after alcohol exposure during gestation was controlled for), with a dose-response relation (P for linear trend, 0.006). The infants of breast-feeding mothers who had at least one drink daily had a mean PDI score of 98, whereas the infants exposed to less alcohol in breast milk had a mean PDI score of 103 (95 percent confidence interval for the difference of the two means, 1.2 to 9.8). The effect was more pronounced when mothers who supplemented breast-feeding with formula were excluded from the analysis. The association persisted even after we controlled for more than 100 potentially confounding variables, including smoking and other drug use during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. We conclude that ethanol ingested through breast milk has a slight but significant detrimental effect on motor development, but not mental development, in breast-fed infants.\r"

  ".W": "Whether taking multivitamins or folate around the time of conception can reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a neural-tube defect is controversial. To investigate this question, we examined the periconceptional use of vitamin supplements by women who had a conceptus with a neural-tube defect (n = 571), women who had had a stillbirth or a conceptus with another malformation (n = 546), and women who had had a normal conceptus (n = 573). Women with conceptuses with neural-tube defects were identified either prenatally or postnatally and were matched to control mothers for gestational age. To minimize recall bias, we interviewed nearly all the women within five months of the diagnosis of a birth defect or the birth of the infant (mean, 84 days); information on vitamin use was obtained by an interviewer who was unaware of the outcome of pregnancy. The rate of periconceptional multivitamin use among the mothers of infants with neural-tube defects (15.8 percent) was not significantly different from the rate among mothers in either the abnormal or the normal control group (14.1 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the odds ratio for having an infant with a neural-tube defect among women classified as having had full supplementation with multivitamins was 0.95 as compared with the mothers of the abnormal infants (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.14) and 1.00 as compared with the mothers of normal infants (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.20). There were no differences among the groups in the use of folate supplements. The adjusted odds ratio for having an infant with a neural-tube defect among those receiving the recommended daily allowance of folate was 0.97 as compared with the mothers of abnormal infants (95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.18) and 0.98 as compared with the mothers of normal infants (95 percent confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.20). We conclude that the periconceptional use of multivitamins or folate-containing supplements by American women does not decrease the risk of having an infant with a neural-tube defect.\r"

It is unclear whether the difference--if any--is due to a lowering of the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. We therefore placed 31 women and 27 men on a mixed natural diet rich in saturated fat (19.3 percent of their daily energy intake from saturated fat, 11.5 percent from monounsaturated fat, and 4.6 percent from polyunsaturated fat) for 17 days. For the next 36 days, they received a mixed diet with the same total fat content, but enriched with olive oil and sunflower oil (\"monounsaturated-fat diet\": 12.9 percent saturated fat, 15.1 percent monounsaturated fat, and 7.9 percent polyunsaturated fat) or with sunflower oil alone (\"polyunsaturated-fat diet\": 12.6 percent saturated fat, 10.8 percent monounsaturated fat, and 12.7 percent polyunsaturated fat). The serum LDL cholesterol level decreased by 17.9 percent in those on the monounsaturated-fat diet and by 12.9 percent in those on the polyunsaturated-fat diet (95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the effects of the two unsaturated-fat diets, -9.9 percent to 0.0 percent). In men, the HDL cholesterol level fell slightly but not significantly with both diets. In women, the HDL cholesterol level did not change with either. We conclude that a mixed diet rich in monounsaturated fat was as effective as a diet rich in (n-6)polyunsaturated fat in lowering LDL cholesterol. Both diets lowered the level of HDL cholesterol slightly in men but not in women.\r"

  ".W": "In the spring and summer of 1988, two separate outbreaks of an illness with a rash resembling erythema infectiosum occurred among members of the nursing staff of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The sources were two adolescent patients with sickle cell disease and aplastic crisis who had unsuspected parvovirus infection. Tests for IgM and IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19 were positive in both patients, and electron microscopical examination showed parvovirus-like particles in the early serum samples. Of 40 health care workers exposed to infected patients, 12 (30 percent) were infected, 2 (5 percent) were possibly infected, 8 (20 percent) had evidence of a past infection with B19, and 18 (45 percent) remained seronegative. Attack rates among the susceptible contacts were 36 percent in the first outbreak and at least 38 percent in the second. Clinical symptoms began a mean of 12.6 days after exposure and included malaise, rash, and joint pain. We conclude that hospital workers are at risk of contracting nosocomial erythema infectiosum from patients with parvovirus-associated aplastic crisis. We recommend that all patients with hereditary hemolytic anemias who are admitted with a febrile illness be evaluated for aplasia and promptly placed in respiratory and contact isolation if aplastic crisis is suspected.\r"

  ".W": "Severe hyponatremia occurs in some patients with untreated hypopituitarism, but it is not known whether such hyponatremia is caused by the hypersecretion of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). This report describes severe, symptomatic hyponatremia in five women 59 to 83 years old (serum sodium, 111 to 118 mmol per liter) who presented with hypopituitarism (which had been previously undiagnosed in four). Plasma vasopressin was inappropriately high (1.3 to 25.8 pmol per liter [1.4 to 28 ng per liter]) in relation to plasma osmolality (236 to 260 mOsm per kilogram of body weight). All five patients had normal renal function and no signs of dehydration or volume depletion. The hyponatremia was resolved within a few days after the institution of hydrocortisone therapy, after infusion of normotonic or hypertonic saline had been found to be less effective. When four of the patients were later restudied while receiving maintenance hydrocortisone treatment, the relation between plasma vasopressin and osmolality was normal. We conclude that ACTH deficiency may cause the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. The beneficial effect of hydrocortisone is probably exerted through the suppression of vasopressin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Trichotillomania, an irresistible impulse to pull out one's own hair, is a chronic psychiatric illness that causes severe discomfort, interferes with daily activities, and leads to social isolation. Treatment is usually unsatisfactory. Thirteen women with severe trichotillomania completed a 10-week double-blind, crossover trial of clomipramine, a new tricyclic antidepressant agent with selective antiobsessional effects, and desipramine, a standard tricyclic antidepressant. Treatment with clomipramine resulted in significantly greater improvement in symptoms than desipramine, as indicated by physicians' ratings of the women's clinical progress on a scale in which lower scores indicate improvement (mean [+/- SD] scores: at base line, 10.0; after desipramine treatment, 8.7 +/- 2.4; after clomipramine treatment, 4.7 +/- 3.1; P = 0.006) and by scores on a trichotillomania-impairment scale, in which higher scores indicate greater impairment (at base line, 6.8 +/- 1.7; after desipramine treatment, 6.2 +/- 1.7; after clomipramine treatment, 4.2 +/- 2.7; P = 0.03). The severity of symptoms (mean base-line score, 15.9 +/- 3.8) was reduced more by clomipramine (10.6 +/- 6.4) than by desipramine (14.4 +/- 3.9). The patients reported that the compulsion decreased in intensity and that they were more able to resist the urge to pull out their hair during treatment with clomipramine. We conclude that clomipramine appears to be effective in the short-term treatment of trichotillomania.\r"

  ".W": "We report the results of the Ticlopidine Aspirin Stroke Study, a blinded trial at 56 North American centers that compared the effects of ticlopidine hydrochloride (500 mg daily) with those of aspirin (1300 mg daily) on the risk of stroke or death. The medications were randomly assigned to 3069 patients with recent transient or mild persistent focal cerebral or retinal ischemia. Follow-up lasted for two to six years. The three-year event rate for nonfatal stroke or death from any cause was 17 percent for ticlopidine and 19 percent for aspirin--a 12 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, -2 to 26 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.048 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). The rates of fatal and nonfatal stroke at three years were 10 percent for ticlopidine and 13 percent for aspirin--a 21 percent risk reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 38 percent) with ticlopidine (P = 0.024 for cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates). Ticlopidine was more effective than aspirin in both sexes. The adverse effects of aspirin included diarrhea (10 percent), rash (5.5 percent), peptic ulceration (3 percent), gastritis (2 percent), and gastrointestinal bleeding (1 percent). With ticlopidine, diarrhea (20 percent), skin rash (14 percent), and severe but reversible neutropenia (less than 1 percent) were noted. The mean increase in total cholesterol level was 9 percent with ticlopidine and 2 percent with aspirin (P less than 0.01). The ratios of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol were similar in both treatment groups. We conclude that ticlopidine was somewhat more effective than aspirin in preventing strokes in this population, although the risks of side effects were greater.\r"

  ".W": "In this study of hospital discharge data on births to residents of an eight-county region of California, we found an increasing lack of health insurance that was associated with an elevated and increasing risk of adverse outcomes in newborns. Between 1982 and 1986, the percentage of newborns without health insurance increased overall by 45 percent (from 5.5 to 8.0 percent; P less than 0.001); the increases were larger among Asians (by 54 percent [from 7.8 to 12.0 percent]; P less than 0.001) and Latinos (by 140 percent [from 8.2 to 19.7 percent]; P less than 0.001). By 1986, the odds ratio for an adverse hospital outcome (defined as a prolonged hospital stay, transfer of the newborn to another institution, or death) was 1.31 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.46) in uninsured as compared with privately insured newborns, with control for race or ethnic group. There was a significant increase in risk over time (P less than 0.03); the comparable odds ratios in 1982 and 1984 were 1.11 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.33) and 1.19 (1.05 to 1.35), respectively. In 1986 the risks were especially elevated for uninsured as compared with privately insured blacks and Latinos (odds ratios, 2.24 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.60 to 3.13] and 1.56 [1.26 to 1.94], respectively); the increases in risk over time were the most marked in these groups. We believe that the elevated and increasing risks for uninsured newborns are explained at least in part by inadequate and diminishing access to care and that this burden is borne disproportionately by blacks and Latinos.\r"

Of 72 infants whose mothers had hypertension during pregnancy, 35 (49 percent) had neutropenia, which persisted from 1 hour to 30 days. The disorder was more prevalent among newborns whose growth had been retarded in utero (P less than 0.01), those who had been delivered prematurely (P less than 0.001), and those whose mothers had had severe hypertension (P less than 0.002) or hypertension and the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) (P less than 0.01). Kinetic investigations of circulating, marginated, storage, and proliferative neutrophils and their progenitors suggested that the neutropenia was the result of diminished neutrophil production. Noscomial infections occurred during the first 2 1/2 weeks of life in eight (23 percent) of the newborns with neutropenia, but in only one (3 percent) of those without this disorder (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the neonatal neutropenia associated with maternal hypertension is due to transiently reduced neutrophil production and is associated with an increased risk of noscomial infection. Its basic cause remains unknown.\r"

A total of 433 cholecystectomies and 179 cases of newly symptomatic, unremoved gallstones, diagnosed by ultrasonographic examination or x-ray films, were reported during the four-year follow-up. The age-adjusted relative risk for very obese women, who had a Quetelet index of relative weight (weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of more than 32 kg per square meter, was 6.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.0), as compared with women whose relative weight was less than 20 kg per square meter. For slightly overweight women (relative weight, 24 to 24.9 kg per square meter), the relative risk was 1.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.7). Overall, we observed a roughly linear relation between relative weight and the risk of gallstones. Among the 59,306 women whose relative weight was less than 25 kg per square meter, a high energy intake (greater than 8200 J per day), as compared with a low energy intake (less than 4730 J per day), was associated with an increased incidence of symptomatic gallstones (relative risk, 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.3), and an alcohol intake of at least 5 g per day was associated with a decreased incidence as compared with abstention (relative risk, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.8). Parity did not appear to be an important risk factor after an adjustment was made for relative weight. These data support a strong association between obesity and symptomatic gallstones and suggest that even moderate overweight may increase the risk.\r"

The patients presented with an acute febrile illness, severe hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen less than 60 mm Hg), diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, an increased number of eosinophils (mean +/- SEM, 42 +/- 4.8 percent) in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, and an absence of infection and previous atopic illness. The illness resolved rapidly after treatment with erythromycin and corticosteroids. The patients received doses of oral prednisone that were tapered over 10 days to 12 weeks, and none have relapsed since the steroids were discontinued. After a minimum follow-up period of five months, clinical evaluation, chest radiography, and pulmonary-function tests have shown no residual abnormalities attributable to the acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Follow-up bronchoalveolar lavage has demonstrated less than or equal to 1 percent eosinophils in all patients. We believe that we are describing an acute form of eosinophilic lung disease distinct from previously described syndromes. It can be diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage and seems to respond to treatment with corticosteroids.\r"

PIMS is a pulsatile, programmable pump with a battery life expectancy of five years. The reservoir is refilled transcutaneously every two months with a surfactant-stabilized human insulin preparation containing 400 U of insulin per milliliter. Eighteen patients received PIMS-delivered insulin for 4 to 25 months (mean, 18). The total PIMS-implantation experience comprised 28 patient-years. Good glycemic control was established and sustained during treatment (mean plasma glucose level, 7.3 mmol per liter; mean glycohemoglobin level, 8 percent [upper limit of normal, 7.5 percent]), with significantly reduced glycemic fluctuations. The total mean daily insulin dose did not change. Insulin solutions withdrawn from the pump reservoirs contained 92 percent native insulin and preserved biologic activity. There were no surgical or skin complications, severe hypoglycemic episodes, or instances of diabetic ketoacidosis. One pump was replaced because of a manufacturing defect, and four patients had catheter blockages due to omental-tissue encapsulation; two withdrew from the study and two had devices that were repaired successfully. The actuarial rate of survival of catheter function was 78 percent at 1.5 years. We conclude from this pilot study that insulin treatment with an implanted, variable-rate, programmable pump is feasible for periods up to two years.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen children with infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic EEG defined by EEG-videotelemetry monitoring received a regimen of high-dose (150 IU/m2/d) ACTH for their seizures. We carried out an endocrinologic evaluation before and after initiation of the ACTH and conducted a time course study of plasma ACTH and cortisol levels after ACTH dosing. Spasms were controlled and the EEG normalized in 14 of the 15 children. Prior to starting ACTH therapy all the patients had normal prolactin, insulin, cortisol, and ACTH levels in plasma and normal thyroid function. Although the pattern of rise of ACTH levels in plasma after ACTH dosing was similar in all the children, there was great individual variation in the absolute concentrations. However, both the pattern of rise and absolute level of cortisol in plasma after ACTH was highly predictable in all patients. Plasma cortisol rose rapidly within 1 hour of ACTH administration and continued a slower rise for 12 to 24 hours after the ACTH dose. High-dose ACTH therapy seems quite effective in infantile spasms, perhaps because of a sustained high level of plasma cortisol. This sustained plateau of cortisol may be more effective in controlling infantile spasms than the pulse effect expected with oral steroids or lower doses of ACTH.\r"

The existence of the 1st and 2nd phenotypes within the same sibship suggests that they are variant expressions of the same clinicopathologic disorder. Niemann-Pick disease type C should be considered not only in infants and children who present with organomegaly and a progressive neurodegenerative course, but also in adolescents and adults who have insidiously progressive neurologic dysfunction and only slight organomegaly. Associated with the disease is a marked deficiency in the ability of cultured fibroblasts to esterify exogenously supplied cholesterol. Assay of this deficiency is particularly useful for confirming the diagnosis in patients with atypical presentation.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a new animal model of stroke which resembles human stroke more closely than existing models. We described the pathology produced in the brain following platelet embolism, previously described only in the retina. The common carotid artery of the rat was irradiated for 6.5 minutes with an argon laser at 514.5 nm after intravenous injection of a photosensitizing agent, rose bengal. A retinal embolus was seen in 1 rat 5 minutes after irradiation. A nonocclusive platelet thrombus was present in the carotid artery 50 minutes after irradiation, with almost all the platelet thrombus being cleared 24 hours later. Acute (1 to 10 days) changes in the brain included 44 small infarcts in 12/13 rats, cortical arterioles occluded with platelets and thickening of small vessels in normotensive rats. Chronic (4 to 12 weeks) changes included lacunes in the brains of normotensive rats and intimal proliferation of smooth muscle in the carotid artery. This is the 1st animal model of (1) stroke with emboli produced in vivo rather than injected into the carotid, (2) intimal proliferation of smooth muscle without invasion of the vessel, and (3) lacunes. This model provides results important to the laboratory study of stroke.\r"

Thirty-five percent of sera blocked BGT binding to the AChR, some at a dilution of up to 1:1000. The 7 patients whose sera blocked toxin binding were all generalized myasthenics with particularly severe disease, 6 of whom had had myasthenic crisis at some point in their course. No ocular myasthenics had blocking antibody. Blockade of toxin binding by myasthenic antibody to TE671 cells resembled blockade produced by unlabeled toxin in being irreversible with washing. There was little correlation between ability to block toxin binding and amplitude of the AChR binding antibody. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with more aggressive generalized myasthenia preferentially have anti-AChR antibody that blocks toxin binding.\r"

Responses after single stimuli were of larger size on the side of the spasm compared with the uninvolved side and controls. With paired stimuli, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning stimuli upon the test stimuli late response (R2), which was always observed in normals, was significantly less pronounced at short interstimuli intervals. This resulted in an enhanced recovery curve of R2, which was observed on the side of the spasm and the contralateral, clinically normal side. Patients with longer disease duration showed more striking abnormalities of the recovery curve. We suggest that there is enhanced excitability of facial motoneurons and of those brainstem interneurons that mediate the blink reflex pathway in patients with HFS.\r"

This change was evident at 1 month after surgery and has remained for the 6 months of follow-up. Postural reflexes were not altered in the other 2 patients. There was no change in extraocular movements, speech, or the rigid-bradykinetic features of parkinsonism in any patient.

High doses of pyridoxine (1,200 or 600 mg/kg/d) for 6 to 10 days caused a neuronopathy with necrosis of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, accompanied by centrifugal axonal atrophy and breakdown of peripheral and central sensory axons. Large diameter neurons with long processes and large cytoplasmic volumes were especially affected. Smaller doses (300 to 150 mg/kg/d) for up to 12 weeks had minor effects on DRG neurons, but produced a neuropathy with axonal atrophy and degeneration. Guinea pigs given 1,800 mg/kg/d developed sensory neuronopathy, whereas mice given similar or higher doses did not have neuropathologic abnormalities. Multiple factors including rate of administration, differential neuronal vulnerability, and species susceptibility have bearing on the final expression of pyridoxine neurotoxicity.\r"

Twenty-five percent had seizures. In one-half of these, the seizures began within 24 hours of the hemorrhage. Survival table analysis predicted a potential cumulative seizure incidence of 50%, had all patients survived 5 years. Seizure incidence was high with bleeding into lobar cortical structures (54%), low with basal ganglionic hemorrhages (19%), and zero with thalamic hemorrhages. Within the basal ganglia, caudate involvement predicted seizures; within the cortex, temporal or parietal involvement predicted seizures. Although seizure incidence was high, prevalence of chronic epilepsy was much lower: 13% in 30-day to 2-year survivors and 6.5% in 2- to 5-year survivors. Seizure incidence is higher than previously reported after ICH because small lobar hemorrhages are the most epileptogenic and are now easily recognized with computed tomography.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs disproportionately among inner-city minority women of reproductive age. Once pregnant, these women have a high risk of delivering infants with perinatally acquired infection. Identification and counseling of HIV-infected parturients may be an effective means of preventing perinatal HIV infection. Few data are available on the seroprevalence of HIV infection in the inner-city population or on the clinical and demographic determinants of risk. To better characterize HIV infection in inner-city parturients in Atlanta, we conducted routine antepartum screening for HIV antibody in 3472 women. Ten (2.8 per 1000) were seropositive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot testing. Four women were seropositive on repeat ELISA but negative on Western blot. Four infected women had had heterosexual contact with a person at risk for HIV, three were intravenous drug users, one had possibly become infected via blood transfusion, and two had no apparent risk factors. Seven of the seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors and would not have been identified if screening had been performed using current Centers for Disease Control criteria. Ten percent of the women screened had self-identified risk factors for HIV infection and were seronegative. Ninety-six percent of women consented to HIV testing. These data suggest that inner-city parturients in Atlanta are at risk for HIV infection and that routine antepartum HIV screening can be performed provided the appropriate multidisciplinary team is in place for counseling and follow-up.\r"

Our previous studies showed that plasma levels of carotene and cholesterol were correlated with birth weight. The present study examined the association between mid-pregnancy plasma levels of carotene and cholesterol and subsequent birth weight. In a prospective study of 388 women (47.8% smokers), levels of plasma nutrients and demographic and anthropometric measurements were obtained at 19 and 36 weeks' gestation and related to indices of infant size at birth. In non-smokers, the level of plasma cholesterol at mid-pregnancy correlated positively with birth weight. In contrast, in mothers who smoked more than ten cigarettes daily, the relationship of cholesterol to birth weight was dependent on the simultaneously observed level of plasma carotene. When plasma cholesterol and carotene concentrations were both low at mid-pregnancy, birth weight was low. On the other hand, when the carotene level was high and the cholesterol level low, birth weight was at least equivalent to that of non-smokers. The interactive effect of smoking, cholesterol, and carotene on birth weight was significant (P = .017) after adjusting for gestational age, sex, prenatal care, race, previous low birth weight infants, parity, weight at mid-pregnancy, and total weight gain during pregnancy. Among smokers, the smallest infants were born to mothers having the greatest decrease in plasma carotene between 19-36 weeks' gestation. Smokers whose plasma carotene remained constant or increased had larger infants; a similar association was not observed for cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Women in the treated group gained significantly more weight during their pregnancy than did controls. The treated women also delivered infants who averaged 300 g heavier than those born to the control group, a statistically significant difference. Other factors reported to compromise infant outcome such as ethnic background, income status, age, and smoking did not significantly affect infant birth weight.\r"

The rates of occurrence of the eight most common antenatal complications were determined and compared with their incidence in singleton gestations. In addition, complication rates were related to zygosity, levels of antenatal care, and time of antenatal diagnosis. Twin gestations had an 83% incidence of antenatal complications, in contrast to a 32% incidence in singleton gestations. The increased complication rate was due to the disproportionate increase in three complications: preterm labor, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and fetal death. Other complications did not occur more frequently in twin gestations than in singleton gestations. Monozygotic gestations were more frequently complicated by fetal death, and dizygotic gestations by pregnancy-induced hypertension.\r"

Eighty-five percent of the surviving fetuses were delivered preterm, and the four neonatal deaths were all due to extreme prematurity, with a mean (+/- SEM) birth weight of 794 +/- 237 g. Perinatal mortality was 585 per 1000, 450 for twin A and 750 for twin B. The causes of fetal death varied. Maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation was not diagnosed in any pregnancy in the present series. The high risk of complications related to preterm birth, compared with the low risk of problems related to continuation of a multiple pregnancy after diagnosis of a fetal death, argues in favor of conservative management in this setting.\r"

In this report, arrests of dilatation and descent and prolongation of the decelerative phase of labor were reviewed with respect to the later appearance of brain damage in infants after 2 years of age, in association with obstetric interventions including cesarean birth, forceps, and oxytocin. Charts of 413 infants born after abnormal labors were studied. Log-linear analysis was performed to determine the contribution of method of delivery and oxytocin use to the presence of neurologic abnormalities. Statistical testing ruled out the presence in the model of a three-way interaction, and excluded the two-way interactions of neurologic abnormalities-oxytocin use and neurologic abnormalities-method of delivery. Chi-square tests of partial association and marginal association for the delivery-oxytocin interaction yielded values of 33.54 (P less than .0001) and 33.78 (P less than .00001). This model asserted that method of delivery and use of oxytocin were unrelated to the presence of neurologic abnormalities, but were related to each other.\r"

We were interested in the following questions: 1) Is the relationship between impaired fetal growth and fetal death rate the same at each gestational age? and 2) What birth weight would result in a quadrupling of the fetal death rate at each gestational age? Using exponential regression analysis, we determined for each gestational age the fetal death rate at the modal birth weight and similarly, the birth weight expected to result in a quadrupling of the fetal death rate. As gestational age advanced, the birth weight percentile resulting in the constant outcome also increased (second percentile at 25 weeks; 17th percentile at 42 weeks). We also compared these data with similar data from Denver. The findings indicate the following: 1) Fetal death rate increases exponentially as birth weight decreases at each gestational age; 2) the birth weight percentile that results in a constant outcome is not consistent at each gestational age; and 3) if assessment of risk is to be inferred based on the relationship between birth weight and gestational age, the tenth percentile (whether Denver, Illinois, or elsewhere) does not predict stillbirth accurately. The implications point to the use of outcome-oriented risk assessments to predict fetal death when examining the relationship between birth weight and gestational age.\r"

The logistic regression model identified a group of infants in whom the risk of seizure was approximately one per 100. The risk factors included in the model were antepartum anemia, antepartum bleeding, asthma, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, presentation other than occiput anterior, fetal distress, and shoulder dystocia.

In addition, maternal serum somatomedin C concentrations were determined 1-7 days before delivery. Twenty-five infants born to alcohol-abusing mothers were growth-retarded and also had other signs of fetal alcohol effects, but the remaining 31 infants born to the drinkers and all infants of abstinent mothers were healthy. The somatomedin C levels of infants with fetal alcohol effects (mean +/- SD 4.6 +/- 1.5 nmol/L) were lower (P less than .005) than the levels of healthy infants of drinking (6.8 +/- 4.0 nmol/L) or abstinent (7.1 +/- 3.3 nmol/L) mothers, but the levels did not correlate with infant birth weight, placental weight, or fetal GH or maternal somatomedin C levels. Alcohol drinking was not associated with any changes in maternal somatomedin C levels. The GH levels of infants with fetal alcohol effects (25.4 +/- 22.6 ng/mL) were elevated (P less than .01) when compared with those of infants of abstinent mothers (13.1 +/- 5.3 ng/mL), but did not differ from those of healthy infants of drinking mothers (19.9 +/- 15.1 ng/mL). Low somatomedin C levels and high GH levels in infants born to the drinkers suggest a disharmony in the regulation of the synthesis and/or release of these growth factors, which may be of importance in alcohol-induced fetal damage.\r"

Two cases resulted in death of the newborn; the other five patients recovered after peritoneal dialysis. Because the relative frequency of normal outcomes is unknown, these data are insufficient for incidence-rate estimates or risk/benefit analyses. However, given the potential neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with late-pregnancy exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alternative therapies in the third trimester should be given consideration. If these drugs must be used in this context, the clinician should be prepared to deal with renal failure and hypotension in the newborn. The Food and Drug Administration invites reports of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with such exposure.\r"

Lipid-associated sialic acid levels that increased by 25% or by five units predicted recurrence or rapid progression in three of six patients in an average of 5 weeks, and a 50% elevation in NB/70K predicted recurrence in two of three patients by 5 and 3 weeks before clinical confirmation. Although the number of patients in this series is small, preoperative elevated tumor markers in patients known to have uterine papillary serous carcinoma correlate closely with the presence of extrauterine disease. This information should influence surgical management and may be useful in postsurgical treatment assessment.\r"

Vaginal bleeding was the most frequent presenting symptom, followed by abdominal mass and pelvic pain. Long-term survival was found only in those cases in which the tumor was localized to the uterus (surgical stage I), particularly if it arose from a benign endometrial polyp. No correlation could be established between survival and tumor size, depth of myometrial invasion, or histologic type of sarcoma. Tumors arising after previous irradiation had a poor prognosis. Treatment included surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The cumulative probability of 5-year survival was 35%.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred three patients (median age 26 years; range 18-45) with untreated multiple and widespread anogenital condyloma were randomly assigned to one of four study arms in order to compare the efficacy, toxicity, and tolerability of recombinant interferon alpha-2b with those of diathermocoagulation. Of 200 evaluable patients, 51 were treated intramuscularly (IM) with 3 x 10(6) U (3 MU)/m2 daily for 3 weeks (total dose 63 MU/m2), 50 received subcutaneous thrice-weekly injections of 3 MU/m2 for 4 weeks (total dose 36 MU/m2), 51 underwent diathermocoagulation, and 48 were not treated and were used as a control group. Six months after the end of treatment, the overall response rate (complete and partial responses) was 70%: 57 and 82% for patients receiving interferon alpha-2b (IM and subcutaneously) and diathermocoagulation, respectively, and 8% for the control group. After 6 months from therapy, no significant differences in complete response were found among the different types of treatment: 20, 20, and 35% for the two interferon groups and the diathermocoagulation group, respectively. Fifteen and two complete responders in the cauterization and interferon groups, respectively, experienced disease recurrence (P less than .01). All patients given interferon therapy complained of flu-like symptoms, which declined progressively after the first week of treatment. Fatigue, lasting as long as patients received interferon, was the most prevalent chronic side effect. We conclude that systemic recombinant interferon alpha-2b is active in treating patients with primary condyloma lesions and does so as well as cauterization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hyperplasia developed in 30 and 57% of the patients who received the above conjugated equine estrogens and placebo regimens, respectively. Irregular, breakthrough bleeding occurred in 14% of the conjugated equine estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate users and in 54% of the conjugated equine estrogens/placebo users. The results of this study indicate that 1 year of therapy with 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens and 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate provided the most satisfactory endometrial protection against hyperplasia and was associated with relatively low rates of breakthrough bleeding.\r"

Specifically, our office nurse conducts evening sessions allowing conversation, questions, voicing of complaints, and a vehicle for feedback from physicians to patients. A feeling of trust in the program and improved relationships with office personnel have resulted, as well as better patient-physician communication. This program can be incorporated easily into an infertility practice.\r"

Detection of the small amounts of HPV DNA in cervical scrapes has been very difficult. The polymerase chain reaction is a new technique that can specifically amplify target DNA to facilitate its detection. We have amplified a region of HPV type 16 DNA using this technique and have shown the method to be both specific and sensitive (a tenfold improvement when compared with Southern blotting). Among 21 cervical scrapes, five from women with normal smears and 16 from women with dyskaryotic smears, HPV 16 DNA was present in scrapes from two women (40%) with normal smears and in scrapes from 12 women (75%) with dyskaryotic smears. The polymerase chain reaction technique is rapid, requires no radioactive probes, and should be the method of choice in future studies to determine the prevalence of HPV infection of the cervix.\r"

Herein, we describe a 35-year-old woman with autoimmune oophoritis who presented with symptoms referable to a right cystic adnexal mass. She underwent a diagnostic laparotomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy for removal of an 8.0-cm-diameter, twisted multicystic ovary. Microscopically, mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrated multiple follicular and luteal cysts. We have seen two additional patients with histologically verified autoimmune oophoritis who underwent diagnostic laparotomy and oophorectomy because of cystic enlargement of the ovaries. Stimulation of ovarian follicles by elevated levels of pituitary gonadotropins probably causes the cystic changes. Recognition of this aspect of autoimmune oophoritis may help to prevent oophorectomy in patients whose functioning ovarian tissue is already compromised by autoimmune destruction.\r"

Intraocular pressure significantly decreased from week 1 of treatment and persisted within normal limits until week 8 in glaucomatocyclitic crisis. Similarly, intraocular pressure decreased significantly from week 2 in other forms of uveitis. Intraocular pressure was well controlled in patients with open-angle glaucoma, but the control was insufficient in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. No adverse reactions such as systemic hemodynamic effects or exacerbations of intraocular inflammation were observed during this study.

Approximately 70% of tumors induced in BR6 mice by mouse mammary tumor virus have proviral insertions adjacent to the int-2 gene. We find that the murine homolog of the hst/k-FGF gene can also be transcriptionally activated by the insertion of mouse mammary tumor virus DNA either upstream or downstream of the gene. In most tumors, only one of these adjacent genes is activated, but in some cases both genes are expressed. One of the hst-expressing tumors also has a virally activated int-3 gene. At least five distinct cellular genes (int-1, -2, -3, -4, and hst/k-FGF) can therefore contribute, either singly or in concert, to the development of histologically indistinguishable mammary tumors in mice infected by mouse mammary tumor virus.\r"

  ".U": "89345532\r", 
  ".W": "Escherichia coli that carry a recombinant plasmid bearing the Vibrio fischeri lux regulon express luminescence that mimics the luminescence of V. fischeri. The lux regulon consists of two divergently transcribed operons, the rightward operon (luxICDABE genes) and the leftward operon (luxR gene). The luxR and luxI genes and the control region separating the two operons supply the primary regulatory control over the lux regulon; the regulatory mechanisms result in a dramatic increase in the rate of luciferase synthesis after induction, apparently due to a unique autoregulatory positive feedback mechanism, and in an enormous difference (greater than 10(4] in levels of luminescence in cells before and after induction. The generally accepted model of primary regulation of bioluminescence in V. fischeri involves the interaction of the product of the luxR gene and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)homoserine lactone, the autoinducer produced by the enzyme encoded by luxI, the first gene of the rightward operon, with an operator sequence within the control region to stimulate transcription of the rightward operon in a positive feedback loop. We have used deletion mapping of a transcription reporter vector to determine the approximate location of the operator. By site-directed mutagenesis of the presumed operator, we have demonstrated that the 20-base-pair inverted repeat ACCTGTAGGA/TCGTA CAGGT (where the vertical line is the center of symmetry), which bears striking similarity to the recognition sequence for the pleiotropic repressor protein LexA, is the operator of the lux regulon. We also found that deletion of sequences upstream of the palindrome leads to increased transcription from the rightward promoter (PR), indicative of a cis-acting element that represses transcription in the absence of the LuxR-autoinducer complex. Modifications of the palindrome that eliminate stimulation by LuxR-autoinducer of transcription from PR have no effect on repression by the cis-acting mechanism(s), suggesting that the palindrome is not necessary for repression of the rightward operon. Thus, it appears that the large increase in transcription upon induction of the lux regulon is the result of at least two independent mechanisms, one positive and the other negative.\r"

The nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment was used to assign the aromatic and C1'H DNA protons and to identify drug-DNA contacts. These data indicate that two drug molecules bind simultaneously in the minor groove of the central 5'-AAATT-3' segment and are in close contact with both the DNA and one another. One drug binds with the formyl end close to the second adenine base of the A-rich strand, while the other drug binds with the formyl end close to the second adenine of the complementary strand. With this binding orientation, the positively charged propylamidinium groups are directed toward opposite ends of the helix. Molecular modeling shows that the minor groove must expand relative to the 1:1 complex to accommodate both drugs. Energy calculations suggest that electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces contribute to the stability of the complex.\r"

In addition, an open reading frame overlaps the 3' end of POL, in the region that encodes viral infectivity factor in the primate viruses. Several short open reading frames are present in the intergenic region between POL and ENV and within ENV, which may serve as exons for production of TAT and REV equivalents in FIV.

For beta tubulin, the initial recognition event for this selective RNA instability has previously been shown to be a cotranslational binding (presumably by tubulin itself) to the nascent amino-terminal beta-tubulin tetrapeptide just after it emerges from the ribosome. Although this \"autoregulation\" of tubulin expression is thus obligatorily linked to the translation process, the mechanism of how a cotranslational protein-protein binding event ultimately triggers RNA degradation is unknown. Using protein synthesis inhibitors to slow and ultimately to block translation elongation, we now show that the mRNA destabilization pathway requires ongoing ribosome translocation.\r"

Deformation of the vesicles requires that the actin filaments be on average at least approximately 0.5 micron long as shown by the effects of gelsolin, an actin filament-nucleating protein. Filamin, a filament-crosslinking protein, caused the surfaces of the vesicles to have a smoother appearance. Heterogeneous distribution of actin filaments within the vesicles is caused by interfilament interactions and modulated by gelsolin and filamin.

  ".W": "The addition of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) to neutrophils causes an increase in cytoskeletal actin, a rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium, release of arachidonic acid, and the synthesis of PAF. The PAF synthesis in human neutrophils stimulated by PAF is greatly potentiated by the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Incubation of human neutrophils with the tumor copromoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 3 min prior to the addition of the stimulus inhibits all these responses produced by PAF. The inhibition is prevented when the cells are incubated with protein kinase C inhibitors such as 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine for 5 min prior to the addition of PMA. The rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium in human neutrophils stimulated with leukotriene B4 is also inhibited by PMA, and this inhibition is prevented by protein kinase C inhibitors such as staurosporine. Unlike PMA, the inactive ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate has no inhibitory effect on the stimulated rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium. The binding of either PAF or leukotriene B4 to intact cells is inhibited by PMA. The most important finding of the present studies is that PMA interferes with the binding of PAF and leukotriene B4 to their respective receptors. Whether PMA inhibits the binding of these lipid mediators by activating protein kinase C or by perturbing the membrane directly remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "All cellular cytoplasmic mRNAs carry a 7-methylguanylate cap attached to their 5' ends. This cap structure is recognized by cap-binding proteins that then direct the binding of ribosomal subunits to this 5'-end complex. Poliovirus, a plus-stranded RNA virus, interferes with this cellular translation process by proteolytically inactivating the cap-binding protein complex. Subsequently the viral mRNA can be translated by an initiation process in which ribosomes bind internally to the mRNA [Pelletier, J. & Sonenberg, N. (1988) Nature (London) 334, 320-325], obviating cap-dependent translation. At least one cellular mRNA, encoding a heat shock-like protein, glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein, has been discovered to be translated at an increased rate in poliovirus-infected cells at a time when the translation of other cellular mRNAs is inhibited. The glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein mRNA thus exemplifies a cellular mRNA that is translated at a specifically enhanced rate by an as-yet-unresolved cap-independent initiation process in cells when the cap-binding protein complex is not functional.\r"

The technique of \"rapid amplification of cDNA ends\" has been used to extend the 5' end of this open reading frame to a potential transcription initiation site that is preceded by 320 bp of an apparently untranslated region. The protein predicted by the resulting nucleotide sequence has a Mr of 32,960 and contains four regions that show close homology with four alpha-chymotryptic digestion fragments of the alpha chain. The amino acid composition of the alpha chain of Cap Z and the predicted protein are also similar. Northern blot analysis of whole chicken embryos shows two mRNA species of 1.9 and 2.4 kilobases, respectively, that hybridize with CE2. Three potential polyadenylylation signals in two regions of CE2 460 bp apart are identified, suggesting that the two messages may result from the use of alternative polyadenylylation sites. Comparison of the sequence data with that of other known actin-capping and severing proteins shows no significant homologies, suggesting that Cap Z may be a member of a unique group of capping, nonsevering proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a recently described cell-surface protein of 4544 amino acids that contains reiterated sequences found in the 839-amino acid receptor for low density lipoprotein (LDL). In the current studies, we purified LRP from rat liver, prepared polyclonal antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain, and demonstrated an immunoreactive protein of approximately 600 kDa in human fibroblasts. The function of this LRP was studied in mutant human fibroblasts that do not produce LDL receptors. The mutant cells were incubated with beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) that was isolated from cholesterol-fed rabbits and artificially enriched with apoprotein (apo) E by incubation in vitro with human apo E produced in a bacterial expression system. The apo E-enriched beta-VLDL, but not unincubated beta-VLDL, stimulated incorporation of [14C]-oleate into cholesteryl [14C]oleate 20- to 40-fold in the mutant cells. This stimulation was blocked by chloroquine, suggesting that such stimulation resulted from receptor-mediated uptake and lysosomal hydrolysis of the cholesteryl esters in apo E-enriched beta-VLDL. Stimulation of cholesterol esterification was blocked by the antibody against LRP, but not by an antibody against the LDL receptor. Unlike the LDL receptor, the amount of LRP was not reduced when cells were incubated with oxygenated sterols. We conclude that LRP can mediate the cellular uptake and lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters contained in lipoproteins that are enriched in apo E.\r"

  ".U": "89345557\r", 
  ".W": "The rates of the quenching and recovery of tryptophan fluorescence are determined in the microsecond-millisecond time scale during the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin under different perturbations. The kinetics suggest the presence of two quenching processes, a rapid one (on the time scale of photocycle intermediate L550 formation or faster) and a slow one (slightly slower than the slow component of intermediate M412 formation). The slow quenching process is found to respond to different perturbations in the same manner as the slow component of M412 formation. It has the same activation energy, it is inhibited if metal cations are removed, it is negligible at pH values greater than the pKa of tyrosine, and its rate is slowed down when 75% of the lipids are removed. These results, together with the observed value of the quenching activation energy, suggest that the rates of the tryptophan fluorescence quenching, like those of tyrosinate and M412 formations during the cycle, are all determined by the rates of the protein conformation changes. The pH studies of the slow quenching process show that the maximum quenching probability occurs at neutral pH. A rapid decrease in quenching occurs at lower pH (approximately 3 and approximately 5.5) and higher pH (approximately 9). Two quenching mechanisms involving energy transfer to either retinal or to tyrosinate are considered. Protein conformation changes resulting from a change in the ionization state of amino acids of different pKa values could change the tryptophan-retinal (or tryptophan-tyrosinate) coupling and thus the quenching efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable attention has recently been drawn to the hypothesis that enzymes catalyze their reactions by displacing solvent and creating an environment similar to the gas phase for the reacting substrates. This \"desolvation hypothesis\" is reexamined in this paper by defining a common reference energy for reactions in various environments. It is argued that consistent attempts to describe the actual energetics of enzymatic reactions, taking either gas phase or solution as a reference, would contradict the above hypothesis. That is, the enzyme does remove water molecules from its substrate, but substitutes these molecules for another polar environment (namely, its active site). By taking amide hydrolysis as an example, we use experimentally estimated solvation energies and analyze the reaction profile in the gas phase, in solution, and in enzyme active sites. We show that the gas-phase reaction is characterized by an enormous activation barrier (associated with forming the charged nucleophile from neutral fragments), although the nucleophilic attack is essentially barrierless. On the other hand, the enzyme and solution reactions are found to have similar reaction profiles, with a lower activation barrier for the enzymatic reaction. Presumably, the fact that previous analyses of this problem did not involve the construction of the relevant thermodynamic cycles (and quantitative estimates of the corresponding solvation energies) led to the desolvation hypothesis. Our conclusion is that enzyme active sites provide specific polar environments that do not resemble the gas phase but that are designed for electrostatic stabilization of ionic transition states and that \"solvate\" these states more than water does.\r"

The equivalent size of each phospholipid headgroup was approximated by the net atomic volume plus the volume of the associated water molecules, which was derived from water/hydrocarbon partitioning experiments. The equivalent lengths of unsaturated acyl chains were derived from the retention time data from chromatographic measurements. The spontaneous curvature of various phospholipid monolayers was calculated from their equivalent molecular shapes, and the energy required to flatten them to the bilayer plane was calculated, using the known bending modulus. With increasing bending energy, the mixtures showed increasing susceptibility to phospholipase A2, facilitated lipid transfer rate by phospholipid exchange proteins, permeability to carboxyfluorescein, incorporation of human erythrocyte proteins, and calcium transport by Ca-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum in reconstituted vesicles. When the calculation was applied to known lipid compositions of nine cellular membranes, the protein/lipid ratio and phospholipid/cholesterol ratio were found to have a positive and a negative correlation, respectively, with the latent bending energy of the phospholipids. The energy expense in conforming to a bilayer phase may be an important physical parameter regarding the activity and the biogenesis of membranes.\r"

These changes were observed during normal erythrocyte aging in situ. Binding of ankyrin to band 3 was normal. Serum/cell crossover studies indicated that a neoantigen appears on the propositus' erythrocytes to which IgG from both propositus and control serum binds as measured with a protein A binding assay. IgG eluted from the propositus' erythrocytes appeared to have a specificity for senescent cell antigen as determined by a phagocytosis inhibition assay. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that antibodies to band 3, which do not normally bind to intact erythrocytes, bound to the propositus' erythrocytes. Antibody 980 binds to normal old cells but not young or middle-aged cells. It also binds to a distinct region of band 3 in immunoblots of membranes from the propositus' middle-aged cells. Cells from both of the propositus' parents exhibited increased IgG binding and altered anion and glucose transport. The results of these studies suggest that (i) band 3 is aging prematurely in erythrocytes from the propositus, (ii) senescent cell antigen appears on the propositus' middle-aged red cells, and (iii) band 3 alterations observed in the propositus may have a genetic component.\r"

Nuclear extracts prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with an expression vector for the nuclear RA receptors RAR alpha or RAR beta were enriched (20- to 100-fold) with a RA-binding activity that coeluted by size-exclusion HPLC with the putative RAR from HL-60 cells. The HL-60 nuclear receptor exhibited high-affinity binding of RA and its benzoic acid analogs Ch55, Ch30, Ro 13-7410, and SRI 6409-40 and low-affinity binding of retinol, Ro 8-8717, and SRI 5442-60, correlating well with the biological activity of these compounds in HL-60 cells. Saturation binding and Scatchard plot analyses of the binding of RA to the nuclear HL-60 receptor yielded an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 0.46 nM and 1400 +/- 100 receptor sites per cell. Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ RNA with cDNA probes specific for RAR alpha and RAR beta indicated that HL-60 cells contain predominantly transcripts encoded by the RAR alpha gene. Our results suggest that the observed nuclear RA-binding activity in HL-60 cells might mediate the action of RA in these cells.\r"

These tumor-elicited PMNs (tcPMNs) secrete high levels of the basement-membrane-degrading enzymes, type IV collagenase and heparanase, suggesting that metastatic tumor cells stimulate neutrophilia so that the tcPMNs might assist tumor cell extravasation during metastasis. To test this hypothesis, purified proteose peptone-elicited PMNs from peritoneal exudate, circulating normal PMNs, and tcPMNs were evaluated for their effects on in vitro invasive and in vivo metastatic potentials of syngeneic 13762NF mammary adenocarcinoma tumor cells. tcPMNs caused a dose-dependent increase in invasion through a reconstituted basement membrane barrier in an in vitro invasion assay. At PMN:tumor cell ratios of 30:1, invasion potential significantly (P less than 0.05) rose to 26-fold, 40-fold, and 37-fold for poorly metastatic MTLn2 cells, highly metastatic MTLn3 cells, and moderately metastatic MTF7 cells, respectively. In contrast, purified proteose peptone-elicited PMNs and circulating normal PMNs did not significantly alter invasive potential. Intravenous coinjections of purified proteose peptone-elicited PMNs did not change the number of experimental lung metastases, but tcPMNs at ratios to 50:1 significantly raised the mean number of metastases 23-fold for MTLn2, 3- to 4-fold for MTLn3, and 1.6- to 1.8-fold for MTF7. These results demonstrate that tcPMNs contribute to the metastatic propensity of mammary adenocarcinoma clones by increasing efficiency of invasion through basement membrane.\r"

  ".W": "The only known role for 6(R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is as the cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. However, BH4 has been shown to be synthesized by cells that do not contain any hydroxylase activity, suggesting that it may have still undiscovered functions. Our finding of much higher levels of BH4 and GTP cyclohydrolase, the first enzyme of de novo BH4 biosynthesis, in rat reticulocytes compared to mature erythrocytes raised the possibility that BH4 might play a role in erythrocyte maturation. We have now demonstrated, by using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells as a model for erythrogenesis, that BH4 synthesis is required for proliferation of these cells. Inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis in rapidly dividing MEL cells with N-acetylserotonin, a potent inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase, the terminal enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and mitogenesis without induction of hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of DNA synthesis is reversed by repletion of cellular BH4 levels with sepiapterin, a pterin that is readily taken up by the cells and converted to BH4 by the sequential reductions of sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment of MEL cells with hexamethylene bisacetamide, an inducer of differentiation, results in a decrease in BH4 synthesis accompanied by a cessation of growth and concomitant hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of proliferation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide can be reversed by maintaining high intracellular levels of BH4, which also decreases the amount of hemoglobin. The mechanism of the BH4 effect has not yet been elucidated, but it appears as though BH4 synthesis is more intimately linked with cell proliferation than with the differentiation process.\r"

  ".W": "We provide evidence that the quasispecies nature (extreme genetic heterogeneity) of foot-and-mouth disease virus is relevant to the virus evading an immune response. A monoclonal antibody neutralizing the viral infectivity (clone SD6) recognizes an epitope located around a highly conserved sequence (amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Leu-Ala at positions 141-145) in the capsid protein VP1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus of serotype C1. The amino acid substitutions Ala-138----Thr and Leu-147----Ile (or ----Val) reduced 100-fold the binding titer of monoclonal antibody SD6 to virions or to VP1. The effect of those substitutions was quantitatively reproduced with synthetic peptides representing the relevant sequences. This provides evidence that the two chemically conservative amino acids replacements--and not other substitutions present in the virus quasispecies--are responsible for the modified interaction with neutralizing monoclonal antibody SD6. The three substitutions were fixed in the viral capsid during one occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease and, furthermore, they are of a type found frequently among independent foot-and-mouth disease virus isolates. The results implicate the extreme heterogeneity of foot-and-mouth disease virus as an important element of viral pathogenesis.\r"

The predicted sequence alteration was confirmed by DNA sequencing in all five patients and indicated a likely disease-causing mutation in four of these patients. In one atypical ornithine transcarbamoylase-deficient patient a sequence alteration compatible with a cDNA polymorphism was found. One family was studied in detail. Female-carrier detection was performed by chemical cleavage of amplified genomic DNA and verified by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization.

The extensive phenotypic overlap between WS and normal aging suggests they may also share pathogenetic mechanisms. We reported previously that somatic cells from WS patients demonstrate a propensity to develop chromosomal aberrations, including translocations, inversions, and deletions, and that WS cell lines demonstrate a high spontaneous mutation rate to 6-thioguanine resistance. We report here the biochemical and molecular characterization of spontaneous mutations at the X chromosome-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in 6-thioguanine-resistant WS and control cells. Blot hybridization analysis of 89 independent spontaneous HPRT mutations in WS and control mutants lacking HPRT activity revealed an unusually high proportion of HPRT deletions in WS as compared with control cells (76% vs. 39%). Approximately half (58%) of the deletions in WS cells consisted of the loss of greater than 20 kilobases of DNA from the HPRT gene. These results suggest that an elevated somatic mutation rate, and particularly deletions, may play pathogenetically important roles in WS and in several associated age-dependent human disease processes.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue-specific genetic variation in expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase, encoded by the Adh-1 gene, is found between C57BL/6J (B6) mice and B6.S congenic mice. B6.S mice contain a variant Adh-1 allele derived from a wild Danish strain in a B6 genetic background. B6 mice have nearly twice the alcohol dehydrogenase activity in liver but less than half the activity in kidney as B6.S mice. These tissue-specific genetic changes in alcohol dehydrogenase expression are manifest at the level of Adh-1-encoded mRNA. The regulatory site(s) involved act cis in both kidney and liver. These strains also differ in the extent to which androgen induces mRNA encoded by kidney Adh-1, with androgen increasing these levels 17-fold and 7.4-fold in the B6 and B6.S kidney, respectively. To identify the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying this strain variation in Adh-1 transcription in the B6 and B6.S kidney, liver, and androgen-induced kidney. For both uninduced and induced kidney, a difference in the transcription rate alone accounts for the strain difference in mRNA concentration. In contrast, because the Adh-1 transcription rate in liver does not differ significantly between B6 and B6.S mice, strain-specific variation in posttranscriptional regulation must be operative. Taken together these results indicate that the variation in Adh-1 expression between B6 and B6.S mice results from changes in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control, and these controls are differentially operative in kidney and liver.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we demonstrated that chronic energy intake restriction (CEIR) by a diet relatively low in fat, relatively high in carbohydrate, and reduced 40% in total calories extends life span and delays development of autoimmune disease in autoimmunity-prone mice. To investigate a possible cellular basis for this dramatic action of CEIR, we analyzed the rate of incorporation of [3H]thymidine by cells of the intestinal epithelium, thymus, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes in ad libitum-fed mice vs. CEIR mice of three autoimmunity-prone strains. In New Zealand Black (NZB), MRL/MP-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr), and BXSB mice, CEIR slowed the rate of uptake of [3H]thymidine and, by inference, the rate of cellular proliferation among epithelial cells along the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, CEIR decreased the apparent proliferative rate of lymphoid cells of the thymus, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes. This action by CEIR on the proliferative rate of cells of these rapidly replicating cell populations may point to an important mechanism by which calorie restriction inhibits the development of autoimmune disease and extends longevity in autoimmunity-prone mice.\r"

It consists of the exposed residues of an alpha-helix together with surrounding amino acids. The epitope crosses the active-site cleft and includes a tryptophan located within this cleft. The combining site of the antibody is mostly flat with a protuberance made up of two tyrosines that penetrate the cleft. All six complementarity-determining regions of the Fab contribute at least one residue to the binding; one residue from the framework is also in contact with the lysozyme. The contacting residues on the antibody contain a disproportionate number of aromatic side chains. The antibody-antigen contact mainly involves hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions; there is one ion-pair interaction but it is weak.\r"

By means of pulsed-field gel analysis and with the knowledge of regional mapping of the probes D21S17, D21S55 and ETS2, we estimated the size of the common duplicated region to be between 400 and 3000 kilobases.

For example, survival from Friend virus-induced leukemia is significantly prolonged by both compounds, with hypericin showing the greater potency. Viremia induced by LP-BM5 murine immunodeficiency virus is markedly suppressed after infrequent dosage of either substance. These compounds affect the retroviral infection and replication cycle at least at two different points: (i) Assembly or processing of intact virions from infected cells was shown to be affected by hypericin. Electron microscopy of hypericin-treated, virus-producing cells revealed the production of particles containing immature or abnormally assembled cores, suggesting the compounds may interfere with processing of gag-encoded precursor polyproteins. The released virions contain no detectable activity of reverse transcriptase. (ii) Hypericin and pseudohypericin also directly inactivate mature and properly assembled retroviruses as determined by assays for reverse transcriptase and infectivity. Accumulating data from our laboratories suggest that these compounds inhibit retroviruses by unconventional mechanisms and that the potential therapeutic value of hypericin and pseudohypericin should be explored in diseases such as AIDS.\r"

TNF-alpha treatment of ACH2 cells resulted in an increase in steady-state levels of HIV RNA and HIV transcription. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) by TNF-alpha was associated with the induction of a nuclear factor(s) binding to the NF-kappa B sites in the LTR. Deletion of the NF-kappa B sites from the LTR eliminated activation by TNF-alpha in T cells transfected with plasmids in which the HIV LTR directed the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Thus, TNF-alpha appears to activate HIV RNA and virus production by ACH2 cells through the induction of transcription-activating factors that bind to the NF-kappa B sequences in the HIV LTR.\r"

The polymerase reaction products hybridized to the 6-kilobase RNA, believed to be the viral genome.

  ".W": "Renal medullary cells contain high concentrations of myo-inositol, sorbitol, betaine, and glycerophosphocholine, whose levels vary with urinary osmolality. Accumulation of these \"compatible\" organic osmolytes is believed to help the cells osmoregulate in response to the high extracellular osmolality that occurs as part of the urinary concentrating mechanism. MDCK cells (a line from dog kidney) were previously shown to accumulate myo-inositol in response to increased medium osmolality. We demonstrate here that this accumulation requires the presence of myo-inositol in the medium, implying that the myo-inositol is not synthesized by the cells but rather is transported into them from the extracellular solution. The MDCK cells contain sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporters. Relative to isotonic controls, sodium-dependent myo-inositol uptake is higher in cells exposed to increased osmolality either acutely (1-7 days) or chronically (greater than 1 year). Transport is further enhanced when the cells are cultured in myo-inositol-free medium. The transport has both high- and low-affinity components. The observed changes in transport involve changes in maximal velocity of the high-affinity component but not in its Km. We conclude that renal cells can osmoregulate by changing the number (or, less likely, the transport turnover rate) of functioning sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporters.\r"

Renal cysts derive from nephrons and collecting ducts and progressively enlarge as a consequence of epithelial proliferation and transepithelial fluid secretion. The initiation of cyst formation and the factors that control cyst enlargement are unknown. We used an in vitro model of renal cysts to explore the role of the cAMP signal transduction system in the formation and expansion of cysts. MDCK cells, cultured in hydrated-collagen gel, produced polarized monolayered epithelial cysts when intracellular cAMP was increased by prostaglandin E1, arginine vasopressin, cholera toxin, forskolin, or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. All agonists were potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cell proliferation component of cyst enlargement was accelerated by cAMP agonists, as shown by the increased growth of MDCK cells in subconfluent monolayers. The fluid secretion component, reflected by the transepithelial movement of fluid across polarized monolayers of MDCK cells grown on permeable supports, was stimulated by cAMP agonists in the basolateral medium. Chloride levels were higher in the cyst fluid and the secreted fluid than in the bathing medium. We conclude that the development of MDCK cysts is dependent on cAMP. This signal transduction system may be an important modulator of epithelial cell proliferation and transepithelial fluid secretion in the kidney.\r"

Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays further reveal that the H2A modulator contains at least two binding sites [upstream sequence elements 1 and 2 (USE 1 and USE 2)] for nuclear factors extracted from sea urchin embryos, which actively transcribe the early histone gene set. Interestingly, USE 1 is highly homologous to a cis-acting element previously identified in the H2A modulator of Psammechinus miliaris [Grosschedl, R., Machler, M., Rohrer, U. & Birnstiel, M. L. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 8123-8136]. Finally, a cloned oligonucleotide containing the USE 1 sequence competes efficiently in Xenopus oocytes with the H2A modulator to prevent enhancement of transcription of the reporter gene. From these results, we conclude that USE 1 and perhaps USE 2 in the H2A modulator are upstream transcriptional elements that are recognized by trans-acting factors common to Xenopus and sea urchin.\r"

In addition to the snRNP proteins B', B, D, D', E, F, and G, which are present in each of the major snRNPs U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5, U5 snRNP contains a number of unique proteins characterized by apparent molecular masses of 40, 52, 100, 102, 116, and 200 (mostly a double band) kDa. The latter set of proteins may be regarded as U5-specific for the following reasons. They are not only eluted specifically, together with snRNP particles, from anti-2,2,7-trimethylguanosine immunoaffinity columns by 7-methylguanosine, they also cofractionate with U5 snRNP during chromatography and, most importantly, in glycerol gradient centrifugation. These U5 snRNP particles show a high sedimentation constant of about 20S. U5 snRNPs that lack the U5-specific proteins are also found in nuclear extracts but have (in comparison) a lower sedimentation value of only 8-10S. Autoimmune sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were identified that, on immunoblots with purified U5 snRNP proteins, reacted selectively with the 100- or 200-kDa proteins. This indicates that at least the high molecular mass U5-specific proteins are structurally distinct and not derived one from the other by proteolytic degradation. The existence of so many unique proteins in the U5 snRNP suggests that this snRNP particle may exert its function during splicing mainly by virtue of its protein components.\r"

The cDNA is identical to that encoding the 53-kDa glycoprotein except that it contains an in-frame insertion of 1308 nucleotides near its 5' end, apparently resulting from alternative splicing. The protein encoded by the cDNA would contain a 19-residue NH2-terminal signal sequence and a 453-residue COOH-terminal sequence identical to the 53-kDa glycoprotein. It would also contain a 436-amino acid insert between these sequences. This insert would be highly acidic, suggesting that it might bind Ca2+. The purified 160-kDa glycoprotein and the glycoprotein expressed in COS-1 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the 160-kDa glycoprotein were shown to bind 45Ca2+ in a gel overlay assay. The protein was shown to be located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and to be associated through Ca2+ with the membrane. We propose that this lumenal Ca2+ binding glycoprotein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum be designated \"sarcalumenin.\"\r"

We have also identified the structural change in five other alloalbumin specimens detected during clinical electrophoresis of sera from Japanese living near Tokyo. Each of the five albumin variants from Nagasaki and Hiroshima has a single amino acid substitution. All of these substitutions differ, and none has been reported in non-Japanese populations. No instances of proalbumin variants or of albumin B (the most frequent alloalbumins in Caucasians) were detected in the children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, one instance of a variant proalbumin and two examples of albumin B occurred in Japanese from the vicinity of Tokyo. In addition a previously unreported point substitution was found in albumin Tochigi, which is present in two unrelated persons from Tochigi prefecture. Four of the point mutations in the Japanese alloalbumins are in close proximity in a short segment of the polypeptide chain (residues 354-382) in which three additional point substitutions have been reported in diverse populations. These results, combined with earlier data, suggest that point substitutions are grouped in certain segments of the albumin molecule.\r"

The T7 transcripts, which account for as much as 30% of the total cytoplasmic RNA at 24 hr after infection, are largely uncapped. To improve the translatability of the uncapped RNA, the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) untranslated region (UTR) was inserted between the T7 promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Experiments with a reticulocyte extract demonstrated that the EMCV UTR conferred efficient and cap-independent translatability to CAT RNA synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. In cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the T7 promoter-regulated CAT gene, the EMCV UTR increased the amount of CAT RNA on polyribosomes. The polyribosome-derived CAT RNA, which contained the EMCV UTR, was translated in vitro in a cap-independent fashion as well. Use of the EMCV UTR significantly enhanced the vaccinia/T7 hybrid expression system as it resulted in a 4- to 7-fold increase in total CAT activity. A further approximately 2-fold improvement was achieved by incubating the cells in hypertonic medium, which favors the translation of uncapped picornavirus RNA over cellular mRNAs. With this newly modified expression system, CAT was the predominant protein synthesized by infected cells and within 24 hr accounted for greater than 10% of the total cell protein.\r"

Cellobiohydrolase I mRNA was undetectable when antibodies to the major members of the cellulolytic system were present in the culture medium prior to the addition of cellulose. These antibodies had no repressive effect if sophorose was used as an inducer. The results strongly suggest that a low constitutive cellulolytic system catalyzes the formation of a soluble inducer from cellulose and that this inducer triggers the expression of the cellobiohydrolase I gene transcript, most probably at the transcription level.\r"

  ".W": "Because myosin thick filaments form in the actin-rich cortex of nonmuscle cells, we have examined the role of Dictyostelium actin filaments in the assembly of Dictyostelium myosin (type II). Fluorescence energy transfer and light-scattering assembly assays indicate that self-association of Dictyostelium myosin into bipolar thick filaments is kinetically regulated by actin filament networks. Regulation is nucleotide dependent but does not require ATP hydrolysis. Myosin assembly is accelerated approximately 5-fold by actin filaments when either 1 mM ATP or 1 mM adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate (AMP-P[NH]P) is present. However, actin filaments together with 1 mM ADP abolish myosin assembly. Accelerated assembly appears to require transient binding of myosin molecules to actin filaments before incorporation into thick filaments. Fluorescence energy-transfer assays demonstrate that myosin associates with actin filaments at a rate that is equivalent to the accelerated myosin assembly rate, evidence that myosin to actin binding is a rate-limiting step in accelerated thick filament formation. Actin filament networks are also implicated in regulation of thick filament formation, since fragmentation of F-actin networks by severin causes immediate cessation of accelerated myosin assembly. Electron microscopic studies support a model of actin filament-mediated myosin assembly. In ADP, myosin monomers rapidly decorate F-actin, preventing extensive formation of thick filaments. In AMP-P[NH]P, myosin assembles along actin filaments, forming structures that resemble primitive stress fibers. Taken together, these data suggest a model in which site-directed assembly of thick filaments in Dictyostelium is mediated by the interaction of myosin monomers with cortical actin filament networks.\r"

Like the myosin I molecules from Acanthamoeba, the Dictyostelium myosin I heavy chain is composed of a globular head domain fused to a 45-kDa glycine-, proline-, and alanine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain, rather than the coiled-coil rod domain of conventional myosins. Comparisons of the Dictyostelium myosin I heavy-chain amino acid sequence with those of the Acanthamoeba myosins I reveal that they are highly similar throughout, including the unconventional carboxyl-terminal domains. The Dictyostelium myosin I gene is expressed in growing cells as a 3600-nucleotide mRNA. Measurements of the steady-state level of this mRNA at different times during starvation-induced aggregation and development are consistent with a role for myosin I in chemotaxis and aggregation. Generation of Dictyostelium cells lacking myosin I by gene disruption and/or antisense RNA production should provide a way to test directly the role of this nonfilamentous myosin in cell motility. These experiments will be simplified by the fact that Southern blot analyses of Dictyostelium genomic DNA are consistent with there being a single myosin I heavy-chain gene.\r"

Amplification and direct sequencing were possible using unpurified mtDNA from nanogram samples of fresh specimens and microgram amounts of tissues preserved for months in alcohol or decades in the dry state. The bird and fish sequences evolve with the same strong bias toward transitions that holds for mammals. However, because the light strand of birds is deficient in thymine, thymine to cytosine transitions are less common than in other taxa. Amino acid replacement in a segment of the cytochrome b gene is faster in mammals and birds than in fishes and the pattern of replacements fits the structural hypothesis for cytochrome b. The unexpectedly wide taxonomic utility of these primers offers opportunities for phylogenetic and population research.\r"

We have estimated this date by reconstructing phylogenetic trees from chloroplast DNA sequences, using two independent approaches: the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitution was calibrated from the divergence of maize, wheat, and rice, whereas the rate of nonsynonymous substitution was calibrated from the divergence of angiosperms and bryophytes. Both methods lead to an estimate of the monocot-dicot divergence at 200 million years (Myr) ago (with an uncertainty of about 40 Myr). This estimate is also supported by analyses of the nuclear genes encoding large and small subunit ribosomal RNAs. These results imply that the angiosperm lineage emerged in Jurassic-Triassic time, which considerably predates its appearance in the fossil record (approximately 120 Myr ago). We estimate the divergence between cycads and angiosperms to be approximately 340 Myr, which can be taken as an upper bound for the age of angiosperms.\r"

  ".W": "The analysis of DNA for the presence of particular mutations or polymorphisms can be readily accomplished by differential hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The in vitro DNA amplification technique, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has facilitated the use of these probes by greatly increasing the number of copies of target DNA in the sample prior to hybridization. In a conventional assay with immobilized PCR product and labeled oligonucleotide probes, each probe requires a separate hybridization. Here we describe a method by which one can simultaneously screen a sample for all known allelic variants at an amplified locus. In this format, the oligonucleotides are given homopolymer tails with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase, spotted onto a nylon membrane, and covalently bound by UV irradiation. Due to their long length, the tails are preferentially bound to the nylon, leaving the oligonucleotide probe free to hybridize. The target segment of the DNA sample to be tested is PCR-amplified with biotinylated primers and then hybridized to the membrane containing the immobilized oligonucleotides under stringent conditions. Hybridization is detected nonradioactively by binding of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to the biotinylated DNA, followed by a simple colorimetric reaction. This technique has been applied to HLA-DQA genotyping (six types) and to the detection of Mediterranean beta-thalassemia mutations (nine alleles).\r"

The monomer units are organized as distinct subsets, each characterized by a multimeric higher-order repeat unit that is tandemly reiterated and represents a recent unit of amplification. We have cloned, characterized, and determined the sequence of two beta satellite higher-order repeat units: one located on chromosome 9, the other on the acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) and perhaps other sites in the genome. Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis reveals that these tandem arrays are localized in large domains (50-300 kilobase pairs) that are marked by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. In total, beta satellite sequences comprise several million base pairs of DNA in the human genome. Analysis of this DNA family should permit insights into the nature of chromosome-specific and nonspecific modes of satellite DNA evolution and provide useful tools for probing the molecular organization and concerted evolution of the acrocentric chromosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Several tumors have been reported to down-regulate expression of their class I major histocompatibility molecules, potentially altering their immune recognition. To investigate this phenomenon, we are using various sublines isolated from the S49 lymphoma of the BALB/c mouse strain. These S49 tumor sublines were previously found to have shut off expression of their Kd, Dd, and/or Ld class I molecules in a locus-specific manner. Extensive Southern blot analyses indicated that there were no major chromosome aberrancies in these S49 sublines, and analyses of steady-state class I mRNA suggested that a form of transcriptional regulation was responsible for their variant class I expression. In this report, we characterize the nature of this locus-specific regulation of class I in S49 cells by producing somatic cell hybrids. Three phenotypically distinct S49 sublines were each fused to tumor cells with normal class I expression, and several of the resulting hybrids were analyzed. In every case, the class I molecules expressed by the hybrids were an exact composite of the two fusion partners. Thus, these fusions failed to rescue expression of the Kd, Dd, and/or Ld molecules shut off within each of the S49 tumor sublines. These findings indicate that this locus-specific shutoff of class I expression results from a cis-acting defect and not trans-acting factors. Because the analysis of each of three phenotypically different S49 cells implicated a form of cis-dominant regulation, we hypothesize that a common mechanism generating homologous mutations in class I genes is operative in S49 tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of opioid neuropeptides was shown to stimulate conformational changes and locomotory activity in immunocytes of two representatives of invertebrates as well as in human leukocytes. Cells were examined by use of phase-contrast and Nomarski optics coupled with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and of the Zeiss Videoplan/Vidas Image Analysis system. Immunocompetent blood cells, activated by exogenous opioids or stressful stimuli presumed to engage endogenous opioids, showed flattening, elongation, and formation of pseudopodia. In the mollusc Mytilus edulis, ameboid movements resulted in the formation of cell clusters, an activity not observed in untreated controls, or in immunocytes simultaneously exposed to opioid and naloxone. Tests with nine immunoreactive substances revealed immunocyte stimulation by delta, mu-, kappa-, and epsilon(?)-selective ligands. One of these, [D-Ala2,D-Met5]enkephalinamide (DAMA), active at a concentration of 10 pM, proved to be considerably more effective than the rest. The high pharmacological potency of DAMA, observed in both human and invertebrate immunocytes, sets this opioid apart from the closely related [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, a discrepancy not occurring in the mammalian nervous system. This suggests a specific function for [Met]enkephalin in immunoregulation, mediated perhaps by a special subtype of delta receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A rat hepatoma cell line (Q7) of Morris hepatoma origin was transfected with a construct containing the tandem dimer genome of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the neomycin-resistant selection marker. The culture medium of several neomycin-resistant single-cell clones was found to accumulate high levels of secreted HBV surface antigen and core-related e antigen. HBV-specific replication intermediates, including relaxed circular and single-stranded DNA with a minus-strand polarity, could be found in both the intracellular fraction and the extracellular culture medium by the Southern blot procedure. One of these clones, designated Q7 HBV-21, was characterized in further detail. DNA polymerase activity was present in the virus particles produced by Q7 HBV-21 cells. Characteristic transcripts of HBV, including the 3.5-, 2.5-, and 2.1-kilobase mRNA as well as a core-gene-related transcript of 2.2 kilobases could be detected. Electron microscopic examination of the conditioned medium from Q7 HBV-21 cells identified 42-nm Dane-like particles as well as 22-nm subviral particles with a spherical or filamentous shape. This Q7 HBV-21 cell line has been maintained in the absence of neomycin for 1 year without losing the properties of HBV DNA replication and Dane-like particle production. Our results strongly suggest that the species barrier of HBV infection is at an early step of viral absorption onto or penetration into the target hepatocytes. This nonhuman system for HBV production in culture could be used to complement the human HepG2 system.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of neutrophils or mononuclear cells with washed platelets (all prepared from human venous blood) resulted in an inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation that was dependent on the number of nucleated cells added. The inhibition was potentiated by superoxide dismutase and reversed by oxyhemoglobin. In the case of neutrophils the inhibition was associated with an increase in cGMP, whereas with mononuclear cells both cAMP and cGMP were increased. The inhibitory activity of neutrophils or mononuclear cells was prevented by their preincubation with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine methyl ester. L-Arginine reversed the action of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine methyl ester, whereas D-arginine was ineffective. Preincubation of the cells with catalase or mannitol did not prevent their inhibitory action on platelet aggregation. The inhibition of platelet aggregation was not due to platelet damage or to uptake of thrombin by neutrophils or mononuclear cells. It was overcome by increasing the concentration of thrombin and was absent in cell-free supernatants obtained from a suspension of neutrophils or mononuclear cells or from mixtures of platelets with neutrophils or platelets with mononuclear cells. These data provide evidence for the release of a nitric oxide-like factor from human neutrophils and mononuclear cells. In addition, evidence is provided that, as in stimulated murine macrophages and endothelial cells, the precursor of this factor is L-arginine.\r"

Immunized monkeys developed anti-SIV antibodies detectable by whole-virus ELISA and by immunoblot reactivity; these antibodies had weak neutralizing activity. One week after the last immunization, monkeys were challenged with 200-1000 animal infectious doses of uncloned, live SIV. The same strain of SIV that was used for vaccination was also used for challenge. Anamnestic antibody responses and SIV recovery from peripheral blood were used to evaluate infection following the live virus challenge; two of six vaccinated monkeys showed no evidence of infection following the live virus challenge. Transfusion of 10 ml of whole blood from these two into uninfected, naive rhesus monkeys did not result infection of the recipients, providing further support for the lack of infection in the two previously vaccinated animals. Four of four unvaccinated control monkeys inoculated with these doses of live SIV became infected and three of these died with AIDS 118-258 days after infection. Only one of the six vaccinated monkeys has died to date. In situ hybridization with lymph node biopsy specimens suggested that the virus load was much higher in control macaques than in vaccinated macaques. These results indicate that vaccination with inactivated whole virus can protect macaques against challenge with live SIV. Furthermore, they provide hope that vaccine protection against human AIDS virus infection may be possible.\r"

Clinical trials have shown that HMBA can cause positive therapeutic responses in some cancer patients, but clinical efficacy may be limited, in part, by dose-related toxicity. Potential improvements in efficacy may be accomplished by changes in the chemical structure of inducing agents and by increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to inducers of differentiation. We have previously described an approach to improving tumor cell responsiveness to inducing agents. Transformed cell lines that have acquired low levels of resistance to vincristine display a markedly increased sensitivity to HMBA. We now report on a series of hybrid polar/apolar compounds--some of which are as active as HMBA and several of which are significantly more active than HMBA in vitro--whose chemical structures make it likely that they have different pharmacokinetics. Vincristine-resistant murine erythroleukemia cells also are shown to have marked increased sensitivity to these hybrid polar/apolar compounds. Thus these findings suggest potentially useful strategies for the application of polar/apolar inducers of differentiation to the treatment of cancers. These studies also provide approaches to further understanding of the biological process of terminal differentiation.\r"

In this paper, we show that it is indeed ascorbate that completely protects plasma lipids against detectable peroxidative damage induced by aqueous peroxyl radicals and that ascorbate is the only plasma antioxidant that can do so. Plasma devoid of ascorbate, but no other endogenous antioxidant, is extremely vulnerable to oxidant stress and susceptible to peroxidative damage to lipids. The plasma proteins' thiols, although they become oxidized immediately upon exposure to aqueous peroxyl radicals, are inefficient radical scavengers and appear to be consumed mainly by autoxidation. Our data demonstrate that ascorbate is the most effective aqueous-phase antioxidant in human blood plasma and suggest that in humans ascorbate is a physiological antioxidant of major importance for protection against diseases and degenerative processes caused by oxidant stress.\r"

Since vasopressin in the lateral septum is known to be involved in the control of body temperature, we investigated whether infusion of vasopressin in the lateral septum during autumn-winter could influence hypothermic patterns normally seen in hibernating animals. Hamsters whose lateral septum was infused with vasopressin showed almost no periods of hypothermia, whereas hamsters treated with control infusions displayed a normal hibernation pattern. The results indicate that persistence of vasopressin release in the lateral septum of the European hamster during winter can prevent hibernation.\r"

We report here the results of binding studies in the cortex and neostriatum of rat and monkey using the D2 selective antagonist [3H]raclopride. In both structures [3H]raclopride bound in a sodium-dependent and saturable manner to a single population of sites with pharmacological profiles of dopamine D2 receptors. D2 sites were present in all regions of the cortex, although their density was much lower than in the neostriatum. The density of these sites in both monkey and, to a lesser extent, rat cortex displayed a rostral-caudal gradient with highest concentrations in the prefrontal and lowest concentrations in the occipital cortex, corresponding to dopamine levels in these areas. Thus, the present study establishes the presence and widespread distribution of dopamine D2 receptors in the cortex.\r"

It results in the synthesis of an altered vasopressin precursor of which the axonal transport is blocked. Paradoxically, a small number of solitary hypothalamic neurons displays all the immunoreactivities of the wild-type vasopressin precursor (i.e., vasopressin, neurophysin, and a glycopeptide). In the present paper we provide evidence that these neurons have undergone a switch to a genuine heterozygous (di/+) phenotype; i.e., they contain the immunoreactivities of both the wild-type and the mutated vasopressin precursors. In the neural lobe, glycopeptide fibers are also present, showing that axonal transport of the wild-type precursor is restored. Moreover, the number of neurons displaying this di/+ phenotype increases markedly and in a linear way (from 0.1% up to 3% of the vasopressin cells) with age. These findings indicate that after mitotic division has ceased, genomic alterations occur in somatic neurons in vivo. The molecular event generating the di/+ phenotype in the di/di animal could involve a somatic intrachromosomal gene conversion between the homologous exons of the vasopressin and the related oxytocin genes.\r"

  ".U": "89345676\r", 
  ".W": "Sympathetic neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) for their survival both in vivo and in vitro; these cells die upon acute deprivation of NGF. We studied the effects of agents that cause membrane depolarization on neuronal survival after NGF deprivation. High-K+ medium (greater than or equal to 33 mM) prevented cell death; the effect of K+ was dose-dependent (EC50 = 21 mM). The protection by high K+ was abolished either by withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+ or by preloading the cells with a Ca2+ chelator. The involvement of Ca2+ flux across membranes in high-K+ saving of NGF-deprived neurons was also supported by experiments using Ca2+-channel antagonists and agonists. The Ca2+ antagonists nimodipine and nifedipine effectively blocked the survival-promoting effect of high K+. The Ca2+ agonists Bay K 8644 and (S)-202-791 did not by themselves save neurons from NGF deprivation but did strongly augment the effect of high K+; EC50 was shifted from 21 mM to 13 mM. These data suggest that dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels play a major role in the high-K+ saving. The depolarizing agents choline (EC50 = 1 mM) and carbamoylcholine (EC50 = 1 microM), acting through nicotinic cholinergic receptors, also rescued NGF-deprived neurons. The saving effect of nicotinic agonists was not blocked by withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+ but was counteracted by a chelator of intracellular Ca2+, suggesting the possible involvement of Ca2+ release from internal stores. Based on these findings we propose a \"Ca2+ set-point hypothesis\" for the degree of trophic-factor dependence of sympathetic neurons in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "13C NMR spectroscopy may offer a unique ability to characterize the metabolic response to graded reduction in coronary flow since it allows repeated, nondestructive identification of products of intermediary metabolism in the same heart. The sensitivity of 13C parameters of glucose metabolism was compared with changes in levels of phosphocreatine, ATP, and pH as determined by 31P NMR in the intact, beating rat heart model during graded reductions in coronary flow. Experiments were performed during 60 min of perfusion with [1-13C]glucose (5 mM) at normal flow (15 ml/min) and at the reduced flow rates of 5 and 2 ml/min. During flow at 5 ml/min, isovolumic developed pressure fell to 51 +/- 4% of control. Although phosphocreatine, ATP, and pH were not changed, [3-13C]lactate was increased (1.46 +/- 0.12 mumol/g of wet weight vs. 0.63 +/- 0.08 during normal flow). In addition, the time to 50% maximum enrichment of [2-13C]glutamate was prolonged (17 +/- 1 min vs. 9 +/- 1 min during normal flow), indicating that glucose-supported flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was decreased. The relative anaplerotic contribution to citrate synthase-supported TCA flux was increased from 6% to 35%. These 13C metabolic changes could not be reproduced by reduced [1-13C]glucose delivery in the absence of ischemia, although similar reduced TCA flux indices were reproduced in additional hearts when workload was reduced by low calcium (0.7 mM) perfusion. Therefore, the information provided by 13C NMR spectroscopy can be a more sensitive indicator of flow-induced alterations in cardiac metabolism than that provided by the much more commonly used 31P NMR technique.\r"

Forty-one patients had preoperative radiotherapy, and 8 had failed previous attempts at reconstruction. Forty-nine of the 60 reconstructions were carried out primarily, most commonly following ablative surgery for radiorecurrent squamous carcinoma. Ages ranged from 19 to 85 years, and follow-up ranged from 2 months to 5 years. Flap survival was 95 percent. Eight-six percent of patients returned to their previous activities. There were 2 perioperative deaths, and 31 patients were alive at follow-up. Horizontal defects from 5 to 16 cm were reconstructed, and in 22 patients, both oral lining and skin coverage were replaced. Radiographic evidence of bone union was noted in 96 percent of synostoses, and clinical union was seen in all but one patient. One patient required bilateral hemimandibular reconstructions for sequential primaries at different operative sittings. Functional and cosmetic results were generally satisfactory and were excellent in bone-only reconstructions. Several surgical principles evolved to minimize bulk and eliminate the need for intermaxillary fixation or external fixation postoperatively. To improve results in large or more lateral through-and-through defects, an accessory pectoralis musculocutaneous flap proved advantageous. Cosmetic and functional results depend largely on three factors: the extent of the surgery, the leanness of the patient, and his or her position on the surgical learning curve.\r"

Secondary correction of the nasal deformity was not performed in either group. Our findings indicated that in both groups, vertical asymmetries of the nasal skin envelope were similar. The alar dome on the cleft side was depressed, the columella was shorter on the cleft side, and there was hooding at the nostril apex. The principal difference between the two lip repairs was observed in the horizontal dimension of the nasal skin envelope. The position of the alar base was more normal following the Millard I repair, while the triangular flap repair left the alar base laterally displaced. When considered together with flattening of the cleft alar dome, a horizontal skin-envelope deficiency from middome to lateral alar crease was produced in the Millard I group. More lateral positioning of the alar base after the triangular flap technique minimized this horizontal skin deficiency. The triangular flap technique produced a secondary nasal deformity that looked worse but was easier to correct. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

We report seven cases of double lip, all in males, of which six were in the upper lip and one in the lower lip. It was quite interesting to observe that in the upper lip, the buccal portion of the double lip appeared on either side with a midline constriction; in the lower lip, it was prominent in the midline without any central constriction. Surgical excision under regional nerve block anesthesia gives good results. The embryology, clinical appearances, and histopathology are discussed with a review of the literature.\r"

Our purpose was to compare the structural and functional properties of free muscle grafts and continuously perfused muscle flaps transplanted into the faces of monkeys. In adult monkeys, the facial muscles were replaced by either a free graft of a donor muscle from the lower limb or a denervated flap of ipsilateral temporalis muscle. Each graft or flap was reinnervated with the preserved buccal branch of the facial nerve. The control muscles, grafts, and flaps were examined 90 days later for gross appearance, contractile properties, and fiber areas. Compared with muscle flaps, free grafts showed greater adaptability to the new location and innervation and a closer approximation to the structural and functional properties of the original facial musculature.\r"

Debridement and muscle or omental flap closure were performed in all instances of mediastinitis, with an overall mortality rate of 5.3 percent. The results of this treatment are reviewed, and the evolution of current therapeutic guidelines is described. When compared with closed-catheter irrigation and open granulation techniques, flap closure is shown to result in a fourfold decrease in mortality, an increased success of primary therapy, and a diminished length of hospitalization following treatment. This evidence supports the conclusion that debridement and flap closure should be considered the primary therapy for patients with poststernotomy mediastinitis.\r"

Firm capsule formation was considered a complication only if another intervention (reoperation, closed capsulotomy, etc.) was recommended by the surgeon or requested by the patient. Ninety-six percent of the patients with polyurethane prostheses had a satisfactory (grade II) or better than satisfactory (grade IA or IB) result, whereas 72 percent of the patients with a standard silicone-gel prosthesis achieved a satisfactory (grade II) or better than satisfactory (grade IA or IB) result. Technical details for use of polyurethane prostheses are given, as well as complications inherent to the polyurethane-covered implant.\r"

It has three functions: (1) it provides supplementary blood flow to ischemic zones, (2) it assists venous drainage in regions of venous insufficiency, and (3) it induces the formation of a capillary network. Its skin covering role is only accessory. We have applied this principle to osteitis, pseudoarthrosis, and arteriosclerosis. The nutrient flap constitutes a new type of treatment for stage IV arteriosclerosis of the lower limbs when classical revascularization techniques cannot be performed and when high amputation is indicated. Four clinical cases and the surgical techniques used are described. The flap, usually raised from the latissimus dorsi, is anastomosed to the popliteal artery by means of an inverted saphenous vein graft. It is applied to the distal extremity of the limb after excision of the necrotic tissues. The nutrient flap preserves weight-bearing by maintaining the heel.\r"

And if so, when does one start such a therapy? Fluosol-DA 20% (Fluosol) has increased random skin-flap survival when given preoperatively in our laboratory. An experiment was devised to see if it could rescue failing flaps. One-hundred Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control (N = 25) and five experimental groups (N = 15). All had 10 X 13 cm reverse McFarlane random flaps raised and reinset. The experimental groups underwent hemodilution with either Ringer's lactate or Fluosol at 4, 8, and 12 hours after flap elevation. All were kept in 50% oxygen for 72 hours postoperatively. The flaps and their corresponding necrotic areas were measured on day 7. As to when to institute a therapy, we simultaneously evaluated the use of a microfluorometer as a monitor of flap survival. Analysis of flap survival showed little difference between control and experimental Ringer's lactate or Fluosol groups. Analysis of the microfluorometric data led to the following points. First, as a monitor of flap viability, it is limited by a lack of specificity and sensitivity. Second, comparison of the data from portions of the flap destined to live with those destined to die suggests that it may not be failure of circulatory inflow that leads to flap death.\r"

This represents the first case in the literature to comment on (1) the absence of bilaterality of the anatomic finding and (2) carpal tunnel syndrome relative to median artery aneurysm. With this in mind, a plea is made for careful exploration of the carpal tunnel, maintaining an incision as far to the ulnar side of the median nerve as technically possible with thorough visualization of the contents of the tunnel and any anatomic variance involved. The incidence of the combination of aberrant median artery with high bifurcation of the median nerve is unknown, as is the incidence of aneurysm of the median artery.\r"

The guarded burr is introduced in position through the routine elevation of the bridge soft tissue subperiosteally. The safety latch is used for orientation. With gentle movement along the line connecting the canthi, the desired amount of bone can be removed from the nasofrontal junction with little time consumed. It is important to avoid continuous friction, since this might result in significant heat production and thereby thermal injury to the soft tissue and fluid collection.\r"

The donor sites of the two flaps are closed like Burrough's triangles, bringing the flaps into opposition so that they support each other's projection. The tabs cover all the exposed fat on the nipple so that no skin graft is required on the nipple proper. The result is a nicely shaped nipple that can be designed directly over a scar, maintains a projection averaging 3.8 mm at 10 months, and is technically easy to construct.\r"

The surgical approach to the motor branch has been detailed and specifically emphasizes complete motor branch exposure from the main ulnar nerve trunk to the most distal motor branch entry into the adductor pollicis muscle. This approach permits definition of the exact level of the nerve injury, preservation of any intact proximal fine motor branches, and facilitates the mechanics of nerve repair.\r"

The National Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), focusing on diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, and tuberculosis, was initiated on a nationwide basis in 1977. Data indicate that the program has reduced morbidity and mortality from most vaccine-preventable diseases in Thailand. The goal of the EPI is to have every eligible child fully immunized with efficacious vaccines by 1990. Strategies have been developed and are being used by the \"accelerated EPI\" to achieve this goal.\r"

Extensive efforts have been made in the 1980s to ensure an uninterrupted cold chain through the use of improved equipment and better training of personnel. One important advance is the vaccine cold-chain monitor, which identifies weak spots in the cold chain and prevents the use of heat-damaged vaccine. Further improvements will require efforts by the recipient countries (e.g., better use of the private sector for transport and equipment management), by donor agencies (e.g., greater consideration of the operational and maintenance costs of the equipment selected and resolution of fuel shortages), and by industry (e.g., more appropriate packaging and pricing of vaccine, extension of the expiration period, and increased heat stability.\r"

Vaccination was performed by experienced vaccinators and by individuals without prior vaccination experience who received 2.5-3 hours of training. The overall seroconversion rate following administration was 96%, regardless of the type of syringe used or of the experience of the vaccinator. No significant adverse events were observed in children vaccinated with the new syringes. Although incomplete emptying was noted in 87% of the Ezeject syringes used, this had no effect on the serologic response to measles vaccine. Aspiration for detection of blood before injection of the vaccine was performed significantly (P less than .001) less frequently with Ezeject than with 3-cc syringes by both experienced and inexperienced personnel. Inexperienced vaccinators administered measles vaccine significantly faster (P less than .001) with Ezeject than with 3-cc syringes, but the times were similar for experienced vaccinators. Ezeject is an acceptable alternative to standard syringes for the administration of measles vaccine. Several design modifications that would improve the handling of the device and eliminate the possibility of its reuse have been suggested.\r"

Infection with HIV, which is capable of infecting cells of the immune system and which can remain latent for many years, results in profound and progressive immunosuppression. As a consequence, vaccines may not elicit a protective response from HIV-infected individuals. Stimulation of the immune system may also be a cofactor for the progression of infection to AIDS, since stimulated lymphocytes are needed for the replication of HIV. HIV-positive individuals may also react differently to vaccines than do uninfected persons. The standard vaccines in use today are extremely safe. The possibility that the excellent safety profile of vaccines may be altered in HIV-positive patients must be considered. Since this virus can be transmitted through exposure to blood and blood products, mass immunization programs must take steps to minimize the possibility of accidental transmission of infection during a mass vaccination program. Finally, the problems and prospect for the testing and use of vaccines to prevent HIV are discussed.\r"

Acceleration of existing efforts, with the use of approaches that must differ according to the requirements of individual countries, constitutes the overriding priority for the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). In evaluating immunization programs, priority should be placed on monitoring immunization coverage and disease incidence. Routine reports are essential for this purpose, although they may usefully be supplemented by surveys. The problems revealed by an evaluation of immunization programs can be taken as being generic to the health services as a whole, until proven otherwise. Therefore, in remedying these problems, approaches that improve the health services as a whole should be sought.\r"

In these countries effective use has been made of the personal involvement of top political leaders, beginning with presidents and prime ministers. The media has been used to deliver a single message: get your child vaccinated. This message has been reinforced through coalitions involving religious leaders, primary teachers, village heads, policemen, soldiers, and truck drivers. Support has been gathered from nongovernmental organizations and individuals, ranging from Rotary International to actors, comedians, and sports figures. These political, economic, and administrative resources constitute a low-cost, elastic, permanently renewable resource base that can aid health ministers not only in beginning immunization coverage but also in maintaining it.\r"

A mathematical model of several biological mechanisms that can account for this development is presented. Analysis of this model reveals the conditions under which ocular dominance segregation will occur and determines the resulting patch width. Simulations of the model also exhibit other phenomena associated with early visual development, such as topographic refinement of cortical receptive fields, the confinement of input cell connections to patches, monocular deprivation plasticity including a critical period, and the effect of artificially induced strabismus. The model can be used to predict the results of proposed experiments and to discriminate among various mechanisms of plasticity.\r"

In cell binding assays, mouse N-cadherin did not cross-react with other mouse cadherins, but it did cross-react with chicken N-cadherin. The results indicate that each cadherin type confers distinct adhesive specificities on different cells, and also that the specificity of N-cadherin is conserved between mammalian and avian cells.\r"

A patient with schizoaffective disorder reported benefits from regularly applied electric shocks modeled on previously administered ECT and delivered by a modified electric livestock fence. Such a practice exposes the patient to the risk of a variety of injuries.\r"

The patient had been receiving oral antibiotics and had had recurrent bouts of bacterial peritonitis. Infection was cured with removal of the peritoneal catheter and intraperitoneal and intravenous amphotericin B. The course of this episode of Trichosporon beigelii peritonitis was similar to that of peritonitis caused by other yeasts.\r"
