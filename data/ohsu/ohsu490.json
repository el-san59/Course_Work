The horizontal VOR was studied in nine subjects on two space shuttle missions. Active unpaced head oscillation at 0.3 Hz was used as the stimulus to examine the gain and phase of the VOR with and without visual input, as well as the visual suppression of the reflex. No statistically significant changes were noted inflight in the gains or phase shifts of the VOR during any test condition, or between space motion sickness susceptible and nonsusceptible populations. Although VOR suppression was unaffected by spaceflight, the space motion sickness-susceptible group tended to exhibit greater error in the suppression than the nonsusceptible group. It is concluded that at this stimulus frequency, VOR gain is unaffected by spaceflight, and any minor individual changes do not seem to contribute to space motion sickness.\r"

  ".U": "89322868\r", 
  ".W": "Traditionally, the most important parameters for success in free tissue transfer have been expertise in performing small vessel anastomoses, meticulous donor site dissection, and careful recipient vessel preparation. It has been our experience, in free flap transfers for head and neck reconstruction, that a very crucial, often unrecognized, parameter is the geometry of the vascular pedicle. This term encompasses the three-dimensional positioning of the nutrient vascular pedicle as well as vessel tension and redundancy. The ideal axis for the lie of the vascular pedicle in the neck is in the longitudinal direction. This configuration helps to eliminate the kinking of the pedicle that is observed with side-to-side movements of the head. The primary objectives in recipient vessel selection are to use a healthy artery and vein and to perform the anastomoses in a location that provides easy access for the surgeon and assistant. Recipient vessel selection is also a major determining factor in the achievement of the desired pedicle geometry. We believe that the transverse cervical artery and the external jugular vein are the best recipient vessels for free tissue transfer. The reasons for this selection, as well as technical details to improve pedicle geometry, are discussed in depth. Representative cases that demonstrate pitfalls in vascular pedicle geometry are presented.\r"

The dose of betamethasone was 4 mg every 8 h for six doses, unless delivery occurred. The 251 women who were enrolled gave birth to 262 liveborn infants, 130 in the beta-methasone and 132 in the placebo group; the two groups were evenly matched in most respects. The diagnosis of RDS in the newborn was confirmed by two independent assessors. Seven of the 130 infants in the betamethasone group and 16 of the 132 in the placebo group developed RDS. In infants whose mothers had received at least three injections, RDS was also less frequent in the steroid group than in the placebo group (3/104 and 10/104 respectively; P less than 0.05). There was a significant reduction of RDS in those born between 24 h and 6 days after entry into the trial (0/30 and 8/45 respectively; P less than 0.05). The largest difference in frequency of RDS occurred in the subgroup of infants born before 34 weeks gestation, within 8 days of trial entry, and whose mothers had received at least three injections (0/27 steroid group and 7/32 placebo group; P = 0.03), and there were also significantly fewer neonatal deaths (2/27 and 13/32, respectively; P less than 0.01) in this subgroup. Betamethasone did not provoke earlier delivery. Premature rupture of the membranes and maternal hypertension did not seem to contraindicate the use of steroids: there was no increase in maternal or neonatal sepsis nor in stillbirth in hypertensive pregnancies in the steroid group. Neonatal jaundice was significantly less frequent in the steroid (55/129) than in the placebo group (81/127; P less than 0.01) but not in the subgroups born before 34 completed weeks gestation.\r"

Overall, more than 90% thought that treatment made their problem better. There were no clear differences between the groups in outcome either immediately after treatment, or 10 days or 3 months postpartum, other than more pain associated with pulsed electromagnetic energy treatment at 10 days. Bruising looked more extensive after ultrasound therapy but then seemed to resolve more quickly. Neither therapy had an effect on perineal oedema or haemorrhoids. The place of these new therapies in postnatal care should be clarified by further controlled trials before they become part of routine care.\r"

  ".W": "Purified preparations of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), and interleukin 3 (IL-3 or multi-CSF) alone and in combination, have been compared for their stimulatory effects on human granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC). In cultures of unseparated normal human bone marrow, the combinations of G-CSF plus IL-3 and GM-CSF plus IL-3 stimulated additive numbers of GM colonies, while GM-CSF plus G-CSF stimulated greater than additive numbers of GM colonies, compared with the sum of the colony formation obtained with each factor alone. Cultures of unseparated bone marrow, harvested from patients four to six days after administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), resulted in additive GM colony formation with GM-CSF plus G-CSF, GM-CSF plus IL-3, and G-CSF plus IL-3. In order to address the possibility of secondary factor involvement in the synergistic interaction of GM-CSF and G-CSF, CD33+/CD34+ colony forming cells were separated from normal and post FU marrow by two color fluorescence activated cell sorting. In cultures of CD33+/CD34+ cells the combination of GM-CSF plus G-CSF stimulated a synergistic increase in GM colonies while GM-CSF plus IL-3 stimulated additive numbers of colonies. These results suggest that GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-3 stimulate distinct populations of GM-CFC. Furthermore GM-CSF and G-CSF interact synergistically and this action is a direct effect on progenitor cells not stimulated by GM-CSF or G-CSF alone.\r"

  ".W": "Transplantation of a murine mammary carcinoma (CE maca) into mice induces marked granulocytosis and hypercalcemia secondary to excessive bone resorption. Such responses are not induced by another murine mammary carcinoma Bc66. In order to understand the mechanisms of these unique phenomena, we analyzed mRNA of tumor cells for expression of murine granulopoietic growth factors and studied interactions of tumor-derived factors using antiserum to a growth factor in vitro and in vivo. The Northern blot analysis of CE tumor clones revealed the expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), but no other CSF genes, while the Bc66 clone expressed only M-CSF. The G-CSF and M-CSF gene expression in CE tumor clones was accompanied by secretion of these proteins in culture. The granulocyte stimulating activity of CE tumor-derived G-CSF or recombinant human G-CSF was markedly enhanced by purified M-CSF in vitro. Significant but variable neutrophilia was observed in mice inoculated with CE tumor clones. Anti-M-CSF treatment of CE tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced neutrophilia, but did not affect hypercalcemia. These studies document that G-CSF and M-CSF are produced constitutively from the CE maca, and G-CSF is likely responsible for granulocytosis induced by this tumor. G-CSF and M-CSF function synergistically in granulocyte stimulation in vitro and this synergism may also play a role in marked granulocytosis of tumor-bearing animals, providing further evidence of the effect of CSFs in vivo.\r"

The CSF-1 receptor is identical to the product of the c-fms protooncogene. The present studies monitored the effects of TPA and CSF-1 on c-fms gene expression in human monocytes. The results demonstrate that TPA downmodulates the constitutive expression of c-fms mRNA to low but detectable levels. Treatment of human monocytes with TPA was similarly associated with decreases in levels of the 138- and 125-Kd c-fms-encoded proteins. However, the kinetics of c-fms protein downmodulation indicated independent effects of TPA on c-fms expression at the RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, c-fms protein levels subsequently recovered despite persistently low levels of c-fms mRNA. Although previous studies demonstrated that c-fms protein is down-regulated in the presence of CSF-1, the present results indicate that CSF-1 also downregulates levels of c-fms mRNA. Moreover, the results indicate that CSF-1 increases protein kinase C activity in the membrane fraction. Together, these findings suggest that c-fms gene expression is differentially regulated at both the RNA and protein levels after activation of protein kinase C in human monocytes treated with TPA and CSF-1.\r"

Colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK)-derived colonies appeared in vitro after 12-day incubation; burst-forming unit-megakaryocyte (BFU-MK)-derived colonies appeared after 21 days. CFU-MK-derived colonies were primarily unifocal and composed of 11.6 +/- 1.2 cells/colony; BFU-MK-derived colonies were composed of 2.3 +/- 0.4 foci and 108.6 +/- 4.4 cells/colony. CFU-MK and BFU-MK were separable by counterflow centrifugal elutriation. CFU-MK colony formation was diminished by exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); BFU-MK colony formation was unaffected. CFU-MK and BFU-MK were immunologically phenotyped. CFU-MK expressed the human progenitor cell antigen-1 (HPCA-1, CD34, clone My10) and a major histocompatibility class II locus, HLA-DR, and BFU-MK expressed only detectable amounts of CD34. BFU-MK colony formation was entirely dependent on addition of exogenous hematopoietic growth factors. Recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) possessed such colony-stimulating activity, whereas recombinant erythropoietin (Epo), G-CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-4, and purified thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor did not. These studies indicate the existence of a human megakaryocyte progenitor cell, the BFU-MK, which has unique properties allowing it to be distinguished from the CFU-MK.\r"

  ".W": "Using intact human platelets as the immunogen and a functional, collagen-coated bead agglutination assay, we have produced a murine monoclonal antibody (6F1) that blocks the interaction between platelets and collagen in the presence of Mg++. 6F1 affinity-purified the platelet glycoprotein Ia/IIa complex, and approximately 800 molecules of 6F1 bound per platelet at saturation. 6F1 nearly completely inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and inhibited platelet adhesion to collagen by greater than 95% when plasma proteins were absent. Antibody 10E5, which blocks the binding of adhesive glycoproteins to GPIIb/IIIa, produced only minor inhibition (approximately 25%) of adhesion under the same circumstances. In contrast, when tested in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), 6F1 had only a minor effect on collagen-induced platelet aggregation, prolonging the lag phase but not the slope or maximum aggregation. Similarly, when collagen was precoated with plasma, 6F1 caused less inhibition of platelet adhesion (53%) than without the precoating (greater than 95%). Antibody 10E5 inhibited this adhesion by 32%, and the combination of 6F1 and 10E5 was more effective than either alone, inhibiting it by 90%. Time course studies of platelet agglutination of collagen-coated beads using PRP containing physiologic concentrations of divalent cations showed early inhibition by 6F1, indicating that the GPIa/IIa receptor operates in this environment. With more prolonged incubation, however, 6F1 was less effective; this later agglutination could be partially prevented by adding 10E5 or PGE1 to the 6F1. These data support a model wherein collagen can directly interact with GPIa/IIa and can indirectly interact with GPIIb/IIIa via intermediary adhesive proteins. The physiological significance of these interactions, and potential interactions with other receptors, remains to be established.\r"

Competitive solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) binding studies revealed that 5F7 and 3C1 are directed against different epitopes within factor XI. One antibody (5F7) blocked the surface-mediated proteolytic activation of factor XI and its binding to HMW kininogen, but had no effect on factor-XIa-catalyzed factor IX activation. The other antibody (3C1) is a competitive inhibitor of factor-IX activation by factor XIa, but blocked factor-XI binding to HMW kininogen only at 1,000-fold higher concentration than 5F7. Moreover, HMW kininogen had no effect on the kinetics of factor-XIa-catalyzed factor-IX activation. Furthermore, factor XI CNBr peptide fragments that bind to the 5F7 and 3C1 antibodies were isolated. The peptides that bound to the 5F7 antibody blocked the binding of HMW kininogen to factor XI but did not inhibit factor-XIa-catalyzed factor-IX activation. However, the peptides isolated by the 3C1 antibody inhibited factor-XIa-catalyzed factor-IX activation and had no effect on factor-XI binding to HMW kininogen. Our results indicate that distinct functional domains within the heavy chain region of factor XI are important for the binding of factor XI to HMW kininogen and for activation of factor IX by factor XIa.\r"

We concluded that the lymphocytes positive for the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen present in normal peripheral blood (PB) are natural killer (NK) cells since the positive cells had an NK activity toward K562 cells, and most of the sialyl SSEA-1+ cells were simultaneously positive for Leu-11 (CD-16) and Leu-19. Essentially, no T and B cells, defined by Leu-4 (CD3) and Leu-16 (CD20), were positive for the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen in PB samples taken from healthy donors and patients with disorders unrelated to lymphoid malignancies. Among the malignant lymphoid cells, many sialylated SSEA-1+ cells were observed in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia cells and some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts, but not in CLL cells or malignant lymphoma cells. Sialyl SSEA-1 was also positive in some cultured human lymphoid cell lines. We conclude that expression of the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen is strictly limited to a distinct population of NK cells among the mature lymphocytes in normal PB, but the antigen is present in a wide range of immature lymphoblasts of T- and B-cell lineages as well as the NK-cell lineage. The sialyl SSEA-1 antigen disappears from the surface of immature lymphocytes of T- and B-cell lineages during the course of maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of human recombinant GM-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) was evaluated in ten patients with refractory metastatic carcinoma. Initially they received an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of 5 or 25 micrograms/m2 for assessment of acute responses. Six days later, continuous IV infusions of 100 or 500 micrograms/m2 were initiated for a 14-day treatment course. All patients developed profound leukopenia within five to 30 minutes of the bolus injection. This appeared to result from increased expression of an adhesion-promoting glycoprotein (GP) on neutrophils and monocytes as judged by increased reactivity to the Mo1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Leukocyte counts returned to normal levels within two hours as cells were released from marrow stores. With the continuous infusion, leukocyte counts increased by 24 hours; peak values of 22,960 and 75.900/microL were achieved after ten to 14 days of treatment with the two dose levels of GM-CSF. This leukocytosis was due to an increase in virtually all cell types. At the high dose level, there was a striking increase in neutrophils (49,400/microL) and eosinophils (20,905/microL) with a sixfold increase in monocytes and two- to threefold increase in lymphocytes. Leukocyte counts declined promptly after cessation of the infusion but remained above baseline for as long as 2 weeks in some patients. These results suggest that GM-CSF may be useful as an adjuvant therapy by stimulating myelopoiesis in cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Stromal cells are believed to regulate lympho-hematopoiesis through direct cell-cell interactions and the release of growth factors. Many questions remain, however, about their lineage derivation and functional heterogeneity. We previously prepared a panel of stromal cell lines from murine spleen and bone marrow and characterized them based on their ability to support lymphocyte growth in long-term cultures. These cells are now compared with respect to their expression of various immunoglobulin superfamily and cytokine genes by Northern blot analysis. These results indicate that although stromal cells appear to be mesodermal in origin, they are not closely related developmentally to the hematopoietic progenitor cells they support. The potential production of at least six cytokines was demonstrated. All clones constitutively expressed mRNA for macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor beta and neuroleukin. The most potent lymphocyte supporting clones also made interleukin 7 constitutively. Previous findings had suggested that these clones responded to exogenous stimuli and this has now been demonstrated in terms of induced expression of IL-6 and G/M-CSF mRNA. Interleukin 6 mRNA levels were markedly upregulated by exposure of cells to LPS, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-7, and EGF. G/M-CSF mRNA levels were \"superinduced\" by the combination of LPS and cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. These responses are similar to ones documented by investigators working with endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that stromal cells are a multifunctional component of the lymphopoietic microenvironment and may be active participants in a complex, cytokine-mediated regulatory network.\r"

  ".W": "Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a useful marker for normal lymphocyte precursors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our previous studies, however, have shown that for monitoring minimal residual disease in the circulation, assay for TdT alone is not sufficiently specific to distinguish leukemia cells from the background of rare normal blood TdT+ cells. In an attempt to increase specificity for leukemic cells, we have used double and triple immunophenotypic analysis to characterize normal circulating and bone marrow TdT+ cells. Overall, normal TdT+ cells were about 1000-fold more frequent in the marrow than in the blood. More than 75% of TdT+ cells in both the blood and marrow expressed the CD34, CD22, and HLA-DR antigens. However, circulating TdT+ cells infrequently expressed CD19 (4.5%) and CD9 (2.3%), compared with their marrow counterparts (74% and 47%, respectively). The brightly staining CD10+ phenotype, frequently associated with ALL blasts, was significantly less common among normal blood (5.7%) than marrow (31%) TdT+ cells. Although T-lineage markers were rarely expressed on TdT+ cells in either site, CD7+ cells were far more prevalent within the circulating TdT+ subset (4%) than among the marrow population (less than 0.2%). The results suggest a selective release of lineage-uncommitted and/or thymus-destined TdT+ cells from the marrow into the circulation. Moreover, since CD19, CD9, and high-density CD10 are frequently found on ALL blasts, staining for these markers on TdT+ cells in the circulation should improve the specificity of assay for residual common ALL cells. Likewise, assay for CD5+ and possibly CD7+ TdT+ cells in either marrow or blood should provide a very sensitive method of detection of T-ALL blasts.\r"

  ".W": "Autocrine growth mechanisms of leukemic blast progenitors in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were investigated. Colony formation of leukemic blast progenitors was observed in 14 of 14 patients tested when purified blast cell fraction depleted of both T cells and monocytes was plated in methylcellulose without any colony-stimulating factor (CSF). However, there existed a minimal cell density required to initiate blast progenitor growth with marked patient-to-patient variation. To clarify the role of cell density on the spontaneous growth of blast progenitors, we tested whether leukemic cells produced and secreted some stimulatory humoral factor(s). Production of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) by blast cells was observed in 17 of 18 patients tested. Following further depletion of monocytes, the CSA levels decreased markedly in 14 patients, indicating that blast cells with monocytoid differentiation were responsible for CSA production. We also confirmed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production by leukemic blasts using specific immunologic assays. When leukemic cells were divided into nonadherent nonphagocytic cell fraction and adherent cell fraction, only nonadherent nonphagocytic cells showed clonogenecity and adherent blast cells lacked the colony-forming capacity. The results indicate that there are at least two blast cell subpopulations in AML: one is proliferating subpopulation with self-renewal capacity and the other is supporting subpopulation with functions such as CSF production. The quite intimate relationship between these two blast cell subpopulations in AML may play an important role on the growth of leukemic blast progenitors in vitro.\r"

Culture supernatants of plasma cells from MM, but not from MGUS or normal donor, invariably contained high amounts of IL-1-beta and lower amounts of IL-1-alpha. With a single exception, TNF/LT biologic activity was not detected in the same supernatants. IL-6 was present in two of five supernatants tested. Normal B lymphocytes released both IL-1 and TNF/LT activities for four days after activation in vitro; however, production of these cytokines ceased at the final stage of plasma cell. Unexpectedly, the mRNA extracted from MM plasma cell hybridized with TNF- and LT-specific, as well as IL-1-specific probes, although the culture supernatants did not contain detectable TNF/LT biologic activity. When tested in the fetal rat long bone assay, MM plasma cell supernatants displayed a strong osteoclast-activating factor (OAF) activity, which was greatly reduced but not completely abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies. Anti-TNF or anti-LT antibodies were ineffective in the same test. We conclude that the IL-1 released in vivo by malignant plasma cells has a major role in pathogenesis of lytic bone lesions of human MM.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, a human megakaryoblastic cell line, CMK, was established from the peripheral blood of a megakaryoblastic leukemia patient with Down syndrome. Using this cell line, we studied the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic cells in the presence of highly purified human hematopoietic factors and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In a methylcellulose culture system, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) facilitated colony formation by CMK cells in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum stimulating doses of these factors were 10 and 200 U/mL, respectively. These concentrations were comparable to those that stimulate activity in normal hematopoietic cells. In contrast, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), and erythropoietin (EPO) had no effects on the colony formation of CMK cells. In a liquid culture system, 20% of the CMK cells expressed glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antigen without hematopoietic factors, whereas 40% of the cells expressed GPIIb/IIIa with the addition of IL-3 and GM-CSF. EPO also slightly enhanced expression of GPIIb/IIIa. On the other hand, PMA inhibited growth of CMK cells and induced most of them to express the GPIIb/IIIa antigen. Furthermore, PMA induced CMK cells to produce growth activity toward new inocula of CMK cells. This growth factor (GF) contained colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in normal bone marrow (BM) cells. The activity was believed to be attributable mainly to GM-CSF, since 64% of this activity was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF antibodies and a transcript of GM-CSF was detected in mRNA from PMA-treated CMK cells by Northern blot analysis. These observations suggest that GM-CSF, as well as IL-3, should play an important role in megakaryocytopoiesis.\r"

We have analyzed the hematopoietin(s) requirement of human embryonic BFU-E, as compared to that of adult peripheral blood progenitors: This was basically evaluated in fetal calf serum-free (FCS-) methylcellulose culture of partially or highly purified progenitors treated with human recombinant hemopoietins. At a low seeding concentration (2 x 10(3) cells/dish) purified embryonic BFU-E generated erythroid bursts when treated only with Ep: Further addition of IL-3 or GM-CSF had no effect on BFU-E cloning efficiency, although the size of bursts was increased in a dose-dependent manner, particularly with IL-3. At a similar seeding concentration (ie, 10(3) cells/dish), purified adult BFU-E efficiently generated erythroid bursts in the presence of Ep and GM-CSF or IL-3, while only few small erythroid colonies were observed in the presence of Ep alone. In a final series of experiments, unicellular FCS-cultures of purified embryonic BFU-E gave rise to erythroid bursts in the presence of Ep alone. Furthermore, the cloning efficiency induced by Ep was unmodified by further addition of GM-CSF or IL-3. Unicellular FCS- cultures of highly purified adult peripheral blood progenitors generated no erythroid bursts in the presence of Ep alone. The addition of GM-CSF or IL-3 was required to generate BFU-E colonies. These studies indicate that in human embryonic life, BFU-E require only Ep for efficient erythroid burst formation, while IL-3 and GM-CSF essentially enhance the proliferation of early erythropoietic precursors.\r"

To explore the basis for this anabolic, nonhomeostatic erythropoiesis, the proliferative effect of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors on highly enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells from fetal and adult tissues were compared. Fetal hepatic BFU-E, unlike adult bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) BFU-E, were capable of proliferating in response to erythropoietin in the absence of added GM colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (Epo) directly stimulated the expansion of the fetal BFU-E pool in suspension culture. A murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb), Ep 3, was raised against enriched fetal liver progenitor cells, which detected all fetal BFU-E and which reacted with the erythropoietin-responsive, GM-CSF/IL-3-independent fraction of adult BM BFU-E and CFU-E. All adult PB BFU-E were Ep 3- but became Ep 3+ after stimulation with GM-CSF or IL-3. These data indicate that Epo plays a unique role in fetal hepatic erythropoiesis, stimulating proliferation of immature BFU-E in addition to promoting terminal differentiation of later erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, these results demonstrate a MoAb which detects all erythropoietin-responsive progenitor cells and distinguishes the BFU-E compartments in adult BM and PB.\r"

  ".W": "We used an in vitro measure of drug activity to predict the efficacy of ex vivo purging of leukemic cells from autologous bone marrow grafts. We previously found that the myeloid progenitor cell (CFU-GM) content of the marrow grafts after ex vivo purging with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) correlates with time to hematologic recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. We observed that variable red blood cell concentration of the bone marrow incubation mixture results in differential cytotoxic activity of 4-HC. The CFU-GM content of the graft after the ex vivo treatment is a measure of this 4-HC activity. We analyzed the disease-free survival of 45 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation with 4-HC purged grafts. Patients who relapsed after transplantation had 4.2 +/- 1.1% of graft CFU-GM surviving the ex vivo purge, compared with 1.1 +/- 0.4% for patients who achieved a sustained remission (P = .06). Twenty-three patients with a CFU-GM content after 4-HC purging of greater than 1% of the pretreatment value had an actuarial disease-free survival of 12%, compared to 36% for 22 patients with a less than or equal to 1% CFU-GM content after purging (P = .006). Therefore, percent CFU-GM survival as a measure of 4-HC cytotoxicity identified a group of patients with insufficient purging. Although no randomized clinical trials have documented the need for ex vivo purging, our results suggest that effective bone marrow purging is important for the optimal application of autologous transplantation in the treatment of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Three consecutive patients with the severe phenotype of leukocyte adhesion deficiency characterized by a defective expression of LFA-1, Mac-1 (CR3), and p150.95 on leukocytes have received HLA partially incompatible bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The degree of HLA incompatibility between related donors and recipients was 2 HLA antigens in one and one full haplotype in the two others. Graft-v-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted in T-cell depletion of the bone marrow inoculum and a 60-day course of cyclosporin A. A first attempt led to autologous recovery in one patient. The second transplant in this patient and the first transplant in the two others led to stable partial engraftment of lymphocytes and phagocytic cells, as shown by expression of adhesion molecules (LFA-1, Mac-1) on leukocytes and by HLA typing and restriction fragment-length polymorphism studies using minisatellite probes. Although the level of mixed chimerism was lower in one patient (7% to 30% donor cells) and greater than 50% in the two others, recovery of lymphocyte and phagocytic cell functions was sufficient enough to allow the patient to lead a normal life, infection free in the three cases. These patients, now 57, 32, and 19 months post-transplant, are in good condition without any therapy. These results lead us to propose that the LFA-1 molecule plays a role in HLA-incompatible graft rejection, probably by mediating adhesion of cytotoxic T and non-T lymphocytes to their targets.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and interleukin-3 (IL-3) labeled with 125I were used to study the characteristics and distribution of receptors for these factors on in vitro cell lines and on cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Receptors for GM-CSF and G-CSF were restricted to a subset of myelomonocytic cell lines whereas IL-3 receptors were also found on pre-B- or early B-cell lines. Receptors for all three CSFs were broadly distributed on ANL cells, with considerable variability in levels of expression. Measurement of the colony-forming ability of ANL cells in response to the CSFs showed that there was no direct correlation between the ability of the cells to respond to a growth factor and the absolute number of receptors expressed for that growth factor. Binding of radiolabeled IL-3 and GM-CSF to ANL cells produced complex biphasic curves. Further analysis showed that both IL-3 and GM-CSF were able to partially compete for specific binding of the heterologous radiolabeled ligand to cells from several ANL patients, suggesting that heterogeneity may exist in human CSF receptors. These results provide new insights into the complex role that CSFs may play in ANL.\r"

In suspension cultures we demonstrated FPV propagation and replication using DNA molecular hybridization. Viral RNA and DNA were observed by in situ hybridization in about 10% of marrow cells at day 3. Granulocytes and their precursors were virtually absent from infected cultures after six days. Infected cells showed viral capsid protein predominantly in nuclei by immunofluorescence. In clonal assays, FPV most efficiently inhibited hematopoietic colony formation by myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM), but erythroid colony formation (BFU-E and CFU-E-derived) was also depressed in the presence of virus. Inhibition of colony formation could be abrogated by physical inactivation of the virus or preincubation with specific neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant human colony stimulating factors GM-CSF and G-CSF supported feline myelopoiesis in progenitor assays, and FPV completely inhibited factor dependent colony formation.\r"

  ".U": "89323391\r", 
  ".W": "Induction of terminal differentiation of leukemic and preleukemic cells is a therapeutic approach to leukemia and preleukemia. The 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of leukemia cells, but concentrations required to achieve these effects cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. Seven new analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 were discovered to be either equivalent or more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 as assessed by: (a) inhibition of clonal proliferation of HL-60, EM-2, U937, and patients' myeloid leukemic cells: and (b) induction of differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytes. Furthermore, these analogs stimulated clonal growth of normal human myeloid stem cells. The most potent analog, 1,25-dihydroxy-16ene-23yne-vitamin D3, was about fourfold more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3. This analog decreased clonal growth and expression of c-myc oncogene in HL-60 cells by 50% within ten hours of exposure. Effects on calcium metabolism of these novel analogs in vivo was assessed by intestinal calcium absorption (ICA) and bone calcium mobilization (BCM). Each of the analogs mediated markedly less (10 to 200-fold) ICA and BCM as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. To gain insight into the possible mechanism of action of these new analogs, receptor binding studies were done with 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-D3 and showed that it competed only about 60% as effectively as 1,25(OH)2D3 for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors present in HL-60 cells and 98% as effective as 1,25(OH)2D3 for receptors present in chick intestinal cells. In summary, we have discovered seven novel vitamin D analogs that are more potent than the physiologic 1,25(OH)2D3 as measured by a variety of hematopoietic assays. In contrast, these compounds appear to have the potential to be markedly less toxic (induction of hypercalcemia). These novel vitamin D compounds may be superior to 1,25(OH)2D3 in a number of clinical situations including leukemia/preleukemia; they will provide a tool to dissect the mechanism of action of vitamin D seco-steroids in promoting cellular differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-monocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulate proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro, although patterns of response among clinical cases are diverse. Whether regulatory abnormalities related to growth factor responses in human AML may establish the outgrowth of the neoplasm is unclear. We determined receptor numbers and affinity for IL-3 and GM-CSF on human AML cells using human recombinant IL-3 (rIL-3) and GM-CSF (rGM-CSF). In 13 of 15 cases of primary AML high-affinity (kd 26 to 414 pmol/L) receptors for IL-3 were demonstrable on the cells. The average numbers of IL-3 receptors ranged from 21 to 145 receptors per cell. Normal WBCs showed IL-3 receptors on their surface at similar densities. IL-3 receptor positivity often correlated with GM-CSF receptor positivity of AML; GM-CSF receptors were demonstrated on the cells of 11 of 15 cases, although average numbers of GM-CSF receptors were ten times greater. The in vitro response of the cells to exogenous IL-3 or GM-CSF was examined by measuring thymidine uptake. Because IL-3 and GM-CSF were potent inducers of DNA synthesis in vitro, apparently relatively few receptors are required to permit activation of growth. These experiments did not provide evidence for overexpression or increased receptor sensitivity as an explanation for AML growth. In a minority of cases, however, the cells were unable to respond to IL-3 (four of 15 cases) or GM-CSF (four of 15 cases) despite normal receptor availability on the cell surface.\r"

One type of leukemic clone can be induced to differentiate by recombinant macrophage and granulocyte differentiation-inducing protein-type 2 (MGI-2), which we have shown is Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and another type of leukemic clone can be differentiated by recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or IL-3. There was no subpopulation of growth factor-responsive or differentiation-defective cells before induction of differentiation in either type of clone. In both clones, induction of differentiation-induced requirement for a hematopoietic protein for cell viability. Viability of the cells was maintained by IL-6, IL-3, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) but not by GM-CSF in the cells differentiated by IL-6, and by GM-CSF or IL-3 but not by IL-6 or M-CSF in the cells differentiated by GM-CSF or IL-3. The viable cells with a differentiated phenotype continued to multiply. In undifferentiated leukemic cells with no or few surface receptors for some of these proteins, there was an upregulation of the number of receptors during differentiation for the proteins to which the cells responded. But there were also differentiating leukemic cells with an upregulation of GM-CSF receptors although GM-CSF could not maintain the viability of the differentiating cells. The results indicate that induction of hormone responsiveness and upregulation of the hormone receptors can both occur in differentiating leukemic cells, and that the regulation of these two events can be separated.\r"

  ".U": "89323403\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, we further established the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and IL-1 beta as regulators of proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. IL-1 stimulated tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake of AML cells in 13 of 28 cases. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the leukemic clonality of the IL-1-stimulated cells. Most likely, IL-1 exerted these stimulative effects directly on AML blast cells because IL-1 effectively induced 3H-TdR uptake of CD34-positive AML blasts (separated following cell sorting). Furthermore, adherent cell-depleted AML samples of three patients were more effectively stimulated than nondepleted AML fractions. Cluster and colony formation from adherent cell depleted AML samples could also be stimulated with IL-1, ie, in seven of ten cases analyzed. Subsequent experiments indicated that IL-1 stimulation depended on the release of GM-CSF because (1) induction of DNA synthesis of AML cells by IL-1 could be abrogated with antigranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody, (2) conditioned media (CM) prepared from IL-1 stimulated AML blasts (adherent cell depleted) could stimulate the proliferation of purified normal bone marrow progenitors whereas supernatants from nonstimulated AML blasts did not, and (3) GM-CSF was demonstrated in IL-1/AML-CM with a specific radioimmunoassay, while GM-CSF was not detectable in nonstimulated supernatants. In one case of AML showing significant 3H-TdR uptake in the absence of CSFs, this spontaneous DNA synthesis was found to depend on autocrine IL-1 beta release as it could be suppressed with anti-IL-1 beta antibody or anti-GM-CSF. The blockade by anti-IL-1 beta could be overcome by the addition of high concentrations of IL-1 beta as well as GM-CSF. Thus, in this particular case, endogenously produced IL-1 beta had stimulated the release of GM-CSF which resulted in GM-CSF-dependent proliferation. The results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is often regulated by IL-1 rather than being constitutive.\r"

Since we found a similar activity of the human factor on simian bone marrow cells, we investigated the in vivo effects of recombinant human (rh) IL-3 in healthy rhesus monkeys (n = 10). rh IL-3 was administered subcutaneously (SC) to monkeys at different doses (11, 33, and 100 micrograms/kg/d) for 14 days followed by subsequent rh GM-CSF administration (5.5 micrograms/kg/d SC) for another two weeks. During the second week of rh IL-3 administration monkeys responded with a twofold to threefold increase of WBCs caused by a dose-dependent elevation of basophils (up to 40% of WBCs) and eosinophils. rh IL-3 also induced a dose-dependent increase of histamine (up to 700-fold above normal values) in monkey blood cells. Administration of rh GM-CSF to rh IL-3 pretreated monkeys resulted in a twofold enhanced increase in WBCs (due mainly to eosinophils and neutrophils) compared with animals treated with rh GM-CSF alone. Simultaneous administration of both cytokines (100 micrograms/kg rh IL-3 + 5.5 micrograms/kg rh GM-CSF SC) to two separate monkeys for 14 days induced a WBC elevation similar to that observed in monkeys treated with rh GM-CSF alone. In conclusion, our results indicate that rh IL-3 is a differentiation factor for blood basophils and primes the hematopoietic system for subsequent rh GM-CSF actions.\r"

  ".W": "The gamma chain of human fibrinogen is heterogeneous in length at the C-terminus due to differential RNA processing of the gamma chain-gene primary transcript. We have produced two specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against the gamma-chain epitopes generated by this alternative processing event: anti-gamma 57.5(408-416) (L2B), which reacts with gamma 57.5 and gamma 55 chains, and anti-gamma 50(337-411) (H9B7), which reacts preferentially with gamma 50 chains. Using these MoAbs we have studied the expression of gamma-chain polypeptides by immunofluorescence microscopy in the tissues of fibrinogen biosynthesis and have determined that gamma 57.5 polypeptide is expressed in hepatocytes but is absent or present in significantly reduced amounts in megakaryocytes. Therefore the gamma 50 chain is found in plasma, platelet, and megakaryocyte fibrinogens, but the gamma 57.5 chain is found only in plasma fibrinogen. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of gamma 55 includes the L2B epitope 57.5(408-416). Using MoAb L2B we have determined that gamma 55, which is a post-translationally modified gamma 57.5 chain, is found only in plasma fibrinogen and is absent or present in markedly reduced amounts in platelet or megakaryocyte fibrinogen. In addition, the conformation of the L2B epitope is preserved in gamma 55, as determined by Western blot analysis. The hepatocyte-specific expression of the gamma 57.5-chain polypeptide and the post-translational modification to gamma 55 result in a compartmentalization of gamma-chain polypeptide expression. This is suggestive of different mechanisms regulating human fibrinogen gamma-chain gene expression in hepatocytes v megakaryocytes that may operate in a tissue-specific manner at the level of 3' RNA processing events.\r"

  ".U": "89323426\r", 
  ".W": "The homing of lymphocytes is controlled by interactions with high endothelial venules (HEV), specialized vessels that define sites of lymphocyte extravasation into lymph nodes and inflamed tissues. In humans, lymphocyte-HEV binding involves a lymphocyte surface glycoprotein (GP) of 85 to 95 kd (CD44, H-CAM), defined by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Hermes-1. To define the expression of this homing-associated adhesion molecule during human lymphocyte development, we performed two-color immunofluorescence analyses of human bone marrow (BM), thymus, peripheral blood (PB), and tonsillar lymphocytes. The highest levels of Hermes-1 antigen are displayed by circulating B and T cells in the blood, which are uniformly positive and bear roughly twice the level of antigen present on mature lymphocytes within organized lymphoid tissues and BM. \"Immature\" (CD4+, CD8+) T cells in the thymus are Hermes-1lo to-, whereas thymocytes of mature phenotype (CD4+ or CD8+) are positive. The Hermes-1 antigen is present at high levels on the same population of thymocytes that bears high surface levels of CD3, a component of the T-cell antigen receptor complex, suggesting that levels of T-cell homing and antigen receptors characteristic of mature peripheral T cells appear coordinately during thymocyte maturation/selection. Essentially all T cells in the periphery are Hermes-1hi, including T blasts, and the homing-associated antigen is maintained at high levels on T cells stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and on interleukin-2 (IL-2) maintained T-cell clones and lines. In contrast, although most resting IgD+ B cells are positive a significant fraction of B cells in tonsils are Hermes-1lo to-; these cells are predominantly PNAhi, IgD-, and CD20hi, a phenotype characteristic of sessile, activated B cells in germinal centers. In all lymphocyte populations examined, there is a linear correlation in staining for Hermes-1 and for Hermes-3, an antibody that defines a distinct functionally important epitope on this molecule. The results demonstrate a precise regulation of this homing-associated antigen during lymphocyte differentiation.\r"

B cells from BMT recipients were tested for their ability to undergo the sequential steps of activation (RNA synthesis on stimulation with anti-mu or PMA), proliferation (DNA synthesis on stimulation with anti-mu plus B cell growth factor [BCGF], phorbol myristate acetate [PMA], or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I [SAC] strain bacteria) and differentiation (Ig synthesis stimulated by T cell replacing factor [TRF]). B-cell maturation-associated cell surface markers were simultaneously investigated. \"Early\" (less than 10 months) posttransplant patients demonstrated defective B-cell activation and also failed to undergo normal proliferation and differentiation. Despite their functional impairment, the early patients' B cells displayed an \"activated\" phenotype with increased proportions of B cells displaying CD23 (a BCGF receptor) and decreased proportions of Leu 8+ B cells. Furthermore, these patients were uniquely distinguished by the fact that their B cells only weakly (if at all) expressed the CD19 antigen. In contrast, B cells from \"late\" patients (greater than or equal to 10 months post-BMT) activated and proliferated normally and displayed a normal cell surface phenotype, yet were unable to differentiate to high rate Ig secretion with TRF. Our results suggest a phenotype/function dissociation in early posttransplant period. With time, B cells in BMT patients acquire a normal surface phenotype and can activate and proliferate normally, yet still demonstrate a block in terminal differentiation.\r"

Fetal progenitors were more sensitive to these effects of epo than were progenitors from adults, displaying these reductions at greater than or equal to 1 U epo/mL. The mechanism was investigated by growing fetal progenitors stimulated by recombinant GM-CSF, in the absence of epo, and when eight-cell clones first appeared, mapping their location, then adding epo, and assessing its effect on the subsequent differentiation of the clones. In the absence of epo, the clones developed exclusively into GM colonies. However, if developing clones were presented with epo, 85% matured into GM colonies, but 15% became multilineage or normoblast colonies. In addition, developing clones that were presented with epo produced colonies that contained fewer neutrophils. These effects of epo on neutrophil generation were observed with each of three varieties of recombinant epo, and also with purified human epo, but were not observed using epo that had been neutralized with rabbit anti-epo antiserum.\r"

In this study, the physical properties of individual cells from both clinical and cultured samples infected with Plasmodium falciparum were tested using micropipette aspiration techniques. Cells containing ring forms took about 50% longer to enter 3 microns pipettes compared with nonparasitised cells, and there was a similar increase in the critical pressure required to induce cell entry. These abnormalities were similar in clinical and cultured samples. More mature cultured parasites (ie, trophozoites and schizonts containing pigment) caused much greater loss of deformability, with entry time and pressure increased four to sixfold. The decrease in deformability of the ring forms was attributable to a deficit in cell surface area/volume ratio (based on micropipette measurement of the surface area and volume of individual cells) and slight stiffening of the cell membrane (shear elastic modulus increased 13%, as measured by pipette aspiration of small membrane tongues). Measurement of the rate of cell shape recovery indicated that the membrane of parasitised cells was not more viscous. The main factor in the drastic loss of deformability of the trophozoites and schizonts was the presence of the large very resistant parasite itself. Otherwise, the cell surface area/volume deficit was slightly less and membrane rigidification slightly greater compared with ring forms. The above abnormalities should cause the trophozoites and schizonts to have great difficulty in traversing splenic or marrow sinuses and could contribute to microvascular occlusion and sequestration. On the other hand, the ring forms may be expected to circulate relatively unhindered.\r"

  ".W": "Transplant outcome was analyzed in 690 recipients of bone marrow transplants (BMTs) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first (n = 299) or second remission (n = 391). Actuarial 5-year leukemia-free survival was 42% +/- 9% (95% confidence interval) and 26% +/- 6%, respectively; relapse rates were 29% +/- 9% and 52% +/- 8%, respectively. Five-year leukemia-free survival was 56% +/- 18% in children and 39% +/- 10% in adults (P less than .02) transplanted in first remission. In first-remission adults, non-T-cell phenotype, male to female donor-recipient sex-match and graft-v-host disease (GVHD) were associated with decreased leukemia-free survival; inclusion of corticosteroids in the regimen to prevent GVHD was associated with increased leukemia-free survival. Variables associated with decreased leukemia-free survival after second-remission transplants were age greater than or equal to 16 years and relapse occurring while on therapy. Variables associated with increased probability of relapse were similar for first- and second-remission transplants and included GVHD prophylaxis without methotrexate and absence of GVHD. In first-remission transplants, leukocyte count greater than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis was also associated with increased relapse; in second remission, relapse while receiving chemotherapy was also associated with increased posttransplant relapse. These data emphasize the importance of both disease- and transplant-related variables in predicting outcome after BMT. They may be used to explain differences between studies, design future trials, and identify persons most likely to benefit from BMT.\r"

To study long-term consequences of transplanting limited numbers of BM stem cells further, we evaluated the hematopoietic reserve in recipient animals after transplantation of varying quantities of BM. Recipient animals demonstrated a donor BM cell dose-dependent decrease in stem cell content and self-renewal capacity that was not reflected in peripheral blood (PB) counts or BM cellularity. This decrease was observed after initial BM recovery and did not change with time after transplantation, demonstrating a permanent loss in BM self-renewal capacity. In addition, animals alive at 3 months, a time selected to allow BM recovery, also demonstrated a donor BM cell dose-dependent decrease in survival at 1 year. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing stem cell number in BMT.\r"

  ".W": "The role of enzymatic deamination of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine in the in vitro growth of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was investigated by means of human red cells deficient in AMP deaminase to which the adenosine deaminase inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin was added. Malaria parasites grew normally in red cells lacking one or both of these enzyme activities. As a further probe of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) catabolism, both infected and uninfected RBCs were incubated with NaF (with and without 2'-deoxycoformycin) and the purine nucleotide/nucleoside content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Uninfected RBCs lacking either AMP or adenosine deaminase were able to bypass the enzyme block and degrade ATP to hypoxanthine. Uninfected RBCs with both deaminases blocked were unable to produce significant quantities of hypoxanthine. On the other hand, infected RBCs were able to bypass blockade of both deaminases and produce hypoxanthine and adenosine. These findings establish that deamination of adenosine and/or AMP are not essential for plasmodial growth. However, further work will be required to elucidate the pathways that permit the parasites to bypass these catabolic steps.\r"

Results were compared with those of a previously reported study using single-dose TBI administered under otherwise identical conditions. Fractionated TBI was less immunosuppressive than single-dose TBI, as evidenced by a significantly higher rate of graft rejection (P = .001). Specifically, sustained allogeneic engraftment was observed in only two of 18 (11%) dogs that received 600 to 800 cGy fractionated TBI as compared with 11 of 17 (65%) dogs that received comparable doses of single-dose TBI. Only at 450 cGy (none of the ten dogs studied had sustained engraftment) and at 920 cGy (four of five dogs that received fractionated and 20 of 21 dogs that received single-dose TBI engrafted) were we unable to find differences between the two modes of radiation. Most dogs that rejected their graft survived with autologous recovery (13 of 22 that received fractionated and eight of 12 that received single-dose TBI; P = .49), presumably the result of extended support provided by the transient allogeneic grafts. We conclude that at equivalent doses fractionated TBI is significantly less effective than single-dose TBI to condition DLA-identical littermate dogs for marrow transplantation. These findings have implications for the design of conditioning programs in clinical transplantation, especially when T-cell-depleted marrow grafts are used.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of a clonal hematopoiesis-supportive bone-marrow stromal cell line GBlneor to engraft and alter the microenvironment-induced anemia of Sl/Sld mice was studied. Prior to stromal cell transplantation, Sl/Sld mice received 1 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) and 13 Gy to the right hind limb. Two months after intravenous (IV) injection of 5 x 10(5) GBlneor cells, 54.4% +/- 17.0% donor origin (G418r) colony-forming cells were recovered from the right hind limb of Sl/Sld mice. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) established from GBlneor-transplanted mice produced 189.5 CFU-GEMM-forming progenitors/flask over 10 weeks compared with 52.7 +/- 6.2 CFU-GEMM forming progenitors/flask from irradiated nontransplanted Sl/Sld mice. A partial correction of macrocytic anemia was detected 2 months after GBlneor transplantation in splenectomized, irradiated Sl/Sld mice (HgB 7.2 +/- 0.4 g/dL; MCV 68.3 +/- 7.0 fL) compared to splenectomized, irradiated, nontransplanted Sl/Sld mice (HgB 5.5 +/- 1.1 g/dL; MCV 76 +/- 8.5 fL) or control Sl/Sld mice (HgB 5.4 +/- 0.5 g/dL; MCV 82.4 +/- 1.3 fL). Mean RBC volume distribution analysis showed a 2.5-fold increase in percentage of peripheral blood RBCs with MCV less than or equal to 45 fL and confirmed reduction of the MCV in splenectomized-GBlneor-transplanted mice compared to control Sl/Sld mice. A hematopoiesis-suppressive clonal stromal cell line derived from LTBMCs of Sl/Sld mice (Sldneor) engrafted as effectively (43.5% +/- 1.2% G418r CFU-F/limb) as did GBlneor cells (38.3% +/- 0.16% G418r CFU-F/limb) to the irradiated right hind limbs of C57Bl/6 mice. LTBMCs established after 2 or 6 months from Sldneor-transplanted mice showed decreased hematopoiesis (182 +/- 12 [2 months] and 3494.3 +/- 408.1 [6 months] CFU-GEMM forming progenitors/flask over 10 weeks) compared to those established from GBlneor-transplanted mice (5980 +/- 530 [2 months] and 7728 +/- 607, [6 months] CFU-GEMM progenitors forming/flask). Thus, transplantation of clonal bone-marrow stromal cell lines in vivo can stably transfer their physiologic properties to normal or mutant mice.\r"

CD7 expression on the tumor cells showed large variations between the individual patients and was highly related to the specific cytotoxicity of WT1-ricin A. Incubation of bone marrow with up to 10(-8)mol/L WT1-ricin A in the presence of 6 mmol/L NH4Cl did not compromise the growth potential of the hematopoietic progenitors CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E. Hematologic engraftment (greater than 10(9) leukocytes/L) occurred within a normal time period (median, 17 days). Seven patients are alive and in complete remission (CR) at 48+, 44+, 40+, 26+, 11+, 7+, and 6+ months after ABMT. Four patients relapsed within 6 months after ABMT. Two of them had the lowest CD7 expression on their tumor cells, the other two were transplanted in CR2 and CR3. Two patients died from transplantation related infections. The immunologic reconstitution was delayed, although the numbers of T cells reached normal levels within 1 month. The number of CD7+ cells remained low up to 1 year after transplantation. The T4/T8-ratio was decreased for at least 6 months. The T-cell response to mitogens recovered to normal levels after 1 year. This study shows that ABMT with WT1-ricin A purged bone marrow in high-risk T-cell malignancies results in a complete hematopoietic and a delayed immunologic reconstitution. The actuarial relapse free survival is 61% at 3 years.\r"

One patient failed to engraft by day 58. There were five other transplant-related deaths: sepsis (one), intracerebral hemorrhage (one), veno-occlusive disease (one), and interstitial pneumonia (two). Four of seven evaluable patients transplanted in early relapse obtained a CR lasting 112, 143, 189, and greater than 615 days. Eight of 11 evaluable patients transplanted in CR have relapsed at a median of 153 days (range, 104 to 311). The actuarial survival for all patients was 19%. There was a trend toward improved relapse-free survival for patients transplanted in remission as opposed to those transplanted in relapse (P = .11).\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hrGM-CSF) stimulated granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony formation from human marrow mononuclear cells (MMCs) in a dose-dependent manner in methylcellulose culture. When phagocytes were depleted from MMCs, GM colony formation from the phagocyte-depleted (PD) MMCs by hrGM-CSF markedly decreased. Experiments in which PD-MMCs were cultured with hrGM-CSF and adherent cells showed that 94% (on day 7 and day 14) of the colonies from PD-MMCs were dependent on the presence of adherent cells. In contrast, the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to form colonies was not affected by phagocyte depletion. To check for the presence or absence of progenitors that could form GM colonies in direct response to hrGM-CSF, single-cell culture of hematopoietic progenitor cell surface antigen (My-10)-positive PD-MMCs was carried out using a flow cytometer and an Autoclone System. In duplicate experiments, 0.7% and 3.5% (day 7) or 3.6% and 3.9% (day 14) of My-10-positive PD-MMCs formed GM colonies in response to hrGM-CSF and 5.1% and 6.0% (day 7) of My-10-positive PD-MMCs formed GM colonies in response to G-CSF. This was clear evidence for the presence of progenitors directly responding to hrGM-CSF. Also observed was a synergistic effect on GM colony formation in which more My-10-positive PD-MMCs stimulated by hrGM-CSF and G-CSF could form GM colonies than the sum of those stimulated by each separately. This enhancing effect of colony-forming activity of hrGM-CSF by adherent cells and the single cell culture experiment were reproduced in serum-free culture system.\r"

We established five different human EBV-B cell lines spontaneously outgrown from nonmalignant peripheral blood cells and long-term bone marrow cultures. CSA derived from all of these lines induces the growth of murine macrophage colonies, whereas virtually no human bone marrow cell progenitors were stimulated. As observed in the tumor cell line MIA PaCa-2, a 4.3-kilobase (kb) transcript was detected in all cases using a human colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 probe. Expression of this transcript can be further stimulated within three hours upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The highly purified native protein exerting macrophage colony-stimulating activity (M-CSA) exhibits a molecular size of approximately 75 to 97 Kd in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The identity of EBV-B cell derived M-CSA with human urinary CSF-1 was confirmed by a complete neutralization of macrophage CSA by an antihuman urinary CSF-1 antiserum. Normal human B lymphocytes purified from tonsils or from mononuclear blood cells also express CSF-1 upon stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. No CSF-1 expression, however, could be detected in normal resting B lymphocytes or in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line RAJI.\r"

In all, enhanced proteolytic degradation of vWF was expressed as a relative decrease in the intact 225-Kd subunit of vWF and a relative increase in the 176-Kd fragment. However, instead of the loss of larger forms of normal multimers reported by other investigators, the plasma of all but one of our patients (whether they had TTP or HUS) contained a set of larger than normal (supranormal) multimers. Hence, although proteolytic fragmentation of vWF was enhanced during acute TTP/HUS, this phenomenon was not associated with the loss of larger multimers. In the five patients who survived the acute disease and underwent plasma exchange (three with HUS and two with chronic relapsing TTP), subunits and fragments returned to normal values, and supranormal multimers were no longer detected in plasma. In conclusion, even though vWF proteolysis is enhanced in acute TTP/HUS, it does not lead to loss of larger multimers.\r"

The prospective renogram and biopsy reports were reviewed and graded into 4 categories: severe rejection, predominant rejection, predominant acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pure ATN. Two extreme patterns of renogram were identified: a sharp rise with a fast decline in the first min, attributed to ATN, and a slowly rising curve with no early peak occurring in severe rejection although not specific to this condition. There was a continuous intermediate spectrum. There was no inter-observer variation in gradings at the 2 ends of the spectrum. In the middle part the difference between 2 independent observers never exceeded more than 1 grade. There was good correlation between the biopsy and renogram gradings, with a discrepancy of more than 1 grade in only 5 patients; 2 of these, with severe rejection on the renogram, showed predominant ATN on biopsy, but the final clinical diagnosis was severe rejection (false positive biopsies). Two patients with biopsies showing severe rejection had a sharp initial up-slope in the renograms but a slower down-slope (over 4 min compared with 1 min in true ATN). With better definition of the criteria these renograms would not have been graded as ATN. There was 1 patient in whom no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy was found (presumed false positive renogram). When properly defined criteria are used to interpret renograms, this simple test is at least as reliable as renal biopsy in differentiating ATN from rejection in the early post-transplant period, especially in the presence of anuria or severe oligurea.\r"

Citrate is a potent inhibitor of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stone formation whose excretion is diminished in some patients with stone disease owing to idiopathic causes or secondary factors such as bowel disease and use of thiazides. The pH within the proximal tubule cells is an important determinant of citrate excretion. Multivariate analysis has shown that the urine concentrations of calcium and citrate are the most important factors in stone formation. In uncontrolled studies potassium citrate, which increases urinary citrate excretion, appears to be promising as a therapeutic agent for patients with stone disease and hypocitraturia refractory to other treatment. On the other hand, there are potential drawbacks to sodium alkali therapy, such as the precipitation of calcium phosphates.\r"

Whereas the other authors have emphasized the anatomy and diagnosis, this article should serve as a dry but basic instruction on the exercise program that has been used in our clinic. We have had a success rate with this program of approximately 80 per cent. Certainly not all of the 20 per cent that fail require surgery. The classic exercises are quadricep sets, straight leg raises, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip flexors, and hamstring stretches, which have endured the test of time. The prevention of flexion extension activity, such as running the stadium stairs in order to strengthen the quadriceps of the patient with patellofemoral subluxation should be emphasized. Complications of conservative treatment, such as low back pain, iliopsoas tendinitis, and muscle soreness and the treatment of these is described. Finally, the importance of stretching the hamstring muscles is a cornerstone in the treatment of patellofemoral problems. Likewise, a tight IT band can put abnormal stress on the lateral aspect of the patella. In this article I have tried to point out our approach to conservative treatment of patellofemoral subluxation.\r"

  ".W": "The release of acetylcholine from autonomic nerves in those tissues that receive a cholinergic innervation is widely believed to dilate blood vessels. Exogenously administered acetylcholine in vivo does dilate vascular beds and produce hypotension; however, this latter effect is indirect and probably the result of liberation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) from endothelial cells. Some blood vessels contain a substantial population of medial constrictor receptors for acetylcholine, and the implications of this presence for vascular control systems has been largely ignored, although it needs to be considered. A survey of the evolution of vasomotor control systems indicates that acetylcholine serves principally as an excitatory transmitter to blood vessels. Neurally mediated cholinergic constriction and not dilation is found in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, with responses initiated by medial muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine constricts many vascular preparations from these lower animals, but some vessels relax, reflecting the emergence of an EDRF responsive to acetylcholine. An examination of cholinergic responses in mammalian vessels reveals that cholinergic (neurogenic) dilation is limited to a very few vascular beds and to only a few species. Both experimental evidence and evolutionary considerations support the likelihood that cholinergic (neural) constriction operates in some vascular regions in mammals and, in particular, in the coronary circulation of some species, including humans. In fact, constriction, and not dilation, may be the dominant vascular response to activation of the cholinergic axis in most mammals, including humans. The complications and contradictions introduced by the simultaneous presence of both EDRF and a cholinergic constrictor innervation involving medial muscarinic receptors are discussed. A variety of evidence is also presented that implicates cholinergic constriction in at least some instances of coronary artery spasm and sudden death.\r"

Both preparations respond to 10(-9) M levels of the peptide although the aortic response is more sustained than that of the portal vein. Endothelin-evoked contractions, unlike those evoked by scorpion alpha-toxins (which are homologous to endothelin) or by veratridine, are insensitive to tetrodotoxin or to the removal of sodium ions from the tissue-bathing medium. Contractile responses to endothelin may still be observed in high-potassium depolarizing medium and are not dependent on the presence of extracellular chloride; however, the responses are dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and are blocked by nitrendipine, nifedipine, or nickel. Endothelin-evoked uptake of 45Ca into aortic tissue is also independent of extracellular sodium or potassium and is blocked by nifedipine. These data strongly suggest that endothelin acts at a site closely coupled to the calcium channel and that depolarization by sodium influx through voltage-dependent channels is not involved in endothelin-induced vasoconstriction.\r"

With video microscopy, blood flow was calculated from measurements of submucosal arteriolar diameter and red blood cell velocity. For the first 30 minutes of reperfusion, the serosa was superfused with a Ringer's vehicle containing either adenosine (ADO; 10(-4) M), acetylcholine (ACh; 10(-5) M), or prostacyclin (PGI2; 3 x 10(-7) M). Thereafter, the substances were removed from the suffusate, and superfusion continued with vehicle alone for an additional 10-30 minutes. These concentrations were equieffective for causing vasodilation. During the first minute of reperfusion, blood flow increased more than 300% of baseline in all groups. Within the subsequent 30 minutes, blood flow fell to 45 +/- 3% of baseline with vehicle alone, which demonstrates the no-reflow phenomenon. While either ADO, ACh, or PGI2 was in the suffusate, vasodilation was persistent. After washout of these substances, the postocclusion blood flows were significantly higher with each treatment than with vehicle alone, which shows that each substance had a positive action. However, with ADO, blood flow was 121 +/- 7% of baseline after washout, whereas with ACh or PGI2, it was 64 +/- 10% or 69 +/- 5% of baseline after washout. This property of ADO was observed if the mucosa was superfused with a Ringer's solution or with a bile salt solution, which suggests that ADO might have similar properties in situ. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the intestinal villi were short, thick, and edematous with epithelial necrosis and crypt degeneration. ADO attenuated most of these histological changes to a greater extent than either PGI2 or ACh. Furthermore, ADO reduced a biochemical index of neutrophil infiltration; tissue myeloperoxidase concentration was increased to 169 +/- 14% of baseline with vehicle but was increased to 120 +/- 8% with ADO. Overall, these observations suggest that ADO protects the intestine from ischemia-reperfusion injury by causing vasodilation and by inhibiting neutrophil function. The vasodilatory effect probably is a minor component because other vasodilators (ACh and PGI2) had minimal protective effects in these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We infused recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rhTNF alpha), lymphotoxin (rhLT), and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into anesthetized sheep with a lung lymph fistula to compare their effects on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, lung lymph dynamics, and eicosanoid release. rhTNF alpha (25-150 micrograms/kg, n = 6 sheep), but not rhLT (25 micrograms/kg, n = 3), rapidly increased lung lymph and plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-k-PGF1 alpha) and caused profound systemic vasodilation and hypotension. Meclofenamate pretreatment (10 mg/kg) of three other sheep given 25 micrograms/kg rhTNF alpha prevented the increase of lymph and plasma 6-k-PGF1 alpha levels, systemic vasodilation, and the early (less than 2 hrs) but not the late (4-6 hours) hypotension caused by rhTNF alpha. LPS (1 micrograms/kg, n = 11) induced a briefer increase of lymph 6-k-PGF1 alpha levels than did rhTNF alpha while plasma 6-k-PGF1 alpha levels did not increase. LPS induced more gradual hypotension than did rhTNF alpha but did not cause systemic vasodilation. LPS and rhTNF alpha, but not rhLT, increased lymph thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels during the first hour of study, whereas only LPS acutely increased plasma TXB2 levels. LPS caused acute pulmonary vasoconstriction and greater acute pulmonary artery hypertension than did either rhTNF alpha or rhLT. Whereas LPS-treated sheep required less fluid transfusion than rhTNF alpha-treated sheep to maintain mean systemic arterial pressure greater than 50 mm Hg, LPS infusion caused a greater increase of lung lymph protein clearance. rhTNF alpha caused minimal alterations of lung microvascular permeability. We conclude that eicosanoid mediators contribute importantly to differences of systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics caused by these agents in sheep. rhTNF alpha cannot account for all of the LPS-induced hemodynamic, lung lymph, and eicosanoid responses in sheep.\r"

  ".W": "Of 22 randomized trials of rehabilitation with exercise after myocardial infarction (MI), one trial had results that achieved conventional statistical significance. To determine whether or not these studies, in the aggregate, show a significant benefit of rehabilitation after myocardial infarction, we performed an overview of all randomized trials, involving 4,554 patients; we evaluated total and cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and fatal and nonfatal reinfarction. For each endpoint, we calculated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the trials combined. After an average of 3 years of follow-up, the ORs were significantly lower in the rehabilitation than in the comparison group: specifically, total mortality (OR = 0.80 [0.66, 0.96]), cardiovascular mortality (OR = 0.78 [0.63, 0.96]), and fatal reinfarction (OR = 0.75 [0.59, 0.95]). The OR for sudden death was significantly lower in the rehabilitation than in the comparison group at 1 year (OR = 0.63 [0.41, 0.97]). The data were compatible with a benefit at 2 (OR = 0.76 [0.54, 1.06]) and 3 years (OR = 0.92 [0.69, 1.23]), but these findings were not statistically significant. For nonfatal reinfarction, there were no significant differences between the two groups after 1 (OR = 1.09 [0.76, 1.57]), 2 (OR = 1.10 [0.82, 1.47]), or 3 years (OR = 1.09 [0.88, 1.34]) of follow-up. The observed 20% reduction in overall mortality reflects a decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality and fatal reinfarction throughout at least 3 years and a reduction in sudden death during the 1st year after infarction and possibly for 2-3 years. With respect to the independent effects of the physical exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation, the relatively small number of \"exercise only\" trials, combined with the possibility that they may have had a formal or informal nonexercise component precludes the possibility of reaching any definitive conclusion. To do so would require a randomized trial of sufficient size to distinguish between no effect and the most plausible effect based on the results of this overview.\r"

The association of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and anterior uveitis without determined cause was first described in children. Recently, the same clinical association has been reported in adults. We report 3 cases of this association and present a review of the literature. Including our 3 patients, 7 cases of this association have been reported in adults. All patients were females aged 27-74 years. Initial symptoms were either ocular, or pseudoviral (fever, myalgia and fatigue). Histological renal studies revealed acute interstitial nephritis with tubular lesions. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were not contributive. Ocular prognosis was always good. In 5 patients, the evolution of renal function was excellent with complete resolution of acute renal failure within a few weeks. Chronic renal failure developed in two of the four patients who did not receive systemic steroid therapy (with evolution towards terminal renal failure in one patient). Three of the patients received 60 mg per day of prednisone and none of them developed chronic renal failure. Despite the small number of patients reported and the possibility of spontaneous regression, these data suggest a beneficial effect of systemic steroid therapy to prevent or reduce interstitial inflammation and subsequent fibrosis.\r"

Marked elevation of serum creatinine (11.9 +/- 0.76 mg/dl), osteocalcin (216.9 +/- 7 ng/ml), parathyroid hormone (PTH, mid-molecule fragment) (24.5 +/- 3.6 ng/ml), alkaline phosphatase (255.2 +/- 54.7 IU/l) and phosphorus (5.6 +/- 0.3 mg/dl) were noted preoperatively. Serum calcium levels remained normal throughout the study period while phosphate levels normalized within one week after transplantation. PTH levels progressively decreased postoperatively over the study period but were still elevated well above normal. Serum osteocalcin decreased to near normal values at 60-90 days after surgery. Both PTH and alkaline phosphatase correlated significantly with osteocalcin preoperatively and postoperatively. The relatively depressed values of osteocalcin in the face of still elevated PTH levels post-transplantation was attributed to the effect of immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy. The significant correlation between PTH and osteocalcin suggests that osteocalcin may be as or more sensitive a measurement of bone turnover than alkaline phosphatase pre- and post-transplantation.\r"

This study examined the accuracy of lateral roentgenographic techniques in determining actual screw penetration in vertebral levels T12 through S1 of ten unilateral sets of pedicles in five anatomic specimens. A true lateral roentgenogram alone was inaccurate for determining the penetration of the anterior cortex by a pedicle screw. The greatest discrepancy between roentgenographically apparent and actual screw penetration was found at the L4 and L5 levels. Deviation from a true lateral roentgenographic axis resulted in the most pronounced change in roentgenographically apparent screw penetration at L4 and L5. The roentgenographic axes resulting in the closest approximation of actual screw penetrations were 5 degrees and 10 degrees above the true lateral axis for the T12-L3 and the L4-S1 levels, respectively. At 50% apparent penetration, the screw may be safely assumed to not be penetrating the anterior cortex using a true lateral roentgenogram. At 80% apparent penetration, 30% and 10% probabilities of actual screw penetration of the anterior cortex exist at L4 and L5, respectively. At 100% apparent penetration, there is an almost 100% probability that the screw is actually protruding through the anterior cortex.\r"

Acute bleeding diathesis may occur during or shortly after surgery and may be difficult to control. The consumptive coagulopathy is not a self-limiting process. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative monitoring of coagulation studies in patients with prolonged spinal procedures may help to identify those patients at risk for fulminant DIC and allow for prompt therapeutic intervention. In the presence of active hemorrhage or in those patients who cannot tolerate large volume transfusion, cryoprecipitate is the replacement product of choice for fibrinogen replacement.\r"

Increased survival for adults after similar burn injuries has been less dramatic than in children because of the profound influences of advancing age and the coexistent processes of aging upon survival after a major injury. Consecutive admissions of patients with massive burn injuries (greater than or equal to 70% BSA) to the Massachusetts General Hospital Adult Burn Unit from 1974 to 1986 were analyzed statistically using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with survival and to identify patient characteristics associated with increases in expected survival. Survival of adults with massive burn injuries has improved markedly, from 24% of adults admitted to the Adult Burn Center in 1974-75 to 48% of adults admitted in 1984-86. An increased likelihood of survival was shown to be associated with the use of artificial skin. Improved survival rates in these massive burn injuries were attributed to multiple factors including wound management of prompt eschar excision and immediate wound closure.\r"

Infusions of cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine have been shown either to have a beneficial clinical effect, to control gastric acid secretion, to maintain gastric pH greater than 4, or to have pharmacokinetic properties similar to intermittent doses. In addition, some evidence suggests that continuous infusions may permit the use of lower doses, leading to cost savings. However, as yet there have been no trials that directly compare continuous and intermittent regimens and show improved outcomes with a continuous regimen. Since candidates for parenteral administration of H2-receptor antagonists are most common in the ICU, several practical issues must be addressed. Patients who receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be suitable candidates for continuous infusions of H2-blockers since these agents can be given in the same container as TPN solutions. These patients also usually have a parenteral access site and infusion pump dedicated to TPN administration. In other patients, drug incompatibilities, limited iv access lines, or a lack of infusion pumps may require frequent interruptions of the infusion in order to administer additional medications, which may lead to a loss of gastric pH control. In most patients, administration of an H2-blocker regimen which maintains consistent pH control after intermittent administration may be the most practical method by which to administer these agents.\r"

However, it is still questionable whether nonallergic bronchial hyperresponsiveness, the hallmark of asthma, is also associated with this condition. In 12 subjects with acute decompensation of chronic postischemic LV failure, we assessed the PC20 methacholine during an episode of acute LV failure and after five to 15 days of intensive diuretic therapy. Weight, arterial blood gases, plethysmographic lung volumes, and expiratory flows were also measured on both visits. Extravascular lung water was estimated indirectly with a radiologic score. During acute decompensation, six subjects had significant airway obstruction and eight had a PC20 less than or equal to 16 mg/ml (significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness). After diuretic therapy, subjects improved significantly, losing an average of 2.2 kg, but they still had chronic LV failure and evidence of an obstructive breathing defect. Although mean PC20 was unchanged, three subjects had significantly improved PC20 after treatment. We conclude that: (1) left ventricular failure is often associated with mild bronchial hyperresponsiveness, although it is not excluded that smoking and the resulting possibility of bronchial obstruction can also play some role; and (2) acute treatment does not generally alter bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, suggesting that chronic LV failure can cause chronic changes to the airways.\r"

This observation supports the hypothesis that BHR to methacholine after HLT is due to denervation hypersensitivity of muscarinic receptors rather than other causes.\r"

Fifty-nine workers were considered to have occupational asthma. A subset of ten had a history consistent with asthma initiated by exposure to high concentrations of an irritant, had persistent symptoms for an average of five years when seen, demonstrated increased reactivity to methacholine, and gave no prior history of pulmonary complaints. These ten had a lower incidence of atopy (20 percent vs 58 percent) and a more frequent history of smoking (80 percent vs 38 percent) than the other subjects with occupational asthma but did not differ in average latency (5.9 years vs 5.7 years). Our findings suggest that irritant-induced asthma is not uncommon, and those affected may have different baseline characteristics from others with occupational asthma.\r"

Patients receiving transplants for CML developed a highly significant fall in diffusing capacity.

Patients in these groups were of similar age and sex and had the same total ventilation time (TVT). The study design provided equal time for each weaning mode after specific criteria for oxygenation and ventilation were satisfied (PaO2 greater than 55 mm Hg on FIO2 less than 0.5; VE less than 12 L/min and two of the following four parameters: MVV greater than 2 VE, VT greater than 5 ml/kg, FVC greater than 10 ml/kg, NIF less than or equal to -20 cm H2O). Of the original 200 patients 165 were entered into the weaning phase; 35 patients were withdrawn prior to weaning due to the discretion of the attending physician or protocol error. Weaning time was not different between the IMV (5.3 +/- 1.2 h, mean +/- SEM) and T-piece groups (5.9 +/- 1.4 h, p = NS). Of the 165 patients, 155 (93 percent) were weaned successfully by protocol, 79 in the IMV and 76 in the T-piece group. Of 155 patients, 136 (88 percent) were weaned on the first attempt by protocol. Of the 19 who were not weaned, 11 were weaned successfully on the second and five on the third trial; three patients required three-day weans. We conclude that clinically stable patients who require short-term mechanical ventilation and meet standard bedside weaning criteria can be weaned efficiently by protocol using either IMV or T-piece techniques.\r"

This study demonstrates that abnormalities of ras genes are a common finding in colorectal carcinomas.

Pathologic slides and archival paraffin blocks were retrieved for confirmation of the original diagnosis and measurement of p21 content. P21 titers were obtained using the RAP-5 monoclonal antibody in a semiquantitative immunohistochemical assay. Titer was expressed as the highest dilution giving definitive staining using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. The analysis indicated that a higher percentage of Dukes' stage C rectal adenocarcinomas had high (greater than or equal to 1:40,000) p21 titers than Dukes' B adenocarcinomas (68.8 vs. 51.4 percent, respectively, P less than 0.05). In view of recent data suggesting that ras oncogene expression confers invasive and metastatic capabilities to NIH 3T3 cells, the authors believe this study offers evidence that overexpression of ras oncogene with overproduction of p21 protein product may be an important prerequisite for the acquisition of metastatic capabilities in the early stages of colon cancer.\r"

Twenty-four patients underwent a Schilling test and retrograde endoscopy of the bypassed gastric segment to determine the presence of intrinsic factor (IF) in gastric aspirates and in mucosal biopsies at 22 +/- 4 months after surgery. Five patients had a normal cobalamin level (405 +/- 44 pg/ml), and gastric juice intrinsic factor was present in three of them (11 +/- 7 ng/ml). Nineteen patients had a low cobalamin level (113 +/- 8 pg/ml), and gastric juice IF was found in only two subjects of this group (10 ng/ml each). Basal gastric juice IF concentration of healthy control subjects was 24 +/- 5 ng/ml. Schilling test results were normal in all five patients of the first group and in only nine patients of the group with cobalamin deficiency after surgery. To assess whether IF was present within the parietal cells of subjects with absent luminal IF, we studied gastric biopsy material of 14 patients using a well-characterized indirect immunoperoxidase method. IF was identified in fundic mucosal biopsy specimens of all 14 patients with absent gastric juice IF. We conclude that cobalamin deficiency occurs in a significant number of patients after gastric bypass and is associated with absence of gastric juice IF. We propose that this abnormality might be caused by inadequate secretion of IF from the bypassed stomach.\r"

The alteration of lipase, trypsin, and amylase activities and their mRNA in diabetic rats were all normalized by replacement of insulin.

In the isolated acini, aclatonium napadisilate and carbamylcholine stimulated amylase release. While the relative efficacy of aclatonium napadisilate was the same as that of carbamylcholine, aclatonium napadisilate was about 20-fold less potent. In the isolated perfused pancreas, 0.1 microM or higher concentrations of aclatonium napadisilate elicited a significant insulin release in the presence of 8.3 mM glucose, whereas an appreciable increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion was obtained with a 10 times higher concentration (1.0 microM). In contrast, carbamylcholine did not stimulate insulin release at a dose (0.1 microM) that stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion. The insulin-releasing effect of aclatonium napadisilate depended on the glucose concentration. These stimulatory effects of aclatonium napadisilate on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic secretion were inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine but were not affected by the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist proglumide. These results indicate that aclatonium napadisilate stimulates both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic secretion via muscarinic receptors and that its action on B cells is more potent than on the exocrine pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose transport in isolated rat cardiomyocytes is stimulated by insulin, catecholamines, and anoxia approximately 2- to 3-fold over basal rates. The molecular mechanisms controlling these responses are unknown. In our search for possible cellular mediators of glucose transport stimulation, we examined the effects of a number of nucleotides on 3-O-methylglucose transport in heart cells. The nucleotides and/or permeable analogs (monosuccinyl, 8-bromo, and dibutyryl derivatives) included cUMP, cIMP, cCMP, cAMP, and cGMP at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1 mM. Of all the nucleotides tested only cGMP analogs induced a significant stimulation of transport at concentrations as low as 100 nM. This effect was observed in both the 8-bromo- and dibutyryl derivatives and with 1 mM cGMP itself. The effect was concentration dependent for both analogs and produced a maximal response equivalent to that of 100 nM insulin. This insulinomimetic effect of cGMP was examined in more detail in order to evaluate its role as a potential mediator of this response. Agents that are known to stimulate guanylate cyclase in the heart produced a clear stimulation of transport when added to cardiomyocytes. These include insulin, aminophylline, histamine, beta-estradiol, and biotin-nitrophenyl ester. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, blocked the insulin response when added to cells before insulin, but was ineffective when added after insulin. In addition, agents that raise intracellular cGMP levels by inhibiting cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases were also examined for effects on glucose transport. Out of several phosphodiesterase inhibitors tested, only Zaprinast (which selectively increases cGMP in heart) stimulated transport in a concentration-dependent manner to within 80% of the maximal insulin effect. These results are consistent with the notion that cGMP may be involved in glucose transport stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown previously that N-methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate, two neuroexcitatory amino acids acting through distinct receptors, may induce the release of GnRH from hypothalamic explants. However, that effect could have no physiological significance, since very high concentrations (50 mM) of NMDA and kainate were required. Here, using agents blocking the activation of receptors to neuroexcitatory amino acids, we evaluated their possible physiological involvement in the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus of 50-day-old male rats in vitro. In control conditions (10 nM glycine and 1 mM mg2+), the release of GnRH in 7.5-min fractions collected for 2-4 h showed an obvious pulsatile pattern. The mean (+/- 1 SD) interval between pulses, identified by PULSAR program, was 34.3 +/- 11.4 min. The stimulation of GnRH release by NMDA (50 mM) added to the medium for 7.5 min could be blocked reversibly in the presence of MK-801 (100 microM) using medium without glycine or enriched with Mg2+ (2 mM). The endogenous pulses of GnRH secretion were abolished in the presence of MK-801 or using increased Mg2+ concentrations as well as in the absence of glycine. In contrast, pulsatile release of GnRH was not affected in the presence of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (0.1 mM), a selective inhibitor of kainate and quisqualate receptors which suppressed the increase in GnRH release induced by kainate (50 mM) without affecting the response to NMDA. These data indicate that the physiological mechanism of pulsatile GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus may involve endogenous neuroexcitatory factors acting through NMDA-sensitive receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Transferrin, a serum iron-binding protein, delivers iron to the cell after binding to specific receptors on the cell surface and is an important component of culture medium for virtually all cell lines, including the FRTL5 line of rat thyroid follicular cells. Therefore, we undertook studies in FRTL5 cells to examine the regulation of the transferrin receptor, the effects of transferrin on growth and differentiated functions, and the interactions of transferrin with several mitogenic pathways. FRTL5 cells possess one class of saturable transferrin receptors (Ka, 0.7 x 10(9) M-1). Binding of 125I-labeled transferrin was highest in actively growing cells and declined progressively, reaching minimal values when confluence was achieved. Removal of transferrin from culture medium caused a rapid increase in transferrin binding. TSH, acting within 5 min, induced a modest increase in transferrin binding, due to a cycloheximide-resistant increase in binding sites. Binding of transferrin after a 24-h incubation was also increased by other mitogenic agents, (Bu)2cAMP, forskolin (FK), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and the phorbol ester TPA. Transferrin alone stimulated growth only minimally, but enhanced the mitogenic effect of TSH, (Bu)2cAMP, and FK, all of which act through the cAMP pathway. In contrast, transferrin did not alter the cAMP-independent mitogenic effects of insulin and IGF-I. Transferrin did not affect TSH-induced cAMP generation. Desferoxamine, an iron chelator, inhibited the mitogenic effects of all of the agents tested. Desferoxamine had no significant effect on TSH-induced cAMP accumulation. We conclude that FRTL5 cells contain saturable receptors for transferrin whose abundance varies with the rate of cell replication. Transferrin down-regulates its own receptors, while stimulation of growth by various mitogens is accompanied by increased binding of transferrin. Transferrin enhances the mitogenic effect of the cAMP-dependent mitogens, TSH, (Bu)2cAMP, and FK, without modifying basal or stimulated cAMP generation. In contrast, transferrin fails to affect the mitogenic responses to IGF-I and insulin, which are cAMP independent. Iron is required for the mitogenic response to various mitogens, especially those that are cAMP dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The release of alpha MSH from the pars intermedia of amphibians is regulated by multiple factors, including classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. In this study we have examined the possible involvement of acetylcholine (ACh) in the regulation of alpha MSH secretion from the pars intermedia of the frog (Rana ridibunda) using the perifusion technique. When intact neurointermediate lobes (NIL) were exposed to graded doses of ACh (3 X 10(-7) to 3 X 10(-4) M), a dose-dependent stimulation of alpha MSH release was observed. Repeated administration of ACh (10(-4) M) induced reproducible responses of NIL without any desensitization phenomenon. ACh was also capable of stimulating alpha MSH release from dispersed intermediate lobe cells, indicating that the neurotransmitter exerts its effect by acting directly on frog melanotrophs. Using the monoclonal antibody M-35 against calf muscarinic receptors we have visualized, by the immunofluorescence technique, the presence of muscarinic receptor-like immunoreactivity in the frog pars intermedia. The stimulatory action of ACh was mimicked by both nicotine and muscarine (10(-5) M each). Nicotine-induced stimulation of alpha MSH release was partially abolished by alpha-bungarotoxin (10(-6) M) and hexamethonium (10(-4) M). The stimulatory effect of muscarine was suppressed by atropine and the M1-muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine (10(-5) M), but not by the M2-muscarinic antagonist gallamine. We have investigated the effect of ACh during administration of specific nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists. While hexomethonium or atropine could block only part of the stimulatory effect of ACh, concomitant administration of these antagonists totally abolished the response of NIL to ACh. Finally, the stimulatory effect of ACh was not impaired during prolonged administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. These data show that ACh stimulates in vitro alpha MSH secretion by frog NIL. Our results also indicate that amphibian pars intermedia cells possess two types of cholinergic receptors, an M1-muscarinic receptor sensitive to pirenzepine and nicotinic receptors sensitive to hexamethonium and alpha-bungarotoxin.\r"

  ".U": "89325166\r", 
  ".W": "The early stages of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are characterized by a selective inability to secrete insulin in response to glucose, coupled to a better response to nonnutrient secretagogues. The deficient glucose response may be a result of the autoimmune process directed toward the beta-cells. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been suggested to be one possible mediator of immunological damage of the beta-cells. In the present study we characterized the sensitivity of beta-cells to different secretagogues after human recombinant IL-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) exposure. Furthermore, experiments were performed to clarify the biochemical mechanisms behind the defective insulin response observed in these islets. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated and kept in tissue culture (medium RPMI-1640 plus 10% calf serum) for 5 days. The islets were subsequently exposed to 60 pM human recombinant IL-1 beta during 48 h in the same culture conditions as above and examined immediately after IL-1 exposure. The rIL-1 beta-treated islets showed a marked reduction of glucose-stimulated insulin release. Stimulation with arginine plus different glucose concentrations, and leucine plus glutamine partially counteracted the rIL-1 beta-induced reduction of insulin release. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glucokinase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were similar in control and IL-1-exposed islets. Treatment with IL-1 also did not impair the activities of NADH+- and NADPH+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate-aspartate transaminase, glutamate-alanine transaminase, citrate synthase, and NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. The oxidation of D-[6-14C]glucose and L-[U-14C]leucine were decreased by 50% in IL-1-treated islets. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the ratios of [2-14C]pyruvate oxidation/[1-14C]pyruvate decarboxylation and L-[U-14C]leucine oxidation/L-[1-14C]leucine decarboxylation, indicating that IL-1 decreases the proportion of generated acetyl-coenzyme-A residues undergoing oxidation. However, in the presence of IL-1 there was a significant increase in L-[U-14C]glutamate oxidation. These combined observations suggest that exposure to IL-1 induces a preferential decrease in glucose-mediated insulin release and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. This mitochondrial dysfunction seems to reflect an impairment in proximal steps of the Krebs cycle. It is conceivable that the IL-1-induced suppression and shift in islet metabolism can be an explanation for the beta-cell insensitivity to glucose observed in the early phases of human and experimental insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Because of the presence of different cell types within the uterus, we were interested in determining whether estrogen-induced PR were cell type specific in the nonhuman primate uterus (rhesus monkey). Immunofluorescent analyses of E receptor (ER) and PR were performed on fresh frozen cryostat sections (6 microns) of uterine tissue from ovariectomized (3 months) and estradiol (E2)-treated (peak level of E2 during an artificial menstrual cycle) rhesus monkeys. Antibodies to ER and PR were obtained from Abbott Laboratories (H222) and Transbio (MPR1). The avidin-biotin complex technique was used with streptavidin-conjugated Texas red for fluorescent detection. Ovariectomized monkeys showed positive fluorescence for ER in luminal and glandular epithelia, stromal cells, and smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. In contrast, positive fluorescence for PR was observed primarily in glandular epithelia, with little or no fluorescent detection in luminal epithelium, stromal cells, or myometrial smooth muscle cells. After E2 treatment strong positive fluorescence for PR was observed in luminal and glandular epithelia, stromal cells, and myometrial smooth muscle cells. Strong positive fluorescence for ER was also observed in the same cell types. Fluorescent detection of ER and PR was restricted to the nuclei of these cell types. These studies show that ER are present constitutively in all cell types of the E-withdrawn (ovariectomized) nonhuman primate uterus, whereas PR are primarily restricted to glandular epithelia. E2 treatment, which simulated the follicular phase and E2 surge, resulted in the appearance of immunofluorescent PR in luminal epithelia, stromal cells, and myometrial smooth muscle cells. These studies serve to define the cellular pattern of E2-induced PR in the primate uterus.\r"

  ".U": "89325194\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that endogenous opioid peptides (EOP) exert paracrine or autocrine effects in the testes. To assess this hypothesis, we examined whether naloxone, by blocking the effects of EOP, influenced serum testosterone levels, apart from its effects on LHRH/LH, in the intact male rat. We found that naloxone increased serum LH and testosterone levels over essentially the same time course and produced dose-dependent increases in serum testosterone levels even though LH levels were maximally elevated at all doses. These data are not consistent with the view that naloxone exerts its effects on testosterone exclusively by altering LHRH/LH release. Additional, perhaps more definitive, evidence of a direct effect of naloxone on testosterone's biosynthesis was provided by our observations that 1) naloxone generated increases in serum testosterone levels in male rats in which the naloxone-induced surge in LH was blocked by nembutal; and 2) intratesticular injections of naloxone increased serum testosterone levels without increasing LH. Although these data suggest that naloxone influences steroidogenesis independently of its effects on LH, we found that the antagonist failed to increase serum testosterone levels in hypophysectomized animals or when serum LH levels were allowed to reach undetectable levels in nembutal-blocked animals. Consequently, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that naloxone facilitates the effects of LH on testosterone's biosynthesis rather than exerting an independent effect of its own. Whether the effects observed in these studies represent a negative autocrine effect of EOP on Leydig cells or a paracrine effect on Sertoli cells remains to be determined. Nevertheless, our results provide, to our knowledge, the first in vivo evidence that EOP modulate testicular steroidogenesis in the intact animal.\r"

In 1959, Neser questioned the very existence of cervical incompetence as an entity, and concluded that, in the final analysis, the problem is a diagnostic one. Liberal use of cerclage in situations of moderate risk of preterm delivery or as a prophylactic measure for multiple gestation does not appear to improve outcome, as judged by prematurity or survival. Because of advances in neonatal care in the last decade, fetal survival has improved tremendously. It is hoped that, in the future, more objective and accurate criteria for the diagnosis of cervical incompetence will emerge, and that outcome of treatment will be measured not by fetal survival, but by prolongation of pregnancy and by birth weight. At present, making an unequivocal diagnosis of cervical incompetence remains an elusive, challenging, and unsolved problem.\r"

To examine this issue further, eight women underwent both midfollicular (days 3 to 10) and midluteal (days 20 to 25) phase hyperglycemic clamp studies (+125 mg glucose/dl) after an overnight fast. Glucose levels rose from 83 +/- 1 to 207 +/- 2 and 87 +/- 1 to 207 +/- 2 mg/dl, respectively, during the follicular and luteal phases. The basal (6 +/- 1 versus 7 +/- 1 microU/ml) and glucose-stimulated (42 +/- 5 versus 43 +/- 6 microU/ml) insulin responses were similar in the follicular and luteal studies. However, glucose uptake was significantly higher during the follicular versus the luteal phase (10.99 +/- 0.97 versus 6.93 +/- 0.37 mg/kg-min; P less than 0.01), as was the ratio of glucose uptake to insulin concentration (30.0 +/- 5.5 versus 19.7 +/- 3.7, P less than 0.01). The authors conclude that: (1) Glucose metabolism is impaired in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; (2) This defect cannot be explained by differences in the plasma insulin response; and (3) This impairment in the ability to promote glucose uptake under hyperglycemic conditions suggests a defect in the mass action effect of glucose per se.\r"

Peak levels were encountered 1 day after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (375 +/- 97 pg/ml). Rapid circhoral fluctuations were observed in all periods of the cycle, unrelated to the LH pulses. In case of ovarian function inhibition (induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists), total renin levels were lower than in the midfollicular phase (126 +/- 56 pg/ml). Low levels also were encountered in the prepubertal period (153 +/- 89 pg/ml). Very high levels (17,600 +/- 11,400 pg/ml) were found in follicular fluids from stimulated cycles. These results show that circulating total renin levels follow a complex pattern in which LH, but possibly also follicle-stimulating hormone and gonadal steroid hormones (estradiol and progesterone), may play a role.\r"

The fibrinolytic activity of plasminogen activator was significantly higher in fluids from follicles that contained oocytes that were later found to fertilize in vitro (group F) as compared with fluids from follicles that contained oocytes that failed to fertilize (NF). To assess whether this difference in overt plasminogen activator activity reflects differences in conversion of an inactive, latent plasminogen activator to the active enzyme, the ability of exogenous trypsin to enhance plasminogen activation was measured. The plasminogen-dependent hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2444 in presence of trasylol (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) was taken as a measure of plasminogen activator activity in these experiments. No activity was found in untreated FFs, while exposure to trypsin resulted in emergence of marked plasminogen activator activity. In addition, FFs exhibited trasylol-sensitive chromogenic activity indicative of serine-protease activity. Both the plasminogen activator and serine-protease levels after tryptic activation were significantly higher in NF than in F samples. Thus, while F samples have most of their plasminogen activator in an active form, NF samples have most of their plasminogen activator in a latent, trypsin-activatable form. Follicular fluids also contain inhibitory activities toward plasmin and trypsin. The inhibition of these enzymes correlates positively with the latency of plasminogen activator. These results suggest a direct relationship between the ability of oocytes to fertilize and the overt to latent plasminogen activator activity ratios in the FFs.\r"

The enzyme exists as a large family of multiple subspecies with highly related structures (alpha-, beta I-, beta II-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-PKC). With an immunocytochemical procedure with subspecies-specific antibodies, beta II-PKC-like immunoreactivity was identified to localize in the beta-cells of the rat pancreatic islets. Neither beta I- nor gamma-PKC-like immunoreactivity was found in both islets and acini. Biochemical analysis confirmed that the rat whole pancreatic tissues contain a significant amount of alpha-PKC and a minute amount of beta II-PKC but neither beta I- nor gamma-PKC. On the other hand, beta II-PKC-like immunoreactivity was not detected in rat insulinoma cells, in which insulin secretion was induced in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and carbachol but not in response to glucose. These findings suggest that beta II-PKC is the major, if not the sole, subspecies of PKC in beta-cells of rat pancreatic islets and a possible candidate for involvement in glucose-induced insulin secretion.\r"

Sprague-Dawley rats were made diabetic with a single injection of alloxan (100 mg/kg). One week later they were injected daily intraperitoneally with either a highly purified ganglioside mixture (10 mg/kg) or sterile saline for 4 wk. At the end of the treatment, sciatic nerves were crushed and allowed to regenerate for 1 wk without ganglioside treatment. The animals were then killed, and the nerves were frozen and processed for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. The number of regrowing axons was counted with a computerized image-analysis system on cross sections taken at predefined distances along the regenerating stump and stained with monoclonal antibody iC8 specific for the 145,000-Mr subunit of the neurofilaments. In untreated diabetic animals the number of axons able to regenerate and sustain elongation for greater than or equal to 13 mm from the crush point was reduced by 40% with respect to control rats. Ganglioside treatment was effective in compensating almost completely for this dramatic reduction. Electron microscopy confirmed that the immunofluorescence counts corresponded to regenerating axons containing neurofilaments. These results suggest that gangliosides are able to compensate for the derangements of axonal transport of cytoskeletal proteins reported in experimental diabetic neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of various stimuli on immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) release from perfused pancreases isolated from control and streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats. Diabetes was induced by injecting 30 mg/kg STZ into rats fasted for 16-18 h 12-17 days before our experiments. Glucose (11.1 mM) caused a distinct biphasic pattern of IRI release from the control pancreas, whereas the first phase was marginal and the second phase was absent in the diabetic pancreas. Arginine (20 mM)-induced IRI release was similar in both groups, whereas IRG release was greater in the control rats than in the diabetic rats. Thus, this model of STZ-D simulates a certain class of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In these diabetic animals, the cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue ceruletide (620 pM) caused a significantly greater increase in IRI release in the presence of 5.6 mM glucose than in the control rats, but ceruletide caused a similar IRG release in both groups. Because CCK and ceruletide stimulate phosphoinositide turnover in pancreatic islets, we examined the effects of carbachol and phorbol ester TPA on IRI release in the presence of 5.6 mM glucose. Carbachol (10 microM), which is thought to generate similar second messengers as ceruletide, induced greater IRI release in diabetic than in control rats. TPA (100 nM) caused a significantly greater increase in IRI release from the diabetic than the control pancreas. Our results demonstrate that the insulin-releasing mechanism involved in protein kinase C activation is enhanced in this model of NIDDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that 1 h of maternal insulin-induced hypoglycemia is teratogenic to rat embryos during the initial stages of neurulation, when they are dependent on uninterrupted glycolysis (day 9.5-9.7 of development). To determine whether this vulnerability persists in later stages of neural tube and cardiac development, we infused insulin into 16 conscious pregnant rats for 1 h beginning after embryos had developed the capacity for aerobic glucose metabolism (day 10.6 of development). Half of the pregnant animals were allowed to become hypoglycemic (44 +/- 2 mg/dl) during the insulin infusions. The other half received glucose infusions to maintain normoglycemia (130 +/- 3 mg/dl). Normal plasma glucose levels were maintained in all animals after the insulin infusions. Embryos were examined on day 11.5 of development. At that time, 1 of 111 embryos from the normoglycemic group and 1 of 109 embryos from the hypoglycemic group were grossly malformed (P greater than .5). Means of embryo crown-rump length (4.15 +/- 0.03 vs. 4.14 +/- 0.03 mm), somite number (29.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 29.8 +/- 0.2), and total protein content (320 +/- 5 vs. 326 +/- 6 micrograms) were also similar in the two groups (P greater than .5). Thus, we could not detect an embryotoxic effect of 1 h of maternal insulin-induced hypoglycemia beginning at day 10.6 of development. This finding is in contrast to our prior demonstration that a similar period of hypoglycemia occurring earlier in neurulation (day 9.7) caused growth retardation and developmental anomalies in embryos.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The gene encoding the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (designated GLUT4) was mapped to the p11----p13 region of the short arm of human chromosome 17 by analyzing its segregation in a panel of reduced human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. In situ hybridization to prometaphase chromosomes indicated that GLUT4 was in band p13. A common two-allele restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) was identified with Kpn I, and linkage of this RFLP to other polymorphic DNA markers in this region of chromosome 17 provides a set of probes that will be useful for examining the role of this gene in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.\r"

One approach to determining whether these \"candidate\" genes influence susceptibility to diabetes is to compare the frequency of a DNA marker(s) (restriction-fragment-length polymorphism) for each gene is appropriately matched groups of patients and control subjects. The identification of a DNA-marker association would suggest that genetic variation at this gene may increase or reduce the risk of developing diabetes. However, the absence of an association does not necessarily imply that this gene does not contribute to the development of diabetes.

  ".W": "The role of membrane carbohydrate in the function of insulin receptors and glucose transporters was investigated with neuraminidase to release sialic acid from isolated rat adipocytes. Pretreatment of adipocytes with neuraminidase resulted in an increase in basal glucose transport. At the same time, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was reduced by an average of 30%. The enzyme action on glucose transport was not due to a nonspecific membrane perturbation because neuraminidase caused only a nonsignificant decrease in the uptake of the amino acid analog alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid and had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated protein synthesis. Insulin binding was slightly increased in neuraminidase-treated cells, yet the shapes of the dose-response curves for insulin stimulation of glucose transport were similar (EC50 = 0.087 +/- 0.010 and 0.082 +/- 0.008 nM for control and treated cells, respectively). The neuraminidase-induced increase in basal transport was the result of an increase in the affinity of the glucose-transport system (Km = 7.3 +/- 1.4 and 3.6 +/- 0.7 mM before and after treatment, respectively) with no change in Vmax. Conversely, enzyme treatment decreased the Vmax of insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport from 87.8 +/- 13.2 to 41.3 +/- 4.9 pmol.2 x 10(5) cells-1.s-1 while not altering the Km. These changes in glucose-transport activity resulting from enzyme treatment were not due to alterations in glucose-transporter concentration on the plasma membrane as measured by the D-glucose-inhibitable binding of [3H]cytochalasin B. Thus, sialic acid plays multiple roles in the control of glucose-transport activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A second peptide (Tyr-Gly-Arg-Ile-Leu-Thr-Leu-Pro-Arg-Ser-Asn-Pro-Ser) was used as a standard and allowed preparation of monoiodinated derivative of theoretical specific activity for use as the radioactive ligand. The assay is specific, highly reproducible, and sensitive, with a detection limit of 10 fmol of receptor. One mole of purified receptor, measured by Scatchard analysis or amino acid analysis, is read as one mole of receptor in the RIA with peptide being the standard. The assay is effective with receptor from multiple sources and could determine the decrease in number of insulin receptors seen in IM-9 lymphocytes after treatment with insulin (downregulation).\r"

To determine if this was caused by an abnormality in activation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport at the cellular level, we measured the rate at which insulin stimulated glucose transport in human adipocytes from obese volunteers. Basal rates of 3-O-methylglucose transport in the absence of insulin were lower (0.20 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.11 pmol.10(-5) cells.10 s-1, P less than .25) in adipocytes from obese subjects (n = 10) than in lean control subjects (n = 5), but this did not achieve statistical significance. Maximal insulin-stimulated (4300 pM insulin) glucose transport rates were significantly decreased in obesity (2.81 +/- 0.81 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.20 pmol.10(-5) cells.10 s-1, P less than .005). It took longer for adipocytes from obese subjects to achieve half-maximal activation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport than those from lean subjects (15 +/- 2 vs. 9.4 +/- 1.2 min, P less than .05). The slower overall rates of activation of maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport observed in adipocytes from obese subjects mirror the slower rates of stimulation of glucose disposal in vivo, which suggests that the in vivo findings are caused by a cellular abnormality in insulin action at a step beyond the binding of insulin to its receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The highest incidence of contact was observed in the appendix; where the apparent nerve density was also greater than in the large or small bowel. Electron-microscopic studies revealed many mast cells adjacent to nerve fibers and membrane-to-membrane contact between axonlike processes and mast cells. Often, these processes were dilated, as were axons in adjacent nerve fibers. These data provide a microanatomic basis for potential communication between nerves and mast cells in the human gastrointestinal mucosa. This may be of physiologic significance in the normal individual and important in disease processes, such as inflammation and fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Arachidonic acid metabolites are involved in a wide spectrum of hepatobiliary physiologic functions and disease. Prostanoids alter hepatic bile flow. Prostaglandins with a C9 ketooxygen stimulate a bicarbonate-rich choleresis and those with a C9 hydroxyloxygen produce a chloride-rich choleresis. Prostaglandin F2 alpha stimulates the release of the potent choleretic glucagon and the stimulatory effect of prostaglandin F2 alpha on bile flow is inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, suggesting that prostaglandins play a role in the release of choleretic hormones as well as in their action. Prostanoids are involved in gallbladder contraction and water absorption. Prostaglandins produce gallbladder contraction in various species and cause gallbladder relaxation in other species. Prostaglandins also may be mediators of cholecystokinetic hormone action; however, cyclooxygenase inhibitors do not inhibit the effect of cholecystokinetic hormones in all species. Prostanoids alter the normal process of water absorption by gallbladder mucosa and induce net water secretion. The inflamed gallbladder secretes rather than absorbs fluid. The demonstration that prostaglandin E2 inhibits gallbladder fluid absorption has led to subsequent studies that demonstrated that the secretion of fluid into the inflamed gallbladder lumen may be mediated by prostanoids. In cholecystitis, the prostanoids may mediate the distention produced by mucosal fluid secretion and the contraction of the diseased gallbladder. The inflammatory changes produced in various experimental models of cholecystitis can be prevented by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors decrease gallbladder prostaglandin formation and are effective in producing relief of the symptoms of gallbladder disease. In experimental cholesterol gallstone formation, prostaglandins are involved in the production of mucin, which acts as a nidus for stone formation, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors prevent the formation of experimental cholesterol gallstones. Prostaglandins have been shown to be cytoprotective in various types of experimental hepatic injury and leukotrienes have been shown to be injurious to hepatocytes and biliary tract tissues. Specific prostanoids and lipoxygenase inhibitors may be valuable in treating patients with various acute hepatic inflammatory disease processes. Continued evaluation of the role of arachidonic acid metabolites in hepatobiliary physiology and disease may lead to important new therapeutic modalities.\r"

Infections in elderly diabetics can be severe and life-threatening, and only through the prompt recognition and treatment of these disorders can morbidity and mortality be avoided. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, in conjunction with surgical intervention, are often necessary to eradicate these infections. Common sites of involvement include the skin, biliary tract, urinary tract, and the soft tissues and bones of the feet.\r"

The mechanism of this injury appears to be, at least in part, a disruption of normal cytoprotective mechanisms by the inhibition of prostaglandin production. Acute injury results from the local effect of some drugs and may resolve with time. Chronic injury may occur with any NSAID and may often be asymptomatic until a complication occurs. Treatment of either lesion centers around NSAID withdrawal and standard ulcer therapy. Although routine prophylaxis of all patients is not indicated, those patients with a history of NSAID injury or other risk factors may need preventive measures if they are treated with NSAIDs. Oral prostaglandins, such as misoprostol, are effective in the prevention of NSAID-induced injury. The efficacy of sucralfate and H2-blockers in this setting appears promising but requires further study.\r"

First, whether it indeed existed, second, whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sample comprised 87 patients: 45 in the prophylactic treatment and 42 in the control group. After excluding drop outs, 41 patients were treated in each group. Twenty nine per cent of patients in the sclerotherapy group and 34% in the control group had a variceal haemorrhage during the period of observation. There was no significant difference in the distributions of the bleeding free intervals between the sclerotherapy and the control groups. During the follow up period 24% of patients in the sclerotherapy group and 46% in the control group died. The distribution of survival times indicates a tendency towards longer survival of patients with prophylactic sclerotherapy, particularly in those with alcoholic cirrhosis.\r"

Final height was found to be influenced by gonadal function. In 108 patients who had spontaneous puberty (91 boys and 17 girls; group A), the mean final height was 151.8 +/- 6.6 (+/- SD) cm in boys and 141.7 +/- 7.4 cm in girls. In 29 patients with combined GH and gonadotropin deficiency (23 boys and 6 girls; group C), whose pubertal development was induced artificially at age 19.5 +/- 2.1 yr in the boys and 18.6 +/- 1.8 yr in the girls, the mean final height was 163.7 +/- 3.9 cm in boys and 151.0 +/- 5.1 cm in girls. The differences in final height between groups A and C were significant in both boys and girls. The shorter final height in group A was caused by the shorter pubertal duration and smaller pubertal height gain than those in normal children. In 24 patients (17 boys and 7 girls; group B) who developed early signs of puberty, gonadal suppression therapy with cyproterone acetate and/or medroxyprogesterone acetate was given. The mean SD score of the final height in these 24 patients was -2.1 +/- 0.6, significantly higher than that in group A. This beneficial effect of gonadal suppression treatment on final height was caused by increases in the duration of puberty and the pubertal height gain.\r"

BP-28 was produced by fetal liver explants at approximately 200 ng/mg total tissue protein.day between days 3 and 6 in culture and was inhibited 60% after 3-day exposure to cycloheximide (10 micrograms/mL). BP-28 production was stimulated over 3-fold by 20 mmol/L theophylline, over 2-fold by 30 mumol/L forskolin, and 90% by 10 micrograms/mL glucagon. The glucose concentration in the medium inversely regulated BP-28 production, which was 68% higher in 2 mmol/L glucose than in 30 mmol/L glucose (P less than 0.001); in contrast, albumin production was 40% lower in 2 mmol/L glucose than in 30 mmol/L (P less than 0.05). BP-28 levels were inhibited 50% by 300 nmol/L insulin or 3 mumol/L dexamethasone. In acid extracts of cultured tissue, BP-28 levels were less than 10% of the amount secreted in 48 h. These results are consistent with the conclusion that intracellular glucose availability is an important regulator of hepatic BP-28 synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Pediatricians willing to administer GH to non-GH-deficient children with short stature are concerned about the potential adverse effects of this hormone on glucose homeostasis and insulin action. This study was designed to determine the effects of GH therapy on carbohydrate metabolism in 10 prepubertal non-GH-deficient children with short stature. After 12 months of treatment with 0.3 U GH/kg BW.day, which resulted in an increase in height velocity from 4.0 +/- 0.3 (+/- SE) to 11.0 +/- 0.4 cm/yr, glucose tolerance was not impaired in these children. Not only were their fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations unchanged from the pretreatment values, but basal glucose turnover did not vary; it was 0.53 +/- 0.04 before and 0.64 +/- 0.06 mmol/m2.min after GH treatment. Using the euglycemic clamp technique, the dose-response curves describing the effects of insulin on glucose disposal were comparable before and after GH treatment. There was a consistent 1.5- to 2-fold increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations during GH treatment, in both the basal and postprandial states, and after oral glucose or iv glucagon stimulation. We conclude that the GH regimen employed was remarkably effective in increasing growth velocity and devoid of detectable diabetogenic effects during a 1-yr treatment period in these non-GH-deficient children.

The weights of the obese monkeys were more than 2 SD above the mean for their sex, while the nonobese monkeys averaged less than 0.25 SD from the mean. Obese males and females had excess body fat located predominantly in the abdominal region; abdominal circumference was highly correlated with total body fat, as estimated by the isotope dilution method (r = 0.98; P less than 0.001). Obese monkeys of both sexes had fasting hyperinsulinemia, greater insulin response to iv glucose administration, and marginally impaired glucose tolerance. Obese males had delayed maximal insulin response to glucose administration. Fasting serum triglycerides also were elevated in the obese monkeys (0.95 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.05 mmol/L; P less than 0.001). Obese males had lower serum dihydrotestosterone levels than nonobese males (3.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.4 nmol/L; P less than 0.01). Nonobese females had approximately 2-fold higher serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than the other groups. We conclude that obese male and female rhesus monkeys have patterns of fat distribution and glucoregulatory abnormalities similar to those of humans with upper body obesity. The contribution of differences in androgen metabolism to the development of obesity and its complications in rhesus monkeys remain to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a genetic disorder in which a lack of hypothalamic GnRH secretion forms the basis for impaired gonadotropin release. Several lines of evidence, including an animal model of GnRH deficiency, suggest that an abnormality at the level of the GnRH gene might be responsible for the secretory defect in patients with IHH. We examined 13 patients (11 males and 2 females) with IHH documented by standard clinical and biochemical criteria, including apulsatile basal LH secretion which was reversed by administration of pulsatile GnRH. The structure of the GnRH gene in these patients was determined using Southern blot analyses. In every case EcoRI digestion revealed a 10-kilobase fragment including the entire GnRH gene, eliminating deletion of the gene as a cause of IHH. Multiple restriction enzymes (Xba I, BglII, BamHI, PstI, TaqI, RsaI, EcoRV, and BglI) and hybridization probes to exons 2 and 4 of the gene were used to search for polymorphisms or relatively small deletions or rearrangements in the GnRH gene. Polymorphisms were not identified, and deletions or rearrangements involving more than 200 basepairs were excluded. We conclude that a major rearrangement of the GnRH gene is not a common basis for IHH in humans.\r"

First, we studied eight patients [mean age, 29 +/- 11 (+/- SD) yr; body mass index, 23 +/- 2 kg/m2] with acute viral or bacterial infections during the acute stage of their infection and 1-3 months after recovery. The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain normoglycemia during hyperinsulinemia (approximately 500 pmol/L) was used as a measure of insulin action. During infection, the glucose requirements in the patients [21 +/- 2 (+/- SE) mumol/kg.min] were 52% less than those in weight- and age-matched normal subjects (44 +/- 2 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001). Compared to data from a large group of normal subjects, the resistance to insulin during infection corresponded to that predicted for a weight-matched 84-yr-old normal person or an age-matched obese person with a body mass index of 37 kg/m2. One to 3 months after recovery, the patients' glucose requirements were still significantly lower (37 +/- 3 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.02) than those in matched normal subjects. To assess the mechanism of insulin resistance, seven additional patients were studied during the acute stage of infection using a low dose insulin infusion (plasma insulin, 215 pmol/L) combined with a [3-3H]glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry. Again, the glucose requirements were 59% lower in the patients (14 +/- 2 mumol/kg.min) than in matched normal subjects (34 +/- 2 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001). This decrease was due to a defect in glucose utilization (18 +/- 2 vs. 37 +/- 1 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001, patients vs. normal subjects) rather than impaired suppression of glucose production (4 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 1 mumol/kg.min, respectively). Total carbohydrate oxidation rates were similar in both groups (16 +/- 2 vs. 14 +/- 1 mumol/kg.min, respectively), whereas the apparent glucose storage was neglible in the patients (2 +/- 1 mumol/kg.min) compared to that in normal subjects (22 +/- 2 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001). We conclude that acute infections induce severe and long-lasting insulin resistance, which is localized to glucose-utilizing pathways. The rate of carbohydrate oxidation is normal during infections, whereas the rate of nonoxidative glucose disposal, as determined by indirect calorimetry, is nearly zero. The apparent blockade in glucose storage could result from diminished glycogen synthesis, accelerated glycogenolysis, or both.\r"

  ".W": "A subset of patients with the syndrome of acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance type A is characterized by acromegaloid features in addition to hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenemia, and an inherent defect in insulin receptor function. It has been proposed that the acromegaloid features result from the interaction of insulin at concentrations encountered in vivo, with a functionally intact insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor closely related to the insulin receptor. We investigated this possibility by examining binding and hormone-stimulated [14C]glucose uptake, [3H]thymidine uptake, and receptor autophosphorylation by both insulin and IGF-I in cultured fibroblasts from two affected patients. In comparison to normal fibroblasts, [125I]insulin binding, insulin-stimulated [14C]glucose, and [3H]thymidine uptake, and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation were each reduced by approximately 50-60% of the absolute values in controls. In contrast to expectation, each of these apparent defects in insulin binding and action were mirrored by a parallel decrease in IGF-I binding and action. Thus, [125I]IGF binding was approximately 50%, IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake was approximately 40% and 60% of the control value, and IGF-I-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was reduced by 40%. Incubation of fibroblasts with insulin at 25 ng/mL reduced subsequent binding of [125I]IGF-I by approximately 20% and did not enhance maximal stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation. We conclude that in some patients with acanthosis nigricans and acromegaloid features, IGF-I receptors of cultured fibroblasts may share the inherent defects of insulin receptor function. These in vitro data do not explain the acromegaloid features observed in vivo, suggesting that acromegaloid features are mediated by other mechanisms.\r"

The 2 groups were similar in age, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and maximal aerobic capacity. The results demonstrated that the ability of insulin to stimulate disposal of a glucose load was significantly reduced in the subjects with a positive family history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. In addition, these individuals had significantly higher plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Since all environmental factors known to modify insulin action and very low density lipoprotein metabolism were equal in the 2 groups, these data suggest that the metabolic differences noted are likely to be genetic in origin.\r"

  ".W": "Nocturnal release of GH has been shown to be related to the early morning rise in plasma glucose (PG) seen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We have studied the effects of suppression of nocturnal GH release during a single night (acute study) and after nightly suppression for 1 week (chronic study). Changes in plasma glucose and counter-regulatory hormone concentrations were monitored in six IDDM patients during a constant overnight insulin infusion alone, after addition of the anticholinergic agent pirenzepine to cause acute GH suppression, and again on the seventh night of such treatment. In control experiments (infusion of insulin alone; 0.075 mU/kg.min) PG increased from (mean +/- SEM) 5.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L at 2400 h to 11.1 +/- 1.3 mmol/L at 0900 h (P = 0.0024). Addition of pirenzepine (100 mg at 2200 h and again at 2400 h) in the acute study resulted in a PG change from 5.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L at 2400 h to 8.4 +/- 1.4 mmol/L at 0900 h (P = 0.17). After pirenzepine administration at the same dose for 7 nights, PG increased from 4.7 +/- 0.6 mmol/L at 2400 h to 6.8 +/- 1.2 mmol/L at 0900 h (P = 0.11). Increases in PG during the study period were significantly less after chronic treatment than after acute treatment compared with changes on control nights. The nocturnal release of GH, which was demonstrated in all patients during the control nights, was suppressed in all patients during the acute study and in four of six patients during the chronic studies. We conclude that initial reduction of the early morning rise of PG in IDDM is associated with acute suppression of nocturnal GH release, and that the more significant sustained effect of anticholinergic GH suppression on the rise of PG may be associated with additional indirect effects on insulin clearance.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of CRH administration on the response of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) induced by an osmotic stimulus in six normal subjects and five patients with hypocorticotropinism without overt diabetes insipidus (four patients with Sheehan's syndrome and one with idiopathic pituitary dwarfism with ACTH deficiency). Hypertonic saline infusion (855 mmol/L saline solutions at a rate of 205 mumol/kg.min for 10 min) increased plasma AVP 5.7-fold (P less than 0.01) in normal subjects and 2.4-fold (P less than 0.05) in the patients. CRH administration significantly augmented the plasma AVP response to the osmotic stimulus in the normal subjects, but not in the patients with hypocorticotropinism. CRH administration alone did not influence plasma AVP. These findings suggest that a central CRH-related mechanism(s) was at least partly involved in the augmentation of AVP release. Based on the relatively low plasma AVP response to the osmotic stimulus in patients and their lower plasma AVP levels and higher plasma osmolality under basal conditions, we suggest that patients with hypocorticotropinism have partial diabetes insipidus, in which impairment of central CRH action might be, at least in part, involved. The response of plasma AVP to the osmotic stimulus was attenuated significantly when the patients were given cortisol. Since basal PRA, plasma aldosterone, plasma osmolality, hematocrit, body weight, mean blood pressure, and heart rate were similar with and without cortisol administration, this effect of cortisol may have been due to central suppression of the AVP response to the osmotic stimulus.\r"

We evaluated 30 cancer patients who received immunotherapy with IL-2 or IL-2 plus lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Blood samples were taken immediately before and 4 and 8 h after infusion of IL-2 or IL-2 plus LAK cells. IL-2 stimulated increased hormone levels 4 h after infusion compared with those before therapy and with basal levels in normal volunteers at the following magnitudes: beta-endorphin, 10-fold; ACTH, 20-fold; and cortisol, 2-fold. The effect of IL-2 was not altered in patients also receiving LAK cells. An effect of treatment course was noted, with higher stimulated values seen 4 h after IL-2 in the second treatment course compared with those after the first course [change (delta) in beta-endorphin, 101 vs. 11 fmol/mL; delta ACTH, 138 vs. 8 pmol/L; delta cortisol, 414 vs. 218 nmol/L].

The major pathologic change revealed by light microscopic examination is a relatively circumscribed area of thickened collagen bundles in the papillary to mid dermis. Ultrastructurally, no remarkable morphologic change is seen in either the collagen or the elastic fibers, except for a variation in the diameters of collagen fibrils within the lesion compared with perilesional normal skin.

For the first 8 weeks, 38 patients received placebo or acitretin, 10, 25, 50, or 75 mg daily, in a double-blind manner. After the double-blind phase, the patients were allowed to continue for a total of 6 months of acitretin therapy at an average dosage of 50 mg/day. When the patients flared after stopping therapy, an additional 6-month course of acitretin therapy was offered. Acitretin, which was as effective as etretinate, had to be given at a dosage of 50 mg/day or more to obtain a significant benefit. Side effects frequently occurred in patients receiving acitretin, 25 mg/day or more, but were generally mild and did not warrant discontinuation of therapy. They were similar to those of etretinate therapy; cheilitis, peeling of palms and soles, and alopecia occurred most frequently. The most common abnormal laboratory test results were elevations in serum triglycerides and, to a lesser extent, serum cholesterol and liver transaminase levels. Acitretin, in view of its much shorter half-life and similar efficacy and side-effect profile compared with etretinate, may be a preferable therapy for psoriasis, especially in women of childbearing age.\r"

A 16-year-old patient had nontender, fire-red mucosae; keratosis pilaris; diffuse, nonscarring alopecia; cataracts; photophobia; corneal vascularization; and decreased visual acuity. Histologic examination of gingival sections showed a dyshesive epithelium with atrophy, dyskeratosis, lack of keratinization, and unusual cytoplasmic inclusions. Results of electron microscopic studies showed a reduced number of desmosomes, amorphous intercellular material, and cytoplasmic inclusions resembling tonofilaments and gap junction material. The patient described in this report represents an apparently sporadic case of hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia. Other cases described previously in the literature are reviewed. We believe this disorder should be brought to the attention of dermatologists because patients with hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia have numerous skin problems and are susceptible to recurrent infection and potentially fatal bullous lung disease. Also, misinterpreted abnormal results from cervical Pap smears could lead to hysterectomy being performed unnecessarily on these patients.\r"

At the end of 1 year, the percentages of scars with moderate, marked, or complete correction were 65.0%, 63.3%, and 85.8% according to physician, patient, and photogrammetric evaluations, respectively. A cohort of 111 patients from the 1-year study were followed for up to 2 years postimplantation to evaluate safety and efficacy. These patients had similar demographic and scar characteristics as the total patient population in the initial study. The efficacy evaluation at the end of 24 months indicated that successful correction was maintained in 64.4%, 58.9%, and 78.9% of scars for physician, patient, and photogrammetric evaluations, respectively. There were no severe hypersensitivity reactions following treatment with Fibrel. The data from these patients demonstrate that one or two Fibrel treatments are effective in maintaining the correction of depressed cutaneous scars for up to 2 years with negligible adverse sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism responsible for attenuation of the peak heart rate response to exercise in patients after cardiac transplantation was studied. Because the donor heart is believed to be surgically denervated, the peak heart rate response to exercise is dependent primarily on 1) an increase in the circulating levels of the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine at peak exercise, and 2) the end-organ responsiveness of the sinoatrial (SA) node to beta-adrenergic stimulation. To assess the former mechanism, the levels of plasma nonepinephrine and epinephrine were measured at rest and at peak exercise on a cycle ergometer in 23 transplant recipients an average of 7 +/- 1 months after transplantation and in 23 normal subjects matched for age. To assess the latter mechanism, the heart rate response to a graded infusion of isoproterenol was determined in six normal subjects with and without atropine pretreatment and in eight transplant recipients. In transplant recipients, both the absolute plasma levels of nonepinephrine and epinephrine at peak exercise and the increments from baseline to peak exercise were comparable with or greater than those in normal subjects. In transplant recipients, the isoproterenol dose that increased heart rate by 25 beats/min over baseline was not different from that in atropine-treated normal subjects (normal subjects 9 +/- 2 ng/kg per min; transplant recipients 11 +/- 1 ng/kg per min; p = NS). These data show that after cardiac transplantation, there is a normal or slight elevation of circulating catecholamines at peak exercise, and that the responsiveness of the SA node to beta-adrenergic stimulation is normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The granules were demonstrated to contain a diphosphoinositide kinase that catalyzes the formation of triphosphoinositide from diphosphoinositide. The enzyme requires adenosine triphosphate and Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. The Km for adenosine triphosphate is 3 mumol/L, and maximal response is observed at 20 mmol/L of Mg2+ or 1 mmol/L of Mn2+, respectively. Triphosphoinositide synthesis in the granules is dependent on the time and temperature of the incubations. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, adenosine, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate decrease the enzyme activity. A comparison of the rate of phosphorylation of intact and broken membrane granules suggests that the phosphorylation occurs on the outer (cytoplasmic) surface of the granules.\r"

Although some experiments suggest that acetaminophen (ACETM) is a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase in certain tissues, it has not been studied in human lung tissue, and controversy exists whether or not true cross-reactivity occurs between ASA and ACETM. Three ASA-sensitive subjects with asthma, who gave a history of reactions to ACETM, underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges and reacted to 1000 mg of ACETM with a greater than 20% fall in FEV1. Two patients were desensitized to ASA and then were rechallenged with 1000 mg of ACETM without reaction. Two patients were desensitized to increasing doses of ACETM, achieving refractoriness to 1500 mg, but not 2000 mg. Thus, cross sensitivity between ASA and ACETM was documented when large challenge doses (1000 mg) of ACETM were used. Furthermore, cross desensitization suggests that in ASA-sensitive subjects with asthma, similar mechanisms are likely to be responsible for reactions to ASA, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACETM.\r"

Transdermal delivery of scopolamine (TS) has, however, been used successfully for the prevention of motion sickness. The purpose of this study was to determine if TS would decrease methacholine-induced bronchospasm in a group of subjects with mild asthma. Bronchoprovocational challenges with inhaled methacholine were performed on three separate occasions in 10 male subjects who each had a past history of asthma. After a baseline challenge, each subject received, in a double-blinded fashion, either a placebo patch or TS patch. The challenge was then repeated after at least 36 hours, and the alternate patch was then dispensed. The provocative dose producing a fall in FEV1 by 20% from baseline was then calculated by linear regression analysis. No significant change in baseline pulmonary function was noted with placebo patch or TS. With the use of TS, there was a small but significant increase in the provocative dose producing a fall in FEV1 by 20% from baseline for the group (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that a TS patch worn for a short period of time, can significantly decrease airway reactivity to methacholine in some patients with hyperactive airways.\r"

The mean (+/- SEM) age of the younger group was 33 +/- 3 years, in contrast to an age of 64 +/- 2 years for the older group. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly higher (two-way ANOVA, P less than .001) for three hours after a 75 g oral glucose challenge in the older group, as was the plasma insulin response (two-way ANOVA, P less than .001). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between age and total plasma glucose (r = 0.63, P less than .001) and insulin (r = 0.44, P less than .01) during the glucose tolerance test. However, the magnitude of the decrease in glucose tolerance with age was relatively modest. For example, total plasma glucose response was only 11% higher in the older group, and the plasma glucose concentration 120 minutes after the oral glucose load only increased approximately 2 mg/dL per decade. Glucose uptake during euglycemic clamp studies was also reduced in the older group, and this was true if the clamps were performed at plasma insulin concentration of approximately 10 microU/mL (P less than .05) or 60 microU/mL (P less than .10). However the differences were relatively modest in magnitude, ie, 10-25%. The fact that the increase in glucose uptake when plasma insulin was raised six-fold was similar in both groups suggests that insulin sensitivity does not decline with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anatomic abnormalities in the aging kidney include a decrease in kidney size, increased glomerular sclerosis, altered tubular structure, and an altered pattern of vascular flow. These anatomic abnormalities are associated with renal functional abnormalities, including decreased renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate. Altered renal tubular function, including impaired handling of water, sodium, acid, and glucose, may also be present. Impaired \"endocrinologic\" functioning manifested by changes in the renin-angiotensin system, vitamin D metabolism, and antidiuretic hormone responsiveness have been reported. The kidney is constantly exposed to the effects of a variety of potentially toxic processes. These range from environmental toxins and drugs, to a variety of chronic medical illnesses including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease. In this context, differentiation of \"aging\" effects from nephrotoxic effects resulting from these other processes is difficult. It has been argued that hypertension is an important factor in the development and progression of renal insufficiency in the elderly. The relationship between hypertension, glomerular hyperfiltration, atherosclerosis, and progressive renal dysfunction needs further study. Further research may allow the rational recommendation of interventions designed to control age-associated changes in renal function.\r"

When ANGII levels are inappropriately elevated, the antinatriuretic effects of ANGII cause increased arterial pressure, which then serves to maintain sodium and water balance via the pressure natriuresis mechanism. The primary intrarenal and extrarenal mechanisms by which ANGII controls renal excretion and arterial pressure include: (1) a direct effect of ANGII on tubular sodium transport; (2) a preferential constrictor action of ANGII on efferent arterioles, which increases sodium reabsorption by altering peritubular capillary physical forces (efferent arteriolar constriction also prevents excessive decreases in glomerular filtration rate when renal perfusion is compromised, such as in renal artery stenosis); and (3) extrarenal effects of ANGII, including stimulation of aldosterone secretion. Current evidence suggests that the direct effects of ANGII on the kidney are quantitatively more important than indirect effects mediated by aldosterone. In older hypertensives, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration are often suppressed, perhaps due to loss of functional nephrons and increased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa of the remaining nephrons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A number of techniques have been developed to control active upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. These include thermal devices such as the laser, heater probe, and bipolar circumactive probe (BICAP). Although these devices have proved effective, they vary in cost and at times are cumbersome to use. A simple, inexpensive, readily available means of treating active bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is injection of the lesion with a sclerosing substance. This method has proved helpful in stopping variceal hemorrhage, and the simplicity of the equipment and procedure makes it an outstanding candidate therapy for treating other causes of hemorrhage. Although the method is not well known in the United States, it has been applied in Japan and Europe. Most studies so far have been uncontrolled, but in over 700 patients reported in the world literature, effective initial hemostasis has been achieved in about 90% of patients overall. Success rates have been somewhat dependent on the site and rate of bleeding. No deaths have been reported from the procedure. We review the current status, techniques, and types of sclerosing agents and provide a detailed analysis of results of injection sclerotherapy. We propose that although the technique is simple, the effectiveness and routine application to the patient with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage await careful controlled studies and comparison with other available hemostatic methods.\r"

Immunoglobulin G from 5 of 9 BP sera bound the cell surfaces of SCC cells with a punctate staining pattern by immunofluorescence. The other four BP sera and all 12 controls sera showed no specific staining. To characterize the antigen for pemphigoid antibody, we immunoprecipitated NP-40 extracts of cells labeled with [14C] amino acids using nine BP sera and 12 controls sera. These immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by fluorography. The five BP sera that gave positive immunofluorescence results also precipitated a protein with molecular weight (mol wt) of 110 kD, whereas the other four BP sera negative by immunofluorescence and all 12 controls sera did not precipitate this protein. These results indicate that the sera of patients with BP contain antibodies against the protein with mol wt 110 kD in the SCC cells used in this study. With use of four BP sera, two of which were positive to this mol wt 110 kD BPA and two of which were negative, immunoprecipitation was carried out in Pam cells. One 110 kD-positive serum and two 110 kD-negative sera, precipitated a BPA of mol wt 220 kD from Pam cells labeled with [35S] methionine. These results suggest that BP sera may recognize more than one antigen, in addition to possible BPA heterogeneity in different individuals.\r"

To test the hypothesis that a circulating IgA class antibody in DH patients binds to constituents of normal human skin, we employed the highly sensitive methods of immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence. Sera from 64 DH patients, 67 randomly selected normal control subjects, 29 histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) B8/DR3/DQw2 controls, and 12 psoriatic patients were tested for IgA binding to various substrates, including dermal and epidermal extracts, fibroblast and keratinocyte supernatants, monkey esophagus sections, and whole and saline-split normal human skin sections. Significant differences observed among the groups in the frequency of detectable IgA antibodies reacting with various substrates were as follows: 1) IgA antibodies in 30% of both DH and HLA B8/DR3/DQw2 sera bound to a 60-Kd protein in dermal extracts (p less than 0.25 versus non-HLA matched controls); 2) IgA antiendomysial antibodies were present in 38% of DH patients (predominantly those not on gluten-free diets), whereas both normal control groups had frequencies of 5-10% (p less than 0.025); 3) there was more nonspecific IgA antibody-binding to dermal, epidermal, and bovine proteins in DH and HLA control sera than in normal sera; and 4) IgA antibodies directed against the basement membrane were present with an increased frequency of 25% in both DH and HLA B8/DR3/DQw2 sera (p less than 0.1 versus non-HLA matched controls). Therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis that there is an unique antigen within normal human skin to which IgA antibodies from DH sera bind.\r"

Previous observations suggested that the skin contains no blood vessels as late as eight weeks estimated gestational age (EGA). Computer reconstructions, in conjunction with light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), however, demonstrated that specimens as young as 35-45 d show a level of vascular complexity previously unknown. The computer reconstructions showed that the vasculature was organized in one or two planes parallel to the epidermis. A simple, single plane was evident in specimens 40-50 d EGA, whereas specimens 50-75 d EGA showed two planes. Fewer vessels were continuous throughout the tissue sample in the younger specimens compared with the older specimens. Superior views highlighted the continuities and connections of vessels. The younger specimens showed more discontinuous segments of vessels when compared with the network established in the older specimens. In the earliest specimens examined morphologically (35-40 d), simple, capillarylike vessels were morphologically identifiable in presumptive dermis. The samples studied by TEM revealed detailed structure of the vessel wall including extreme attenuations and projections, plasmalemmal vesicles, and junctions similar to adult endothelial cells. Little or no basal lamina surrounded the vessel. The basal lamina first appeared in the form of amorphous deposits and eventually thickened and became continuous. By the end of the first trimester, the basal lamina still lacked the organization of adult cutaneous arterial and venous segments. These findings suggest that the major vascular organization of the dermis is defined in the first trimester of development.\r"

  ".W": "Much has been learned in the past two decades about the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on human biology. These distinctive fatty acids are derived principally from marine sources such as fish and fish oil. They are rapidly incorporated into cell membranes after their ingestion in the diet and subsequently may alter a myriad of cellular functions. For example, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid may inhibit the synthesis of several prostaglandins and leukotrienes, as well as reduce the cellular production of cytokines or growth factors such as interleukin-1 or platelet-derived growth factor. Some of these functional changes found after fish-oil ingestion may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of human disease. Studies are now underway to investigate the effect of fish-oil preparations or more-purified omega-3 fatty acids on arterial injury, thrombosis or atherosclerosis, as well as to study their effects in certain inflammatory or cutaneous disorders, such as psoriasis. This paper will review the current body of research on marine oils and will focus specifically on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in vascular biology and associated disease states. The potential toxicity of these fatty acids will be discussed, as well as current indications (or lack of them) for their therapeutic use in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Mast cells (MC) are widely distributed throughout different organs with a relative predilection for potential portals of entry into the host. In tissues, MC are generally concentrated around small blood vessels and lymphatics, as well as nerves and glandular tissue. This close association with vascular structures suggests an important interaction between MC and endothelial cells (EC). Tissue MC are known to generate and release a number of mediators including histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes that induce vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability. These MC-mediated effects on vessels may enhance responses to tissue injury or infection by facilitating the deposition of plasma components and inflammatory cells into involved sites. Important interactions between MC, EC, and peripheral nerves also occur. MC-derived histamine and possibly other mediators induce axon reflexes in unmyelinated sensory nerves leading to the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and adenine nucleotides. These neurotransmitters exert direct effects on blood vessels, and in some instances, may act as MC stimulators. In vitro studies indicate that MC also affect EC growth and new blood vessel formation. Mast cell-derived heparin has been implicated as an important cofactor in tumor-induced angiogenesis, whereas histamine has been reported to augment human dermal EC growth in culture. The recent identification of a tumor necrosis factor-like peptide in MC and the reported cytostatic effects of TNF on EC suggest that MC may inhibit the proliferation of these cells under certain conditions. Taken together, these observations indicate that the interactions between MC and EC are important in both physiologic and pathologic events.\r"

Their hemorrhagic clinical appearance contrasts the predominantly lymphatic histologic features of vessels in early lesions. Investigations performed to resolve the debate whether these tumors arise from blood vessel or lymphatic endothelium show remarkably similar results for both conditions. Electron microscopy reveals Weibel - Palade bodies in a minority of cases, but features consistent with less well-differentiated blood vessel endothelium may be seen in a greater proportion of tumors. Enzyme histochemistry generally shows absence of adenosine triphosphatase and alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells; a pattern of enzymes similar to that found in normal lymphatic endothelium. Conflicting data arises from the large number of immunohistochemical studies performed on both conditions. Factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I have been most frequently employed, but the specificity of these agents for blood vessel endothelium is debatable. Panendothelial markers show consistent labeling of both tumors, but marker studies employing a wide range of monoclonal antibodies specific for blood vessel endothelium have shown occasional positive labeling of tumor cells. A number of studies have claimed absence of labeling with specific blood vessel monoclonal antibodies, but at present no study employing a specific marker for lymphatic endothelium has been reported. Although the demonstration of specific markers for blood vessel endothelium in these tumors has been variable, the data would be compatible with lesions arising from undifferentiated stem cells that proliferate with varying degrees of differentiation toward blood vessel endothelium. An alternative hypothesis for the histogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma would be one of multicentric hyperplasia containing lymphatic venular anastamoses with elements of both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphatics are large vessels with a lumen potentially ten times wider than blood vessels and have a mean mesh diameter in the upper dermis of approximately 504 +/- 88 microns. The plexus lies just deep to the subpapillary venous plexus and when functioning well it is difficult to identify because of the attenuated endothelium and collapsed lumen. The role of the lymphatic as a pathway for the Langerhans cell and as an exit for macromolecules such as lipid and protein make it an essential organ for normal skin biology. When this system fails, impaired immunity, fibrosis, and recurrent infections are inevitable. Even vasculitis may be a consequence of failure of clearance of immune complexes from the interstitium. The adipose tissue and deep dermis are especially vulnerable in this respect. Elastin fibers support cutaneous lymphatics and may be low resistance pathways through the connective tissues into the lymphatic. Identification of lymphatics by special markers is a concept that currently fails to take into account that changing roles in disease may be associated with a change in the specificity of markers. The anatomy of lymphatic vessels in the skin is described and the role of the lymphatic is emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "The cutaneous microvasculature is organized into upper and lower horizontal plexuses with the dermal capillary loops arising from the upper plexus. The arteriolar and venular sides of the microvasculature can be identified by the ultrastructure of the mural basement membrane material. Collecting venules present in the lower dermis contain valves. Periadventitial cells (veil cells) are present around all microvessels. Their size and number appear to correlate with the quantity of mural basement membrane material found in cutaneous vessels in diabetes, actinic damage, and chronological aging. The contractile cells of the vascular wall surround the endothelial cell tube in a manner suggesting specific functions. The smooth muscle cells in the arteriolar segment form a sleeve, whereas each pericyte in the postcapillary venular simultaneously makes many contacts with several underlying endothelial cells. The common telangiectases can be explained by abnormalities in this organization and ultrastructure rather than by neovascularization or random anastomoses. The macular telangiectases seen in scleroderma, generalized essential telangiectasia, and nevus flammeus are produced by dilatation of the postcapillary venules of the upper horizontal plexus. Cherry angiomas are produced by spherical and tubular dilatations of capillary loops in dermal papillae with tortuous cross-connections between individual loops. Angiokeratomas of Fabry and Fordyce have the ultrastructure of collecting venules that contain valves, and appear to represent the ectopic development or placement of small valve-containing collecting veins. The cutaneous lesions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia represent arteriovenous communications.\r"

  ".W": "A review is given of human endothelial antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies and used as vascular markers. These antigens can be classified tentatively into two categories that partly overlap: 1) differentiation markers and 2) antigens involved in specific cellular functions. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing endothelial differentiation markers reacting with all types of human endothelium can be regarded as constitutive endothelial markers. Other differentiation markers have a restricted distribution that is associated with a subtype of endothelium. Although sensitivity of the markers is high in general, specificity for endothelium is not absolute, based on distribution studies in tissues or in cell lines. With the exception of PAL-E and EN-3/EN-4, it is not clear from the literature whether the antibodies also react with lymphatic endothelium. Immunohistochemical examination of other species indicate that only BW 200 is restricted to humans. Immunoelectron microscopy of microvascular cells in tissue specimens has revealed that the monoclonal antibodies recognizing differentiation antigens show different subcellular distribution patterns. PAL-E and BW 200 react with the luminal endothelial surface, in a local and diffuse pattern, respectively. Anti-Von Willebrand factor (i.e., Factor VIII-related ag) antibodies react with Weibel-Palade bodies but also with subendothelial structures. Applications of immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies in diagnostic pathology include assessment of vascular invasion by cancer cells, and identification of endothelial neoplasms and related disorders. Because anti-Factor VIII-related antigen and BW 200 are applicable on formaldehyde-fixed and paraplast-embedded tissue, they are most suitable for histodiagnostic application. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies recognizing endothelial antigens involved in specific cellular functions also may contribute to pathobiologic research on the characterization of blood-tissue barriers, e.g., in the tumor vascular bed.\r"

A new modified Iscove's medium supplemented with 2% pre-partum maternal serum, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, isobutyl methylxanthine, thymidine, and hypoxanthine is described. This modified medium supports growth of both adult and neonatal endothelial cells up to seven passages with retention of cytologic markers closely identified with endothelial cells (Weibel-Palade bodies, Factor VIII-associated antigen). Several functions associated with the microvasculature in situ are expressed by microvascular endothelial cells in cell culture. Such functions include the formation of a basement membrane, angiogenesis, intercelluar gap formation in response to vasoactive agents, and the attachment and migration of lymphocytes through endothelial monolayers.\r"

The results of these studies have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes produce factors, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), that induce the expression of multilineage hematopoietic growth factors by human vascular endothelial cells. In more recent studies we and others have identified these induced factors as G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1. Interleukin 1 stimulates expression of these genes by inducing the accumulation of gene transcripts. Moreover, transcript accumulation, at least with GM-CSF, results from prolongation of mRNA half-life. Based on preliminary studies in a cell-free system, we propose that the inductive capacity of IL-1 results from its activation of ribonuclease inhibitors in the cytoplasm of IL-1-induced cells and hypothesize that this may be a general mechanism by which IL-1 induces gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Adherence of circulating neutrophils to the microvascular endothelium is the initial step in diapedesis, the process by which leukocytes migrate through blood vessels to accumulate at sites of cutaneous disease or injury. The mechanisms underlying neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions are currently under intense investigation. It has now been clearly shown that human neutrophil adherence in vitro to cultured human endothelial cell monolayers can be enhanced by a variety of mediators of inflammation, that both the neutrophil and the endothelial cell may actively contribute to the adhesive interaction depending on the stimuli involved, and that the Mac-1, LFA-1, p150,95 glycoprotein family (CD11/CD18) plays a critical role. Chemotactic peptides (FMLP, C5a) and lipid mediators (LTB4, PAF) act primarily on the neutrophil to enhance its adherence to endothelium. The effect occurs quickly (maximal response within 2 min), can be rapidly modulated, and is dependent on the expression of CD11/CD18 on the neutrophil surface. In contrast, the cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce cultured human endothelial cells to increase their adhesivity for human neutrophils by a process that is time-dependent, requiring 4 to 6 h for maximal response, and involves de novo RNA and protein synthesis. Two adhesion molecules are induced on the surface of endothelium in response to cytokine activation: endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 is a ligand for LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). Thus, CD11/CD18 plays a central role in neutrophil adherence to endothelium stimulated by chemotactic factors or cytokines. However, much still remains to be explored to further understanding of the fascinating but complex interaction of circulating neutrophils and the microvascular endothelium during acute inflammatory reactions in the skin.\r"

  ".W": "The endothelial barrier in all organ beds allows the free exchange of water, but is restrictive to varying degrees to the transport of solutes such as albumin. For example, in the brain microvessels, the endothelial barrier restricts the transport of protein, whereas in fenestrated and continuous endothelial cells of the renal and lung endothelial cells, the endothelial barrier is semipermeable. The endothelial monolayer demonstrates selectivity, i.e., the permeation of molecules is inversely related to the molecular weight. Although the \"pore\" theory has been used to describe the transport across the endothelial barrier, the transport of solutes is also dependent on the charge of solutes and the endothelial cell, and the ability of the solute to bind to or be taken up by endothelial cells. Receptor-mediated trancytosis of albumin may contribute to albumin transport in addition to transport by paracellular pathways (i.e., through a so-called pore). Water permeability across the endothelium is determined by the interaction of albumin with glycocalyx and interstitial components of the endothelium (the \"fiber matrix\"). Ambient concentration of albumin serves to lower endothelial hydraulic conductivity. Increased endothelial permeability to solutes and water in inflammatory states is dependent on the shape and configuration of endothelial cells as determined by alterations in cytoskeletal elements, such as f-actin, and as regulated by intracellular second messengers such as free cytosolic calcium.\r"

  ".U": "89328004\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of the complement system is an important element in our concept of the pathomechanism of immune complex (IC) vasculitis. Both deposition of IC and attraction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are effected by products of complement activation. Actual tissue damage, however, is believed to be caused by PMN penetrating the vessel wall. Our former finding that deposits of membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) are found predominantly in skin lesions of patients with IC vasculitis and not in perilesional skin, has raised the question whether the complement system itself (by way of the MAC) contributes to tissue damage. Our present study shows the ultrastructural localization of MAC in lesional and clinically uninvolved skin in two patients with a cutaneous IC vasculitis. Lesional skin deposits of MAC were found on endothelial cells (EC) of upper dermal vessels and on infiltrating PMN. Uninvolved skin deposits of MAC were found on some EC, but clearly to a lesser extent than on EC of the lesional skin. In the skin of two healthy controls MAC was only found sporadically on EC. Deposits of MAC on EC in the lesional skin were often associated with a typical form of local cell swelling. This local form of endothelial cell swelling was incidentally seen in vessels of clinically uninvolved skin, but not in the skin of the two controls. The association of the endothelial cell swelling with deposits of MAC suggests that the complement system can have a direct damaging effect on EC in IC vasculitis by the assembly of MAC on the endothelial cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Complement activation by immune complexes induces inflammation, but during this process the nature of the complexes is altered. Once immune complexes have attained sufficient lattice to activate complement, further increase of the lattice and immune precipitation are limited by the incorporation of complement components. The presence of complement components in immune complexes facilitates their disposal from circulation by complement receptors on red cells in humans. Without complement activation the disposal of immune complexes of sufficient lattice is mediated by Fc receptors. The development of immune deposits in tissues can arise by several mechanisms. Circulating immune complexes may be deposited in a number of vascular beds. Immune deposits in tissues may also arise by local formation. This process may involve structural antigens in tissues, cell surface antigens that are shed after interaction with specific antibodies or antigens that have become planted in tissues and then combine with antibodies. Charge-charge interactions enhance deposition of immune complexes in several organs, involving fixed negative charges in tissues and positive charges on antigens or antibodies in immune complexes. Successful detection of immune deposits in dermal vessels requires the examination of fresh lesions. Local vascular changes contribute significantly to deposition of immune complexes in dermal vessels. Charge-charge interactions enhance this deposition and contribute to the development of deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction in experimental animals.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermotropic lymphocytes are an essential cellular component of the skin-associated lymphoid tissues (SALT). Dermal lymphocytic infiltrates are also characteristics of inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, although the mechanisms by which lymphocytes are recruited into these sites are not known. We have used an in vitro lymphocyte adherence assay to test the hypothesis that specialized endothelial cells are present in inflamed skin, and are capable of supporting lymphocyte adherence and promoting lymphocyte emigration. In this assay, we assessed the binding of lymphocytes overlaid onto frozen sections of normal and psoriatic skin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients, from healthy volunteers, and from rat thoracic duct bound specifically to dermal endothelia in psoriatic plaques, in steroid-resistant areas of plaques, but not in uninvolved skin or skin from healthy individuals. Analysis of the binding properties of lymphocyte subsets revealed preferential adherence by CD4+ T cells as compared with CD8+ T cells and to B cells. Interestingly, PBMC from patients undergoing ultraviolet light therapy failed to adhere to autologous skin or to lesion-containing skin sections from untreated patients. Additional studies indicate that the lymphocyte-endothelial interaction is an energy- and calcium-dependent process and involves surface glycoprotein and carbohydrate moieties, requirements similar to those found in specific lymphocyte interactions with high endothelial venules in lymph nodes during the homing process. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with antibodies directed against homing receptors mediating migration into lymph nodes and into gut-associated lymphoid tissues, however, did not interfere with lymphocyte adherence to psoriatic endothelium. In contrast, anti-lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA)-1 antibody partially inhibited lymphocyte binding to chronic plaques. We conclude that a tissue-specific receptor/ligand interaction independent of LFA-1 directs lymphocyte emigration from the dermal microvasculature into the psoriatic dermis and that LFA-1 plays only an accessory role in the adhesion process.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes preferentially leave the bloodstream to enter secondary lymphoid organs or sites of inflammation by first adhering to, and then migrating through, the walls of specialized postcapillary venules known as high endothelial venules. To study the initial adhesion event between lymphocytes and endothelial cells, two different in vitro assays have been developed. In the first, lymphocytes are incubated on frozen sections of lymphoid organs or other tissues. Under certain conditions, lymphocytes specifically bind to the endothelial cells of high endothelial venules in such sections. The results of monoclonal antibody inhibition studies have suggested that endothelial cells at various lymphoid organs, and at certain inflammatory lesions, may express organ-specific ligands on their surface, which bind to corresponding organ-specific \"homing receptors\" on the lymphocytes. The second assay measures the adhesion of lymphocytes to confluent monolayers of viable, cultured endothelial cells. Because pretreatment of such cell monolayers with a number of cytokines produced at inflammatory sites stimulates an increase in the adhesiveness of the cells for lymphocytes, it has been suggested that such cytokine-induced increases in endothelial cell adhesiveness may be important in the induction of lymphocyte traffic into such lesions. Unlike the homing receptor type of binding described above, the cytokine-induced increase in lymphocyte-endothelial cell adhesion is presumably non-tissue-specific. Results of monoclonal antibody inhibition studies in this system have suggested that at least two ligand-receptor interactions may be involved. Monoclonal antibodies to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 greatly inhibited the adhesion of T cells to untreated endothelial cells, but had little or no inhibitory effect on T-cell adhesion to cytokine-treated endothelial cells.\r"

This dermal perivascular dendritic macrophage was seen in greatest density in the superficial vascular plexus and appears to constitute a large percentage of the total dermal macrophage population. Because tissue macrophages do not always share the same immunologic repertoire as circulating monocytes/macrophages, we became interested in examining the functional immunologic capabilities of this dermal dendritic macrophage. A procedure was developed to isolate and partially purify these cells from normal human newborn foreskin. Preliminary findings are compatible with the possibility that these cells possess the capacity to present alloantigens to CD4+ T cells. The potential immunologic function of this dermal perivascular macrophage is discussed in the context of its possible interactions with the other cellular components of the dermal microvascular unit (i.e., microvascular endothelial cells, perivascular T cells, and mast cells).\r"

Studies were then carried out to compare the effects of CsA, and the nonselective cytodepletive agents irradiation and cyclophosphamide, on both host defenses and the bacteriologic status of chronically infected kidneys. Two different responses were observed. In animals treated with CsA, bacterial numbers increased markedly, although circulating neutrophil numbers were relatively unaffected. This observation was in contrast to the severe ablation of leukocyte numbers and competence needed to achieve an equivalent effect when irradiation and cyclophosphamide were used. One possible explanation for the adverse effect of CsA on the host-parasite balance in chronic pyelonephritis is that CsA affects mediators that control the inflammatory response or induces a qualitative change in a critical cellular defense compartment.\r"

To clarify the molecular basis of the insulin resistance, we investigated the insulin binding and kinase properties of the insulin receptor and the receptor gene in cultured skin fibroblasts of two patients (Ark-1 and Ark-2) with leprechaunism and in those of three of their parents. Specific insulin binding to fibroblasts was markedly reduced (less than 25% of control) in both patients with leprechaunism but was essentially normal in the parents. In contrast, insulin receptor autophosphorylation in 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates was reduced in both patients and parents. In Ark-1, the 70% reduction in autophosphorylation correlated with the decrease in binding, whereas in Ark-2 and in the three parents included in the study, autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was reduced below the level accounted for by a change in receptor content. Analysis of the insulin receptor gene by hybridization with the receptor cDNA probes revealed no gross defect in either Ark-1 or Ark-2. Both parents of Ark-2 were heterozygous for a restriction fragment length polymorphism in the beta-subunit detected with Bam HI digestion (observed in 15% of controls). Ark-2 was homozygous for the more common allele of this polymorphism (observed in 84% of controls). Thus, we have biochemically characterized a new family of leprechaunism (Ark-2) and have found insulin receptor phosphorylation defects in their phenotypically normal parents.\r"

All the patients were given a device to measure their blood pressure at home and had monthly checks at a health centre. Two hundred patients on antihypertensive drugs (G1) started additional non-pharmacological therapy after 1 year in the study, while the rest (G2) had used it from the beginning. Antihypertensive drugs were withdrawn according to predetermined criteria. The drop-out rate was 1.5% each year. Medication was withdrawn completely from 42.7% of G1, and in 21.5% it was withheld for at least 18 months. The corresponding figures for G2 were 46.4% and 25.5% respectively. Most of the medication withdrawal in G1 occurred during the first year, when the group's management consisted solely of blood pressure measurements at home and frequent visits to the health centre. Serum triglycerides decreased on non-pharmacological treatment in both sexes in both groups. Life quality improved, particularly for the group (n = 173) that had the drugs withdrawn.\r"

Seventy-two healthy persons (36 males and 36 females) served as controls. Only minor differences in plasma zinc were demonstrated during the first 2 years of IDDM. A sex difference was found in healthy controls but only after 24 months in the diabetics. Quantitative changes of the B-cell function, development of insulin antibodies, age, body weight and serum albumin did not correlate with the course of plasma zinc.\r"

Subjects were asked to record daily in a special diary (1) the presence or absence of headache, (2) duration of headache, (3) severity of headache, and (4) use of pain medication for headache relief. The severity of the headaches was rated from 1 (very mild) to 5 (very severe). Although the subjects reported a decrease in frequency, duration, and intensity of headaches while using the medicated patch, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Nineteen patients subjectively preferred the medicated patch, while five preferred the placebo (P less than .01). During use of the medicated patch, a significant reduction (P = .039) occurred in use of class II narcotics. Three doses of these substances were used by the patients when treated with clonidine, while 34 doses were taken during placebo use. These findings suggest that clonidine might have a role in reduction of parenteral narcotic use in acute pain syndromes.\r"

  ".U": "89328445\r", 
  ".W": "Consideration is given to how and why categories of ill health are divided into diseases. Aetiology is a fundamental criterion for the delineation of individual diseases. The same clinical and pathological picture may have many different causes; for example meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis are distinct diseases that may display the same symptoms and signs. On the other hand, a single aetiology may lead to quite separate clinical and pathological phenomena; for example, neurosyphilis is a disorder that can present with general paresis or tabes dorsalis (or any combination of the two). In attempting to find a nosological placement for Parkinson's disease, we must take into account the extensive overlap with idiopathic dementia (Alzheimer's disease). Present evidence raises the possibility of several causes for Parkinson's disease, some of which may also be responsible for idiopathic dementia. A classification in accord with its position is desirable, and as a first step it would be helpful to replace \"Parkinson's disease\" with a term that is not saddled with implications of a single causal mechanism. \"Idiopathic Parkinsonism\" is suitable nomenclature for what is really a syndrome of unknown origin.\r"

  ".W": "The primary pathological change in Parkinson's disease is the destruction of dopamine containing cells in the zona compacta of substantia nigra. The cause of nigral cell death and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. However, the discovery of the selective nigral neurotoxin MPTP and its ability to inhibit mitochondrial energy metabolism via its metabolite MPP+ and to generate superoxide radicals suggests processes by which nigral cell death might occur. Recent postmortem evidence in brain tissue from patients dying with Parkinson's disease also suggests the occurrence of some on-going toxic mechanism. This may be a free radical process stimulated by an excess of iron within substantia nigra coupled to a generalised decrease in brain ferritin content. These data suggest altered iron handling occurs in Parkinson's disease which may lead to the generation of toxic oxygen species such as superoxide radicals. There is also evidence for an inhibition of mitochondrial function in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease. So there may be a close association between the actions of the synthetic neurotoxin MPTP and the underlying cause of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\r"

Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate that the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and that progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Re-distribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction, the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intra-duodenal administration of levodopa.\r"

In this article, the history and nosology of the condition are considered, and provisional diagnostic criteria are advanced. The usefulness (or otherwise) of ancillary investigations is addressed, and the shortcomings of current methods of treatment are stressed. As with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, the ultimate goal of eradicating the disease entails better diagnosis in order to establish the cause, and thence to develop a radical treatment capable of preventing or arresting the disease process.\r"

  ".W": "From July 1984 to September 1987, 737 patients with aggressive malignant lymphoma (ML) were treated by an intensive regimen (LNH-84) comprising three or four courses of doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 1,200 mg/m2; vindesine, 2 mg/m2 x 2; bleomycin, 10 mg x 2; and prednisolone, 60 mg/m2 x 5 (ACVB), consolidation with high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, asparaginase, and cytarabine, and a randomized late intensification with two courses of cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, teniposide, bleomycin, and prednisone (AraCVmB). Four hundred forty-two patients had intermediate-grade ML, 221 highgrade ML, and 74 unclassified ML. Most of the patients had advanced disease: stage IIE (23%), III (13%), or IV (47%); 38% disseminated nodes; 38% two or more extranodal sites; and 41% a tumoral mass greater than 10 cm. Five hundred fifty-three patients (75%) went into complete remission (CR), 63 (9%) into partial remission, 62 (8%) failed to respond, and 59 (8%) died during ACVB courses, 17 of them from progression of the disease. With a median follow-up of 23 months, the estimated 2-year overall survival time to failure (TTF), and time to relapse (TTR) survival are 67%, 56%, and 67%, respectively. Patients receiving a late intensification had the same relapse rate as the other patients. A persistent fibronecrotic mass was found in 150 patients (20%) and did not influence the relapse rate. Toxicity was mainly neutropenia and infection during the ACVB courses, with 40 patients (5%) dying from septic complications while responding to treatment. Fifty-three percent of the patients had a neutropenia less than 0.500 x 10(9)/L, 58% fever (6% grade 4), and 49% a documented infection (8% grade 4). These results obtained with the LNH-84 regimen demonstrate that this therapeutic scheme is an effective treatment for aggressive ML.\r"

Sequential dosimetric studies were performed with escalating amounts of antibody MB-1 (0.5, 2.5, 10 mg/kg) trace-labeled with 5 to 10 mCi 131I. Serial tumor biopsies and gamma camera imaging showed that the 10 mg/kg MoAb dose yielded the best MoAb biodistribution in the ten patients studied. Biodistribution studies in the five patients with splenomegaly and tumor burdens greater than 1 kg indicated that not all tumor sites would receive more radiation than normal organs, and these patients were therefore not treated with high-dose radioimmunotherapy. The other five patients did not have splenomegaly and had tumor burdens less than 0.5 kg; all five patients in this group showed preferential localization and retention of MoAb at tumor sites. Four of these patients have been treated with 131I (232 to 608 mCi) conjugated to anti-CD37 MoAb MB-1, delivering 850 to 4,260 Gy to tumor sites. Each of these four patients attained a complete tumor remission (lasting 4, 6, 11+, and 8+ months). A fifth patient, whose tumor did not express the CD37 antigen, was treated with 131I-labeled anti-CD20 MoAb 1F5 and achieved a partial response. Myelosuppression occurred 3 to 5 weeks after treatment in all cases, but there were no other significant acute toxicities. Normal B cells were transiently depleted from the bloodstream, but immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were not affected, and no serious infections occurred. Two patients required reinfusion of previously stored autologous, purged bone marrow. Two patients developed asymptomatic hypothyroidism 1 year after therapy. The tolerable toxicity and encouraging efficacy warrant further dose escalation in this phase I trial.\r"

One patient is alive and free of progression 29 months after transplantation.

  ".W": "Among 131 boys with advanced (stage III or IV) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) consecutively treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, testicular involvement was present at the time of diagnosis in six and as an isolated site of relapse in three. Testicular involvement was not seen in any patient with localized (stage I or II) disease. Four of the six patients with involvement at presentation are free of disease 2.9+ to 8.3+ years after diagnosis, following chemotherapy alone (three patients) or chemotherapy plus orchiectomy. Overt testicular relapse while on therapy resulted in death from progressive disease in two patients; the third relapsed after completing therapy for Burkitt's lymphoma and is in second remission after chemotherapy, orchiectomy, and scrotal irradiation. The prolonged remissions seen in children with testicular involvement at diagnosis suggest that scrotal irradiation may not be necessary in chemosensitive disease. By contrast, testicular relapse on therapy appears to indicate drug-resistant disease and a poor prognosis, despite testicular irradiation and chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The response to and survival following first salvage therapy regimens for 243 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated between 1974 and 1985 were evaluated. Eighty (33%) patients obtained a complete remission (CR), 24% died prior to achieving a response, and 43% were resistant on their first salvage regimen. The median survival was 18 weeks. Five percent overall and 16% of the CR patients are predicted to survive for more than 5 years. The factor most strongly associated with response and survival was the duration of the initial remission with 49 of 82 (60%) patients whose initial CR duration was at least 1 year in duration obtaining a second CR v 31 of 161 (19%) for patients with a shorter remission (P less than .01). Age, liver function, serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), karyotype, and the proportion of blasts plus promyelocytes present at the time of starting salvage therapy were strongly associated with probability of response and survival. Multivariate analysis was used to develop logistic regression and proportional hazard models to predict probability of response and survival, respectively. The major regimens used were conventional-dose cytarabine (ara-C) (combined with anthracyclines or amsacrine), high-dose ara-C, rubidazone, amsacrine (AMSA), other anthracyclines, and autologous or allogeneic transplant programs. After allowing for the prognostic factors in the models, specific treatment regimens were not strongly associated with prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "High-dose ketoconazole (400 mg orally three times a day) and physiologic replacement doses of glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone, 20 mg 8 AM, 10 mg 4 PM, and 8 PM) were administered to 38 patients with advanced prostatic cancer, refractory to at least initial testicular androgen deprivation. Thirty patients were completely evaluable; six were withdrawn due to possible ketoconazole-related toxicity and were considered drug failures. Two patients were unevaluable due to intercurrent therapy or inability to maintain follow-up. Ketoconazole was generally well tolerated. Mild or moderate nausea and vomiting occurred in 37% of patients, but required dose modification or discontinuation in only three patients; no hepatic damage was seen. Five of 36 patients (14%) responded to ketoconazole as determined by palpable or radiographic tumor mass reduction of 50% or greater and normalization of acid phosphatase or bone scan. Fifty percent of patients entered were stable at 90 days. Plasma androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were reduced markedly in almost all patients. Plasma testosterone (T) levels were low and remained unchanged, while gonadotropins were persistently elevated. Mean plasma ketoconazole content was 6.6 micrograms/mL after 28 days of therapy. While ketoconazole with hydrocortisone does suppress plasma androgens in advanced prostatic cancer patients, this infrequently causes regression of cancer that has progressed despite adequate testicular androgen ablation.\r"

  ".U": "89328493\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1982 and 1986, 34 patients with advanced metastatic seminoma were treated with four to six courses of single-agent carboplatin administered at 400 mg/m2 every 4 weeks either on an outpatient basis or during 24-hour admissions. Patients with raised serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) or with multiple (more than three) lung metastases were excluded since these features may indicate a nonseminomatous component. In this series 20 patients were previously untreated except for orchiectomy, and 14 patients had received prior radiotherapy restricted to infradiaphragmatic nodal areas. Treatment was extremely well tolerated. No patient suffered renal damage, neurotoxicity, or ototoxicity, and there were no episodes of neutropenic septicemia, thrombocytopenic hemorrhage, or bruising. The actuarial 2-year survival was 94% (95% confidence intervals, 83% to 100%) with follow-up of 12 to 46 months from completion of carboplatin (mean, 26 months). The actuarial chance of remaining alive and free from progressive disease at 2 years was 80% (95% confidence intervals, 66% to 94%). Of six patients who relapsed, five are currently in remission 9 to 18 months after completion of salvage treatment. This level of antitumor activity is equivalent to that seen with aggressive combination regimens. Single-agent carboplatin should be considered the treatment of choice for advanced stages of malignant seminoma when limitation of toxicity is considered important; however, the rarity, especially of extranodal metastases from seminoma, leads to the need for further investigation using this approach.\r"

  ".W": "Three-hundred thirty-two cases of pleural diffuse malignant mesothelioma (DMM) seen at large centers in Ontario and Quebec from 1965 to 1984 were reviewed retrospectively. Previous asbestos exposure was found in 44% of patients. Diagnosis was most often made by exploratory thoracotomy; pleural biopsy or cytology were rarely contributory. The delay in diagnosis was often long (median time, 3.5 months) and thrombocytosis (platelets greater than or equal to 400,000/microL) was common (41% of cases). The median survival (MS) was only 9 months. Eleven clinical variables were analyzed for prognostic significance. The three most important prognostic factors using a univariate analysis were stage, weight loss, and histologic type. For 118 patients with complete data, multivariate analysis showed that the stage of disease, high platelet count, and asbestos exposure were the most important prognostic factors. There was no cure of DMM, and we did not find any drastic differences in survival among groups of patients subjected to the different therapeutic measures. Radical surgery and radiotherapy were ineffective and we confirmed the low response rate to chemotherapeutic agents. This large retrospective trial can serve as a baseline for future studies in this field. In particular, it provides the basis for appropriate stratification variables to be used in future therapeutic trials.\r"

Changes in V and Q were determined from in vivo scintigraphic measurements in four lung regions with inhaled radioactive 81mKr, and infused 81mKr/dextrose and/or [99mTc]MAA as PEEP was applied at 2, 4, and 6 cm H2O in each animal. Dynamic compliance varied between 0.02 and 0.40 ml/cm H2O, which was consistent with surfactant deficiency. As PEEP was increased, the regional distribution of Q shifted from the rostral to the caudal lung regions (p less than 0.02 to less than 0.05), while that of V remained unchanged. Regional V/Q matching improved together with a trend towards improvement of arterial blood gases as PEEP was increased from 2 to 4 cm H2O. Pulmonary scintigraphy offers a noninvasive methodology for the quantitative assessment of regional V and Q matching in preterm lambs and may be clinically applicable to ventilated neonates.\r"

However, the recognition that several metabolic effects of selenium are not associated with glutathione peroxidase has forced a re-evaluation of the function of this enzyme and the element. Hepatic glutathione peroxidase contains a significant percentage of the regulated selenium in the rat and is more sensitive to selenium deficiency than other selenoproteins. Thus, in addition to its enzymatic activity, it might have a storage function for the element. Another selenoprotein, designated selenoprotein P, has been found in rat plasma and has been quantitated. Its function is not yet known, but it has been postulated to be a transport protein for selenium and a defense against oxidant stress. Understanding the nutritional effects of selenium will require better characterization of glutathione peroxidase, selenoprotein P and other selenoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence for the influence of trace elements on disease resistance in ruminants is reviewed with emphasis on susceptibility to infection in vivo during the more common deficiencies (copper, selenium and cobalt). Copper deficiency associated with increases in pasture molybdenum increased the susceptibility of lambs to microbial infections. Under experimental conditions, dietary molybdenum decreased the establishment of abomasal and intestinal nematodes but not their pathogenicity to lambs. Molybdenum may enhance inflammatory responses leading to parasite rejection by the host. Decreased incidence of metritis in selenium-treated dairy cows provides a rare example of an association between selenium deficiency and decreased disease resistance. Improved antibody responses following selenium administration have also been found in sheep. Cobalt deficiency has reduced lamb survival and increased susceptibility to parasitic infection transiently in cattle and lastingly in sheep. In copper-, selenium- or cobalt-deficient sheep and cattle, there are many reports of impaired leucocyte and lymphocyte responses to in vitro challenges, but their relevance to disease resistance in vivo is unproven. Disease resistance may have priority for limited micronutrient supplies, leaving other processes vulnerable.\r"

Modified 500-ml Bellco culture chambers were continuously infused with buffered medium containing vitamin mix, deoxycholate, urea, hemin, casein and mucin. Cultures were fed a mixture of minerals, sucrose, starch and either psyllium husk or cellulose twice daily. Chambers were inoculated with fecal or colonic samples obtained from adult male African green monkeys fed the respective fiber source in a purified diet for more than 3 yr. After a 5-d stabilization period, samples were collected for total viable anaerobe and aerobe counts, microbial beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) activity, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and ammonia nitrogen concentrations, dry matter, pH and oxidation-reduction potential. Inoculation with fecal material or colon contents produced similar results for the above mentioned characteristics; major differences were found due to the fiber treatments. Psyllium-fed cultures had lower pH (P less than 0.01) and higher VFA concentration (P less than 0.01) and beta-glucuronidase activity (P less than 0.10) than cellulose-fed cultures. The ratio of anaerobes to aerobes was lower (P less than 0.01) in psyllium-fed than in cellulose-fed cultures. These results indicate that feces can be used as an inoculum source for in vitro studies of changes in colonic microbial metabolism due to diet, and that dietary fiber source affects the colonic microbial population and metabolism.\r"

As vitamin A intake increased, progressively smaller fractions of the administered vitamin A were recovered in tissue. The decrease in fractional recovery in the tissues examined was calculated from the differences between intake, tissue level and excretion, and was found to increase after administration of high vitamin A diets. This could be explained, at least in part, on the basis of an enhanced rate of vitamin A degradation as a function of the increased concentration of retinol in the liver. At high tissue retinol concentrations, calculated rates of retinol metabolism via the hepatic cytosolic retinol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) and the recently discovered microsomal retinol dehydrogenase and oxidase vastly exceeded the decrease in fractional recovery of vitamin A accumulation in the tissues. This calculated rise in metabolic rate was verified by a corresponding increase in urinary polar metabolites derived from labeled retinol. Thus, accelerated catabolism as a function of increased hepatic vitamin A concentration may provide a homeostatic mechanism which offsets in part excessive vitamin A accumulation.\r"

Major malformations were found in two IVF and one non-IVF subject; the rates were not significantly different. The mean Mental Development Index scores for IVF subjects and the comparison group were 115 +/- 13 and 111 +/- 13, respectively (p = 0.12). The mean Psychomotor Development Index scores were 114 +/- 14 and 108 +/- 15 (p = 0.04). Based on these small numbers but extensive evaluation, we found no association between conception by IVF and an increased risk for congenital malformations. Likewise, children conceived by IVF showed no evidence of developmental delay. Their high average achievement on the Bayley tests probably resulted from the exceptional motivation of their parents (\"wantedness\") and their generally high socioeconomic status.\r"

Fatty alcohol: nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (FAO) activity was deficient in cultured skin fibroblasts (mean 18% of normal, n = 8) and peripheral blood leukocytes (mean 22% of normal, n = 3) from patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. The palmitoyl coenzyme A-inhibitable component of FAO activity was decreased to 10% and 15% of normal in fibroblasts and leukocytes, respectively, of patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. Most affected patients accumulated long-chain fatty alcohol in plasma, with a greater relative accumulation of octadecanol (mean threefold greater than normal) than hexadecanol (mean twofold greater than normal). Erythrocyte lipid alkyl ether linkages derived from hexadecanol were slightly increased in three of four patients. Fibroblasts and leukocytes from heterozygotes with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome showed mean FAO activities that were intermediate between those seen in homozygotes and in normal control subjects. The heterozygotes had normal fatty alcohol concentrations in plasma. These studies demonstrate FAO deficiency in patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, and suggest that accumulation of fatty alcohol or its metabolic products may be important in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

As neonates, all patients had hypertension and elevated plasma renin activity. Of 11 patients studied with radionuclide renography and scintigraphy, 10 had abnormal renal blood flow; three had complete absence of unilateral perfusion. On follow-up examination all children were normotensive; five children ages 5 to 24 months required antihypertensive medication. Of 15 children, 14 had normal statural growth; all had normal serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, and calculated glomerular filtration rate values. Patients with complete absence of renal perfusion unilaterally remained functionally anephric; children with less severe perfusion deficits had improved perfusion as shown by radionuclide renography and scintigraphy. We believe that many patients with aortic thrombosis and renovascular hypertension who have had aggressive antihypertensive therapy in the neonatal period will have good renal function and increased perfusion to the affected kidney 2 years later.\r"

We hypothesized that severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV) is associated with impaired visual-motor function, in part because of compression-related injury of the periventricular white matter by ventricular dilation. Infants with grade III or IV hemorrhage had significantly more neurologic sequelae at term and at 3, 7, 12, and 24 months; lower Bayley mental and motor scores at 3, 7, and 12 months; more abnormality on Kohen-Raz subscales for eye-hand coordination, object manipulation, and object relations at 3, 7, and 12 months; and lower Mullen vision-receptive and vision-expressive coordination scores at 24 months. The 12-month visual-evoked response correlated with the 24-month vision-receptive and vision-expressive organization scores for infants with grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage (r = -0.49, p less than 0.01, and r = -0.40, p less than 0.05, respectively). The data confirm our hypotheses of increased cognitive and neurologic sequelae, and increased abnormality of visual-motor coordination, during the first 2 years of life in infants with severe (grade III or IV) intraventricular hemorrhage.\r"

In a large, placebo-controlled trial, nausea and hematologic toxicity, but not fever, occurred more frequently in zidovudine- than in placebo-treated patients. However, in an open label study, fever severe enough to halt zidovudine administration occurred in 10% of 70 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients receiving the drug. We now describe three AIDS patients with severe zidovudine-induced fever in whom other causes of fever were excluded. Zidovudine-induced fever was confirmed in each case by drug rechallenge. Using an enzyme immunoassay, we detected IgM antibodies directed against a zidovudine-serum protein conformational determinant in one of these three patients. Neither IgG nor IgM anti-zidovudine antibodies were present in sera from the other two patients with zidovudine fever, from four AIDS patients who discontinued zidovudine for reasons other than fever, or from five AIDS patients who never received zidovudine. Zidovudine may cause fever as a severe adverse effect in patients with AIDS. Either type III or type IV hypersensitivity may mediate this reaction.\r"

Gp Ib and gp IIb-IIIa positive intravascular platelet aggregates were not seen, except locally in the capillary blood vessels of one rheumatoid synovial sample. This suggests that the platelets and the clotting sequence are not activated in inflamed synovial tissue. However, in many of the synovial capillaries endothelial immunoreactivity was seen. This reaction could have been due to cross reaction, since the vitronectin receptor beta chain is structurally identical to platelet gp IIIa. The gp IIb-IIIa member of the integrin receptor family plays a role in the transmembrane linkage between its extracellular ligands and intracellular microfibers. Gp IIb-IIIa may thus contribute to normal synovial physiology and to the pathogenesis of chronic synovitis.\r"

We therefore hypothesized that coagulation pathways, which promote fibrin formation, would be activated in the alveolar lining fluids of patients with rheumatoid interstitial lung disease. To test this hypothesis, we studied the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients with rheumatoid interstitial lung disease (n = 7) and patients with RA unassociated with interstitial lung disease (n = 10) to characterize and quantitatively compare the BAL procoagulant material and levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), which is cleaved from fibrinogen by thrombin. FPA reactive peptide concentrations were significantly greater in rheumatoid interstitial lung disease than RA when normalized per ml of concentrated BAL fluid (p = 0.02), per mg BAL total protein (p = 0.01) or BAL albumin content (p = 0.03) and correlated with BAL antigenic neutrophil elastase concentrations (r = 0.87). Procoagulant activity was present in similar concentration of BAL of patients with RA and rheumatoid interstitial lung disease and was mainly attributable to tissue factor associated with factor VII (or VIIa). Our results demonstrate that tissue factor and factor VII are endogenous in the alveoli of subjects with RA and interstitial lung disease and could interact with distal coagulation substrates which may enter the alveoli in interstitial lung disease to locally promote fibrin deposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight (16.3%) of these patients developed clinically apparent aseptic necrosis. In 12 of these 28 the continuous glucocorticosteroid dose was known. These 12 patients were compared to 15 controls with SLE followed for a minimum of 4.5 years for whom continuous glucocorticosteroid dosage was also known. We were unable to find any significant differences between patients with aseptic necrosis and controls in prevalence of specific lupus organ system involvement, Raynaud's phenomenon, or abnormal serological or hematological variables. Overall disease activity at the time of maximal glucocorticosteroid dosage did not differ significantly between the 2 groups but was slightly greater at the time SLE was diagnosed in the group with aseptic necrosis. Glucocorticosteroid intake during the first 1.5 years after diagnosis of SLE and during the third year after diagnosis was significantly greater for the patients with aseptic necrosis than for the control patients, as was glucocorticosteroid intake during the maximal 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy. We conclude that glucocorticosteroid intake is the major factor predisposing to aseptic necrosis in patients with SLE.\r"

Substantial pairwise correlations among assay methods were found (r = 0.544 to 0.804; p less than 0.001). In addition, anti-dsDNA antibody levels as measured by each assay were inversely correlated with levels of the 3rd component of complement. Our results indicate that changes in antibody levels as determined by these 3 methods closely parallel each other over time, and suggest that the array of anti-dsDNA antibodies detected in patient sera remains relatively constant over time.\r"

Using a polyclonal antiserum to cartilage matrix glycoprotein, we studied this protein in cartilage from normal immature and mature dogs to determine if it changes with maturation. Cartilage matrix glycoprotein from immature canine cartilage migrates as a doublet, with apparent molecular weights of 100-116,000, regardless of its state of reduction, and is immunologically cross reactive with cartilage matrix glycoprotein from adult canine cartilage. Cartilage matrix glycoprotein from mature canine cartilage is disulfide bonded before reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol and its 116,000 Da subunit migrates as a single band after reduction.\r"

  ".W": "Iron (Fe) depletion with anti-transferrin (Tf) receptor monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), Fe chelators, or gallium (Ga) salts inhibits in vitro and in vivo growth of tumor cells. The present studies examined the cytotoxic effects of an IgA anti-human Tf receptor MAb, 42/6, combined with parabactin, a powerful Fe chelator, or Ga nitrate. Parabactin inhibited in vitro growth of human hematopoietic and solid tumor cells, and the rank order of their sensitivities to the Fe chelator was identical to their relative sensitivity to MAb 42/6 as demonstrated in previous studies. When the most parabactin and MAb 42/6-sensitive (HL60 leukemia) and -resistant (KB carcinoma) cells were incubated with various concentrations of parabactin, cell killing was time and dose dependent over the first 24 hours. Little additional cytotoxicity occurred, however, when cells were exposed to parabactin for 48 hours. HL60 cells were slightly more sensitive than KB cells to parabactin cytotoxicity. Addition of optimally effective concentrations of anti-Tf receptor MAb 42/6 to parabactin increased cytotoxicity to HL60 cells over a narrow parabactin dose range but had little effect on cytotoxicity to KB cells. Cell cycle analysis of cells treated with parabactin for 24 hours showed that doses causing variable cytotoxicity increased the percentage of cells in S phase, but higher parabactin concentrations consistently arrested cells in G1 phase or at the G1/S interface. MAb 42/6 also increased toxicity of parabactin to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors and normal marrow granulocyte/macrophage progenitors. When HL60 or KB cells were treated with MAb 42/6 combined with Ga nitrate, MAb 42/6 increased cytotoxicity of Ga for HL60 cells but had little or no effect on Ga cytotoxicity to KB cells. In contrast, MAb 42/6 had minimal effects on cytotoxicity of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, isoquinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, to either HL60 or KB cells. Both hematopoietic and solid tumors were killed by Fe depletion, but the present studies suggested that hematopoietic cells are more sensitive than solid tumor cells to cytotoxic effects of Fe depletion. Combined Fe depletion therapy by the use of MAb 42/6 with an Fe chelator or Ga salt increased toxicity to MAb 42/6-sensitive cells, such as HL60, but was not more effective against MAb 42/6-resistant solid tumor cells. Combination Fe depletion therapy of hematopoietic cell tumors merits evaluation in experimental in vivo tumor systems.\r"
