  ".W": "A basic element in the determination of the zygosity of a twin pair is the proportion of genotypically concordant pairs among the dizygotic pairs. Two methods to derive this proportion are in common use: the first method requires a laborious enumeration of parental genotypic mating types, and the second method relies on a set of formulas, one for each of the possible combinations of genotypes of two full sibs. In this paper the relation between both methods is uncovered. The set of formulas of the second method is reduced to a single general formula, of which the connection with the ITO method (Li and Sacks 1954) is indicated. By applying both methods in turn to an example concerning the MNS blood group system (Fisher 1951), Fisher's way of performing the calculations according to the first method is unraveled, and the preferability of the second method is made clear. Next, formulas are derived for the probability of genotypic or phenotypic concordance of dizygotic twins when direct information on the genotype or phenotype of one of the parents is available. The case of an X-linked locus is also considered. To facilitate applications, tables are given.\r"

Data were analyzed after grouping the probands in four different ways with respect to pathological features and putative pathogenic mechanisms. Apparently unrelated congenital anomalies occurred more frequently among probands with craniorachischisis (62%), encephalocele (30%), or multiple NTDs (25%) than among probands with anencephaly (14.7%) or spina bifida (10.1%) (P much less than .0001). Unrelated congenital anomalies occurred less often among probands with low spina bifida (6.7%) than among probands with high spina bifida (19.5%). NTDs were seen in 7.8% of the siblings of probands with high spina bifida but in only 0.7% of the siblings of probands with low spina bifida, in 2.2% of the siblings of anencephalic probands, and in none of the siblings of probands with craniorachischisis, encephalocele, or multiple NTDS (P less than .001). In all 16 families in which two siblings had NTDs, both had either defects of the type associated with abnormal primary neurulation or defects of the type associated with abnormal canalization. High spina bifida and multiple NTDs were found more frequently than expected among the Sikh probands (P less than .02). The frequency of non-NTD congenital anomalies was higher among siblings of Sikh probands (8.8%) than among siblings of other probands (2.4%) (P less than .05). This excess was due to the occurrence of hydrocephalus without spina bifida in four of 68 siblings of Sikh probands.\r"

  ".W": "Heterogeneity in the size of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles was used to identify two distinct patterns based on gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. These two phenotypes, LDL subclass pattern A and pattern B, were characterized by a predominance of large, buoyant LDL particles and small, dense LDL particles, respectively. The inheritance of these LDL subclass patterns was investigated in a sample of 61 healthy families including 301 individuals. LDL subclass pattern B was present in 31% of the subjects, with the prevalence varying by gender, age, and (in women) menopausal status. Complex segregation analysis suggested a major locus controlling LDL subclass patterns. The model providing the best fit to the data included a dominant mode of inheritance with a frequency of .25 for the allele determining LDL subclass pattern B and reduced penetrance for men under age 20 and for premenopausal women. Thus, the allele for the LDL subclass pattern characterized by a predominance of small, dense LDL particles appears to be very common in the population, although not usually expressed until adulthood in men and until after menopause in women. The presence of a major gene controlling LDL subclass could explain much of the familial aggregation of lipid and apolipoprotein levels and may be involved in increased risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

Several of the VNTR markers isolated in those experiments were sequenced, and a DNA sequence of 9 bp (GNNGTGGG) emerged as an apparent consensus sequence for VNTR markers. To confirm this result and to develop more VNTR markers, we synthesized nine different 18-base-long oligonucleotides whose sequences each included GNNGTGGG. When 102 cosmid clones selected by these oligonucleotides were tested for polymorphism, 34 (33%) of them showed multiallelic VNTR polymorphisms (average heterozygosity 68%). This procedure represents a new and efficient approach for isolating additional VNTR markers and supports the idea that the GNNGTGGG sequence may play an important role in the generation of the multiallelic systems within the human genome.\r"

For these sequences, allelic uncertainty arises from determining length of DNA fragments from mobility in gel electrophoresis.

  ".W": "The results of 1,465,423 allele product determinations based on blood samples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, involving 30 different proteins representing 32 different gene products, are analyzed in a variety of ways, with the following conclusions: (1) Sibships and their parents are included in the sample. Our analysis reveals that statistical procedures designed to reduce the sample to equivalent independent genomes do not in population comparisons compensate for the familial cluster effect of rare variants. Accordingly, the data set was reduced to one representative of each sibship (937,427 allele products). (2) Both chi 2-type contrasts and a genetic distance measure (delta) reveal that rare variants (P less than .01) are collectively as effective as polymorphisms in establishing genetic differences between the two cities. (3) We suggest that rare variants that individually exhibit significant intercity differences are probably the legacy of tribal private polymorphisms that occurred during prehistoric times. (4) Despite the great differences in the known histories of the two cities, both the overall frequency of rare variants and the number of different rare variants are essentially identical in the two cities. (5) The well-known differences in locus variability are confirmed, now after adjustment for sample size differences for the various locus products; in this large series we failed to detect variants at only three of 29 loci for which sample size exceeded 23,000. (6) The number of alleles identified per locus correlates positively with subunit molecular weight. (7) Loci supporting genetic polymorphisms are characterized by more rare variants than are loci at which polymorphisms were not encountered. (8) Loci whose products do not appear to be essential for health support more variants than do loci the absence of whose product is detrimental to health. (9) There is a striking excess of rare variants over the expectation under the neutral mutation/drift/equilibrium theory. We suggest that this finding is primarily due to the relatively recent (in genetic time) agglomeration of previously separated tribal populations; efforts to test for agreement with the expectations of this theory by using data from modern cosmopolitan populations are exercises in futility. (10) All of these findings should characterize DNA variants in exons as more data become available, since the finding are the protein expression of such variants.\r"

Type I collagen extracted from bone and types I and III collagen produced by dermal fibroblasts were normal, as was the hexosamine ratio of cartilage proteoglycans. Hyaline cartilage, however, contained approximately equal amounts of types I and II collagen and decreased amounts of type XI collagen. Unlike the normal SDS-PAGE mobility. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed extensive overmodification of all type II cyanogen bromide peptides in a pattern consistent with heterozygosity for an abnormal pro alpha 1(II) chain which impaired the assembly and/or folding of type II collagen. This interpretation implies that dominant mutations of the COL2A1 gene may cause type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis. More generally, emerging data implicating defects of type II collagen in the type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis-spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita spectrum and in the Kniest-Stickler syndrome spectrum suggest that diverse mutations of this gene may be associated with widely differing phenotypic outcome.\r"

Two-thirds of all mutant alleles were confined within only four haplotypes, while the last third was accounted for by 12 haplotypes, including eight haplotypes absent from Caucasian pedigrees reported thus far. Several mutant haplotypes were present in typical phenylketonuria only, others were present in variants only, and some were present in both. In addition, a particular mutant haplotype (haplotype 2) was found to harbor different mutations in our series, resulting in either typical phenylketonuria or in mild hyperphenylalaninemias. The diploid combination of so many mutant haplotypes in PAH-deficient patients and of compound heterozygosity at the PAH locus in southern Europe might account for the broad spectrum of individual phenotypes observed in France.\r"

Since human OAT cDNA hybridizes to DNA sequences on both human chromosomes 10 and X, a locus coding for OAT enzyme activity may be present on one or both of these human chromosomes. We have used a series of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, in combination with starch gel electrophoresis and a histochemical stain for OAT enzyme activity, to assign the structural gene for OAT to human chromosome 10. Our results suggest that the human X chromosome does not contain a locus coding for OAT enzyme activity. In addition, we have used a panel of Chinese hamster-mouse hybrids to assign the murine Oat structural gene to mouse chromosome 7. Our findings, combined with recent molecular studies, indicate that human OAT probes specific for chromosome 10 will be useful for the diagnosis and genetic counseling of individuals at risk for gyrate atrophy.\r"

Alkaline hydrolysis significantly reduced grain number for DYZ2 (58%-82%; P less than .05) but not for DYZ1 (P greater than .05). Similar results were observed for interphase nuclei.

Overall, the multidimensional scaling method was less powerful than either seriation or the product of recombination frequencies. The latter two methods were approximately equally powerful.

The -alpha/, alpha alpha alpha/, -zeta/, and zeta zeta zeta/rearrangements are each associated exclusively with a particular haplotype, providing evidence of a single evolutionary origin for each.

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND METHODS: Despite the increasing availability of medical ethics consultations, little research addresses the impact of these consultations on physicians. Therefore, we surveyed physician-requesters and reviewed medical charts to evaluate the 44 ethics consultations concerning individual patients at our university medical center over an 18-month period. RESULTS: The physicians who requested these consultations said 14 consultations identified previously unrecognized ethical issues, and 18 changed patient management considerably. The medical charts showed that the most frequently overlooked issue was inappropriate family decisions for incompetent adult patients (five consultations) and the most frequent management changes involved withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (12 consultations). CONCLUSIONS: Ethics consultations appeared to have considerable impact on physicians in conducting patient care.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Beginning in the 1980s, methotrexate has been used successfully to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The magnitude and severity of short- and long-term methotrexate toxicity, however, have not been adequately investigated. Our study was performed to determine the prevalence of hepatotoxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving long-term methotrexate therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, computer-assisted review of all Duke University Medical Center patients undergoing liver biopsy for methotrexate monitoring from January 1979 to January 1988. A total of 538 biopsies were performed in 399 patients, 259 of whom had inflammatory arthritis (210 with rheumatoid arthritis, 47 with psoriatic arthritis, and two with seronegative spondyloarthropathy). RESULTS: No evidence of cirrhosis was defined in the cohort with rheumatoid arthritis; however, six patients with rheumatoid arthritis had histologic changes of fibrotic liver disease (prevalence of 2.9 percent in the group with rheumatoid arthritis) while taking methotrexate. Five of the six patients were obese and three had glucose intolerance or overt diabetes mellitus, and one person admitted to alcohol usage. Only one patient with fibrotic liver disease had elevated liver function test results, and no person showed a declining serum albumin level at the time of biopsy. Sixty-one patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent multiple samplings (44 with two, 13 with three, and four with four biopsies). Fourteen of these patients showed progressive hepatic disease, whereas four patients improved. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of methotrexate hepatotoxicity in this large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was low, a small but definite risk of hepatic fibrosis, not predictable by laboratory screening, still exists.\r"

  ".U": "89060321\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE AND METHODS: A number of endocrine peptides and proteins are expressed by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The expression of two newly appreciated neuroendocrine tumor markers, chromogranin A (CgA) and the endocrine antigen defined by monoclonal antibody HISL-19, was determined in 14 MTCs by immunohistology to evaluate the clinical utility of these markers in the diagnosis of MTC. Papillary, follicular, and undifferentiated thyroid tumors were also evaluated along with an MTC cell line. The same tissues were evaluated with antibodies to human calcitonin. RESULTS: All human calcitonin antibodies were found to react with the MTCs. In addition, all MTCs were reactive for CgA and the antigen detected by antibody HISL-19. CgA was generally present in the human calcitonin-containing cells, whereas the HISL-19 antigen had a more distinctive distribution. The other thyroid tumors failed to show reactivity with any of the three antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that, in addition to human calcitonin, MTCs commonly express CgA and the antigen defined by antibody HISL-19. Our observations thus add to the repertoire of endocrine substances produced by MTC. These studies also demonstrate the clinical value of immunohistologic procedures for two novel antigens in distinguishing MTCs from other thyroid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The traditional treatment of acute pyelonephritis has been hospitalization and parenteral administration of antibiotics. No previous study, however, has attempted to differentiate between those patients with pyelonephritis who might be safely managed as outpatients and those in whom hospitalization is required. We therefore decided to determine whether women with pyelonephritis can be effectively and safely managed outside the hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 94 female outpatients and 100 hospitalized women treated for acute pyelonephritis at San Francisco General Hospital were reviewed. Utilizing baseline clinical and laboratory data, we compared outcome in the two groups, and computed the cost-benefit of managing pyelonephritis on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: We observed a similarity in the frequency of successful outcomes (approximately 90 percent in each group) and absence of serious adverse outcome in any outpatient. Results of urine culture were comparable in inpatients and outpatients, with Escherichia coli identified as the most common urinary pathogen in both groups. The frequency of resistance to ampicillin of E. coli and other urinary pathogens was nearly 30 percent. A cost analysis demonstrated a 7.5-fold difference between the inpatient and outpatient groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that treatment of pyelonephritis with oral antibiotics poses a safe and effective method of therapy in immunocompetent women without underlying illness. The use of ampicillin as a single agent for the treatment of pyelonephritis, however, is inadvisable. Our study also demonstrates the potential savings in managing selected patients with pyelonephritis as outpatients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND METHODS: The rickettsioses continue to constitute major health problems in many parts of the world. With increasing international travel, recognition of rickettsial diseases by physicians is becoming more important. The clinical features of four cases of rickettsial disease imported into Canada over a five-year period are presented; two patients with tick typhus (Rickettsia conorii), one patient with scrub typhus (R. tsutsugamushi), and one patient with murine typhus (R. typhi). We also present the North American data over the past 10 years from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (Atlanta). RESULTS: Since 1983 in the United States, three cases of imported scrub typhus, all after travel to India, were confirmed, as well as six cases of murine typhus after travel to southeast Asia. At the CDC, 67 imported cases of tick typhus have been confirmed by indirect fluorescent antibody test since 1976; most illnesses occurred after travel to Africa. CONCLUSION: Rickettsial diseases are underrecognized by physicians, who should consider these diagnoses in travelers returning from endemic areas. Since effective treatment is available, prompt diagnosis and treatment are important. In all cases, specific serologic confirmation should be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Pacemaker endless loop (or reentrant) tachycardia (ELT) is often terminated by conversion to the asynchronous mode of pacing by simply placing a magnet over the implanted atrial tracking (DDD or VDD) pacemaker. We investigated three other simple methods of ELT termination--chest wall stimulation (CWS), provocation of myopotential oversensing, and chest thumping--that may be useful when the arrhythmia is unresponsive to magnet application or a magnet is unavailable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A modified CWS technique using an external pulse generator (pulse width = 40 msec) ordinarily used for transcutaneous cardiac pacing was tested in 74 patients (40 with unipolar and 34 with bipolar DDD devices). CWS inhibited the ventricular channel of all DDD pacemakers easily and reliably. CWS was then applied during ELT in 20 patients (10 with unipolar and 10 with bipolar DDD devices). Provocation of myopotential oversensing by the ventricular channel was attempted during ELT in 10 patients with unipolar DDD pacemakers. Chest thumping was tried during ELT in six patients. RESULTS: CWS by the modified technique terminated ELT in all patients in whom the arrhythmia was induced. Myopotential oversensing resulted in successful ELT termination in six of the 10 patients. ELT was successfully terminated by chest thumping in four of six patients. CONCLUSION: These simple techniques provide effective ways of ELT termination other than magnet application, and may be easily applied by physicians unfamiliar with the complexities of contemporary DDD pacemakers and their programmers.\r"

  ".U": "89060328\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder consisting of the triad of oculocutaneous albinism, a storage pool platelet defect, and multisystem tissue deposition of ceroid pigment. Although the underlying metabolic defect has not been identified, secondary or associated effects on the immune system are suggested by reports of an association with disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, lupus, and frequent bacterial infections. We evaluated a large group of patients with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome to assess immune competence in this condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with this syndrome were studied. Control subjects included healthy volunteers in the same age range as the patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and neutrophils were isolated according to previously described methods. Immunofluorescent staining, flow cytometry, and cytotoxicity assays were performed. Determination of lymphocyte transformation, mixed lymphocyte response, and neutrophil function was made. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin levels, complement, lymphocyte subsets, natural killer and lymphokine-activated cytotoxicity, mixed lymphocyte responses, and lectin-induced transformation were normal in all patients. In addition, there was no evidence for a lymphocyte proliferative response to a preparation of urinary ceroid pigment isolated from these patients. Neutrophil function, including luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, chemotaxis, and aggregation was not significantly different from control values. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there is no generalized defect of peripheral blood lymphocyte or neutrophil function in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. We propose that future studies should examine the possibility that associated disorders arise from a defect within the monocyte-macrophage system, perhaps secondary to ceroid accumulation.\r"

DBM contains a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) that induces the differentiation of primitive mesenchymal cells into bone producing cells. The stromal cells of bone marrow can differentiate into osteoblasts after implantation, while collagen could serve as a calcification nucleus or framework for new tissue formation. Animals were killed 4 to 6 weeks after implantation. Implants were X-rayed, examined histologically, and analyzed for water content, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase. Only the implants of bone marrow enclosed in filter chambers (0.45 micron pore diameter) were associated with bone formation. Intramuscular implants of DBM and bone marrow in the old animals induced the formation of new bone but contained less calcium and lower levels of alkaline phosphatase than implants in the young animals. Collagen implants were resorbed and failed to induce bone formation or calcify. The results indicate that formation of new bone, under the conditions of this study, is reduced with aging.\r"

The indirect bilirubin decline correlates with a decrease in the dense sickle cells during crisis (r = .31, p less than .0009). During steady state, both indirect bilirubin and lactic acid dehydrogenase correlate significantly with number of dense red cells (r = .62, p less than .000002 and r = .32, p less than .02 respectively). Platelet counts, beta-thromboglobulin, Platelet Factor 4, and Fibrinopeptide A levels all were elevated during steady state and did not change during the evolution of crisis. These data demonstrate that elevated indices usually associated with platelet activation are a feature of the steady state of sickle cell disease but argue against thrombosis as a factor in the progression of a sickle cell painful crisis episode. The parallel decline of both dense cells and bilirubin during painful crises indicates that the disappearance of dense cells during crisis is not caused by hemolysis and supports the hypothesis that dense red cell sequestration, in the absence of evidence of thrombosis, is an intrinsic component of the evolution of sickle cell painful crisis.\r"

Previous nondiagnostic workups included 4 +/- 1 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of 24-hour Holter and/or in-hospital telemetric monitoring per patient. The duration of monitoring averaged 31 +/- 2 days per patient. Electrocardiographic recordings were made during a typical symptom episode in 9 of 31 (29%) patients, including 0 of 16 with syncope, 3 of 8 (37%) with presyncope, and 6 of 7 (86%) with palpitations (p less than .001). The probability of recording typical symptoms was strongly influenced by their previous frequency. Potentially causal arrhythmias were documented in 5 of 7 (71%) patients with palpitations, but in none of the other symptom subgroups (p less than .001). Monitoring led to changes in therapy in only two patients. During followup of 9 +/- 1 months, symptoms continued in 4 of 16 (25%) with syncope, 7 of 8 (87%) with presyncope, and 7 of 7 (100%) with palpitations (p = .001). The diagnostic utility of these devices thus appears to be low in patients with previously unexplained syncope or presyncope. The yield was high in those monitored for palpitations, which may be in part attributable to the greater frequency of symptoms observed in this group.\r"

The presence of oxytocin and vasopressin in human and rat pancreatic extracts suggests the possibility of local synthesis of both hormones. The neurohypophysial hormones are known to be endocrine mediators of insulin and glucagon release. The finding of oxytocin and vasopressin in the pancreas raises the possibility, although yet unproven, of local synthesis and perhaps a paracrine function for the neurohypophysial peptides upon pancreatic hormone release or for a local function upon the liver.\r"

We illustrated the clinical value of this technique in a 71-year-old woman with acute megakaryocytic leukemia, which was diagnosed by staining of the blasts with factor VIII antigen and their morphologic resemblance to megakaryoblasts. Marrow cells were removed from needle biopsies by vortexing in RPMI medium, centrifuged in Ficoll-Hypaque, stained with a propidium-iodide/NP-40 mixture, and analyzed at 488 nm using an argon laser. During 3 weeks of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-c) infusion therapy, hyperdiploid peak A dropped from 35% (day 0) to 2.3% (day 14) to 0% (day 21), with development of marrow hypoplasia. Similarly, hyperdiploid peak B, went from 7.6% to 9.1% to 3.5%. Subsequently, her marrow recovered normal morphology and lost the aneuploid peaks. Her blood counts recovered to near normal. Four months later, she relapsed and had a return of the day-21, incompletely eradicated peak B. There was no evidence of peak A. Repeated treatment with ara-c resulted in temporary suppression of the disease, but she died 3 months later with progressive hepatosplenomegaly. Analysis of cells from her enlarged liver, heavily infiltrated with blasts, showed a large hyperdiploid peak B. In this patient, ara-c therapy induced a remission with permanent eradication of one clone, but incomplete eradication of a second clone, which ultimately led to her relapse and death.\r"

Suffering is measured from the patient's viewpoint by multiple attribute measures and profiles, goal attainment scaling, and utility ratings, in which the patient's preferences for various health states are assessed. Having collected information on death, disability and suffering, the investigator faces decisions concerning setting their priorities when one measure (such as death) precludes the assessment of another or when there are disagreements among the measures.\r"

In two cases the diagnosis was confirmed histologically. The cases differed clinically and histopathologically from those in immunocompetent patients. There was no evidence that disease originated in preexisting retinochoroidal scars. Lesions frequently were bilateral and multifocal. Vitreous inflammatory reaction was a common clinical finding, but histopathologic examination demonstrated scant retinal inflammation in areas of necrosis. Ocular toxoplasmosis in these patients with AIDS probably resulted from newly acquired infection or dissemination of organisms from nonocular sites of disease. Infections became clinically inactive with drug therapy in all treated patients, but reactivation and progression of disease occurred when therapy was stopped in two of three patients. Severe retinal necrosis led to retinal tears or detachment in three cases. Ocular lesions were the first manifestation of Toxoplasma gondii infection in four of five patients with evidence of multisystem infection.\r"

All incisions showed disruption of Bowman's membrane, 15 of 16 showed malapposition of Bowman's membrane, and 14 of 16 showed epithelial plugging. In this case the healing and strength of radial keratotomy incisions were suboptimal seven years after the procedure.\r"

Predisposing factors included improper lens care by the refractive lens wearers and a chronic epithelial defect with topical corticosteroid use among the therapeutic lens wearers. The responsible organisms in the refractive lens group were Fusarium solani (two patients) and Cephalosporium and Paecilomyces (one patient each), and in the therapeutic lens group Candida (three patients) and Aspergillus (one patient). Filamentous fungi were more likely to be associated with cosmetic or aphakic lens wear, whereas yeasts were more frequently found with therapeutic lens use.\r"

Most of the patients tended to be of light complexion and eye coloring without a family history of basal cell carcinoma. A second group of patients with basal cell nevus syndrome was identified. The tumors generally were single small lesions, but not nodular, usually being morpheaform in tissue structure. The tumors were present for an average of 4.3 years before diagnosis.

Forty-three of 45 proven paragonimiasis serum specimens had antibodies to this diagnostic band. Of 29 normal serum specimens and 210 serum specimens from patients with other parasitic and nonparasitic infections, only 1 serum, from a schistosomiasis haematobium patient, reacted positively. These results indicate that our immunoblot for paragonimiasis, which uses a comparatively crude antigen, is highly sensitive (96%) and specific (99%).\r"

In the first study, 35 patients received single oral doses of ivermectin, 5-200 mcg/kg body weight. Blood microfilariae levels did not decrease after a single oral 5, 10, 30, or 50 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin, but levels did decrease after doses of 100, 150, and 200 mcg/kg. The most efficacious dose was 200 mcg/kg; mean blood microfilariae levels decreased to 12% of mean pretreatment values by day 15 and remained decreased for 28 days. A second study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ivermectin in patients with multifilarial infections. All 17 patients had concomitant Loa loa and O. volvulus infection. M. perstans affected 5 of the patients. Sixteen patients also had infections due to intestinal nematodes. The patients each received single oral doses of 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Ten days later, the mean Loa loa blood microfilariae level had decreased to 20% of the mean pretreatment level. O. volvulus dermal microfilariae densities were reduced to 2% of the pretreatment levels. A minimal increase in blood microfilaria levels was observed on day 28. In contrast, dermal microfilariae levels remained near zero for the duration of the study. Intestinal infection due to Ascaris was eradicated in all of the affected patients by day 23; efficacy against Trichuris and hookworm infections, however, was poor. All patients tolerated ivermectin well including those with multiple infections.\r"

Based on analysis of restriction endonuclease digests, all Ogawa isolates had an identical resistance plasmid. This plasmid differed from plasmids in resistant V. cholerae O1 strains isolated in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. On Southern blot analysis of restriction endonuclease digests of chromosomal DNA using DNA probes there were no apparent differences between Kenyan V. cholerae O1 strains isolated before and after emergence of antibiotic resistance; however, a majority of El Tor strains isolated in other geographic areas had the same Southern blot pattern. Our data document the apparent endemicity of multiply antimicrobial resistant V. cholerae O1 strains in Kenya, and the persistence of a single unique resistance plasmid among isolates of serotype Ogawa.\r"

Eight such patients were treated on nine separate occasions with increasing subcutaneous doses of a synthetic somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) 4 days prior to surgery or hepatic arterial embolization. The patients were tested by pentagastrin provocation and simultaneous measurement of serotonin (5-HT) levels in peripheral blood before and after prophylactic treatment, to evaluate the efficacy of SMS 201-995. The provoked release of 5-HT was markedly diminished, and the basal levels of 5-HT were markedly reduced in patients with high initial levels. During surgery or embolization both SMS 201-995, as well as ketanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor blocker, were given. With this combined treatment all patients were hemodynamically stable during surgery or embolization. During embolization the arterial levels of 5-HT increased only moderately, while urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid remained unchanged despite a proven adequate embolization. Two patients were operated on without previous treatment with SMS 201-995; both developed severe crises at induction of anesthesia, but IV SMS 201-995 rapidly reversed the bronchoconstriction and facial flush and gradually restored arterial blood pressure, even though cardiac output remained depressed for a prolonged period. The crisis reaction correlated well with high circulating levels of 5-HT, but after treatment with SMS 201-995 these levels were still high.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In obese patients given vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), the time to go from 5 to 25% of recovery of twitch response was statistically significantly longer (14.6 +/- 7 minutes, mean +/- SD) than it was in nonobese control patients (6.9 +/- 2 minutes). Similarly, with vecuronium times for recovery from 25 to 75% were longer (33 +/- 15 minutes) in obese patients than in control patients (13.2 +/- 2 minutes), as was time to 75% recovery, 82 +/- 30 minutes in obese patients, 50 +/- 9 minutes in controls. In contrast, obese patients given atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) exhibited no difference in recovery indexes or recovery times when compared to control patients of normal weight. The prolonged duration of action of vecuronium in obese patients is most likely related to impaired hepatic clearance and/or an overdose effect with recovery occurring during the distribution phase. That the duration of action of atracurium is not prolonged in the obese is believed due to this relaxant's not depending on organ function for elimination.\r"

Lidocaine HCl, 4-5 mg/kg, was administered by IV injection over 60 seconds. Serial samples of arterial blood and urine were collected over 4 hours, and drug concentrations were determined using a gas chromatographic technique. The volume of the central compartment was greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant ewes (1.51 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.96 +/- 0.16 L/kg) as was the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss): 3.24 +/- 0.40 vs. 1.88 +/- 0.32 L/kg. The volume of distribution during the terminal exponential phase of drug elimination (Vd beta) and total clearance of lidocaine (Cl) were also higher in pregnant animals: 4.17 +/- 0.50 L/kg and 99.6 +/- 8.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, respectively; compared to 2.46 +/- 0.48 L/kg and 44.1 +/- 6.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, in nonpregnant ewes. However, the balance between these changes in Vd beta and Cl did not result in a significant difference in the elimination half-life of lidocaine (38.1 +/- 2.1 minutes in nonpregnant and 31.9 +/- 3.0 minutes in pregnant ewes). If these data are applicable to humans, the risk of drug accumulation after repeated administration of lidocaine is no greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant patients.\r"

  ".W": "A solution of ethyl alcohol, polyethylglycol, and distilled water that did (n = 5) or did not (n = 5) contain 250 micrograms/kg of the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was infused into the right atrium in 10 healthy mongrel dogs. Hydrochloric acid (pH = 1.8), 2 ml/kg, was then instilled into both lungs of all dogs via the tracheal tube. Hemodynamic data were collected before and 10 minutes after nifedipine was infused and 10, 45, 90 and 180 minutes after acid was instilled into the lungs. Gas exchange, including PaO2 and venous admixture, did not differ between the two groups. However, after aspiration, oxygen delivery significantly improved in the dogs given nifedipine compared to oxygen delivery in those not treated with nifedipine. We conclude that, despite significant decreases in PaO2 and venous admixture, nifedipine can restore oxygen delivery back to normal levels.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intraperitoneal (IP) and lumbar intrathecal (IT) midazolam (MID) on nociception was studied in 38 male albino rats using the noxious tale-flick and hot-plate tests. Four groups received IP 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg MID or an equal volume of its vehicle benzyl alcohol 0.1 mg in 1 ml saline, while the other three groups received IT 10 and 100 micrograms MID or 0.5 microgram benzyl alcohol in 5 microliter saline. The two higher doses of IP MID produced statistically significant decrease of tale-flick latencies (P less than 0.005 and 0.05 at 10 and 100 mg/kg MID, respectively). This hyperalgesic effect could be seen, although the animals appeared highly sedated with reduced motor activity and relatively unresponsive to non-noxious stimuli. In contrast, IT injections of 10 micrograms MID produced moderate but statistically significant prolongation of tail-flick latencies (P less than 0.05) without noticeable change in motor activity. This analgesic effect could not be observed with the higher dose of IT MID until an hour after its administration. The almost complete immobility and ataxia seen after the high doses of IP and IT MID (animals lying on their sides) precluded reliable hot plate testing in these animals. Apparently part of the high IT dose of MID diffused into the brain, as observed after high-dose IP administration. We therefore propose that the analgesic effect of midazolam stems from its action at the spinal level, while its sedative and hyperalgesic effects are a function of its supraspinal action.\r"

Clamps were sequentially applied to the dew claw and/or tail of each animal to determine the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that suppressed movement in response to each of these stimuli. MAC obtained by clamping the tail (8.28 +/- 1.34% [mean +/- standard deviation] for I-653 and 1.65 +/- 0.36% for isoflurane) was more variable and lower than MAC obtained by clamping the dew claw (10.00 +/- 0.94% for I-653 and 2.04 +/- 0.19% for isoflurane). We conclude that the type of stimulus applied affects the MAC value obtained for I-653 and isoflurane. Clamping the tail is not a supramaximal stimulus in pigs; a greater stimulus is provided by clamping the dew claw.\r"

The present study suggests a possible hypersensitivity basis for enflurane hepatitis and the apparent cross-sensitization between halothane and enflurane involving covalently bound liver microsomal adducts. Immunoblotting studies have revealed that antibodies in the sera of six patients with halothane hepatitis recognize liver microsomal antigens of Mr = 100,000, or both 100,000 and 76,000, formed in rats treated with enflurane or halothane. These antigens were not detected in microsomes from isoflurane- or sesame oil-treated rats. The recognition of these antigens could be abolished by preincubation of the sera with microsomes from halothane-treated rats. These data suggest that the difluoromethoxydifluoroacetyl halide metabolite of enflurane, as well as the trifluoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane, covalently bind to similar hepatic proteins, and may become immunogens in susceptible patients. This mechanism may also account for the apparent cross-sensitization between halothane and enflurane anesthesia, and the development of hepatic necrosis.\r"

Twelve patients, who required major blood replacement during elective surgery, were studied to determine the changes in coagulation when packed red cells were used to replace major blood loss. In addition, the coagulation abnormalities present at the time an observer noted excessive bleeding were determined. Prior to blood product replacement and after the estimated loss of each 0.3 blood volume, coagulation tests were obtained including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen levels, and assays of coagulation Factors V, VIII, and IX. Coagulation tests were repeated when clinical hemostasis was judged inadequate by the anesthesiologist and attending surgeon. Significant decreases in platelet count, fibrinogen levels, and Factor V, VIII, and IX levels occurred as increasing blood volumes were replaced. Increases in PT and aPTT above control occurred in nine of the 12 patients prior to replacement of 1 blood volume; none of the nine patients had increased clinical bleeding. In four of seven patients who had blood replacement of greater than 1 blood volume, increased clinical bleeding was noted by the observer. Platelet counts were less than 100,000/mm3 in each of these four patients, and a platelet concentrate obtained by pheresis of a single donor was administered. In two of the four patients platelet counts increased, but clinical bleeding did not resolve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89060572\r", 
  ".W": "Whether anesthetic technique affected the incidence of myocardial ischemia in 60 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy was investigated. The patients were randomly assigned to receive halothane or isoflurane (with nitrous oxide) either at a low concentration alone or at a higher concentration with phenylephrine added to support blood pressure. Blood pressure was maintained within 20% of each patient's average ward systolic pressure. Seven leads of electrocardiograms (ECG) and echocardiograms were analyzed for segmental wall motion. The echocardiograms were analyzed using standard formulae for end-systolic meridional wall stress (SWS) and rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening (Vcfc). Because of the nature of these calculations, only echocardiograms with normal regional wall motion could be accurately analyzed. The patients had postoperative ECG and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) isoenzyme determinations and regularly scheduled clinical examinations to detect perioperative myocardial infarction and neurologic deficits. Although blood pressures were similar, the patients who received a higher concentration of anesthetic plus phenylephrine had a higher wall stress, regardless of the choice of anesthetic agent. All four techniques allowed provision of the same stump pressures (the marker surgeons used for adequacy of collateral carotid flow). No difference could be found in wall stress or incidence of myocardial ischemia between isoflurane and halothane. The patients who received phenylephrine had a threefold greater incidence of myocardial ischemia than did the patients who had light anesthesia to maintain similar systolic blood pressures and stump pressures. The groups were demographically and hemodynamically similar; in particular, the heart rates were not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

FRC was measured by helium dilution, and intrapulmonary shunt was distinguished from ventilation-perfusion inequality by multiple tracer inert gas elimination analysis. Awake supine FRC was 34.6 +/- 6.6% (mean +/- SD) of total lung capacity (TLC), and closing capacity (CC) was 29.8 +/- 5.3% of TLC. Anesthesia, muscle paralysis, tracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation produced an average 14.6 +/- 13.3% FRC reduction to an average anesthesia FRC 29.8% of TLC (P = 0.002). Shunt increased from 1.2% +/- 1.5% awake to 8.6 +/- 8.3% during anesthesia (P = 0.005). A nonlinear relationship was found between shunt and FRC/TLC so that anesthetized subjects with an FRC less than awake CC had an average 11.4 +/- 8.3% shunt, whereas subjects with an FRC greater than CC had a 2.4 +/- 2.8% shunt (P = 0.025). Nonsmokers developed shunt only if FRC was less than CC. Smokers showed a significantly higher shunt for a given (FRC-CC)/TLC compared to nonsmokers (P less than 0.001). The slope of the regression of shunt on BMI (body mass index = weight/height2) showed a significant increase during anesthesia (P = 0.005), and smokers had a significantly higher slope compared to nonsmokers (P = 0.001). These findings suggest a gravity-dependent mechanism for intrapulmonary shunting during anesthesia. Therefore, shunting was due to dependent regional lung volume reduction associated with an FRC decrease to less than closing capacity. The enhanced intrapulmonary shunting in smokers may have been related to the increased dependent regional residual volume associated with smoking.\r"

After 20 min SNP was discontinued and a second control period of 20 min followed (step 3). Thereafter, SNP was repeated for 20 min as in step 2, but MAP was maintained by inflating a balloon in the descending aorta (step 4). SNP was again discontinued followed by a final 20 min control period (step 5). During SNP with hypotension (step 2) there was a significant 21% decrease in CBF and no change in ICP. During SNP with normotension (step 4) both CBF and ICP increased (16 and 39%, respectively). In group 2 dogs isoflurane was discontinued and a spinal anesthetic was administered. Thereafter, these dogs were studied as in group 1. The only significant change in these dogs was a 35% increase in ICP during SNP with normotension. Group 3 dogs were studied identically to group 2, but hypotension was induced with trimethaphan (TMP). There were no significant changes in these dogs. The authors conclude that SNP, in the absence of isoflurane, dilates capacitance vessels because ICP increased without a concomitant increase in CBF at normotension. In the presence of isoflurane, SNP dilates both capacitance and resistance vessels because ICP and CBF increased concomitantly at normotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Volatile anesthetics have been shown to decrease hormone-induced adenosine cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation and to increase guanosine cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) content in mouse ventricular myocardium. Hormone-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP, and the cGMP response to alpha adrenergic agonists are mediated by a guanine nucleotide binding protein (N) sensitive to pertussis toxin. To evaluate the involvement of N proteins in the action of halothane on cyclic nucleotides in the heart, mice were pretreated with pertussis toxin, 50 micrograms/kg, ip, 72 h prior to exposure to halothane, 1.2 vol%. Pretreatment with the toxin decreased the cGMP response to halothane by 65% but was without effect on the decrease in myocardial cAMP induced by the anesthetic. The results indicate that a functionally active pertussis toxin-sensitive N protein is involved in the cGMP response to halothane, but not in the cAMP response.\r"

Peritonitis was quantified by extraction of Evans blue-bound albumin from the tissue exposed to HCl and analyzed by a spectrophotometric technique. In the first set of experiments, one group of rats had the peritoneal surface exposed to HCl following local pretreatment with isotonic saline; a second group of rats had the peritoneum exposed to HCl after topical pretreatment with an equal volume of lidocaine 1%, whereas in a third group the peritoneal surface was exposed only to saline without HCl. The experimental design in the second set of experiments was similar to that of the first set except that bupivacaine 0.5% was used instead of lidocaine in the second group. Results show a significant inhibition of peritonitis in the groups pretreated with lidocaine (P less than 0.01) and bupivacaine (P less than 0.05) compared with rats in the saline pretreated group. In the lidocaine-pretreated group Evans blue-albumin extravasation did not differ significantly from the rats not receiving HCl, whereas the bupivacaine-pretreated group showed a slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) more pronounced peritonitis than control rats not exposed to HCl. In the third set of experiments the peritoneum was topically treated with either lidocaine 1%, bupivacaine 0.5%, or isotonic saline after first having exposed the peritoneal surface to HCl. A significant inhibition of albumin extravasation was seen following lidocaine (P less than 0.001) or bupivacaine (P less than 0.001) treatment compared with treatment with isotonic saline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For this purpose, the effects of various anesthetic doses of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on myocardial calcium sensitivity and maximal calcium-activated force were examined in rat cardiac fibers skinned with Triton X-100. In this preparation, all membranes are chemically destroyed, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not functional. The three anesthetics shifted the pCa/tension curves (pCa = -log10[Ca2+]) toward higher calcium concentrations and decreased pCa for half-maximum activation (pCa50) in a dose-dependent and reversible fashion without changing the slope of this relationship (Hill coefficient). No differences between agents were observed at equipotent anesthetic concentrations. In addition, the three anesthetics decreased both maximal activated tension and tension at half-maximal activation in a dose-dependent fashion. Both the decrease in calcium sensitivity and the decrease in maximum activated tension may contribute to the negative inotropic effects of these agents. The relative importance of such effects compared with the other mechanisms of action remains to be determined, however.\r"

Burst suppression was produced for 15 min before MCAo and maintained throughout the ischemic period by 2.18 +/- 0.11% (mean +/- SE) end-expired isoflurane or 135 +/- 18 mg.kg-1 thiopental. Mean arterial pressure was supported with phenylephrine and maintained at approximately 90 mmHg in both groups throughout the ischemic period. At the end of the ischemic period, the isoflurane or thiopental was discontinued, allowing the animals to awaken. Intensive care was provided as needed. Neurologic function was scored for 8 days at the end of which surviving animals were killed and the brains were fixed in formalin and then examined for infarct size. There was no significant difference in final neurologic outcome between the animals receiving isoflurane and those receiving thiopental as determined by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Neurologic deficit scores ranged from normal (one of eight in the group receiving isoflurane and three of nine in the group receiving thiopental) to death resulting from brain injury (three in the isoflurane group and five in the thiopental-treated group). There also was no significant difference in infarct size between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors examined the direct in vitro effects of verapamil and the volatile anesthetics, halothane (HAL), enflurane (ENF), and isoflurane (ISO), in the isolated guinea pig heart. Each heart (N = 36) was perfused at constant pressure with an oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 36 degrees C. Recording electrodes were placed in the right atrium, septum, and right ventricular wall. Left ventricular pressure (LVP) and coronary flow were measured. The combination of 75 or 150 ng/ml verapamil and 0.7 or 1.4 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of each of the three anesthetics dose-dependently depressed spontaneous atrial rate (HR) and peak LVP, and prolonged atrial-septal (AV) time and intraventricular conduction time (IVCT). ENF decreased HR and LVP and increased IVCT more than did HAL or ISO at each anesthetic level. The combination of either level of ENF and 150 ng/ml verapamil reduced HR more than did the same level of verapamil with HAL or ISO; 1.4 MAC ENF with 150 ng/ml verapamil also caused sinus arrest in 17% of hearts. Although ENF, HAL, and ISO alone similarly depressed AV time, 1.4 MAC ENF synergistically increased, and 1.4 HAL and ISO additively increased, the delay in AV time due to each level of verapamil. In addition, 1.4 MAC ENF caused significant 25% and 67% incidences of complete AV block with low and high verapamil levels, respectively. Both levels of ENF with verapamil also increased IVCT more than did HAL or ISO with verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to measure the systemic elaboration of 2 bronchoconstrictive inflammatory mediators during naturally acquired acute asthma utilizing a prospective, serial-sampling protocol. Plasma levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2 alpha and histamine were measured by radioimmunoassay and radioenzymatic assay, respectively, in 23 children with acute asthma. Mean PG metabolite and histamine values (pg/ml) before (167 +/- 72, 1,029 +/- 378) and 10 to 90 min after (377 +/- 145, 1,000 +/- 489) initial therapy were significantly higher than those of the same children after resolution of asthma (2.9 +/- 0.2, 260 +/- 42) and those of normal children (4.3 +/- 0.9, 240 +/- 14). Peak PG metabolite levels were significantly higher in children who presented with PEFR values (% predicted) less than 40% (1,234 +/- 432) compared with those who presented with greater than 40% (404 +/- 296), and in children with post-therapy improvement in PEFR of less than 20% (1,281 +/- 470) compared with those with greater than 20% (365 +/- 226). Histamine levels were significantly higher in children with post-therapy improvement in PEFR of less than 20% (2,560 +/- 1,600) compared with those with greater than 20% (475 +/- 100), and in hospitalized (3,915 +/- 1,910) compared with nonhospitalized (408 +/- 130) children. Significant differences were not observed on the basis of corticosteroid dependence, allergic disposition, or type of initial therapy. These data suggest a role for histamine and PGF2 alpha in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation in acute asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The inhalation of platelet activating factor (PAF) produces bronchoconstriction in normal and asthmatic subjects. To identify the mechanism by which PAF-induced bronchoconstriction occurs in humans, bronchoprovocation testing was performed in 7 subjects (3 normal, 4 with mild asthma) after pretreatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), atropine, chlorpheniramine, or indomethacin. We determined the nebulizer concentration of PAF which reduced specific airway conductance (SGaw) 35% (PC35 SGaw) and the slope of the PAF dose-response curve. Atropine produced baseline bronchodilatation (SGaw increased 50%), while chlorpheniramine and indomethacin had no effect on baseline pulmonary function. Atropine increased airway responsiveness to PAF: the PC35 SGaw decreased 40% (p less than 0.05) and the slope of the PAF dose-response curve increased 86% (p less than 0.05). In contrast, chlorpheniramine inhibited the airway response to PAF: the PC35 SGaw increased 87% (p less than 0.05), while the slope of the PAF dose-response curve decreased an insignificant 37%. Indomethacin did not affect either measurement. Chlorpheniramine also prevented the PAF-induced facial flushing and feeling of warmth; atropine and indomethacin did not. These results suggest that PAF-induced bronchoconstriction in humans is mediated at least in part by histamine release, not by cholinergic or cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanisms. Other indirect effects, such as the release of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, or a direct effect on airway smooth muscle may also contribute to PAF-induced bronchoconstriction. Why atropine heightened the airway response to PAF is unclear.\r"

Wheezing, tightness in the chest, dyspnea, and cough were reported by 35, 23, 41, and 30 subjects, respectively. FEV1 values less than 80% pred were found in only 2 subjects.

Two subjects who had a PC20 less than or equal to 2 mg/ml demonstrated a less than 20% change in FEV1 after inhaling cold air.

The mean decreases in FEV1 elicited by HSDR, HSC, and exercise were 26, 27, and 25%, respectively, and were not significantly different. There was an approximate 300% maximal increase in NCA detected after both HSC and exercise challenges. Gel filtration chromatography on columns of Ultragel ACA 34 indicated that the NCA released after HSC provocation and exercise were 600 to 700 kDa. There was an approximate 100% maximal increase in NCA after HSDR challenge, and this was significantly less (p = 0.016) than that after HSC and exercise. Exercise but not hypertonic challenge was associated with a basophilia and a significant increase in plasma histamine. There was a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations after exercise but not after HSC challenge in 7 asthmatics. Epinephrine concentrations did not change after exercise or HSC inhalation. NCA was measured in 5 subjects subjected to 2 HSC challenges that were separated by 60 min. There was an increase in NCA detected after both provocations. The increase after the second challenge was significantly greater (p = 0.27 x 10(-4)) than that observed after the initial provocation, despite a substantially reduced bronchoconstrictor response after the second challenge.\r"

In this study, we investigated the effects of nipradilol, a new beta-blocker, which has NO2 residue in the molecular structure, and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) on guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle in comparison with the effect of propranolol. Nipradilol and ISDN showed dose-dependent relaxant effects on leukotriene (LT) D4-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle, though propranolol had no effect. 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP also showed a relaxant effect dose dependently. Nipradilol and ISDN elevated cyclic GMP levels in tracheal tissue dose dependently; however, propranolol caused no change in cyclic GMP levels. From these results, it is suggested that nipradilol relaxes LTD4-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle by increasing the tissue level of cyclic GMP.\r"

Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was measured by a pair of balloons, and diaphragmatic contractility was assessed from changes in tetanic contraction, produced by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves. Diaphragmatic fatigue was developed by applying an inspiratory resistive load to a spontaneously breathing dog for approximately 30 min. Fenoterol improved the Pdi of the fatigued canine diaphragm at all stimulation frequencies, and the increases in Pdi at low frequencies were greater. The potentiation of Pdi by fenoterol occurred in a dose-dependent manner with doses of 2.5 to 10 micrograms/kg and was equal to that of aminophylline. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not have significant effect on the Pdi at all stimulation frequencies. The augmentation of Pdi in the fatigued diaphragm by fenoterol was abolished by administration of a calcium antagonist, verapamil, and fenoterol did not change the diaphragmatic contractility in nonfatigued dogs. We thus have concluded that fenoterol improves contractility in the fatigued canine diaphragm and the effect might be brought about by an increased influx of calcium to the muscle cell.\r"

On admission, all patients received the standard therapeutic regimen for our hospital. Spirometry and essentially noninvasive multiple inert gas elimination measurements were obtained serially, approximately once every day, whereas conventional arterial blood gases were determined every 3 days. On admission, all patients showed severe air-flow obstruction (FEV1/FVC% = 34.1 +/- 4.3%) and moderate to severe hypoxemia without CO2 retention (PaO2 = 50.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg; PaCO2 = 37.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; AaPO2 = 53.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg). Nine of the 10 patients showed bimodal blood flow distributions (dispersion of blood flow distribution, log SD Q = 1.34 +/- 0.11; normal range, 0.3 to 0.6) with only small amounts of shunt (1.09 +/- 0.8%). However, no significant interindividual correlations were observed between maximal expiratory flow rates (FEV1 and FEF25(-75) and log SD Q (r2 = 0.14 and 0.006, respectively). This lack of correlation persisted throughout hospitalization. Despite both clinical and spirometric improvement in all patients, there was simultaneous improvement in VA/Q matching in only one patient. Statistically significant negative correlations between maximal expiratory flow rates and gas exchange did develop toward the end of the study (Weeks 3 and 4 after discharge) when maximal recovery of physiologic changes associated with the acute asthma attack was achieved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of almitrine on pulmonary gas exchange and circulation were assessed in 9 patients with ARDS who were sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated at constant FlO2 (range, 0.48 to 0.74). Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, conventional gas exchange, and the VA/Q distribution by the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGT) were measured before (baseline), during (ALM 15), at the end of (ALM 30), and at 30-min intervals after (POSTALM 30, 60, and 90) the intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg body weight of almitrine over 30 min. Almitrine significantly increased PaO2 from 78 +/- 15 mm Hg to 140 +/- 49 at ALM 15 and 138 +/- 52 at ALM 30. AaPO2 and QS/QT decreased during the administration of the drug. The MIGT showed that almitrine redistributed pulmonary blood flow from shunt areas (reduction from 29 +/- 11 to 17 +/- 11% of QT) to lung units with normal VA/Q ratios (increase from 63 +/- 9 to 73 +/- 6% of QT). The Ppa increased from 26 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 5 mm Hg without changes in QT. Changes were transient, returning toward baseline 30 min after stopping the infusion of the drug. Almitrine significantly reduced the VA/Q inequalities present in ARDS and may be useful in the management of those patients.\r"

The severity of the centrilobular emphysematous (CLE) lesions was determined in resected lung specimens, and the mean linear intercept (Lm) was measured on random histologic sections taken from regions without obvious emphysema. The exponential constant K was determined by fitting lung pressure-volume data obtained from the patient just prior to resection to the equation V = A - Be-KP. This allowed us to compare patients with little or no emphysema that had either normal (0.16 +/- 0.03 SD; n = 12) or increased (0.27 +/- 0.04 SD; n = 12) K to other patients that had severe emphysema but either normal (0.17 +/- 0.01 SD; n = 10) or increased (0.25 +/- 0.03 SD; n = 10) K. In subjects without emphysema, K was significantly related to Lm, suggesting that K is a measure of mean alveolar size. In the subjects with emphysema, a lower value for K was associated with more severe airway dysfunction and gas trapping. We conclude that K reflects airspace size except when airway closure subtracts the contribution of lung units from the deflation pressure-volume curve.\r"

The subjects were 157 men who met objective criteria for exercise being limited by respiratory impairment. VO2max (mean value, 1.38 L min-1) was described by FEV1 and single-breath lung transfer factor (diffusing capacity) for carbon monoxide (TL') singly or in combination, but the accuracy was poor (at best, standard error of the estimate, 0.36 L min-1; r2, 29.1%). FEV1 could be replaced by FVC and FEV1/FVC. Description of VO2max was improved by also including in the equation the variables age, fat-free mass, and submaximal exercise ventilation (VE). Transfer factor did not then contribute significantly. VO2max as percent of predicted (mean value of 60%) was described by %FVC or %FEV1, but the accuracy was poor (SEE, 16.0%; r2, 14%). Prediction was improved somewhat by the alternative use of inspiratory vital capacity and FEV1/FVC. Transfer factor did not contribute additional information; however, inclusion of VE materially improved the accuracy (SEE, 12.9%; r2, 44%). Among a subgroup of 35 men whose lung disease was due to asbestos, %TL' or transfer factor measured using a multibreath estimate of residual volume (%TLCO) made a small contribution to the explained variance, e.g.: %VO2max = 0.44% FEV1 -0.78 VE + 0.16% TLCO + 52.3 SEE 7.27%. This equation also described the %VO2max of all subjects (SEE, 13%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Testing was performed 3 to 4 h after placebo or 50 mg of indomethacin. Perception of dyspnea was measured using the modified Borg scale. Minute ventilation, workload, and Borg scale measurements at exhaustion and during moderate exercise were determined. The data demonstrated no statistically significant differences between values obtained for minute ventilation, workload, or Borg scale measurements on placebo and indomethacin study days. Contrary to the previous findings in normal subjects, indomethacin failed to significantly alter perceived dyspnea during exercise in patients with chronic airflow limitation. This suggests that prostanoids do not play a major role in the perception of dyspnea in these patients during exercise.\r"

During anesthesia and controlled ventilation, acute alveolar hypoxia was induced (10 to 13% inspired O2) and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic and blood rheologic measurements were compared with normoxia. In control dogs, cardiac index did not change during hypoxia, but pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) increased 79%, erythrocyte filterability decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), and relative viscosity of blood corrected for hematocrit did not change. In the pentoxifylline-treated dogs, cardiac index increased 28% and PVRI increased only 20%; in contrast to the control dogs, relative viscosity of blood was decreased by 18% and no significant changes in filterability were observed. The increase in PVRI in relation to the drop in arterial O2 saturation was significantly larger (p less than 0.05) in the control dogs. Pentoxifylline also increased P50 by 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In Series B, hemodynamic measurements were made during variations in blood flow (induced by restricting venous return) in 3 treated (26 mg/kg/day for 3 wk) and 3 control dogs.

  ".W": "We studied the alterations induced by acute experimental extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) on bronchoalveolar cell population in smoking and nonsmoking guinea pigs. Sixty-two animals divided into 3 groups were studied: Group 1 (17 animals), controls; Group 2 (21 animals), extrinsic alveolitis; Group 3 (24 animals), cigarette smoking and alveolitis. Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed on Days 1, 19, and 44 for all animals. Group 3 animals had a fourth lavage before starting cigarette smoking, that is, 28 days before the beginning of the antigen injections. The other lavages were as for the other groups. BAL results on Day 1 were similar for each group. Cigarette smoking per se did not modify BAL in Group 3. EAA induction resulted in a large increase in all BAL cells, especially neutrophils of recovered fluid, which increased from 38 x 10(3) to 1,474 x 10(3) ml-1 (p less than 0.01) in Group 2 and from 58 x 10(3) to 740 x 10(3) in Group 3 (p less than 0.01). After maintenance, BAL neutrophils.ml-1 decreased to 444 x 10(3) in Group 2 (p less than 0.01), but stayed the same in Group 3: 973 x 10(3). After EAA induction, BAL neutrophils.ml-1 were higher in Group 2 than in Group 3 (p = 0.039); however, Group 2 had less neutrophils.ml-1 than Group 3 (p = 0.035) after EAA maintenance. We conclude that EAA results in a neutrophilic alveolitis and which can be evaluated by sequential BAL, and that cigarette smoking decreases the initial neutrophilic response and retards the eventual recovery during maintenance injections.\r"

Of these, 1,030 answered questions on breathlessness and 994 performed acceptable spirometry. Using 2 levels of dyspnea, white collar workers had significantly fewer symptoms of breathlessness than both cement workers and other blue collar workers, and this effect was present even after controlling for FEV1 as well as other spirometric measurements. We found an effect of age on dyspnea but not of smoking category. Furthermore, questions on breathlessness showed a dependence on extreme overweight. In a 10-yr follow-up, 219 men had died. Dyspnea Grade 3 or worse according to Fletcher's breathlessness score was a good predictor of overall mortality, yielding a mortality ratio of 1.57 for given occupation, smoking category, years with central heating, and overweight status, after controlling for FEV1. We conclude that in a standardized setting, questions on breathlessness provide a sensitive and objective tool. They contain information additional to that provided by FEV1 and other spirometric measurements.\r"

The study population was stratified according to smoking habits and alcohol consumption. A total of 8,765 persons did not significantly change alcohol or smoking habits during the 5 yr of observation and constituted the study sample. The study sample included 32 women and 301 men with an alcohol consumption of greater than or equal to 350 g/wk (78 were nonsmokers). Multiple regression analysis showed that alcohol consumption significantly accelerated the loss of FEV1 and the loss of FVC with time. Consumption of 350 g of alcohol/wk had an effect on FEV1 comparable to the effect of smoking 15 g of tobacco/day.\r"

These cells have been observed in vitro to move chemotactically in response to many types of attractants that may be present on the lung's surface during a bacterial or particulate challenge. This study investigated the hypothesis that chemotactic ability is an important part of the defensive action of these cells as they ingest bacteria on the lung surface. We compared our mathematical model for lung clearance to previously published bacterial clearance data and determined the amount of alveolar macrophage chemotactic ability required to account for observed clearance rates. The results showed that random motion is insufficient for clearance, and a moderate amount of chemotactic ability is necessary for our predicted clearance rates to agree with experimentally measured clearance rates.\r"

  ".U": "89060667\r", 
  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody has been made to a peptide that is released by human alveolar macrophages. This enzyme-releasing peptide (ERP) causes neutrophils to secrete azurophilic granule enzymes. Normal subjects, patients with pulmonary fibrosis, and patients with sarcoidosis had similar concentrations of this peptide in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. However, patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had about 2.7 times higher concentrations in their lavage fluids. The enzyme-releasing activity in the lavage fluids was significantly correlated with 2 indices of the severity of the clinical illness in patients with ARDS, the APACHE score, and the chest radiograph score. The correlation was diminished or ablated by removing the peptide with the monoclonal antibody bound to staphylococcal Sepharose 4B. This peptide accounted for 62.08% (SD = 15.88%) of the enzyme-releasing activity in fluids from lungs of patients with ARDS and 86.39% (SD = 24.46%) of the activity in fluids from lungs of normal control subjects. Therefore, ERP is the major neutrophil enzyme-releasing agent in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS and from normal persons. There was a significant correlation between the neutrophil enzyme-releasing activity and the ERP concentrations in BAL of patients with ARDS. These observations suggest that modulation of neutrophil function by ERP significantly controls the protease and peroxidase loads in the lungs of patients with ARDS.\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of aluminum lactate inhalation to reduce the biologic activity of experimental silicosis in the sheep tracheal lobe model. Four groups of 10 sheep were exposed once to either 100 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by aerosol inhalation of 10 ml PBS at monthly intervals (PBS-PBS group), to 100 ml PBS followed by inhalation of 100 mg aluminum lactate in 10 ml PBS (PBS-Al group), to 100 mg of quartz in 100 ml PBS followed by inhalation of 10 ml PBS (Si-PBS group), or to 100 mg of quartz in 100 ml PBS followed by inhalation of 100 mg aluminum lactate in 10 ml PBS (Si-Al group). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was repeated at monthly intervals for 6 months from before exposure (Month 0), and all sheep were autopsied at Month 6. All aerosol inhalations were carried out 24 h after BAL starting at Month 1 and monthly thereafter. In the PBS-PBS group and PBS-Al group, all BAL analyses remained at control levels and lung histology remained normal. In the Si-PBS group, BAL analyses documented significant sustained 3- to 10-fold increases in macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, immunoglobulins, lactate dehydrogenase, glycosaminoglycans, lecithin, and phosphatidylglycerol, with histopathologic changes of nodular silicosis (pathologic score, 2.9 +/- 0.9) and mean retention of quartz at 2.83 +/- 0.98 micrograms/mg lung tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89060672\r", 
  ".W": "Controversy exists whether high frequency oscillatory ventilation with an active expiratory phase (HFO-A) should be used at low ventilator pressures or high alveolar volumes to minimize lung injury in the atelectasis-prone lung. We therefore ventilated 20 anesthetized, tracheostomized rabbits made surfactant-deficient by lung lavage in 1 of 3 ways: HFO-A at a high lung volume (HFO-A/HI), HFO-A at a low lung volume (HFO-A/LO), or conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV); all received 100% oxygen for 7 h. We examined oxygenation, lung mechanics, and lung pathology. Arterial oxygenation in the HFO-A/HI rabbits was kept greater than 350 mm Hg. Mean lung volume above FRC in these animals was 23.4 ml/kg. In rabbits ventilated with HFO-A/LO and CMV, arterial oxygen tensions were 70 to 100 mm Hg. Mean lung volumes were 7.8 and 4.3 ml/kg, respectively. Total respiratory system pressure-volume curves (P-V curves) showed no change from baseline in the HFO-A/HI group after 7 h of ventilation. The low lung volume groups (HFO-A/LO and CMV) showed a diminution in hysteresis of their P-V curves, lower total respiratory system compliance, more hyaline membranes and severe airway epithelial damage. (All changes significant with p less than 0.05). We conclude that maintenance of alveolar volume is a key mechanism in the prevention of lung injury during mechanical ventilation of the atelectasis-prone lung. For optimal outcome using high frequency oscillatory ventilation, alveoli must be actively reexpanded and then kept expanded using appropriate mean airway pressures.\r"

However, it is unknown whether emphysema directly predisposes to the development of the necrotizing lesions of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. We evaluated this possibility using a murine model of pulmonary histoplasmosis. Using intratracheal inoculation of elastase, we induced pulmonary emphysema in Balb/c mice. When mice with emphysema were challenged intranasally with H. capsulatum (HC) yeast cells, the course of their disease was not significantly different from that of normal mice. Mice were also exposed to HC antigens by sublethal intranasal challenge with viable or heat-killed HC, or immunized with histoplasmin. Prior sublethal challenge with viable HC did not cause prolonged illness or increased mortality in the setting of emphysema. In contrast, such mice were protected against a severe rechallenge. Additional studies showed that intranasal administration of heat-killed HC or subcutaneous immunization with histoplasmal antigens had neither protective nor deleterious effects on the course of histoplasmosis. Therefore, in this murine model, we could not substantiate an interaction of underlying emphysema with acute primary or rechallenge pulmonary histoplasmosis.\r"

Newly developed technology (radiometric automated bacterial growth recording in the BACTEC system) has opened new opportunities for development of quantitative methods in mycobacteriology using liquid culture medium. This paper analyzes the potential applications to mycobacteriology of 4 quantitative criteria: Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC), and Fractional Bactericidal Concentration (FBC).\r"

We developed a computer algorithm to scan and detect dips in SaO2 data digitally stored as a time series by computer throughout overnight studies. Desaturations detected by computer were compared with the events detected manually in 9 all-night polysomnograms from 6 patients with typical obstructive sleep apnea. Events detected by one method but not the other were subsequently verified to determine the overall number of apnea-hypopnea events present and to determine false positive and false negative rates for the 2 methods of detection. The total number of apneas was 4,008. Both methods agreed on 3,639 of them. Of 77 manually recorded apneas not detected by computer, 24 were subsequently discounted (manual false positives, 24 of 4,007 = 0.6%) and 53 confirmed (computer false negatives, 1.32%). Of 358 events not detected manually, 316 were confirmed (manual false negatives, 7.9%) and 42 discounted (computer false positives, 1.1%). Using the final manual scoring as the reference, the computer program detected apneas with a sensitivity of 97.9%, and the predictive value of a computer-detected event was 90.8%. For event duration, a regression was performed on 3,623 matched apneas-hypopnea events, giving a coefficient of r = 0.9431, p less than 10(-6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-four rats were divided into a control (C) (n = 17) or a septic (S) group (n = 17). Animals were inoculated subcutaneously with 10(11) Streptococcus pneumoniae (S), or sterile culture media (C). All rats were studied 3 days after inoculation. Diaphragmatic strength and endurance capacity were studied in 11 animals of each group. Diaphragmatic strength was assessed by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves at different frequencies (0.5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 Hz). Endurance index was calculated as the ratio of Pdi generated after 30 s of phrenic nerve stimulation at 10 Hz divided by the initial force. Measurements of lung weights and lung histologic examinations were performed in the 6 remaining rats from each group. S animals were hyperthermic (39 to 40 degrees C rectal temperature). There was no evidence of pneumonia at histologic examination in Group S. No differences in wet weight of the lung and in the dry-to-wet weight ratio were noted in Group S as compared with Group C. However, S. pneumoniae was isolated from blood and lungs of S animals. Diaphragmatic weight was not different between S and C groups, whereas the weights of the extensor digitorium longus (EDL), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus muscles were significantly reduced in Group S as compared to Group C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We thought that repetitive ventilatory tasks might be similarly limited and that this dysfunction would likely contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue. We studied 9 patients with Parkinson's disease who had no evidence of restrictive or obstructive lung disease and 5 normal age-matched control subjects who performed repetitive, forced inspiratory resistive-loaded tasks. The time a given mean airway opening pressure could be sustained, the incremental oxygen cost of breathing, and the work rate of breathing (W) were measured. Although maximal static inspiratory pressures were comparable in both groups, 8 of the 9 patients could not sustain as high a W in the resistive-loaded tasks as could the normal control subjects (41.0 +/- 23.0 versus 67.7 +/- 29.1 J/min; mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01) and the efficiency of breathing was reduced (2.0 +/- 0.8 versus 3.8 +/- 1.4%; p less than 0.01). These findings are similar to derangements of task performance by peripheral skeletal muscle groups in Parkinson's disease.\r"

The subjects were mainly marine pipefitters (35%), plumbers (24%), and steamfitters/welders (23%); 28% had never smoked, 39% were ex-smokers, and 33% currently smoked cigarettes. Mean values for FVC and FEV1 were 95.0 and 91.9% of predicted, respectively, with mean FEV1/FVC ratio 77.7%; by standard criteria, 7.8% had restrictive impairment, and 21.7%, obstructive defects. Chest radiographs were normal in 63% and showed pleural abnormalities only in 17%, parenchymal abnormalities only in 7%, and both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in 12%. Both FVC and FEV1 correlated with the degree of small opacity profusion, as assessed by ILO grade. Pleural abnormalities were associated with lower FVC values, independently of ILO profusion grade for Grades less than or equal to 1/0, and were unexplained by smoking status. In addition, there was a positive association between smoking history and degree of ILO parenchymal abnormality, particularly in those with the heaviest cumulative smoking history. Our results suggest that the ILO classification of pneumoconiosis, although a useful epidemiologic tool, should be applied with caution in persons with asbestos exposure, and that pleural abnormalities may be associated with physiologic impairment in such persons.\r"

A community survey of 314 nonsmoking mothers and their children in Hong Kong, and 243 mothers and children in Japan showed that the prevalence of reported chronic cough and sputum symptoms was 10 or more times higher in Hong Kong than in Japan. The disparity in the rates of respiratory diseases/symptoms was most apparent in the comparison of children. Occupational exposure to dust or fumes and larger household sizes were found to be associated with higher levels of respiratory illnesses among the Hong Kong mothers. The much higher prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms among Hong Kong than among Japanese subjects correlated with each community's female lung cancer incidence rates of 27.1 versus 8.1/100,000, respectively.\r"

A self-administered mailed questionnaire was used to assess the lifetime environmental exposure to cigarette smoke at home and at work for each subject. Lung function information used here had been gathered in the course of a previous study of the determinants of lung function in early adulthood. In men, maximal midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) decreased in relation to an index of cumulative lifetime environmental exposure to tobacco smoke at home, after taking into account the effects of cumulative exposure at work as well as age, height, body size, respiratory pressures, and cooking fuels used at home. The components of this exposure index most closely related to the reduction in FEF25-75 were maternal smoking habits and exposure to second-hand smoke during childhood. In women, the diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) decreased in relation to cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke at work, after accounting for the effects of cumulative lifetime exposure at home and the other factors mentioned above. These findings contribute to the gathering evidence that environmental exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful to respiratory health, and suggest that the effects are not insignificant. For instance, the FEF25-75 of a young man 20 yr of age who had never smoked and always lived at home would be 800 ml less if both his parents smoked than if they did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis (CFHZ) have a higher prevalence of airway reactivity than do controls, we tested the hypothesis that CFHZ have a more rapid decline in pulmonary function with age or packyears of smoking than do controls. We performed spirometry on 280 parents of children with CF and 280 age-matched control parents of children with heart disease. The ALA-DLD-78 questionnaire was also administered to these volunteers. Although the CF parents report wheezing apart from a cold more frequently than control parents, they show no greater decline of pulmonary function (FEV1, FEF25-75%, or FEV1/ht3) with age or packyears of smoking than do controls. The complaint of wheezing apart from a cold contributes significantly to the variance of FEV1 and FEF25-75% even when the effects of height, age, packyears of smoking, sex, and CF heterozygosity are controlled. The hypothesis that obligate heterozygotes for CF have increased age- or smoking-related decline in airflow is not supported by these data. Instead, the results suggest that any pulmonary function abnormalities associated with CF heterozygosity are small and not clinically significant and that CF heterozygosity per se is not a major risk factor for development and progression of obstructive airways disease.\r"

Clinically, a greater than 15% improvement in the FEV1 is often used to define the \"increased\" response indicative of asthma. However, unlike other tests of lung function, reference standards derived from \"healthy\" members of a general population sample have never been reported. As part of a health survey carried out in Alberta, Canada, 2,609 subjects completed a standardized respiratory symptom questionnaire and had FEV1 measured before and 20 min after inhaling terbutaline sulfate via a 750-ml spacer device. Among asymptomatic never-smoking subjects with a FEV1 greater than 80% of predicted, the upper 95th percentile of bronchodilator response (BDR), when expressed as 100 x (FEV1 postBDR - FEV1 preBDR)/predicted baseline FEV1 averaged 9%. This value remained remarkably stable across gender, age (7 to 75 yr), and height groups, and deviated to 6% only when baseline FEV1 was greater than 120% of predicted. Consistent with other respiratory function variables, in which the upper limit of normal is often defined as the upper 95th percentile, our population-derived reference values provide a conceptual definition of BDR that can easily be applied to define \"increased\" response in the clinical setting.\r"

Therefore, we compared the driving records of 29 patients with obstructive sleep apnea with those of 35 subjects without sleep apnea. The patients with sleep apnea had a sevenfold greater rate of automobile accidents than did the subjects without apnea (p less than 0.01). The percentage of persons with one or more accidents was also greater in the patients with apnea than in the control subjects without apnea (31% versus 6%, p less than 0.01). The percentage of persons having one or more accidents in which they were at fault was also greater in the patients with apnea than in the control subjects (24% versus 3%, p less than 0.02). The automobile accident rate of the patients with sleep apnea was 2.6 times the accident rate of all licensed drivers in the state of Virginia (p less than 0.02). In addition, 24% of patients with sleep apnea reported falling asleep at least once per week while driving. We conclude that patients with obstructive sleep apnea have a significantly higher frequency of auto accidents than do subjects without apnea. Impaired drivers with sleep apnea may cause many preventable auto accidents.\r"

Ninety-seven patients with COPD were followed for 32 to 108 (median, 70) months after studies of overnight oxygenation. Significant relationships (p less than 0.001) were obtained between mean oxygen saturation (SaO2) asleep and awake. There was similarly a significant relationship between lowest SaO2 asleep and awake, but this relationship was improved by the inclusion of awake arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). The patients who were more hypoxic at night than predicted from these regression relationships had similar survivals to the patients who were less hypoxic at night than predicted, whether excess nocturnal hypoxia was defined in terms of mean or lowest SaO2 during sleep. In the 66 patients who did not subsequently receive long-term oxygen therapy, none of the indices of nocturnal oxygenation was related to survival, the only significant predictor of survival being daytime arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). For all 97 patients, both mean nocturnal SaO2 and lowest SaO2 during sleep were related to survival (p less than 0.05), and percent predicted vital capacity was also related to survival (p less than 0.05). Neither of the oxygen saturations during sleep significantly added to the more readily and cheaply measured percent predicted vital capacity in determining survival in these patients. Thus, in patients with COPD, excess nocturnal hypoxemia is not associated with an impaired prognosis, and so studies of oxygenation during sleep cannot be recommended in the routine clinical management of these patients.\r"

We wondered if lung distension due to gas trapping during the hyperpnea of exercise might cause the wedge pressure to rise by increasing juxtacardiac pressures above esophageal pressures. If this were so, then (1) tachypnea alone, without exercise, should cause the FRC and intracardiac pressures to increase in patients with COPD, (2) there should be an increase in FRC associated with the rise in wedge pressure on exercise, and (3) these changes should not occur in patients without COPD. We studied 39 patients with COPD (Ppa = 21 +/- 6 mm Hg [mean +/- SD], FEV1 [% predicted] = 39 +/- 16) and 13 control patients with similar pulmonary artery pressures but no airflow obstruction (Ppa = 22 +/- 20 mm Hg, FEV1 [% predicted] = 110 +/- 24). In those with COPD, light exercise raised the FRC by 0.5 +/- 0.5 L. Tachypnea alone, at the rate present during exercise, raised the FRC by 0.6 +/- 0.4 L and there was a 10% increase in left lower lobe area on lateral chest X-ray. Wedge, right atrial, and pulmonary artery pressures rose together during tachypnea with and without exercise. By contrast, in the control patients without COPD, the right atrial pressure change on exercise did not reflect that of the left atrium in extent or direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were studied within the first day from the onset of mechanical ventilation. Flow, changes in lung volume, and airway pressure were measured using the 900C Servo Ventilator. End-inspiratory and end-expiratory occlusions of the airway were performed to obtain respiratory compliance and resistance. We found that: (1) acute exacerbation of CAO was characterized by high respiratory resistance (reflecting in part time-constant inequalities within the lung) and severe pulmonary hyperinflation, with \"intrinsic\" PEEP (PEEPi) up to 22 cm H2O (mean [SD], 13.5 [6.7] cm H2O); (2) PEEPi, even if not high, was present in almost all patients with pulmonary edema, averaging 3.8 and 3.0 cm H2O in ARDS and CPE, respectively; (3) respiratory resistance was increased in patients with CPE and ARDS who had no history of airway disease; (4) patients with ARDS were characterized also by low compliance (mean [SD], 0.035 [0.005] L/cm H2O) and high resistance, the latter also reflecting a substantial component caused by time-constant inequalities; (5) in all 24 patients, static respiratory compliance (and its reciprocal, elastance) was significantly correlated with the pulmonary oxygenation index, i.e., the PaO2/PAO2 ratio. We conclude that early assessment of respiratory mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients with ARF can provide better understanding of the patients' conditions as well as guidelines for therapeutic approach and weaning attempts.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of purified human lung mast cells and mast cells in lung fragments to generate leukotriene B4 after immunologic (anti-IgE) and nonimmunologic (calcium ionophore, A23187) activation. Release of LTB4 was quantitated by 2 specific radioimmunoassays with biochemical characterization by high performance liquid chromatography. In a first series of experiments using radioimmunoassay 1, purified human lung mast cells (n = 10) released LTB4 in response to both an immunologic and nonimmunologic stimulus in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In response to an optimum concentration of anti-IgE (3 micrograms/ml), mast cells of 4.5 to 98% purity, generated 6.2 +/- 1.7 ng immunoreactive LTB4 (iLTB4)/10(6) mast cells. HPLC characterization revealed that 30 +/- 0.3% of the iLTB4 coeluted with standard synthetic LTB4 in these studies. In a second series of experiments using radioimmunoassay 2, mast cell activation resulted in the release of 0.5 to 1 ng iLTB4/10(6) mast cells with greater than 75% coeluting with synthetic LTB4. Thus, we estimate that human lung mast cells can generate approximately 1 to 2 ng of LTB4 per million mast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aims of the present study were to characterize the cell influx during the late-phase response to antigen challenge and to determine the effect of pretreatment with systemic steroids on this response. We examined cytospin slides of nasal washings obtained before and hourly for 11 h after nasal antigen challenge in 10 asymptomatic allergic subjects with a history of seasonal rhinitis and 5 normal, nonallergic subjects. Allergic subjects received oral prednisone (20 mg 3 times a day) or placebo in a random, double-blind crossover manner for 2 days before each of 2 challenges 1 month apart. On placebo days, a mixed cell influx occurred in allergic subjects during the late response that was 50-fold greater than the cell influx in the nonallergic control subjects (p less than 0.005). During the first 3 h after antigen challenge, eosinophils (p less than 0.005), but not neutrophils or mononuclear cells, were observed. During the late phase (4 to 11 h), neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells were all increased. Oral steroid pretreatment blocked the influx of eosinophils (p less than 0.005), but not that of other cells. These data demonstrate an inflammatory cell influx associated with the nasal late-phase response and suggest an important pathogenetic role for the eosinophil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As part of our initial evaluation of this newly recognized physiologic system in humans, we measured levels of gelsolin in plasma samples from patients with extensive lung injury. Gelsolin levels were depressed in 25 of 25 patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a disease characterized by massive cellular injury, as determined by either of 2 functional assays for gelsolin. Mean total gelsolin concentration of 20 patients with ARDS was 89.2 +/- 33 micrograms/ml (normal levels, approximately 240 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.001) and the mean free gelsolin concentration 69.6 +/- 29 micrograms/ml (normal levels, approximately 240 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "Perfluorochemical emulsions (PCE) have been used as blood substitutes because of their high solubility coefficient for oxygen. However, concerns for their clinical use include both the hyperoxia required by PCE to improve oxygen delivery to tissues and the effects of PCE on lung tissue. We addressed 3 questions: (1) What are the combined effects on the lungs of PCE blood replacement and hyperoxia? (2) Does reduction of circulating white cells by PCE blood replacement modify the injurious effects of hyperoxia? (3) Does PCE alone alter the lungs? Adult rats received either partial or complete PCE blood replacement or no PCE and were then exposed to 85% oxygen for 5 days. Other rats received partial PCE or no PCE and breathed air for 5 days. Morphometric and morphologic analyses demonstrated that lung injury was primarily caused by hyperoxia, independent of PCE treatment. Statistical analyses of the data indicated no synergistic effects between PCE and hyperoxia; furthermore, transient reduction of blood inflammatory elements by PCE blood replacement did not modify the extent of injury that occurred later. Importantly, however, rats that received partial PCE and air exposure were virtually identical to those that received no PCE and air exposure. Five days after blood replacement, PCE components were most often seen within alveolar and interstitial macrophages and infrequently within endothelial and epithelial cells. Although PCE itself may have produced functional alterations in lung cells, direct effects were not morphologically evident. Our results suggest that, if PCE are used at moderate FIO2, such as 0.6 or less, structural changes in the lungs could be minimized.\r"

  ".W": "In order to identify the physical and structural parameters that relate best to the membranolytic, inflammatory, and fibrotic potentials of different silicon dioxide (SiO2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) crystals, we have studied the potential of four different SiO2 and two different TiO2 crystal structures to lyse human red blood cells and to induce pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice. The crystals studied were quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, coesite, anatase, and rutile. Mice were injected intratracheally with each crystal at constant surface area. Inflammation and fibrosis were assessed 6 wk after crystal instillation by wet lung weight (lung index), protein concentration of lung lavage fluid, the level of hydroxyproline in the lung, and histologic examination. In vitro red blood cell (RBC) lysis was evaluated by incubating the crystals with 51Cr-labeled RBC and measuring the release of 51Cr into the medium. Known crystallographic data for each of the minerals were used to calculate the percent occupied volume. Biologic activity seemed to correlate with percent occupied volume, suggesting that surface molecular topology may be important in crystal-cell interactions. The crystals with more irregular surfaces and protruding oxygen atoms, which form surface pockets (quartz, tridymite, and cristobalite), showed a dramatic increase over saline controls for lung index (greater than 2 x), cell number and lavage protein concentration (greater than 4 x), and hydroxyproline level (greater than 2 x). The other more boxlike crystals (coesite, anatase, and rutile) displayed little change in these parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A chest radiograph showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Thyroid function tests showed her to be severely hypothyroid (T4 = 23 nmol/L; TSH greater than 50 mU/L). Measurement of maximal respiratory mouth pressures (expiratory: 50 cm H2O, normal, 94 +/- 33; inspiratory: 15 cm H2O, normal, 71 +/- 27) suggested global respiratory muscle weakness. Severe bilateral diaphragm weakness was demonstrated by a greatly reduced maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) (Pdi Pimax = 0, normal, 65 +/- 31 cm H2O; sniff Pdi = 25 cm H2O, normal, 121 +/- 25). No Pdi was detectable on stimulation of the right phrenic nerve, whereas, on the left, it was 11 cm H2O (normal 7 to 15 cm H2O). Phrenic nerve conduction time was prolonged to both sides (right, 12 ms, left, 10 ms; normal, less than 9.5 ms). The relaxation rate of Pdi after a maximal sniff and after bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation was abnormally slow (7.4%/10 ms, 6.3%/10 ms, respectively). Three months after starting treatment with thyroxine she had become euthyroid, and phrenic nerve conduction times and Pdi relaxation rates had returned to normal. Maximal respiratory pressures, vital capacity, and maximal voluntary ventilation improved progressively on treatment, although maximal respiratory pressures still had not reached the normal range after six months. We conclude that hypothyroidism may present with breathlessness due to respiratory muscle weakness and/or phrenic nerve neuropathy and is reversible with treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The view that intracellular changes during oxygen depletion are the primary cause of abnormal function and altered physiology was originally proposed by Paul Bert. From that time it remains a basic assumption that hypoxia in intact animals produces alterations of cell and organ function, and that by measuring the intensity of these disturbances or the intensity of the functional impairment produced by these disturbances, a clearer understanding of the impact and consequences of oxygen depletion should emerge. At present, intracellular changes are inferred from the measurement of extracellular signals such as blood pressure, arterial oxygen tension and pH, or hemoglobin saturation, which provide mean values of changes occurring over the entire body. However, cells and organs in different parts of the body respond differently to a given degree of hypoxia or ischemia, and measurements of extracellular variables cannot provide precise information about abnormalities in any specific organ. Extracellular variables also do not reflect adaptive responses of a specific organ such as autoregulation of its blood flow and the ability to alter energy demand in response to changes in energy production. Other factors include differences in metabolic rates and dependence upon oxidative and glycolytic reactions, cell heterogeneities within a tissue or organ, redistribution of blood flow to various organs during hypoxia, or other insults, and other, yet unknown, cell-specific changes that result in a range of survival capabilities among organs. These considerations suggest the importance of direct monitoring of intracellular changes produced by cardiovascular or respiratory diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examines how two potent activators of complement, zymosan, and cobra venom factor (CVF), affect systemic and visceral perfusion. Rats were injected with either saline (1 ml/kg), zymosan (5 mg/kg) or CVF (5 units/kg) at t = 0 and 30 minutes. Thermodilution cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and hematocrit were determined at t = 2 hours. Effective hepatic and renal blood flows, by clearance of galactose and p-aminohippurate respectively, were determined over the next hour. The per cent change in total hemolytic complement from t = 0 to t = 3 hours was determined by immune hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. There was no difference in systemic hemodynamic parameters between the three groups. Hepatic blood flow was depressed in both the zymosan (3.83 +/- 0.23 ml/min/100 g) and CVF (3.72 +/- 0.20 ml/min/100 g) groups compared with controls (4.62 +/- 0.19 ml/min/100 g, P less than 0.05). Renal blood flow in the zymosan-treated group (6.40 +/- 0.24 ml/min/100 g) increased over control (4.80 +/- 0.40 ml/min/100 g, P less than 0.05) but was unchanged in the CVF group (5.06 +/- 0.23 ml/min/100 g). The amount of complement activated correlated with the change in hepatic (r = -0.419, P less than 0.05) but not renal (r = -0.008, P = 0.917) flow. Complement activation may occupy a proximal position in the pathogenesis of hepatic ischemia associated with trauma and sepsis.\r"

To evaluate the management of perianal infections in patients with granulocytopenia and acute leukemia, all such patients treated at Emory University Hospital between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1985, were reviewed. Twenty patients were found to have severe granulocytopenia (fewer than 500 polymorphonuclear leukocytes/mm3) and perianal infection, representing 5.7 per cent of all hematology service admissions during that period. Eleven patients were managed conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive measures, and nine patients underwent operative drainage of the perianal infection in addition to conservative measures. The two groups were similar in respect to age, associated conditions, length of hospitalization, and degree of perianal infection, with the exception that operatively drained patients were more likely to have positive blood cultures (7/9 operatively drained; 4/11 conservatively managed). Mortality was higher in the operatively drained group (44.4% vs 9% in the conservatively managed), and three patients had progression of the local infection after drainage, two of whom required a diverting colostomy. The overall mortality attributed to perianal disease in these severely granulocytopenic patients was 25 per cent. From this review, operative drainage of perianal infection does not appear to increase survival or decrease morbidity in patients with severe granulocytopenia.\r"

A prospective study of organ failure (OF) was conducted for 203 consecutive admissions to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) between September 1986 and June 1987. Diagnosis, operations, age, OF, outcome, and culture data were recorded for each patient. OF definitions consistent with the literature were used to identify pulmonary, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular (CVS), gastrointestinal (GI), hematologic-coagulation, and central nervous system (CNS) failure. Eighty-two patients developed OF (40.4% incidence). The distribution of OF was 65 per cent trauma (T) and 35 per cent nontrauma (NT). Combined mortality for OF was 46 per cent (T = 34% and NT = 69%). The mortality of organ failure increased with the number of failed systems in the total population as well as in both T and NT groups. For the total population, the mortality by number of systems failed was no system, 1.3 per cent; one system, 13 per cent; two systems, 34.5 per cent; three systems, 75 per cent; four or more systems, 92.9 per cent. The incidence and mortality for each system is listed. Sepsis occurred in 62.1 per cent of NT patients (88.9% mortality) and in 30.2 per cent of T patients (31.3% mortality). Mortality was weakly associated with age in groups matched for severity of OF.\r"

Thirty minutes later, the dogs were bled rapidly into a reservoir to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg. After 60 minutes at 40 mm Hg (compensated shock), the reservoir line was clamped for 30 minutes (uncompensated shock). The shed blood was then reinfused over 30 minutes, and the dogs were monitored for an additional 60 minutes. At the start of uncompensated shock, 11 dogs were given at least 15 micrograms/kg of T3 IV, and 10 animals received saline. Before T3 treatment, there were no significant intergroup differences in the measured hemodynamic and blood gas variables. In the untreated group, 8 of 10 dogs (80%) died during uncompensated shock, in comparison to 3 of 11 dogs (27%) that received T3 (P less than 0.01). Long-term survival in the T3 group was 5/11 (45%), significantly higher than that (1/10, 10%) in the untreated group (P less than 0.05). These results, interpreted in relationship to previous studies, suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of T3 in canine hemorrhagic shock may be related to antagonism of adverse effects of endogenous rT3.\r"

There were six groups: controls (N = 30, no shock), two groups of shocked animals resuscitated with either hetastarch (HES, N = 13) or lactated Ringer's (LR, N = 13); the remaining three groups were identical except that splenectomy had been performed (N = 16, N = 14, and N = 16, respectively). One week after shock and resuscitation, all groups were challenged with intravenous Streptococcus pneumoniae; quantitative blood and tissue (liver, lung, and spleen) cultures were then obtained. There were no differences between the HES and LR groups. In nonsplenectomized animals, colony counts in the blood, liver, lung, and spleen were significantly higher in shocked animals when compared with controls. Splenectomized rats had no significant differences between shocked groups and controls. These data demonstrate that delayed immune function is depressed in nonsplenectomized rats. Splenectomy causes more severe immune dysfunction than does shock. Also, in similar animals without splenectomy, hetastarch does not appear to alter delayed RES function.\r"

DESIGN: Prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed and compared with data from a historical control group at the same institution and with published data. SETTING: The outpatient department of a bone and mineral metabolism clinic. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of patients with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed between 1 January 1976 and 31 December 1985. Criteria for inclusion in the study were the absence of symptoms due to hyperparathyroidism, no current kidney stone disease, no radiographic evidence of osteitis fibrosa, a serum calcium level of less than 3.00 mmol/L, a serum creatinine level of less than 133 mumol/L, and a forearm bone density value not more than 2.5 standard deviations below the age-, sex-, and race-adjusted normal value. INTERVENTIONS: A conservative nonintervention study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of vertebral fractures in 174 patients (mean age, 62 years) with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism was 1.7%; in a subset of white women, the prevalence was 2.8%. These rates were not higher than those expected, by comparison with the rate in a retrospective control group or with the risk for vertebral fractures in subjects of similar age, and may even be lower. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for vertebral fractures is not increased in patients with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism and is not a reason to recommend surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients. The increased rates of vertebral fractures that occurred in other series are probably due to the use of inappropriate controls and the influence of referral or selection bias, the inclusion of patients with severer disease, and the effect of geographic differences in vitamin D nutrition on the expression of disease. Possible differences between lateral spine and lateral chest radiographs for determining vertebral body shape need further study.\r"

The presence of these committees at small rural hospitals is a recent phenomenon. Because such hospitals are nonspecialized and isolated and have limited resources, they do not naturally encourage the development and growth of ethics committees. The experience of larger institutions with such committees is not readily adaptable, and role models are lacking. The experience of rural Vermont hospitals with ethics committees shows that these committees can function fully at small hospitals and have three stages of development. To accelerate the evolution of ethics committees at small rural hospitals, networking between these hospitals and an association with academic centers are needed. State medical societies can also support these committees by endorsing and sharing resources.\r"

When ribavirin was administered intramuscularly at the time of experimental infection with the lethal P3790 strain of Junin virus, all animals were protected from clinical disease. A delay in the initiation of therapy until after the onset of illness resulted in improvement and resolution of systemic signs of disease; however, survivors subsequently developed a late-onset central nervous system infection which was fatal in two of three animals. Side effects of ribavirin included thrombocytosis and severe anemia, both of which resolved promptly on withdrawal of drug therapy. Results of this study suggest that ribavirin may prove useful in treating humans with Argentine hemorrhagic fever.\r"

Each subject was studied on days 1 and 15 at the following dosages: 100 mg once daily (regimen A), 200 mg once daily (regimen B), and 200 mg twice daily (regimen C). On each study day, itraconazole was administered with a standardized meal. Plasma samples were collected for 72 h postdose, and 24-h urine specimens were obtained. On day 1 of regimen C, plasma samples were collected following the second dose. Samples were assayed for itraconazole by a sensitive, reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography method. Wide intersubject variations in itraconazole concentration in plasma versus time profiles were observed on all study days. Absorption appeared to be slow, with day 1 mean peak itraconazole concentrations in plasma of 110 ng/ml at 2.8 h (regimen A), 272 ng/ml at 3.0 h (regimen B), and 553 ng/ml at 3.4 h (regimen C). Mean peak itraconazole concentrations in plasma on day 15 were 412 ng/ml at 3.0 h (regimen A), 1,070 ng/ml at 4.4 h (regimen B), and 1,980 ng/ml at 6.0 h (regimen C). The steady state was achieved by day 13. Respective elimination half-lives on days 1 and 15 were 15 and 34 h (regimen A), 20.7, and 36.5 h (regimen B), and 25 and 41.7 h (regimen C), respectively. The areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves (0 to infinity) on day 1 were 1,320 (regimen A), 4,160 (regimen B), and 12,600 ng.h/ml (regimen C).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group 2 received doses adjusted to achieve peak levels in serum of 20 to 30 micrograms/ml and trough levels of less than 12 micrograms/ml; bone specimens were collected during surgical debridement. The specimens were pulverized and eluted into phosphate buffer, and the supernatants were analyzed for vancomycin content by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. In group 1, vancomycin was detectable in all cancellous specimens with a mean concentration of 2.3 +/- 4.0 micrograms/g (range, 0.5 to 16 micrograms/g); 10 of 14 cortical specimens had detectable vancomycin; the mean cortical concentration was 1.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/g (range, not detectable to 2.6 micrograms/g). In group 2, vancomycin was detectable in only two of five cortical bone specimens (mean concentration, 5.9 +/- 3.5 micrograms/g). Cancellous bone was obtained in one patient; the vancomycin concentration was 3.6 micrograms/g. In most patients the vancomycin levels in bones were higher than the MIC for susceptible staphylococci following single prophylactic doses. In the few infected patients studied, penetration was variable and deserves further study.\r"

Pretherapy isolates were all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Isolates were eradicated from 18 (82%) of 22 patients treated with ciprofloxacin and 12 (52%) of 23 patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during and 5 to 9 days after therapy (P = 0.035). Both groups had similar relapse and reinfection rates at 4 to 6 weeks posttherapy. Adverse effects were mild and reversible, occurring in 1 of 22 in the ciprofloxacin group and 6 of 23 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group. Disk diffusion susceptibility tests correlated better with broth macrodilution for ciprofloxacin than for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

However, growth on basal medium supplemented with individual selective factors and an agar diffusion assay revealed the bile salts contained in MacConkey agar to be toxic to both organisms. Four P. multocida surface hydrophobicity variants exhibited consistent in vitro susceptibility to the hydrophobic antibiotics novobiocin, rifamycin SV, and actinomycin D as determined by broth dilution. Readily extractable lipid fractions were obtained by chloroform-methanol extraction of freeze-dried whole cells from exponential-phase cultures. No major differences in total cellular readily extractable lipid content were observed among the P. multocida and A. lignieresii strains examined, although hydrophobic P. multocida strains appeared to contain slightly more than did hydrophilic strains. Analytical thin-layer chromatography and quantitation of resolved readily extractable lipid components revealed the major cell envelope phospholipids of both organisms to be phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol in a molar ratio of approximately 4:1 regardless of cell surface hydrophobicity properties. Similar results were obtained for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is notably refractory to hydrophobic molecules. These data support the conclusion that the permeability of the P. multocida cell envelope to structurally unrelated, hydrophobic molecules is not dependent on cell surface hydrophobicity and cannot be explained on the basis of anomalous polar lipid composition.\r"

A maximal concentration of 1,161 +/- 392 micrograms/ml was reached during h 2 in T-tube bile from 10 recently cholecystectomized patients, with a 24-h biliary recovery of 23.1%; urinary recovery over the same period averaged 49.4%.

The resistant strains contained an identical 6.8-kilobase plasmid, pRPG101. Transformation of pRPG101 into Escherichia coli produced high-level resistance to amikacin (greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml) and kanamycin (greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml) but unchanged susceptibilities to gentamicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin. The clinical isolates and transformants produced a novel 3'-phosphotransferase, APH(3'), that modified amikacin and kanamycin in vitro. The location and orientation of the amk gene encoding this APH(3') were determined by analysis of insertions in pRPG101 of the defective gene fusion phage Mu dII1681 (mini-Mulac). Cells containing plasmids with insertions into amk that had the lac operon fused to the amk promoter were selected as Lac+ and amikacin susceptible. A collection of these mini-Mulac insertions was mapped by restriction enzyme analysis. This characterization of amk facilitated its cloning as a 1.8-kilobase EcoRI-Bg/I fragment of pRPG101 into the pUC19 vector. E. coli strains containing this recombinant plasmid had APH(3') activity and demonstrated high-level resistance to amikacin and kanamycin (greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml) but were as susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin (less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml) as the strains harboring the original pRPG101 plasmid.\r"

From the combinations tested, four drugs (ethambutol, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin) were selected for more extensive study against 20 strains of M. avium complex. The inhibitory and killing synergism obtained with combinations of two, three, or four drugs was assessed by determining the fractional inhibitory concentration index and fractional bactericidal concentration index. Inhibitory synergism occurred against 90 to 100% of the strains for all drug combinations in which ethambutol was included. Killing synergism occurred against 85 to 95% of the strains when ethambutol was used in combinations which included either rifampin or ciprofloxacin. However, killing synergism occurred against only 45% of the strains when drugs were tested at concentrations that can be obtained in patient serum. In other experiments, rifabutin (Ansamycin) gave results that were comparable to those obtained with rifampin. Clofazimine did not show synergistic killing activity at a concentration that is achievable in serum for any of the drugs tested. Our results indicate that there is considerable variability in the antimicrobial susceptibility of M. avium isolates obtained from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This variability could have significant impact on the clinical response to various therapies.\r"

Its pharmacokinetic profile in pouch exudate was also examined. Cefpirome showed bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects in granuloma pouches infected in Escherichia coli Ec-7, and its effects were almost equal to those of the other antibiotics. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa TM-11 infection, cefpirome was more active than moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime and comparable to ceftazidime. Cefpirome had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus Smith infection among the five antibiotics, showing bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects. The level of cefpirome in pouch exudate peaked at 1 h after administration, with a value of 16.4 micrograms/ml, and declined in a pattern similar to that of ceftazidime. When compared in peak level, the exudate level of cefpirome was 1.8 to 2.6 times higher than the values of moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime. The in vitro exudate protein binding of cefpirome was 8.8%, which was the lowest among the antibiotics used.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the therapeutic effects of free and liposome-encapsulated amikacin on Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex infection by using the beige-mouse model of the disease. In the first series of studies, intravenous administration of four weekly doses of 5 mg of amikacin per kg encapsulated in large (approximately 0.4-micron diameter), unilamellar liposomes arrested the growth of M. avium-M. intracellulare complex organisms in the liver, as measured by CFU counts. M. avium-M. intracellulare complex levels in untreated animals and in those treated with the same dose of free amikacin increased by several orders of magnitude over 8 weeks. Liposome-encapsulated amikacin was also effective against M. avium-M. intracellulare complex organisms in the spleen and kidneys, reducing the CFU counts by about 1,000-fold compared with those of both untreated controls and free-drug-treated mice. In the lungs, a slight reduction in CFU was observed in the liposome-encapsulated-amikacin-treated group, but only at the 8-week point. Neither free nor liposome-encapsulated amikacin reduced the colony counts in the lymph nodes compared with those of control animals. Reductions in CFU in all organs greater than those caused by the liposome preparation could be achieved by intramuscular administration of free amikacin, but only at a 10-fold-higher dose given 6 days a week for 8 weeks. In the second series of studies, we investigated the effects of (i) doubling the dose of liposome-encapsulated amikacin and (ii) increasing the size of the liposomes and prolonging the treatment to five injections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The peak concentration of NY-198 in the lungs and sera of guinea pigs with experimentally induced Legionella pneumonia was higher than that of ciprofloxacin after oral administration. The overall survival rate was higher in animals treated with NY-198 than in those treated with ciprofloxacin. Thus, NY-198 appears valuable in the treatment of Legionnaires disease.\r"

However, when phytonadione (10 mg) (vitamin K1) was administered at the completion of each course of antibiotics, formation of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide was observed only during the cefotetan phase. It is probable, therefore, that cefotetan, a cephamycin antibiotic containing the N-methylthiotetrazole side chain, inhibits hepatic vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase. While hypoprothrombinemia and formation of abnormal prothrombin were not seen in healthy subjects, the effect of cefotetan on the coagulation status of vitamin K-depleted patients may be adverse.\r"

The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.\r"

In a study of 21 premature babies with cryptorchidism at 18 months post-term and 21 case matched controls, cryptorchid preterm infants failed to show the normal rise in plasma testosterone in the first postnatal week. This rise is thought to relate to residual maternal human chorionic gonadotrophin in the neonatal circulation. Infants with cryptorchidism also failed to show the later testosterone surge in the second month which has been related to endogenous gonadotrophin release. We speculate that inadequate stimulation of testosterone release by human chorionic gonadotrophin in the fetus might contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism in preterm infants. Our findings have implications for the medical treatment or possible prophylaxis of undescended testes in premature babies.\r"

Plasma triiodothyronine concentration was measured longitudinally in 280 preterm infants below 1850 g birth weight. Babies whose lowest recorded concentration was less than 0.3 nmol/l had, at 18 months' corrected age, 8.3 and 7.4 point disadvantages in Bayley mental and motor scales and a 8.6 point disadvantage on the academic scale of Developmental Profile II, even after adjusting for a range of antenatal and neonatal factors known to influence later development. Low concentrations of triiodothyronine were strongly associated with infant mortality, but not after adjusting for the presence of respiratory illness. There was no association between plasma triiodothyronine concentrations and somatic growth up to 18 months, and no association with necrotising enterocolitis or later cerebral palsy. Data on postnatal changes in plasma triiodothyronine concentrations are presented for reference purposes. While cited reference ranges for plasma triiodothyronine concentration appear suitable for well infants above 1500 g birth weight, smaller or ill babies often have very low values for many weeks. Our data are relevant to the debate on endocrine 'replacement' treatment in premature babies.\r"

  ".W": "Skin disinfection with povidine-iodine (PVP-I) is widely used in obstetrics. We evaluated the influence of PVP-I in mothers at delivery on the serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations of their infants at the time of screening for congenital hypothyroidism. The study covered 4745 infants who were either breast fed (3659, 77%) or bottle fed (1086, 23%); 3086 (65%) of them were born to mothers with no iodine overload (controls) and 1659 (35%) to mothers with iodine overload. Compared with the control group, the breast and bottle fed infants born to mothers with iodide overload had a shift of neonatal thyroid stimulating hormone concentration towards high values. The shift was maximal in the breast fed infants with a 25 to 30 fold increase in the recall rate at screening for congenital hypothyroidism (serum thyroid stimulating hormone greater than 50 mU/l) while in the bottle fed infants, the recall rate was barely modified. In conclusion, the use of PVP-I in mothers at delivery induces a transient impairment of thyroid function in their infants, especially if breast fed. This situation is detrimental to screening for congenital hypothyroidism. Consequently PVP-I is not recommended in obstetrics.\r"

During one year of treatment their mean (SD) height velocity increased from 3.4 (0.9) to 7.2 (1.7) cm/year and height prediction from 148.2 (4.4) to 150.0 (4.4) cm. All the girls except one had a height velocity increment of more than 2 cm/year and these velocities are above the age references for girls with Turner's syndrome. The girl with a low growth response had antibodies against growth hormone with high binding capacity (3.7 U/l). The height velocity increment was inversely correlated with age and bone age, but this might be partly due to the somewhat higher dosage/m2 body surface and kg body weight that the younger patients were given because of the rounding off of the dose. The better results of our study compared with those of other workers who used similar dosages but did not give the drug as often suggest that giving it daily might have increased the growth response as it does in children deficient in growth hormone.\r"
