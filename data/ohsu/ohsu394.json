  ".W": "Preclinical studies have demonstrated that trimetrexate is a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase from Pneumocystis carinii. On the basis of this evidence, this lipid-soluble antifolate was used as an antipneumocystis agent in 49 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and pneumocystis pneumonia. Simultaneous treatment with the reduced folate leucovorin was used as a specific antidote to protect host tissues from the toxic effects of the antifolate without affecting the antipneumocystis action of trimetrexate. Patients were assigned to three groups and treated for 21 days: in Group I, trimetrexate with leucovorin was used as salvage therapy in patients in whom standard treatments (both pentamidine isethionate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) could not be tolerated or had failed (16 patients); in Group II, trimetrexate with leucovorin was used as initial therapy in patients with a history of sulfonamide inefficacy or intolerance (16 patients); and in Group III, trimetrexate with leucovorin plus sulfadiazine was used as initial therapy (17 patients). The response and survival rates were, respectively, 69 percent and 69 percent in Group I; 63 percent and 88 percent in Group II; and 71 percent and 77 percent in Group III. Trimetrexate therapy had minimal toxicity; transient neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurred in 12 patients and mild elevation of serum aminotransferases in 4. We conclude that the combination of trimetrexate and leucovorin is safe and effective for the initial treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of patients with intolerance or lack of response to standard therapies.\r"

In particular, it has been suggested that protooncogenes such as c-fos may be rapidly induced in conditions that lead to neuronal plasticity and evoke permanent changes in the expression of effector genes. Concentrations of the c-fos proto-oncogene increase rapidly following depolarization-induced calcium influx in non-dividing neuronally differentiated PC 12 cells. Recently, the presence and induction of c-fos in the adult brain and spinal cord has been observed. Here we report that electrically-induced seizure activity, which leads to a permanent increase in the response of the brain to future seizures (kindling), rapidly and transiently increases c-fos protein-like immunoreactivity in the nuclei of granule cells in the rat dentate gyrus. These results suggest that c-fos protein is present within the nuclei of adult mammalian neurons, and could be involved in plastic changes in the nervous system associated with seizure activity.\r"

Marked fz mitotic clones from five alleles were generated and examined in the wing. Three alleles have a non-cell-autonomous hair polarity phenotype; wild-type cells distal to fz clones produce hairs that have an abnormal polarity. In contrast, fz clones of the other two fz alleles examined do not disrupt the polarity of neighbouring cells. These data suggest that fz has two mutably separate functions in establishing hair polarity on the wing. One function involves the transmittance and/or generation of a polarity signal along the proximal-distal axis of the wing. The second function involves the cellular interpretation of a polarity signal.\r"

Recently, several authors have suggested that one of the most significant hominid-like traits of australopithecines, delayed maturation, may not after all be valid. This is a radical departure from Mann's classic study of australopithecine maturation and palaeodemography based on dental eruption patterns. The resolution of this debate has important implications for the history of the biological and social evolution of the human species. In view of the controversies generated by recent studies, and particularly because the Taung skull is the type specimen of Australopithecus africanus, we have investigated the relevant anatomy of the Taung 'child' using computerized tomography. We conclude that the Taung 'child' shows some important dental maturational affinities with great apes, although as Dart noted, other hominid-like features are clearly present.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma membranes of epithelial cells are divided into apical and basolateral domains. These two surfaces are characterized by markedly different protein compositions, reflecting the ability of the cell to target newly synthesized membrane proteins to specific regions of the cell surface. This targeting capability is also apparent in the polarized release of secretory products. Recent studies using canine renal tubule (MDCK) cells have suggested that distinct sets of secretory proteins are released from their apical and basolateral poles. We report experiments designed to examine secretory protein sorting by MDCK cells. We have shown that secretion of basement membrane components (laminin and heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG] takes place from the basolateral cell surface and that this polarized release results from active sorting. The sorting process which mediates this polarized secretion requires an acidic intracellular compartment. MDCK cells treated with NH4Cl to raise the pH of their intracellular compartments, secrete laminin and HSPG by a default pathway which leads to their release in roughly equal quantities into the medium of both the apical and basolateral compartments.\r"

To prevent inopportune switching, HO transcription is restricted to a specific period in the haploid cell cycle, which is just after, and dependent on, the start of the mitotic cell cycle. A repeated promoter element (CACGA4) (refs 7-9) and two trans-acting activators (SW14 and SW16) have been identified, which are responsible for the periodic and start-dependent transcription of HO. To understand further the link between start and HO transcription, the SW16 gene has been cloned and sequenced. The SW16 protein is similar to the protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that is encoded by cdc10 an essential gene specifically required at the start of the cell cycle. The similarity between the SW16 and cdc10 products, and their common involvement with 'start', suggest that they may share a common mechanism for sensing or executing this critical control step in the cell cycle. The SW16 and cdc10 proteins also contain two copies of a repeated motif that occurs at least five times in the cytoplasmic domain of the Notch protein of Drosophila melanogaster.\r"

Under conditions of normal ICP, mannitol induced an 18% reduction of ICP at the end of the infusion and a further decrease to 38% below the initial level 10 minutes later. Pial veins and arteries remained more or less unreactive over 35 minutes, with changes never exceeding 2 to 3%. Administration of mannitol during elevated ICP (20 mm Hg) reduced ICP by 15% during the administration period; during the subsequent 15 minutes, ICP returned to pretreatment levels. Pial arteries remained unreactive during mannitol infusion; however, they started to dilate during the subsequent 15 minutes to +8%. Venous calibers showed no noticeable changes. It is concluded that mannitol in clinically relevant doses does not exert a significant constrictive effect on cerebral arteries and veins and that mannitol acts on ICP probably via an osmotic effect rather than by a direct effect on cerebral blood volume.\r"

  ".U": "88014518\r", 
  ".W": "Sixteen patients each received infusions of 1 g of mannitol per kg over 5 to 10 minutes, and serial determinations of intracranial pressure (ICP), systemic arterial blood pressure (SABP), central venous pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum Na+, K+, osmolarity, and fluid balance were carried out for 4 hours. Urine output was replaced volume for volume with 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl solution. We tested the hypothesis that patients with high (greater than or equal to 70 torr) CPP would respond less well to mannitol by either ICP or CPP criteria than patients with low (less than 70 torr) CPP. The rationale for this hypothesis was based upon the association of low CPP with autoregulatory vasodilatation, whereas high CPP is associated with vasoconstriction. If mannitol should work by a vasoconstriction mechanism, the ICP effects should be most apparent under conditions of low CPP. Those patients with CPP greater than or equal to 70 torr responded relatively poorly to mannitol, with ICP decreasing from 25 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 5 (SE) mm Hg at 45 minutes postinfusion. Patients with CPP less than 70 responded with ICP declining from 35 +/- 5 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg. The initial SABP was 81 +/- 5 mm Hg in the CPP less than 70 group and immediately rose to 90 +/- 7 at 15 minutes postmannitol. The SABP increase correlated with ICP (r = -0.40, P less than 0.01), but not when CPP greater than or equal to 70. SABP was significantly higher in the latter group (105 +/- 6) and increased to 107 +/- 8 postmannitol. The ICP decrease began immediately with the SABP increase. No mannitol \"rebound\" occurred in these patients. Measures of acute volume expansion all correlated with ICP (Na+, r = -0.67, P less than 0.001; hematocrit, r = -0.27, P less than 0.01; serum osmolarity, r = 0.32, P less than 0.05) when CPP less than 70 torr. None correlated with ICP when CPP greater than or equal to 70. These data suggest that mannitol infusion is at least partly dependent upon hemodynamic mechanisms that allow vasoconstriction to occur with reduction in cerebral blood volume and that little may be gained by using mannitol when CPP greater than or equal to 70 either by SABP, ICP, or CPP criteria because vasoconstriction is already nearly maximal. This mechanism is not exclusive of other potential mechanisms of action. Mannitol \"rebound\" may be a function of net dehydration, hemoconcentration, and SABP decline.\r"

All hemostatic test results were remarkably similar in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. FPA levels and size of the lesion on CT were the only variables independently predicting mortality in a multivariate regression analysis. Our findings demonstrate that hypercoagulability is an important prognostic factor in stroke and lend support to clinical trials of drugs interfering with the coagulation system in the early phase of cerebral ischemia.\r"

Class I antigens were detected in the trabecular meshwork on frozen sections and on cultured trabecular cells. Class II antigens were constitutively expressed on some, but not all, cells within the trabecular meshwork. Many more cells could be induced to express class II antigens by pre-incubation in human gamma interferon. Cultured trabecular cells did not express class II antigens constitutively, but expression could be induced by gamma interferon. This study suggests that, in addition to Langerhans' cells at the limbus, other cell types within the anterior segment express major histocompatibility complex-encoded class II antigens either constitutively or inducibly. These cells may be important for the initiation and regulation of ocular immunity.\r"

Such preventive treatment, however, may trigger the transient appearance of penicillin-resistant bacterial strains. In order to investigate the behavior of oral streptococci, 29 healthy volunteers who did not harbor penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci received 4 gm of phenoxymethyl penicillin orally over a period of 10 hours. This amount constituted the sole dose of antibiotics administered in the entire experiment. Daily specimens of oral flora were obtained for 14 successive days from each participant and incubated aerobically with a penicillin-saturated disk for 24 hours. Viridans streptococci were considered resistant when bacterial colonies grew adjacent to the disk for 1 day or more. The study population was divided into high- and low-resistance groups, according to the individual antibiograms. Resistant viridans streptococci were already detected at 6 hours after penicillin ingestion in nine (31%) of the subjects. Six months later, oral specimens were taken from ten randomly selected participants; these specimens served as a control. The difference in bacterial resistance between the high- and low-resistance groups was significant for the duration of 9 days, as was that between the high-resistance and control groups (p less than 0.05 in both cases). In order to minimize the odds that penicillin-resistant bacterial strains will develop in patients susceptible to infective endocarditis, elective dental treatments in these persons should be scheduled in intervals of not less than 10 days.\r"

This was the first time in the 20-year history of the National Hospital Discharge Survey that there was a statistically significant decrease in children's hospital discharge rates in a 1-year period. The change occurred during a period when prospective hospital payment systems were introduced and when prepaid group health plans and alternative systems of providing health care were expanding. The unprecedented decrease in children's hospital use was evaluated using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey. This is a continuous survey in which data from a national sample of medical records of discharged patients are collected. Children's hospital use rates were reviewed by age, sex, region, and expected principal source of payment. Significant decreases in discharge rates were found for the age group 1 to 4 years and for all children with private insurance. The patterns and changes in hospital use by diagnostic category were also investigated. The major finding was a 19% decrease in children's discharge rate for diseases of the respiratory system. Mortality statistics and data from the National Health Interview Survey were evaluated for indications of changes in children's health status or use of physician services accompanying the decline in hospital use. Although there were fewer deaths due to respiratory diseases for children less than 5 years of age in 1984 than in 1983, most measures of health status were unchanged. The only significant change in physician use was a decrease in the percentage of acute conditions that were medically attended, also among children less than 5 years of age. It is important to continue monitoring children's hospital use patterns, as well as their health status and use of alternative health services, to further assess the impact of changes in the organization and financing of health services.\r"

In healthy children, plasma ANP and cyclic GMP levels ranged between 2.4 and 98.0 (mean 45.8) pg/mL and 0.2 to 2.8 (mean 1.40) pmol/mL, respectively. In children with cardiac diseases, plasma ANP (26.0 to 499.7 [mean 188.7] pg/mL) and cyclic GMP (0.2 to 6.0 [mean 2.9] pmol/mL) levels were significantly higher than in control children (both P less than .0001). There was a linear correlation between the two values in children with cardiac diseases (P less than .01). Because the effects of ANP to target tissues are mediated by cyclic GMP, cyclic GMP appears to be a marker for the cellular responses to ANP. The increased cyclic GMP levels in children with cardiac diseases indicate that ANP exerts its effects on target organs also in states of chronically enhanced ANP levels.\r"

A mutant repressor, previously shown to contact DNA as wild-type repressor does with the exception of a missing contact to guanosine G4' [Hochschild, A. & Ptashne, M.

  ".W": "Binding of cytochrome c to cytochrome c oxidase induces a conformational change in both proteins as well as a change of the electronic structure of the heme of cytochrome c, indicating an altered heme c-protein interaction. This follows from the observation that the induced circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of the oxidase-cytochrome c complex in the Soret region differ from the summed spectra of oxidase plus cytochrome c. Spectral changes occur in the complex composed of either the two ferric or the two ferrous hemoproteins. The difference CD and MCD signals saturate at a ratio of 1 heme c per heme aa3. The difference spectra are specific to the cognate complex. The results are interpreted to reflect a direct relationship between the recognition/binding step and the electron-transfer reaction. The conformational rearrangement induced in cytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase consists of a structural rearrangement of the heme environment and possibly a change of the geometry of the heme iron-methionine-80 sulfur axial bond. This rearrangement may decrease the reorganizational free energy of electron transfer by adjusting the heme c geometry to a state between that of ferri- and ferrocytochrome c.\r"

The argR control region contains two promoters, one of which overlaps the operator site and, as with other arg genes, consists of two adjacent palindromic sequences (\"ARG boxes\"). The arginine repressor protein and an arginine repressor-beta-galactosidase fusion protein were purified, and the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal end of the repressor protein portion of the fusion protein was determined. Antibodies prepared against the fusion protein react with the repressor. The repressor is precipitable by L-arginine, which facilitates its purification. The native repressor is a hexamer with a molecular weight of 98,000; its monomeric subunit has a molecular weight of 16,500. To verify its properties postulated from genetic studies, we show that in the presence of L-arginine, repressor inhibits transcription of argF and binds to the ARG boxes of argF and argR.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of mRNA encoding preproatrial natriuretic peptide was investigated in tissue sections and cultures of rat heart and in sections of human right atrial appendage using the technique of in situ hybridization with 32P- and 35S-labeled RNA probes. Rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) transcripts were demonstrated in numerous atrial myocytes and, to a lesser extent, in ventricular myocytes in both tissue sections and newborn rat heart cultures. These findings are consistent with those obtained by RNA blot analysis of rat heart total RNA, indicating that a single prepro-ANP transcript of approximately 900 nucleotides was present in the ventricles as well as the atria. Using a 35S-labeled RNA probe for human ANP mRNA, ANP transcripts were also localized to the majority of myocytes in the human right atrial appendage. Only background levels of autoradiographic labeling were obtained when RNA probes identical to the coding sequence of rat or human ANP mRNA were used. A close correlation was found between the distribution of ANP immunoreactivity and prepro-ANP mRNA in these preparations. These results provide unequivocal evidence for the expression of the ANP gene in the rat ventricles, as well as the atria, because myocytes in these tissues have been established as the sites of both ANP localization and precursor biosynthesis. The combined use of cardiac cultures and in situ hybridization may be of value in future studies investigating the regulation of ANP synthesis in cardiac myocytes.\r"

To adapt this marker for gene expression studies, a sequence encoding a modified beta-galactosidase and including the simian virus 40 large tumor nuclear location signal (nls-beta-Gal) has been introduced into vectors. In differentiated cells, multipotential cells, and embryos, the constructs led to the expression of an enzymatically active protein. Its location was examined by its beta-galactosidase activity or by using antibodies and electron microscopy. The results show that the nls-beta-Gal protein remains mainly located at the nuclear periphery (probably at the nuclear pores) but does not reach the nucleoplasm. It suggests that an interaction with the nuclear membrane is necessary but not sufficient for protein uptake into the nucleus. In multipotential cells, the expression of nuclear location signal LacZ (nls-LacZ) interferes neither with cell growth nor with differentiation. Using various lacZ constructs, the transcriptional activity of embryos was studied. At the two-cell stage, the promoters of the Rous sarcoma virus, simian virus 40, and the beta-actin gene are functional but the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat is not. Thus, transcriptional specificity must already be present at the stage of activation of the embryonic genome.\r"

  ".W": "Recent molecular analyses of Burkitt lymphomas carrying the t(8;14) chromosome translocation have indicated that a dichotomy exists regarding the molecular mechanisms by which the translocations occur. Most sporadic Burkitt tumors carry translocations that apparently arise due to mistakes in the immunoglobulin isotype-switching process. In contrast, there is evidence that the translocations of most endemic Burkitt lymphomas occur as a consequence of aberrant V-D-J recombination of variable, diversity, and joining gene segments, catalyzed by the recombinase enzymes. This phenomenon was first noted in follicular lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemias of the B-cell lineage and has been described in T-cell malignancies as well. In each of these cases, analysis of the nucleotide sequence at chromosome breakpoints demonstrated the involvement of immunoglobulin heavy chain JH or T-cell-receptor alpha-chain J alpha gene segments in the translocation. We now have cloned and sequenced both the 8q- and 14q+ translocation breakpoints deriving from the t(8;14) translocation of the endemic Burkitt lymphoma line Daudi. Our data show that the translocation resulted from a reciprocal exchange between the DH region on chromosome 14 and sequences far 5' of the MYC protooncogene on chromosome 8. Features of the nucleotide sequences surrounding the breakpoint further implicate the V-D-J joining machinery in the genesis of chromosome translocations in endemic Burkitt lymphomas and, more generally, in other lymphoid malignancies as well.\r"

The shape of the dissociation curve was still sigmoidal, although the Hill coefficient was decreased. The life span of InsP6-loaded erythrocytes equaled that of control erythrocytes. The long-term physiological effects of the InsP6-loaded erythrocytes on piglets were increased O2 release and reduced cardiac output. The reduced O2 affinity of the InsP6-loaded erythrocytes was still effective 20 days after transfusion in awake piglets. The electrolyte concentration appeared stable over the 5-day observation period except for a transient, but significant, hyperkalemia immediately after transfusion. The reductions in the O2 affinity of Hb reported here are large compared with previously reported values. Introduction of InsP6 into viable erythrocytes improves tissue oxygenation when, for any reason, normal blood flow is impaired.\r"

To provide a ready source of this hybrid molecule and to allow tailoring of the active moieties for optimal activity, we have engineered a recombinant version of the 59D8-t-PA conjugate. The rearranged 59D8 heavy chain gene was cloned and combined in the expression vector pSV2gpt with sequence coding for a portion of the gamma 2b constant region and the catalytic beta chain of t-PA. This construct was transfected into heavy chain loss variant cells derived from the 59D8 hybridoma. Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed with electrophoretic transfer blots. These revealed a 65-kDa heavy chain-t-PA fusion protein that is secreted in association with the 59D8 light chain in the form of a 170-kDa disulfide-linked dimer. Chromogenic substrate assays showed the fusion protein to have 70% of the peptidolytic activity of native t-PA and to activate plasminogen as efficiently as t-PA. In a competitive binding assay, reconstituted antibody was shown to have a binding profile similar to that of native 59D8. Thus, by recombinant techniques, we have produced a hybrid protein capable of high-affinity fibrin binding and plasminogen activation.\r"

  ".W": "Fly photoreceptor membranes were used to test the effect on defined biochemical reactions of light and of compounds causing photoreceptor excitation. Complementary electrophysiological studies examined whether putative second messengers excite the fly photoreceptor cells. This analysis revealed the following sequence of events: photoexcited rhodopsin activates a G protein by facilitating GTP binding. The G protein then activates a phospholipase C that generates inositol trisphosphate, which in turn acts as an internal messenger to bring about depolarization of the photoreceptor cell. Binding assays of GTP analogs and measurements of GTPase activity showed that there are 1.6 million copies of G protein per photoreceptor cell. The GTP binding component is a 41-kDa protein, and the light-activated GTPase is dependent on photoconversion of rhodopsin to metarhodopsin. Analysis of phospholipase C activity revealed that this enzyme is under stringent control of the G protein, that the major product formed is inositol trisphosphate, and that this product is rapidly hydrolyzed by a specific phosphomonoesterase. Introduction of inositol trisphosphate to the intact photoreceptor cell mimics the effect of light, and bisphosphoglycerate, which inhibits inositol trisphosphate hydrolysis, enhances the effects of inositol trisphosphate and of dim light. The interaction of photoexcited rhodopsin with a G protein is thus similar in both vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors. These G proteins, however, activate different photoreceptor enzymes: phospholipase C in invertebrates and cGMP phosphodiesterase in vertebrates.\r"

  ".W": "The grave challenge posed by the recent pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is not the first time mankind has faced such a threat. Useful lessons may be drawn from the successful global Smallpox Eradication Program and applied to the current campaign in the areas of surveillance, strategy, operations, and evaluation. The most important epidemiologic characteristic of this new infection is the unprecedented observation that virtually all asymptomatic infected persons are infectious and will remain so indefinitely. In combatting this infection we should concentrate our efforts in the United States on preventing transmission from the estimated 1.5 million persons who are already infected. We must make the best use we can of all the tools we already have: public information, health education, counseling and serologic testing of persons at high risk, treatment and prevention of intravenous drug abuse, and serologic screening of organ and tissue donors. Adequate confidentiality of test results needs to be secured in order to promote voluntary testing as an important means of achieving behavorial change among persons who are most likely to have been exposed to the infections. Persons whose sexual or drug abuse behavior puts them at higher risk of infection are the highest priority target group. They should be sought at every opportunity, whether seen in public clinics or private practice, and advised to be tested. In order to focus on preventing sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission of the virus we must avoid numerous potential distractions and irrelevant issues: we don't have time for them.\r"

  ".W": "Beginning in the latter part of 1985, 2,047 gay and bisexual men who were enrolled in the Pitt Men's Study, the Pittsburgh cohort of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), were invited by mail to learn the results of their antibody test for HIV infection--human immunodeficiency virus infection. Participants were asked to complete and return a questionnaire designed to assess the factors influencing their (a) decision about learning the results, (b) recent sexual behavior, (c) knowledge about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and (d) attitudes toward AIDS risk reduction. Of those men, 1,251 (61 percent) accepted the invitation, 188 (9 percent) declined, and 608 (30 percent) failed to respond. Fifty-four percent of the cohort subsequently learned their results. There were no significant differences in demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics or HIV seroprevalence between the men who accepted and those who declined. However, significant demographic differences were noted between the men who responded to the invitation versus those who did not; the latter group was composed of a greater proportion of men who were younger, nonwhite, and less educated. The most frequently cited reason (90 percent) why men wanted their test results was to determine if they had been infected with HIV. Of those who declined, 30 percent cited concerns about the psychological impact of learning about a positive result as being the most important factor for their decision. The two most frequently selected reasons for declining were the belief that the test is not predictive of the development of AIDS (48 percent) and concern about the worry that a positive result would produce (48 percent).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight of the nine best descriptive studies indicated that alcohol exposure was more likely among those who died in fires ignited by cigarettes than those attributable to other causes. It can be concluded that there is substantial, although not definitive, evidence that alcohol plays a role in the etiology of fire and burn injuries and deaths.\r"

  ".U": "88016793\r", 
  ".W": "A large amount of research has been devoted to identifying the psychosocial and demographic correlates of personal preventive health practices. An additional factor to consider, however, is the stability of personal health practices over time. At least over short periods, the prediction of current behavior may be substantially improved by having information about an individual's previous performance of the practice being studied. To address this question, data from Wave 1 (1979) and Wave 2 (1980) of the National Survey of Personal Health Practices were examined. Using nine health practices as indices, performance reported at Wave 1 was used to predict performance of that same practice as reported at Wave 2, 1 year later. A two-step analysis strategy was followed to estimate how much more variance could be explained when the behavioral reports were added to a list of psychosocial and demographic predictors. Results showed that over the 1-year interval, the Wave 1 behavioral reports were by far the strongest predictors of their corresponding measures obtained at Wave 2. The explained variance was increased substantially for most of the nine health practices, suggesting a strong tendency for persistence of the practices. Psychosocial and demographic variables tended to account for much smaller amounts of variance and often dropped out of the prediction equation when the Wave 1 behavior report was entered in the second step of analysis. Health practices other than the corresponding Wave 1 index did not improve prediction of the Wave 2 index greatly. The tendency for previous behavior to persist may overshadow the influence of other factors and account for the modest amounts of explained variance that are usually found for psychosocial and demographic indices in cross-sectional surveys. Although stability does not imply rigidity or impossibility of change, the strength of prediction found in these data attest to the \"force of habit\" that community interventions can encounter.\r"

They consume a disproportionate share of health and social services at a time when government is attempting to contain costs. Both countries face similar problems in caring for the elderly--problems of escalating hospital costs, dramatically increased nursing home costs, and insufficient public revenues to cover their entire care. Denmark has developed a wide range of services for the elderly--home help, home nursing, adult day care centers, day nursing homes, and sheltered housing. The response in the United States has taken somewhat different directions, although in both countries home and community services have been expanded as a substitute for expensive institutional care. The possible relevance of the U.S. experience in these areas to Denmark and lessons that the United States might learn from the Scandinavian country are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "An examination of length, weight, and birth weight data routinely collected from the clinics supported by the Navajo Nation Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) showed an association between birth weight and subsequent growth status. Navajo children less than 2 years of age entering the WIC Program were divided into low, normal, and high birth weight groups, and their growth patterns were plotted when they returned periodically for reassessment. Overall, the children tended to have low length-for-age and high weight-for-length measures, relative to the reference population, that suggest suboptimal nutritional status. Children with birth weights less than 2,500 grams (g) were consistently shorter, lighter, and thinner than children with birth weights greater than 2,500 g. Although the overall growth status of the children improved between 1975 and 1980, the growth among the children with low birth weights never fully caught up with that of the other Navajo children. Moreover, during that period, the normal birth weight group had a modest improvement in length-for-age relative to the reference population, but the low birth weight group did not. These findings suggest that prenatal interventions to improve the birth weight status of Navajo infants may result in improving the growth status of Navajo children.\r"

Although these groups often have health care beliefs inconsistent with Western primary care, their compliance with basic provider expectations (such as appointment keeping and appropriate emergency room use) remains largely unstudied. In the case of Samoans in Hawaii, concern is often expressed that a group much in need of health care (pediatric hospitalization and acute illness visit rates are high) often seems \"out-of-sync\" with Western health care. Four measures of noncompliance were studied in the Hawaii pediatric primary care residency training program. Enrolled Samoan patients were compared with an aggregation of more established ethnic groups. Four matched case-control studies controlled for socioeconomic status and the presence or absence of medical insurance and a home telephone. Samoans were more likely than the comparison group to miss health maintenance appointments, to drop in without an appointment, and to use the emergency room for nonurgent problems when a same-day-notice clinic visit would have usually sufficed.\r"

  ".W": "To provide hospital dental programs with useful information about the expansion of dental services and the identification of pertinent financial information, a production function and cost function analysis was performed. Results showed that hospital ownership (public or private) and size of the dental clinics were associated with the cost of providing dental services and the volume of services provided. Among 23 hospitals studied, private hospitals had a much lower cost per visit, had more paid attending dentist staff, paid their resident dentists less, and had significantly more billings paid by Medicaid and by patients than public hospitals. When stratified by ownership and size, these basic differences were accentuated for the small clinics. Except for primarily the Medicaid and self-pay billings, the characteristics of large public and private hospital dental clinics were extremely similar. Multiple regression analysis found that a decrease in cost per visit was associated with more visits to dentists and more to hygienists. Production of dental services could be increased by increasing the number of attending dentists, hygienists, and residents. Preliminary econometric analysis reveals that the optimal mix of attending dentists to resident dentists should be approximately 1.8 full-time equivalent (FTE) resident for every 1 attending FTE dentist to produce the most dental services at the lowest cost.\r"

  ".U": "88016798\r", 
  ".W": "Coexistent diabetes and hypertension affect an estimated 2.5 million persons in the United States. Hypertension occurs approximately twice as frequently in persons with diabetes as without and contributes to most of the chronic complications of diabetes, including coronary artery disease, stroke, lower extremity amputations, renal failure and, perhaps, to diabetic retinopathy and blindness. The proportions of complications in the diabetic population attributable to hypertension range from 35 to 75 percent. Hypertension in the diabetic population increases with age and is particularly associated with obesity and nephropathy. Limited data suggest the control of hypertension in the diabetic population may be better than in the general population, perhaps due to greater contact that persons with diabetes have with the health care system. Yet, in approximately half, hypertension is not controlled. Control strategies for hypertension in the diabetic population must take into account the higher frequency of hypertension, increased risks for adverse sequelae from the coexistent conditions, more complicated clinical management, and the greater contact with the health care system experienced by persons with diabetes. Community programs to improve hypertension control in the diabetic population may target a subset of the diabetic population and should tailor strategies to meet the needs of the target population. Hypertension control in the diabetic population must be addressed at multiple levels in the health care system, including improved detection, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension; improved adherence to antihypertensive therapy and long-term followup; provision of quality professional education and patient education and support; and systematic health care monitoring and program evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All respondents were recruited from a Chicago neighborhood with one of the nation's highest rates of poverty, infant mortality, and births of low birth weight infants. The neighborhood also has been targeted as a demonstration site for an Illinois Department of Public Aid's prepaid Medicaid program. Responses to the first interview indicated that neighborhood residents did not understand the operational features of Medicaid prepaid plans or the programmatic mission of these plans, and they did not want to enroll in existing prepaid plans. As determined in the second interview, residents desired information on the scope of Medicaid services, ways to assess quality of health care received, and options for maintaining their freedom to choose hospitals and physicians or clinics. The survey findings are compared with what is known about the reasons middle class employed families enroll in and disenroll from prepaid plans and the position of poor families in a cost-conscious health care system.\r"

Dehydration, if not treated, can quickly become a medical emergency. If, however, signs of diarrhea and dehydration are recognized and treated early, medical complications may be avoided. Fortunately, some homeless people now have access to shelter facilities that provide health education and services. Education is a fundamental tool in the prevention of disease. For homeless children sick with diarrhea, an educated parent may mean the difference between life and death. Therefore, an educational program was developed to help homeless parents recognize and treat mild, acute diarrhea and secondary dehydration. Participants were urged to treat mild diarrhea at home with oral rehydration therapy, thus preventing expensive medical treatment and hospitalization. The project was based on a format used in workshops designed for battered women's shelters. The program's philosophy reflects the belief that people possess many answers to problems, but often lack the opportunity or encouragement to make use of their knowledge.\r"

Southeastern Idaho has the highest birth rate of any region in the State, and this situation has created a large group of children susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. The mobile unit, which consists of a specially equipped motor home, allows easy access to immunizations for groups of children and their parents. A search of the computerized record system installed in the mobile unit can provide data on past immunizations for each registered child. The target audience for the mobile unit's visits is church groups because of the particular cultural demographics of this region. In 1987, the District Seven Health Department, a State- and county-funded agency, expects to increase the number of doses of vaccine given by 3,000 over the 19,953 given in 1986. The \"Shots for Tots\" program is unique in the State of Idaho. Its expansion may be anticipated as the unit becomes better known in the region. The alternative to using aggressive, innovative techniques to motivate people to become immunized is disease.\r"

  ".W": "Disseminating health information to parents from school-based programs is beneficial in at least four ways: children need the support of their parents if they are to implement the behavior changes they learn in school, parents can benefit from the information themselves, adults may be especially willing to learn about promoting health when they have young children in the home, and efforts to promote healthful behavior changes among children may be more effective if interventions are aimed at attitudes and habits of the family rather than those of individual persons. In this paper are summaries of published research on influencing parents in youth-directed health education interventions, including recent data collected in the Minnesota Heart Health Program. Following the review of the literature is a plan for an in-home nutrition and physical activity intervention that could maximize the impact on the eating and exercise patterns of the parents and their children. Very little research has been reported on how important parents are as participants in the health promotion efforts directed to their children. Funding this proposal would help researchers to learn more about maximizing the impact of primary prevention interventions by studying a process for improving eating and exercise patterns of the family unit--the children and their parents--that could serve as a model health promotion program.\r"

Three of these patients were treated by decompressive laminectomy and each made a good recovery. At surgery new bone formation in the ligamentum flavum and thickening of laminae were found to be responsible for the canal stenosis and cord compression. Two of these four patients, and 10 others were examined by computed tomography to determine the incidence, site and extent of any intra-spinal new bone formation. Facet joint hypertrophy and thickened laminae were observed at some level in all the patients, but much the most important cause of spinal canal stenosis was new bone formation in the ligamentum flavum, in the mid and lower thoracic spine, occurring at several, but mainly contiguous vertebral levels. Severe spinal canal stenosis was found in eight of the 12 patients scanned. No obvious relation was found between the presence of intra-spinal new bone formation and the clinical severity of the disease or the presence of extra-skeletal ossification in para-spinal and other sites. Computed tomography offers a simple, non-invasive technique for identifying those patients at risk of cord compression from new bone formation.\r"

Four patients had normal or equivocal myelographic appearances, but the coincidence of unexplained lower cord or cauda equina lesions with evidence of bilharzia led to the presumed diagnosis of spinal cord bilharzia. These patients, together with data from 39 cases reported in the world literature since 1969, have been used to compile a clinical profile of this condition. The clinical picture is the product of two types of reaction to bilharzial infestation, granuloma and necrotic myelitis, affecting the lower cord and cauda equina in varying proportions. Granuloma is the better defined entity because it is diagnosed following operation and biopsy. Myelitis is seldom proved and its diagnosis depends on circumstantial evidence. Both S. mansoni and S. haematobium may be responsible for either type.\r"

The CCD, with its high resolution, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, photometric accuracy, and geometric stability, can provide data of such high quality that quantitative analysis on two- and three-dimensional microscopic images is possible. For example, the three-dimensional imaging properties of an epifluorescence microscope have been quantitatively determined with the CCD. This description of the imaging properties of the microscope, and the high-quality image data provided by the CCD, allow sophisticated computational image processing methods to be used that greatly improve the effective resolution obtainable for biological structures. Image processing techniques revealed fine substructures in Drosophila embryonic diploid chromosomes in two and three dimensions. The same approach can be extended to structures as small as yeast chromosomes or to other problems in structural cell biology.\r"

Yet, prior to activation, these cells do not express IL-2 receptors recognized by monoclonal antibodies to the Tac antigen. A novel glycoprotein (IL-2R beta), identified on several lymphocytoid cell lines, has the ability to bind IL-2 alone and to associate with Tac antigen (IL-2R alpha) to form high-affinity IL-2 receptors. It is now reported that IL-2R beta is expressed on both circulating T lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes in quantities approximately proportional to their responsiveness to IL-2. Studies of the responses of these cells to IL-2 suggest that IL-2R beta mediates the initial phase of induction of lymphokine activated killer (LAK), natural killer (NK), and proliferative activities. Subsequently, IL-2R alpha is induced and functional high-affinity IL-2 receptors are expressed.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone is important in the regulation of synthesis and secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary, but its role in the control of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is controversial. To determine whether thyroid hormone regulates the function of TRH in the hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular system, a study was made of the effect of hypothyroidism on thyrotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA (proTRH mRNA) and TRH prohormone in the rat paraventricular nucleus. Extracts of rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were examined by quantitative Northern blot analysis, and coronal sections of rat brain were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. A nearly twofold increase in proTRH mRNA was observed in hypothyroid animals; this increase could be obliterated by levothyroxine treatment, suggesting an inverse relation between circulating thyroid hormone and proTRH mRNA. In situ hybridization showed that this response occurred exclusively in medial parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. A simultaneous increase in proTRH mRNA and immunoreactive TRH prohormone in this region suggests that hypothyroidism induces both transcription and translation of the TRH prohormone in the paraventricular nucleus.\r"

However, some retinal neurons appear to release transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium influx. It was uncertain whether depolarization released calcium from an intracellular store or released transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium. The possibility that voltage, and not calcium, can regulate the release of transmitter was studied with pairs of solitary retinal neurons. Horizontal and bipolar cells were isolated from fish retinas and juxtaposed in culture. Communication between them was studied with electrophysiological methods. A horizontal cell released its neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid, when depolarized during conditions that buffered the internal calcium concentration and prohibited calcium entry. The speed and amount of material released were sufficient for a contribution to synaptic transmission.\r"

These newly sequenced orthologs [an additional 4.9 kilobase pairs (kbp) for each species] were combined with published psi eta-gene sequences and then compared to the same orthologous stretch (a continuous 7.1-kbp region) available for humans. Phylogenetic analysis of these nucleotide sequences by the parsimony method indicated (i) that human and chimpanzee are more closely related to each other than either is to gorilla and (ii) that the slowdown in the rate of sequence evolution evident in higher primates is especially pronounced in humans. These results indicate that features (for example, knuckle-walking) unique to African apes (but not to humans) are primitive and that even local molecular clocks should be applied with caution.\r"

The complete heavy chain gene was cloned, and the effects of deletion of this gene were studied. The null mutation (chc1-delta) is lethal unless a suppressor of clathrin deficiency (scd1) is present. Even in the presence of the suppressor gene, mutants lacking the clathrin heavy chain grow slowly, are genetically unstable, are morphologically abnormal, and show loss of or reduction in several yeast functions.

There were 22 females and 37 males. Payment based upon a DRG system would have resulted in hospital losses for the following subgroups: surgical treatment (n = 44) $1,348,009; no operation (n = 15) $125,085; length of stay (LOS) of more than ten days (n = 35) $1,124,778; LOS equal to or less than ten days (n = 24) $348,316; nonsurvivors plus LOS equal to or less than ten days plus operation (n = 12) $269,778, and survivor plus LOS greater than ten days plus operation (n = 29) $1,022,284. No useful modifier was identified for these subgroups using regression analysis. We believe that some immediate DRG modifier, based upon the total hospital charges (or costs if known) relationship to total DRG payments, should be created until further refinements in payment systems evolve. If some correction is not attempted, the considerable disadvantage which would result to participating hospitals may result in curtailing availability of effective long term intensive care unit trauma care at a time when the public is becoming aware of trauma systems and the improvement in survival seems to be a realizable goal.\r"

False-positive scans (failure to visualize the gallbladder in the absence of cholecystitis) have been reported to occur in fasted patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). To determine the prevalence of false-positive scans in this patient population and identify factors that might be associated with scan outcome, hepatobiliary imaging was performed in fasted patients receiving TPN and without clinical evidence of acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder nonvisualization occurred in 18 of 50 (36%) patients. In the group whose gallbladders did not visualize, a significantly higher male to female ratio (15:3 versus 17:15; p = 0.016), alkaline phosphatase (346 +/- 84 IU/L versus 212 +/- 32 IU/L, p less than 0.04), total bilirubin (1.7 +/- 0.3 mg/dl versus 1.0 +/- 0.2 mg/dl, p less than 0.02), and lower serum albumin (2.4 +/- 0.01 gm/dl versus 2.8 +/- 0.2 gm/dl, p less than 0.02) levels were noted. In 18 patients, gallbladder ultrasonography was also performed, and the presence of sludge or a thickened gallbladder wall did not correlate with scan outcome. The prevalence of false-positive hepatobiliary scans in fasted patients receiving TPN is significant and does not always correlate with a syndrome of acute gallbladder inflammation. The results of such scans must therefore be interpreted with caution in these patients.\r"

Whether such a mixed-fuel system is as effective as a hypertonic glucose-only TPN fuel system in achieving an anabolic state was tested in 88 consenting patients randomized to either conventional TPN (25% dextrose and 4.25% amino acids) or modified TPN (15% dextrose, fat, and 5% amino acids). Treatment groups were: group A, no surgery, TPN only; group B, postoperative TPN starting 48 hours after surgery; and group C, preoperative TPN, surgery on day 7 and with continued postoperative TPN. In all groups TPN was given for 14 days while patients were given nothing by mouth. Changes in the indexes of body protein metabolism, reflected by nitrogen balance, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, and weight, were measured on days 1 and 14. Nitrogen balance improved in patients randomized to either regimen, but there was no significant difference in the degree of improvement. Albumin levels were maintained, and differences between initial and final values were not significant. Blood urea nitrogen increased in all groups (p less than 0.05); however there was no significant difference between regimens. Patients maintained their weight, and fluid balance data indicated no water retention. Observed weight changes were not statistically significant. In each treatment group an anabolic state occurred and gains in measured protein indexes were similar. Isocaloric replacement of 30% of TPN glucose calories with fat was as effective as glucose-only TPN in achieving an anabolic state without the metabolic complications associated with glucose-only TPN.\r"

  ".U": "88018518\r", 
  ".W": "Until recently, when a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was suspected of having catheter-related sepsis, the catheter was removed and the tip and the patient's blood was cultured. Using this method at our institution, greater than two thirds of the central venous catheters (CVC) removed were sterile, or if colonized, proved not to be the source of sepsis. This practice led to the unwarranted removal of numerous catheters and posed a clinical dilemma because it necessitated replacement of the catheter with its attendant risks, cost, and inconvenience. To address this problem, we instituted a protocol for determining in situ catheter-related sepsis based on a quantitative blood culture method using lysis centrifugation (Isolator; Dupont Co., Wilmington, Del.). When catheter-related sepsis was clinically suspected, quantitative blood cultures were obtained simultaneously via a peripheral (PER) vein and through the CVC suspected as the source of sepsis. The CVC, however, remained in situ pending culture results (approximately 16 to 24 hours). A CVC colony of greater than or equal to five times the PER colony count was considered significant and the catheter was removed. Equivocal colony counts between the CVC and PER cultures were interpreted as incriminating a source of sepsis other than the CVC. An 8-month prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this method for determining in situ catheter sepsis. One hundred third-eight patients received TPN by means of 160 catheters. In 113 patients no sepsis-related problems were noted. In the remaining 25 patients, 28 catheters were suspected as the source of sepsis. Twenty-six catheters were evaluated by the Isolator culture method. In eight instances significant differences in colony counts between the CVC and PER cultures were seen, implicating the CVC as the source of infection. In all these cases the CVC was removed and the patients underwent defervescence. In 18 cases, the CVC samples revealed either no growth or insignificant differences between the CVC and PER colony counts. Nine of these CVCs were removed without clinical improvement. The remaining nine catheters were left in place, and another source of sepsis was ultimately identified and treated. These results confirm the use of the quantitative blood culture method for determining in situ catheter-related sepsis. In all cases, when the catheter was incriminated by culture data, removal of the CVC led to patient improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Augmentation of NK cell activity by IL-2 was dose- and time-dependent. The results indicate that the optimal dose of IL-2 was 100 to 500 U/mL, and that cytotoxicity increased significantly even at a low concentration such as 4 U/mL. IL-2 induced significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity against renal carcinoma cells than did gamma-interferon. The influence of IL-2 on lymphocyte subpopulations was then examined using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies OKT3, OKT4, OKT8, Leu 7, and Leu 11. The results showed that IL-2 increased the number of cells positive to Leu 11, the so-called active NK cells. We concluded that IL-2 has an important role in the treatment of renal carcinoma.\r"

In 29 patients who received thrombolytic therapy, recanalization was seen (group 1) and in 7 it was not (group 2). In 23 patients (79%) in group 1 scintigraphic findings were positive and in all 7 in group 2 they were negative. In 15 patients (52%) in group 1 and 1 patient (14%) in group 2, CK reached its peak level within 16 hours. In 20 patients (69%) in group 1 and 3 (43%) in group 2 the CK-MB level reached a peak within 16 hours. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of positive results of early Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy in predicting the reperfusion were 79%, 100% and 83%. These values are significantly higher than or similar to those of early peaking of CK and CK-MB release. In contrast to measurements of enzyme release, reperfusion data for Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy are available immediately after thrombolytic therapy. Therefore, early Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy (3 to 8 hours after onset of symptoms) is valuable as a noninvasive technique for early diagnosis of reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with essential hypertension were separated into 2 groups, renin-unresponsive and renin-responsive, on the basis of their plasma renin response when challenged by furosemide and upright posture. The response to acute infusion of hypertonic saline solution (1.4% saline solution at a rate of 0.3 ml/min/kg over 60 minutes) was then studied. In the renin-unresponsive group, peak rate of fractional excretion of sodium and peak urine flow after saline loading were 7.6 +/- 0.7% and 476 +/- 34 ml/hour, respectively, and peak value of atrial natriuretic polypeptides (ANP) was 784 +/- 140 pg/ml. In the renin-responsive group, the values were 3.1 +/- 0.4%, 194 +/- 29 ml/hour and 115 +/- 33 pg/ml. Both fractional excretion of sodium, urine flow and ANP response were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the renin-unresponsive group. Moreover, a highly significant relation (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01) was observed between fractional excretion of sodium and ANP levels in all hypertensive patients. The degree of saline-induced natriuresis was not related to blood pressure, heart rate, endogenous creatinine clearance, antidiuretic hormone or preexisting level of aldosterone. Plasma renin activity changed little in either group during saline infusion, but tended to be higher at all times in the renin-responsive patients. The present findings suggest that the enhanced secretion of ANP is an important determinant for exaggerated natriuresis observed in patients with renin-unresponsive hypertension.\r"

Subjects were free of symptoms after consuming flavored and unflavored yogurts. Of seven commercial yogurts tested, all contained significant levels of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). In addition, eight subjects were fed meals of milk, ice milk, ice cream, and frozen yogurts with and without cultures containing high levels of beta-gal. Peak hydrogen excretion after consumption of frozen yogurt with high beta-gal was less than one-half of that observed after the other five test meals and intolerance symptoms were absent.

A variety of abnormal histological findings were present in patients without positive aluminum stains (n = 12) who were supported solely by regimens utilizing crystalline amino acids. However, neither decreased TBA (median TBA = 15.3%) nor decreased RBF (median RBF = 126 micron2 X mm-2 X d-1) was uniformly characteristic of the latter patient group.\r"

Various vascular tumors were characterized with immunoperoxidase staining with the use of a polyclonal anti-TM serum. The staining patterns of TM were compared with those of Factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RAG) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), which have been used as markers for endothelial cells. The results showed that TM is a specific and a highly sensitive marker for angiosarcomas in comparison with FVIII-RAG or UEA-I. In contrast, UEA-I is more sensitive for benign vascular tumors than TM or FVIII-RAG. The other mesenchymal tumors of nonvascular origin showed negative staining for three endothelial markers. These results indicate that TM is a new specific and sensitive tool for the diagnosis of angiosarcomas.\r"

(3) The presence of monoclonal B-lymphocytes bearing surface IgD (kappa) in the peripheral blood was demonstrated in three of four patients whose B-cell subpopulation was mentioned. (4) Generally speaking, nonsecretory IgD (kappa) MM showed the combined features of usual IgD MM and nonsecretory MM.

We found that newly referred and returning families required 7.1 and 4.0 h, respectively. Average collections for professional services were +135 (+19/h) for new families and +49 (+12/h) for returning families. Income from clinical practice covered 37% of the clinical portion of personnel costs. These results indicate that cognitive clinical genetics services are labor intensive, yield low payments per service hour, and are not financially self-supporting. To improve the economic status of genetics clinics, administrators might consider rendering services more efficiently; increasing charges for services; billing for all services provided to all family members; billing for all genetics professionals, including counselors and social workers; and requesting payment at the time of service.\r"

When protease-treated isolated mitochondria were used, activity of the respiratory-chain enzymes was found to be approximately 60% of normal, and adenosine triphosphate synthesis was found to be normal with all substrates tested. In mitochondria prepared by means of digitonin treatment, adenosine triphosphate synthesis was depressed with all substrates tested, suggesting a defect in the operation of the cytochrome oxidase complex. In disrupted whole cells from the patient, cytochrome oxidase activity was 56% of the activity in the control cell line with the lowest activity. In the presence of a twofold excess of oxidized cytochrome c, patient cells showed 31% of the activity in controls. Cytochrome oxidase activity in both sonicated whole-cell preparations and in sonicated mitochondria displayed abnormal kinetics with regard to the substrate-reduced cytochrome c, which was particularly evident in the presence of excess oxidized cytochrome c. We believe that kinetically abnormal cytochrome oxidase complex is responsible for the biochemical and clinical abnormalities present in this patient.\r"

This study demonstrated that hemodialysis is associated with significant platelet activation and loss, which are influenced by both dialyzer configuration and membrane composition. In addition, use of the cuprophan membrane is associated with greater perturbations of the vascular endothelium, as reflected in changes in factor VIII-related von Willebrand factor and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations not seen with the polyacrylonitrile membrane. Of the dialyzers studied, the polyacrylonitrile membrane in a hollow-fiber configuration appears to minimize platelet loss and activation, and to minimize increases in factor VIII-related von Willebrand factor and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha.\r"

  ".W": "In a cohort of 764 evaluable patients with primary breast cancer, we have compared the ability to deliver full doses of adjuvant chemotherapy in two patient groups: one undergoing conservative breast surgery plus irradiation and the other having modified radical mastectomy as primary treatment for the cancer. We have also analyzed the toxicities of the concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. The group having irradiation had significantly more moderate leucopenia, which caused a short delay (median, three weeks) in the overall time necessary to complete the planned chemotherapy. However, among those patients who completed the planned chemotherapy cycles, the fraction who received more than 85 percent average drug doses was 96 percent or higher in all but one small subgroup. Interaction between the irradiation and chemotherapy caused mild breast skin reactions in 42 percent of patients so analyzed and worse reactions in 12 percent. When follow-up tracings were performed, mild electrocardiogram abnormalities occurred in 19 percent of patients, apparently because of the irradiation. We conclude that intravenous adjuvant chemotherapy, as administered in this study, can be delivered as intensely with conservative primary treatment as after mastectomy and that toxicity is mild, rarely requiring intervention or treatment discontinuation.\r"

Among the 120 infections, treatment was rated as appropriate in 49 percent, as inappropriate in 42 percent, and as unjustified in 9 percent. Cephalosporins received the lowest percent of appropriate ratings (27 percent). The primary reason for an inappropriate rating was that a more effective drug was recommended for empiric therapy of gram-negative bacillary infections. These bacteria are often resistant to oral antibiotics. There were no significant differences in appropriateness by type of organism, infection site, or clinical outcome. Physician education and the development of systems and guidelines for optimal management in this population are appropriate actions for the future.\r"

Immunosuppressive therapy may temporarily normalize factor II levels in patients with the lupus anticoagulant-hypoprothrombinemia syndrome and reduce the risk of excessive hemorrhage.

Six published repetitive immunogenic amino acid sequences from the circumsporozoite (CS) antigen, ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), soluble (S) antigen, and falciparum interspersed repetitive antigen (FIRA) of P. falciparum, and the CS protein of P. vivax, were analyzed by computer. Matches of at least 4 amino acids were found for all sequences. In the database, 29 matches were found for human proteins and 26 matches were found for human viruses with the 6 antigen sequences. Most of the matched proteins, and many of the matched human viruses, are found in blood. The biological significance of these matches remains to be clarified.\r"

Serum antibodies were first detectable by ELISA at two months post-challenge in both challenged (C) and vaccinated-challenged (V-C) baboons (serum dilution 1:200). By four months post-challenge, ELISA absorbance values for subgroup C baboons were significantly higher than for V-C counterparts. The immunoblot technique provided a more sensitive means of detecting antibody early in the infection. One month post-challenge, 7 of 12 C and V-C sera (diluted 1:100) contained measurable anti-proteinase antibody. By month two, 12 of 12 were immunoblot-positive.

Liver granulomas were the largest at 8 weeks and contained low amounts of type I and higher amounts of type III collagen and fibronectin. Collagen deposition became pronounced as infection progressed. The relative amounts of type I collagen deposits rose and equalled that of type III. In the smaller immunomodulated granulomas at 20 weeks both types I and III were high, and type IV collagen deposition was observed. Fibronectin and laminin deposits were also detected. The small ileal granulomas did not change their size during the course of the infection. At 8 weeks, connective tissue matrix deposition was barely detectable within these lesions. Gradually, small deposits of types I and III appeared in equal amounts and attained highest levels by 20 weeks of the infection. Fibronectin deposits at that time were very prominent but laminin and type IV collagen were absent. Colon granulomas at 8 weeks of the infection were only somewhat smaller than those of the liver, yet contained very sparse deposits of types I and III collagen. During the ensuing weeks collagen deposits rose only slightly. By 20 weeks the granulomas diminished in size and within those lesions type III collagen was predominant. Whereas the presence of fibronectin was pronounced, type IV collagen and laminin were detectable only in trace amounts. These observations indicate the existence of important organ-related differences in the intragranulomatous deposition of connective tissue matrix.\r"

Framework invasion almost invariably takes place in ossified or calcified cartilage, and the reason for this has never before been adequately explained. The finding of increased density on some computerized tomography scans where the tumor was invading the framework stimulated this study of the mechanisms of this type of spread. One hundred fifty-eight consecutive laryngeal specimens were examined by a serial sectioning method to elucidate this. Several laryngeal specimens were examined for alkaline phosphatase in the tissues, and two specimens were examined for collagenase. A method of tetracycline labeling was used to measure the amount of osteoblastic activity in another two specimens. Framework invasion occurred mainly at the glottic level and exclusively in ossified or calcified cartilage. This type of invasion was associated with osteoblastic activity which appeared to be at least partially mediated by tumor-produced alkaline phosphatase. Osteoclastic activity took place hand-in-hand with the former process, and at this stage, tumor remained outside the perichondrium. Tetracycline labeling confirmed active bone deposition in these areas and appeared to explain the finding of increased ossification seen on computerized tomography scans where early invasion was taking place.\r"

Haemodynamic variables were measured for 10 minutes after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Heart rate did not change significantly in either group. Systolic as well as mean arterial blood pressure increased significantly for the first 5 minutes in the control group, whereas patients in the nitroglycerine group showed a decrease in systolic as well as in mean arterial pressure.

Therefore, six New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with approximately equal to 1.0 MAC halothane (mean end-tidal concentration 1.26%) and surgically prepared for recording of ICP, the EEG, and both cortical and global CBF (by the H2-clearance method). After preparation was complete, measurements were obtained during ventilation with 70% nitrogen (in O2), and after the inspired gas mixture was changed to 70% N2O (still with 1.0 MAC halothane). Two such data pairs (N2-N2O) were obtained, one during hypocarbia (PaCO2 approximately equal to 20 mm Hg) and the other during normocarbic (PaCO2 approximately equal to 40 mm Hg) conditions. Mean arterial pressure (MABP) was held constant within each data pair by infusing angiotensin II as needed. Nitrous oxide resulted in a consistent increase in EEG frequency and decrease in amplitude as compared with N2, and produced small (approximately equal to 1 mm Hg) but statistically significant increases in ICP during both hypo- and normocarbic conditions. Nitrous oxide administration also increased CBF as measured both in frontal cortex and globally, with similar changes seen during hypo- and normocarbic conditions, e.g., cortical CBF increased from 42 +/- 8 to 59 +/- 15 ml.100 gm-1.min-1 during hypocarbia, and from 61 +/- 13 to 75 +/- 15 ml.100 gm-1.min-1 during normocarbia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electrocortical activity, umbilical blood flow, heart rate, and umbilical arterial and venous pressures were continuously monitored in experiments comprising a baseline period, a drug infusion period and a recovery period, each of 2 hr duration. Samples of umbilical arterial and venous blood were taken for blood gas analysis, and for bupivacaine assay using high pressure liquid chromatography technique. Fetal plasma bupivacaine levels were 1.3 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml (mean +/- SEM) between 60-120 min of infusion. Heart rate and umbilical blood flow decreased significantly to 89 and 94% of control, respectively, (P less than 0.05) during the infusion and returned to control levels by 2 hr afterwards. Mean umbilical arterial and venous pressures were not significantly altered, and no significant rise in umbilical vascular resistance occurred. No changes occurred in umbilical arterial or venous pH, PO2, or PCO2. In summary, bupivacaine reversibly depressed fetal heart rate and umbilical blood flow without detrimental changes in fetal blood gas or acid-base status.\r"

Animals were tracheally intubated and paralyzed, and background anesthesia was maintained with morphine sulfate and nitrous oxide. Following injury and attainment of an elevated and stable ICP, animals were divided into four groups. Animals in groups I and III were maintained normocapnic throughout the experiment and administered 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane, respectively. Group II and IV animals were made hypocapnic (PaCO2 = 20 mmHg) prior to the administration of either 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane, respectively. Monitored variables were mean arterial blood pressure, ICP (ventriculostomy), end-tidal (ET) CO2, ET volatile anesthetic, the electroencephalogram, temperature, and arterial blood gases. Prior to producing the lesion, ICP was approximately 5 mmHg in all animals with no differences among groups. Sixty to ninety minutes after injury, ICP increased significantly to approximately 20 mmHg in all animals. Introduction of either halothane or isoflurane was associated with significant increases in ICP in all groups to approximately 30 mmHg. These data suggest that further significant increases in ICP may occur following introduction of either halothane or isoflurane in the presence of acute brain injury and elevated ICP. Furthermore, these ICP increases may not be altered by the prior establishment of hypocapnia.\r"

  ".W": "The American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control recommend that each hospital has a tuberculosis screening program. As the incidence of active tuberculosis in the United States has been decreasing during the last 30 yr, the necessity for continuing this screening program may be questioned. This prospective study evaluates whether screening hospital employees is still useful. In the state of Washington from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 1984, tuberculosis was diagnosed in 747 patients, of whom 387 (52%) were hospitalized. One hundred seventy-one of the hospitalized patients (44%) were sputum-smear-positive. Data were collected from each of the 114 hospitals in the state. During the 3-yr period, 50 hospitals admitted no patients known to have M. tuberculosis, 48 admitted 1 or more sputum-smear-positive patients, and 16 others admitted 1 or more smear-negative patients. The number of employees at each hospital ranged from 10 to 6,289 (539 +/- 757, mean +/- SD). Skin testing was performed on 13.7 to 100% (median, 84.2%) of employees. In the 3-yr period, 126,493 skin tests were placed by trained personnel; 501 employees were reported as being converters, but only 129 were found to be true converters. The conversion rates of employees in hospitals to which patients with smear-positive and smear-negative disease were admitted were 1.05 and 1.09 per 1,000, respectively. The conversion rate in hospitals where no patients with M. tuberculosis were admitted was 0.8 per 1,000. These conversion rates were no greater than that predicted for the general population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pregnant does were treated with betamethasone, T3, TRH, or combinations of betamethasone plus T3 or TRH using doses of each agent known to effect lung maturation. Preterm rabbits were then delivered at 27 days gestational age, half of each group was treated with Surfactant TA, and the rabbits were ventilated in a ventilator-plethysmograph system such that tidal volumes were regulated to mean values of 12 to 13 ml/kg. At 30 min of age when mean PCO2 values for the study groups were between 33 and 42 mm Hg, lung function of each rabbit was evaluated by the peak inspiratory pressure needed to achieve the desired tidal volume, by compliance, and by the ventilation efficiency index. These measures of lung function showed no benefit of corticosteroids or T3 in the absence of surfactant, whereas TRH significantly improved lung function. Although surfactant treatment improved lung function in all groups, the best effect after a single hormone treatment was with corticosteroids. The combined use of corticosteroids and TRH in surfactant-treated animals resulted in the best overall responses. The leak of protein into and out of the lungs was measured with radiolabeled albumins. The leak decreased as peak ventilatory pressures decreased in all groups and decreased with surfactant treatments of all groups. Corticosteroids decreased the protein leak into the airways more than could be accounted for by the effects of corticosteroids on ventilatory pressures alone (p less than 0.01). None of the hormone treatments significantly increased the saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes from the low values noted in the control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These giant cells are thought to be formed from macrophages by fusion, but its mechanism is not fully understood. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a lymphokine that activates macrophages. In this report, we examined the in vitro effect of recombinant IFN-gamma on activation and fusion of human alveolar macrophages. Adding IFN-gamma to the culture promoted fusion of alveolar macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but untreated control macrophages remained mostly mononuclear. The fusion rate attained a maximum of about 20% on Day 5, and the number of nuclei per cell increased in parallel with the increase in IFN-gamma concentration. Adding IFN-gamma also activated some functions of the alveolar macrophages, as measured by increased glucose consumption and cytostatic activity against HeLa cells. Maximal cytostatic activity was obtained by adding 1,000 units/ml of IFN-gamma. The glucose consumption of alveolar macrophages from patients with cancer was relatively low, but IFN-gamma restored their glucose consumption approximately to the level in a healthy volunteer and in patients with pneumonia. Dexamethasone inhibited both the fusion and the activation of alveolar macrophages induced by IFN-gamma. These results suggest that IFN-gamma is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary granuloma formation by inducing activation and fusion of alveolar macrophages. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone appears to reflect its therapeutic effects in treating patients with granulomatous lung diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed by inhalation to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and challenged 5 min or 4 h later with bronchoconstrictive aerosols of histamine or the divalent cationic ionophore A23187. Pulmonary gas trapping measured in excised lungs indicated the severity of post-challenge airway obstruction. Airway granulocyte infiltration was scored by an observer who was unaware of animal assignments. Treatment with LTB4 produced a marked influx of eosinophils and neutrophils into tracheal and bronchial airways. Granulocyte scores for LTB4-treated groups were 1.9 to 3.3 times higher than those for vehicle-treated groups at 5 min after exposure and 3.3 to 10.7 times higher at 4 h after exposure. Leukotriene B4 itself did not produce hyperinflation. However, histamine-induced gas trapping was increased 5 min after LTB4 exposure. Histamine responsiveness was unaffected 4 h after LTB4 treatment. In contrast, A23187-induced gas trapping was unaffected at 5 min, but diminished at 4 h after LTB4. Nonchemotactic stereoisomers of LTB4 did not produce granulocyte influx, but did produce altered airway responses similar to those seen for LTB4. We conclude that inhaled LTB4 produces airway granulocyte infiltration in the guinea pig and alterations in airway responsiveness that vary with the challenge stimulus and time after exposure. Alterations in airway responses may result from granulocyte-independent effects of LTB4 and its stereoisomers.\r"

  ".W": "To define the relationship between plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) and hemodynamic parameters in patients with chronic pulmonary artery hypertension, we measured plasma concentrations of the peptide in 15 patients during right heart catheterization. Eleven patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 4 had pulmonary vascular disease of diverse etiology. At rest, plasma concentrations of IR-ANP positively correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001), but not with right atrial pressure. Nine of these patients, all with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were also evaluated during exercise. Plasma concentrations of IR-ANP increased from 131 +/- 22 to 191 +/- 30 pg/ml (p less than 0.003) at maximal exercise, whereas pulmonary artery pressure increased from 29 +/- 1.5 to 56 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and right atrial pressure from 5 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg. Increases of plasma IR-ANP concentrations correlated with changes in pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial pressure but not with changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. These findings suggest that ANP is released in response to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and are consistent with the hypothesis that ANP could modulate the pulmonary vascular tone in patients with pulmonary artery hypertension.\r"

Influenza vaccination was the most cost-effective intervention under various simulations in the model but usually allowed for higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared with other alternatives. The combined use of previous vaccination and chemoprophylaxis during outbreaks in the nursing home was associated with significantly fewer cases than use of vaccination alone, with only modest increases in net program costs. The use of chemoprophylaxis throughout the influenza season (without vaccination) resulted in the fewest number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths but would cost at least 650% more than alternatives involving vaccination. Regardless of which strategy is chosen, our model suggests that influenza control programs in nursing homes are both beneficial and cost-effective and should be considered a part of standard care.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with flash-evoked myoclonus were studied electrophysiologically. Myoclonic jerks were elicited at a fixed latency after the application of photic stimuli and were always preceded at a fixed time interval by extremely enhanced cortical evoked potentials. The enhanced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to flash were widely distributed over the scalp and were maximal at the central region; the occipital response preceded the frontocentral response by 3.4 to 5.1 msec. The interval from the frontocentral EEG response to the flash-evoked myoclonus was similar to that from the giant somatosensory evoked potential to the electrically evoked myoclonus. Investigation of recovery of evoked cortical responses and of myoclonic jerks showed a period of extremely enhanced excitability of both central and peripheral phenomena following stimulus. All of these findings suggest a cortical reflex mechanism. The role of the occipital cortex in the pathogenesis of photic cortical reflex myoclonus remains to be elucidated.\r"

These levels and concentrations in urine were several times higher than the MIC for most pathogens that cause chronic bacterial prostatitis and urinary tract infection. The MICs for several isolates of Escherichia coli were only slightly affected by canine prostatic secretion, human prostatic tissue extract, and human urine. Clinical trials with fleroxacin appear justified for chronic bacterial prostatitis and urinary tract infection.\r"

Deptomycin was the most active agent tested, as determined by broth microdilution methods, with all strains being inhibited at concentrations less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. The kill-kinetic demonstrated that deptomycin had greater activity at all concentrations tested than the other cell wall-active agents; regrowth was seen, however, at lower concentrations. At higher concentrations (6X and 8X MIC), all agents tested demonstrated the same or less bactericidal activity than at 4X MIC, presumably due to the Eagle effect. Nevertheless, these results suggest that further evaluation of deptomycin as a therapeutic agent for serious enterococcal infections is warranted.\r"

Hybridization experiments revealed that at least six of seven HincII fragments of Tn916, representing greater than 95% of its length, showed homology with DNA of Tetr C. difficile strains. Therefore, a close relationship of the C. difficile Tetr-determining element with the entire Tn916 transposon can be assumed, although differences were observed concerning the number of HindIII cleavage sites within the transposon. In addition to strong hybridization of Tetr determinants of C. difficile with Tn916, weak signals were detected when DNA of Tets C. difficile was hybridized with Tn916. These weak signals could be attributed to a single internal HincII fragment of Tn916.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used to study the comparative antibacterial activities of multiple-dose regimens of enoxacin and netilmicin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed to changing drug concentrations, mimicking human two-compartment pharmacokinetics. Oral administration was simulated for the quinolone, and intravenous administration was simulated for the aminoglycoside. Similar ratios of peak concentration to MIC resulted in similar changes in bacterial concentrations over time with both compounds. Following the initial dose, a rapid bactericidal effect occurred, with a greater than 99% reduction of the bacterial counts within 4 h at peak concentrations more than three times the MIC. However, bacterial regrowth occurred within 24 h unless the peak concentration/MIC ratio exceeded 8:1 (P less than 0.01). For the regrowing bacteria, MICs were four- to eightfold higher, and little or no bactericidal effect occurred following the second and subsequent doses. These data demonstrate the equally potent bactericidal activity of orally administered enoxacin and intravenously administered netilmicin. Selection of resistant subpopulations was similar with each drug. The peak concentration/MIC ratio may be an important parameter in the clinical use of quinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics.\r"

Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively.

Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although LY146032 at relatively high concentrations inhibited the in vitro polymerization of UDP-linked sugar precursors, inhibition of cell wall formation in intact Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium cells did not lead to the accumulation of UDP-N-acetyl-muramyl (MurNAc)-peptide(s). Experiments that measured formation of UDP-MurNAc-peptides revealed that LY146032 inhibited the formation of these nucleotide-linked intermediates. This antibiotic had a disruptive effect on membrane permeability as evidenced by the loss of intracellular potassium immediately after exposure to the drug. The lack of any major disruption of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system indicated that the membrane is not likely a lethal target for this antibiotic. The findings are consistent with a mechanism by which LY146032 inhibits the formation of precursor molecules utilized in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The observed membrane effects likely result from transit of the inhibitor to its lethal target site.\r"

The Mtr phenotype of N. gonorrhoeae raised the MICs two- to fourfold, but the MICs remained within the range of achievable levels in serum.

Pleural empyema compared with effusion was characterized by lower pH, oxygen tension (PaO2), and glucose levels and higher leukocyte count, lactic acid concentration, and PaCO2. After a single administration, gentamicin was first detectable in the pleural fluid at 60 min, whereas peak levels in empyema were observed at 180 min. Gentamicin persisted in the empyema longer than in blood. Animals treated with gentamicin only had 60% bacterial cure on day 7; those treated with gentamicin in an oxygen chamber had 100% cure on day 5 (P = 0.004). Low oxygen tension diminished the antibacterial efficacy of gentamicin in this model. An increase in oxygen tension improved the therapeutic results without alteration of the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin.\r"

SSS is measured by summing the standard deviation units of change in the septic direction for the 16 measurements taken every day in the intensive care unit. Increasing Vd is tightly associated with an increasing SSS (r = +0.52), after day 10 an increasing bacti. log (r = +0.21 to +0.32), and an increasing AB/d (r = +0.26) (all p less than 0.001, N = 1615 - 1626). The independent variables that best predicted Vd were delayed operations (DORS), day of rising EnP, and total positive blood cultures (TPC) (adj. R sq. = 0.84, F = 104, dF = 3/59). An increasing AB/d was associated with an increasing SSS (r = +0.38), increasing Vd (r = +0.26), and an increased bacti. log (r = +0.14 to +0.18) (all p less than 0.001, N = 1615). Only an increased EnP was consistently associated with a reduced SSS (r = -0.38) and a reduction in bacti. log (r = -0.10 to -0.21) (all p less than 0.001, N = 1626-1636). The independent variables Vd, EnP, AB/d, and TPC best predicted SSS for all surviving patients (adj. R sq. = 0.42, F = 268, dF = 4/1496). The patients who died of sepsis were not different in terms of bacti. log from those with equal Vd but were distinguished by zero EnP, high AB/d, and persistent ventilatory support. In conclusion, DORS is tightly associated with increased Vd, SSS, AB/d, and zero EnP. If Vd exceeds 10, there is an increasing bacti. log and evidence of infection probably from the gut. This responds only to increased EnP and not to AB/d. Death due to sepsis is not associated with increased bacti. log but with zero EnP and high AB/d and their consequences.\r"

Twenty patients with chronic reflux esophagitis (mean duration, 13 years) achieved significant clinical improvement after acute intensive therapy with cimetidine and metoclopramide. During the 26-month follow-up period after remission, nine (45%) patients experienced a relapse of symptoms as drug dosages were tapered or discontinued, eight (40%) patients remained in remission, and three experienced a relapse of symptoms after a remission of longer than two years. Lower esophageal sphincter pressures were lower among patients who relapsed compared with patients with prolonged remission (4.9 vs 13.2 mm Hg). Drug requirements to maintain symptom control were antacids alone in five patients, bedtime H2-blocker in five, full-dose H2-blocker in four, and bedtime metoclopramide (10 mg) plus an H2-blocker in six. Moreover, the symptoms of three patients receiving full-dose H2-blocker therapy were controlled with antacids alone for two years, until relapse occurred. In conclusion, some patients with severe, long-standing reflux esophagitis will have a lasting response to short-term intensive medical therapy. Long-term intensive therapy may be unnecessary in many patients. Patients with lower sphincter pressures may have a higher likelihood of symptomatic relapse.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a community-wide study examining time trends in the incidence and case-fatality rates of 3263 patients hospitalized with validated acute myocardial infarction (MI) during the years 1975, 1978, 1981, and 1984, we examined changes over time in the use of various noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tests during hospitalization for acute MI. In terms of the noninvasive procedures, exercise testing before hospital discharge increased from only 0.1% of patients in 1975 to 40.3% in 1984, while use of echocardiography (2.5%, 1975; 15.3%, 1984), Holter monitoring (1.0%, 1975; 34.0%, 1984), and radionuclide ventriculography (2.6%, 1975; 52.7%, 1984) also increased dramatically. Concerning the invasive procedures, use of coronary arteriography in patients with acute MI increased from 3.1% in 1975 to 9.8% in 1984. A more striking increase was noted in the use of pulmonary artery catheterization (7.2%, 1975; 19.9%, 1984). Examination of patient characteristics associated with the use of these tests demonstrated that the increased use of these diagnostic procedures was not due to changes in the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with acute MI; rather, it was the result of changes in physician practice patterns. If the practice patterns seen in this community-based study are similar to those seen throughout the United States, the charges for these diagnostic tests in 1984 are estimated to approach 600 million dollars. Given current interest in cost-containment and evaluation of clinical practices, these results suggest the need for further observational studies and clinical trials to assess the cost-effectiveness of these diagnostic tests. To assess the cost-effectiveness, it will be necessary to determine if the use of these tests improves the short-term or long-term prognosis of patients hospitalized with acute MI.\r"

Commonly used doses of phenytoin (300 to 500 mg/d) may result in almost undetectable serum levels. Therapeutic phenytoin levels may be obtained if a very large dose of the drug is given. Our patient required 1800 mg daily in two divided doses to get a serum phenytoin level of 9 micrograms/mL. Commonly used enteral feedings were being delivered by way of a continuous infusion pump. We found one enteral feeding product that did not severely impair the absorption of phenytoin. The mechanism by which enteral feedings impair phenytoin absorption is unknown.\r"

Four postmortem eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. Four features of Muller's cell behavior were observed: (1) Muller's cell nuclei migrated within the retina. (2) They were the principal glial cells in preretinal membranes. (3) Muller's cells formed horizontal bands, in the outer retina, that gave the appearance of subretinal membranes. (4) They formed intraretinal bridges between cystic spaces. In conclusion, the Muller's cell (or its progeny) plays an active role in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".U": "88024285\r", 
  ".W": "Gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) is a T cell-derived lymphokine that has potent macrophage-activating properties. It increases Fc receptor density, increases the formation and release of reactive oxygen intermediates, increases the synthesis and release of complement cascade proteins, especially C2 and factor B, and increases class II (HLA-DR) antigen expression. These effects may play a role in the potentiation of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. We examined the possibility that gold sodium thiomalate (GST), an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, would inhibit gamma-IFN-mediated stimulation of monocyte/macrophages. GST in concentrations attainable in vivo was shown to inhibit both spontaneous and gamma-IFN-stimulated C2 production up to 50%. GST inhibition could be only partially overcome with increasing concentrations of gamma-IFN. In addition, GST inhibited gamma-IFN-stimulated HLA-DR expression at the highest concentrations tested (20-50 micrograms/ml). GST alone in low concentrations (0.1-5 micrograms/ml) was found to increase HLA-DR antigen expression as quantitated by several methods, including flow cytometry, cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting. This GST-stimulated increase in HLA-DR antigen expression paralleled an increased ability of monocytes to present antigen. The mechanism by which low concentrations of GST stimulate HLA-DR antigen expression is unclear, but was shown by 35S-methionine cell labeling not to involve increased HLA-DR protein synthesis.\r"

Similar experiments using normal and macroglobulinemic blood samples were done in which the macroglobulinemic plasma was replaced by normal saline, and there was no difference in the half-lives. Therefore, we believe the plasma phase played a significant role as a barrier to carbon monoxide transfer in this patient. The mechanism of this impairment is unclear at this time. Nonetheless, impaired carbon monoxide transfer in plasma has not been noted before and potentially has both diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which ovarian electrocautery induces regular ovulatory cycles was studied in 16 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) and compared with 25 normal fertile women who were undergoing sterilization by tubal electrocautery. Gonadotrophins (LH and FSH), prolactin, androgens, oestrogens, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone were determined immediately before operation and 24 h later. Following the sampling of blood for these tests, 100 micrograms of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was given intravenously and the LH and FSH responses were measured at 30 min. In the PCO-group, these tests were repeated after the first induced ovulatory cycle. After operation, LH increased only in the patients with PCO and this increase was associated with an enhanced response to GnRH, FSH showed a similar response to GnRH, also confined to the PCO-group. These pituitary responses are best explained by a change in ovarian feedback induced by the direct electrocautery of the glands in the PCO-group. There was little change in serum oestrogen. Prolactin showed an increment in all cases and serum androgens were reduced in all groups, most pronounced in the PCO patients, possibly as a result of the stress of operation. An ovarian factor--released or reduced by the electrocautery--seems to be responsible for the changes.\r"

Cells were incubated with and without arachidonic acid and PGE was estimated by specific radioimmunoassay.

Values in the elective section and induction groups were 13.6 (SEM 2.7) and 10 (SEM 3.1), respectively; these values were significantly higher than in the preterm labour group and the values after induction were significantly lower than after spontaneous labour. Addition of arachidonic acid resulted in a significant increase in PGE output in all groups, but the values after preterm labour remained significantly lower than those of any group at term. These data indicate that towards term there is a maturation in the PG synthetase activity of the amnion and that PGE output in this tissue is increased in spontaneous labour.\r"

A group of ALL cells whose cell surface phenotype was CD2 (SRBC receptor) negative and CD7 (T cell antigen) positive has been considered as precursor thymocyte ALL (pre-T-ALL). No rearrangements of the T cell receptor beta-gene (TCR beta) and gamma-gene (TCR gamma) were found in three of four pre-T-ALL patients. Stimulation of these pre-T-ALL cells with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced only CD25 (Tac) antigen but no other T cell antigens. These findings suggest that the activation pathway of interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor already exists in the most immature precursor thymocytes. Pre-T-ALL cells from the fourth patients showed the expression of CD3 antigen, and both TCR beta and TCR gamma rearrangement. TPA induced the differentiation of the more mature pre-T-ALL cells of this case in vitro, and not only CD25 (Tac) antigen but also CD4 and CD8 antigens appeared on the cell surface. The low affinity binding of 125I-IL-2 to TPA-stimulated leukemia cells was observed in the three cases of pre-T-ALL tested, and the addition of recombinant IL-2 to TPA-stimulated cells showed no effect on cell proliferation.\r"

In the assessment of class II antigens, HLA-DR was expressed on all B lineage cells whereas HLA-DP preceded HLA-DQ in appearance during the developmental process. Among the later antigens expressed on B lineage cells, cell surface IgM, CD20, and HLA-DQ were expressed at essentially the same time. Cell surface CD10 was lost at the time when CD21 and CD22 were acquired on the cell surface. These data illustrate that multiparameter flow cytometry can be used to define a continuous progression of stages of B lymphocyte development based on cell surface antigen expression even though these cells represent a minor fraction of normal marrow cells.\r"

Twenty-five patients with ATL were examined to determine whether their leukemic cells continued to show IL-2-dependent proliferation. In 21 patients, the in vitro proliferation of HTLV-I-infected nonleukemic T cell clones was found to be dependent on IL-2. However, clonality analysis based on T cell receptor gene rearrangement profiles and the site of HTLV-I provirus integration revealed IL-2-dependent growth in leukemic cells in four patients with ATL. These results provide evidence for the IL-2-dependent proliferation of leukemic cells in some ATL patients.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we provide evidence that the sera of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) contain a factor that can prevent the binding of a monoclonal antibody specific for interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) to its target. This factor corresponds to the soluble form of IL-2R (sIL-2R), as assessed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, and appears to be released by neoplastic hairy cells. The serum sIL-2R levels were very high at diagnosis and significantly reduced during recombinant alpha-interferon (rIFN alpha 2) therapy. Values of sIL-2R appeared to be inversely related to the natural killer in vitro function displayed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same patients. The presence of sIL-2R in the serum of patients with HCL might be involved in the impairment of cell-mediated immunity observed in these patients and could represent a valuable marker for monitoring different phases of the disease and for modulating IFN therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL, n = 13), B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL, n = 2) or hairy cell leukemia (n = 1) were incubated in the presence of the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the calcium ionophore A23187. A synergy between these inducers was found with respect to morphological changes and B cell proliferation and differentiation. A23187 used alone did not activate the cells. B-CLL cells treated with the double stimulus acquired a plasmacytoid morphology, showed significantly higher incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine, and produced significantly higher amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulin compared with the same cells exposed to either of the inducers alone. These results indicate that phorbol ester and calcium ionophore act synergistically on B-CLL cells to induce proliferation and differentiation. B-PLL cells responded more vigorously to the signals provided by TPA and A23187. Previous studies showed that TPA and A23187 can mimic the two physiological second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate in the transduction of signals leading to cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation in normal B cells. The present findings suggest that the capacity of B-CLL and B-PLL cells to differentiate in response to signals of the second messenger pathway is intact.\r"

Southern blot analysis with antibody probes demonstrated clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in PBLs of seven of nine patients that were identical to those seen in their marrow plasma cells. Circulating plasma cells were not detected in any of these patients. In contrast, no patient demonstrated clonally rearranged T cell receptor genes. In one sequentially studied patient, PBLs obtained at diagnosis when he had stage I (Durie-Salmon) contained only germline DNA, while analysis of PBLs at relapse (stage III) revealed a clonally rearranged band. These data confirm the notion that circulating lymphocytes in patients with myeloma are part of the malignant clone and, furthermore, these malignant cells are of B cell rather than T cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "U937 cells respond to a variety of stimuli with increased differentiation as manifested by reduced growth, increased adherence, increased expression of several surface receptors, and increased capacity for phagocytosis and formation of reactive oxygen intermediates. In the present study the effects of lymphocyte conditioned media, recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on the ability to form reactive oxygen intermediates by U937 cells were measured by using the luminol-dependent luminescence (LDL) assay. Neither 1,25(OH)2D3 alone nor IFN-gamma alone enhanced competence for phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated LDL. Cells were capable of moderate LDL after exposure to lymphocyte conditioned media, and this was enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-8) mol/L) and other vitamin D metabolites at higher concentrations. This effect was not secondary to accelerated production of myeloperoxidase, which is important in the LDL assay. Enhanced phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated phosphorylation of a 48-kd substrate was observed in 32P-labeled intact cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 alone or in combination with IFN-gamma. Treatment of cells with IFN-gamma or lymphocyte conditioned media did not alter phosphorylation. These results support the concept that 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a role in phagocyte differentiation and activation beyond the effects of lymphokines. Protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation reactions may be necessary for the ability of U937 cells to reduce O2 and required for maximal activity under some conditions of incubation.\r"

To this end PAI-1 was purified from cortisol-stimulated HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells and antisera raised in rabbits. The immunologic relationship of the purified inhibitor to PAI-1 in plasma and platelet extracts was established by immunoblotting and regular and reverse fibrin zymography. Furthermore, the purified product could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to human or bovine endothelial cell-derived PAI-1. A radioimmunoassay was developed that measures both free and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-bound PAI-1 in plasma and has an effective range of 8 to 250 ng/mL. PAI-1 antigen levels showed a twofold increase after 20 minutes of venous occlusion, partially due to hemoconcentration. Approximately one quarter of PAI-1 before and after venous occlusion is derived from platelets. After correction for hemoconcentration and the contribution of platelets to plasma PAI-1 levels, a still significant increase in PAI-1 levels was noted during venous occlusion, which suggests that the local vascular bed releases PAI-1. Concomitant with PAI-1, t-PA antigen levels increased eightfold and fibrinolytic activity 18-fold after 20 minutes of venous occlusion. PAI-1 and t-PA levels tend to augment with age: in a group of older healthy volunteers (mean age, 53 years) PAI-1 levels were twice and t-PA levels 1.7 times higher than those in a group with a mean age of 29 years. Determination of PAI-1 antigen levels before and after platelet aggregation demonstrated that 85% of PAI-1 in platelet-rich plasma is associated with platelets. The average amount of PAI-1 per platelet was 0.3 fg/platelet, ie, 4,000 molecules per platelet.\r"

Bound F.VIII was estimated in situ by clotting and chromogenic assays. F.VIII bound in a dose-dependent manner to immobilized vWF and SpIII but not to SpII or SpI. Binding was inhibited by 0.25 mol/L CaCl2 as well as by an excess of vWF or SpIII. Accordingly, immobilized F.VIII specifically bound 125I-vWF and SpIII but not SpII or SpI. Twelve monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed towards SpIII, specifically blocking binding of F.VIII to vWF or SpIII, were used for the mapping of plasmic or tryptic fragments of vWF or SpIII. We thus established that a F.VIII binding domain of vWF is located on a 34 kilodalton (kd) fragment of the N-terminal portion of vWF, between residues 1 and 910, and that it is distinct from the GPIb and collagen binding domains.\r"

Twenty-five patients were treated with D-penicillamine (DPA) and 20 patients with gold (sodium aurothiomalate). The level of circulating complex was reduced by both treatments (p less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the circulating levels of IgA-alpha 1AT complex and serum IgA (p less than 0.05). No relationship was observed between the level of circulating complex and CRP. These findings suggest that formation of IgA-alpha 1AT complex in RA is dependent on the level of IgA. The complex is reduced by gold and DPA but it does not reflect an acute phase response as measured by CRP.\r"

In addition to basic dosimetric measurements made using an ionisation chamber and film densitometry to quantify the output and dose distribution from the applicator, extensive use was made of thermoluminescent dosemeters and a tissue-equivalent anthropomorphic head phantom. This was designed for detailed dosimetry on the eye and was used to confirm the correct positioning and reproducibility of the clinical set-up. We present data that corroborate and extend the dosimetric analyses documented in an earlier Dutch publication. In addition to the improved dosimetric analysis, other advantages include patient immobilisation, anaesthetic procedure and finer couch control as well as a recommendation on the dose prescription.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of therapy on the osteolytic bone lesions of Paget's disease have been assessed from serial bone radiographs. Changes in the rate of progression of lytic \"wedge\" lesions were measured and alterations in the texture of lytic \"blade\" lesions were graded on an empirical scale. Useful matching was possible using standard radiographs, although special care was needed to avoid artefacts from suboptimal positioning, magnification and variation in exposure. Serial radiographs were obtained of 57 lytic blade lesions in 54 patients receiving treatment with the bisphosphonate 1-hydroxyethylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonate (EHDP) and of 20 lesions in 20 patients treated with oral or intravenous 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonate (APD). Treatment with EHDP was associated with a significant deterioration in bone texture in 50% of lytic blade lesions, and with healing in only 20%. Deterioration was accompanied by an increase in local bone pain in 17% of these patients. In contrast, significant healing was observed in 17 of 20 lytic lesions (eight wedge, nine blade) within 6 months of beginning a course of intravenous or oral APD. In four of eight patients the progression of a lytic tibial wedge was arrested and in the remaining four the direction of wedge movement was reversed. In two patients the wedge had almost completely \"filled in\", making measurement difficult. Bone healing was usually accompanied by pain relief, reduction in skin temperature and rapid suppression of the urine hydroxyproline (uHP) into the normal range. However, in four patients who received intravenous APD, repair of lytic bone lesions was observed despite persisting elevation of uHP. These improvements with APD were sustained at 12 months, although in one patient whose biochemical indices were restored to normal the resorption front showed further progression, despite initial temporary reversal. The trends apparent in these short-term studies were also seen in four patients in whom wedge velocities were measured over periods of 6-10 years. These results confirm that after treatment of Paget's disease, bone healing or deterioration can be accurately assessed from serial standard radiographs. Reproducible matching is best achieved by ensuring that all radiographs are taken by the same radiographer. Minor alterations in radiological bone texture provide an important index of drug effect which is not always apparent from measurement of biochemical and other indices.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral blood flow, estimated by the xenon clearance technique, has been used to study eight patients before and after extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery. Response of cerebral blood flow to hypercapnia was also measured to estimate cerebral reactivity, an indicator of cerebral vasodilator reserve capacity. Measurements in all patients were repeated 3 months after surgery. Resting cerebral blood flow was not increased by the operation but cerebral reactivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly increased in all patients (P = 0.002). Reactivity also increased in the contralateral hemisphere in six of the eight patients (P = 0.065). The response of cerebral blood flow to hypercapnia may prove useful in the selection of symptomatic patients with carotid occlusions or inaccessible stenoses for revascularization by EC-IC bypass.\r"

Wound infection was less common with PDX (PDX 3.5 per cent; PPL 7.0 per cent; P less than 0.05) and there was one dehiscence in each group. The incidence of defective wounds in patients surviving 1 year was similar (7.7 per cent PDX; 9.7 per cent PPL) but the PPL suture had to be removed because of persisting wound pain or sinus formation in five patients. PDX is the preferred suture material for closure of midline abdominal incisions.\r"

The age standardised prevalence of gout in Tokelauan men in New Zealand was higher than that in non-migrant Tokelauan men, being 21.0 and 19.5/1000 subjects at the beginning of the study and 51.0 and 14.6/1000 at the end of study, respectively. Migrant men in New Zealand aged under 55 had higher mean serum uric acid concentrations than non-migrant men of the same age. The prevalence of gout was low in women in both environments. The age standardised relative risk of developing gout between 1968 and 1982 was 9.0 times higher in the migrant men than in the non-migrant men. Age, serum uric acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, and self reported alcohol consumption at entry to the study were the best set of predictors of gout in men. Preventive strategies to change body mass, diet, and patterns of alcohol use need to be developed in this population.\r"

In women given danazol the number of biopsy specimens that were positive for progesterone receptors rose from 14 out of 31 before treatment to 23 out of 30 at the end of six months' treatment and remained raised at 21 out of 31 six months later. The number of biopsy specimens that were positive for oestrogen receptors rose transiently from eight out of 31 to 12 out of 30 and then fell to six out of 31. A satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 26 of the 31 patients but was maintained in only 11 six months or more after the end of treatment. It was only in this group that a significant and long-standing increase in progesterone receptors was observed. These findings suggest that in some women with benign breast disease who have been treated with danazol changes occur that may have long term benefit.\r"

A further 76 patients had refused the study, giving an overall drop out rate of 3.6%. Several methods were combined so as to detect as many patients with problem drinking as possible. According to the criteria and definitions employed 17% of men (confidence interval 15% to 19%) and 4% of women (confidence interval 3% to 5%) were excessive consumers of alcohol or problem drinkers. The highest proportion of such patients--that is, 17%--was noted in the emergency rooms (27% of men, 8% of women). At other clinics the proportions varied from 11% to 17% of men and from 2% to 4% of women. The strongest relations between overconsumption of alcohol and consultation at the clinic were among patients attending the medical outpatient clinic and the emergency rooms; in 86% (confidence interval 75% to 97%) and 88% (confidence interval 81% to 95%) of problem drinkers attending these clinics, respectively, alcohol was related to the consultation. Consultations were related to alcohol in 82% of women with excessive or problem drinking and 73% of men defined in this way. There was a tendency to a higher proportion of men with excessive or problem drinking in the age group 40-49 years. These findings show that among patients classified as excessive or problem drinkers attending somatic outpatient clinics there was a close relation between alcohol consumption and utilisation of medical resources, especially in women.\r"

This variation was not seen in the control group. The number of prescriptions received per visit was static in both groups at all times. General practitioners should regard more frequent attendance by patients who already attend often as indicating that those patients are at risk of parasuicide.\r"

The results of research indicate that insulin dependent diabetes can be produced in animal models by environmental factors, there are major geographical variations in diabetes, certain populations have shown rapid changes in incidence over time, migrants appear to take on the risk of diabetes in their new country, and certain viruses and chemicals cause insulin dependent diabetes in humans. The results of genetic and epidemiological studies also show that at least 60% of insulin dependent diabetes world wide, and perhaps over 95%, is environmentally determined and thus potentially avoidable. It is concluded that the primary worldwide determinants of diabetes are environmental not immunogenetic and that identifying and altering the diabetogenic environmental factor(s) are likely to be more effective and less risky in preventing insulin dependent diabetes than current immunogenetic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial pressure is raised early in the subset of insulin dependent diabetics at risk of later development of progressive renal failure, suggesting that liability to arterial hypertension may play a part in the aetiology of diabetic kidney disease. Evidence for a genetic basis was therefore sought by measuring the blood pressures of the 26 surviving parents of 17 insulin dependent diabetic patients with proteinuria and comparing them with those of the parents of 17 matched insulin dependent diabetic patients without proteinuria selected from the same cohort. Systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly higher in parents of the proteinuric (mean (SD) 161 (27)/94 (14) mm Hg) than in parents of the non-proteinuric patients (146 (21)/86 (11) mm Hg). The difference between the sample mean blood pressures was 15 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 3.3 to 26.7 mm Hg) for systolic pressure and 8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 15.2 mm Hg) for diastolic pressure. These differences were independent of age, sex, and adiposity. There was a significant correlation between the mean arterial pressures in the proteinuric patients and the higher mean blood pressure in their parents. High blood pressure in non-diabetic parents may be a marker of susceptibility to clinical nephropathy in their insulin dependent diabetic offspring.\r"

Mean serum cholesterol concentration (n = 33) fell by 12% from 6.54 (SE 0.18) to 5.76 (0.15) mmol/l (mean fall 0.78 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.04 mmol/l), serum triglyceride concentration (n = 33) by 22% from 1.56 (0.17) to 1.21 (0.09) mmol/l (mean fall 0.34 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.56 mmol/l), and mean blood pressure (n = 27) by 10% from 102 (2) to 92 (2) mm Hg (mean fall 10 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval 7 to 13 mm Hg). These changes were not explained by changes in body composition. Peak exercise left ventricular end diastolic volume (n = 16) increased with training; as a result of this and an increased exercise left ventricular ejection fraction peak exercise cardiac output increased from 19.9 (1.2) to 23.1 (3.0) l/min (mean rise 3.2 l/min; 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 5.0 l/min). Maximum oxygen consumption increased from 33.9 (1.6) to 39.0 (1.3) ml/kg/min (mean rise 5.0 ml/kg/min; 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 8.2 ml/kg/min). This study showed favourable effects on coronary risk factors and cardiac function and supports the place of regular exercise in coronary prevention programmes.\r"

The mental health of 954 unemployed men registered at 41 unemployment benefit offices in England and Wales was assessed by the general health questionnaire, men in areas of particularly high unemployment being compared with men in areas of moderate and relatively low unemployment. Scores for ill health were significantly lower in areas of particularly high unemployment, even when personal factors known to affect mental health during unemployment were controlled for. These results support the hypothesis that communities with high rates of unemployment develop resilience that is beneficial for the mental health of the unemployed.\r"

Two patients were only transiently positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. The outbreak was controlled by vigorous contact tracing and counselling. Despite an enormous increase in workload for the general practitioner and problems including disposal of contaminated needles, outbreaks of hepatitis B virus infection may adequately be treated in the community.\r"

Nearly a fifth of the subjects reported occasional or frequent bouts of heavy drinking, a quarter took drugs for physical illness, and a few took drugs for recreation. Those who were emotionally distressed at the initial study and the follow up were more empathetic and more self critical than those who had low levels of stress on both occasions. Overwork was the most stressful aspect of their jobs, though the number of hours worked was not related to stress levels, unlike diet and sleep. The more stressed they were the more unfavourably they viewed aspects of their jobs. The incidence of distress is unacceptably high in junior house officers, and both they and the hospitals need to deal with the causes of the distress.\r"

Results were correlated with clinical outcome and CD4 T lymphocyte count. Both antigenaemia and the disappearance of antibodies to the core protein were associated with development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS related complex and depletion of CD4 cells. Thus AIDS or AIDS related complex developed in eight out of 16 patients with antigenaemia compared with one out of 18 patients without antigenaemia. Low counts of CD4 cells (less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l) were found in 14 of the 16 patients with antigenaemia and five of the 18 without antigenaemia. Nine patients seroconverted to HIV during the study; two of these developed antigenaemia 14 and 16 months after the estimated time of seroconversion. These results show that the late stages of HIV infection are characterised by increased production of antigen and a decrease in antibodies directed against the core protein. Antigenaemia indicates a poor prognosis; and as the antigen test is simple to do and interpret, it may therefore be useful for selecting patients for antiviral treatment.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and ninety eight men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and 58 HIV antibody seroconverters were studied for an average of 19.3 (SEM 0.5) months to assess the relation between HIV antigenaemia and the risk of developing the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS related complex. Forty (20.2%) of the 198 HIV antibody seropositive men were antigen positive at entry and remained so during follow up. Eight (13.8%) of the 58 HIV antibody seroconverters and 20 (12.7%) of the remaining 158 HIV antibody seropositive men became antigen positive during follow up, resulting in an end point attack rate for HIV antigenaemia of 14.3%. AIDS related complex was diagnosed in 25 (15.8%) of the HIV antigen negative men and in 14 (20.7%) of the HIV antigen positive men. AIDS was diagnosed in 15 men, resulting in an end point attack rate for AIDS of 23.9% in the HIV antigen positive group and 1.3% in the antigen negative group. HIV antibody seropositive men without symptoms but with persistent HIV antigenaemia are at increased risk of developing AIDS and AIDS related complex.\r"

  ".U": "88026202\r", 
  ".W": "The growth of 26 short normal prepubertal children (mean age 8.4, height velocity standard deviation score for chronological age between +0.4 and -0.8) was studied for two years. Sixteen children were treated with somatrem (methionyl growth hormone) during the second year, and the remaining 10 children served as controls. During one year of treatment the height velocity standard deviation score for chronological age increased from the pretreatment mean of -0.44 (SD 0.33) to +2.20 (1.03). These values represented a change in height velocity from a pretreatment mean of 5.3 cm/year (range 4.6-6.9) to 7.4 cm/year (range 5.7-9.9). In the control group the height velocity standard deviation score was unchanged. Bone age advanced by 0.75 (0.33) years in the treated group compared with 0.70 (0.18) years in the control group. There was a significant increase in the height standard deviation score for bone age (0.63 (0.55] in the treated group. Multiple regression analysis of predictive factors contributing to the change in height velocity standard deviation score over the first year of treatment showed that the dose of growth hormone and pretreatment height velocity standard deviation score were important, together yielding a regression correlation coefficient of 0.80. The only metabolic side effect of treatment was an increase in fasting insulin concentration, which may be an important mediator of the anabolic effects of growth hormone. Treatment had no effect on thyroid function, blood pressure, or glucose tolerance. At the end of the treatment year seven of the 16 treated children had developed antibodies to growth hormone, but they were present in low titre with low binding capacity and in no child was growth attenuated. Biosynthetic growth hormone improved the height velocity of children growing along or parallel to the third height centile, but the effects on height prognosis need to be assessed over a longer period.\r"

A total of 1290 (90%) returned completed questionnaires. These showed widely varying views about the prognostic importance of particular symptoms and physical signs and about elements of management. Although 96% of the respondents prescribed bed rest more or less routinely for heavy bleeding in early pregnancy, only 17% felt it was mandatory, and 32% admitted that they did not believe it affected the outcome. Of the 13% of respondents who prescribed progestogens for threatened miscarriage, most did so on the advice of their local obstetrician. Seventeen per cent of the doctors always admitted women with apparently complete miscarriages to hospital. Twenty nine per cent of the respondents never gave anti-D immunoglobulin to rhesus negative women after a complete miscarriage. Bleeding in early pregnancy is a common problem and more research is required to improve management, particularly the assessment of fetal viability.\r"

Behavioural treatment (exposure) and antidepressants are the most helpful approaches. Most patients can help themselves if they use a self exposure approach systematically under the guidance of a clinician. The method seems well suited for use by general practitioners. Anti-depressants are a useful adjuvant, not a substitute, for exposure when there is evidence of depression complicating the phobias or rituals.\r"
