One hundred ninety-six consecutive patients admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of dyspnea were randomized to receive or not receive an echocardiogram within 24 hours of admission. Most patients randomized to echo and control groups had cardiac or pulmonary disease and were comparable in their other clinical characteristics. Predefined study end points included the following: change in diagnosis or treatment; performance of additional diagnostic cardiopulmonary studies; and duration of hospitalization (the principal end point). Changes in diagnosis or treatment during hospitalization were as infrequent among patients randomized to echo as among control patients. Echocardiography independently confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 72 percent of echo-randomized patients. Even when echo findings conflicted with the clinical diagnosis, the diagnosis and management plan rarely changed. Additional cardiac or pulmonary studies were ordered as frequently among patients randomized to echocardiography as among those randomized to control. The mean duration of hospital stay also did not differ between the two groups, and no clinical parameter served to predict which subgroup of patients might benefit from echocardiography. Although echocardiography can be expeditiously obtained during respiratory exacerbations of cardiopulmonary disease, indiscriminate echo does not necessarily hasten or alter the treatment of such patients.\r"

Our results support the concept that S aureus pulmonary infections usually occur in older adults (sixth decade or older) with concomitant illnesses that are typically nosocomial. However, in contrast to previous reports, the chest roentgenograms in these patients typically showed multilobar infiltrates (60 percent), predominantly in the lower lobes (64 percent), and often bilateral (48 percent). Pleural involvement (48 percent) was more common than previously reported, and abscess formation (16 percent) occurred infrequently. Sputum cultures were found to be sensitive but nonspecific diagnostic tools. Despite antibiotic therapy, reinfection occurred in 10 percent of patients and the mortality rate was 32 percent.\r"

At peak exercise, six subjects had supraventricular arrhythmias while 24 had VAs. Univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression did not show relationships between exercise-related cardiac arrhythmias and the severity of pulmonary disease, oxyhemoglobin desaturation or ECG evidence of chronic lung disease. Exercise-related arrhythmias were significantly associated with the presence of arrhythmias at rest and 87 percent of subjects who had no arrhythmias at rest did not have any during exercise. In patients with COPD, the development of potentially serious arrhythmias during exercise is uncommon without clinically apparent CAD or arrhythmias at rest. However, routine cardiac monitoring during exercise testing should not be abandoned in this population since VAs can occur despite their absence at rest.\r"

The design was a prospective cross-sectional survey. Men were evaluated by standardized interviews using a questionnaire. Where indicated, skin testing with PPD, collection of sputum for smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli, and chest x-ray films were performed. The setting was an on-site clinic at a men's shelter in New York City. The patients were men attending the clinic for physical examinations for the work program or requesting evaluation of various medical problems. A total of 1,853 men were evaluated over a 73-month period. The overall rate of infection was 42.8 percent, including 27.0 percent with a positive PPD test, 9.8 percent with a history of a positive PPD test, and 6.0 percent with active tuberculosis. Increasing age, length of stay in the shelter system, black race, and intravenous drug use were found to be independently associated with tuberculous infection. Age, length of stay in the shelter system, and intravenous drug use were independently associated with active tuberculosis. We achieved a compliance rate of 36 percent completing treatment and 13 percent receiving treatment at the conclusion of the study.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effects of smoke inhalation have been little studied. This study evaluated whether firefighters experience a significant change in spirometric values following exposure to smoke from a fire. Sixty firefighters from the city of Pittsburgh completed a questionnaire (Medical Research Council) and underwent spirometric testing following exposure to house fires. The group contained 25 current smokers, 14 ever smokers, and 21 never smokers. Firefighters reporting cough, phlegm, breathlessness, and chest illnesses were more likely to be current or ever smokers than never smokers. Mean spirometric data obtained before exposure, after a minimum of four off-duty days, showed the following: FVC, 4.50 +/- 0.60L (90 percent of predicted); FEV1, 3.65 +/- 0.56L (96 percent of predicted); FEV1/FVC, 81 +/- 8 percent (106 percent of predicted); FEF25-75%, 3.71 +/- 1.13L/s (96 percent of predicted); and PEF, 7.95 +/- 1.70L/s (87 percent of predicted). After exposure, spirometry was performed on 22 firefighters. All spirometric values decreased after exposure; however, a significant decline was only seen in two indices, the FEV1 and FEF25-75%. This decline was small (3 to 11 percent). Two firefighters experienced an exaggerated decline in spirometric values after exposure, compared to the group as a whole. Neither age, smoking history, location of firefighting, intensity of smoke exposure, or use of a self-contained breathing apparatus explained the reasons for the greater decline in these two individuals. Thus, while firefighters do experience a small decrease in pulmonary function after exposure to house fires, there appears to be a small subgroup of firefighters who develop more substantial and potentially clinically important decreases in pulmonary function after smoke exposure.\r"

Trials were performed during isocapnic progressive hypoxia (SaO2 range, 99 to 70 percent) in 22 white and six black subjects. Comparisons between values of SaO2 by oximetry were analyzed by comparing the difference of values by the two methods against their mean. The difference between pulse oximeters and the HP was 2.6 +/- 10.3 percent in all subjects. Results in whites were 1.9 +/- 10.2 percent and in blacks were 5.1 +/- 9.2 percent. The distribution of differences between pulse oximeters and the HP were larger below 80 percent than above 85 percent. We conclude that pulse oximeters give higher values than the HP, a tendency which is more pronounced in black than in white subjects. While the limits of agreement are better at saturations above 85 percent, the 95 percent confidence limits of agreement between pulse oximeters and the HP are rather large (+/- 10 percent) and unacceptable for assuming that pulse oximeters will provide the same values as found in clinical studies using the HP.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty previously healthy individuals were accidentally exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas in 1975. Pulmonary function tests were performed on these individuals on several occasions over the next 12 years. On average, each subject was followed up for 8.5 years and 13 of the 20 exposed persons were tested 12 years following the exposure. Pulmonary function tests obtained one day following the accident were most notable for the high prevalence of airflow obstruction and air trapping. Over the ensuing years, the airflow obstruction persisted; however, the high prevalence of air trapping resolved. Of note, the prevalence of a low residual volume consistently increased during the follow-up period (p less than 0.001) and at year 12, 67 percent of those tested had residual volumes below 80 percent of their predicted value. We also found that five of 13 subjects tested at year 12 had an increase in airway reactivity (greater than 15 percent decline in FEV1) to inhaled methacholine. Those individuals with reactive airways were older (p = 0.004) and had more marked airflow obstruction (p = 0.03) and air trapping (p = 0.03) immediately following the exposure. These data suggest that exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas may result in long-term pulmonary complications that are characterized by a reduced residual volume. Unfortunately, these data preclude us from determining whether the chlorine exposure led to the development of airway reactivity or the presence of reactive airways accounted for the air trapping that was observed following the exposure to chlorine gas.\r"

  ".W": "We wondered if the inverse changes in airway conductance (Gaw) and functional residual capacity (FRC) during histamine (H) and acetylcholine (ACH) challenge are interrelated or occur at random. In 14 normal and 14 asthmatic subjects, we determined FRC and Gaw changes corresponding to changes in specific airway conductance (SGaw) around -40 percent produced by an aerosol of H or ACH inhaled quantitatively and with measured lung deposition. We also assessed the elastic recoil following H inhalation (5A). We found that in 11 normal and nine asthmatic subjects, after H or nine normal and 11 asthmatic subjects after ACH, Gaw and 1/FRC were linearly and directly related (p less than 0.05). The steepness of this slope was directly related to the resting Gaw values. A similar relation was uncovered in the literature for asthmatic patients at rest or during recovery from natural asthma. As the elastic recoil was normal and did not change after H, it could not explain delta FRC at delta SGaw of -40 percent. In conclusion: (1) during H or ACH challenge, Gaw-FRC relationship in normal or asthmatic subjects tends to be hyperbolic and dependent on resting Gaw; (2) such a relationship is seemingly present in other bronchoconstrictor responses with a different pathogenesis; and (3) during bronchoconstriction, as Gaw vs FRC is no longer linear, SGaw becomes volume dependent.\r"

We performed pulmonary function testing and CT scans on all subjects. The ES was assessed by a visual scoring system on CT scans. Between nonsmokers and smokers, there was a significant difference in the ES (p less than 0.05), but not in the FEV1, TLC, and Dsb/VA (expressed as percent predicted values). The ES was 2.3 +/- 4.7 percent (mean +/- SD) in nonsmoking subjects and 13.7 +/- 16.7 percent in smoking subjects. In all subjects the ES showed significant correlations with Dsb/VA (p less than 0.001) and pack-years of cigarette consumption (p less than 0.001) but did not show correlations with FEV1 and with TLC. We concluded that emphysema can occur in smoking asthmatic subjects because of the effect of cigarette smoking, and CT scans are useful for detecting this emphysematous change.\r"

In contrast to experimental models of apneusis, these patients appeared to have intact vagal function and no evidence of pontine disease. However, all our patients displayed clinical, structural, and electrophysiologic features of cervicomedullary compression, a well-recognized complication of achondroplasia. The degree of apneustic breathing was reduced in the majority of our patients following decompressive surgery. Traditional theories on the pathogenesis of apneustic breathing cannot satisfactorily explain the presence of apneustic breathing in our patients. We suggest that cervicomedullary compression may be capable of producing apneustic breathing in the absence of vagal or pneumotaxic center lesions.\r"

RHY, HR and CSNRT were compared in distinguishing between persistent (9 of 42 patients) and transient (11 of 42) SN dysfunction. Persistent SN dysfunction was distinguished by a significantly lower HR (day 14: 46.2 +/- 12 vs 67 +/- 19 bpm; day 21: 40.3 +/- 21 vs 70.8 +/- 16 bpm; p less than 0.05, respectively) and by RHY: postoperative AS (3 of 42) was found only in patients whose SN dysfunction persisted while patients with SR but prolonged CSNRT more often had transient impairment (6 of 42 vs 2 of 42); CSNRT, in contrast, is unlikely to be useful in distinguishing between transient and persistent SN dysfunction since exceptionally long CSNRTs (11,340 ms. 12,080 ms) occurred in patients with both types. Ischemic times were significantly longer in patients with transient impairment when compared with the group with normal SN function (155.1 +/- 36 vs 109.2 +/- 36 min, p less than 0.05) but did not differ significantly in patients with persistent SN dysfunction (124.8 +/- 32 min). Thus, (1) SN dysfunction after cardiac transplantation is common but most often transient; (2) RHY and HR are adequate follow-up parameters and best predictors of long-term SN function; (3) SN dysfunction after transplantation has important clinical implications given the unreliability of lower pacemakers to take over in 3 patients; (4) transient SN dysfunction is related to duration of ischemia during hypothermic preservation whereas pathogenesis of persistent SN dysfunction remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the associations of a bimodal P-wave in ECG lead V1 to cardiac structure and function in healthy normotensive adolescents. Two-dimensional-guided M-mode echocardiography, 12-lead ECG, and conventional and 2-hour averaged automated blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained in 40 normotensive (conventional BP less than 140/90 mm Hg) adolescents (mean age, 13 +/- 1 years). Compared with subjects with simple unimodal P-waves (n = 18), those with a normal yet bimodal P-wave in lead V1 (n = 22) had higher two-hour averaged systolic BP (108 +/- 12 mm Hg vs 99 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and conventional sphygmomanometer systolic BP (110 +/- 11 mm Hg vs 103 +/- 10 mm Hg, p = 0.05). Structurally, the bimodal P-wave group had greater left ventricular mass (174 +/- 40 g vs 144 +/- 26 g, p less than 0.01), and functionally, they had a greater stroke volume (68 +/- 15 ml vs 57 +/- 13 ml, p less than 0.05) than the unimodal P-wave group. In the group with bimodal P-waves, left atrial size was directly related to left ventricular mass (r = 0.63). By step-wise multiple linear regression analysis, this correlation coefficient increased to 0.74 with inclusion of heart rate and to 0.82 with inclusion of systolic BP. Although left atrial size was similar in the unimodal and bimodal P-wave groups, it was unrelated to any parameter in the unimodal P-wave group. Thus, a bimodal P-wave in lead V1, while generally considered a normal variant, is associated with slightly higher systolic BP, significantly greater left ventricular mass, and greater stroke volume. Additionally, a bimodal P-wave in V1 is predictive of the parameters that influence left atrial size, especially left ventricular mass. While all of these findings fall within the traditionally defined normal ranges, the existence of a bimodal P-wave might identify young individuals who are vulnerable to early cardiovascular manifestations of hypertension.\r"

Six patients presented with alveolar hemorrhagic syndrome. Four patients had a pleural exudate rich in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The WG was limited to the lung in seven patients. Sixteen patients died because of active disease or iatrogenic complications (two). An improved knowledge of clinical and imaging features of WG could help the clinician reach an earlier diagnosis.\r"

A right lateral thoracotomy was performed to resect the unstable segment and improve maximal expiratory flow. Diffuse major airway disease with absence of cartilaginous rings from the thoracic inlet to the mainstem bronchi was encountered. The trachea and mainstem bronchi were stented externally. A high resistance to airflow and absence of expiratory flow limitation were present, suggesting a fixed rather than variable intrathoracic obstruction of major airways. This case illustrates some potential pitfalls in preoperative assessment of patients with tracheomalacia. Recordings of airway pressure and flow during mechanical ventilation are useful in distinguishing between fixed and variable intrathoracic obstruction and may complement tests of airway anatomy.\r"

Occasionally benzodiazepines are added to these medications. The patients are assured that the medications which they have been given are free of side effects and specifically, that corticosteroids are not used. Such therapy is dangerous to the patient who not only is unaware of the medications that he or she is taking, but is unlikely to mention this therapy to his or her physician. These patients risk drug interactions, medication side effects, and the possibility of adrenal failure either with a stress to their system or on withdrawal of drug treatment. Patients are also at risk of abandoning safer forms of asthma therapy for the miracle cure. We, too, are partially responsible for these unethical practices by avoiding the use of steroids and undertreating our patients at times, leaving them unnecessarily restricted and eager for any form of relief.\r"

Sixty-three patients, 39 men and 24 women, with a mean age of 34.4 years were identified with enterovesical fistula. They had documented Crohn's disease for a mean period of 7.0 years. Distribution of anatomic pattern was 34.9 percent ileal, 7.9 percent colonic, and 57.2 percent ileocolic. Nineteen (30.1 percent) had previous abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease. Presenting symptoms included frequency and dysuria in 93.6 percent, pneumaturia in 79.3 percent, and fecaluria in 63.4 percent; 60.3 percent of patients had all three features. Enterovesical fistula was confirmed preoperatively in 43 patients, suspected clinically in 15 patients, and diagnosed intraoperatively in 5 patients. Sixty-one of 63 patients underwent surgery with resection of the phlegmon or abscess with the diseased bowel and curettage or resection of the fistula. After curettage of the bladder defect, pelvic and bladder drainage was instituted. Coexistent fistulas, most commonly ileosigmoid, occurred in 31 patients. Intra-abdominal abscesses were found in 21 patients, of whom 15 required two-stage procedures. One patient died (mortality 1.6 percent), urine leak occurred in 3.2 percent, and wound infection occurred in 1.6 percent. Follow-up (mean, 106 months) has identified one recurrence of enterovesical fistula due to Crohn's disease, and a further recurrence from concomitant sigmoid diverticulitis. Enterocutaneous fistulas developed in 6.4 percent and 11 patients (17.4 percent) have required further resections for Crohn's disease. Surgical treatment of enterovesical fistula in Crohn's disease is a safe and effective treatment.\r"

The defecographic results were screened for the anorectal angle, defined both at rest and during straining, perineal descent, and abnormalities of the rectal configuration during straining. Anal manometry, saline infusion test, rectal capacity measurement, and anal electromyography (EMG) were also performed. There was a significant difference (P less than 0.001) both at rest (22 degrees) and during straining (12 degrees) between the two anorectal angle measurements. Incontinent patients had a larger anorectal angle, both at rest and during straining, than continent patients (P less than 0.04), but with a large overlap. The anorectal angle was not influenced by gender or age. An abnormal rectal configuration was found in 62 defecographic examinations. From the 8 patients with rectopexy performed for a large rectocele or intussusception, incontinent patients with an intussusception had the best results. In four patients, anal EMG showed an increased activity of the external sphincter during straining. Two of these four patients had abnormal defecograhic results. No correlations were found between anorectal angle and the other function tests. In conclusion, the anorectal angle lacks clinical relevance. In patients with defecation problems, defecography may be indicated whenever other investigations (physical examination, anal manometry, anal EMG) have excluded local pathology or a spastic pelvic floor syndrome. In these situations, defecography could detect an intussusception, which could easily be treated with rectopexy.\r"

Staging was performed without the use of any other radiographic studies or of any clinical information except the patients' age, sex, and the diagnosis of rectal carcinoma, to test the value of computed tomographic scans alone for staging. Agreement between the two stagings performed by the first observer was 51 percent, and interobserver agreement was only 37 percent. Agreement with Dukes' staging was only 33 percent. Therefore, preoperative pelvic computed tomographic scanning of primary rectal adenocarcinoma should not be relied upon for staging or for the selection of patients for treatment options.\r"

  ".U": "90214431\r", 
  ".W": "The anastomotic compression button is a new mechanical device that uses three interlocking polypropylene buttons to produce a sutureless bowel anastomosis. The device is unique in that it allows application of the buttons via a device similar to the popular intraluminal stapler, but it leaves no staples or foreign body of any kind in the bowel wall. The authors compared the 25-mm anastomotic compression button with the 25-mm intraluminal stapler in the colon of dogs. After 28 days, the mucosal blood flow, burst pressure, and anastomotic indices were found to be identical between the anastomotic compression button and the stapler. The anastomotic compression button was easier to use, and microscopic examination showed less ulceration, fibrosis, and inflammation, and better re-epithelialization at the anastomotic compression button site. The anastomotic compression button appears to have the potential to be a superior method compared with stapled anastomoses in the colon.\r"

One thousand nine hundred twenty-seven patients (1316 men and 611 women) who had undergone curative gastrectomy for gastroduodenal diseases in the First Department of Surgery, Tottori University Hospital, during the 18-year period from 1964 to 1981, were followed to determine the incidence of the development of large-bowel carcinoma after gastric surgery. The age-, sex-, and calendar-specific population at risk was calculated by the person-years method. The observed number of colorectal cancers after gastrectomy was 19 (15 men, 4 women) compared with 9.69 expected carcinomas. The difference between the observed and expected numbers was statistically significant. The authors believe that patients with previous gastrectomy are at high risk for colorectal carcinoma.\r"

Six years after surgery, an extrarectal mucinous mass was noted, which, on biopsy, had histologic features of implantation of benign villous adenoma within the operative scar. For medical reasons, surgery was avoided and the lesion enlarged until symptoms necessitated rectal excision five years later. Histologic examination of the resected mucinous tumor supported an origin from implanted adenomatous epithelium. This is apparently the first description of implantation of an adenoma in the surgical track. Care should be taken during transsphincteric and transsacral excision of rectal adenomas to prevent implantation at the time of surgery.\r"

In selected patients, conservative surgery followed by radiation therapy (brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation) may be an alternative to radical surgery with the goals of local control of the disease and rectal sphincter preservation.

Depression, obesity, functional bowel syndrome, asthma/emphysema, trauma, and genitourinary problems are conditions suggested by prior studies to be more common in families of alcoholics than in those without an alcoholic family member. Cross-sectional data were collected from a convenience sample of adults in the waiting room of a midwestern, university based family practice clinic. The respondents were classified in two groups: those with little likelihood of familial alcoholism and those with probable familial alcoholism. The groups were matched for race and age, creating two demographically similar groups which were then analyzed as cohorts. The prevalence rates of the conditions of interest in the respondents were calculated in the two groups and compared using the chi-square test for statistical significance. Significant differences in prevalence rates of depression and obesity were found. Trends were found for differing rates of functional bowel syndrome and asthma/emphysema. No differences were found for trauma and genitourinary problems. If differences in disease prevalence truly exist between family members of alcoholic and nonalcoholic individuals, this awareness could enhance the diagnosis and treatment of the conditions of interest in the nonalcoholic relative as well as the alcoholic individual. Family members could be a powerful screening tool for alcoholism.\r"

Teachers evaluated adaptive functioning, social withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at school for a carefully selected sample of 22 boys and 24 girls (ages 7-12) whose parents had been separated for two to 18 months. Regression analyses indicated that boys' overall school adjustment was associated with better maternal parenting skills, lower child fear of abandonment, less blaming of father for the separation, and positive parental verbal attributions toward the other parent. Girls with better overall school adjustment reported less blaming of their mothers and a higher rate of positive attributions by mother about father. These findings suggest concepts family physicians can use in working with families to minimize the effect of divorce on children.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a method for assessing the doctor-patient interaction in terms of its patient-centredness. Patient-centredness was defined in terms of doctor responses which enabled patients to express all of their reasons for coming, including symptoms, thoughts, feelings and expectations. The method was tested and found to be valid (correlations for criterion validity rs = 0.51 and 0.89), reliable (inter-rater correlation rs = 0.91, intra-rater correlation rs = 0.88), and sensitive, in that it was able to detect differences among doctors (P less than 0.001) and among doctor responses to different patient offers (P less than 0.001). The method was also found to be practical in that it was inexpensive and could be used for a variety of purposes such as by tutors to give feedback to their students, by examiners as part of the evaluation of candidates' consultation skills, and by students and clinicians alike, for self-assessment. The finding that the score for the first two minutes of the consultation correlated highly with the score for the entire consultation (rs = 0.806) greatly increases the time effectiveness of the method, suggesting that it would be practical for use on a large scale, including student assessment and future studies of the relationship between patient-centredness and patient outcomes.\r"

Of 149 patients interviewed, 90.6% reported at least one non-medical problem. Half (51%) of those patients with a problem had discussed it with their doctor. More than half (55%) of those patients discussing a problem reported that the discussion was helpful. Patient compliance and satisfaction were positively associated with 'helpful' discussion, but not with discussion per se. In particular, the two aspects of doctor-patient communication which were significantly associated with feeling helped were: 'Doctor tells me all I want to know about my illness' and 'Doctor gives me a chance to say what is really on my mind'. Both factors reflect care which is oriented to patient concerns. The study results provide support for a patient-centred approach to care.\r"

Stressful life events had occurred in 44.7% of patients and the total number of events recorded was 624. More life events were found in patients who were female, older and of lower social class. Three types of clinical diagnoses were recognized: simple physical diseases (55.1%) and psychosocial illness with and without physical diseases (36.8% and 8.1% respectively). Patients who were female, older and of lower socioeconomic status and who had experienced more life events had more psychosocial problems than the rest of the group (P less than 0.001). The diagnosis of psychosocial illness could be predicted by the variables of stressful life event and age up to 66%.\r"

The results show that English general practitioners felt more responsibility for chronic problems than the Dutch doctors whereas Dutch general practitioners felt more responsibility for technical tasks than the English. Fewer general practitioners in both countries felt responsible for technical tasks than for chronic disease. Reasons for the differences in terms of the structure of general practice and training are discussed.\r"

Using double-blind methods, the panel was asked individually to give a preliminary diagnosis and a management recommendation for each case. Pairwise comparison of the evaluations showed 66% agreement for diagnosis and 79% agreement for prescription of antibiotics. Adjusting for chance agreement, the kappa index was 0.43 for prescription of antibiotics, 0.31 for diagnosis of cystitis, 0.20 for vulvovaginitis, 0.21 for pyelonephritis and 0.09 for urethritis. The specialist groups ordered significantly more laboratory investigations, resulting in a 75-95% more expensive work-up compared with general practitioners. The findings imply a need for more distinct use of the concept of 'urethritis' and are consistent with previously demonstrated differences in resource use between general practitioners and specialist physicians.\r"

Subjects with the chief complaint of fatigue persisting for more than one year were followed for an average of seven months at a university family health centre. During this time a group of commonly recommended tests were carried out and the patients had repeated physical examinations. Physical diseases and laboratory abnormalities were few, and patients with abnormal values and active problems were followed until their fatigue resolved or their abnormalities reverted to normal following therapy. The study demonstrated that the presence of an abnormal laboratory result in a fatigued individual does not necessarily indicate the cause of fatigue. A psychiatric history was also performed and patients were tested with the symptom check list 90-R (SCL-90-R), a 90-item psychological symptom check list. Seven patients were receiving psychotherapy when they enrolled in the study. Two additional subjects entered therapy after the start of the study. Results on the symptom check list for the study group were largely abnormal, with a majority scoring in the highest quartile for depression, paranoid ideation and psychoticism. It is concluded that the investigation of patients with fatigue which has lasted for longer than one year should focus on psychological causes. In this group of patients laboratory abnormalities are not useful in guiding evaluation or treatment for their fatigue.\r"

Factors such as practice organization, responsibilities for patients and availability of the physician are related to five conceptual aspects of continuity: the chronological, geographical, interdisciplinary, interpersonal and informational dimensions. In Norway patients are free to change primary care physicians as and when they wish. There is also a referral system and the patient cannot, in principle, go directly to a specialist or to a hospital. This open-access primary health care system provides a base from which continuity of care in other countries may be described and discussed.\r"

Very young drug users were mainly 'drug tourists' from neighbouring countries who were without medical insurance or money.\r"

Nearly three quarters (72.1%) had taken self-medication without consulting a medical practitioner and 51.8% of the sample had done so without the knowledge of older family members. The prevalence of self-medication increased with age. More than half the pupils (50.4%) indicated that trivial illness did not warrant a consultation with a doctor. Information relating to the sources of self-administered drugs, types of drugs used and sources of information about these drugs was collected. Medicine cabinets at home and pharmacy shops were the two most common places from which the pupils obtained their drugs. Though the prevalence of taking tranquillizers and sleeping tablets was found to be low, the probability of young people, especially boys, obtaining dangerous drugs from these places should not be overlooked. The medical, nursing and teaching professions should take a more active role in health education, as the sources from which the pupils obtained their drug knowledge, in descending order of frequency, were: family members, previous illness experience, pharmacy shops, doctor or nurse, television or radio, newspapers or magazines, friends and teachers.\r"

Thirty percent of Lynch syndrome patients had at least one adenoma; 20% had multiple adenomas. In 18% of the patients, adenomas were discovered proximal to the splenic flexure. In a reference group of 88 age- and sex-matched patients, 11% had adenomas, 4% had multiple adenomas, and 1% had right-sided adenomas. Twenty-one Lynch syndrome patients had follow-up colonoscopies. Of 7 patients with adenomas on initial examinations, 6 had adenomas at follow-up. Of 14 patients with negative initial examination results, 3 had adenomas at follow-up. The prevalence of adenomas in the Lynch syndromes is greater than in an unselected reference group. The adenomas are more proximally located, corresponding to the site of cancer distribution in the Lynch syndromes. A high rate of synchronous and metachronous lesions is found. Our findings support the hypothesis that adenomatous changes are the premalignant lesion in the Lynch syndromes. We also found evidence of heterogeneity among Lynch syndrome families in adenoma incidence.\r"

Evidence for a dose-response relationship could be identified in women but not men. Cigarette smoking may not only be a risk factor for development of Crohn's disease but also may influence disease activity following surgery.\r"

Sections of jejunum, ileum, and colon were obtained for morphometric analysis on days 3, 6, 9, and 12 postinfection, and in vivo perfusion studies of jejunum and ileum were conducted on days 3 and 4 postinfection. The most severe morphologic lesion was seen in the ileum on day 3, and consisted of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and cellular infiltration. Villous surface area was reduced from 2.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) microns2 in control ileum to 0.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) microns2 in infected ileum, a result associated with enterocytes that were fewer in number and reduced in cross-sectional area. Conversely, the number of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria of the villus increased from 456 +/- 116 in control to 1014 +/- 187 in infected villus without a significant change in the volume of the lamina propria. At the height of infection, there was an approximate 1:2 ratio of both organisms and inflammatory cells to villous enterocytes. In contrast, organisms were not observed in the crypts, and the concentration of inflammatory cells in crypt lamina propria was unaltered. Disappearance of organisms and polymorphonuclear cells from the ileum was associated with restoration of normal structure and was complete by day 12. Although organisms were seen in the colon, the general architecture was not severely affected. On days 3 and 4 postinfection, there was a complete impairment of the glucose-stimulated Na and water absorption in both jejunum and ileum of infected pigs; however, absorption of electrolytes and water from a basic Ringer's solution, in the absence of glucose, was not significantly affected. These results are consistent with a malabsorptive diarrheal disease associated with the morphological damage and are very similar to those seen in enteric viral disease in pigs, except that the upper intestine is more severely affected in the latter.\r"

Thirty-two (17%) patients were referred from Gassim Region at the north central part of Saudi Arabia. In contrast, only 5% of total cancer patient referrals were from this area. A case-control study showed a significant regional difference within Saudi Arabia and the most referrals from Gassim area. A prospective case-control study showed persistently high numbers of referrals from that region during 1983-1987. When patients from Gassim Region were compared with those referred from other locations, no statistical differences were noted between the two groups except for the source of drinking water. Water analysis from Gassim area showed a high solid content with elevated levels of calcium, magnesium, and to a lesser extent, chromium iron, cadmium, and cobalt. Traces of petroleum oil were found in five of six water samples from Gassim during 1983, compared with 3 of 49 samples from other areas. Mutagenicity tests on water specimens form Gassim Region indicated the presence of possible carcinogens. It is being suggested that the high prevalence of esophageal cancer in this region may be related to contamination of water by impurities such as petroleum oils. Malnutrition, particularly vitamin A deficiency, as well as other factors may have promoted such malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of distension and isovolumetric contraction of urinary bladder on colonic motility were studied in anesthetized cats. Distension and contraction of the urinary bladder induced an inhibition of spontaneous colonic electromyographic activity and a decrease in the amplitudes of the excitatory junction potentials evoked in the colon by stimulation of the distal end of the parasympathetic nerve fibers. This inhibition was blocked by guanethidine and phentolamine. Reversely, vesical emptying resulted in an increase in colonic motility, abolished by atropine, and an increase in the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials. Both excitatory and inhibitory reflexes disappeared after hexamethonium. The inhibitory effects of bladder distension were abolished by bilateral section of the lumbar ventral or dorsal spinal roots and after bilateral section of the lumbar colonic or hypogastric nerves. These results indicate (a) that the vesical afferents responsible for the inhibitory and excitatory reflexes run in the hypogastric and pelvic nerves respectively and (b) that the inhibitory and excitatory effects are caused by the activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent nerve fibers, respectively. The supraspinal nervous structures were not implicated in these reflexes because they persisted in spinal cats.\r"

  ".W": "We have assessed the changes in gastroduodenal motility responsible for the delay in gastric emptying produced by cold stress. Antropyloroduodenal pressures were recorded in 7 healthy volunteers, concurrent with scintigraphic measurement of gastric emptying. The manometric assembly incorporated a sleeve sensor located across the pylorus and side holes in the antrum and the duodenum. When approximately 25% of a 100-g 99m Tc-labeled ground beef burger had emptied from the stomach, a standardized cold pressor test was applied. This consisted of 60-s immersions of the left hand in iced water (4 degrees C), with 15-s rest periods between immersions, for up to 20 min. Cold stress was associated with slowed emptying from the total stomach (median, 17% before stress vs. 2% during stress; p less than 0.01) and the proximal stomach (9% before vs. 3% during; p less than 0.01). Retrograde movement of the solid meal from the distal to the proximal stomach was observed in 4 subjects. Cold stress increased the number of isolated pyloric pressure waves (p less than 0.05), and decreased the number of antral (p less than 0.01) and propagated antropyloroduodenal pressure waves (p less than 0.05). Phase 3-like duodenal activity occurred in 2 subjects during the first 5 min of stress; otherwise there was a reduction in the number of duodenal pressure waves during stress (p less than 0.05). Basal pyloric pressure was not elevate before, during, or after stress. We conclude that in addition to the previously reported antral inhibition, cold stress is associated with changes in pyloric and duodenal motility and, in some subjects, in the intragastric distribution of food. These modifications in gastroduodenal motility are likely to contribute to the delay in gastric emptying produced by this stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "5-Aminosalicylic acid, the therapeutically active metabolite of sulfasalazine, was exposed to oxygen-derived free radicals produced by the Fenton reaction in vitro, and several metabolites were detected and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The majority of these metabolites were present in methanolic extracts of feces samples from sulfasalazine-treated patients with inflammatory bowel disease but not in rheumatoid arthritis patients with normal bowel function. The presence of these metabolites, which have not been demonstrated in vivo before, provides evidence of an interaction between 5-aminosalicylic acid and oxygen-derived free radicals in sulfasalazine-treated patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Since the concentration of lipid peroxides, which is dependent on the release of oxygen-derived free radicals, was significantly increased in pretreatment rectal biopsies of the patients, and further was normalized concomitantly with a significant improvement in disease activity over the 5-wk treatment period, an important role of the radical scavenger mechanism of 5-aminosalicylic acid in sulfasalazine therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel disease is strongly suggested.\r"

  ".W": "Mucins synthesized in colonic cancer are known to be different from those in the normal colon; however, the biochemical differences between these mucins have not been defined. We have purified mucins from samples of nonneoplastic (normal) human colon and colon cancer and found that the carbohydrate content of the cancer-associated mucins is 48% of that in the normal colon, including significant reductions in galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and fucose. By subjecting the mucins to alkaline degradation, we determined that there are 19% fewer oligosaccharide chains per milligram of cancer-associated colonic mucin than there are in mucins from normal colons. We also found a reduction in mean oligosaccharide chain length in cancer-associated mucin (5.83 carbohydrate residues per chain) compared with those derived from normal colons (10.2 residues). Total and individual amino acid contents were greater in cancer-associated mucins, with the exception of three amino acids (threonine, serine, and proline), two of which represent the O-linked glycosylation sites for glycoproteins. Thus, mucins are aberrantly glycosylated in colon cancer, both in terms of the number and mean chain length of the oligosaccharide moiety. Because of their relative abundance in colonic tissue, mucins appear to be useful molecular species in the study of the derangements in protein glycosylation that occur during neoplasia.\r"

  ".U": "90215095\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of various leukotrienes to alter the susceptibility of the rat gastric mucosa to injury by 20% ethanol and the possible mechanism of action were examined using an ex vivo gastric chamber preparation. Intraarterial infusions of leukotriene B4 or N-acetyl leukotriene E4 (0.01-1.0 microgram/kg per min for 10 min) had no significant effect on the extent of damage induced by topically applied 20% ethanol. However, infusion of leukotriene C4, D4, or E4 (1.0 micrograms/kg per min) significantly increased ethanol-induced damage, as measured macroscopically, histologically, and functionally. Lower doses of leukotriene C4, D4, or E4 were without significant effect in this model. The increase in damage induced by these three leukotrienes could be blocked by pretreatment with either of two structurally unrelated leukotriene D4 antagonists (L-649,923 or L-660,711). The augmentation of damage by leukotriene C4 was not affected by pretreatment with indomethacin or with a specific thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist (L-670,596). At the dose that increased ethanol-induced damage, none of the leukotrienes tested significantly altered gastric vascular permeability, as measured by Evan's blue leakage. However, using laser-Doppler flowmetry, leukotrienes C4 and D4 were found, when administered intraarterially at doses in the 0.05-1.0 micrograms/kg per min range, to produce dose-dependent reductions of gastric blood flow while N-acetyl leukotriene E4 was without effect and leukotriene B4 induced slight increases. The effects of leukotrienes C4 and D4 on gastric blood flow could be inhibited by the two leukotriene D4 antagonists but not by the thromboxane antagonist. These results demonstrate that although they do not produce damage by themselves, leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 are capable of augmenting ethanol-induced injury to the gastric mucosa. Changes in vascular permeability do not appear to play a role in the mechanism of action of the leukotrienes, while their effects on gastric blood flow are likely to be important. Under certain condition it is therefore possible that local release of leukotrienes could, at least in part through reducing vascular perfusion, predispose the surrounding tissue necrosis.\r"

Tolerance for stepwise distention of a balloon in the rectosigmoid was compared with tolerance for holding one hand in ice water in 16 irritable bowel patients, 10 patients with functional bowel disorder who did not satisfy restrictive criteria for irritable bowel, 25 lactose malabsorbers, and 18 asymptomatic controls. Contractile activity was measured 5 cm above and 5 cm below the distending balloon. Psychometric tests were used to assess neuroticism, anxiety, and depression, and a standardized psychiatric interview was administered. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome had significantly lower tolerance for balloon distention but not ice water, and balloon tolerance was not correlated with neuroticism or other psychological traits measured. Rectosigmoid and rectal motility were also not related to tolerance for balloon distention. Both hypotheses were rejected. A peripheral mechanism such as altered receptor sensitivity may be the cause of distention pain in irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

In 9 fasting healthy volunteers, we performed graded balloon distentions (2.5 min duration at 10-min intervals) of either the antroduodenal junction (n = 6) or the distal duodenum (n = 6). Gastric tone was quantified as changes in the volume of air within an intragastric bag maintained at a constant pressure by an electronic barostat. Perception was scored by a graded (0-6) questionnaire. Distention of the antroduodenal junction induced dose-related gastric relaxatory responses: distention at a level producing significant perception (5.0 +/- 0.1 perception score) induced significant relaxation (203 +/- 39 ml change in intragastric volume; p less than 0.05); lower levels of distention still induced relaxation (113 +/- 30 ml change in volume; p less than 0.05) without significant perception (1.0 +/- 0.5 perception score). In the distal duodenum, distention at the threshold for discomfort (5.1 +/- 0.3 perception score) induced significantly smaller gastric relaxatory responses (42 +/- 17 ml change in volume). Distentions below the level of significant perception (1.5 +/- 0.7 perception score) failed to induce gastric responses (14 +/- 15 ml change in volume). These data indicate that both perceived and unperceived gastric relaxatory reflexes in response to distention exist in humans and that these reflexes are region dependent.\r"

  ".U": "90215098\r", 
  ".W": "The human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 undergoes spontaneous enterocytic differentiation during growth and expresses a number of brush-border membrane-associated hydrolases typical of a differentiated phenotype. Among these is the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which is frequently used as a marker of cell differentiation in colon cancer cells. Since the biochemical processes regulating the expression of alkaline phosphatase during cell differentiation are only poorly understood, we examined the biosynthesis and processing of alkaline phosphatases in undifferentiated (0-day confluent) and differentiated (14-day confluent) Caco-2 cells. It was found that both cell phenotypes expressed a single, heat-labile intestinal-like enzyme, which undergoes similar post-translational processing and glycosylation. Although the rate of enzyme synthesis and alkaline phosphatase messenger ribonucleic acid was 5-6-fold higher in differentiated cells, the degradation rates in both cell types were similar with a half-life of approximately 10 days. These results suggest that the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity during Caco-2 cell differentiation is caused by changes in the synthetic rate and that the low turnover rates facilitate accumulation of the enzyme. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that Caco-2 cells are useful for examining the molecular and biochemical events involved in the differentiation of the small intestinal epithelium.\r"

The subjects were 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 6 of whom were constipation predominant and 6 of whom were diarrhea predominant, and 8 healthy controls. The procedure was well tolerated by all subjects and did not interfere with sleep or normal activity. In all subjects, the diurnal migrating motor complex cycle was characterized by a brief phase 1 and a prolonged phase 2; this was reversed during sleep when phase 2 was virtually absent. All subjects showed a circadian variation in migrating motor complex propagation velocity, and there was no difference in the patterns of motor activity during sleep between any of the groups. During the day, the duration of postprandial motor activity was shorter in irritable bowel syndrome patients than in controls, and diurnal migrating motor complex intervals were shorter in diarrhea-predominant than in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. In 11 of 12 inflammatory bowel syndrome patients, episodes of clustered contractions recurring at 0.9-min intervals were noted; these episodes had a mean duration of 46 min and were often associated with transient abdominal pain and discomfort. In both groups of irritable bowel syndrome patients, defecation was significantly (p less than 0.01) prolonged with a greater number of voluntary abdominal contractions (p less than 0.01) than in controls. Prolonged ambulant monitoring of proximal bowel motor activity in subjects who are free to move, eat, and sleep as they choose has, for the first time, clearly defined the striking difference in motility between the sleeping and waking state and shown that abnormalities associated with irritable bowel syndrome are confined to the latter.\r"

Specimens were divided into three regions: (a) the mucosa; (b) the myenteric and submucosal plexuses with the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles; and (c) the circular smooth muscle, for biochemical analysis of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (total indoles) and noradrenaline. In both groups of patients, serotonin- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity was localized in nerves in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, and a sparse innervation was observed in the circular muscle. In addition, intense serotonin-like fluorescence was present in a large number of enterochromaffin cells in the mucosa. Total indole levels were significantly increased in the mucosa (p less than 0.02) and circular muscle (p less than 0.05) of the constipated patients. In contrast, no changes in noradrenaline levels were observed in any of the regions studied. Altered levels of total indoles may thus contribute to severe idiopathic constipation. Analysis of biopsy specimens could be a useful tool in clinical diagnosis and future investigations of diseases of the gut.\r"

To simulate injury, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given methotrexate, 2.5 mg/kg body wt, subcutaneously for 3 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last methotrexate injection, rats were placed on diets containing either 0%, 1%, or 10% safflower oil. Mucosal weight, protein, deoxyribonucleic acid, maltase, sucrase, lactase, alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, and fatty acids were all determined 3 and 12 days after methotrexate. Crypt-cell production rates were also determined. Essential fatty acid deficiency was confirmed in the 0% safflower oil group, in which triene-tetraene ratios were greater than 0.4. Mucosal weight, deoxyribonucleic acid, protein content, and villus height were all greater in the 1% safflower oil group than in the 0% group at 12 days. In the ileum, 1-h thymidine incorporation was greater in the 0% safflower oil group than in the other two groups. No differences in any of the parameters studied were observed between the 1% and 10% groups. These results suggest that diets deficient in essential fatty acids may impair the recovery of intestinal mucosa from injury.\r"

The first 34 were part of a prospective longitudinal study that included manometric and radiographic evaluation of the esophagus. Heartburn (48%) and dysphagia (38%) were by far the most common gastrointestinal symptoms. Seventeen percent of patients undergoing manometry had distal esophageal aperistalsis, and 43% low-amplitude peristalsis (less than 30 mmHg). Studies in 10 patients before and after treatment suggested that esophageal dysfunction in mixed connective tissue disease may be responsive to corticosteroids. Upper esophageal sphincter hypotension was also common. One patient had marked upper esophageal sphincter hypotension and recurrent aspiration, which resolved with corticosteroid therapy. Findings on radiographic studies of the stomach and small bowel in 54 patients and barium enemas in 16 patients were reviewed. Our series included one case each of malabsorption, colonic and small bowel perforations due to vasculitis, chronic active hepatitis, and acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, any area of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected by mixed connective tissue disease, although the esophagus is the most common location. The gastrointestinal aspects of mixed connective tissue disease overlap with those of progressive systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of rectally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on gastric mucosal damage, as well as on mucosal prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Fasting male rats were treated intrarectally with 0.5 ml 1% NaHCO3 solution containing several concentrations of either indomethacin, aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, or sulindac and concomitantly received 1 ml of 150 mM HCL intragastrically. Control rats received intrarectally the vehicle only. After 4 h, lesions in the secretory part of the stomach were scored and mucosal prostaglandin E2 synthesis was determined by the ex vivo prostaglandin generation technique. Dose-dependent mucosal damage was observed in indomethacin- and diclofenac-treated rats. Ketoprofen damage did not show dose dependency. In sulindac- and aspirin-treated rats, as well as in controls, no damage was detected. All drugs induced a significant and comparable degree of inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis. There was no correlation between the severity of the mucosal damage and the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis. The ulcerogenicity of rectally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is therefore not directly related to the degree of inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis and is probably related to the specific chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of each individual drug.\r"

In the present study, we examined immunohistochemically ulcerative colitis lesions with monoclonal antibodies to activation neoepitopes in the complement component C3b and in the cytolytically active terminal complement complex. Colonic tissue specimens from 23 patients with ulcerative colitis were examined by indirect two-color immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies to the four human immunoglobulin G subclasses and to activated complement C3b or terminal complement complex. All except two patients had activated C3b deposited apically on the surface epithelium of involved mucosa. Immunoglobulin G1 was found on the epithelium in extensively prewashed specimens from 7 of 11 patients, and a striking colocalization of immunoglobulin G1, C3b, and terminal complement complex was observed in 4. Immune deposits were not observed in 31 noninflamed specimens from the same ulcerative colitis patients. Only 1 of 44 histologically normal mucosae from 17 controls and 1 of 10 colonic adenomas contained some epithelial complement deposits. It is concluded that activated complement is often deposited along the brush border of the surface epithelium in active ulcerative colitis lesions and may be associated with immunoglobulin G1 autoantibody.\r"

All gallstones, however, contain noncholesterol components that are insoluble in lipid solvents and may be too large to be aspirated through a small catheter or flushed from the gallbladder. To identify which patients have gallstones that are most likely to completely dissolve, we evaluated the ability of methyl tert-butyl ether to dissolve gallstones in vitro based on their radiodensity and size. Radiodensity influenced completeness of dissolution (p less than 0.01), but size did not (p greater than 0.5). Twenty-six of 32 radiolucent stones (81%) dissolved completely, leaving residual debris less than 2 mm in diameter. Only 2 of 32 radiopaque stones (6%) dissolved completely. Insoluble radiolucent and radiopaque stones less than 0.5 cm in diameter were black pigment stones. Four radiolucent and 19 of 22 radiopaque stones (86%) greater than 0.5 cm in diameter underwent partial dissolution leaving residual debris 2 mm or larger. By infrared spectroscopy, calcium bilirubinate and calcium carbonate were identified as the principal components of this methyl tert-butyl ether-insoluble debris. Until methods for dissolving or fragmenting noncholesterol components of gallstones are available, only patients with radiolucent gallstones should be treated with methyl tert-butyl ether.\r"

  ".W": "It was recently shown that intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells in situ or after isolation from rat liver have coated pits and vesicles, suggesting that they participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, using a morphologic approach and epidermal growth factor coupled to horseradish peroxidase or colloidal gold as probes, we studied freshly isolated or short-term cultured intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells prepared from normal rat liver to determine if they participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor was also used to examine for the presence of the growth factor receptor on the cells. Immediately after isolation, the cells did not internalize either epidermal growth factor-horseradish peroxidase or epidermal growth factor-colloidal gold; no growth factor receptor could be shown on these cells by immunocytochemistry, either. In contrast, cells cultured for 24 h bound and internalized both epidermal growth factor-horseradish peroxidase and epidermal growth factor-colloidal gold at 37 degrees C and showed growth factor receptors diffusely distributed on the plasma membrane. When cultured cells exposed to epidermal growth factor-colloidal gold were fixed with glutaraldehyde containing saponin and tannic acid, colloidal gold particles were observed in coated pits and in coated and uncoated vesicles. Preincubation of cultured cells with native epidermal growth factor completely blocked the internalization of both epidermal growth factor-horseradish peroxidase and epidermal growth factor-colloidal gold. When rat liver was stained in situ for epidermal growth factor receptor, reaction product was observed by immunoelectron microscopy exclusively on the basal surface of the plasma membrane of the intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells. These results indicate that bile duct epithelial cells internalize epidermal growth factor by endocytosis via coated pits containing receptors localized in situ exclusively to the basal domain of their plasma membranes. The data demonstrate for the first time that intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis and raise the possibility that they are a target for epidermal growth factor.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous pancreatic prostaglandin production in control and obstructive jaundice was investigated using isolated and perfused dog pancreas. In both groups, spontaneous production of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2 was recorded, and the levels did not change in both groups. The production of both prostaglandins in jaundice, however, was higher than that in the control on stimulation by 8 x 10(-11) mol of cholecystokinin-octapeptide. Amylase release with cholecystokinin-octapeptide at an amount of 8 x 10(-11) mol in jaundice was higher than in the control. The amylase release in both groups, however, showed further elevation on indomethacin pretreatment. On incubation of pancreatic dispersed cells in both groups, prostaglandin production in jaundiced cells was higher than that in control cells. These data showed that enhanced endogenous prostaglandin in obstructive jaundice might be caused by the characteristic change of pancreatic cells, which increased susceptibility to cholecystokinin-octapeptide because of long-term exposure to abnormal blood components, and enhanced prostaglandins might act as a cytoprotector of acinar cells in the pancreas damaged by cholecystokinin-octapeptide administration.\r"

  ".U": "90215112\r", 
  ".W": "The present study evaluated the mechanism of cholecystokinin-induced gallbladder contraction in awake opossums. Each of 19 chronic animal preparations had an indwelling gallbladder cannula for monitoring changes in gallbladder volume and a jugular catheter for administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide and drugs. An intraduodenal catheter allowed intraduodenal infusion of Isocal (Mead Johnson Laboratories, Evansville, Ind.). Bipolar electrodes in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum enabled monitoring of the duodenal migratory myoelectric complex cycle. One-hour infusions of cholecystokinin octapeptide (10 ng/kg/min), intraduodenal Isocal (0.4 ml/min), or feeding were started 20 min after cessation of phase 3 duodenal migratory myoelectric complex activity. Bolus intravenous doses of potential pharmacological antagonists were given 10 min before and 20 min after the onset of cholecystokinin octapeptide infusion, Isocal infusion, or feeding. Each test challenge induced about 60% gallbladder emptying at 30 min and 70% at 60 min. Cholecystokinin octapeptide-induced gallbladder emptying was converted to filling by hexamethonium and nearly abolished by atropine. Similar results were obtained for gallbladder emptying induced by feeding or duodenal infusion of Isocal. Phentolamine caused a modest decrease of cholecystokinin octapeptide-induced gallbladder contraction at 30 min, whereas postprandial or Isocal-induced gallbladder contraction was unaffected. Cholecystokinin octapeptide-induced gallbladder contraction was not affected by pirenzepine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide, prazosin, pyrilamine, cimetidine, methysergide, naloxone, or propranolol. In acute studies of anesthetized animals, gallbladder contraction induced by a D100 intravenous bolus of cholecystokinin octapeptide (800 ng/kg) was not antagonized by hexamethonium, atropine, or tetrodotoxin. It is concluded (a) that cholecystokinin-induced physiologic contraction of the opossum gallbladder occurs through neural mechanisms rather than by a direct action of cholecystokinin on gallbladder smooth muscle, and (b) that studies using pharmacologic bolus doses of cholecystokinin octapeptide and tetrodotoxin indicate that cholecystokinin receptors exist on the gallbladder smooth muscle which do not seem to have any physiological role in gallbladder emptying.\r"

In 6 healthy men, the gallbladder emptying driven by intravenous infusion of stepwise increasing doses of cerulein (10-80 ng/kg . h) and that induced by a 550-cal standard meal were monitored by ultrasonography. In both sets of experiments, the effect of loxiglumide was tested at various infusional rates against a control infusion of saline. An infusional rate of 2.5 mg/kg . h of loxiglumide abolished the gallbladder response even to maximal doses of cerulein, whereas a rate of 1.0 mg/kg . h counteracted the cholecystokinetic activity of cerulein up to the dose of 20 ng/kg . h. In postprandial experiments, the cholecystokinin antagonist dose-dependently inhibited the physiologic gallbladder contraction. The maximal gallbladder emptying, which always occurred 85 min after the meal, was 71.1% +/- 3.3% of basal volume in control studies, 39.2% +/- 1.8% during infusion of 2.5 mg/kg . h of loxiglumide, and 17.3% +/- 5.9% when 5.0 mg/kg . h were infused. A dose of 7.5 mg/kg . h of loxiglumide was able to prevent any postprandial emptying of the gallbladder. The present study shows that a selective cholecystokinin receptorial blockade competitively antagonizes cerulein-induced gallbladder contraction and dose-dependently inhibits postprandial gallbladder emptying.\r"

  ".U": "90215114\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the effects of luminal protease inhibition on duodenal delivery and the intraluminal fate of pancreatic enzymes, six healthy subjects were intubated with an oro-ileal multilumen tube assembly. By using nonabsorbable markers, cumulative trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and amylase activities were measured as delivered to duodenum, midjejunum, and distal ileum, with or without simultaneous duodenal perfusion of the protease inhibitor camostat at graded doses. Compared with saline, camostat (a) inhibited trypsin activity in the entire small intestinal lumen by up to 99%, and significantly reduced chymotrypsin activity by up to 89%; (b) significantly increased duodenal deliveries of lipase activity, amylase activity and volume; (c) did not influence plasma cholecystokinin concentrations; and (d) significantly increased jejunal and ileal deliveries of lipase but not amylase activity. Small intestinal transit and motility were not affected by camostat. In additional in vitro studies, camostat significantly reduced the spontaneous decline in lipase activity in fresh human duodenal juice incubated at 37 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that duodenal deliveries of lipase and amylase activities increase when intraluminal protease activity is decreased; they suggest that this increase is not caused by slower proteolytic destruction of enzyme protein but by stimulation of pancreatic secretion. Thus, luminal protease-mediated feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion may be operative in humans. Because plasma cholecystokinin concentrations were not affected, these effects may in part be independent of cholecystokinin. The data further suggest that proteolytic digestion plays a major role in the rapid loss of luminal lipase activity on small intestinal transit.\r"

Beginning with patient 8, gamma-globulin prophylaxis was routinely administered to most patients. Twelve potential risk factors for cytomegalovirus infection were evaluated and included pretransplant cytomegalovirus serological status of donor and recipient; recipient's age, sex, race, and liver disease; number and type of blood products transfused; type and intensity of immunosuppression; and occurrence of rejection. The Cox proportional hazards model identified positive donor cytomegalovirus serology as the single most important risk factor for subsequent development of cytomegalovirus infection, regardless of recipient cytomegalovirus serological status. In addition, use of gamma-globulin prophylaxis seemed to be protective against the occurrence of disseminated cytomegalovirus disease.\r"

Gallbladder emptying, measured by cholescintigraphy, and endogenous cholecystokinin secretion, measured by radioimmunoassay, were studied after both intragastric and intraduodenal administration of corn oil. In addition, the gallbladder responsiveness to cholecystokinin was investigated by infusion of stepwise increasing doses of exogenous cholecystokinin. In the 6 patients with truncal vagotomy, plasma CCK and gallbladder responses to intraduodenal fat were significantly delayed compared to normal subjects. In contrast, the onset of the plasma cholecystokinin increase and gallbladder emptying after intragastric fat was significantly earlier in the vagotomized patients compared with the normal subjects. In the normal subjects, plasma cholecystokinin and gallbladder responses to intragastric fat were significantly lower during the first 25 min after stimulation compared with the results after intraduodenal fat, whereas in the patients with truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, no differences in plasma cholecystokinin and gallbladder responses were found according to the site of fat stimulation. The gallbladder-emptying response to exogenous cholecystokinin increased significantly in patients who had undergone truncal vagotomy. It is concluded (a) that truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty influences the timing but not the magnitude of fat-stimulated gallbladder contraction and endogenous cholecystokinin secretion; and (b) that the sensitivity of the gallbladder to endogenous and exogenous cholecystokinin is significantly increased in patients with truncal vagotomy.\r"

We evaluated the in vitro ability of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, citrate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and ionic or nonionic detergents to dissolve the predominantly calcium bilirubinate and calcium carbonate debris remaining after methyl tert-butyl ether gallstone dissolution. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 1% or 2% at pH 9.5 was the most effective of the solvents studied for dissolving calcium and bile pigment. The addition of cholate (25-200 mM) or polysorbate (1%-10%) to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 1% at pH 9.5 enhanced pigment dissolution compared to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid alone. Dissolution of pellets prepared from human gallstones and composed predominantly of either calcium bilirubinate or calcium carbonate was 80% and 85% at 4 h using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 1% plus polysorbate-20 1% at pH 9.5. We conclude that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, either alone or with a detergent, is an effective solvent for methyl tert-butyl ether-insoluble gallstone debris and deserves assessment in vivo.\r"

On presentation, she had a plasma total cholesterol concentration of 53.40 mM (2065 mg/dl) and a relative serum viscosity of 2.9. Following three courses of plasma exchange in a 5-day period, the total cholesterol level decreased to 6.75 mM (261 mg/dl) and the viscosity to 1.3. The cutaneous xanthomata were markedly diminished 1 wk following plasma exchange. Despite therapy with colestipol (30 g/d), the hyperviscosity syndrome developed 147 days later. This cycle recurred again 137 days after colestipol was discontinued. Serum viscosity and total cholesterol concentration were highly correlated during the postexchange or accumulation phases (R = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.98) and during the exchange or interventional phases (R = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99). Serum viscosity was less significantly correlated with total serum protein (R = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95) or with plasma triglyceride (R = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.81). There were no significant correlations of red cell mass, plasma fibrinogen levels, or serum bile salts with viscosity. Subfractionation of plasma into lipoprotein classes showed 45% of total cholesterol in the lipoprotein X fraction and a presumptive slow alpha-lipoprotein species. It is postulated that both the hyperviscosity syndrome and rapid resolution of xanthomata in the patient may be attributable to the physiology of her abnormal lipoprotein particles.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showed that symptoms of oesophageal motor disorders can be misinterpreted as indicating anorexia nervosa and that in primary anorexia nervosa gastric motility is frequently impaired. We investigated in 32 women with bulimia nervosa whether symptoms of oesophageal motor disorders could be obscured by or be mistaken as forming part of bulimic behaviour, and whether impaired gastric motility was frequent as well. Oesophageal motility was normal in 18 of 26 patients studied, another four had incomplete lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Two patients had vigorous achalasia and each one achalasia and diffuse oesophageal spasm, all of whom experienced two types of vomiting: one self-induced and one involuntary, in which the vomit was non-acidic and tasted as the preceding meal. Gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied in all patients except of the eight with oesophageal motor abnormalities. Emptying was significantly slower than in healthy controls and grossly delayed in nine of 24 patients. Antral contraction amplitudes were lower and increased less postcibally than in controls. In conclusion (i) bulimic behaviour can obscure symptoms of oesophageal motor disorders and (ii) gastric emptying is frequently delayed in bulimia nervosa.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of distal oesophageal acidification on lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure in normal human volunteers and in cats. The distal oesophagus was acidified by intraluminal injection of 0.1N HCl (pH 1.2). The LOS pressure was recorded by a sleeve device while pharyngeal and oesophageal pressures were monitored by nonperfused, water filled catheters. In normal human subjects, distal oesophageal acidification did not elicit a change in LOS pressure. In anaesthetised cats, injection of acid into the distal oesophagus elicited immediate LOS relaxation followed by a secondary peristaltic sequence. With propagation of the peristaltic sequence into the LOS, the LOS pressure abruptly increased 20-100 mmHg and gradually returned to the preinjection value over 15-180 s. In the one instance in which we were able to acidify the distal oesophagus without evoking secondary peristalsis, the LOS pressure did not change. Injection of saline into the distal oesophagus evoked a response in the LOS and oesophageal body that was indistinguishable from that seen with acid. We conclude that contrary to common belief, distal oesophageal acidification itself does not affect LOS pressure in man or the cat.\r"

In all experimental groups, the enterochromaffin like cells were found to incorporate the DNA precursor, thus indicating an ability to divide. The serum gastrin concentration was raised by antrum exclusion and reduced by antrectomy. After antrum exclusion, the enterochromaffin like cell proliferation rate increased as indicated by a doubling of the labelling index and by the resulting enterochromaffin like cell hyperplasia (after six weeks). After antrectomy, the enterochromaffin like cell labelling index decreased to reach 25% of the control value; at this time the enterochromaffin like cell density had not decreased significantly. The observed correlation between the enterochromaffin like cell labelling indices and the serum gastrin concentration supports the hypothesis that enterochromaffin like cell proliferation is influenced by serum gastrin.\r"

Our study group consisted of 17 patients: six with mild atrophic gastritis, seven with moderate atrophic gastritis and four with severe atrophic gastritis. None of the patients had type-A atrophic gastritis but the body mucosa was affected by superficial gastritis at various extent in some. A group of 15 healthy subjects served as control. All subjects underwent gastroscopic examination with multiple bioptic sampling. Radioimmunoassay was used for gastrin determination and photomicroscopy for gastrin producing cell density assessment. Electron microscopy was used to assess the gastrin producing granule density index. Patients with moderate and severe atrophic gastritis showed a lower gastric acidity and acid output as compared to control. Serum gastrin did not show significant differences among the groups. In moderate and severe atrophic gastritis, gastrin producing cell granule density index, gastrin producing cell density and antral mucosa gastrin concentration were significantly lower when compared with control and decreased with advancing of the severity of atrophic gastritis. In atrophic gastritis, however, the latter two measurements were not correlated. In moderate and severe atrophic gastritis luminal gastrin concentration significantly increased, compared with control, after the severity of atrophic gastritis. Gastrin producing cell granule density index and luminal gastrin concentration showed a significant correlation with gastric pH. These data suggest that in antral atrophic gastritis with reduced gastric acidity, the decrement of gastrin producing cells is followed by gastrin producing cell hyperfunction with increased luminal release of gastrin.\r"

Previous retrospective work has suggested that lymphocytic gastritis is related to an endoscopic form of gastropathy comprising enlarged folds, nodules and erosions, commonly denoted as varioliform gastritis. In the present prospective study, the relationship is clearly shown; nearly 82% (54/66) of the varioliform gastritis observed in four different endoscopy units correspond histologically to lymphocytic gastritis. The correlation is even better if cases showing strictly antral localisation are excluded (53/55) - that is, more than 96%. The histological concept of lymphocytic gastritis seems, however, to extend beyond varioliform gastritis as of 67 cases of lymphocytic gastritis diagnosed during the period under study, one third had no particular endoscopic expression.\r"

Individuals with less than two migrating motor complexes (MMCs) starting from the antral region in 240 minutes and without evidence of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases were randomly treated with either cisapride (10 cases), or placebo (10 cases) for 15 days. Computerised manometry of antroduodenal region was performed for 240 minutes, in basal conditions and on the 15th day of therapy. Symptomatic evaluation of patients was also performed before and after treatment. After cisapride administration, a significant increase in the incidence of antral migrating motor complexes was noticed (p = 0.022); likewise, the motility index, calculated for phase-2 periods, appeared to be significantly higher both in the antrum and in the duodenum (p less than 0.001). Symptomatic improvement was observed in both groups, with a hardly significant (p = 0.049) reduction of dyspeptic symptoms severity only but not of frequency in cisapride treated patients v controls. We conclude that longterm oral therapy with cisapride improves interdigestive antroduodenal motor activity.\r"

Peripheral blood leucocytes from recurrent aphthous ulceration patients exerted a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) degree of cytotoxicity towards the oral epithelial target cells than did peripheral blood leucocytes from healthy control subjects, or from patients with non-specific ulceration. Depletion of CD-5 positive cells (T-lymphocytes) resulted in a significant decrease in the SCMC in aphthous patients. Depletion of CD-16 positive cells (NK-cells) produced no significant change in cytotoxicity. T-lymphocytes, therefore, appear to be intimately involved in the in vitro SCMC effect in recurrent aphthous ulceration.\r"

Forty were breath CH4 producers and 25 were not. Statistically significant differences were observed between both groups, with lower values for CH4 producers recorded for the following parameters: fasting basal value of breath H2 (8.1 (4.9) v 5.2 (3.7) ppm, p less than 0.05), mouth-to-caecum transit time (68 (24) v 111 (52) min, p less than 0.005), and breath H2 production measured as area under the curve 13.1 (6.9) v 8.8 (3.8) 10(3) ppm/min, p less than 0.02). There was no significant correlation between individual production of breath H2 and CH4. These results indicate that the response to lactulose depends on breath CH4 producing status. In clinical practice, defining normal values of mouth-to-caecum transit time without knowledge of breath CH4 producing status may lead to misinterpretation of the H2 breath test.\r"

Treated rats were fed ethanol as 36% of total energy in a nutritionally adequate liquid diet. Paired controls were fed isovolumetric amounts of the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isocaloric glucose. After six weeks the total cytoplasmic and contractile protein content in immature rats was reduced by 18% and 31%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.007). The decline in the stromal protein content (26%) was not statistically significant (p = 0.130). In mature rats the protein contents were also reduced in the cytoplasmic (25%, p = 0.035) and contractile (27%, p = 0.005) protein fractions, though the stromal protein fraction was unaltered (p = 0.913). In immature rats fractional rates of protein synthesis in cytoplasmic and contractile protein fractions of the small intestine were unaltered by chronic ethanol feeding (p less than or equal to 0.853). In mature rats, the synthesis rates of corresponding fractions declined, by 18% and 31%, respectively, but were also not statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.369). Absolute rates of protein synthesis in immature rats fell by 6% (p = 0.549) in the cytoplasmic and 31% in the contractile protein fraction (p = 0.045). In mature rats, the corresponding reductions were 38% (p = 0.106) and 48% (p = 0.033), respectively. Virtually no radioactivity could be detected in the stromal fraction, signifying very low synthesis rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mucosal histology, crypt cell proliferation and brush border enzymes were measured in rats with varying degrees of jejunoileal bypass, in order to compare the effect of systemic and luminal factors on adaptive growth and differentiation (brush border enzymes) in small intestinal epithelium. Eighty five percent jejunoileal bypass caused a functional short gut; in intestine remaining in continuity there were significant increases in segmental weight, villus area and crypt depth, compared with sham operated controls and 25% jejunoileal bypass rats. Despite villus cell hyperplasia in 85% bypass rats, mucosal sucrase and alkaline phosphatase fell in jejunum and remained low in ileum, while leucine amino peptidase rose in ileum. There was a significant fall in villus area (p less than 0.01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0.001) in self emptying loops of 25% bypass rats not exposed to luminal contents compared with control segments of sham operated rats. In contrast, self emptying loops of 85% bypass rats were not atrophied despite the much greater distance from luminal nutrients; the villus area (p less than 0.01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0.005) were higher than in 25% bypass rats, and at least as great as in sham operated rats. These results indicate that adaptive hyperplasia has a variable effect on expression of brush border enzymes which might reflect villus cell immaturity. The atrophic effect of diversion of luminal contents can be counteracted by systemic growth factors released as part of the adaptive response; thus systemic growth factors are not dependent on a permissive effect of luminal contents.\r"

Endoscopy revealed no corresponding decrease in ileal inflammation, which in all cases persisted after treatment. The phospholipase A2 activity in the ileal mucosa was not altered by prednisolone.

Five hundred and sixty eight patients (36%) had total colitis at diagnosis, 603 patients (38%) left sided colitis, and 397 patients (25%) proctitis. During a median period of observation of 13 years 514 patients were treated by colectomy. The five, 10, and 25 year cumulative colectomy rate were 20% (CI 18-22%), 28% (CI 26-30%), and 45% (CI 41-49%) respectively. The main factor affecting the colectomy rate was the extent of disease at diagnosis. Patients with total colitis showed a five, 10, and 25 year cumulative colectomy rate of 32% (CI 28-36%), 42% (CI 38-46%), and 65% (CI 58-72%) respectively. Ten per cent of the 1586 patients had a colectomy during the first year after diagnosis, 4% during the second year and 1% during subsequent years. The age at diagnosis and sex did not affect the cumulative colectomy rate. Elective colectomy was performed in 322 cases (63%) and acute colectomy in 192. The duration of disease before colectomy fell during the study period due to a more standardised criteria for colectomy in severe attacks. One hundred and twenty nine (66%) of the acute colectomies were performed within two years from diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the results of transproctoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of rectal lesions. Fifty one consecutive patients referred with a presumptive diagnosis of rectal mass were subjected to proctoscopic examination when fine needle aspiration cytology, brush cytology and biopsy samples were taken. Of the 30 patients of malignancy of rectum in whom all the three sampling techniques were applied, the biopsy was positive in 27 (90%), brush cytology in 25 (83.3%) and fine needle aspiration cytology in 29 (96.6%). A combination of fine needle aspiration cytology with brush cytology gave a positive yield in 96.6% while that fine needle aspiration cytology with brush cytology gave a yield of 100%. Fine needle aspiration cytology was most helpful in infiltrative tumours. All 10 patients with secondaries in the pouch of Douglas or rectovesical pouch, and the single patient with submucosal rectal carcinoma were correctly diagnosed at fine needle aspiration cytology. There were no false positive results with fine needle aspiration cytology and no complications were encountered with the procedure.\r"

Methods included the measurement of portal pressure (WHVPG) in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, morphological assessment by semiquantitative grading of severity of disease, calculation of hepatocyte size indices, and assessment of volume density of hepatocytes, sinusoids, Disse's space and Disse's space collagen by electron microscopy. The wedged hepatic venous pressure gradient increased with progression of disease and portal hypertension was present before histologically detectable cirrhosis had developed. With increasing progression of disease towards cirrhosis, the relationship between individual and aggregated features and the WHVPG diminished and lost statistical significance. Hepatocyte size increased with progression of histological changes and correlated significantly with increase of WHVPG, both in non-alcoholic and alcoholic patients. Disse's space collagen was increased significantly in non-alcoholic chronic active hepatitis compared with patients with near-normal liver. No significant decrease of sinusoidal space was found. Multiple factors rather than any single feature influence the development of portal hypertension.\r"

Whole blood bismuth concentrations rose to 880 micrograms/l and he developed global cerebral dysfunction with hallucinations, ataxia, and an abnormal EEG. Renal clearance of bismuth rose from 0.24 to 2.4 ml/min when the heavy metal chelator 2-3 dimercapto-1 propane sulphonic acid (DMPS) was given by mouth. Bismuth was measured by a novel method involving inductively coupled plasma source mass spectrometry. Fifty days after stopping TDB, whole blood bismuth concentrations fell to 46 micrograms/l and the patient's EEG returned to normal. His mental function also recovered completely. The case serves as a timely reminder that TDB should not be administered to patients with renal disorders, as stated in the data sheet.\r"

Some corporations even send company advocates to Washington, DC, to track and influence health care policymaking. What exactly do these corporate leaders want? They are not all in agreement about the degree of government involvement that is necessary or desirable. Nevertheless, they do have strong opinions about delivery of health care at the local level.\r"

In contrast to PL's of migraine patients, all PL's of control persons were normally distributed. In 6 migraine patients (2 with basilar migraine) PL's were pathologically delayed. Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in regard to PL's and IPL's between migraine patients and controls. However, side differences of all peaks (except peak IV,VI) were significantly increased in migraine patients as compared to controls.

In the patients an increased number of strong short-lasting interhemispheric asymmetries was found. In the serial recordings performed, pathologic recordings were obtained intermittently, usually with complete normalisation in the following session. The incidence of abnormalities was relatively independent of the interval between the recording and attack, except for the next few hours.

Further, positive correlations were found between palliative and avoidant stress coping strategies versus headache intensity.

The size of the gap ranged from nine to twenty-four centimeters. The average time until union ranged from ten to twenty months. The ipsilateral fibula was used in thirty-six patients and both fibulae, in the remaining sixteen patients. Immediate reimplantation and adequate fixation of the fibular graft to the proximal and distal ends of the bone to be grafted, along with placement of a cuff of cancellous bone at the host-graft junction and between the fibular struts, fostered early union of the graft to the host bone. Insertion of Kirschner wires inside these long grafts helped to maintain continuity of the graft when a stress fracture occurred. Eight patients who had a non-union at one of the host-graft sites and three who had a stress fracture had subsequent cancellous bone-grafting to obtain union. Superficial infection was the most common complication and was seen in seventeen patients.\r"

To avoid injury to intrapelvic structures, which are not visible to the surgeon during placement of the screws, cadavera were studied to define the location of these structures with respect to fixed points of reference within the acetabulum. Four clinically useful acetabular quadrants were delineated. The quadrants are formed by drawing a line from the anterior superior iliac spine through the center of the acetabulum to the posterior fovea, forming acetabular halves. A second line is then drawn perpendicular to the first at the mid-point of the acetabulum, forming four quadrants. The posterior superior and posterior inferior acetabular quadrants contain the best available bone stock and are relatively safe for the transacetabular placement of screws. The anterior superior and anterior inferior quandrants should be avoided whenever possible, because screws placed improperly in these quadrants may endanger the external iliac artery and vein, as well as the obturator nerve, artery, and vein. The acetabular-quadrant system provides the surgeon with a simple intraoperative guide to the safe transacetabular placement of screws during primary and revision acetabular arthroplasty.\r"

Medially placed screws either penetrated or came dangerously close to the external iliac vein; the obturator artery, nerve, and vein; and tributaries of the internal iliac vein. To avoid injury to the medial vascular structures, screws should not be placed in the anterosuperior quadrant of the acetabulum.\r"

Three hundred and eighty-five hips were followed for at least 9.5 years after replacement. The least amount and rate of linear wear were associated with use of a femoral head that had a diameter of twenty-eight millimeters (p less than 0.001). The greatest amount and mean rate of linear wear occurred with twenty-two-millimeter components, but these differences were not statistically significant. The greatest volumetric wear and mean rate rate of volumetric wear were seen with thirty-two-millimeter components (p less than 0.001). A wider radiolucent line in acetabular Zone 1 was associated with use of the thirty-two-millimeter head. The amounts of resorption of the proximal part of the femoral neck and of lysis of the proximal part of the femur both correlated positively with the extent of linear and volumetric wear; this suggests an association between the amount of debris from wear and these changes in the femoral neck and proximal part of the femur.\r"

Radiolucency at the bone-cement interface adjacent to the tibial component was statistically related to malposition of the tibial component. According to the system of The Hospital for Special Surgery, the mean scores were 64 points preoperatively and 85 points postoperatively. Synovitis recurred in only 3 per cent of the knees. When revision, pain, or radiographic evidence of loosening were considered an indication of failure, the ten-year cumulative survival was 75 per cent.\r"

Comparison revealed that the average transverse and sagittal diameters of the pedicles and the distance from the posterior aspect of the laminar cortex to the anterior aspect of the cortex of the vertebral body along the central axis of the pedicles were 5 to 20 per cent greater in men, but the transverse and sagittal angles of the pedicle did not differ significantly between the sexes. Measurements on radiographs and computerized tomographic scans of the transverse angles of the pedicles and of the distances from the posterior aspect of the laminar cortex to the anterior aspect of the cortex of the vertebral body from the second to the fifth lumbar vertebra were greater than direct measurements, even without magnification.

Four patients remained unable to work. Only two of the twenty-seven who had engaged in sports before they had symptoms resumed their normal sports activity. By the time of admission to the hospital, fourteen patients had decided not to go ahead with the arthroscopy; eight of these had decided to give up sports indefinitely.

The duration of follow-up averaged four years and three months. The preoperative diagnoses were degenerative arthritis, poliomyelitis, talipes equinovarus, and myelodysplasia. Solid fusion was achieved in all patients, although one patient needed reoperation before fusion was achieved. The time to fusion averaged eleven months (range, three to sixteen months).

The base of the ligament's tibial attachment was mechanically isolated with a coring cutter, and a specially designed load-transducer was fixed to the bone-plug that contained the ligament's tibial insertion so that the resultant forces were directly measured by the load-cell. Although the magnitudes of values for forces varied considerably between specimens for a given test condition, the patterns of loading with respect to direction of loading and the angle of flexion of the knee were remarkably consistent. Passive extension of the knee generated forces in the ligament only during the last 10 degrees of extension; at 5 degrees of hyperextension, the forces ranged from fifty to 240 newtons (mean, 118 newtons). When a 200-newton pull of the quadriceps tendon was applied to extend a knee slowly against tibial resistance, however, the force in the ligament increased at all angles of flexion of the knee. Internal tibial torque always generated greater forces in the ligament than did external tibial torque; higher forces were recorded as the knee was extended. The greatest forces (133 to 370 newtons) were generated when ten newton-meters of internal tibial torque was applied to a hyperextended knee. Fifteen newton-meters of applied varus moment generated forces of ninety-four to 177 newtons at full extension; fifteen newton-meters of applied valgus moment generated a mean force of fifty-six newtons, which remained unchanged with flexion of the knee. The force during straight anterior translation of the tibia was approximately equal to the anterior force applied to the tibia. The application of 925 newtons of tibiofemoral contact force reduced the mean force in the ligament that was generated by 200 newtons of anterior pull on the tibia by 36 per cent at full extension and 46 per cent at 20 degrees of flexion.\r"

This angle allowed symptomless and useful function of the extremity. No patient had a stress fracture or discomfort when the arm was at rest at follow-up. An asymptomatic click in the acromioclavicular joint in one patient indicated that this may be a future site of abnormality. The children apparently accommodated easily to the arthrodesis of the shoulder. Neither self-image nor overall function seemed to be impaired by the operation. The over-all function postoperatively was related to the neurological integrity of the distal muscles.\r"

Narrowing of the cartilage space was seen after treatment in a cast in seven (19 per cent) of the thirty-seven hips. In five of these seven hips, this was true chondrolysis; in one, the diagnosis of chondrolysis had been apparent before treatment. Avascular necrosis did not develop as a result of treatment in any patient.

The type of operative procedure was determined by whether the factors limiting motion were purely extra-articular (extrinsic) or whether they included intra-articular (intrinsic) elements as well. The mean preoperative arc of total motion was 30 degrees (from 63 to 93 degrees of flexion). At follow-up examination, twenty-two to ninety-four months post-operatively, of twenty-five patients, the mean arc of total motion was 96 degrees (from 30 to 126 degrees). There were eight complications in seven (27 per cent) of the patients. Of these, four (avulsion of the triceps tendon, deep infection, and two ulnar-nerve paresthesias) were managed by subsequent operative treatment. The other four complications included drainage from a pin site, which resolved after removal of the pin: a three by two-centimeter skin slough, which spontaneously epithelialized; aseptic resorption of the distal end of the humerus and proximal end of the ulna, which stopped after immobilization and subsequent bracing of the elbow but resulted in moderate instability; and ulnar-nerve paresthesia, which was not operatively treated and persisted. Twenty-four (96 per cent) of the twenty-five patients who were followed for twenty-two months or more were satisfied with the results of the procedure because of the improved facility in carrying out activities of daily living. No patient had increased pain, but two had moderate instability. It was concluded that the results of distraction arthroplasty can be gratifying, but the technique is demanding and the rate of complications is high.\r"

The time-related profile of the implantation response was studied in 20 patients who underwent heart-lung transplantation between March 1984-March 1987. In 10 operations the donors had intravenous prostaglandin E-1 pretreatment while 10 had no vasodilatation before explantation of the organs. Otherwise lung preservation and early (2 weeks) immunotherapy were similar in both groups. The implantation response was evaluated by chest films and postoperative lung functions and mechanics. Roentgenographic implantation response was evident from the first postoperative day, was less evident at the seventh postoperative day and then gradually increased during the second postoperative week. There was a tendency towards less implantation response in the PGE-1 group than in the control group, but no statistical difference was observed. Patients with severe operative bleeding problems were excluded from the study. Only peak inspiratory pressures were significantly higher in the control group than in the PGE-1 group (p less than 0.01). Other lung function studies (alveolar-capillary pO2 difference, extubation time) were not different in the groups. This study supported the hypothesis that prostaglandin E-1 may have salutary effects on graft preservation and implantation response in heart-lung transplantation. Since 1986, we have performed 16 heart-lung transplantations using graft preservation with PGE-1 and flush perfusion. Thirty-day mortality is 0% and 13 of 16 patients are surviving.\r"

Good results were obtained if at six months after surgery pain at rest was absent, ischemic ulcers had healed, and there were no major amputations. Seventy-seven percent of all limbs with a preoperative AAI greater than or equal to 0.3 had a good outcome in contrast to 94% failure for index less than 0.3 (p = .000000477). Sixty-nine percent of all limbs with PBI greater than or equal to 0.7 had a good outcome vs. 52% if index less than 0.7 (p = 0.199).

Atrial fibrillation was associated in 38 percent and mitral valve calcification in 24 percent. The hospital mortality was 6.3 percent. Only 1 patient developed severe mitral regurgitation requiring emergency valve replacement. Early postoperative embolism occurred in only 1% of those who were in atrial fibrillation and had preoperative anticoagulation. Long-term results indicate an 85.6 percent survival at the end of 24 years with a very low incidence of restenosis. Late death occurred in 4.6%. These findings support our continuing experience and impression that closed transventricular valvotomy remains the most effective palliative operation in the treatment of most patients with mitral stenosis. With the increasing need for cost containment in health care, this technique of closed transventricular valvotomy assumes even greater importance.\r"

Chronic stable angina was the most consistent presenting symptom in 71% and 49% had at least one myocardial infarction in the past. Fifty percent were hypertensive and 26% diabetic. Left main stem coronary artery obstruction was evident in 21.6% and the coronary arteries diffusely diseased in 53%. An average of 3.8 +/- 0.4 grafts were performed per patient using reversed saphenous vein, and endarterectomies were necessitated in 27.1%. The small calibre of coronary arteries in Asian patients was reflected by 54% of grafted vessels having a luminal diameter of 1.5 mm. The early mortality rate and the peri-operative myocardial infarction rate was 1.2% in each instance. A mean follow-up of 30 months revealed a late mortality of 1.9% and 76% of patients were in NYHA Functional Class I.

The plaques were evaluated histopathologically for the presence of multiple hemorrhages. The data were analyzed using the chi 2 test. Multiple hemorrhages were noted in 60.4% and single or not hemorrhage in 39.6% of patients with hemispheric symptoms. In patients with nonhemispheric symptoms, 9.4% had multiple hemorrhages and 90.6% has single or no hemorrhages; 89.4% plaques with multiple hemorrhages had stenosis greater than 75% in contrast to 37.5% in plaques with single or no hemorrhage; and 62.5% with single or no hemorrhage had stenosis of less than 75% (p less than 0.001). In patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, 80.1% of plaques with multiple hemorrhages were removed, in contrast to 19.7% from patients not receiving antiplatelets (p less than 0.001). In conclusion: Multiple intraplaque hemorrhages were seen more often in patients with hemispheric symptoms and are associated with more critical carotid stenosis. Preoperative antiplatelet therapy increases the incidence of repeated plaque hemorrhages; therefore, we question the validity of this therapy in certain patients with carotid disease.\r"

Ages at the time of surgery ranged from 3 months to 18 years, with a median age of 18 months. Factors that most affected mortality and morbidity were associated cardiac defect, the year of the operation and the age of the patient. Of the 69 patients, 26 (38%) had complex d-TGA. Early post-operative mortality was 2.38% for patients with simple transposition and 22% for the complex group. All early deaths occurred in the early part of series. Ten consecutive cases with complex transpositions in the late part of the series have done well. There were 5 late deaths--4 from the early series and these had complex transposition. Postoperative non-fatal complications included arrhythmia which occurred in 6 patients (9%). The rhythm abnormality was temporary in 2 and permanent pacing was required in 2 other patients (2.9%). There were 3 cases of late caval obstruction and 4 cases of late pulmonary venous obstruction--six of these seven patients were less then 12 months of age. Postoperative renal failure occurred in patients in the early series but was not seen in the late series. Three children developed postoperative pulmonary edema due to large bronchial collateral arteries and underwent successful collateral vessel ligation subsequent to the Mustard operation. Two patients have demonstrated late tricuspid regurgitation, are presently in heart failure and may need valve replacement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty nine underwent elective surgery (Group III). Renal pulmonary and cardiac disease are frequent in octogenarian patients. The surgical repair consisted of 40 knitted bifurcated grafts and 16 aorto-aortic woven grafts. The overall in-hospital mortality rate is high (28.5%: 16 patients) essentially in \"emergency\" surgery: 71% for the seven Group I patients and 45% for the twenty Group II patients. The in-hospital mortality rate of 6.9% for the Group III of \"elective\" procedure is higher than the mortality rate of patients of all ages operated on for asymptomatic AAA in our institution which is 4.3%. Once a patient has been operated on successfully his life expectancy tends to parallel that of a normal population for his age group. These results can be improved with preventive measures such as elective surgery for asymptomatic AAA with a diameter of 6 cm or more. Operative contraindications are severe congestive heart failure, advanced pulmonary disease or neoplastic disease. The age \"per se\" is not a contraindication to aneurysmectomy. Physiologic rather than chronologic age should determine the selection for AAA in the over-80 age group. CT scans and MR are safe fast and non-invasive preoperative examinations for AAA.\r"

  ".W": "When performing an aortobifemoral bypass, the surgeon may choose between an end-to-end or end-to-side aortic anastomosis. Although several authors have claimed the superiority of the former, controversy still exists. The aim of this study was to compare the early and late results of these two techniques in patients for which both procedures were possible. Of 158 patients, aortic anastomosis was performed end-to-end in 47 (group I) and end-to-side in 111 (group II). Both groups were similar in all other aspects. The type of proximal anastomosis did not affect the rate of perioperative mortality or early thrombosis. There were no secondary aortic aneurysms or aortoenteric fistulae in either group. Actuarial primary (without reoperation) and secondary (after thrombectomy) five year patency rates were 90.2 and 98.9 per cent in group I, and 90.8 and 98.5 per cent in group II, respectively. Five-year limb survival was 95.3 and 95.7 per cent, respectively. As we could not find any difference between the results in the two groups, we suggest choosing the simplest procedure which maintains adequate pelvic and colonic blood supply, according to angiographic findings.\r"

  ".W": "Aortoenteric and aortic paraprosthetic fistulae are devastating complications. Most authors recommend total excision of the graft and revascularization of the lower extremities by extra-anatomic bypass. We reviewed the University of Pittsburgh experience with these fistulae in 15 patients between 1977 and 1987. There were 9 aortoenteric fistulae (AEF) and 6 paraprosthetic fistulae (PPF). Seven of the 9 AEF had no abscess surrounding the graft, but communication of the intestine with the aortic anastomosis. One patient died during operation. Six patients underwent a local repair or in situ replacement of the graft. All 6 of those patients survived operation without limb loss. Two of the 9 patients with AEF had evidence of graft infection and underwent total excision of the graft and extra-anatomic reconstruction. Both patients died, one of sepsis and one of aortic stump rupture. All 6 patients with PPF had clinical and operative evidence of overt graft infection and underwent total graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Two of these patients died secondary to sepsis. We conclude that AEF, without evidence of graft infection, were safely treated by local repair. Patients with PPF had infected grafts requiring graft removal with significant morbidity and mortality.\r"

All patients were non claudicators and had peripheral Doppler examinations on admission. Five patients experienced more than one separate episode of microembolization involving both extremities. None presented with a history of heart disease or diabetes. Biplanar arteriograms revealed in every case atherosclerotic degeneration of the aorta without any obstructing lesions and anatomical arterial continuity between the aorta and the site of distal embolization. Three patients who refused operation, were treated conservatively, with a combination of dipyridamole plus aspirin. Three other patients had surgical repair of their atheromatous infrarenal aorta: in two cases thromboendarterectomy was performed, and in the other a Dacron bifurcated graft interposition. No amputations resulted in the patients treated medically, but one of the surgical group lost one toe. This study confirms that atherothrombotic microembolism from an ulcerated atherosclerotic aorta is a potential threat to the extremities and indicates that the optimal therapy for this syndrome has yet to be found.\r"

Segments of vein were obtained from 85 patients undergoing a stripping operation for varicose veins. The venous segments were immersed in a dimethylsulfoxide 15% solution, deep frozen at -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen and preserved for a duration of 1 week to 24 months. Light microscopy (n = 126) failed to demonstrate striking differences between control veins and any of the cryopreserved veins. The types of damage observed at scanning electron microscopy included endothelial cell separation, endothelial cell loss, exposed basement membrane and exposed fibrillar collagen, which were graded on a scale. The score for short term (less than 3 weeks) stored veins was 8.1 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SEM) and did not differ from the long-term (greater than 10 weeks) stored veins score (6.3 +/- 1.0, p NS). The tissue enzymes LDH, GOT, GPT, CPK were measured in the frozen vein groups (n = 115) after thawing to room temperature. Cryopreservation did not alter any of the tissue enzymes measured when compared to controls. Endothelial fibrinolytic activity (FA) of 58 venous segments cryopreserved for a mean duration of 20 months was 6136.4 +/- 292.1 Tissue Activator Units (TAU) and did not differ from FA of 11 controls (5989.1 +/- 696.8 TAU). Synthesis of 6-Keto-PGF1-alpha-2, a stable breakdown product of PGI2, measured in 10 venous segments cryopreserved for 10 months, was significantly higher than in 13 veins stored in saline for 12 hours at 4 degrees C (2.8 +/- 0.4 vs 0.4 +/- 0.1 PG ml-1mg-1min-1, respectively; p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is a complication about which very little epidemiologic data have been formally accrued. Therefore, a retrospective analysis was conducted by reviewing the records of 2120 patients in a private practice setting. The overall incidence of telangiectatic matting in our patient population was 16%. To identify risk factors, in-depth comparative analysis of the databases of 160 of the patients who developed telangiectatic matting and a control group of 160 nonmatting patients was performed. Significantly more patients in the matting group were overweight, on hormones during treatment, and had both a family history and a longer duration of spider veins (p less than 0.05). Additionally, the matting group had a significantly higher proportion of people noting onset of their veins after excess hormonal states, relative to before excess hormonal states, than the nonmatting group. Age and excessive standing did not differ significantly between the two groups. The results of this study provide objective, predictive risk factors for the development of telangiectatic matting.\r"

Of 215 sclerotherapy patients, 114 (53%) complained of various painful symptoms involving areas of telangiectasias (vessels 0.1-1 mm in diameter) and varicosities (vessels greater than 1 mm in diameter). In order to determine whether sclerotherapy is effective in reducing leg pain and discomfort, hundreds of patients receiving two or more treatment sessions of compression sclerotherapy with hypertonic saline were surveyed for the pretreatment and post-treatment presence of numerous symptoms associated with telangiectasias and varicosities of the leg. For all symptoms combined, the overall reported relief of pain was 85% (p less than 0.001). Side effects from the treatment were minimal. These results indicate that sclerotherapy for telangiectasias and varicosities is not only a cosmetic procedure but a safe and valuable medical therapeutic modality, highly effective in relieving leg pain and discomfort.\r"

Seven patients with 25 patches of telangiectatic matting after previous sclerotherapy were also treated. Twenty-seven patients with symmetrical telangiectatic patches or a large \"starburst\" telangiectatic flair that could be divided into two separate treatment sites were treated at one site with PDL alone, and at the other site with a combination of PDL followed immediately by sclerotherapy (SCL) with Polidocanol 0.1-0.25 ml per injection site at a concentration of either 0.25%, 0.5%, or 0.75%. PDL treatment is efficacious for both essential telangiectasia and vessels that arise through the phenomena of telangiectatic matting. Sixty-five percent of vessels are completely faded with treatment. PDL alone has a remarkably low incidence of adverse sequelae. Treatment is most efficacious if all vessels larger than 0.2 mm in diameter, especially varicose and reticular feeding veins, are treated first. Treatment results are not affected by vessel location. And post-treatment compression of this type of vessel appears unnecessary. Combination PDL/SCL treatment appears to offer no advantage to sclerotherapy treatment alone and has a significant degree of complications when treatment is limited to red telangiectasia less than 0.2 mm in diameter with the laser parameters utilized.\r"

Twenty young subjects with asthma (mean age, 11.8 years; range, 8.3 to 20.6 years) were selected on the basis that they developed an LAR after bronchial challenge with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. After the LAR occurred, a placebo and fenoterol were administered blindly by a metered-dose inhaler, with an interval of 15 minutes and in alternating, random sequence. At the start of the study, that is, a documented LAR, the two groups of subjects had the same severity of LAR, as expressed by the fall of the FEV1 (mean, -34.5% versus -33.5%). The mean FEV1 of the 10 patients who received placebo first changed only -1.1% (+/- 5.0), whereas after fenoterol, The FEV1 increased by 20.7% (+/- 10.8). In the 10 patients receiving fenoterol first, the mean FEV1 rose by 18.8% (+/- 8.0), whereas the placebo inhalation resulted in a supplementary increase of 3.1% (+/- 7.0). The paired Student's t test between these differences (placebo versus fenoterol) was highly significant (p less than 0.001). Although it was demonstrated in some studies that beta-agonists did not prevent the LAR, the present study demonstrates that the administration of fenoterol can reverse the FEV1 significantly, although it was not reversed completely, during an allergen-induced LAR.\r"

Hymenoptera anaphylaxis is a highly preventable cause of anaphylaxis, but VIT may itself carry a risk potential, with an appropriate 5% reaction during buildup and 1% reaction risk during maintenance VIT. To assess the safety of VIT in pregnancy, we have gathered data from 26 women with 43 pregnancies. All the women were receiving VIT. One woman was stung early in pregnancy with anaphylaxis resulting. Outcome of pregnancy was normal. Thirty-six of the pregnancies ended normally. There were two mild adverse reactions to VIT, neither of which required treatment. One child was born with multiple congenital abnormalities of unknown cause. Since congenital malformations may occur as frequently as one in 40 live births, these data do not suggest a significant increased risk from VIT during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study the migratory function of eosinophil and neutrophil granulocytes from patients with asthma were investigated. Fifty-seven patients with asthmatic disease of varying severity were included. Eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic responses to 5% pooled normal human serum (NHS), 5% allergen-challenge serum, 2.5% zymosan-activated serum, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (10 nmol/L), chemokinetic responses to albumin (2 gm/L) and 5% NHS, and the eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic and chemokinetic activities of serum were investigated. Eosinophils from patients with asthma demonstrated significantly (p less than 0.02) increased chemotactic responses to allergen-challenge serum, zymosan-activated serum, and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, compared with eosinophils from references. The chemokinetic responses to albumin and NHS were increased (p less than 0.01) by eosinophils from the patients who had blood eosinophilia (greater than 400 X 10(6)/L). Sera from the patients with asthma demonstrated raised eosinophil chemotactic activity (p less than 0.001) and raised eosinophil and neutrophil chemokinetic activity (p less than 0.001). The eosinophil chemokinetic activity of serum was correlated to the relative peak expiratory flow rate of the patients (r = -0.43; p less than 0.02). The increased migratory responses were specific for the eosinophils, since the migratory responses of their neutrophils were not altered compared with that of the references. These results suggest that the eosinophils from the patients with asthma had been exposed to a priming mechanism in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the immunologic and clinical status of individuals from a general population with subnormal levels of IgG2, we prospectively studied 37 of 312 blood donors with low IgG2 levels identified among 8015 donors. We examined (1) G2m(23) allotypes, (2) levels of other IgG subclasses and immunoglobulin classes, (3) composition of peripheral leukocyte populations, (4) responses to two carbohydrate antigen vaccines, (5) in vitro secretion of IgG subclasses by isolated lymphocytes after mitogen stimulation, and (6) clinical histories. We found that most (90%) individuals with subnormal IgG2 levels had G2m(23)- allotypes, whereas only 30% of the unselected donors had G2m(23)-. When individuals were separated according to their G2m(23) allotype, we found that IgG2 \"normal\" range for individuals with G2m(23)- allotype is 35% lower than for individuals with G2m(23)+ allotype. Individuals who had G2m(23)- allotype and had IgG2 levels greater than or equal to 0.8 but less than 1.3 gm/L had no other immunologic abnormalities. In contrast, the individuals with G2m(23)+ allotype and with IgG2 levels less than 1.3 gm/L and the individuals with G2m(23)- allotype and with IgG2 levels less than 0.8 gm/L often had additional immunologic abnormalities, including IgA and/or IgG4 deficiency and decreased in vitro expression of IgG2 subclass. None of these individuals had a clinical history remarkable for recurrent infections. Thus, subnormal IgG2 levels interpreted with G2m(23) corrected normal ranges may be a marker of other immunologic abnormalities but taken alone probably have little clinical significance in a general healthy population.\r"

Sera of four different groups of 10 subjects in each group were studied: (1) patients attending an emergency room in Barcelona for an asthma attack on epidemic days, group A, (2) patients attending an emergency room for an attack on nonepidemic days, group B, (3) patients with asthma from other cities, group C, and (4) patients without asthma from Barcelona matched by age and sex with group A, group D. All subjects in group A had IgE to allergens in extracts of various soybean samples. In contrast, only one of the 10 subjects in each of groups B and C and none of those subjects in group D had IgE to uncleaned bean and hull extracts. Radioimmunoassay demonstrated that in sera from patients with asthma during an asthma outbreak reacted primarily to soybean hull and dust extracts. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide and gel electrophoresis thin-layer isoelectrofocusing demonstrated protein bands of 97.4 to less than 14.4 kd and isoelectric point between 6 and 3.5. By Western blot and thin layer isoelectrofocusing/blotted radioimmunoisoelectrofocusing, IgE of patients with asthma during an asthma outbreak reacted weakly to two protein bands of molecular weight ranging from 42 to 21 kd, strongly to glycoprotein bands with molecular weight less than 14.4 kd, and isoelectric point less than 6, which appeared to be the major allergens.\r"

The first subject worked for a pharmaceutical company; the second and third subjects worked at a carpet-manufacturing plant. All three subjects developed symptoms of rhinitis and asthma after the onset of exposure to guar gum. All subjects were atopic and demonstrated mild bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine at the time they were observed. Skin prick tests demonstrated an immediate skin reaction to guar gum. All three subjects had high levels of serum IgE antibodies to guar gum. Specific inhalation challenges in which the three subjects were exposed for short intervals (less than or equal to 4 minutes) to powder of guar gum elicited isolated immediate bronchospastic reactions in two subjects and a dual reaction in the other subject.\r"

We found bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to histamine in 13 (25%) of the children at 7 years of age with 25 (48%) being atopic on skin testing and 15 (29%) having current wheeze, whereas 30 children (58%) had wheezed at some time during this period. BHR was significantly associated with wheeze and atopy at 5 and 7 years of age, but not during infancy. The six children with moderate to severe BHR (provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 less than 0.8 mumol) formed a distinct subgroup with significantly more wheeze and atopy both during infancy and at 5 years of age when these children were compared to children with milder degrees of BHR. The group with moderate to severe BHR also differed significantly from the nonhistamine-reactive group, whereas children with milder degrees of BHR were not significantly different. We conclude that subjects most likely to develop the more severe degrees of BHR during later childhood are children who manifest atopy in infancy.\r"

The patient's serum, but not control sera, contained IgE antibodies reactive to extracts from peaches, guavas, bananas, mandarins, and strawberries in an ELISA. The patient's serum, however, did not demonstrate elevated levels of IgE antibodies to extracts from apples, pears, and nectarines. Adsorption of the patient's serum with extracts from peaches, strawberries, and mandarins resulted in a decline of detectable IgE antibodies to these fruits. Adsorption with extracts from apples and pears had no such effect. These results demonstrate the specificity of the patient's IgE antibodies to selected fruits only. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting revealed a 30 kda of protein that was recognized by the IgE antibodies in the patient's serum. This protein was not present in extracts from pears or apples. Our results highlight the importance of specific allergens in considering acute allergic reactions to individuals exhibiting sensitivity to various foods or fruits.\r"

Sixty-three percent of tests were ordered for the evaluation of abdominal pain, dyspepsia, or esophageal reflux. Of these tests, only 4.8% yielded results of major clinical importance to patient management. The yield for patients greater than 50 years of age was greater than for patients less than 50, 6.9 versus 3.0% (p = 0.04). There was a significant increase in yield with increasing age (chi trend = 11.6, p less than 0.001). Among patients with an indication of esophageal reflux alone (n = 62), there were no patients younger than age 60 with a test result that would significantly affect therapy or outcome. Among patients evaluated for fecal occult blood or weight loss (n = 120), 11.7% of tests ordered showed a finding of major clinical importance. In this group, the yield was higher in those greater than or equal to 50 years of age than in those less than 50, 14.7 versus 6.7%, (p = 0.2). These results indicate that UGIs ordered to evaluate pain or symptoms of esophageal reflux in the absence of bleeding or weight loss rarely yield results that significantly influence therapy. Such patients may be best served by an initial trial of empiric therapy or some other test. The UGI has greatest value when indications for it include bleeding or weight loss.\r"

However, there have been recent reports of deaths in older patients receiving midazolam for sedation. We examined the relative potency of diazepam compared with midazolam as a function of age in two large groups of patients receiving intravenous benzodiazepines for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. While midazolam and diazepam are approximately equivalent before age 60, after age 60 the relative potency of midazolam compared with diazepam increases markedly. The rapid decline in dose necessary to sedate older patients with midazolam may explain deaths occurring in older patients who have received this drug. Until this problem receives definitive study, we advise that diazepam be preferred over midazolam for intravenous sedation in patients over 60.\r"

The varied composition of the immigrant population of southern Israel afforded us an opportunity to investigate the frequency of the disease. The results of a retrospective study (1961-1985) revealed a high mean age-adjusted incidence rate (per 10(5)) in immigrant Indian men (6.5 +/- 2.17) and Indian women (17.2 +/- 5.12). Rates in all non-Indian immigrants were significantly lower: men 2.7 +/- 1.19, women 2.1 +/- 0.24. The relative risk of developing the disease was significantly higher in Indians. The age at diagnosis was lower in Indian women (54.6 +/- 10.4 years) than Indian men and other immigrants (p less than 0.05). The clinical features were similar in all cases. The risk factors in Indian men were not apparent; in women, the indiscrete use of spices might have raised the rate of esophageal cancer. The disease is more frequent in Indian populations in several parts of the world, and vigilance is required on the part of physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Variations in intracellular Ca2+ levels in developing thymocytes are likely to play a major role in both the activation-associated differentiation of thymocytes and in the selection or clonal deletion of cells. Here we examine the role of CD4, CD8, CD2, and CD45 in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels in mature and immature thymocytes. Mature and immature thymocytes, distinguished on the basis of their CD5 expression, were analyzed simultaneously for their ability to mobilize Ca2+ after coaggregation of their CD3/TCR with other thymic surface Ag. Flow cytometric analysis by using Indo-1 showed that coaggregation of CD4, CD8, and CD2 with CD3/TCR clearly enhances a minimal signal delivered via CD3/TCR on immature thymocytes. Coaggregation with class I MHC had no discernible effect. The responsiveness of immature thymocytes correlated strictly with CD3 surface expression, such that loss of responsiveness occurred with reduced CD3 cell-surface density. However, even thymocytes with very low CD3 expression were able to respond to triggering via CD3 under optimal conditions, indicating that the CD3 signal-transducing mechanism is functional on early thymic cells. Intracellular increases in Ca2+ concentrations induced via CD3, could effectively be inhibited by cross-linking of CD45 and CD3 on immature thymocytes. Although triggering via CD2 alone induced a strong Ca2+ flux, prolonged incubation with activating anti-CD2 antibodies made thymocytes refractory to subsequent triggering. Refractoriness was associated with partial loss of surface CD3 and CD3 zeta. Our results indicate that thymic surface Ag are differentially involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels in immature as well as mature thymocytes.\r"

Ag-primed B cells that were gamma-irradiated with 1000r, or less, retained the ability to activate Ts; however, Ag-primed B cells exposed to UV light were not able to do so. gamma-Irradiated and UV-treated Ag-primed B cells both expressed comparable levels of cell-surface IgM, and both localized to the spleen after in vivo transfer; neither could proliferate in vitro in response to mitogens. By contrast, gamma-irradiated primed B cells were still able to synthesize proteins, whereas UV-treated primed B cells could not. These findings suggest that in order for Ag-primed B cells to activate Ts, they must a) express cell-associated IgM (sIgM) antibody bearing the idiotypic determinants of antibody specific for type III pneumococcal polysaccharide, and b) be able to synthesize protein for either the continued expression of sIgM after cell transfer, or for the elaboration of another protein molecule that is also required for the activation of Ts; this molecule does not appear to be Ia Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, functional heterogeneity among Th cells has been recognized. Based on pattern of lymphokine secretion, two mutually exclusive subsets of CD4+ cells have been defined and designated Th1 (secreting IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and Th2 (secreting IL-4 and IL-5). Identification of these subsets was mostly based on the study of long term cultured T cell lines and clones, and little is known about the Th heterogeneity in vivo. In particular, it has been suggested that IL-4 producing cells cannot be detected in vivo or in primary stimulations in vitro unless responder cells had been previously primed. Our data however, indicate that anti-CD3 mediated stimulation can induce T cells isolated from unprimed animals to IL-4 production. An assay system based on the ability of IL-4 to increase Ia expression of B cells present in the environment of activated T cells was found to be more sensitive than detection of secreted IL-4 in the supernatant by conventional bioassays and was used to study IL-4 production by unprimed lymphocytes polyclonally stimulated in vivo and in vitro by anti-CD3 mAb. The results obtained indicate that CD4+ CD8- T cells able to produce IL-4 upon receptor-specific stimulation exist in the preimmune pool of adult animals. Remarkably, these cells can also be stimulated in vivo by treating animals with anti-CD3 mAb, as indicated by the in vivo induction of IL-4 specific mRNA and hyper-Ia expression on B cells. These results indicate that the inability to detect IL-4 in primary cultures is not due to different activation requirements of Th2 cells but may simply result from their lower frequency in unprimed animals.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated the relative contributions of the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of MHC class II molecules in determining the Ag-processing requirements for class II-restricted Ag presentation to T cells. Hybrid genes were constructed to encode a heterodimeric I-Ak molecule in which the extracellular portion of the molecule resembled wild type I-Ak but where the connecting stalk, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of both the alpha- and beta-chain were derived from the class I molecule H-2Dd. Mutant I-Ak molecules were expressed as heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins reactive with mAb specific for wild type I-Ak. Fibroblast and B lymphoma cells expressing either wild type or mutant I-Ak molecules were able to process and present hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and conalbumin to Ag-specific, I-Ak-restricted, T cell hybridomas or clones. The mutant-expressing cells presented native and peptide Ag less efficiently than the wild type-expressing cells, suggesting that the disparity in presentation efficiency was not due to a difference in Ag processing. CD4 interaction was intact on the mutant I-Ak molecules. Presentation of native Ag by mutant and wild type-I-Ak-expressing cells was abolished by preincubation with chloroquine, or after paraformaldehyde fixation. After transfection of a cDNA encoding the gene for HEL, neither mutant nor wild type-I-Ak-expressing cells presented endogenously synthesized HEL to a specific T hybrid. Newly synthesized mutant I-Ak molecules were associated with invariant chain. These data demonstrate the ability of hybrid class II molecules to associate intracellularly with invariant chain and degraded foreign Ag in a conventional class II-restricted processing pathway indicating that the extracellular domains of class II molecules play a dominant role in controlling these Ag-processing requirements.\r"

Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines derived from fetal liver and adult bone marrow were analyzed to delineate the ontogeny of CD2 in the B cell lineage. The results show that onset of CD2 expression correlates with the presence of cytoplasmic mu-chain. Therefore, the earliest CD2+ pre-B cell in the developing B cell population appears to be the classical pre-B cell.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed information was sought on the capacity of purified B6 L3T4+ cells to elicit lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in irradiated class II-different class I-identical (C57BL/6 (B6) x bm 12)F1 hosts. When B6 L3T4+ cells were transferred in small doses (10(5) to 10(6) together with donor bone marrow (BM) cells, the recipients all developed acute lethal GVHD and most of the mice died within 2 wk, probably from gut damage; this syndrome was conspicuous only in mice treated with very heavy irradiation, i.e., 1000 rad. In marked contrast to L3T4+ cells given in small doses, transfer of large doses of B6 L3T4+ cells to heavily irradiated (B6 x bm 12)F1 hosts paradoxically resulted in only limited mortality: most of the recipients survived for greater than 6 mo and manifested little or no evidence of ill health. It is suggested that the capacity of large doses of L3T4+ cells to protect mice against lethal GVHD is a reflection of T helper function: the cellular immunity provided by the donor L3T4+ cells enables the host to repel pathogens entering through damaged mucosal surfaces, with the result that GVHD becomes sublethal. The protective function of L3T4+ cells in the B6----bm 12 combination was only seen in hosts given donor BM. With transfer of donor L3T4+ cells plus host BM, even lightly irradiated recipients died rapidly from hemopoietic failure. Because this syndrome failed to occur in mice given a mixture of donor and host BM, it would appear that L3T4+ cells destroyed host lymphohemopoietic cells by direct cytotoxicity rather than via a bystander effect.\r"

  ".U": "90217500\r", 
  ".W": "Cytokines, especially IFN, have been shown to increase MHC expression above basal levels in many immunologic processes, but their contribution to normal MHC expression is unknown. Environmental stimuli, such as bacterial LPS, may provoke the secretion of cytokines which could influence MHC expression in the normal host. We therefore studied the factors influencing the normal expression of MHC products in mice, by using kidney as a representative nonlymphoid tissue. Considerable variation in MHC expression was observed between otherwise normal individuals by using indirect immunoperoxidase staining and a radiolabeled antibody binding assay. An intact T cell compartment was not necessary for normal levels of expression; in athymic nude mice and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, MHC expression was similar to or greater than that of controls. Neither a course of broad spectrum antibiotics nor genetically determined resistance to LPS influenced the level of normal expression. Mice raised under germ-free conditions, on a chemically defined diet also had similar levels of MHC expression when compared with mice maintained under conventional conditions. However, when germfree mice were placed in a conventional colony, induction of both class I and II MHC products occurred. Thus, although exposure to bacterial flora or other sources of endotoxin was not required for normal MHC expression, a change in flora can up-regulate expression, probably by inducing the secretion of cytokines from non-T cells. Treatment with cyclosporine or anti-IFN antibodies produced, at most, a small reduction in the level of renal MHC expression. Therefore in some mice, a small component of MHC expression may reflect the secretion of cytokines in response to stimuli such as bacterial LPS. However, most MHC expression in nonlymphoid tissues is constitutive and independent of a physiologic IFN response.\r"

  ".W": "The anterior chamber of the eye is an immunologically privileged site in which allografts survive longer than at other body sites. In this regard, it is relevant that aqueous humor (AH) inhibits lymphocyte proliferation. In order to analyze AH for specific substances that inhibit thymocyte proliferation, samples of human AH, murine AH, and rhesus monkey AH were added to cultures of thymocytes stimulated by IL-1 or IL-2 in the presence of PHA. All samples of AH tested had potent inhibitory activity on thymocyte proliferation in this system. Inhibitory activity was lost by heating AH to 80 degrees C for 1 h. Dialysis of murine AH indicated that species smaller than 3500 Da were capable of mediating this activity; we have termed the factor(s) responsible for this \"small inhibitory factor(s) of AH.\" Retentate, containing species larger than 3500 Da, retained inhibitory activity, but less than nondialyzed AH. Assays for PGE2 demonstrated that murine and human AH contained small quantities of PGE2. These quantities were insufficient to inhibit thymocyte proliferation in our assay system. Furthermore, AH from mice treatend with indomethacin had full inhibitory activity. Assays for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) after acid activation demonstrated significant quantities of latent TGF-beta within human and murine AH which could be largely neutralized by antisera to TGF-beta. Active TGF-beta \"activity\" was also present without acid activation in samples of AH at a level approximately 20% that of latent TGF-beta. However, most of this \"activity\" could not be neutralized by antisera to TGF-beta. AH contains factors capable of limiting thymocyte proliferation.\r"

The inhibitory effects of the soluble receptors were found to be highly specific in that sIL-4R had no effect on IL-1-induced B cell activity and sIL-1R had no effect on IL-4 activity, further demonstrating the existence of two independent pathways of B cell activation directed by IL-1 and IL-4.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently described a 40-kDa protein in peritoneal fluid that neutralized the chemotactic activity of the C fraction C5a. It was deficient in peritoneal fluids of patients suffering from familial Mediterranean fever. Further characterization of the inhibitor with the use of 125I-rC5a binding to dibutyryl cAMP-induced U937 cells revealed dependence on the peritoneal fluid concentration, on the time of incubation and on temperature and pH. Fractionation of 125I-C5a on Sephadex G-50 column, before and after incubation with peritoneal fluid, revealed similar fractionation patterns despite loss of biologic activity of the treated C5a (but not its binding to polyclonal anti-C5a antibody). Analysis of rC5a by SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with partially purified C5a inhibitor, revealed slight modification of the inhibitor-treated C5a. Using various protease inhibitors (i.e., PMSF) suggested that the C5a inhibitor is a serine protease. It neutralized C5a by means of limited proteolysis which did not change C5a immunologic properties and changed only slightly its m.w. but abolished its receptor binding and chemotactic functions. It is suggested that the C5a inhibitor plays a role in the regulation of inflammation in serosal tissues and that its deficiency in familial Mediterranean fever may explain the attacks of sterile inflammation characteristic of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Fc gamma R expressed by mouse mast cells were characterized as functional binding sites, as membrane proteins, and as products of the two genes known to encode murine Fc gamma RII. Peritoneal mast cells, bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), and the mastocytoma cells P815 were found to bear trypsin-resistant, 2.4G2+, low-affinity receptors binding mouse monoclonal IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, i.e., Fc gamma RII. BMMC and P815 Fc gamma RII appeared as heterogeneous membrane proteins that, when deglycosylated, had m.w. corresponding to those of the three known products of the alpha and beta Fc gamma R genes, and differed by their respective contents in BMMC and P815 cells. Heterogeneous Fc gamma R transcripts were also found in BMMC and in P815 RNA. P815 cells contained alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 Fc gamma R transcripts, whereas BMMC contained alpha and beta 1 Fc gamma R transcripts. These data disclose an unexpected molecular heterogeneity of murine mast cell Fc gamma R. Although they appear as a single population of receptors when viewed by external ligands, mast cell Fc gamma R comprise three Fc gamma RII subtypes, encoded by the three known transcripts of the alpha and beta Fc gamma R genes, and differing by their intracytoplasmic portion. The different distributions of Fc gamma RII transcripts and corresponding Fc gamma RII subtypes in different types of mast cells may be determinant for triggering the various biologic activities of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "The first step in infection of human mononuclear cells with HIV involves the high affinity binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to the cell-surface receptor, CD4. To gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction, we have analyzed the ability of gp120 to bind to a panel of 40 mutant CD4 proteins containing single or double amino acid substitutions. In addition, the binding of several anti-CD4 mAb to the mutant CD4 proteins was measured. These mAb were chosen on the basis of the previous demonstration that they bind to epitopes in CD4 adjacent to the gp120-binding site. This analysis permits discrimination between mutations that probably cause localized conformational changes and those that alter residues likely to make direct contact with gp120 and with the mAb. Our results indicate that gp120 from two different strains of HIV binds to a larger region of the CD4 protein than previously described. The data has also been used to map the epitopes of mAb previously identified as anti-idiotype vaccine candidates. The results have important implications for the development of CD4-based therapies for AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "90217517\r", 
  ".W": "Inability of the membrane attack complex of C (C5b-9) to efficiently lyse E from the same species has been attributed to one or more membrane-associated proteins that are collectively called homologous restriction factors. These include a 65,000 Mr protein referred to as the C8 binding protein or homologous restriction factor and a 20,000 Mr protein referred to as P-18, HRF20, CD59 Ag, or MIRL. Both are found on nucleated cells as well as E and both protect against complement-mediated lysis by interfering with C8 and/or C9 function within C5b-9. The exact mechanism by which these factors restrict activity is unknown but studies with purified C8 binding protein suggest they may interact specifically with the gamma subunit of C8. To determine directly if gamma is the target of restriction factors, a derivative of human C8 lacking this subunit was evaluated for its potential to lyse homologous cells. This derivative (C8') was previously shown to be functionally equivalent to normal C8 in a heterologous sheep E system. Here, it is compared to normal C8 by using human E as target cells. Results indicate no difference between the ability of C8 and C8' to incorporate into HuEAC1-7, to mediate subsequent C9 binding and to promote hemolysis. Thus, the presence or absence of gamma has no effect on homologous restriction of C5b-9, therefore gamma cannot be the primary target of homologous restriction factors.\r"

  ".W": "In the present report, we further explored the mechanisms by which 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (paf-acether), a phospholipid mediator of inflammation inhibited PHA-induced CD4+ cell proliferation. Evidence was obtained that CD4+ cells stimulated with either PHA or immobilized OKT3 in the presence of paf at concentrations that block CD4+ cell proliferation, exhibited a marked decrease in high affinity IL-2R expression. Importantly, paf did not prevent the binding of IL-2 to its receptor. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that paf caused more than 50% decrease in the number of IL-2 high affinity sites per cell, whereas the receptor ligand affinity remained essentially constant. Moreover, the down-regulation of high affinity IL-2R was also accompanied by a loss of IL-2-dependent proliferative capacity. Together these data suggest that decreased expression of high affinity IL-2R may contribute to the diminished proliferative activity observed in CD4+ cells stimulated with PHA or immobilized OKT3 in the presence of paf. They further emphasize the potential role of lipid proinflammatory mediators such as paf in the regulation of T cell activation.\r"

Antisera were analyzed for reactivity with crude worm extract, excretory/secretory proteins and cuticle proteins from L1 larvae. The response was biphasic; antibodies against one set of Ag were detected 13 days after infection (group I Ag), and antibodies against a different set of Ag were detected 35 days after infection (group II Ag). Excretory/secretory and cuticle proteins were recognized only by antibodies produced late in infection. The predominant isotype in day 42 antiserum was IgG1, and 80% of these IgG1 antibodies reacted with a stage-specific determinant shared by virtually all group II Ag. A mAb reactive with the shared determinant was used to purify the group II Ag from L1 larval extract. Such affinity-purified Ag were protective when used to immunize mice against subsequent infection, and T cells from infected mice proliferated when cultured with these Ag in vitro. Other mouse strains also made a strong serum antibody response to the group II Ag. We hypothesize that immune responses to the shared epitope play an important role in determining the outcome of the host-parasite interaction during infection.\r"

  ".W": "Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation around the tissue-invasive stages of several species of helminths have been observed. Release of eosinophil granule contents upon the worms is supported by localization of two of the major granule proteins, major basic protein (MBP) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), on and around species of trematodes, nematodes, and cestodes. In the case of filarial worms, MBP is deposited on degenerating microfilariae (mf) of Onchocerca volvulus. Here, we performed in vitro assays of the toxicity of four purified eosinophil granule proteins, namely, MBP, EPO, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), for the mf of Brugia pahangi and Brugia malayi. MBP, ECP, and EDN killed these worms in a dose-related manner although relatively high concentrations of EDN were necessary. EPO, in the presence of a H2O2-generating system and a halide, was the most potent toxin on a molar basis; here, the most potent halide was I- followed by Br- and Cl-. Surprisingly, EPO in the absence of H2O2 killed mf at concentrations comparable to those required for MBP and ECP. The toxicity of EPO + H2O2 + halide was inhibited by heparin, catalase, or 1% BSA, whereas the toxicity of EPO alone was inhibited only by heparin. Heparin also inhibited killing by both MBP and ECP. Despite the homology of ECP with certain RNases, placental RNasin, an RNase inhibitor, was unable to inhibit ECP-mediated toxicity. These results indicate that all of the eosinophil granule proteins are toxic to mf and they support the hypothesis that eosinophil degranulation causes death of mf in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Two viral epitopes (C3 neutralization epitope from poliovirus type 1 and the 132-145 peptide from the PreS2 region from hepatitis B virus) have been expressed in the Escherichia coli periplasm as protein fusion with the maltose binding protein (MalE protein). Immunization of mice with live bacteria expressing the foreign viral epitopes in their periplasm elicited high antibody titers against the viral peptide as well as against the corresponding virus. This demonstrates for the first time in the case of defined epitopes that, when live bacteria are used as immunogens, presentation at the cell surface is not a prerequisite to obtain an antibody response. On the other hand, the induction of antiviral antibody responses by these recombinant bacteria depended dramatically on the route of immunization: a response was induced by live bacteria through the i.v. route but not through the s.c. route. However, when bacteria were heat killed or when the MalE hybrid protein was released under a soluble form from the cell, a response was induced even upon s.c. immunization. From these results, we suggest that in order to induce high levels of antibodies by the s.c. route, a major parameter for bacterial Ag would be their capacity to be released into a soluble form before the interaction of the bacteria with the APC. This would permit the presentation by B cells rather than by phagocytic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the route of immunization influences the isotypic distribution and the neutralizing activity of the antipoliovirus antibodies. Such results may have major implications for the development of bacterial vaccines based on fusion proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90217531\r", 
  ".W": "It is known that anti-dengue virus antibodies at subneutralizing concentrations augment dengue virus infection of IgG FcR (Fc gamma R)-positive cells, and this phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement. This is caused by the uptake of dengue virus-antibody complexes by Fc gamma R. We previously reported that Fc gamma RI can mediate antibody-dependent enhancement. In this study we use an erythroleukemia cell line, K562, which has Fc gamma RII, but does not have Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RIII, to determine if Fc gamma RII can mediate infection by dengue virus-antibody complexes. Polyclonal mouse anti-dengue virus antibody significantly augments dengue virus infection of K562 cells, whereas normal mouse serum does not. A mAb IV.3, which is specific for Fc gamma RII and is known to inhibit the binding of Ag-antibody complex to Fc gamma RII, inhibits dengue antibody-mediated augmentation of dengue virus infection. It has been reported that Fc gamma RII binds to mouse IgG1, but not to mouse IgG2a. A mouse IgG1 anti-dengue virus mAb (3H5) augments dengue virus infection of K562 cells, but a mouse IgG2a anti-dengue virus mAb (4G2) does not. 4G2 augments dengue virus infection of a human monocytic cell line, U937, which has Fc gamma RI. Based on these results we conclude that Fc gamma RII mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in addition to Fc gamma RI.\r"

Although exposure of T cells to anti-CD28 mAb does not activate T cells, stimulation of CD28 can synergize with signals transmitted through the TCR or other stimuli to augment proliferation and lymphokine production. We have used a portion of the human CD28 cDNA to isolate a homologous murine cDNA from an EL4 T lymphoma library. The murine clone has 61% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA. Both human and murine sequences exhibit homology with members of the Ig supergene family and CTLA-4, a T cell specific murine gene. Many characteristics of the human CD28 molecule are conserved within the putative murine CD28 polypeptide. The murine cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 218 amino acids that has 68% identity with the human sequence. Both the murine and human molecules are integral membrane glycoproteins with hydrophobic signal peptide sequences and transmembrane region. All five potential N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved and six of the seven cysteine residues of the mouse protein are found in the human CD28 polypeptide. The murine cDNA is encoded by a single copy nonrearranging gene whose expression at the mRNA level is restricted to T cells. A rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic portion of the translated murine cDNA sequence. This antiserum identifies an 80-kDa homodimer consisting of disulfide-bonded subunits of 40 kDa that is expressed on splenic T cells, thymocytes, and several T cell tumors, but not on B cells. deglycosylation studies indicate that four of the five N-linked glycosylation sites are used and that the mature core protein has a molecular mass of 25 kDa, close to that predicted by the cDNA sequence. Transfection of the murine cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in the expression of an 80-kDa dimeric molecule that was immunoprecipitated by the antipeptide antiserum. Taken together, these data provide strong support that we have identified the murine homologue of CD28.\r"

In this study, we have examined laser-induced phototoxicity in normal human skin fibroblasts and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells incubated with aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS) in vitro. The culture, laser, and photosensitizer parameters were varied in attempts to establish the conditions for differential cytotoxicity between normal and malignant human fibroblasts. Biochemical assays, as a measure of cytotoxicity, included [3H]thymidine incorporation (an index of DNA replication), [35S]methionine incorporation (a measure of protein synthetic activity), and the MTT assay (an indirect index of mitochondrial activity). In the absence of laser irradiation, AlPcS was non-toxic to both cell lines in concentrations up to 25 micrograms/ml. Laser light alone at 675 nm (the absorption maximum of AlPcS) had no effect on the cells at energy densities up to 16 J/cm2. In the presence of 3 or 10 micrograms/ml of AlPcS, both cell lines demonstrated marked energy-dependent toxicity. If an 8-h or a 24-h \"efflux\" period in AlPcS-free medium was allowed to take place prior to laser irradiation, normal fibroblasts were much less sensitive to PDT, whereas fibrosarcoma cells still exhibited a marked degree of toxicity. The results indicate that, under appropriate treatment conditions, AlPcS is capable of preferentially sensitizing a malignant mesenchymal cell line, while sparing its non-malignant normal cell counterpart.\r"

Topical formulations containing either recombinant EGF or placebo were applied daily to partial-thickness wounds along the dorsal surface of pigs. Following full-thickness removal of these wounds, tissues were sectioned and stained, and histologic sections were subjected to computerized morphometric analysis. A significant acceleration of epithelialization across the wound surface was noted following daily EGF treatments. EGF delivered in a variety of topical formulations also produced a marked increase in the cellularity and thickness in the neodermis. A dose-responsive increase in the thickness of the granulation tissue was also observed. In conclusion, topical application of EGF stimulates epithelialization of partial-thickness wounds and produces a positive impact on the underlying dermis during the early phases of wound repair.\r"

  ".U": "90217582\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous studies of the histology of allergic contact dermatitis reactions to potent allergens in guinea pigs and humans have indicated that there is significant tissue infiltration with basophilic leukocytes. In this study we determined whether this histologic finding could be of value in distinguishing weak sensitization reactions from primary irritation, thereby aiding in the predictive identification of weak or moderate contact allergens. Guinea pigs were sensitized by the Buehler test method. Skin reactions were graded 24, 48, and 72 h post-challenge with duplicate patch sites biopsied at the 24- or 72-h grading timepoints. The biopsies were fixed, embedded in glycol methacrylate, thin sectioned, and Giemsa stained. The number of basophils per 400 leukocytes were counted along the upper dermis just below the dermal/epidermal junction. Challenge patch sites from animals sensitized to a relatively low dose of the strong contact allergen, oxazolone, were compared with patch sites from animals challenged only with a strong irritant, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Compared to normal skin (7.5 +/- 1.0 basophils/400 leukocytes +/- SEM) only the oxazolone patch sites showed significant basophil infiltration (36.8 +/- 6.5), despite the fact that the skin reactions to the low oxazolone challenge dose were relatively weak. SLS patch sites showed no basophil infiltration above normal skin levels (4.8 +/- 0.9). Subsequent blinded studies compared weak/moderate presumptive sensitization reactions (as defined by accepted visual skin grading criteria) to various chemicals (citronellal, vanillin, cinnamic aldehyde, and ethylenediamine) to primary irritation reactions to the same chemicals. In each case, low-challenge-dose sensitization sites on previously treated (induced) animals showed mean basophil infiltration (range, 11.9-69.2 basophils/400 leukocytes) significantly greater than higher-dose irritant reactions (range, 1.6-13.3). The range for normal skin was 0.2-10.2 and the range for strong patch reactions to higher concentrations of oxazolone was 59.8-209.3. These data strongly indicate that light-microscopic quantitation of the CBH response can be used to distinguish relatively weak to moderate contact sensitization reactions from primary irritation reactions to the same chemicals.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, it was demonstrated that site-specific suppression of T-cell-mediated immune responsiveness could indeed be achieved by topical application of cyclosporine. Evidence for site-specific immune suppression was obtained from a dual skin allograft model in rats. These animals were given an initial 10-d systemic treatment of CsA. Subsequently, one allograft was treated with topical CsA and the other was treated with the vehicle alone. Anti-inflammatory efficacy and prolonged skin allograft survival were observed both grossly and histopathologically in the presence of topically administered CsA, while contralateral vehicle-treated control grafts underwent vigorous rejection. Systemic lymphocyte DNA synthesis following Con-A and PHA stimulation was normal to elevated. Therefore, systemic T-cell-mediated immunity appeared unaffected or possibly activated even with concomitant topical CsA treatment. CsA levels were low systemically, and showed relative site-specificity in terms of tissue concentration. In conclusion, this study indicates that topical CsA is capable of locally suppressing a strong T-cell-mediated immune response after an initial short-term systemic dose of CsA. Furthermore, certain putative autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the skin, such as psoriasis and eczematous dermatitis, which may share common mechanisms of action compared to skin allograft rejection should likewise benefit from topical CsA treatment.\r"

  ".U": "90217584\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate how cyclosporine A affects antigen-presenting cell subsets and their function in human skin, we studied patients with psoriasis undergoing a therapeutic trial of cyclosporine A. Immunologic parameters abnormal in psoriatic epidermis were evaluated before and early in the course of therapy. We quantitated function and numbers of skin biopsy-derived epidermal cells with potential antigen-presenting cell (APC) activity. The antigen-presenting capacity of epidermal cells from normal-appearing skin to activate allogeneic T cells was profoundly inhibited (81% decrease) 7 d after the onset of therapy (p less than 0.05). Thus, cyclosporine A therapy inhibited T-cell activation mediated by Langerhans cells in uninvolved skin. By contrast, in lesional skin epidermal allo-antigen presenting activity was only partially inhibited at this early time point (55 +/- 7% decrease) (p less than 0.01, n = 8). The percentage decrease in allo-antigen-presenting cell activity correlated with reduced clinical activity of the lesions, r = 0.84. In three patients also examined at 14 d, we found an additional 42 +/- 5% decrease between day 7 and 14. Decreased allo-antigen-presenting activity in lesional skin was not associated with a decrease in the number of CD1+ Langerhans cells or epidermal cell release of detectable amounts of cyclosporine A or other soluble factors that abrogate T-cell alloreactivity. The time course and degree of inhibition of antigen-presenting capacity within involved psoriatic skin correlated best with a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction in non-Langerhans cell DR+ leukocytes (from 3.0 +/- 1.2% to 1.0 +/- 0.6% at day 7) (r = 0.71). Cyclosporine A therapy was associated with a rapid and complete loss of HLe1-DR+ keratinocytes (94% decrease at 7 d) in lesional skin despite the skin still being quite involved with psoriasis at this point and antigen-presenting cell activity being only 60% reduced. In conclusion, cyclosporine A interferes with T-cell activation by human epidermis through at least two mechanisms: 1) in uninvolved skin, rapid inhibition of Langerhans cell-mediated activation of T cells, and 2) in lesional skin, delayed inhibition of antigen-presenting activity which appears to correlate with the time course and level of reductions in non-Langerhans cell DR+ leukocytes. The antigen-presenting activity of the latter cells appears to be cyclosporine A resistant. In psoriatic lesions, early and complete loss of DR expression on lesional keratinocytes during cyclosporine A therapy is likely due to decreased lesional T-cell lymphokine production critical for keratinocyte DR expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The effects of methotrexate (MTX), fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), and hydroxyurea upon cell growth, DNA synthesis, thymidylate synthase activity, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity were compared in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK), newborn epidermal cells (NEC), human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-25), and a methotrexate-resistant human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-15R). Normal keratinocytes were found to be 10(3) to 10(4) times less sensitive to the effects of MTX and FUDR than the malignant cells with respect to growth and DNA synthesis. The differential sensitivity to MTX and FUDR was not due to differences in growth media, increased target enzyme activity, e.g., DHFR and thymidylate synthase, or impaired transport of these drugs. The results indicate that the mechanism for the increased sensitivity of the squamous cell carcinoma to MTX and FUDR must involve a process which is distal to the de novo synthesis of dTMP.\r"

Under conditions in which skin temperature was varied either from 33-43 degrees C or from 33-18 degrees C, it was found that camphor increased the perceived intensity of the cutaneous sensations produced during heating and cooling. Although camphor's effect appeared to be greater during warming, neither effect was large. Camphor also produced a significant increase in the frequency of reports of \"burning.\" It is concluded that camphor is a relatively weak sensory irritant that may have a modest excitatory effect on thermosensitive (and perhaps nociceptive) cutaneous fibers.\r"

Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting studies revealed that LC of adult C57BL/6 mice express PKC II, while PKC I and PKC III were not detected. In keratinocytes, none of the isozymes were detected. These results suggest that PKC II is a novel marker of LC and that it possibly plays a regulatory role in epidermal LC of the mouse in vivo.\r"

Over a 24-h period, unstimulated cultured keratinocytes convert leukotriene B4 to unidentified polar molecules. Leukotriene C4 is converted to a leukotriene D4/leukotriene E4-like product. Cultured human keratinocytes have the ability to metabolize leukotrienes and thus the keratinocyte may play a major role in the in vivo metabolism of leukotrienes produced during inflammatory dermatoses.\r"

In the tissue, however, fibroblasts have also the potential to pass through connective tissue barriers following a chemotactic stimulus. Since tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a cytokine released by mononuclear cells during wound healing, we have been interested in studying its effect on the regulation of fibroblast chemotaxis and invasive migration. TNF alpha did not attract skin fibroblasts nor did it alter their chemotactic response towards other chemoattractants like fibroblast conditioned medium or fibronectin. However, whereas normal skin fibroblasts did not invade a collagen I gel, preincubation of the cells with TNF alpha markedly induced their invasive migration into the gel. This seems to be associated with a specific degradation of type I collagen, because TNF alpha did not promote the invasion of skin fibroblasts through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel).\r"

  ".W": "A detailed dose-response curve has been established for induction of contact hypersensitivity (CH) in mice with trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB). It was determined that in BALB/c, CBA/J, and C57BL/6 mice, the dose required to sensitize via epicutaneous application was between 1 and 10 micrograms TNCB. When doses of hapten of 200 micrograms or greater were painted on abdominal skin, CH responses were induced which were only marginally greater than responses induced by sensitizing doses of hapten in the 10-50-micrograms range, implying that no further dose-response relationship exists beyond 50 micrograms of hapten. However, in companion experiments, in which panels of mice were pretreated with cyclophosphamide, it was determined that sensitizing doses of hapten in excess of 50 micrograms induced both CH and concomitant induction of down-regulation of CH. Thus, at 200 micrograms or higher doses of TNCB, CH responses of cyclophosphamide pretreated mice were invariably more intense than in their untreated, hapten-painted cohorts. In the animals pretreated with cyclophosphamide, it was possible to see that a dose-response relationship continued to exist between the amount of epicutaneously applied hapten over a 200 micrograms to 14 mg range and the intensity of the CH induced. We conclude that the optimal dose for immunizing mice epicutaneously with TNCB is between 10 and 50 micrograms. This is considered optimal since animals sensitized in this manner display no evidence of concomitant down-regulation of their CH responses.\r"

Fibroblast proliferation was blocked when the cells were cultured in the presence of a serum-free culture medium containing epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin, ethanolamine, phosphoethanolamine, and bovine pituitary extract as growth supplements and 0.15 mM Ca++. This level of extracellular Ca++ is lower than that needed to support fibroblast growth. Under these conditions, growth was stimulated by all-trans retinoic acid. Proliferation was also stimulated in the same basal medium without the growth supplements. Growth-promoting concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid ranged from 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml (1.7-6.6 X 10(-6) M). Stimulation of proliferation was not seen at higher or lower concentrations. Concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid that stimulated proliferation also induced increased production of fibronectin as indicated by biosynthetic labeling/immunoprecipitation and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Increased production was associated with increased staining for fibronectin in the extracellular matrix. Increased production of two other non-collagenous extracellular matrix component, i.e., thrombospondin and laminin, also occurred in all-trans retinoic acid-treated cells. At 0.5 micrograms/ml, all-trans retinoic acid also stimulated production of type I collagen by the dermal fibroblasts, but at higher concentrations (2.5 micrograms/ml) production of type I collagen was inhibited. These data indicate that all-trans retinoic acid can induce changes in dermal fibroblasts in vitro (i.e., increased proliferation and extracellular matrix production) that mimic the major changes seen in the dermis after topical treatment with this agent.\r"
