The position of CEA-cross-reacting antigen, especially of nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), was also studied in the case of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For this purpose, both monospecific antibodies to CEA and NCA, as well as cross-reacting antibodies, were used in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. CEA reactivity could not be detected, neither during pancreatic development nor in chronic pancreatitis with or without associated adenocarcinoma. In 15 of 20 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, CEA positivity was found both with membranous and cytoplasmic localization. With the use of the cross-reacting antibodies, all cases of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed positive staining of both ductal and tubular structures. Antibodies to NCA closely mimicked the results obtained with the cross-reacting antibodies both in pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma. From the authors' results it can be concluded that CEA is not a developmental antigen of the pancreas. Furthermore, NCA cross-activity of anti-CEA antibodies is an important reason of false positive reaction in chronic pancreatitis. Moreover, true CEA positivity in the pancreas appears to be restricted to adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas.\r"

The cytologic appearance of two rare monomorphic variants of pleomorphic adenomas is described. The trabecular-tubular adenoma consisted of a trabecular arrangement of uniform small cells with scant basophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei. No mucoid spheres were present. The canalicular adenoma also had a distinctive cytologic appearance consisting of papillae and interconnected canaliculi lined by a layer of columnar epithelium. Monomorphic adenomas have unique morphologic appearances that can be recognized in fine-needle aspiration cytology. Preoperative diagnosis can greatly aid the surgeon in the planning of definitive surgical excision of salivary gland neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Selection of platelets for alloimmunized, thrombocytopenic patients has traditionally been based on HLA matching. This approach is indirect and may not adequately recognize incompatibility between the recipient and the platelet donor. The authors evaluated the usefulness of directly showing donor-recipient compatibility by crossmatching the patient's serum with prospective platelet donors who were not preselected on the basis of their HLA type. Eleven alloimmunized patients were chosen for study, and crossmatching was done by a radiolabeled antiglobulin test. These patients had high levels of HLA alloantibody, and their unusual HLA types made the provision of HLA-matched platelets difficult. When the crossmatch was compatible, the mean one-hour corrected count increment was 18,379 +/- 4,670 (1 standard deviation), n = 22, and at 18-24 hours, 7,318 +/- 3,317. If the crossmatch was positive, the mean one-hour corrected increment was 2,536 +/- 3,057, and at 18-24 hours, 227 +/- 657, n = 16. There were two false negative crossmatches and one false positive crossmatch. One hundred forty-eight crossmatches were done to find 48 potential donors, who, by conventional selection using HLA matching, would not have been considered appropriate donors. These results show that successful platelet transfusions for alloimmunized thrombocytopenic patients can be prospectively selected by platelet crossmatching without the need of doing expensive HLA typing of a large population of platelet donors. Although it may be difficult to find compatible platelets for some patients with broadly reactive HLA antibodies, platelet crossmatching may detect compatible donors who are ordinarily excluded on the basis of their HLA phenotype.\r"

Sixty-nine percent of the carcinomas were found by excision of a local change of tissue visible through close examination by the naked eye. All but one carcinoma were of papillary type, the one exception being a C-cell carcinoma. Multicentricity was found in 46% and regional lymph node metastases in 14%.

Four cases yielded indeterminate results. One complex iron-deficient case was incorrectly classified. This graphic method developed with data from tertiary care patients was correct in 88.4% of cases, incorrect in 2.3%, and indeterminate in 9.3%. When absent iron stores were graphically predicted, the predictive value was 100%. When iron deficiency was graphically excluded, the predictive value was 97%. The authors conclude the graphic method is useful in a community hospital practice for the confirmation or exclusion of iron deficiency.\r"

In the cartilage the pigment deposits were located on and between thick collagen fibrils. In the synovial membrane there were embedded packets of cartilage shards of which the collagen fibrils and pigment were phagocytosed, as well as calcified bone debris whose disaggregation might have explained the presence of some apatite deposits free of any underlying collagen structure. As also previously observed, the present case of ochronotic hip osteoarthrosis is remarkable for the minor osteophyte formation and for the inclusion of pigmented cartilage shards in the osteomedullar remodeled territory. It also demonstrates a collapse of the femoral head cortex presumably related to the rapid clinical and radiologic evolution. By the well-known origin of its chondropathy and by the pigment labeling of the cartilage, ochronotic arthropathy provides an almost experimental model for analyzing a broader problem, i.e., that of the various components of an osteoarthrotic remodeling.\r"

The present study was undertaken to evaluate a rapid, noninvasive method for determination of skin iron by the technique of diagnostic x-ray spectrometry (DXS). Thirty-five patients receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment entered the study and were compared with 25 normal controls. Since pathological skin iron deposition occurs mainly at the dermal-epidermal junction in the basal cells of the epidermis, measurements were made in the thenar eminence representing mainly epidermal tissue (FeE), and in the forearm representative mainly of dermis (FeD). The mean +/- SD FeE iron concentrations were equivalent to 14.5 +/- 8.8 and 18.2 +/- 10.2 parts per million wet weight tissue (ppm) and both were significantly higher than in normal controls in which they averaged 9.2 +/- 2.5 ppm (P less than 0.005) and 10.2 +/- 3.2 ppm (P less than 0.001), respectively. There was significant positive correlation between individual skin iron determinations with the total number of blood transfusions received, the rate of blood transfusion, and with serum ferritin levels. Bone marrow hemosiderin was examined in six patients and showed a similar trend. Despite correlation only with indirect indices of tissue iron, our findings suggest that DXS may serve as a reliable quick method for noninvasive estimation of nonreticuloendothelial tissue iron deposition in hemodialysis patients suspected of having transfusional iron overload. The method may be valuable in monitoring the effects of chelation therapy.\r"

The synthesis of PC by rat lung (positive control), liver (negative control), and transparent mesentery (test tissue) was determined by in vitro incubation of these tissues in the presence of (methyl-14C) choline chloride for three hours at 37 degrees C in Warburg flasks. All lipid material present in tissue and incubation media was extracted by the Folch technique. Carrier egg PC was added to each sample and total PC was isolated using high performance thin-layer chromatography. The PC fractions were counted for total radioactivity. No statistically significant difference was observed between the mean radioactive value for mesenteric tissue compared with lung tissue. The mean radioactive value for liver when compared with mesenteric and lung tissue was significantly lower (P less than 0.001). Thus, under the conditions of the experiment, we have demonstrated for the first time that peritoneal tissue is capable of synthesizing PC in amounts similar to that produced by the lung. Electron microscopy of transparent mesentery (test tissue) showed that mesothelium constituted the bulk of the cell population. Therefore, it is most likely that the PC that has been detected in peritoneal fluid is produced by the mesothelial cell. These findings are of significant relevance to developing concepts on the role of surfactant phospholipids in the physiology of peritoneal dialysis.\r"

As intraperitoneal dwell of hypertonic dialysate was prolonged, the gross and net UFs and ultrafiltration coefficients decreased, and the UF per dextrose absorption declined. The decrement in UF was multifactorial, including a component of fluid and solute stagnation, increasing the distance over which osmotic forces must exert their effects. Excessively hypertonic dialysis fluid should be used only briefly to achieve ultrafiltration efficiently and to avoid the high dextrose loading.\r"

  ".U": "88267248\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Most investigations describing the long-term outcome of large groups of patients with variant angina pectoris have focused on such endpoints as myocardial infarction, coronary artery surgery, and death, and have asked how the risk of these events is related to the severity of existing organic coronary disease. It is also possible to ask what is the relative importance of organic and functional components in causation of symptoms and outcomes, as was done in this study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The early and long-term clinical course was observed in a group of 80 patients with variant angina and a low prevalence of severe organic coronary disease (diameter stenosis greater than 70 percent of one vessel in 28.3 percent, of two or more vessels in 2.7 percent). Patients were seen at the UCLA Medical Center between July 1963 and June 1985. RESULTS: The following observations were made: Compared with those experiencing a first episode of angina at rest, subjects whose first episode of vasospastic angina occurred during strenuous effort were more likely subsequently to have a positive exercise test result and a more stable but long-term anginal course. A good initial response to vasodilator therapy indicated a likelihood of being alive and symptom-free without an intervening myocardial infarction by five years after diagnosis, which was twice the rate as if initial response to such treatment was poor. The presence or absence of severe coronary artery obstruction as detected by angiography could not be predicted from the nature or severity of angina, the historical presence of effort angina, or the occurrence of a positive result on an exercise test. The existence of severe coronary stenosis in at least one vessel was not associated with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or death in the first nine years after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that manifestations of ischemic heart disease in these patients were more directly caused by coronary vasospasm than by the degree of organic coronary obstruction seen by coronary arteriography. In addition, the presence of severe organic stenosis in one coronary artery did not appear to be associated with measurably increased adverse effects on clinical course or survival over the first nine years after diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "88267249\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: As newer non-medical techniques are developed to treat older patients with severe aortic stenosis, reliable noninvasive diagnosis of the condition will become increasingly important. For this reason, the accuracy of multiple noninvasive indexes for quantitation of the severity of aortic stenosis was evaluated, relative to catheterization-determined aortic valve area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the accuracy of multiple noninvasive parameters in assessing the presence and extent of aortic valve narrowing, noninvasive and catheterization correlations of the severity of aortic stenosis were obtained on 121 occasions in 81 patients (mean age, 76 +/- 11 years). Forty patients had studies performed before and after valvuloplasty. Noninvasive studies included the time to one-half carotid upstroke and carotid ejection time, corrected for heart rate, measured from a carotid pulse tracing; M-mode echocardiographic aortic valve excursion; mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve assessed by Doppler technique; the ratio of the peak to mean pressure gradient by Doppler; and Doppler aortic valve area assessed using the following continuity equation: aortic valve area = A X V/V1, where A = left ventricular outflow tract area, V = peak left ventricular outflow tract velocity, and V1 = peak velocity in the aortic stenotic jet. Mean aortic valve gradients and area (calculated using the Gorlin formula) were also assessed at cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: The correlations between the catheterization measurement of aortic valve area and the various noninvasive measurements were as follows: time to one-half carotid upstroke (r = -0.32, p less than 0.001); corrected left ventricular ejection time (r = -0.24, p less than 0.05); aortic valve excursion (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001); mean gradient by Doppler study (r = -0.44, p less than 0.001); mean gradient by catheterization analysis (r = -0.55, p less than 0.001); peak to mean gradient ratio measured by continuous wave Doppler (r = 0.38, p less than 0.001); and aortic valve area assessed using the Doppler continuity equation (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Noninvasive determination of aortic valve area using the continuity equation is an accurate means of assessing the severity of aortic stenosis. Although multiple other noninvasive parameters also correlate with aortic valve area measured at catheterization, there is too much scatter of data points to permit accurate prediction of catheterization aortic valve area in any given patient.\r"

We sought to identify such features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of the charts of 42 consecutive patients with biliary obstruction and/or cholangitis who had received more than three doses of an aminoglycoside. RESULTS: Comparison of patients in whom aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity did and did not develop revealed no differences in age, race, sex, dose, and duration of aminoglycoside therapy; mean peak and trough aminoglycoside levels; initial pre-treatment levels of serum creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, or albumin; or prothrombin time. The initial pre-treatment serum bilirubin level was higher in the patients in whom aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity developed (12.2 +/- 8.8 mg/dl versus 3.4 +/- 3.2 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity occurred in eight patients (19 percent): in seven of 15 patients (47 percent) with an initial bilirubin value greater than 5.0 mg/dl, but in only one of 27 patients (4 percent) with an initial bilirubin value below 5.0 mg/dl (p less than 0.01). The pre-treatment bilirubin level correlated with the change in creatinine during aminoglycoside therapy (n = 42, r = 0.66, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: Aminoglycosides should probably be avoided in patients with biliary obstruction and a high serum bilirubin level.\r"

Our objective was to gather information regarding the integrity of bone mass in such long-term cancer survivors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Bone mineral density was measured using photon absorptiometry in five groups of women: 11 patients with Hodgkin's disease and ovarian failure (Group I); six patients with Hodgkin's disease and ovarian failure who received estrogen replacement (Group II); 15 patients with Hodgkin's disease and normal ovarian function (Group III); 16 premenopausal control subjects (Group IV); and 11 postmenopausal control subjects (Group V). All patients with Hodgkin's disease were in remission and had completed treatment more than five years earlier. RESULTS: Subjects in Group I were found to have significantly decreased radial (p = 0.0009), lumbar spine (p = 0.002), and femoral neck (p = 0.0001) bone mineral density measurements compared with those in subjects in Group IV; the bone mineral density measurements at all sites of subjects in Group I were no different than those of subjects in Group V. Subjects in Group III had bone density measurements that were similar to those in Group IV, although the radial bone mineral density value was significantly lower (p = 0.0004). Determination of serum gonadotropins and estradiol was consistent with the menstrual status defining the five groups. No secondary causes for decreased bone mineral density values could be detected, since the mean serum levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolites were similar among the groups, and all prolactin levels were normal. CONCLUSION: We have identified a new population of patients with a high risk of osteoporosis, and these results emphasize the importance of treatment-related ovarian failure in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 80 patients with liver biopsy proven primary hepatic amyloidosis was followed from diagnosis to death. RESULTS: At presentation, 77 percent of the group had an associated nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure, peripheral neuropathy, or orthostatic hypotension. Certain clues suggested the diagnosis of hepatic amyloidosis in patients with liver disease, including the following: (1) proteinuria (88 percent); (2) abnormal serum protein electrophoresis (monoclonal protein or hypogammaglobulinemia, 64 percent); (3) hyposplenism on the peripheral blood smear (62 percent), defined by the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies; and (4) hepatomegaly disproportional to the liver enzyme abnormalities. Liver function tests were not sensitive or specific. Hepatomegaly from amyloid was frequently seen, with normal levels of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin (32 percent). Myeloma was diagnosed in 11 patients but had no effect on the clinical course. In vitro coagulation abnormalities were common, bleeding was infrequent, and liver biopsy carried a slightly increased risk. The median survival of the entire group was nine months, and projected five- and 10-year survival rates were 13 and 1 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because survival is poor and no clinical features permit prospective recognition of those patients in whom the disease is likely to have an indolent course, a trial of therapy is warranted in all patients.\r"

We therefore investigated a number of parameters of neutrophil function after the in vitro addition of various concentrations of ribavirin. At pharmacologic concentrations (1.25-7.5 micrograms/mL), percent killing of phagocytized bacteria was increased as measured by an acridine orange fluorochrome microassay, significantly higher at a concentration of 5 micrograms/mL (p less than .02). There was no concomitant adverse effect on adherence, random migration, chemotaxis, opsonization or phagocytosis. The present data indicate that ribavirin has no acute suppressive effect on granulocyte function and may even enhance bacterial killing capabilities for treated patients.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (A-II) has been shown to stimulate plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion in experimental animals, although offsetting effects from a rise in arterial pressure may obscure the effect. A rise in plasma norepinephrine (NE) may have several effects on plasma AVP because of changes in arterial pressure and central adrenergic stimulation. As little data exist concerning these neurohumoral interrelationships in humans, the current investigation was performed to examine the role of acute changes in plasma NE and A-II in the control of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The question is of potential importance because of diffuse disturbances in neurohumoral control in diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. We measured heart rate, arterial pressure, and plasma AVP during 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/min infusions of NE, and during .05 and .10 micrograms/kg/min infusions of A-II. NE increased mean blood pressure from 81 +/- 11 mm Hg to 87 +/- 16 mm Hg at 2.5 micrograms/min and to 93 +/- 16 mm Hg at 5.0 micrograms/min (p less than .001). Heart rate was unchanged during the 2.5 micrograms/min infusion but declined from 58 +/- 9 beats/min to 54 +/- 9 beats/min during the 5.0 micrograms/min infusion (p = NS). Plasma AVP, 3.0 +/- 0.9 pg/mL, did not change. During A-II infusions, mean arterial pressure increased from 81 +/- 13 mm Hg to 92 +/- 17 mm Hg and 112 +/- 21 mm Hg at the two rates (p less than .001); heart rate declined from 61 +/- 6.8 beats/min to 59 +/- 9.1 beats/min and 56 +/- 11.3 beats/min (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We developed a simple one-step method for visualizing sweating that requires only soluble starch previously treated with iodine. When the powder is sprayed on the skin, sweat droplets are visualized as discrete dark purple dots. Since visualized dots are easily wiped off without staining the skin, sweating patterns can be obtained consecutively on the same skin site. The method is far superior to the classical Minor's method and is useful for clinical diagnosis of disorders of sweating and for visualization of the total body sweating for physiological studies. Two simple devices for spraying powder also have been presented.\r"

From the oxygen tension and content of blood taken at cardiac catheterization, the shunt ratio was calculated to be 57.8%. Multiple bilateral pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas were confirmed by angiography, and the patient was diagnosed as having hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. A review of x-ray films taken over a 24-year period demonstrated that the fistulas in both lungs had been increasing gradually in size at different rates. A right lower lobectomy relieved the hypoxia, but the patient died unexpectedly on the twelfth postoperative day. There was no evidence of fistula rupture on chest film, but no autopsy was performed.\r"

  ".U": "88267342\r", 
  ".W": "A system is presented for linking information about psychosocial characteristics of job situations to national health surveys. Job information can be imputed to individuals on surveys that contain three-digit US Census occupation codes. Occupational mean scores on psychosocial job characteristics-control over task situation (decision latitude), psychological work load, physical exertion, and other measures-for the linkage system are derived from US national surveys of working conditions (Quality of Employment Surveys 1969, 1972, and 1977). This paper discusses a new method for reducing the biases in multivariate analyses that are likely to arise when utilizing linkage systems based on mean scores. Such biases are reduced by modifying the linkage system to adjust imputed individual scores for demographic factors such as age, education, race, marital status and, implicitly, sex (since men and women have separate linkage data bases). Statistics on the linkage system's efficiency and reliability are reported. All dimensions have high inter-survey reproducibility. Despite their psychosocial nature, decision latitude and physical exertion can be more efficiently imputed with the linkage system than earnings (a non-psychosocial job characteristic). The linkage system presented here is a useful tool for initial epidemiological studies of the consequences of psychosocial job characteristics and constitutes the methodological basis for the subsequent paper.\r"

A new estimation method is used which imputes to census occupation codes, job characteristic information from national surveys of job characteristics (US Department of Labor, Quality of Employment Surveys). Controlling for age, we find that employed males with jobs which are simultaneously low in decision latitude and high in psychological work load (a multiplicative product term isolating 20 per cent of the population) have a higher prevalence of myocardial infarction in both data bases. In a logistic regression analysis, using job measures adjusted for demographic factors and controlling for age, race, education, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, smoking (HANES only), and physical exertion, we find a low decision latitude/high psychological demand multiplicative product term associated with MI in both data bases. Additional multiple logistic regressions show that low decision latitude is associated with increased prevalence of MI in both the HES and the HANES. Psychological workload and physical exertion are significant only in the HANES.\r"

The fathers in the first three groups appeared at serious educational and financial disadvantage as compared with those where neither parent was a teenager. Within the teenage parent groups, White fathers had lower educational attainment than Black; one in four White fathers was married vs less than 5 per cent of Black.

Onset of decline was measured using data for White men aged 35-74 and classified as early (1968 or before) vs late (after 1968). Ten socioenvironmental characteristics derived from US Census Bureau data were strongly related to onset of decline. Areas with the poorest socioenvironmental conditions were two to 10 times more likely to experience late onset than those areas with the highest levels. We found that income-related characteristics could account for most of the difference in onset of decline of IHD between metropolitan and non-metropolitan places. We conclude that community socioenvironmental characteristics provide the context for changes in risk factors and medical care.\r"

A substantial minority of children from all socioeconomic levels are afflicted by multiple health problems. The impact of multiple conditions, as measured by days spent ill in bed, appears much greater for children from low income families. Use of physician services was found to be similar for children of all socioeconomic levels when no significant health problems were present, but low income children with health problems used fewer physician visits on an adjusted basis than their higher income counterparts.\r"

Receptive anal intercourse with the index AIDS case and number of different sexual partners with whom subjects were anally receptive were both risk factors. Controlling for the number of partners with whom subjects were anally receptive, we found that the odds ratio of receptive anal intercourse with the case was infinite (95% confidence intervals, 3.3-infinity) if sexual contact continued up to or beyond the time of diagnosis, while the odds ratio was 1.0 (95% CI 0.3-3.2) if contact ceased before the case's AIDS diagnosis. Risk was not associated with the duration or frequency of contact. Our data suggest that the potential for sexual transmission from an HIV-infected person may be greater close to or after the onset of disease.\r"

However, more than 20 per cent of the study participants were women, and many participants were not aware that they were at risk of infection. The heterogeneity of the study population, the lack of awareness among many subjects of risk factors and self-exclusion procedures, and the high level of distress among many subjects after notification, emphasize the need for intensive, well-designed education and support programs.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of equi-anesthetic concentrations of halothane (HAL, n = 11), enflurane (ENF, n = 11) and isoflurane (ISO, n = 10) on cardiac function were studied and compared with a control group (n = 12) in isolated paced rat hearts by means of an antegrade heart perfusion technique. Left atrial pressure (LAP) and mean aortic pressure (MAP) could be altered independently of each other, and aortic flow, coronary flow (CF), and po2 in venous coronary effluent were continuously recorded. Stroke volume (SV), myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and myocardial oxygen extraction were calculated: 1) MAP was altered from 60 to 120 mmHg at a constant LAP (7.5 mmHg), and 2) LAP was varied from 4 to 12.5 mmHg at a constant MAP (80 mmHg). Left ventricular function curves (LVFC) were constructed and the maximal SV (SVmax) was obtained. The LAP needed to perform 75% of the maximal SV (LAP0.75) was estimated to assess the effect of the anesthetics on diastolic function. HAL ENF and ISO decreased SVmax significantly compared to control. This decrease was more pronounced for HAL (41%) compared to both ENF (26%) and ISO (26%). Accordingly, SV, at various levels of MAP, at a constant LAP, was significantly lower for HAL than for both ENF and ISO, while there was no significant difference between the latter two. None of the anesthetics shifted the LVFC to the right, i.e., did not affect diastolic properties. HAL induced the most pronounced decrease in MVO2, while there was no significant difference between ENF and ISO in this respect. Coronary flow (CF), at controlled perfusion pressures, decreased significantly with HAL but not with ENF or ISO compared to control. CF was significantly higher with ISO compared to both ENF and HAL. HAL and ISO, but not ENF, decreased myocardial oxygen extraction significantly compared to control and, thus, increased the myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio.\r"

Measurements were made during a deep level of anesthesia before relaxant administration, immediately after the loss of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch and 45 s later. In 22 patients receiving succinylcholine, there was a significant reduction in mean mouth opening (from 16.9 +/- 2.8 to 12.6 +/- 4.3 to 13.0 +/- 4.3 mm; P less than 0.0005) and an increase in jaw stiffness (from 102.3 +/- 21.9 to 154.5 +/- 77.4 to 150.5 +/- 77.0 Nm/degree; P less than 0.02) immediately after disappearance of the evoked thenar muscle twitch, as well as 45 s later. In six patients receiving succinylcholine, measurements were continued at 1 min intervals; mouth opening reduction and jaw stiffness increase lasted up to 10 min and extended beyond the return of visible twitch. One patient had a reduction of mouth opening from 20 to less than 1 mm; his corresponding jaw stiffness changed from 83.4 to 3335.4 Nm/degree. This patient, considered by us to have masseter spasm, required several attempts at tracheal intubation due to an increased resistance to mouth opening, as did one other patient. Patients receiving vecuronium showed a significant (P less than 0.02) increase of mouth opening 45 s following loss of twitch (from 19.8 +/- 3.6 to 20.9 +/- 4.1 mm; jaw stiffness changed from 87.0 +/- 15.3 to 83.0 +/- 17.2 Nm/degree).

Sixteen dogs, eight in each group, were anesthetized with equally potent inspired concentrations of either halothane (2 MAC) or isoflurane (2 MAC), intubated, and ventilated. Thirty minutes later, the heart was rapidly excised. A left ventricular slab was prepared and maintained at 37 degrees C. A portion of each slab was placed in a compressibility gauge that detects rigor onset by an abrupt increase in resistance to tissue deformation. Subendocardial tissue pressure was continuously measured in a second slab using needle-tipped Millar pressure transducers. A third slab was used for intermittent tissue sampling and HPLC assay of high-energy nucleotide levels. There were no differences in pre-ischemic heart rate, mean arterial pressure, glucose, lactate, PO2, PCO2, pH, plasma epinephrine, or norepinephrine levels between the two groups. The onset of rigor as measured by the compressibility gauge was delayed in the halothane group (68 +/- 7.2 vs. 60 +/- 5.0 min; P less than .05). Tissue ATP and ADP levels declined throughout the period of ischemia, with a trend towards preservation in the halothane group. The data show that myocardial tolerance to total normothermic ischemia is improved in animals anesthetized with halothane compared to isoflurane, independent of the effects on hemodynamics or collateral coronary circulation.\r"

This was done by comparing the areas under the inflation pressure-volume and inflation pressure-time curves generated when the patient was contributing to the work of ventilation with those following sedation, when inspiratory muscle activity was absent (defined as absence of diaphragmatic EMG activity and of palpable accessory muscle contraction). Inspiratory muscle inactivity could be predicted by the observation of a smooth rise in inflation pressure that was highly reproducible from breath to breath. Relaxation was present without sedation during MV in the control mode with inspiratory flow rates above 65 1/min. In the assist mode (AMV), both Wp and integral of Pmus.dt were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than in the control (CMV) mode. Reducing trigger sensitivity during AMV further increased Wp and integral of Pmus.dt (P less than 0.05). During AMV and CMV Wp and integral of Pmus.dt decreased with increasing rate of inspiratory flow delivered by the ventilator. With AMV at low trigger sensitivity and low flow rates, Wp approached 65% of the total inspiratory work. The authors conclude that inspiratory muscle activity can be substantial during MV, particularly during AMV at low trigger sensitivity and flow. Monitoring of inflation pressure is a simple means of determining the degree of inspiratory muscle rest during MV.\r"

Patients were given either 30 micrograms (group I), 50 micrograms (group II), or 75 micrograms (group III) of epidural sufentanil in 20 ml N saline. Repeat doses were given on request for the 24-h study period. Linear analogue pain score (PS), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured at 15-min intervals after each dose. Respiratory depression was assessed by the presence of: 1) slow respiratory rate (SRR--less than 10 breaths per minute for greater than 5 min), 2) apnea (AP--cessation of tidal ventilation for greater than 15 s), and 3) increased PaCO2 in arterial blood gases (ABG) drawn at regular intervals. SRR and AP were measured using respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP). A further group of ten patients (group IV) underwent preoperative RIP monitoring during sleep and in the absence of any drug. Maximum analgesia was achieved within 15 min after a dose of sufentanil for all groups. Analgesia was not significantly prolonged by increasing the dose of sufentanil. SRR occurred in all four groups (group I: 2/9; group II: 2/6; group III: 7/7; group IV: 2/10 P less than 0.05 I, IV:II, I, IV:III, II:III).

The distal tip of single-orificed central venous catheters can be precisely located using intravenous electrocardiography (IVECG). However, the site of origin of the IVECG complex with multiorificed central venous catheters is not well known. In this study, the site of origin of the IVECG complex deriving from the wire within a multiorificed Arrow Antecubital Central Venous Catheterization Kit, the same Arrow catheter type without wire, and a multiorificed Cook Bunegin-Albin CVP Kit was determined in ten anesthetized dogs. The IVECG was found to originate from the distal portion of the Arrow wire whether the distal tip of the wire was within the distal segment of the Arrow multiorificed catheter, at the tip of the catheter, or protruding several cm from the tip of the catheter. When the Arrow multiorificed catheter (without wire) was used to determine the IVECG, the mean site of origin of the IVECG was 1.7 +/- 1.2 cm (mean +/- SD) proximal to the distal catheter tip. When the Cook multiorificed catheter (without wire) was used to determine the IVECG, the mean site of origin of the IVECG was 2.5 +/- 0.6 cm proximal to the distal catheter tip. Knowledge of the site of origin of the IVECG with the Arrow and Cook multiorificed catheters should permit the distal tips of these catheters to be placed in locations where efficient retrieval of venous air emboli is likely.\r"

This retrospective review of 579 posterior fossa craniectomies performed over a 4-yr period from 1981 through 1984 examines outcome following these procedures performed with the patients in either the sitting (n = 333) or horizontal (supine, prone, lateral, park bench) (n = 246) position. Multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. Venous air embolism occurred significantly more often in patients in the sitting position (45% versus 12%). However, no morbidity or mortality was attributed to venous air embolism. The incidence of hypotension with positioning was not different by position (19% in the sitting patients and 24% in the horizontal patients). Average blood replacement was significantly lower in the sitting patients (359 ml versus 507 ml), and the incidence of transfusion of greater than two units of blood was significantly higher in the horizontal patients (13% versus 3%). Postoperative cranial nerve function was significantly better in patients in the sitting group as compared to those in the horizontal group. The incidence of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications was not different between groups. These outcome data suggest that there are potential advantages and disadvantages of both the sitting and horizontal positions without supporting a significantly increased morbidity or mortality associated with either position.\r"

  ".U": "88267553\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis that the neuromuscular blocking potency of pancuronium and vecuronium depends on the two acetylcholine moieties present at positions 3 and 17 was tested in cats by examining the neuromuscular profile of several desacetoxy analogues. Blockade of sciatic nerve-induced contraction of the tibialis and soleus muscles, as well as the effects on vagal-induced bradycardia and on sympathetically induced contractions of the nictitating membrane, were studied. The bis-desacetoxy analogue of pancuronium (ORG 7931) was one-fifth as potent as the parent compound as a neuromuscular blocking drug and as a vagolytic agent, but the neuromuscular block was faster in onset and shorter in duration than that produced by pancuronium. The desacetoxy analogues of vecuronium (ORG 8730 and ORG 8764) also were less potent neuromuscular blocking drugs, and, in addition, produced more vagal block than did vecuronium itself. The neuromuscular block produced by these desacetoxy analogues was of more rapid onset and shorter duration than that produced by vecuronium. The results thus showed that the greater neuromuscular blocking potency of pancuronium and vecuronium is lost after removal of one or both of the acetylcholine moieties. An analysis of the relationship between neuromuscular blocking dose and duration of action revealed that it was reciprocal, and it is suggested that a nondepolarizing equivalent of suxamethonium, when discovered, may necessarily be a drug of relatively low potency.\r"

  ".U": "88267555\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of 1) isoflurane (ISO)- and halothane (HAL)-induced hypotension to a mean aortic pressure (AoP) of 55 mmHg, and 2) of substituting ISO and HAL for each other at a mean AoP of 55 mmHg on global and regional left ventricular performance (ultrasonic dimension technique) and on coronary hemodynamics (electromagnetic flow probes) were studied in eight open-chest dogs (anesthetized and paralyzed by continuous infusions of fentanyl and pancuronium) with a critical coronary artery stenosis (micrometer-controlled snare) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The stenosis reduced resting coronary blood flow by 5% (P less than 0.05) without affecting global or regional myocardial performance. HAL- and ISO-induced hypotension caused comparable decreases in global cardiac function, but regional myocardial dysfunction in the area of stenosis and the reduction in coronary flow through the stenosed LAD were more pronounced during ISO. Substitution of HAL for ISO at constant mean AoP, heart rate, end-diastolic dimensions and pressures, and stroke volume resulted in significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) amelioration of regional myocardial dysfunction (improvement in contraction amplitude, disappearance of paradoxical systolic lengthening and akinesis), a 20% increase in flow through the stenosed LAD, and a 20% decrease in flow through the unobstructed left circumflex coronary artery. These data suggest that, in the presence of a critical coronary artery stenosis: 1) ISO- and HAL-associated hypotension result in comparable decreases in global cardiac function, 2) ISO-associated hypotension is more likely to cause severe regional myocardial dysfunction suggestive of ischemia than equal degrees of HAL-associated hypotension, and 3) the different effects of HAL and ISO on ischemic myocardial segments at equally reduced coronary perfusion pressure are primarily related to their different effects on coronary vasomotor tone.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether they could establish reliable, objective criteria that would predict safe, primary closure of abdominal wall defects (omphalocele/gastroschisis) in newborn infants, the authors measured intraoperative changes in intra-gastric pressure (IGP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), systolic arterial blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Eleven neonates, who averaged 2.7 kg (range 1.5-4.1 kg) and 36 weeks gestation (range 30-41 weeks) were anesthetized with fentanyl (7.5-12.5 micrograms/kg), metocurine (0.3 mg/kg), and oxygen. Three infants had defects that were too large to close primarily. Of the eight infants who underwent primary closure, four required re-operation within 24 h because of oliguria or poor peripheral perfusion. Infants who required re-operation had intra-gastric pressures of 20 mmHg or more, a decrease in CI of 0.78 1.min.m2 or more, and an increase in CVP of 4 mmHg or more. Heart rate, BP, and systemic vascular resistance did not differ in infants requiring and not requiring re-operation. The authors conclude that intraoperative measurement of changes in IGP, CVP, and/or CI can reliably predict success or failure of primary operative repair of abdominal wall defects in human neonates.\r"

In addition, there is no evidence that vecuronium stimulates the release of histamine. The authors performed in vitro kinetic studies to determine the effect of vecuronium on histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), the primary catabolic enzyme for histamine in humans. They also examined plasma from patients who had received vecuronium (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg) to determine whether clinically used concentrations of the drug could inhibit HNMT. It was determined that vecuronium is a strong inhibitor of HNMT; apparent Ki = 1 microM. The inhibition is competitive with respect to methyl-donor and noncompetitive with respect to histamine. Vecuronium, in doses greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg, may delay the metabolism of histamine by HNMT in vitro.\r"

Six hundred and forty-one sera from healthy donors were tested as controls. Our data emphasize the importance of IgE antibodies to ocular larva migrans syndrome and suggest that they play a significant role as a marker of infection. In the visceral form, IgG antibodies seem to mask the presence of IgE by a competitive mechanism toward the same epitopes of the parasite. In fact, IgE antibody titers increase after depletion of IgG from serum.\r"

None of the patients however had an exacerbation of their irritable bowel symptoms with a food challenge.

Comparison between nasal expiratory and inspiratory peak flow was performed before and after provocation of 12 grass pollen-allergic patients. Inspiratory peak flow showed certain advantages compared with expiratory peak flow measurements. The results can best be expressed as the means rather than the top values of three consecutive registrations. Twelve healthy subjects were also tested with rhinomanometry, nasal expiratory and inspiratory peak flow before and after decongestion with nose spray.

In one case, the patient presented a severe life-threatening reaction when stung by a honey bee. Three others had the development of new clinical sensitivity suggesting a re-sensitization. This occurred in the fifth patient after a severe viral infection. By means of a rush protocol and monthly doses of 200 to 400 micrograms of honey bee venom, the patients were subsequently protected efficiently. In most cases these reactions might have been predicted since patients experienced large local reactions prior to the systemic reactions when allergens were injected. Further, in four cases there was an increased skin test reactivity or raised serum honey bee venom IgE levels or both. In all patients, the levels of serum honey bee venom IgG was under 200 U/mL (IgG Pharmacia RAST).\r"

A rich experience in secondary component procedures was maintained in thoracic, pediatric and plastic surgery, all of which are services within the department of surgery. A relatively low but stable experience in gynecology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics and urology has been reported, which did not change when these disciplines became separate departments. Finally, there has been a dramatic increase in endoscopic procedures performed in the surgery department despite the presence of endoscopic services in other departments. It is believed that such an institutional review of surgical resident caseload over time will be of help not only to program directors but also to accrediting and certifying organizations concerned with surgical training programs and their graduates.\r"

Five patients also received external beam radiation and four received chemotherapy. Early complications were minimal. Late complications included cholangitis, gastroduodenal ulceration, gastric outlet obstruction and portal vein thrombosis. Symptomatic recurrent or residual disease developed in eight patients with a median disease-free survival of 6 months. Seven patients failed locally; four recurred outside of the intraoperatively radiated field. The longest survivor is free of disease at 40 months; one patient is alive with disease at 30 months. Mean and median survivals were 16.8 months and 13 months respectively with 56 per cent 1-year survival. This was not different from a mean survival of 11 months and 46 per cent 1-year survival observed in 13 concurrent patients treated by external beam +/- 192Ir. Survival of six patients not treated by radiation was only 4.6 months (P = 0.3). Two thirds of patients had good or fair palliation. IORT has theoretical advantages for the treatment of locally advanced biliary cancer; preliminary results suggest useful palliation and potential long-term survival. Complications require ongoing evaluation and superiority to conventional treatment modalities has not been demonstrated.\r"

On days 1, 7, and 14, serum immunoglobulins of the IgA, IgG, and IgM classes were measured in 46 consecutive patients who sustained severe trauma with an injury severity score of at least 20. The patients were divided into four groups: 1) an uneventful recovery group (n = 11) of nonthermal trauma patients who did not become infected; 2) an infected nonthermal group without splenectomy; 3) an infected group of burn patients; and 4) 12 patients who underwent splenectomy of which nine became infected following nonthermal trauma. In each patient group, IgA, IgG, and IgM were all reduced, and group 1 had a steady return to normal range. Group 2 patients exhibited supranormal responses in all 3 classes at one week and supranormal IgA and IgG responses at two weeks. In contrast, both infected burn and splenectomized patients had markedly reduced IgG and IgM levels compared with the group 2 patients (P less than 0.05). Splenectomy sharply reduced IgM response to infection at 7 and 14 days compared with nonsplenectomized infected posttraumatic patients. Immunoglobulin response after trauma depended on the type of injury, presence of infection, splenic function, and type of immunoglobulin. Recognition of immunoglobulin deficiencies in both the burn and splenectomized patient may permit focused therapy, such as specific replacement of these proteins.\r"

One hundred twenty four had choledocholithiasis, and six had papillary stenosis after cholecystectomy. Urgent E.R.S. was performed for septic cholangitis in 12 patients and biliary pancreatitis in four. There were six patients with choledocholithiasis in whom sphincterotomy was not possible. Of the 118 patients with successful papillotomy for choledocholithiasis, spontaneous passage of calculi after E.R.S. occurred in 28 cases (24%), and instrumental extraction of stones was possible in 81 (69%). Duct clearance failed in nine patients (8%), mostly due to the large size of the retained stones. The largest stone extracted was 26 mm in diameter. The overall success rate of removing common bile duct stones was 109 in 118 cases (88%). In patients with papillary stenosis, E.R.S. was successful in relieving symptoms and biochemical cholestasis in six of six cases (100%). Complications occurred in only two patients. The complications were pancreatitis in one and hemorrhage in one. None of these patients required surgical treatment of the complication. Endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy is effective for the removal of stones of the common bile duct, and at relieving the symptoms of papillary stenosis. It is safe in experienced hands and has led to only rare complications.\r"

The major concerns derived from the study are the short-term survival in a small number of patients and aspiration in selective patients. Attempts should be made to identify these patients and avoid PEG since its benefits will be limited. When used selectively, PEG can improve the quality of life of the cancer patient.\r"

The mortality rate (MR) overall was 57 per cent, and for specific portions of the IVC it was: retrohepatic - 60 per cent (9/15); suprarenal 59 per cent (16/27); pararenal - 45 per cent (5/11); and infrarenal - 57 per cent (8/14). Several prognostic factors were identified. Of 44 patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a BP less than 70 mm Hg, 33 (75%) died. Of 28 patients who experienced greater than 30 minutes of shock, 15 (83%) died. Of 26 patients presenting to the OR with a systolic blood pressure less than 70 mm Hg, 22 (85%) died. Of 40 patients who received greater than 10 units of blood in the ED and OR, 31 (78%) died. Of 19 patients who had a prelaparotomy thoracotomy with cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta for persistent severe shock (BP less than 70), nine responded rapidly with a sustained increase in systolic BP to greater than 90 mm Hg with four (44%) survivors. All ten patients who did not respond to prelaparotomy aortic cross-clamping died in the OR. Of seven patients with persistent shock (BP less than 70) without a prelaparotomy thoracotomy, there were no survivors. Six patients with retrohepatic IVC injuries underwent atrio-caval shunting with no survivors; of nine others with similar injuries treated without a shunt, six (67%) survived. Of 18 patients who received more than ten units of blood and survived the surgery, ten (56%) developed septic complications, and four of these patients died. Of 17 patients who received less than ten units of blood and survived the surgery, none became septic. Thus, early control of shock and bleeding is essential, not only to reduce mortality rate, but also later septic complications.\r"

Of these 194 accidents, 29 per cent involved four-wheelers. In this 78 per cent male population (mean age 21), 23 per cent required hospitalization. One half of these victims sustained a fracture or dislocation and 14 per cent needed surgery. Thirteen per cent had serious neurologic injury. Average hospital bills were $294 for outpatients and $7669 for inpatients. Two thirds of the patients had some disability. Three fatalities were recorded. Analysis of the data showed the following: (1) the three-wheeled ATV design is significantly more unstable than that of the four-wheeler (P less than .001); (2) though more stable, the four-wheeled ATV was still associated with frequent accidents as severe as those involving three-wheelers; (3) riders under age 16 were more likely to be using their ATV improperly (P greater than .05) and had more severe injuries with a higher hospitalization rate, and (4) these ATV riders had inadequate training and protective gear. Lastly, recommendations are made that ATVs need their design flaws corrected for safer use, and that mandatory minimum age requirements, rider education, and helmet use should reduce injuries.\r"

Twenty five patients with pneumomediastinum treated on a surgical service over a 6 year period were reviewed. The cause of the mediastinal emphysema was related to trauma in seven patients, attempted central venous access in four patients, cardiopulmonary resuscitation in four patients and some type of Valsalva maneuver in ten patients. Besides the mediastinal emphysema, air may dissect into the peritoneal cavity, the pericardium, and the subcutaneous tissues within the neck and chest wall. Treatment of the mediastinal emphysema, per se, is expectant; success or failure is determined by treatment of the associated underlying problems. Deaths occurred in three patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in one patient after crushing chest injury. One patient with an associated hydrothorax was found to have a perforated distal esophagus which was treated by emergency fundoplication. When associated diseases are absent and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or hydrothorax, no special diagnostic tests are indicated. Sequential chest x-rays are used to follow the pneumomediastinum through resolution, which usually occurs within 72 hours.\r"

Multiple biopsies were required in 19 patients because of multiple lesions, reaccumulation of cysts, follow-up of nodules failing to regress, or inadequate material. Adequate material was obtained in 97 per cent of FNB and 92 per cent of CNB. FNB and CNB agreed in 20 of 28 cases. There were no complications with FNB and one patient (4%) hemorrhaged with CNB. Forty nine patients underwent thyroidectomy. Postoperative diagnoses include papillary carcinoma (9), follicular carcinoma (2), lymphoma (2), medullary carcinoma (1), metastatic carcinoma (1), benign nodular goiter (14), follicular neoplasm (15), and thyroiditis (5). Sixty per cent of patients avoided surgery, 61 per cent of operated specimens contained neoplasia and 31 per cent contained malignancy. Eighty seven per cent of malignancies were identified at the initial evaluation. FNB had 86 per cent sensitivity for neoplasia and 44 per cent specificity for neoplasm (94% for papillary carcinoma). CNB had 89 per cent sensitivity and 67 per cent specificity for neoplasm. FNB and CNB are useful means of assessing thyroid nodules for the presence of cancer. They can decrease the need for diagnostic thyroidectomy. However, clinical evaluation must still be used in conjunction when determining the need for thyroidectomy.\r"

It was 46 per cent in those patients presenting with a solitary nodule. Among the 24 patients with a malignancy, the carcinoma was of the papillary variety in 63 per cent, follicular in 25 per cent and medullary in 12 per cent. Two thirds of the patients had metastatic disease at the time of presentation. All patients with thyroid carcinoma were treated with total thyroidectomy. Other measures included neck dissection and radioactive iodine. When the eight patients with a history of head and neck irradiation and the three patients with medullary carcinoma were excluded, the incidence of carcinoma was 28 per cent. In summary, in spite of the decline in radiation associated cases, the incidence of carcinoma in nodular thyroid disease in the population under 21 years, remains at the relatively high figure of 28 per cent.\r"

The autonomy of these nodules was substantiated by cytomel nonsuppressibility on 131I or 123I scanning, or TSH stimulated enhancement of the remaining suppressed thyroid tissue (n = 24); or as a solitary toxic hot nodule with suppression of the remaining thyroid tissue (n = 6). Seventeen of these patients were euthyroid and 13 were thyrotoxic and required preoperative preparation with antithyroid medication. Five patients had a history of head and neck irradiation. The population consisted of 24 women and six men. Their ages ranged from 14 to 68 years. The tumors ranged in size from 1.5 to 7 cm. The pathologic findings consisted of \"colloid\" adenoma in nine patients, follicular adenoma in 19 patients, and a follicular carcinoma in two patients, for an incidence of 6 per cent. It is of interest that neither of the patients with thyroid carcinoma were toxic or had a history of radiation exposure. These findings support the concept that the incidence of carcinoma in truly autonomous \"HOT\" thyroid nodules is not negligible.\r"

A retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the utility of diagnostic peritoneal lavage to diagnose intra-abdominal surgical disease. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was carried out in patients in whom the physical exam was deemed unreliable, such as in patients with cardiopulmonary instability or mental obtundation. Patients were included in the study if autopsy or laparotomy confirmation of the lavage data was available. Forty four patients met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of this study. Of the twenty three patients with a positive lavage, three false-positive diagnostic peritoneal lavages were discovered, either at laparotomy or postmortem exam. Of the twenty one patients where diagnostic peritoneal lavage was negative, no false-negatives were discovered at autopsy or laparatomy. Therefore, this test is 100 per cent sensitive and 88 per cent specific. It is concluded that a negative diagnostic peritoneal lavage makes intra-abdominal surgical disease highly unlikely. However, a positive lavage may require further diagnostic work-up.\r"

Previous studies in young animals showed that the liver's gluconeogenic capacity was an important determinant of survival in shock states. This study compared hepatic carbohydrate intermediates from young rats and old rats to correlate changes during peritonitis septic shock with known differences in survival times. Old control rats had glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) concentrations two-fold higher than young controls, 354 +/- 49 nanomole/g wet liver vs 180 +/- 41, suggesting a reduced ability to convert hexose monophosphate precursor into blood sugar. There was a 53% increase in G6P levels in the peritonitis livers, to 540 +/- 155 nanomole/g liver while in young septic rats the G6P decreased 33 per cent. These opposite, highly significant changes in shock (P = 0.01) show the reduced ability of old animals to mobilize gluconeogenic precursors. Fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) in old control liver was 14 +/- 3 nanomole/g liver and did not change in shock; in young rats, FBP was 7.0 +/- 3 nanomole and increased 230 per cent in shock, showing a different metabolic response in young and old animals. These data suggest older animals may be more vulnerable to shock because of lower gluconeogenic potential.\r"

Foley catheterization was an associated factor in 129 patients (84%). UTI was caused by 40 different species of bacteria. In 28 infections (13%), the UTI was polymicrobial. Only nine patients had bacteremia. The bacteriology of the UTI depended on whether the patient had received systemic antibiotics previously during the hospitalization. Prior antibiotic administration increased the probability of Pseudomonas and Serratia as pathogens. Thus, patients that have had antibiotic therapy demonstrate a distribution of pathogens that are different from patients not receiving antibiotics, and a distribution different from the community-acquired UTI. Continued emphasis on the shorter duration and more judicious use of systemic antibiotics for both prophylaxis and therapy is warranted.\r"

Each transmission occurred in a different setting. A 23-year-old white woman had immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura in July 1985, with a platelet count of 11 X 10(9)/L. In January 1987, she had prominent submandibular and posterior cervical adenopathy. A careful social-sexual history revealed several sexual contacts with a male narcotic addict before July 1985. A 27-year-old heterosexual white man had a platelet count of 8 X 10(9)/L in December 1986. A social-sexual history revealed that his fiancee had been an intravenous narcotic addict 6 years ago. A 64-year-old white woman had a platelet count of 75 X 10(9)/L in May 1986, approximately 2 years after she had resumed having sexual intercourse with her husband who had had a triple coronary bypass in October 1983. The husband had received HIV-seropositive blood. A 42-year-old white man had a platelet count of 45 X 10(9)/L, which was associated with a cutaneous eruption refractory to antibiotics and antifungal agents. He had had sexual contacts with several women, who, to the best of his knowledge, were neither prostitutes nor intravenous narcotic addicts. He denied homosexuality or drug abuse. All four patients were HIV-seropositive and had circulating immune complexes and platelet-associated IgG, C3C4, and IgM values that were considerably higher than those usually measured in patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia, averaging 2.4-, 2.2-, 6.5- and 5.2-fold higher, respectively. Thus, HIV-related immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura can be heterosexually spread and should become part of the differential diagnosis of unexplained thrombocytopenia. Obtaining a careful social-sexual history is mandatory in such patients.\r"

The diagnosis in all four cases had been made after 1985. The association of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with HIV infection was judged to be statistically significant on the basis of the proportion of patients with AIDS among the general population of patients admitted to the same institution during the same period. The fact that this association is only now being recognized suggests that there may be a long incubation period for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or that the association is a rare one recognized now only because of the increased number of persons with AIDS.\r"

SETTING: Fort Benning, Georgia. PARTICIPANTS: 1230 soldiers met the criteria for inclusion and completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: According to the definition of smoking status in the initial questionnaire, smokers had a relative risk for upper respiratory infection of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.8). This effect was not substantially altered by different definitions of smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: Young military recruits who smoked during basic combat training had more upper respiratory infections than nonsmokers.

Because early childhood psychomotor development is usually normal, the condition appears benign and may not even be recognized. The episodes of laughter are brief, frequent, and mechanical in nature. These features distinguish it from other forms of epileptic laughter, particularly that which occurs in temporal lobe epilepsy. Subsequently, the seizures become longer, other seizure types appear, and between the ages of 4 and 10 years, the clinical and electroencephalographic features of secondary generalized epilepsy develop. Cognitive deterioration occurs and severe behavior problems are frequent. Prognosis for seizure control and social adjustment is poor. Cortical abnormality occurs in association with the hypothalamic hamartoma. The lesions are best detected by magnetic resonance imaging but may be difficult to identify by computed tomographic scanning.\r"

The neuropathy occurred in the context of a multisystem disorder (Group 1) or in apparent isolation (Group 2). The average age of patients was 59 in Group 1 and 61 in Group 2. Females were more commonly affected than males, especially in the first group. Necrotizing arteritis complicated the course of rheumatoid arthritis in 25 patients. In 3 patients necrotizing arteritis was associated with infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, the agent of AIDS. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen were positive in 19 patients. Mononeuritis was present in 13, mononeuritis multiplex in 62, and distal symmetrical sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy in 19 patients. In both groups of patients, the muscle biopsy was more frequently diagnostic for arteritis than was the nerve biopsy (80% versus 55%). The average incidence of isolated fibers undergoing axonal degeneration was 64.8%; that of demyelinated/remyelinated fibers was 1.9%. We conclude that the combination of nerve and muscle sampling increases the chance of visualizing characteristic arterial lesions in vasculitic neuropathy.\r"

Four patients had marked reduction of homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and all showed low CSF 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenylethylene glycol, indicating reduced dopamine and norepinephrine turnover. Three patients showed high CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggesting increased serotonin turnover. Some patients improved with carbidopa-levodopa, but others benefited from tetrabenazine, a monoamine-depleting agent. This study provides support for the theory of abnormal central monoamine metabolism in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\r"

The myelinated fiber density was reduced in 11 of the 13 myotonic dystrophy patients, with preferential loss of large myelinated fibers. Unmyelinated fiber densities and diameters were normal. Teased fiber studies commonly revealed focal areas of remyelination and abnormal wrinkling of the myelin sheath. Measurement of internodal length disclosed features of both axonal regeneration and focal demyelination-remyelination. These findings are consistent with a chronic axonopathy of moderate severity, possibly due to axonal atrophy.\r"

The drugs studied included 5-HT antagonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. At 5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino)-tetralin, (-)pindolol, alprenolol, (-)propranolol, methysergide, cyproheptadine, and pizotifen are similar in that they display affinities of approximately 100 nM for this receptor. By contrast, only methysergide displays relatively high affinity (120 +/- 60 nM), whereas all other drugs have affinities greater than 1,000 nM for non-5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-5-HT in human cortex. Finally, at 5-HT2 receptors labeled by 3H-spiperone, cyproheptadine, methysergide, and pizotifen are extremely potent agents (affinity constants of 1 to 10 nM), whereas amitriptyline (23 +/- 4 nM), verapamil (140 +/- 50 nM), and nifedipine (320 +/- 80 nM) are moderately potent. All other drugs are inactive at concentrations below 1,000 nM. These data demonstrate that most antimigraine drugs display high affinity for the 5-HT1A and/or 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in human brain. However, antimigraine efficacy cannot be explained by drug interactions with a single 5-HT receptor subtype.\r"

To achieve a better definition of the relationships between brain injury, handedness, and speech lateralization, we reviewed the records of 237 consecutive patients who underwent amobarbital testing. Brain injuries sufficient to cause right hemiparesis were strongly associated with left handedness and atypical (right hemisphere or bilateral) speech representation. Among nonhemiparetic patients, abnormal extratemporal radiological findings were associated with an increased incidence of left handedness and atypical speech lateralization. It was not possible to demonstrate any alteration in handedness or speech representation resulting from abnormalities restricted to the temporal lobes, although such alterations could not be excluded. Handedness and speech lateralization established using amobarbital studies in neurosurgical patients may not be representative of the normal population.\r"

Analysis of the relationship between these tumors revealed that the factors which predicted the likelihood of developing a solar keratosis were essentially the same as those that predicted the likelihood of developing a BCC and/or an SCC. These were age, sex, years of residence in Australia, indoor or outdoor occupation, tanning ability, propensity to sunburn, and location of residence. The presence of a coexisting solar keratosis was necessary for the development of an SCC in contrast to the development of a BCC. The findings suggest that unlike BCCs, the majority of SCCs in light-exposed areas may arise from preexisting solar keratoses. Whereas the prevalence of BCCs and SCCs was relatively constant in the three locations, the prevalence of solar keratoses differed markedly in direct relation to the degree of isolation. This suggests that solar keratoses are a more sensitive indicator of sunlight exposure than invasive carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Among 82 inpatients with psoriasis, 67% (55 patients) reported moderate or severe pruritus. The degree of depressive psychopathology discriminated between the mild, moderate, and severe pruritus groups at admission. Prospectively, the change in depression scores correlated with the change in pruritus pretreatment to posttreatment. Pruritus severity did not correlate significantly with stress due to life events, age at onset, ethyl duration of psoriasis, age, sex, marital status, and average reported daily alcohol (ethanol) consumption. Among the objective dermatologic measures, including extent and severity of lesions, only the degree of perilesional irritation discriminated between the mild, moderate, and severe pruritus groups at admission, and prospectively, change in this measure correlated with the change in pruritus pretreatment to posttreatment. This finding was most likely related to the self-excoriation associated with pruritus. Intrapsychic factors (eg, the severity of depression) rather than external psychosocial or well-defined dermatologic factors, were the most significant correlates of pruritus in psoriasis.\r"

To study the relationship of the two diseases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed on 28 patients with SS and 49 patients with BD. Of the 28 patients with SS, seven had BD symptoms. The frequencies of both HLA-B51 and -DQw3 were significantly higher in patients with BD. However, the frequencies of the two HLA antigens in the 28 patients with SS and the 21 patients with SS without BD symptoms were not significantly different from the controls. The frequency of HLA-Bw54 was significantly increased in both groups of patients with SS. Taken together, these data indicate that SS is a genetically distinct disease entity from BD, although their symptoms are similar and the incidence of SS among patients with BD is high in Japan.\r"

The cumulative prevalence of bronchial hyperreactivity was 9.7% and of allergic asthma 5.2%. Children living near a paper pulp plant more often had symptoms suggesting bronchial hyperreactivity (124 (13.0%), relative risk 1.3) and allergic asthma (68 (7.1%), relative risk 1.3). In children living in a damp house problem bronchial hyperreactivity was found in 76 (19.0%) (relative risk 1.9) and allergic asthma in 35 (8.7%) of the children (relative risk 1.9). Children living in a damp house with parents who smoked had the highest figures: bronchial hyperreactivity was found in 44 (23.5%) (relative risk 2.8) and allergic asthma in 22 (11.6%) (relative risk 2.5). The results indicate that various moderate environmental pollutants may act synergistically to increase bronchial hyperreactivity and allergy especially in children with a family history of allergy.\r"

All 10 showed a significant deterioration in lung function when given nebulised water for two minutes with an increase in airways resistance and a decrease in specific conductance at one and five minutes after nebulisation compared with baseline readings. Measurements returned to baseline values within 15 minutes. When the same amount of nebulised water was given 20 minutes after nebulised salbutamol, however, there was no significant deterioration in lung function at one and five minutes after administration of nebulised water. We conclude that the airways were protected against the bronchoconstricting effect of nebulised water by the beta 2 adrenoreceptor stimulant salbutamol.\r"

Mean growth velocity increased from 4.5 cm/year in the oxandrolone treated group to 9.6 cm/year in three months, and this was sustained at 8.6 cm/year after cessation of treatment. In the placebo treated group, growth rate showed no alteration from 5.1 cm/year to 5.2 cm/year; boys in this group were then treated with oxandrolone, 2.5 mg a day (mean dose 0.073 mg/kg/day) for three months and growth velocity accelerated to 8.6 cm/year. Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor -1/somatomedin-C (IGF-1) increased during oxandrolone treatment and continued to rise after treatment had ceased. There was no change in serum IGF-1 concentration during treatment with placebo. Oxandrolone, when used in an appropriate regimen, is an effective, safe treatment for boys with constitutional delay of growth and puberty.\r"

Seventeen of the 20 children recovered completely within three months of starting treatment.

There was no significant difference in weight and forced expiratory volume in one second between the end of home treatment and the end of hospital treatment while forced vital capacity was better after home treatment.

Because of the statement by the British Paediatric Association/Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation Liaison group that immunisations should normally begin three months after the date of birth, the records of all infants born in 1984 and currently (June 1986) resident in the London Borough of Newham were studied to find out if this recommendation was being implemented. Subjects were divided into groups by birth weight and where possible by gestational age. Cumulative uptakes by age of any component of the first and third triple immunisations, and of the pertussis component, were plotted separately. Comparison of uptake of the first course showed a considerable initial delay for infants weighing less than 2000 g at birth compared with heavier babies, but by 18 months the coverage was almost identical. This difference was not evident for the third course. A similar delay was apparent when infants of 37 weeks' gestation or less were compared with babies born at full term, though recording of gestational age was incomplete. Final overall uptake was poor for all groups. Differences among groups in numbers consenting were not an important factor. Informing those responsible for giving the immunisations of these findings has stimulated their interest in improving practice by implementing the recommendations.\r"

One hundred and forty four infants were eligible for inclusion in the study. Altogether 140 infants of less than 1500 g birth weight were examined, 42 (30%) of whom developed retinopathy of prematurity. Fifteen of these infants had progression to advanced disease (stage III or stage IV). One hundred and seventeen of the infants were of less than 31 weeks' gestation and 34 (29%) of them developed retinopathy of prematurity. Thirty four risk factors shown previously to be associated with the development of the disease were collected prospectively and analysed using multiple logistic regression analysis to determine the independently significant variables. Three risk factors: acidosis, the number of times that the pH was less than 7.2; hyperoxia, the number of times that arterial oxygen tension was greater than 12 kPa; and gestational age were found to be independently associated with the development of retinopathy of prematurity in these infants. These findings suggest that acidosis may be an important aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

Similar bands were detected after gel electrophoresis of purified adult plasma fibronectin and whole plasma from breast fed and formula fed neonates after staining or immunoblotting. Fibronectin isolated from breast milk also appeared similar to purified plasma fibronectin. It is possible, although unlikely, that fibronectin is absorbed intact from ingested colostrum.

In all patients clinically apparent apnoeic episodes were associated with the rapid onset and progression of central cyanosis. When overnight recordings were compared, patients with pertussis had a greater frequency of apnoeic pauses (particularly those greater than or equal to 12.0 seconds duration) and a greater frequency of episodes of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 0.5 seconds) associated with apnoeic pauses. In addition to episodes of hypoxaemia associated with a prolonged absence of breathing movements, patients with pertussis had frequent dips in oxygen saturation in association with continued breathing movements with and without continued inspiratory airflow. These episodes of hypoxaemia during continued breathing movements were more common in patients with pertussis. These findings suggest that episodes of abnormal apnoea accompanied by evidence of a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion of the lungs may produce the rapid onset of severe hypoxaemia in infants with pertussis.\r"

A longitudinal study was undertaken on 25 healthy newborn babies during the first 20 days of life, and a cross sectional study was performed on 112 healthy children between 1 day and 18 years of age. A rapid linear increase of flow velocities was found within the first 20 days with higher velocities in neonates of higher birth weight and gestational age. Maximal values were recorded at the age of 5 to 6 years. After that the velocities decreased linearly to 70% of their maximum at the age of 18 years. Reference values were derived from the data considering age and birth weight. The increasing flow velocities probably reflect the increasing cerebral blood flow during the first years of life. Our results also support the hypothesis of a decrease in cerebrovascular resistance during infancy. With the technique of transcranial Doppler sonography and the introduced reference values normal and abnormal intracranial flow velocities can now be assessed by non-invasive methods in all paediatric age groups.\r"

There was a strong correlation between the magnitude of the circadian fall and a single morning measurement of the plasma testosterone concentration taken near the time of the 170H-progesterone rhythm samples. Poor control in pubertal girls produced an exaggerated circadian fall in 170H-progesterone concentrations that were raised at all sampling times. Optimal control (plasma testosterone 1.5-2.5 nmol/l) was associated with blood spot and salivary 170H-progesterone concentrations at 0800 hours of between 30-70 nmol/l and 260-1000 pmol/l, respectively, falling thereafter to less than 10 nmol/l and less than 150 pmol/l, respectively. Similar results were obtained in prepubertal patients. Nomograms have been constructed to interpret the daily profiles of blood spot or salivary measurements of 170H-progesterone, or both. The analysis of 170H-progesterone circadian rhythms is useful in monitoring treatment in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, particularly those who may be overtreated.\r"

Single samples of blood for measurement of plasma testosterone, 170H-progesterone, and androstenedione concentrations were collected from these and a further seven patients for comparison. Plasma androstenedione concentrations showed a close correlation with plasma concentrations of 170H-progesterone and testosterone. There was a strong correlation between the salivary androstenedione profiles and plasma testosterone concentrations in pubertal girls. Concentrations of androstenedione in saliva decreased during the day but remained raised at each sampling time in relation to plasma testosterone concentrations. Salivary androstenedione profiles are shown as nomograms to distinguish the degree of therapeutic control. The concentration of androstenedione, measured in plasma or saliva, is an alternative marker to monitor control of treatment in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The measurement in saliva is a useful index of androgen production when blood sampling is difficult.\r"

Gallstone formation was studied in 20 prairie dogs fed a 0.4% cholesterol-supplemented liquid diet. In ten animals, ethanol provided 35% of total calories. In ten pair-fed controls, ethanol was replaced with isocaloric maltose. After 3 months the gallbladders were inspected for gallstones, and gallbladder bile was analyzed. Cholesterol macroaggregates were present in all controls and pigment concretions were noted in five. No stones were observed in ethanol-fed animals. Bile in the ethanol group contained less cholesterol than the controls (5.60 +/- 0.71 vs. 9.16 +/- 0.61 mmol/L, p less than 0.05) while phospholipids, total bile acids, and bilirubin were unchanged. The resulting cholesterol saturation index was reduced in the ethanol group (0.81 vs. 1.22, p less than 0.05). The ratios of trihydroxy to dihydroxy bile acids were also different (2.07 +/- 0.25 in ETOH vs. 3.29 in controls, p less than 0.05). The bile calcium concentration was higher in control animals presumably secondary to the use of complex sugars (5.36 +/- 0.37 vs. 3.77 +/- 0.32 mmol/L, p less than 0.05). These results confirm that ethanol inhibits cholesterol gallstone formation. They further suggest that this effect is dependent on reductions of biliary cholesterol and selective changes in bile acid concentrations.\r"

The primary was located in the head of the pancreas in 32 and the body in three. No patient in this group had a curative resection. All patients were treated by a combination of biliary and gastric bypass prior to or concurrent with IORT. IORT was begun only after obtaining a histologic diagnosis and prior to the completion of any anastomosis. Necrotizing pancreatitis occurred in the treated group. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival of the nonrandomized control and treated groups.\r"

Polyamines (i.e., putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are essential for growth and differentiation. The concentration of polyamines is elevated in rapidly proliferating normal tissues and in some cancers. The presence of GR in human colon cancers has been previously reported. The purpose of the present study was twofold: (1) to determine whether polyamine levels are elevated in colon cancers and in adjacent normal colon mucosa compared to colon mucosa from patients without cancer; and (2) to examine the relationship between polyamine levels and GR in colon cancers. Polyamine levels in colon cancers were significantly higher than in the normal colon mucosa from the same patients. The polyamines, spermidine and spermine, were significantly higher in colon mucosa from patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer. Spermidine and the spermidine:spermine ratio, an index of cell proliferation, were increased in colon cancers with GR compared to cancers without GR. There were no significant correlations between polyamine levels and the following: patient age, CEA level, site of cancer, stage, or differentiation. Because polyamine levels are increased in colon mucosa from patients with cancer, measurement of polyamines may detect patients at risk for subsequent development of colon cancer. Increased levels of polyamines in colon cancers with GR is evidence that gastrin may play a trophic role in human colon cancers.\r"

There were 136 air-transported patients versus 194 ground-transported patients. The groups were similar in trauma scores, ages, mechanism of injury, and organ systems injured. There was a statistically significant survival advantage for air-transported patients with trauma scores between 10 and 5 (82.8% survival vs. 53.5%, p = less than 0.001). The time interval between accident and admission to the authors' institution was similar for both groups. Important therapeutic interventions contributing to better survival by the air-transported group included higher incidences of endotracheal intubation (50% vs. 25%), blood transfusions (32% vs. 10%), larger volumes of electrolyte fluid (3.3 L per patient vs. 2.1 L per patient) as well as the use of MAST trousers (60.3% vs. 34.9%). Transport charges for both ground and air services were similar. However, helicopter charges met only 15% of the operational budget of the aeromedical service. The remainder of the costs were generated from hospital patient revenues. Overall, total hospital charges were similar for both groups and were influenced by the variability of length of stay, particularly for orthopedic patients.\r"

Ibuprofen did not increase survival in this model. Heparin protected against adhesions in animals with an ischemic ileum of limb and without solid feces.

This condition requires expeditious evaluation and prompt surgical intervention in order to improve patient survival. The experience at the authors' institution from 1971 to 1987 includes 41 patients who sustained acute traumatic tear of the thoracic aorta and reached the hospital alive. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the surgical management of this injury with regards to mortality rate and the incidence of spinal cord injury. Five patients died from exsanguination before definitive repair could be undertaken. Thirty-six patients had repair of traumatic aortic tear in the area of the isthmus. Nine patients were operated upon with the clamp and sew technique, 20 patients had a heparin-bonded shunt placed, and seven patients were treated by repair with cardiopulmonary bypass. There were five operative deaths that were not related to the technique employed. Two patients without preoperative evidence of spinal cord injury developed paraparesis. No patient had postoperative paraplegia. Despite rapid transport, expeditious evaluation, and emergency thoracotomy, some patients die from exsanguination prior to definitive repair. Even with the provision of distal aortic perfusion during clamping, the risk of spinal cord injury is not eliminated.\r"

In three patients a partial sternectomy was carried out in conjunction with the rib resections. Chest wall skeletal defects were reconstructed with Prolene mesh, which was placed under tension. Soft tissue reconstruction utilized selected portions of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous territory with fasciocutaneous extensions beyond the muscle itself. Primary healing was obtained in all patients and secondary procedures were not required. The average hospitalization was 23 days. All patients survived the resection and reconstruction and were alive 30 days after operation. In selected patients the preservation of a portion of the innervated muscle in situ or the transfer of the muscle with the preservation of its resting length has maintained the majority of the muscle function.\r"

PTFE anastomoses to canine carotid arteries (noncuff grafts) were compared with grafts with vein cuffs interposed proximally and distally between the graft and native artery. This technique has been suggested clinically for below-knee PTFE femoropopliteal reconstruction. Twelve dogs received aspirin for 1 week before operation, which was continued after each animal received bilateral cuff and noncuff 4-mm PTFE grafts. At sacrifice, after 3-12 weeks, graft patency was assessed and luminal diameters measured with ophthalmic calipers at three sites along the anastomoses and 1 mm proximal or distal to graft toe (A' diameter). Specimens were perfusion fixed at arterial pressure for gross and histologic study; selected arteries were additionally fixed with 4% buffered glutaraldehyde, stored at 4 C, and examined immunochemically using antimyosin antibody immunopurified for smooth muscle. Overall patency of noncuff grafts in 11 long-term surviving dogs was 4 of 11; patency of the cuff grafts was 7 of 11. Regardless of graft thrombosis, antibody positive cellular proliferation occurred mainly at noncuffed PTFE anastomoses. Luminal encroachment was predominantly due to subintimal proliferation of cells highly reactive to smooth muscle derived antibody. JNIH was most prominent 1 mm distal to the graft toe (A' distal diameter). Average A' for noncuff grafts was 1.82 mm +/- 0.97 SEM; average A' diameter for cuff grafts was 3.41 mm +/- 0.74 SEM (p less than 0.001). Vein cuff inhibition of proliferation of smooth muscle or cells derived from smooth muscle possibly relates to wider distribution of kinetic energy (less compliance mismatch) or to interposition of venous endothelium.\r"

However, the only cases of severe and disabling chronic encephalopathy arose after PCS (p = 0.049). Actuarial curves of chronic encephalopathy showed that the maximum rate of encephalopathy (18%) in the DSRS group was reached 27 months after shunt surgery, whereas this value was reached and passed in PCS group only 4 months after shunt. Chronic encephalopathy occurred for a total duration of 20.1 months after PCS and only 11.1 months afer DSRS (p = 0.003) and occupied 46.3% of the follow-p of PCS patients, as contrasted to 18.7% of the follow-up of DSRS patients (p = 0.0001).

  ".W": "The effect of sepsis on the intrinsic contractile status of the myocardium is best examined in the awake, closed-chest animal with intact circulation because anesthesia, open thoracotomy, and circulatory support are all known to affect hemodynamics. To fulfill these criteria, 18 adult dogs were chronically studied in the awake state after instrumentation with left ventricular high-fidelity pressure catheters and ultrasonic dimension transducers to measure left ventricular transmural pressure and minor axis dimension. This allowed computer assessment of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship in the control state and at intervals following cecal ligation in one group of dogs. A second group of control animals was studied over variable time intervals without cecal ligation to evaluate the temporal stability and reproducibility of the animal model and the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship. Evaluation of contractility by use of the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship was essential because this relationship is a sensitive indicator of the intrinsic myocardial contractile state while remaining insensitive to the wide swings in preload and after load that are commonly seen in sepsis. In the control group of dogs, the temporal consistency and stability of the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship in this model was confirmed; no significant changes in the slope and dimension-axis intercept were demonstrated over the study interval. In the septic group of dogs, however, the intrinsic myocardial contractility significantly deteriorated as the mean slope of the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship (mmHg/mm) decreased from 16.87 +/- 0.85 to 12.79 +/- 1.67 over 120 hours following cecal ligation. Intrinsic contractility of the heart during sepsis was therefore isolated for the first time from the widely variant loading conditions seen during sepsis by pressure-dimension analyses in the chronically instrumented, awake, closed-chest canine with intact circulation.\r"

This preoperative transfusion regimen and careful perioperative management permits safe elective cholecystectomy in children with sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".W": "The factors influencing survival for patients with cancer of the liver were studied by reviewing the records of 414 patients operated on in a private oncology practice. Approximately half (47%) had colorectal metastasis; 17% had metastatic breast carcinoma, 14% had malignant hepatoma, 5% had metastatic melanoma, and the remainder had a variety of primary cancers. Eighty-two per cent of all patients had advanced liver disease when first diagnosed. One quarter of the patients had some type of resection; the remainder had abdominal exploration plus insertion of an infusion catheter into the hepatic artery. The postoperative mortality rate after liver resection for 108 patients was 6.5%. After resection, the most important prognostic factor influencing survival was the presence or absence of extrahepatic metastases. When possible, resection was by far the best treatment available, and the best results were seen in patients who had resection of a solitary lesion. For advanced disease, when resection was not possible, intra-arterial chemotherapy, primarily with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), was associated with response rates of 36% for colorectal cancer, 45% for breast cancer, 13% for hepatocellular cancer, 12% for melanoma, and 14% for metastases from other primary sites. The patients who responded to infusion lived longer than those who did not respond. For example, at 18 months, 26% of the responders with colorectal cancer were alive, as were 50% of the responders with breast cancer and 40% of the responders with hepatocellular cancer. In contrast, at 18 months, there were no survivors among the nonresponders with colorectal, breast, or hepatocellular cancer. For those patients treated solely by infusion chemotherapy, the extent of disease in the liver was the most reliable factor in predicting the length of survival. However, very few patients treated in this manner lived longer than 3 years.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the anorectal angle was preserved after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, a simple, safe, low-radiation, real-time method of imaging the anorectum was developed. A cylindrical balloon was placed in the neorectum and anal canal and filled with a solution of 99mTc in water. A gamma camera then imaged the angulation of the balloon while the subject was at rest, during sphincteric squeeze, and during a Valsalva maneuver. Thirteen healthy volunteers and six patients were studied after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. An angle was identified in all controls and patients. In the lateral decubitus position at rest, the mean anorectal angle in controls (102 +/- 18 degrees; SD) and anopouch angle in patients (108 +/- 19 degrees) were similar (p = 0.3). Sitting straightened the angle in both groups (p less than 0.03), whereas sphincteric squeeze and a Valsalva maneuver sharpened the angle in both the sitting and standing positions (p less than 0.03). In the lateral decubitus position, however, the pouch group was less able to sharpen the angle than were the controls (p = 0.04). In controls, the anorectal junction descended during sitting and elevated during squeeze (p less than 0.03), but this did not occur in the pouch group. In conclusion, maneuvers favoring or stressing continence (squeeze, Valsalva) sharpened the anorectal angle and elevated the pelvic floor, whereas a maneuver favoring defecation (sitting) straightened the angle and caused the pelvic floor to descend. After ileal-anal anastomosis, the angle and its movements (except those while lying) were similar to controls. Elevation of the pelvic floor during squeeze, however, was decreased, indicating a decreased mobility of the pelvic floor after operation.\r"

  ".W": "A decade has passed since Martin and associates presented the first series of endorectal ileal pull-through (PT) procedures with straight ileoanal anastomosis for treatment of ulcerative colitis and polyposis. During the ensuing years, several medical centers have reported their results using the PT. Although some children have experienced good results, the majority of adults and children have had severe problems associated with high stool frequency, urgency, and incontinence. Between 1977 and 1987, 12 patients underwent colectomy and straight PT for ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis under the direction of a single surgeon. In this group, the average number of stools varied from six to 45 movements per 24 hours (mean, 18). In seven patients, high stool frequency (mean, 24 per 24 hours), partial fecal incontinence, and urgency that led to moderate to severe limitation in physical, social, work, and sexual activities made it necessary to convert the straight PT to an ileal reservoir. For each of these patients, the ileal PT segment was separated from the rectal muscle cuff, a lateral isoperistaltic reservoir was constructed, and the ileoanal anastomosis was re-established in a one-stage operation. One additional patient decided to return to a conventional ileostomy. All seven patients who underwent conversion to a PT with reservoir had no major complications, and each improved markedly in their clinical status. Daytime stool frequency was reduced by a mean of approximately 50%, whereas nocturnal frequency was decreased by a mean of 60%. Incontinence and fecal urgency were relieved significantly. In conclusion, for patients who develop problems with a straight PT procedure and who desire to avoid a permanent ileostomy, conversion to a PT with a lateral ileal reservoir is a valuable alternative with low risk and a high likelihood of success.\r"

This study was done to determine how vulnerable the smoke-injured lung is to fluid accumulation when crystalloids are infused rapidly. Mongrel dogs were exposed to smoke and 10% body-weight Ringer's lactate in three groups: (I) fluid only, (II) smoke only, and (III) smoke and fluid. The increase in wet-dry lung weight ratio was 2% in Group I, 28% in Group II, and 42% in Group III, consistent with pulmonary edema present only in Group III. The decrease in colloid oncotic pressure was similar in both of the groups that were given fluid, and the rise in the surface tension minimum of lung extracts was similar in both of the groups that were exposed to smoke. The smoke-injured lung loses the ability to protect itself when challenged with fluid. Reduced oncotic pressure is not responsible. Changes in microvascular pressure, endothelial and epithelial damage, and surfactant inactivation interact to cause this increase in extravascular lung water.\r"

The alveolar capillary permeability index is increased 1.8-fold after a 3-hour injury (0.30 to 0.54, p less than 0.05). Gravimetric analysis shows a similar 1.5-fold increase in wet lung weights at 3 hours (0.35% vs. 0.51% of total body weight, p less than 0.05). Histologic features assessed by quantitative morphometric analysis include significant intra-alveolar hemorrhage (0.57 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02 RBC/alveolus at 6 hours, p less than 0.001); endothelial cell disruption (28.11% vs. 4.3%, p less than 0.001); and marked, early neutrophil infiltration (7.45 +/- 0.53 vs. 0.83 +/- 0.18 PMN/hpf at 3 hours, p less than 0.001). The cerulein peptide itself, a cholecystokinin (CCK) analog, is naturally occurring and is not toxic and in several in vitro settings including exposure to pulmonary artery endothelial cells, Type II epithelial cells, and an ex vivo perfused lung preparation. The occurrence of this ARDS-like acute lung injury with acute pancreatitis provides an excellent experimental model to investigate mechanisms and mediators involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS.\r"

Ipsilateral extracranial carotid artery disease was present in 23 of 33 patients (70%) who had carotid arteriography. Sixteen patients had carotid endarterectomy following their CRAO (Group I) and 50 did not (Group II). Seven of the 40 patients available for follow-up in Group II had a subsequent stroke (mean follow-up: 54 months). Of the seven Group II patients shown to have associated carotid disease (Group IIs), three (43%) had a subsequent stroke during follow-up (mean: 28.3 months) compared to zero in Group I (p = 0.033; mean follow-up: 18.7 months). Because of the strong association between CRAO and ipsilateral carotid artery disease and because of the significantly higher incidence of subsequent ipsilateral stroke in CRAO patients with carotid disease who did not undergo endarterectomy, thorough evaluation of the carotid arteries followed by carotid endarterectomy, if indicated, is warranted in CRAO patients who have no other obvious etiology for the occlusion.\r"

A panel of eight specialists representing vascular surgery, neurology, and neurosurgery were presented with the history, physical findings, and noninvasive test results (GEE-OPG and duplex scan) of 85 patients. They were asked to make an anatomic prediction of the status of each carotid artery (170 arteries) as to whether the bifurcation was normal, ulcerated, had a hemodynamically significant stenosis, or was occluded. The predictions were then prospectively evaluated and correlated with angiographic findings; 159 of 170 (93.5%) carotid arteries were accurately characterized; 73 of 80 (91%) symptomatic carotid arteries and 86 of 90 (95.5%) asymptomatic arteries were correctly characterized; 61 of 61 (100%) stenoses of hemodynamic significance, nine of 14 (64.3%) ulcerations without stenosis, and 18 of 18 (100%) of total occlusions were accurately identified by the panel. Twenty-nine patients have subsequently had 32 carotid endarterectomies without angiography, and the predicted lesion was confirmed at the time of exploration. The combination of clinical assessment and noninvasive testing, particularly duplex scanning, when performed in a laboratory with validated accuracy may with defined qualification be safely used as a substitute for contrast angiography.\r"

It is postulated that routine computerized tomography (CT) at regular intervals during inpatient rehabilitation may assist in the discovery of these lesions. This study explores the value of obtaining sequential CT scans in a population where it is often difficult to objectively assess progress and potential outcome. This series is based on 47 patients with traumatic head injuries who were admitted to a comprehensive inpatient head injury unit over a two-year period. CT scans were performed on each patient by prospective protocol at admission, one month, and three months later, unless marked clinical improvement was observed. Nine of 41 patients (22%) scanned required neurosurgical intervention for ventricular enlargement, subdural hematoma, or cerebral abscess after admission to the unit. Two of the nine (22%) had changes noted on preadmission scans and seven (78%) had pathologic changes detected on CT only after admission to rehabilitation. Thus, significant numbers of neurologic lesions were identified in the postacute phase during the inpatient rehabilitation program. Serial CT scanning may allow earlier diagnosis and thereby minimize further brain injury in the rehabilitation setting.\r"

Eighteen severely head-injured patients were assessed during acute rehabilitation for both the extent of agitation and level of cognitive functioning. Agitation was measured by the Agitated Behavior Scale developed by Corrigan. Simultaneous independent measurements of cognitive functioning were obtained from the Orientation Group Monitoring System and Mini-Mental State. Agitation was significantly correlated with both measures of cognitive functioning, indicating that as cognition improved, agitation diminished. Agitation was partitioned into high and low levels, and cognitive functioning was partitioned into low, middle, and high levels for each of the two measures of cognitive functioning. Chi-square analysis of the distribution of agitation and cognition indicated significant differentiation, with high agitation prevalent in low levels of cognition, and low agitation prevalent in high levels of cognition. Patients in the middle level of cognition were equally likely to demonstrate high and low agitation. Further descriptive analysis indicated that improvement from low levels of cognition preceded improved agitation, and improved agitation preceded clearing from posttraumatic amnesia. These results provide equivocal support for the long-held clinical observation that a period of pronounced confusion and agitation represents a discrete stage of recovery from traumatic head injury.\r"

The comparison was performed in order to determine the limits for normal-usual values for sensory nerve conduction latency values of the median nerve in the area of the wrist, using the segmental stimulation technique in 1 cm increments described by Kimura. Kimura has recognized 0.5msec as the criterion for abnormality. In this study the segmental latency value of 0.4msec was also found to fall outside the range of normal-usual values. Although 0.5msec provides a higher degree of specificity (97%), its sensitivity is limited (54%). By contrast, 0.4msec provides an enhanced sensitivity (81%) while maintaining what we feel is an acceptable amount of specificity (81%). Although the predictive accuracy of 0.4msec (77%) is less than that of 0.5msec (93%), both values have merit in confirming CTS. With 0.5msec the clinician can be assured that relatively few normal individuals will be included in the CTS group; however, use of this value may result in a high number of false negative results. In contrast, 0.4msec affords the clinician the increased sensitivity needed to make a diagnosis of CTS in those cases where the conduction deficit is subtle and highly localized; but associated with its use is the possibility of false positive results. In both cases, a thorough history and clinical examination are necessary to ensure correct interpretation of the nerve conduction study results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to clarify our understanding of physiologic and subjective responses to work of this type, two experiments were conducted using legs and/or arms. In the first, incremental cycle ergometry was done with the arms (A), legs (L), and combined, in which either 10% (A-10) or 25% (A-25) of the power output (PO) was done by the arms. Peak rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR) were significantly lower for A, but the other three conditions did not differ significantly. Ventilatory breakpoint (VB) was significantly higher for A-10 than for L. The second study used 60 minutes of constant-load work at a PO of approximately 115% of the PO at which the VB occurred in the L incremental test, to stimulate an aerobic training session. During the 60 minutes, VO2 and cardiac output were significantly higher, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly lower for A-25 than for L, with A-10 values generally failing between the two. The HR-SBP products and ratings of perceived exertion were quite similar for the three modes. Thus, assigning some of the PO to the arms allowed a greater metabolic load to be maintained with no greater cardiovascular or subjective strain, suggesting that this type of exercise might be valuable for aerobic conditioning, cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, and weight control.\r"

  ".W": "Computer simulation is a process that appears to have wide application in many disciplines. Electromyographic (EMG) interference patterns can be computer-synthesized by inputting parameters of individual motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) such as amplitude, duration, and phases, and recruitment parameters of number of motor units, and the firing rate and its standard deviation. The resulting simulated EMG interference patterns can then be used to test hypotheses regarding the effect of alteration of the individual MUAP parameters on the interference pattern. An example of the usefulness of simulation is demonstrated by the analysis of the simulated patterns by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which indicates that the major frequency band in the FFT results from the duration of the individual phases of the MUAP. The motor unit's recruitment rate is superimposed on the FFT envelope in the low-frequency end. The variability of the firing rate influences the distinctness of the low-frequency peaks. The MUAP amplitude and number of motor units in the recruitment pattern are reflected in the FFT power. Simulation appears to be a useful tool for further investigation and development of EMG signal analysis techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The effectiveness of using 2-inch and 4-inch convoluted foam overlays to protect children from developing pressure sores was investigated in 13 healthy children ranging in age from ten weeks to 13.5 years. Interface pressures were measured under the occipital, sacral, and scapular areas of children as they lay on a standard mattress, then on 2-inch and 4-inch foam overlays. The differences in pressures between the occiput and scapula, occiput and sacrum, and scapula and sacrum were significant (p less than .001), with the highest pressures recorded under the occipital area. Occipital pressures decreased from 45.7mmHg on the standard mattress to 22.3mmHg on the 4-inch overlay in ages 0 to 2, 54.3mmHg to 30.5mmHg in ages 2 to 10, and 78.0mmHg to 42.4mmHg in ages 10 to 14. Sacral pressures were highest in older and larger children, increasing from 17mm Hg in ages 0 to 2 to 34mmHg in ages 10 to 14, and when body surface area was greater than 1m2. These results indicate that the site of greatest pressure changes with increasing age from the occipital area to the sacral area. Therefore, different pressure relief considerations are necessary in treating pediatric patients than in managing pressure under adults.\r"

One explanation of the referral of acute pain to a site of chronic pain is the convergence-projection theory, which hypothesizes that pain signals of visceral and somatic origin converge at some point in the sensory pathway. Upon reaching the cortex, these signals are interpreted as coming from the afferents which have previously excited this pathway. In this case an extensive gastrointestinal diagnostic evaluation was pursued unsuccessfully before the latissimus dorsi muscle strain was diagnosed. Outpatient therapy of spray and stretch combined with a home stretching program produced a prompt and persistent resolution of the symptoms.\r"

EMG studies revealed trains of positive sharp waves with needle movement in all muscles studied. Nerve conduction studies, radiographs, and laboratory studies were all unremarkable. We recruited eight additional family members who underwent a screening EMG of five muscles. Four patients had trains of positive sharp waves present in all five muscles. To our knowledge, this is the first report confirming the findings of Wiechers and Johnson. We concur with them that the abnormality appears to be genetically transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. Although without clinical significance, it is important for electromyographers to be aware of this entity so as not to mistakenly ascribe serious neuromuscular disease to these patients.\r"

The reported incidence of cerebral atrophy after severe head injury is significant. However, the incidence of late morbidity and mortality from acute subdural hematoma is not well documented. Acute subdural hemorrhage is attributed to rupture of bridging cerebral veins. In the presence of cerebral atrophy, the bridging veins are stretched and traverse a greater distance in the subdural space. They are therefore more susceptible to tearing with minor trauma. In addition, there is a delayed tamponade effect since the atrophied brain is shrunken away from the inner table of the skull. A case report is presented which suggests that survivors of severe head injury may be at increased risk for the development of acute subdural hematomas from relatively minor injuries months or even years after their initial trauma.\r"

Metabolic data were collected at rest and during three levels of exercise, using both the traditional mouthpiece and the interface designed for this study. Exercise intensities were matched for both experimental conditions. Subjects exercised using an electrically braked ergometer configured for arm pedaling. A modification in a Beckman Metabolic Cart allowed for the collection of values with a standard mouthpiece and low-flow interface. Validity of the interface was evaluated using a concurrent, criterion procedure. Correlations of mouthpiece vs interface data during rest and across each exercise level for oxygen consumption were high (r = 0.94 to 0.84; p less than 0.05). Similar results were obtained for carbon dioxide production (r = 0.92 to 0.85; p less than 0.05).\r"

Multiple discrete high-signal foci (pattern A) were found in patients with toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Large, bilateral patchy to confluent high-signal areas within the white matter (pattern B) represented a white matter encephalitis secondary to cytomegalovirus or human immunodeficiency virus. Generalized enlargement of the cortical sulci and ventricles (pattern C) probably reflected atrophic changes from the chronic human immunodeficiency virus infection and prolonged debilitating illness. Solitary high-signal-intensity lesions (pattern D) suggested a nonviral opportunistic infection. Differential diagnosis of brain abnormalities in patients with AIDS can be assisted by recognition of these characteristic patterns.\r"

We describe a simple and reliable clinical sign of total unilateral loss of horizontal semicircular canal function: one large or several small oppositely directed, compensatory, refixation saccades elicited by rapid horizontal head rotation toward the lesioned side. Using magnetic search coils to measure head and eye movement, we have validated this sign in 12 patients who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy.\r"

In patients with one metastasis, the posterior fossa was involved in 50% of patients when the primary tumor was pelvic (prostate or uterus) or gastrointestinal, but it was involved in only 10% of patients with other primary tumors. Hemispheral metastases preferred the anatomic \"watershed areas\" (29% of the brain surface contained 37% of the metastases), indicating that tumoral microemboli tend to lodge in the capillaries of the distal parts of the superficial arteries. The charts of 134 patients with brain metastases from a primary tumor originating outside the lung revealed that the incidence of lung and spine metastases was the same, whether the primary tumor was pelvic or gastrointestinal or from another site. These data suggest that the high incidence of subtentorial lesions in patients with pelvic and gastrointestinal primary tumors cannot be explained by arterial embolization alone, and that this peculiar distribution is probably not explained by seeding of the brain through Batson's plexus.\r"

As expressed by the kappa index, interobserver agreement was rather low, ranging from 30% to 50%. Sensory and mental functions turned out to be the most variable. The kappa indexes reached values above 85%, when raters who differed by no more than one point were considered as agreeing. A point difference on the scale of, at most, two units seemed to be a reliable index of clinical change. Moreover, these results pointed to the necessity for a specific training program for raters and for periodic control of interobserver variability in multicenter surveys.\r"

Generalized status myoclonicus occurred in 13 patients after cardiorespiratory arrest and in six patients after toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Thirteen patients died, four survived in a chronic vegetative state, and two recovered without any permanent neurologic sequelae. Generalized status myoclonicus was preceded by generalized tonic-clonic seizures or generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus in six patients (32%). The implications of these findings are discussed and a hypothesis that generalized status myoclonicus is a fragment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus is proposed. Generalized status myoclonicus is a grave prognostic indicator that is often not compatible with useful recovery in spite of all therapeutic efforts. The final outcome is related to the underlying disease process. In our study, complete neurologic recovery was observed in two patients (11%).\r"

  ".W": "If intraocular pressure plays a role in producing visual field loss in normal-tension glaucoma, there may be a possible benefit from therapeutic efforts to lower the pressure. To see whether pressure plays a role in the production of damage, we studied 14 cases of normal-tension glaucoma with asymmetric intraocular pressure (1- to 6-mm Hg interocular difference in pressure). In 12 of these 14 cases, we found that glaucomatous cupping and field loss (damage) was greater in the eye with higher pressure. This statistically significant correspondence of the higher pressure with the greater visual damage suggests that the level of pressure is a factor in producing optic nerve damage. Other factors also must contribute to account for the few instances in which damage asymmetry did not reflect interocular pressure-difference and for the occurrence of injury at such low levels of pressure in the first place. Although benefit may be expected from therapeutic lowering of pressure in this condition, the degree of benefit, as well as the side effects from treatment required for successful lowering of pressure, remains to be documented by a future clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the peripapillary scleral and choroidal halos and crescents in the two eyes of 42 patients with unilateral glaucoma. In most cases, the edge of the three tissue layers (the retinal pigment epithelium [RPE], the choroid, and the sclera) that encircle the optic nerve head of the glaucomatous eye superimposed exactly on the mirror images of the edges in the fellow nonglaucomatous eye. Although the size of the peripapillary crescent or halo was the same in both eyes, it and the scleral rim were often more conspicuous in the eye with glaucomatous damage because the tissue edges were seen more easily through the reduced thickness of nerve fiber layer tissue. There were nine exceptions. In five cases, the peripapillary choroidal crescent (the area of choroid not covered by RPE) was larger in the glaucomatous eye. In four eyes, however, the crescent was larger in the nonglaucomatous eye, although the magnitude of the asymmetry was less in these four cases. Thus, in late stages of optic nerve damage, there was some RPE atrophy, but in most cases of glaucoma, the area of bared choroid was the inherent anatomic configuration of the optic nerve exit canal.\r"

Two studies were done to determine if patients who develop CNS effects while using timolol maleate would improve with betaxolol hydrochloride. In one study, 18 patients with CNS symptoms during timolol therapy were switched to betaxolol. Sixteen of the 18 patients noted symptomatic improvement with betaxolol. The second study involved seven patients with CNS symptoms during timolol therapy who were entered into a double-masked cross-over study. In two patients CNS symptoms resolved with betaxolol; in three patients symptoms improved; and in one patient symptoms worsened with betaxolol. Although factors influencing beta-blocker activity in the CNS are not well understood, there may be some advantage to a selective agent.\r"

No medications were applied to either eye during the control day. Following baseline measurements on the day of treatment, one drop of topical 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride was placed on one eye and a placebo (vehicle) was placed on the fellow eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, pupil size, blood pressure, and pulse rate were assessed on both days at the baseline and 1, 3, 5, and 7 hours later. The 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride lowered the mean IOP (+/- SD) a maximum of 6.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg (37.3% +/- 20.4%) from the baseline on the day of treatment. A statistically significant 2.7 +/- 3.4-mm Hg (14.9% +/- 19.0%) mean IOP decrease from the baseline was noted in the contralateral placebo-treated eye. No significant changes in the coefficient of outflow, blood pressure, or heart rate were noted. Eyelid retraction, conjunctival blanching, and mydriasis were frequently noted in eyes treated with 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride.\r"
