We examined the fine specificity of three independently derived encephalitogenic T-cell clones using synthetic polypeptides derived from portions of the N-terminal sequence of MBP. These clones appear functionally identical; they all respond to an epitope in the N-terminal nine amino acid residues in association with the same class II (I-A) molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Both the N-terminal acetyl moiety and the first residue (Ala) are necessary for recognition. Only N-terminal MBP peptides recognized by these clones were found to cause encephalomyelitis (EAE) in vivo. These results show that the N-terminal MBP-specific T lymphocytes that mediate autoimmune encephalomyelitis are a small population with a limited repertoire; they all recognise the same combination of MHC and target.\r"

Administration of IL-1 in vivo causes fever and synthesis of acute phase proteins. In vitro they have been shown to cause cartilage and bone resorption, and to stimulate fibroblasts and chondrocytes to make prostaglandins and latent collagenase. IL-1 has therefore been proposed to be an important inflammatory mediator and may be involved in the destruction of cartilage and bone that is a feature of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases of joints. We therefore looked for IL-1 receptors on connective tissue cells which might be targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the iodination, to high specific activity and with retention of full biological potency, of the two types of natural porcine IL-1. These ligands have been used to demonstrate high affinity dissociation constant (approximately 10(-10) M) specific binding sites on pig chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, human dermal fibroblasts and murine osteoblasts (3,000-5,000 sites per cell). Most interestingly, the two different Il-1 proteins show a similar affinity for a common class of receptors.\r"

These include bone resorption, fibroblast proliferation, acute phase protein release from hepatocytes, cartilage breakdown and fever. This spectrum of activities is consistent with a role for IL-1 as a mediator of inflammation. Recently, sequence data have shown that there are at least two members of the IL-1 family; these distantly related proteins have been termed IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. We have found previously that both murine T cells and fibroblasts possess a relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 80,000 (80K) plasma membrane receptor for human IL-1 beta. We show here that the receptor for IL-1 alpha on both murine and human cells is identical to that for IL-1 beta. This result raises the issue of what separation, if any, there might be between the biological activities of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta.\r"

On the surface of human T lymphocytes, Ti is non-covalently associated with three invariant proteins, designated CD3-gamma, -delta, and -epsilon. It has been suggested that Ti is obligatory for CD3 expression. But a T leukaemia cell line, IL-2 (interleukin 2) dependent T-cell clones established from fetal blood and IL-2 dependent cell lines established from immunodeficiency patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome and ectodermal dysplasia syndrome have recently been shown to express CD3, but not Ti (detected due to monoclonal antibody WT31). These lymphocytes may express the product of the T-cell antigen receptor gamma (TCR-gamma) gene, rather than the alpha/beta heterodimer, in association with CD3. Preliminary studies suggested that T cells expressing CD3 but lacking Ti are present in low frequency in normal lymphoid tissues. Here we show that in normal blood and thymus CD3+, WT31-T cells express neither CD4 nor CD8. The low frequency (less than 0.2-0.9% of total thymocytes) of CD3+, WT31- cells in the thymus suggests that this population does not represent a major stage of thymic development and may be a distinct lineage of T cells.\r"

Native vWF is a disulphide-bonded homopolymer; the monomeric subunits, of apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) 220,000 (220K) are derived from an intracellular precursor estimated at 260-275K. Multimer assembly is preceded by the formation of dimers, linked near their C-termini, which then assemble into filamentous polymers. The importance of the removal of the large vWF pro-polypeptide during multimer assembly, and whether this or other stages of the complex post-translational processing require components specific to endothelial cells or megakaryocytes, is unknown. Here we report an analysis of the complete sequence of pre-pro-vWF and expression of the molecule in heterologous cells. The vWF precursor is composed of several repeated subdomains. When expressed in COS and CHO cells, it is cleaved and assembled into biologically active high relative molecular mass disulphide bonded multimers. This suggests that the information for assembly of this complex molecule resides largely within its primary structure.\r"

Enhanced expression and allelic alterations of the c-myc oncogene were found in three HCC out of nine. Variations in the size of the c-myc transcripts, ranging from 2.0 kilobases (kb) to 5.6 kb, as well as in the level of c-myc gene expression, 5-50-fold higher than in adjacent liver tissues, were observed among the three HCC. Rearrangements of the c-myc locus were either upstream of the gene or within the first intron. Cloning and sequencing of the break-point region from one of the three tumours showed that the c-myc gene was truncated and joined to a unique cellular sequence of unknown function. WHV DNA was not integrated near the c-myc coding exons, excluding a direct role of the virus in c-myc activation. The novel type of rearrangement and activation of the c-myc gene, reported here in liver tumours of hepatitis virus infected animals, appears strikingly similar to those resulting from chromosomal translocations in human Burkitt's lymphomas, acute B- and T-cell leukaemias and mouse plasmacytomas.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages, granulocytes and many lymphocytes express or secrete receptors for the Fc domain of immunoglobulins (Ig). These Fc receptors (FcRs) are heterogeneous and can be distinguished on the basis of their cellular distribution and specificities for different immunoglobulin isotypes. Although their functions are not completely understood, FcRs are known to be involved in triggering various effector cell functions and in regulating differentiation and development of B-cells. One of the best characterized is the mouse macrophage-lymphocyte receptor for IgG1 and IgG2b (ref. 5). On macrophages, this FcR mediates the endocytosis of antibody-antigen complexes via coated pits and coated vesicles, the phagocytosis of Ig-coated particles, and the release of various inflammatory and cytotoxic agents. It is possible that the receptor possesses an intrinsic ligand-activated ion channel activity responsible for some of these functions. The IgG1/IgG2b FcR has been isolated and shown to be a transmembrane glycoprotein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 47,000-60,000 (47-60 K) containing four N-linked oligosaccharide chains and a large (greater than 10K) cytoplasmic domain. It is also immunologically indistinguishable from the murine Ly-17 alloantigen which, in turn, is tightly linked to the Mls lymphocyte activation locus. Here we describe the isolation and characterisation of a complementary DNA clone encoding the whole of the IgG1/IgG2b FcR expressed by the mouse macrophage-like cell line P388D1. The receptor is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and, like Ly-17, maps to the distal portion of chromosome 1. cDNA probes detect one or two mRNA species in FcR+ macrophage and B-cell lines, but not in FcR- cells or a receptor-deficient variant derived from a FcR+ B-cell line. Finally, DNA hybridization analysis indicates the receptor gene is partially deleted or rearranged in the FcR- variant.\r"

Such studies with B lymphocytes, the precursors of antibody-secreting cells, are hampered by the difficulty in generating phenotypically mature, antigen-reactive lines from defined cell populations. One method is to use acutely transforming retroviruses, which can transform B-lineage lymphocytes in vitro. However, Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuLV) infection of murine bone marrow cells in vitro yields mostly immature B-cell lines, and infection of murine bone marrow cells with murine sarcoma viruses carrying ras related genes produces only immature lymphoid cell lines. Retroviruses which contain ras can immortalize nonlymphoid cells without causing loss of mature phenotypic characteristics. We used ras-containing Kirsten sarcoma virus (KiSV) pseudotyped with an amphotropic MuLV helper virus, to infect a purified population of mature, hapten-binding murine splenic B lymphocytes, aiming to generate mature B-cell lines to use as models for the study of B-cell growth and differentiation physiology. Immortalized B-cell lines which retain the same mature phenotype as the starting population, including hapten-specific binding, were produced. This is the first demonstration of a method for immortalizing selected antigen-binding B lymphocytes, and the first example of immortalization of mature B cells in vitro with an acutely transforming ras-containing retrovirus.\r"

Recognition of cells that express nucleoprotein by CTL does not depend on a definite signal sequence within the protein, and the epitopes recognized can be defined with short synthetic peptides in vitro. Haemagglutinin (HA), the major transmembrane protein of the virus, is recognized by a minor population of CTL from infected mice. We have deleted the sequence coding for the N-terminal signal peptide from a complementary DNA encoding HA of the H1 subtype. The signal-deleted HA is detected with antibodies as a short-lived, unglycosylated, intracellular protein. However, CTL raised to the complete molecule recognize cells expressing the signal-deleted HA and vice versa. These results cast doubts on the assumption that CTL recognize the HA molecule only after its insertion into the plasma membrane.\r"

MHC class II-restricted T cells usually recognize degraded or denatured rather than native forms of antigen on the surface of class II-bearing antigen presenting cells. It has recently been shown that short synthetic peptides corresponding to mapped antigenic sites of the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) can render uninfected target cells susceptible to lysis by NP-specific class I-restricted cytolytic T cells (CTL). These and earlier experiments that showed specific recognition of NP deletion mutant transfectants suggest that class I-restricted recognition might also involve processed antigenic fragments. One important issue arising from these studies is whether the model applies not only to viral proteins that are expressed internally (such as NP) but also to antigens normally expressed as integral membrane proteins at the cell surface. We have recently isolated class I-restricted mouse CTL clones that recognize class I gene products of the human MHC (HLA) as antigens in mouse cell HLA-transfectants. Here we show that these anti-HLA CTL can lyse HLA-negative syngeneic mouse cells in the presence of a synthetic HLA peptide. These results suggest that the model applies generally.\r"

Using pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis, we have now determined restriction maps of a major fraction of this area, covering two regions of three million basepairs in total, and used it to determine the position of several probes linked to DMD. The maps establish physical distances between structural changes associated with the DMD phenotype and provide evidence for a CpG-rich island proximal to the area containing translocations and deletions associated with the DMD phenotype.\r"

The heavy-chain V-region gene is composed of variable (VH), diversity (D) and joining (JH) segments; kappa (K) and lambda (lambda) light-chain V-region genes have analogous VL and JL segments. Assembly of Ig V-gene segments, as well as those of the highly related T-cell receptor, is regulated at several levels and shows both stage and tissue specificity; for example Ig heavy-chain V-gene assembly precedes that of Ig light chains during B-cell differentiation. Joining of all classes of V-gene segments involves conserved recognition sequences that are probably targets for a common recombinase. Evidence has been presented suggesting that rearrangement of specific classes of segments is regulated by modulation of their accessibility to the recombinase. To elucidate mechanisms which control V-region gene assembly, we have investigated the effect of flanking gene expression on the frequency at which introduced V-gene segments are assembled in pre-B cell lines. Our findings suggest that transcription may play a direct role in the regulation of immunoglobulin V-gene assembly.\r"

It was found that this intraventricular dose regimen of urokinase did not cause intracranial hemorrhage even though the dogs had recent brain wounds related to transcerebral ventricular catheterization. Mild activation of systemic fibrinolysis, implying passage of the enzyme from ventricle to blood, occurred 4 to 6 hours after each intraventricular injection, but no systemic hemorrhages were seen. This dose regimen also did not cause acute or chronic inflammatory changes in the brain or meninges and did not disturb cerebrospinal fluid circulation.\r"

The neurological status and systemic fibrinolytic profiles were closely monitored, and the changes in clot and ventricular volumes were measured by serial computed tomography (CT) for 3 months. The control animals showed severe neurological impairment for 7 to 9 days. No visible lysis of the intraventricular clots occurred for 5 to 7 days, after which slow clot lysis occurred at a constant rate. Complete lysis of the 10 clots took 38 to 65 days, indicating that canine cerebrospinal fluid normally possessed limited capacity for in situ fibrinolysis. Of the 10 control dogs, 8 developed progressive ventricular enlargement after a transient initial shrinkage parallel with initial clot lysis. Their final ventricular volume at 3 months was as much as 14 times the base line ventricular volume. Necropsy studies disclosed increased basal subarachnoid fibrosis and extensive ependymal and subependymal damage in the lateral ventricular walls of the hydrocephalic dogs. Ten other dogs (UK dogs) were given similar ventricular clot injections. Six hours later, each UK dog was begun on a regimen of 20,000 IU of intraventricular urokinase every 12 hours until solid clots were no longer seen in the ventricles on CT. In all 10 UK dogs, intraventricular urokinase induced complete lysis in 3 to 6 days without causing local or systemic hemorrhages. The neurological status of all 10 dogs also improved promptly. In 8 UK dogs, the ventricles that were initially distended by clots showed rapid shrinkage parallel with thrombolysis to a final volume at 3 months of less than four times the initial ventricular volume. Only 2 animals had persistently large or expanding ventricles. At necropsy, the ependymal and subarachnoid spaces of the UK dogs were remarkably free of damage and fibrosis. The possible mechanisms by which intraventricular urokinase may prevent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus are discussed.\r"

Four of the patients developed their infections in a dermatomal distribution that correlated with the nerve roots manipulated at operation. A spectrum of localized herpes reactivation is demonstrated in this series. The use of corticosteroids and other associated variables are discussed. Like reactivation of herpes simplex after trigeminal nerve operation, we believe reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster can occur in operation of the cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spine.\r"

  ".W": "The antisiphon device (ASD) was designed to prevent excessive negative intracranial pressure and overdrainage with cerebrospinal fluid shunts. It has been recommended for prevention of slit ventricles and extreme shunt dependency. It was used by the author in 40 children and young adults who had low pressure headaches or were judged to be at risk for the development of subdural hematomas because of extreme hydrocephalus, relatively fixed head size, or tall stature. Nine patients encountered problems with adverse symptoms in spite of shunt patency. Four had alarming neurological symptoms of coma or severe headaches after incorporation of ASDs in ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems. With patients in the horizontal position, shunt patency was documented but computed tomography revealed progressive ventriculomegaly when they were kept erect. Symptoms abated and ventricular size diminished after conversion to proximal medium pressure diaphragm or spring-ball valve systems without ASDs. Because long shunt systems with ASDs require adequate hydrostatic columns to initiate flow when patients are erect, it is theorized that such symptoms could have been prevented by placing ASDs farther downstream from the cerebral ventricles.\r"

These were much less revealing than PET, which correlated with microscopic findings of neuronal loss and proliferation of glia. In areas of moderately impaired local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, as revealed by reduced FDG uptake, there was some gliosis, primarily around the numerous senile plaques. In areas of severe metabolic impairment, there was a profound loss of neurons, extensive gliosis, and a diminished appearance of plaques. PET-FDG is a better measure of the severity of Alzheimer's disease than MRI or CT, because it reflects the degree of neuronal pathology.\r"

In the epithelium, the predominant cell type was the OKT8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cell, whereas in the substantia propria, helper T-cells (Leu3a/3b+) equalled suppressor T-cells. T-cells outnumbered B-cells 20-fold; the letter cells were detected only in the substantial propria, particularly in the fornices, and not in the epithelium. Plasma cells, as identified by OKT10 staining, were completely absent except in the accessory lacrimal glands of Krause. Langerhans' cells, identified by OKT6 and HLA-DR (la) staining, were observed in the epithelium of all conjunctival regions. Our findings suggest that the reactivity of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells is heavily damped down by T-lymphocytes, thus allying the conjunctiva to other mucosal membranes and the skin as heavily immunoregulated tissues.\r"

  ".U": "87066396\r", 
  ".W": "The analgesic effect produced by electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation in the rat was dose-dependently antagonized by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intrathecally (i.th) at a dose range of 0.25-4 ng. This effect had an immediate onset and lasted for at least 4 h. CCK-8 per se, however, did not affect baseline tail flick latency. Rats subjected to prolonged EA stimulation developed EA tolerance as well as cross-tolerance to morphine. These tolerances could be postponed or reversed by i.c.v. or i.th injection of antiserum against CCK-8. While CCK-8 antagonized opioid analgesia, it did not affect analgesia induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or norepinephrine (NE). Moreover, CCK-8 antiserum did not alter the basic level of nociception, nor did it potentiate EA analgesia in naive rats. It is concluded that prolonged EA stimulation results in a profound release of opioids which may trigger the release of CCK-8 in the central nervous system to counteract the opioid component of EA analgesia. This mechanism may account, at least in part, for the development of EA tolerance.\r"

Several nonrheumatic disorders such as infections, malignancies, congenital or genetic conditions, orthopedic conditions, and psychological disorders may closely simulate the various rheumatic diseases. The evaluation of children with arthritis rests chiefly on historical and physical findings; radiographs, laboratory tests, and occasionally biopsies also may be helpful. It is particularly important to identify specifically treatable diseases, such as bacterial infections or childhood malignancies, early and to avoid labeling nonrheumatic conditions as rheumatic. Accurate diagnosis of the various rheumatic disease syndromes is important for optimal therapy.\r"

Patients who had CNS dysfunction of unknown etiology had the lowest frequency of abnormal findings (12/33); however, in three of these patients, a previously unsuspected brain malformation was found on CT scan. Patients who had other congenital anomalies had an intermediate proportion of abnormal findings on CT scans (20/30), and in 11 of these scans, a previously unsuspected or only partly suspected brain malformation was diagnosed.

Young children are injured, and occasionally killed, in handgun \"accidents.\" Some young children and many adolescents are murdered with handguns. Like infant mortality, handgun violence in the United States is a medical as well as a social problem. Because of the great lethality of handguns and their very limited ability to provide personal protection, handgun injury can best be reduced by making handguns less available. Handgun control cannot reduce rates of crime or interpersonal assault, but it can reduce the frequency and severity of injury arising from these situations toward the much lower levels found in other countries. The involvement of children in the United States handgun injury epidemic warrants effective pediatrician involvement in efforts toward handgun control.\r"

This induction occurs at PDGF concentrations that are suboptimal for a mitogenic response. In this study we examined the effect of TS on the proliferation of SMC, using a serum-free mitogenesis assay. Addition of either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or purified human platelet TS to quiescent rat vascular SMC did not substantially stimulate mitogenesis; the 30-hr nuclear labeling index increased from a mean of 7% in control cells to 20% for EGF-treated SMC and 17% for cells exposed to TS alone. However, TS and EGF acted synergistically to stimulate DNA synthesis by SMC, increasing the labeling index to 47%. The facilitative effect of TS on EGF-mediated mitogenesis was inhibited by heparin, a known inhibitor of SMC growth and migration that also blocks incorporation of TS into the SMC extracellular matrix. The effect was specific for EGF; TS did not augment the response of cells to insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. These data establish a functional role for cell-derived TS and provide evidence for the presence of an autocrine, growth-supportive mechanism involving the extracellular matrix. In addition, our experiments support the existence of a novel, heparin-sensitive SMC mitogenic pathway and suggest a mechanism whereby heparin-like molecules may inhibit SMC proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Several laboratories have shown that transfected plasmid DNAs containing either of the two known origins of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA replication, oriS or oriL, are replicated in HSV-1-infected cells or in cells cotransfected with virion DNA. I have found that HSV-1 (KOS) DNA digested to completion with the restriction enzyme Xba I is as efficient as intact viral DNA in supporting the in vivo replication of cotransfected plasmids containing oriS. On the basis of this result, several of the Xba I restriction fragments of HSV-1 DNA were cloned into the plasmid vector pUC19, and combinations of cloned DNAs were tested for their ability to supply the trans-acting functions required for HSV origin-dependent replication. A combination of five cloned fragments of HSV-1 can supply all of the necessary functions: Xba I C (coordinates 0.074-0.294), Xba I F (coordinates 0.294-0.453), Xba I E (coordinates 0.453-0.641), Xba I D (coordinates 0.641-0.830), and EcoRI JK (coordinates 0.0-0.086; 0.830-0.865). Transient plasmid replication in this system is dependent on the presence of either oriS or oriL in cis. The plasmid containing Xba I F can be replaced by two smaller plasmids, one of which contains only the gene for the HSV-encoded DNA polymerase, and the other of which contains only the gene for the major DNA binding protein (ICP8). Thus, plasmid DNA replication in this system depends on two of the genes known from genetic studies to be essential for viral DNA replication in infected cells. This system defines a simple complementation assay for cloned fragments of HSV DNA that contain other genes involved in viral DNA replication and should lead to the rapid identification of all such genes.\r"

The aim of the present study was to further examine the influences exercised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; formerly called human T-lymphotropic virus type III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV) on normal human B lymphocytes. An unfractionated protein preparation, made from HIV purified by density gradient centrifugation, was previously shown to induce differentiation of normal human B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In the present analyses, this B-lymphocyte response peaked on day 6 or 7 after culture initiation and was found to be independent of the requirement for monocytes but to require T cells. Responses could also be elicited in cultures of purified B cells by the addition of T cells that had been exposed to HIV antigen. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (puromycin and cycloheximide) abrogated the responses. In contrast to its stimulatory effects, the same virus preparation was previously shown to inhibit polyclonal responses that are normally elicited in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures by a T-dependent stimulus (pokeweed mitogen) and T-independent stimulus (Epstein-Barr virus). The present studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of the HIV antigen studied herein are targeted primarily at the B lymphocytes. The role of T lymphocytes in the HIV antigen-mediated inhibitory effects, although demonstrated, could not be conclusively established as an essential pathway. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which components of HIV exert stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on human B lymphocytes and thereby lead to the dysfunction of these cells in HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "An approach to the problem of inducing tolerance in patients with hemophilia complicated by high-responding antibodies is described. Thus, in four patients with severe hemophilia B and high-responding antibodies against factor IX, it has been possible to modify the immune response by giving high doses of intravenous IgG in combination with cyclophosphamide and factor IX, followed by regular factor IX treatment. In three of the patients, the in vivo recovery and half-life of infused factor IX coagulant activity (IX:C) are now normal, while the fourth patient has been converted to a low responder. Hip replacement surgery has been performed successfully in one patient. The tolerant state in these four patients is characterized, and they have all been found to have complexes between factor IX antigen and a \"new\" antibody without IX:C inhibitory activity. The disappearance rate of the complexed factor IX antigen (i.e., lacking IX:C activity) is considerably prolonged, and the persistence in the circulation of this (probably modified) factor IX molecule may be crucial, since tolerance to factor IX treatment was only induced when immunocomplexes were produced. Since earlier treatment of the patients with cyclophosphamide and factor IX, but without IgG, failed to induce tolerance, it appears to be the IgG that is the prerequisite.\r"

This homology, between two proteins associated with opposing biological functions, suggests possible mechanisms for the immunosuppressive activity of the AIDS virus. Two mechanisms are proposed in which the AIDS virus env protein interferes with IL-2 activity either directly or indirectly. A region of similarity to the purported IL-2 receptor binding site on IL-2 and AIDS virus env is present in the env proteins of other retroviruses associated with immunosuppression. A synthetic peptide vaccine for AIDS is suggested based on the IL-2 receptor binding sequence in AIDS virus env.\r"

  ".W": "Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used to augment range-of-motion, strengthening, and facilitation treatment programs of the muscles surrounding the shoulder. The purposes of this article are 1) to describe the uses of NMES around the shoulder joint as developed through our clinical use and 2) to detail the effects of an NMES program on chronic shoulder subluxation as determined by a clinical study. Because of the complexities of this multiarticular joint, NMES is most useful in the initial phase of the ROM, and stimulated contractions are compromised, relatively, as the humerus moves above the 90-degree horizontal plane. The use of NMES to provide scapular stabilization often entails unwanted alteration of the pressures on the spinal column, occasionally making the treatment program unusable. Electrical stimulation to prevent or correct shoulder subluxation, especially in the neurologically involved patient, provides the therapist with a powerful new treatment technique. In a group of stroke patients, shoulder subluxation was reduced significantly (p less than .05) at the completion of a six-week NMES program. Some of the problems, and possible solutions, unique to the development of electrical stimulation programs for the shoulder muscles are discussed.\r"

When the images were reevaluated with knowledge of the type and number of grafts in each patient, 56 of 64 grafts (88%) were detected. Forty-one of the 46 (89%) left grafts, 15 of the 18 (83%) right grafts, and five of the 11 (45%) internal mammary grafts were detected. Although resolution was not adequate to determine the presence of graft stenosis, this early experience indicates that patent CABGs can be seen with MR imaging.\r"

Restriction endonuclease profiling of plasmids has led to an understanding of how the transmission of specific resistance plasmids among many species can contribute to endemic antibiotic resistance. Finally, it is now possible to detect the spread of specific genes among a variety of plasmids. In the future, increased emphasis will be placed on methods for monitoring the spread of specific resistance mechanisms, and research topics will include the spread of specific genes, both on chromosomal and on extrachromosomal DNA; the spread of strains with mutations affecting outer membrane proteins; and changes in the expression of specific chromosomal beta-lactamases. Restriction endonuclease digestion of chromosomal DNA, profiling of outer membrane proteins, and monoclonal antibody subtyping will also be used increasingly to monitor the spread of specific strains.\r"

In this study HBcAg was shown to be similarly immunogenic in mice. When injected into athymic (nude) B10.BR and athymic BALB/c mice, HBcAg induced IgM and IgG class antibodies to HBc in spite of the absence of T cells in nude mice. In euthymic mice, HBcAg efficiently stimulated T-cell proliferation in vitro and helper T-cell function in vivo. The dual functions of HBcAg as a T-cell-independent and a T-cell-dependent antigen may explain its enhanced immunogenicity. Denaturation of HBcAg yields a nonparticulate antigen designated HBeAg; when HBeAg was used as the immunogen, antibody production required helper T-cell function. Although HBcAg and HBeAg are serologically distinct, they are structurally related, and in these experiments were highly cross-reactive at the T-cell level. These results suggest that the elevated levels of IgM antibodies to HBc and the enhanced immunogenicity of HBcAg during HBV infection in humans reflect the ability of HBcAg to directly activate B cells to produce antibodies to HBc in the presence or absence of HBcAg- or HBeAg-sensitized T cells.\r"

The force required to separate the F1-JY pair is 1.5 X 10(4) dynes per square centimeter. This junction avidity for F1-JY pairs is 6 to 13 times greater than that for F1-F1 and JY-JY pairs; the F1-JY conjugate requires a stronger separating force and is more easily rejoined than the homologous cell pairs. This study provides an estimate of the avidity of cytotoxic T cells for their target cells and insights into the biophysical correlates of the molecular complexes formed in the interaction of cytotoxic T cells and their targets during the cytotoxic process.\r"

The structure was determined, to 3 A resolution, by the ISIR (iterative single isomorphous replacement) method with a platinum isomorphous derivative. The complex has twofold symmetry. Each subunit of the endonuclease is organized into an alpha/beta domain consisting a five-stranded beta sheet, alpha helices, and an extension, called the \"arm,\" which wraps around the DNA. The large beta sheet consists of antiparallel and parallel motifs that form the foundations for the loops and alpha helices responsible for DNA strand scission and sequence-specific recognition, respectively. The DNA cleavage site is located in a cleft that binds the DNA backbone in the vicinity of the scissile bond. Sequence specificity is mediated by 12 hydrogen bonds originating from alpha helical recognition modules. Arg200 forms two hydrogen bonds with guanine while Glu144 and Arg145 form four hydrogen bonds to adjacent adenine residues. These interactions discriminate the Eco RI hexanucleotide GAATTC from all other hexanucleotides because any base substitution would require rupture of at least one of these hydrogen bonds.\r"

Because most patients with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs that block D2 dopamine receptors in the caudate nucleus, it has been suggested that this increase in the number of receptors is a result of adaptation to these drugs rather than a biochemical abnormality intrinsic to schizophrenia. With positron emission tomography (PET), the D2 dopamine receptor density in the caudate nucleus of living human beings was measured in normal volunteers and in two groups of patients with schizophrenia--one group that had never been treated with neuroleptics and another group that had been treated with these drugs. D2 dopamine receptor densities in the caudate nucleus were higher in both groups of patients than in the normal volunteers. Thus, schizophrenia itself is associated with an increase in brain D2 dopamine receptor density.\r"

Forty mothers of adolescent female patients participating in the electrical stimulation program of one of the authors (NK) were interviewed confidentially by an independent observer (SW). Patients whose compliance was rated good or total were thought to have acceptable compliance rates. Overall, 50% showed good or total compliance, 10% fair, 5% poor, and 35% failures. It appeared that the failures tended to exaggerate their symptoms and use \"skin irritation\" as an excuse to discontinue treatment. The longer patients used the LESS (scolitron) device, the more compliant they became (P less than 0.0). This is opposite to the findings about brace compliance. Confidence of the mother in the device showed a positive correlation (P less than 0.008) with compliance, and a mother's concern of how others would react to her child's scoliosis had a negative correlation (P less than 0.003). From the results of this study, overall compliance appears to be somewhat better for electrical stimulation programs than for bracing programs. However, the high failure rate was both disappointing and surprising.\r"

Pretransplant treatment of the graft to eliminate passenger cells is one such method. An alternative approach is short-term treatment of the recipients with cyclosporine (CsA). In this study, parathyroid glands from Lewis X Brown Norway rats were cultured for 1 week and treated with antiserum directed against class II major histocompatibility complex antigens. Treated glands were transplanted into hypocalcemic Wistar-Furth recipients that previously received 30 mg/kg of CsA once a day for 3 days before transplantation. At 280 days after transplantation, 67% of the recipients had functional parathyroid allografts. Control rats (no CsA; fresh, untreated glands) rejected these grafts within 28 days. Control rats given 3 days of CsA and transplanted with fresh, untreated glands had functional grafts for greater than 56 days (median survival, 80.5 days). Prolongation of allograft survival with short-term, preoperative CsA demonstrates the efficacy of immunosuppression given at the time of antigen presentation. This course of CsA is even more effective when the recipient receives a graft whose passenger cells are eliminated.\r"

Cell growth of thyrocytes from normal and adenomatous tissues increased more rapidly (p less than 0.01) after TSH (0.1 IU/ml) was added but was unaffected by cAMP (10(-4) mol/L). In these cells, TSH also enhanced DNA synthesis twofold to twelvefold (p less than 0.01). The adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibitor, 2',3' dideoxyadenosine (ddA), increased DNA synthesis 1.3 to 6 times at a concentration of 2 X 10(-4) mol, whereas the membrane/passable cAMP analogue, dibutyryl-cAMP, and the AC stimulator, forskolin, failed to show any effect on DNA synthesis up to a concentration of 10(-5) mol/L (p less than NS). When administered simultaneously, TSH (1/2 maximum) and ddA (20 mumol) had no cumulative effect on DNA synthesis (p = NS). TSH stimulation in cancerous thyroid tissue (n = 11) demonstrated a lack of TSH response in seven of 11 monolayer cultures with no apparent correlation to cancer differentiation, patient age, or sex. Thus TSH was demonstrated to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell growth of human thyrocytes in monolayer cultures independent of the AC system. However, the TSH effect on cell growth and DNA synthesis was unpredictable in thyrocytes from cancerous tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchoalveolar lavage is used to obtain cells and proteins from the lower respiratory tract for diagnosis and research. Uncertainity exists about which site in the lung is sampled by the lavage fluid and what effect different lavage volumes have on recovery of the constituents of lavage fluid. Dilution of alveolar lining fluid by lavage fluid is variable and results are usually expressed as protein ratios to surmount this problem. We have compared cell profiles and the concentrations of two proteinase inhibitors--the low molecular weight bronchial protease inhibitor antileucoprotease and alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, together with alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor function and its relationship to the cell profile in sequential bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients undergoing bronchoscopy. There was no difference in total or differential cell counts or albumin or alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor concentrations between the first and second halves of the lavage. Both the concentration of antileucoprotease and the ratio of antileucoprotease to albumin were, however, lower in the second half of the lavage (2p less than 0.01 and 2p less than 0.05 respectively). There was no difference in the function of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (assessed by inhibition of porcine pancreatic elastase--PPE) between aliquots (0.28 mole PPE inhibited/mol alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor; range 0-1.19 for the first half and 0.37 mol PPE inhibited/mol alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor; range 0.10-0.80 for the second half). About 60-70% of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor in each half of the lavage fluid was inactive as an inhibitor. The function of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor did not differ between bronchitic smokers and ex-smokers. Alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor function was not related to the number of total white cells, macrophages, or neutrophils in the lavage fluid. Contamination of lavage by red blood cells was found to alter the concentration of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor but not its function when aliquots with and without erythrocytes were compared. These results show that the only difference between the two halves of these lavage samples is in the amount of antileucoprotease present, suggesting that more proximal secretions are being harvested early in the lavage procedure. Much of the alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor present in the samples is functionally inactive, but this is not clearly related to any particular cell type or to smoking habits, and does not differ between different stages of the lavage procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Vertical and horizontal gradients of V, Q, and V/Q were examined at three levels in each lung in regions of 1.9 cm3 size. In normal subjects V and Q increased along the axis of gravity in all postures and at all levels in the lung except for V in the prone position. Smaller horizontal gradients were found with an increase in V and Q from caudal to cranial--again except in the prone posture, where the gradient was slightly reversed. Constraint to outward motion of the ventral chest and abdominal wall is the most likely explanation for the different behaviour in the prone posture. In chronic asthma the vertical gradients of V and V/Q were the reverse of normal, but the Q gradient was normal. Bronchodilator treatment did not affect the vertical or horizontal gradients significantly, but analysis of individual regions showed that, relatively, V/Q worsened in 42% of them; this was associated in two thirds with an increase in fractional Q. After inhalation of beta agonist local vasodilatation may influence V/Q ratios in some units more than bronchodilatation.\r"

CT scans were available for review in 64 cases in which focal airway disease was identified with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and in 38 patients in whom the airways appeared normal at bronchoscopy. CT was positive in 59 of 64 cases in which lesions were detected endoscopically. If the results are analyzed according to the extent of involvement of individual bronchi, CT successfully identified 88 (90%) of 98 lesions. CT correctly excluded disease in 35 (92%) of 38 cases that were subsequently verified to be normal by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In no case was the diagnosis of malignancy missed by CT. While extremely accurate in detecting focal lesions, CT was inaccurate in predicting whether a given abnormality was endobronchial, submucosal, or extrinsic (peribronchial). In three cases CT failed to detect submucosal extension into the left mainstream bronchus, which has important implications concerning the value of CT in staging bronchial malignancy. It is concluded that CT is helpful when bronchoscopy is contraindicated or refused. CT may also be used in selected cases when there is low clinical suspicion of endobronchial disease and as a complementary procedure to fiberoptic bronchoscopy for outlining the exact location of major mediastinal and hilar vessels, lymph nodes, and tumor in relation to adjacent airways.\r"

Radiation doses were determined for the brain, lens, pituitary gland, condylar marrow, and thyroid gland. Condylar marrow received doses of 64 and 52 mGy, respectively, for the GE 9800 and 8800 high-resolution scans; 21 and 17 mGy, respectively, for the dynamically sequenced scans; and 26 mGy for the GE 9800 direct sagittal sections. Tomoarthrography yielded 31 mGy and fluoroscopy 12 mGy. Other lower doses showed 5 mGy for polytomography, 3 mGy for ipsilateral joint linear tomography, 1.9 mGy for the GE 9800 slow ScoutView, 1.8 mGy for xeroradiography, 0.9 mGy for contralateral joint linear tomography, 0.3-0.4 mGy for transcranial plain films and pantomography, and 0.2 mGy for the GE 8800 ScoutView. The estimated error in this study was calculated to be +/- 15%. On a relative scale, the radiation doses from high-resolution CT and tomoarthrography are high, dynamic CT yields a medium dose, and all other tomographic and plain-film techniques yield low doses.\r"

Patients with the second and third types were much more likely to have distant metastases and to require hysterectomy for successful treatment. CT findings of tumor nodules in the parametrium or myometrium were confirmed in three of the four surgical specimens of the uterus available for correlation. Myometrial tumor nodules were seen as areas of focal enlargement or as irregular eccentric areas of hypodensity. In one patient, parametrial extension was seen as an enhancing mass adjacent to the uterus.

Estimating organ-absorbed doses associated with CT examinations of children is necessary to evaluate the relative risks of carcinogenesis associated with radiation exposure of a particular organ. The risks from a particular CT examination depends on the patient's age because the geometric configuration of the organs (e.g., marrow distribution) changes over time and will, therefore, affect the scatter dose to the organs.\r"

Seven patients (1%) required immediate surgery: four to repair renal pelvic lacerations, one to repair a ureteral avulsion, and two to control bleeding after nephrostomy-tube removal when embolization failed. Four patients required delayed surgery for ureteral or ureteropelvic junction strictures, which may have been caused by a tissue reaction to the stones rather than by the procedure itself.

Thirty-one ureteral strictures (in 30 patients) that were dilated during a 42-month period were reviewed to assess the results and to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from the procedure. Eighteen (58%) of 31 strictures were successfully dilated and remained patent for at least 6 months. Thirteen (42%) of 31 strictures resulted in failed patency either immediately (two patients) or within 3 months (seven patients), 6 months (three patients), or 21 months (one patient). Fourteen (64%) of 22 strictures less than 7 months of age were successfully dilated. All dilations for strictures more than 7 months of age failed. Four strictures were of unknown age. Nine (69%) of 13 strictures located in the proximal or midureter remained patent, and three (60%) of five dilations at a ureteroileal anastomosis were successful. Neither of two strictures at a ureterocolic anastomosis was treated successfully. We conclude that percutaneous balloon dilatation is an effective treatment of ureteral strictures in some patients, especially when the strictures are less than 7 months of age.\r"

After infusion, these stones became extremely friable, fragmented easily, and were atraumatically removed through the fresh liver tract. The average hospital stay for these patients was 7 days, with no complications. The ability of monooctanoin to soften some stones allows an earlier, more aggressive approach to stone removal through the transparenchymal tract without risk of soft-tissue laceration; use of the infusion significantly decreases the hospital stay.\r"

Proper placement of the percutaneous nephrostomy tract through a posterior middle calyx and of a guidewire across the ureteropelvic junction is necessary in order to gain access to the narrowed area with a rigid cutting instrument. Except in patients with long lesions, high insertion of the ureter, or an enormously redundant renal pelvis, endopyelotomy gives excellent results with less morbidity and a shorter recovery time than open pyeloplasty.\r"

Because current techniques for measuring the amount of calcium in these nodules are unsatisfactory, a study was carried out to assess the capability of dual-energy digital chest radiography to identify and quantify the calcium content of simulated pulmonary nodules of known calcium content. Measurements were carried out on 280 nodules of various sizes and calcium content that were placed within the lungs of a frozen human-chest phantom. A new calcium quantification technique that uses a parallelogram was developed to eliminate the problem of nodule superimposition over ribs. Nodules containing more than 35 mg of calcium per square centimeter (i.e., 7, 30, 60, and 110 mg of calcium for spherical nodules 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 cm in diameter) were measured with a high degree of accuracy and reasonable precision. Dual-energy digital radiography is a simple and accurate method of measuring the calcium content of solitary pulmonary nodules in humans.\r"

  ".U": "87073048\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the MR imaging appearance of mobile CSF in the ventricular system in patients with ventriculomegaly caused by brain atrophy and extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus. Pulsatile CSF often has decreased intensity relative to less mobile areas of CSF, particularly on T2-weighted scans. At times, the flow-related signal dropout causes striking heterogeneity in the appearance of CSF. This has been termed the CSF flow-void sign (CFVS) and is most likely caused by spin-phase shifts and time-of-flight effects created as a result of CSF turbulence and increased velocity of CSF pulsatile flow. The effect is most pronounced in areas where a larger volume of CSF moves through a small channel or foramen, such as the aqueduct of Sylvius or foramen of Magendie. The scans of 40 patients with ventriculomegaly caused by brain atrophy or extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus were reviewed for the presence of the CFVS. All patients had the CFVS in the aqueduct of Sylvius on T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. The sign was present in the fourth ventricle in 96%, in the third ventricle in 70%, in the foramen of Magendie in 65-77%, and in the foramina of Monro in 33%. The sign was more pronounced in patients with larger ventricles but could not be used to differentiate patients with brain atrophy from those with extraventricular obstructive hydrocephalus.\r"

All lesions were detected by MR and CT with the exception of one small glomus tympanicum tumor that was seen only in retrospect with MR. CT better demonstrated subtle osseous changes of the skull base and the relation of the tumor to the middle ear structures. MR better demonstrated the relation of the tumor to the adjacent internal jugular vein and carotid artery. The paragangliomas had a characteristic MR appearance based on their vascularity. Serpiginous areas of signal void representing high vascular flow were interspersed among areas of high signal intensity caused by slowly flowing blood and tumor cells. This \"salt-and-pepper\" pattern was seen in all lesions greater than 2 cm in maximal dimension. MR was therefore able to accurately characterize the tumors as highly vascular. Multiplanar imaging and good tissue contrast and anatomic detail permitted display of the relations of these neoplasms to surrounding carotid sheath vessels and to intracranial structures better than did CT. In this experience, the MR appearance of paragangliomas was quite characteristic and differed markedly from meningiomas, neuromas, and metastatic disease of the skull base.\r"

Seven normal volunteers were examined, and the changes that occurred in the appearance of the CFVS were noted when data acquisition was modified by cardiac gating. Flow-void patterns within the internal cerebral veins and basilar artery were also examined. The results of this study confirm that CSF flow is related to cardiac systole and diastole. An increase in hypointensity is seen in the areas of the aqueduct of Sylvius and the foramen of Magendie during the time at which the systemic arterial pulse wave is transmitted into the brain. The physiology of this observation is related either to a direct hydraulic effect of the venous system on the CSF or to filling and expansion of the thin-walled cerebral venous system. Hypointensity or an increase in the width of the basilar artery and internal cerebral veins during systolic data acquisition was also noted. The mechanism of this phenomenon is related to propagation of the systemic arterial pulse wave.\r"

This article describes the radiographic and histologic features in nine cases of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, uncomplicated by infection, and reviews the radiographic descriptions of 22 similar cases from the literature. Pulmonary parenchymal disease in reported cases and in this series was usually diffuse. Three cases had localized disease. In one of these cases, the localized disease was segmental while in the other two cases, the disease involved a single entire lobe. Hilar adenopathy was noted in three of 22 cases in the literature and in three of nine cases in this series. Pleural effusion was noted in eight of 22 cases in the literature and in three of the nine cases in the current series. Histologic examination of the lung from patients whose radiographs showed predominantly nodular lesions revealed a prevalence of nodules composed of prominent spindle cells with atypical mitotic figures in the nuclei. However, patients having a linear pattern on radiographs showed predominantly thickened interstitium characterized by invasive angiomatous proliferation of irregular slitlike vessels with atypical endothelial cells. The results of this study indicate that in AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma of the lungs, uncomplicated by infection, two distinctive radiographic appearances of the lesions occur and that these two apparently different lesions can be explained by two types of histologic findings that correspond well with the radiographic features.\r"

Mass was measured on transverse images encompassing the left ventricle during both diastole and late systole. Partial-volume errors were minimized by measuring the length of the left ventricle on a sagittal image and weighting the mass of end slices accordingly. The range of postmortem left ventricular mass was 61-100 g. The linear relationship between postmortem left ventricular mass and mass measured via MR images correlated closely when MR imaging measurements were done at either end diastole (r = .94) or late systole (r = .94). The standard errors of the estimate were 13.7 and 14.7 g for images gated to end diastole and late systole, respectively. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility showed excellent agreement (r = .93 and r = .89 for end diastole and r = .99 and r = .93 for late systole, respectively). Thus, left ventricular mass can be quantified accurately and reproducibly over a wide range of masses by using ECG-gated MR imaging.\r"

Mammographic findings in recurrent malignancy included microcalcifications in six, microcalcifications associated with a mass in four, soft-tissue masses in three, and inflammatory changes in one.

With imagers operating at 0.35 and 1.5 T, T2-based tissue-contrast images were needed for the demonstration of the internal anatomy of the prostate gland. The display of zonal anatomy was improved when continuous 0.5-cm slices were used. Evaluating sequential sections, the peripheral, central, and transition zones could be differentiated. The peripheral zone showed higher signal intensity than either the central or transition zone and was discerned in the coronal, sagittal, and transverse planes. The central zone was of low signal intensity and was well displayed in the coronal and sagittal planes. The central zone was seen in 31 of the 32 young men (aged 25-35 years) but in only eight of the 23 older men (aged 40 years and older). The transition zone had intrinsic MR parameters similar to the central zone, and the two could be distinguished from each other only by the knowledge of their respective anatomic location. The low-intensity transition zone blended with the periurethral glands and the preprostatic sphincter. The transition zone was of homogeneous low signal intensity in young men but varied in size and signal intensity in older men. Such a detailed display of the prostate zonal anatomy offers a unique potential for the evaluation of prostatic physiology and disease.\r"

Heitzman and others have shown that certain interstitial diseases selectively involve these compartments. A model is proposed of the CT appearances in interstitial lung disease based on Weibel's divisions. To assess the validity of this model, the distribution of disease was studied in 44 patients with proven interstitial lung disease. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 2), and sarcoid in two of three patients typically involved the axial compartment. The middle (or parenchymal) compartment was abnormal in advanced stages of many interstitial diseases, particularly granulomatous diseases and drug toxicity (n = 2) in this series, but diffuse changes were seen early in extrinsic allergic alveolitis (n = 4). The peripheral compartment was predominantly affected in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 9), rheumatoid lung (n = 3), and scleroderma (n = 1). Prominent nodularity was a feature of lymphangitic carcinomatosis and of the granulomatous diseases, silicosis and sarcoid. The presence or absence of nodules coupled with CT demonstration of differential involvement of the three interstitial compartments is useful in limiting diagnostic possibilities in interstitial disease. By more accurately showing disease distribution, a more reasonable approach to lung biopsy options may be developed.\r"

This structure normally produces a single or bifid vertical line on the lateral radiograph.

These abnormalities were also present in 36 of the 46 patients with combined burst injuries.

CT studies showed these abnormalities to be the result of retropulsion of one or more bone fragments from the posterior margin of the vertebral body. Disruptive abnormalities of the posterior vertebral body line are reliable plain-film signs that a burst fracture has occurred and that compromise of the vertebral canal and subarachnoid space is present.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of exercise training on myocardial perfusion was assessed using initial and 1-year thallium-201 (Tl-201) exercise studies in 56 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Subjects had been randomized into a trained group participating in supervised exercise three times per week and a control group. Indices (non-dimensional units) based on computer-analyzed circumferential count profile from nine regions of the heart, assessed in three projections, were used to eliminate observer bias and more accurately quantitate Tl-201 distribution and 4-hour washout. There was serial improvement of the global distribution count profiles in 21 of 27 (77.8%) of the trained and in 9 of 29 (31.0%) of the control subjects (p less than 0.001). The mean interval change in global initial distribution over the year period was 5 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) in the trained and -6 +/- 14 in the control groups (p less than 0.003). The mean initial distribution of the trained group had improvement in all nine regions (significant in three), while the control group showed mean improvement in only one of nine regions. Additionally, the trained group showed improvement in the mean washout in five of nine regions (significant in three), while no mean regional washout improvement occurred in the control group. Thus, in this group of patients with stable CAD, exercise training resulted in apparently improved cardiac perfusion evidenced by enhance Tl-201 uptake and washout.\r"

  ".W": "The authors employed a large panel of monoclonal antibodies to characterize and quantitate lymphoid subpopulations within the paracortex, mantle, and germinal centers of frozen sections of lymph nodes from 18 patients with the persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) syndrome and five heterosexual controls. The authors' data indicate that Leu-3+ phenotypic T-helper cells (TH) are reduced within all three compartments, while T-cytotoxic-suppressor cells (Tcs) are increased. Using the antibody 9.3, which allows dissection of the Leu-2+ Tcs subset into 9.3+ cytotoxic cells (Tc) and 9.3- suppressor cells (Ts), the authors found that the Ts subset is increased in the lymph nodes of these patients. In contrast to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, paracortical total T-cells and Leu-8+ cells appear to be preserved in patients with PGL. Study of TH and Tcs subpopulations in peripheral blood in 12 of these patients revealed inverted ratios (mean, 0.59), which did not correlate with those seen in the lymph nodes. Although the paracortical TH/Tcs ratios were significantly reduced (mean, 1.44) they were not inverted, in contrast to some other reported series. In aggregate, these data suggest that, relative to AIDS, there is preservation of the paracortical T-cell microenvironment in PGL. Clinically, this correlates with more intact cell-mediated immunity and the absence of opportunistic infections and Kaposi's sarcoma in this patient group. Follicle lysis was present in 11 patients. Increased HLA-DR+ paracortical cells, aggregates of Leu-6+ dendritic cells, decreased TAC+ cells, increased OKT-10+ plasma cells, and increased interstitial immunoglobulin were among the other features observed in these patients.\r"

An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) value, a temperature above 38.5 degrees C, and a high white blood cell count were independent predictors for the diagnosis of septic joint infection in patients with acute monoarthritis. The presence of either of the first two signs had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87% for septic arthritis. Sixty-seven percent of all patients with arthritis were cured within two weeks from the onset of joint symptoms. In patients whose disease duration exceeded two weeks, a low CRP value, the absence of fever, and an elevated IgG value were independent predictors for the diagnosis of juvenile arthritis. Antinuclear antibodies had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 25% for juvenile arthritis or other connective tissue diseases. We recommend that laboratory tests indicated for all children with joint symptoms include determinations of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the CRP value, both total and differential leukocyte counts, urinalysis, and a bacterial culture of a throat smear. When arthritis is prolonged or when enteroarthritis is suspected, tests for antinuclear antibodies and serum immunoglobulins, serologic tests for Yersinia and Salmonella, and stool bacterial cultures should be included.\r"

  ".W": "A review of a large secondary and tertiary care hospital's experience with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) over 7 yr revealed that in most cases this complication emerges after the patient is admitted to the hospital. Compared with a hospitalized control group, SBP patients were more likely to have gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure and to require invasive procedures or therapies. Thus, hospitalized cirrhotics with ascites who develop SBP are more debilitated before development of SBP. The clinical signs and symptoms of this disorder are diverse; simple tests of ascitic fluid properties (white blood cell count, polymorphonuclear cell count, and lactate dehydrogenase) correlate closely with positive cultures, affording the clinician a chance to make an early presumptive diagnosis. Recognition of nosocomial SBP has important implications for the management of hospitalized cirrhotic patients. Further study is needed to determine if invasive procedures actually cause some cases of SBP or if the apparent association is simply due to identification of a sicker, more debilitated group of patients.\r"

However, retrospective case studies at four Norwegian hospitals showed that the majority of these cases were actually associated with the use of aspirin. The remainder of the cases were divided evenly among the four other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including piroxicam, then available in Norway. To further investigate the relationship between piroxicam and gastrointestinal bleeding, a 14-month prospective case study was undertaken of all patients hospitalized in Tromso, Norway, for hematemesis, melena, or perforation. Of the 43 patients admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding during the study period, 21 had used only aspirin or aspirin-like drugs. Of the 22 patients who had taken the other four NSAIDs the following were true: the cases of gastrointestinal adverse effects were equally distributed among all the NSAIDs; a significant number of patients had taken aspirin or steroids concomitantly with the NSAIDs; and a large number of the patients had previously documented ulcers or serious dyspeptic symptoms. On the basis of this experience, it can be concluded that side effects are associated with the use of all NSAIDs and that the number associated with piroxicam is not significantly different from that associated with other NSAIDs.\r"

Myocardial injury is predominantly mediated by T lymphocytes recognizing normal myocyte antigens, making this an autoimmune disease. Nonetheless, the autoimmune response cannot be inhibited by cyclosporin A (CSA) treatment of the infected animals. Mortality in treated mice was increased 2-4 times, but neither virus-specific antibody or cytolytic T-lymphocyte responses were affected, and maximal virus concentrations in the hearts of CSA-treated and control animals were similar. Cardiac damage remains T-cell-mediated, because mice given both CSA and rabbit anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) failed to develop significant myocardial inflammation. CSA did suppress immunity in Balb/c mice to an allogeneic C57B1 lymphoma, EL4. Subcutaneous inoculation of mice with 2.5 X 10(6) ascites tumor cells resulted in 100% of the CSA-treated animals having tumors averaging 340 mg 10 days later, compared with less than 10% of control animals having tumors averaging only 30 mg. Humoral immunity to the tumor was absent in CSA-treated mice. Therefore, whether CSA induces immunosuppression depends upon the antigenic stimulus used.\r"

Forced expiratory volume in one second adjusted for smoking was significantly related to asthma, the presence of a common cold on the day of examination among those with a history of wheezing, and the percentage of eosinophils. The association between FEV and eosinophils was restricted to never smokers. Among never smokers without a history of asthma, eczema, wheezing, or a common cold on the day of examination, eosinophil percentages and counts were significantly associated with the level of FEV; eosinophil percentages explained 4.4% of the variance of FEV. These results suggest that eosinophilia might be a risk factor for chronic air-flow limitation among adult nonsmokers.\r"

The premature may be at particular risk due to low levels of antiproteases, such as alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI), and antioxidants, such as ceruloplasmin (CER). Both alpha 1PI and CER deficiencies have been correlated with the severity of RDS. We studied serial alpha 1PI activity as measured by trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC) and CER in the serum 27 prematures who required ventilator therapy for RDS. Serum TIC values for day 1 were significantly lower (0.34 vs. 0.92 mg inhibited/ml of sample) in the 13 patients who developed BPD compared to the 14 who did not. No significant differences were seen on succeeding days. No significant differences in CER were seen, although both groups had levels 33-50% of adult normals (11.3 vs 9.3 mg/dl). Other significant variables included birthweight (p less than 0.005), severity of RDS (p less than 0.03), and gestational age (p less than 0.03). One way analysis of variances demonstrated day 1 TIC to be the most significant variable (p less than 0.0001), followed by weight (p less than 0.007), severity RDS (p less than 0.04), and gestational age (p less than 0.03). CER levels were not a significant variable. A formula utilizing unstandardized canonical discriminant function including day 1 TIC, birthweight, severity of RDS, and gestational age was 100% sensitive and 85% specific in the prediction of BPD for the original study group. In an additional 25 consecutive admissions with severe RDS of whom 18 survived, the formula was 100% sensitive (6/6) and 75% specific (9/12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 35-yr-old infertile man with chronic sinobronchial disease and dextrocardia (Kartagener's syndrome) was found to have immotile sperm and motile nasal cilia in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency in vitro was normal, but in vivo nasal mucociliary clearance was markedly prolonged. Quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated a severe reduction in spermatozoal outer and inner dynein arms compared with normal (p less than 0.001) but normal numbers of outer doublets, central microtubules, and radial spokes were seen. In 2 samples of nasal cilia collected 14 months apart, the number of inner dynein arms was significantly reduced from normal (p less than 0.001), but normal numbers of radial spokes and microtubule structures were seen. Ciliary outer dynein arms were slightly reduced in 1 specimen (p less than 0.001) but were normal in the other. It is suggested that the reduction in the number of ciliary inner dynein arms does not affect ciliary motility in vitro but that, under the increased load of mucus in vivo, this defect prevents the cilia from functioning normally. The difference in axonemal ultrastructure between cilia and spermatozoa from the same patient further suggests a separate genetic control of their structural components.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-lactamases from the 3 biovariants of M. fortuitum were compared on the basis of substrate profiles, susceptibility to enzyme inhibitors, and inducibility in the presence of selected beta-lactams. Despite differences in the distribution of beta-lactamase bands observed when enzymes from different isolates were subjected to isoelectric focusing, substrate profiles for the 3 biovariants were similar. All demonstrated a comparable broad spectrum hydrolytic activity for both cephalosporins and penicillins. The MIC for amoxicillin were reduced 4- to 16-fold when combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, but not to a clinically susceptible range. The degree of reduction in MIC for amoxicillin correlated well with the susceptibility of enzyme to inhibition by clavulanic acid as determined in an in vitro assay. Although all M. fortuitum strains produce beta-lactamase under routine growth conditions, 90% of strains demonstrated an increase in the amount of this enzyme when cultured in the presence of selected beta-lactams as potential inducers. Quantitative assays and isoelectric focusing further indicated that this apparent induction of beta-lactamase is a simple enhancement of the same enzyme(s) produced in the absence of a known inducer. This is the first demonstration of any inducibility among mycobacterial beta-lactamases and suggests that synthesis of these enzymes in M. fortuitum is under some form of regulatory control. These results indicate that the beta-lactamases have a role in resistance of M. fortuitum to the beta-lactams. Other factors, such as permeability and penicillin-binding proteins, were not evaluated.\r"

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study 19 patients with unilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease (greater than 66% diameter reduction) and no evidence of cerebral infarction. According to PET measurements in the cerebral hemisphere distal to the lesion, 7 patients had normal cerebral hemodynamics, 8 had reduced perfusion pressure with normal blood flow, and 4 had reduced blood flow. Neither the percent stenosis nor the residual lumen diameter in the carotid artery was a reliable indicator of the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation. However, a significant relationship was found between the PET measurements of cerebral hemodynamics and the arteriographic circulation pattern (p = 0.006). The role of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease cannot be determined from the severity of carotid artery disease alone.\r"

In previous studies, no convincing structural damage to nerve cells outside the substantia nigra could be demonstrated in subhuman primates. Using a protracted MPTP regimen and older animals, we now report locus ceruleus lesions and eosinophilic inclusion bodies in squirrel monkeys. The inclusions were seen only in areas where Lewy bodies are found in human Parkinson's disease. No such abnormalities were seen in control animals. These findings suggest that similarities between the neuropathology of MPTP-induced parkinsonism in the monkey and human Parkinson's disease are greater than first thought and increase the usefulness of the MPTP monkey model for research in Parkinson's disease.\r"

Management of 3 patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism required drug holidays during which there was a state of dopamine depletion followed by dopamine replacement. We used this opportunity to study the effect of the selective loss of pars compacta dopaminergic cells on vertical and horizontal saccade (fast) eye movements. During the drug holidays, visually guided saccades were hypometric and had long latencies but retained a normal saccade velocity-amplitude relationship. Dopamine agonists or precursors improved the accuracy and reaction times of saccades in all directions, but not their velocity. Two of the three patients also had intermittent blepharospasm during dopamine depletion. During the episodes of blepharospasm, saccade responses became slow eye movements. MPTP causes a dopaminergic-responsive disorder of saccade initiation that is similar to idiopathic parkinsonism. The inhibition of voluntary eyelid opening during MPTP-induced blepharospasm further increases this impairment of fast eye movements and altered saccade velocity, presumably via the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra.\r"

In cell cultures, replication of different strains of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 was inhibited at nontoxic drug concentrations. The concentrations giving 50% inhibition of plaque formation were, however, dependent on virus strain and cell type. In most cell types, the order of activity against HSV-1 strains was 3HM-HBG greater than (+/-)2HM-HBG greater than BCV greater than 2EN-HBG, whereas the drugs showed an approximately equivalent activity against HSV-2 strains in different cells. The cytotoxic effects of the drugs were also cell type dependent, the order of activity being BCV greater than 3HM-HBG = (+/-)2HM-HBG greater than 2EN-HBG. At growth-inhibitory concentrations, the guanosine analogs BCV, 3HM-HBG, and (+/-)2HM-HBG showed clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes, mainly because of the induction of chromatid breaks. When evaluated for their anti-HSV effects in systemic HSV-1 infections in mice, the order of activity was BCV = 3HM-HBG greater than (+/-)2HM-HBG greater than 2EN-HBG, and in mice infected systemically with HSV-2, only BCV and 3HM-HBG showed efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subgroups based on the number of previous cardiac procedures and the valve or valves replaced or repaired at reoperation (aortic valve, mitral valve, tricuspid valve, or multiple valves and mortality [deaths/number of procedures (% mortality)]) for those subgroups are as follows: (Table: see text) Predictors of increased risk for a first aortic valve reoperation were advanced age (p = .0002), endocarditis (p = .0018), female sex (p = .014), impaired left ventricular function (p = .039), and number of coronary vessels obstructed by 70% or more (p = .055). For a first mitral valve reoperation, the predictors were advanced age (p less than .0001), preoperative shock or cardiac arrest (p = .01), previous aortic or tricuspid valve operations (p = .02), type of mitral valve procedure (risk for repair of periprosthetic leak was greater than mitral valve replacement which was greater than mitral valve-conserving operation [p = .05]), and impaired left ventricular function (p = .059). For a first multiple valve reoperation, the predictors were diabetes (p = .04) and ascites (p = .02), whereas patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve operations were at decreased risk (p = .01). Comparison of second reoperations with first reoperations indicates risk increases for multiple operations (p = .01) but not for aortic or mitral valve procedures. Rereplacement of a prosthesis (p = .007), coronary bypass grafting at reoperation (p = .006), and advanced age (p = .06) increased the risk for second reoperations. Age is the most consistent predictor of risk for patients undergoing valve reoperations.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 96 septuagenarians (mean age, 74) and 24 octogenarians (mean age, 83) underwent coronary artery bypass (CAB) and valve operations using hypothermia and hyperkalemic cardioplegia in a 45-month period; there was a mean of 2.6 grafts per patient. Most patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV (57% of the septuagenarians and 88% of the octogenarians) preoperatively. The early deaths were 19% for septuagenarians and 37% for octogenarians; late deaths were 9% and 6%, respectively, after a mean of 25 months. Of 92 survivors, 78% of the septuagenarians and 87% of the octogenarians improved by one or more NYHA class postoperatively. Of 58 patients with combined CAB and aortic valve replacement, 12 (21%) died; of 38 with combined CAB and mitral valve replacement 19 (50%) died; 2 of 9 (22%) with combined CAB and double valve replacement died; and 2 of 11 (18%) with CAB and MV repair died. In comparison, of patients with isolated valve replacement in the same period, 2 of 30 (7%) in the AVR group died, 5 of 17 (29%) died in the MVR group, 2 of 7 (33%) in the DVR group died. The risk of combined valve procedures and bypass surgery was significantly increased in the elderly and may warrant a less aggressive procedure, especially in the mitral position.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac disease continues to be a major cause of death in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. The results of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe coronary artery disease in long-term hemodialysis patients have been studied in a group of 12 patients who underwent CABG between January 1979 and December 1983. Hospital mortality was 8% (1 of 12 patients). This patient died of ventricular arrhythmia. Two late deaths occurred, 1 from peritonitis in a patient undergoing long-term peritoneal hemodialysis and 1 from metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The two postoperative complications (morbidity 17%) consisted of a sternal dehiscence secondary to mediastinitis and a perioperative cerebrovascular accident. Ten of the 11 hospital survivors experienced complete relief from angina. In the other patient the angina became easier to control with medication. Combining this series of patients with those previously reported in the literature allows determination of actuarial survival in a group of 25 patients followed up for 1 to 79 months (mean, 33 months). Actuarial survival was 83% at one year, 69% at three years, and 48% at five years. This is not significantly different from the survival of long-term hemodialysis patients who have coronary disease but have not undergone CABG. It appears that CABG, when performed in long-term hemodialysis patients, is associated with an only slightly greater risk of mortality and morbidity than CABG performed in routine patients. Although CABG provides considerable symptomatic relief of angina, no statistically significant change in actuarial survival can be demonstrated.\r"

The group consisted of 833 (76.5%) men and 256 (23.5%) women. The women were older (mean age, 59.7 years vs. 55.4 years for men) (p = .0001), had more severe preoperative angina pectoris (mean New York Heart Association functional class 3.3 vs. 3.1) (p = .008), and had higher incidences of adult-onset diabetes mellitus (24% vs. 13.5%) (p = .0001) and preoperative congestive heart failure (8.2% vs. 3.7%) (p = .003). The overall mortality was 1.9% (21/1,089 patients); there were 10 deaths among the men (1.2%) and 11 deaths among the women (4.3%) (p = .001). Univariate and multivariate analysis of preoperative variables indicated that the female gender factor (p = .002), age of 70 years or older at operation (p less than .001), preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (p = .026), preoperative congestive heart failure (p less than .001), renal insufficiency (p = .036), peripheral occlusive disease (p = .002), extracranial occlusive disease (p = .001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.17) all had significant influences on hospital mortality. Perioperative myocardial infarction (p = .017), low cardiac output (p less than .001), and respiratory failure (p less than .001) significantly influenced outcome as well. Long-term (five-year) overall survival (90%) indicates a significantly superior overall survival among men (p = .0008). Event-free survival (absence of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina pectoris) was significantly superior among the men (p = .03) as well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total IL-2 dose ranged from 800 to 3800 X 10(3) U/kg. Side effects included fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major weight gain presumedly related to a capillary leak syndrome. Total weight gain ranged from 5.1 to 17.4 kg and was associated with the development of both peripheral edema and ascites. Marked eosinophilia was noted. Serum IL-2 levels were maintained at 10 to 35 U/mL for up to eight hours following intraperitoneal administration of IL-2. Increases from less than 10(4) cells/mL of a 2-L peritoneal wash to more than 10(6) cells/mL were noted in peritoneal exudate cell yields. Lysis of the natural killer target K562 increased from undetectable levels to as high as 125 lytic units per 10(6) cells. Proliferative capacity to IL-2 increased as much as 30-fold in peritoneal exudate cell yields. In addition, 70% to 80% of the mononuclear cells were T cells (Leu 4+) with intraperitoneal phenotype treatment. A single patient with pulmonary and hepatic metastases showed marked decrease in these lesions with intraperitoneal IL-2 treatment. The other patients treated intraperitoneally with IL-2 did not have significant (greater than 50%) reduction in tumor volume. These findings indicate that the intraperitoneal route of IL-2 administration may allow the in vivo development and expansion of lymphoid cells with antitumor activities.\r"

For tumors larger than 1 cm, only the triple regimen with IS IL-2 significantly inhibited tumor growth, whereas IL-2 alone or the triple regimen with IV IL-2 failed to retard tumor growth. Furthermore, the first regimen significantly decreased pulmonary metastases after primary tumor resection. The Lyt-2+ phenotype predominated in the effector population of animals treated with this regimen, while L3T4+ cells predominated in those treated with the triple regimen that included IV IL-2. Thus, continuous IS IL-2 administration potentiates the efficacy of antigen-specific chemoimmunotherapy.\r"

Relapses occurred with cessation of therapy, and repeated courses of therapy were required. One patient developed a rhegmatogenous detachment with retinal breaks in an atrophic area of treated retinitis.

Twenty patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with CMV retinopathy were treated with a new, experimental, antiviral drug, 9-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxymethyl]guanine (BW B759U), in dosages ranging from 5.0 to 14.0 mg/kg/d for a ten- to 20-day course. In 19 patients (95%), treatment halted the progression of infection and decreased retinal opacification, hemorrhage, and vasculitis. Vision remained stable in most cases. Six patients received no additional treatment. Fourteen patients received continued treatment with a lower maintenance dosage. Retinal disease reactivated in all patients who did not receive maintenance therapy immediately after initial treatment, indicating persistence of live virus despite drug therapy. Reactivation of disease also developed in four (40%) of ten patients receiving continuous, uninterrupted maintenance therapy for longer than three weeks. Reversible neutropenia, requiring cessation of treatment, developed in five (25%) of 20 patients on initial treatment and five (36%) of 14 patients receiving maintenance therapy. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment was a late complication in four patients. BW B759U appears to be useful in the management of CMV retinopathy by reducing or delaying visual loss.\r"

Antigens were present one day after corneal inoculation, but after inoculation of the snout, there was a delay of three days before antigens were seen. This delay and the distribution of antigens were evidence of zosteriform spread from the snout to the eye via the nervous system. Disease of the cornea varied in severity and timing depending on the site of inoculation.

Preoperative and serial postoperative titres of actin and myosin antibodies were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Perioperative cumulative release of serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase was calculated by approximation formulas that are used to estimate infarct size. Complete post-cardiac injury syndrome developed in eight (13%) patients and an incomplete syndrome developed in 16 (26%). There was a significant correlation between frequency and intensity of the syndrome and the ratio of postoperative to preoperative titres of actin and myosin antibodies. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the cumulative release of lactate dehydrogenase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase and the number of coronary vessels that were grafted, but no correlation was found between the incidence of post-cardiac injury syndrome and the number of coronary bypasses grafted or between the cumulative enzyme release and the postoperative immunological response against the major contractile proteins, actin and myosin. The amount of enzymes released during coronary bypass surgery seems to be a good indicator of the extent of myocardial damage during operation but it does not determine either the incidence of post-cardiac injury syndrome or the postoperative immunological response against the main contractile proteins actin and myosin.\r"

We examined the mechanism of lithium's effect by developing an assay for the canine equivalent of GM-CSF (called GM-CSA). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated canine blood mononuclear cells produce GM-CSA in a dose-dependent manner; this GM-CSA stimulates more neutrophil-containing colonies than does endotoxin-treated dog serum. Production of GM-CSA by PHA-stimulated normal dog cells was not altered by lithium. However, cells from gray collies during their neutrophilic period increased their GM-CSA when lithium (2 mEq/L) was added to low doses of PHA, whereas neutropenic gray collie cells did not. These data suggest that lithium could modulate cyclic hematopoiesis by increasing intramedullary GM-CSA at the time when marrow neutrophilic progenitor cells are at their nadir.\r"

  ".W": "Accessory cells and/or soluble factors, together with interleukin 2 (IL2), are required for the proliferation and differentiation of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T lymphocytes. Human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I), a human retrovirus isolated from patients with adult T cell leukemia, can transform T cells in vitro. We investigated the role of HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines as accessory cells in promoting the growth of T colony-forming cells. We found that T cells isolated by E rosetting and then activated with PHA, when seeded with as few as 5 X 10(3) irradiated HTLV-I-producing cells, could generate colonies in the absence of IL2. We analyzed further the effects of HTLV-I virions on T colony formation. Infection of T cells with semipurified HTLV-I viral particles promoted colony formation, in the absence of IL2, of accessory cells or soluble factors. The same results were obtained either with monocyte-depleted T lymphocytes, or with T4 or T8 lymphocytes. Furthermore, T lymphocytes in the presence of heat-inactivated HTLV-I (devoid of replicative potential) could form colonies independently of IL2. Finally, experiments with sera positive for HTLV-I antibodies (to abolish binding of viral particles to cellular receptors) indicated that HTLV-I promoted IL2-independent colony formation, only by \"touching\" T colony-forming cells. These results taken together demonstrate that the loss of the exogenous IL2 (and other growth-helping factors) requirement defines an early event of HTLV-I infection. The results also suggest that viral attachment to T cells possibly supplies an accessory function triggering autocrine secretion of IL2 by these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Blast cell chromosomal rearrangements involving the long arm of chromosome 7 were identified in eight of 197 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Breakpoints were variable but tended to cluster in either the proximal or the terminal 7q region, depending on the immunophenotype of the cells. The 7q32-q36 region, the locus of the T cell receptor beta-chain gene, was the site of breakpoints in four of 31 cases of T cell ALL but was not involved in any of the 166 cases originating from B cell precursors (P less than .0004). In three of the four T cell cases it was possible to identify the chromosomal segment that had been translocated to the 7q32-q36 region: 1p32, 2p21, and 6p21. The 1p32 and 6p21 bands are particularly interesting, as they contain the sites of two known protooncogenes, c-L-myc and hpim, respectively. Our findings suggest that the locus of the beta-chain gene of the T cell receptor is a preferential site for certain chromosomal rearrangements in leukemic T lymphoblasts, analogous to the T cell receptor alpha-chain gene on human chromosome 14. Translocation of proto-oncogenes to a site near the beta-chain regulatory sequences provides a potential mechanism for oncogene activation.\r"

Megakaryocytes were aggregated by both ristocetin and bovine plasma with the proportion aggregated being related to the concentration of ristocetin or bovine plasma. Maximal aggregation (greater than 90% of megakaryocytes) was achieved with 2.0 mg/mL ristocetin or 5% bovine plasma and required five minutes. All maturation stages of morphologically recognizable megakaryocytes were aggregated. The megakaryocyte aggregates were separated from the marrow suspension by sedimentation at 1 g and the megakaryocytes disaggregated by dilution with media (ristocetin aggregated) or addition of dextran sulfate (bovine plasma aggregated). Megakaryocyte purity and recovery were higher with bovine plasma than with ristocetin. A mean of 92% of the megakaryocytes in the bovine plasma aggregated cell suspensions were recovered with megakaryocytes constituting an average of 76% of the final cell suspensions. The viability as well as the diameters and DNA content distribution of these megakaryocytes were similar to those of the starting population. We conclude that guinea pig megakaryocytes behave like platelets in that they can be aggregated with ristocetin or bovine plasma and that megakaryocyte aggregation induced by ristocetin or bovine plasma provides a means to enrich these cells based on membrane rather than physical characteristics. This approach yields purified megakaryocyte populations that are representative of those in unfractionated marrow.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a T cell-derived lymphokine which induces hematopoietic precursor cells to proliferate in vitro and differentiate to neutrophils and macrophages. GM-CSF also inhibits the motility of mature neutrophils (NIF-T activity), and primes neutrophils to enhance oxidative metabolism in response to the bacterial chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-MLP). The present study was designed to determine whether this lymphokine also enhances neutrophil oxidative metabolism in response to the other major physiological chemoattractants which include complement-derived C5a, and the 5-lipoxygenation product of arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Superoxide anion production was measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome C reduction. Purified biosynthetic GM-CSF enhanced superoxide anion production by neutrophils in response to f-MLP, C5a desArg, and LTB4. In contrast to several other factors which prime neutrophils, GM-CSF did not prime for an enhanced oxidative response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). These results suggest that GM-CSF may be an endogenous regulator of neutrophil inflammatory responses induced by the major physiological chemoattractants.\r"

Mice were studied in the unperturbed steady state and after acute immunothrombocytopenia was induced by an injection of guinea pig antimouse platelet serum (APS). The state of thrombocytopoiesis was determined from platelet counts, megakaryocyte size, megakaryocyte number, and numbers of Meg-CFC. Splenic lymphocytes were evaluated by response to the mitogens bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and concanavalin A (Con A). Hematocrits, reticulocyte counts, leukocyte counts, marrow cellularity, GM-CFC, and BFU-E also were measured. Steady state thrombocytopoiesis was identical in nu/nu and nu/+ mice. In response to an injection of APS, acute thrombocytopenia was followed by macromegakaryocytosis and rebound thrombocytosis in mice of both genotypes. Splenic Meg-CFC increased in nude mice after APS or an injection of normal guinea pig serum (NGpS), and splenic GM-CFC increased after APS. Neither Meg-CFC nor GM-CFC increased in the spleens of nu/+ mice, but they showed early transient increases in bone marrow that did not occur in nu/nu mice. Sporadic, but weak, mitogenic responses to PHA or Con A were occasionally observed with nu/nu spleen cells, but these did not correlate with the state of thrombocytopoiesis. The results demonstrated that platelet production was normal in nu/nu mice and that megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production responded to the stimulus imposed by acute immunothrombocytopenia. Increases in megakaryocyte size and platelet production occurred independently of changes in numbers of Meg-CFC, GM-CFC, or BFU-E. A normal complement of T cells appears to be unnecessary for normal platelet production and its augmentation in response to the stimulus of acute immunothrombocytopenia in vivo.\r"

We have conducted a clinical trial in which some patients' tumors regressed after infusion of such antibodies. Here, we evaluated characteristics of the antibodies, the tumors, and the patients to determine which features best correlated with the clinical response. Neither the isotype of the murine antibodies, nor their avidity were predictive of clinical outcome. The specific epitope to which the antibodies bound was characterized by immunochemical techniques. Reactivity with a heavy-light chain combinatorial determinant correlated somewhat with clinical effect. Variations in the characteristics of the individual tumors such as antigen sites per cell and ability to modulate the surface immunoglobulin were not predictive of response. In one patient with prolymphocytic leukemia the anti-idiotype antibody had a direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells in vitro. This patient's tumor response was explainable by such a direct mechanism. In the other patients, who had lymphomas, therapeutic outcome correlated with the number of host nontumor cells infiltrating the tumor. The vast majority of these nontumor cells were mature T lymphocytes of the Leu 4, Leu 3 (T3, T4) phenotype. Thus, a preexistent host-tumor interaction seems to be important in the in vivo effect of anti-idiotype antibodies in B cell tumors.\r"

The requirements for optimal neutralization of PAI activity were investigated. The releasate of gel-filtered human platelets stimulated with thrombin served as a source of PAI. When 6 X 10(8) platelets/mL were incubated with thrombin (1 IU/mL), the releasate contained 18 to 26 ng/mL PAI as determined by incubation of the releasate with urokinase and measurement of residual urokinase activity on plasminogen (S2251). Preincubation of PAI with up to 4 micrograms/mL APC for two hours yielded less than 20% neutralization of PAI activity. In the presence of protein S, phospholipid, and Ca2+, neutralization of PAI activity was time-dependent with 50% neutralization occurring in two hours with 1 microgram/mL APC. The cofactor effects of protein S and phospholipid were concentration-dependent with half-maximal acceleration at approximately 3 micrograms/mL protein S and 10 micrograms/mL phospholipid when the experiments were performed at 1 microgram/mL APC. Diisopropylfluorophosphate-inactivated APC, gla-domainless APC, and thrombin-cleaved protein S had no effect on PAI activity, indicating requirement for preservation of the APC active site and of the Ca2+ binding ability of both APC and protein S. These results suggest coordinate binding of APC and protein S onto phospholipid membrane as a prerequisite for optimal expression of PAI neutralized by APC.\r"

A product of human peripheral blood monocytes, interleukin 1 (IL-1), was evaluated for its ability to stimulate fibroblast cultures to produce stimulators of human bone marrow BFU-E and CFU-GEMM colony formation. BFU-E and CFU-GEMM colony formation was evaluated using low-density, nonadherent low-density, and T lymphocyte-depleted nonadherent low-density human bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of a source of pure human erythropoietin. Both human monocyte conditioned medium (MCM) and human recombinant IL-1 (hrIL-1) induced fibroblasts to produce stimulators of BFU-E and CFU-GEMM in a dose-dependent fashion with maximal colony formation occurring when fibroblasts were stimulated by 25% MCM or 140 ng/mL ROO6B hrIL-1, or 1.25 to 5 ng/mL ROO6T hrIL-1. Preincubation of MCM and hrIL-1 with an antibody to IL-1 inactivated the ability of MCM and hrIL-1 to induce the release of erythroid and multipotential colony stimulating activity from fibroblasts. These results suggest that monocyte-derived IL-1 is involved in regulating the production of humoral stimulators of early human hematopoietic progenitors.\r"

Cells were surface labeled with 125I and proteins immunoprecipitated with specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). Two electrophoretically distinct bands were found in the HLA-DR beta chain region on both ALL cell lines in contrast to only one on each of the autologous B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the alpha chains were also observed with ALL and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from one individual. Preclearing of radiolabeled cell lysates with MoAb specific for HLA-DQ and -DP molecules demonstrated that the complexity of the HLA-DR pattern is not the result of antibody cross-reactivity with alpha and beta chains from other class II products. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that two beta chain bands are observed with each of the parental HLA-DR molecules on the ALL but not the B-lymphoblastoid cell line from an HLA-DR3,7-positive individual. We conclude that the HLA-DR molecules expressed on ALL and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from the same individual can differ chemically. Neuraminidase treatment reduced these electrophoretic differences, indicating that these molecules differ in their sialic acid content. Since small changes in class II molecules can profoundly alter cellular interactions, the functional significance of these differences requires further investigation.\r"

The only patient spared was free of neuropsychological deficit at the time of positron emission tomography. In 4 patients, the magnitude of ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism was significantly less at a follow-up PET study, when neuropsychological function had improved. When taken together, the 14 studies showed a significant tendency for the hypometabolism to improve with time after clinical onset. These data suggest that the ipsilateral cortical hypometabolism results from damage to the thalamocortical connections and reflect either loss of nonspecific activating afferences or a degenerative deafferentation-deafferentation process, or both. Its links with the concept of diaschisis are suggested by its tendency to recover. A causal relationship between cortical hypometabolism and neuropsychological deficit, however, although strongly suggested, cannot be firmly established from the present data.\r"

The sodium fluoride-sensitive isoenzyme was separated by isoelectric focusing on horizontal thin-layer polyacrylamide gels. The esterase isoenzyme was not detected in untreated or TPA-treated lymphoid, erythroid, or Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines, but was seen in leukemia cell lines of monocytic origin. TPA induced the new expression of this marker isoenzyme in two leukemia cell lines of promyelocytic and erythroid origin that are known to differentiate along the monocytic-macrophage cell lineage; TPA stimulation increased the staining intensity of the band in monocytoid cell lines. This esterase isoenzyme was found in 92% of the cases classified morphologically as acute myelomonocytic or monocytic leukemia, but only in 3% of the non-monocytic acute myeloid leukemias. All lymphoid or erythroid leukemias or lymphomas were negative. Treatment with TPA of AML and CML cells, which commonly differentiate to monocyte/macrophage-like cells, showed de novo the monocyte-specific isoenzyme. It is concluded that this isoenzyme is a characteristic marker for monocytic leukemia cells and will be a useful tool for the discriminatory identification of the monocytic element in normal and leukemic cells.\r"

All patients presented with progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, fever, anorexia, weight loss, and arterial hypoxemia. Chest roentgenograms exhibited bilateral diffuse reticular-nodular densities. The diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia was made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy or open lung biopsy. Two patients were treated with corticosteroids, with significant improvement. The third patient died of pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii six months after the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia was established. Serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were demonstrable in the two patients in whom the test was performed. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is probably another pulmonary manifestation of AIDS or AIDS-related complex. Although the clinical presentation may be identical to the more common opportunistic infections, the treatment differs, and the prognosis may be better.\r"

Cilia exhibited complete absence of only the inner dynein arms, while retaining outer arms, and mucociliary clearance was totally absent. We also studied neutrophil chemotaxis and other immunologic functions in our patient and found them to be normal. Our findings demonstrate an association between the structural abnormality of absent inner dynein arms alone and ciliary immotility in Kartagener's syndrome. The neutrophil migration abnormalities may have a different mechanism which needs further study.\r"

To investigate potential mechanisms to account for this association, we performed two-dimensional gel-electrophoretic analysis of HLA molecules from DR3/4 heterozygous patients. These studies demonstrated hybrid molecular dimers corresponding to products of HLA-DQ genes linked to DR3 and DR4, i.e., the DQw2 and DQw3 genes, respectively. Two types of DQ molecules were found: immunoprecipitation by DQw3-specific monoclonal antibody 17.15 identified a DQw3 beta-chain associating with a DQw3 alpha-chain and a DQw3 beta-chain associating with a DQw2 alpha-chain. The identity of alpha- and beta-chains comprising these hybrid molecules was confirmed by HPLC peptide-map analysis. Several characteristic peptide peaks identified both DQw2 and DQw3 alpha-chains associated with DQw3 beta-chains. The formation of such DQ alpha (DQw2)-Dq beta (DQw3) dimers potentially contributes a direct molecular mechanism for HLA-associated contributions to disease in DR3/DR4 heterozygotes.\r"

Symptoms of heartburn and dysphagia were significantly more frequent in the patients who had erosive esophagitis but often were present in those without this condition. Abnormal motility characterized by loss of peristalsis in the distal esophagus was present in all patients with erosive esophagitis, including the 5 who were asymptomatic. No patient with normal esophageal motility had erosive esophagitis at endoscopy. The patients with erosive esophagitis also had significantly diminished lower esophageal sphincter pressures and increased frequency and duration of gastroesophageal reflux episodes. Stricture was present in 13 of 32 patients with erosive esophagitis and was absent in the other 21 patients. The duration of disease, rate of gastric emptying, and fungal smear and culture were not significantly different in those with or without esophagitis. Treatment of fungal infection for a month had little beneficial effect. The pattern of esophageal motility in scleroderma identifies high and low risk groups for esophagitis and stricture, and can be used to select those who require further investigation, irrespective of symptoms.\r"

Total numbers of surface epithelial T-lymphocytes and subtypes were not found to be increased in coeliac disease, but there was an increase in density per unit length of epithelium. Distinctive changes in expression of Leu 1, Leu 2, and Leu 5 by the surface epithelial T-lymphocytes suggest that, although their total numbers are not increased, these cells are not passively crowded but have an active role, possibly as committed cytotoxic lymphocytes. Natural killer cells do not appear to be a major population in normal or coeliac small intestinal mucosa.\r"

The relative abundance of alpha 1-antitrypsin product from normal (0.989 +/- 0.197), cirrhotic (0.956 +/- 0.062) and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficient (0.818 +/- 0.12) livers was not significantly different. Although (RNA/DNA) was decreased in the PiZZ cirrhotic livers compared to normal (0.56 +/- 0.045 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.225), it equaled that found in the PiM cirrhotic livers (0.56 +/- 0.055). The concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA [relative abundance X (RNA/DNA)], while decreased in PiZZ compared to normal liver, is thus no different in PiZZ cirrhotics than in PiM cirrhotics. We confirmed this observation by quantitation of the alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA using an alpha 1-antitrypsin genomic probe. By RNA/DNA hybridization, alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA was equal in PiM cirrhotic and PiZZ cirrhotic (38.48 +/- 4.5 vs. 31.93 +/- 2.1), but significantly decreased from noncirrhotic PiM liver (58.36 +/- 12.7). We conclude that alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA is decreased in cirrhosis of any etiology, and this decrease appears to represent a general response of the liver to injury. Since the decreased alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA in PiM cirrhotics is associated with normal serum alpha 1-antitrypsin levels, it is unlikely that the decreased alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA in PiZZ cirrhotics accounts for their decreased serum levels.\r"

Infection of fibroblast cultures always resulted in an inapparent, persistent infection with production and release of infectious hepatitis A virus. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from the same patients at different times after onset of icterus and were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cytolytic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined by a microcytotoxicity assay using autologous 51Cr-labeled hepatitis A virus-infected and uninfected target cells. Cytotoxic peripheral blood lymphocytes capable of lysing autologous hepatitis A virus-infected skin fibroblasts were detected in all patients with hepatitis A but were not demonstrable in the controls without antibodies against hepatitis A virus. The clinical course of the hepatitis A virus infection was normal in five patients; and in these patients, cytolytic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes against hepatitis A virus-infected autologous targets peaked 2 to 3 weeks after onset of icterus. A clinically protracted form of the disease with persistent elevation of aminotransferases for at least 5 months after onset was present in two patients. In these cases, the highest cytolytic activity was demonstrated in peripheral blood lymphocytes collected 8 to 12 weeks after onset of icterus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CSF CRH levels were significantly elevated in hypercortisolemic underweight patients. Both CSF CRH levels and pituitary-adrenal function normalized after weight recovery. A significant positive correlation was found between CSF CRH levels and depression ratings in weight-corrected patients. We conclude that the hypercortisolism of anorexia nervosa reflects a defect at or above the hypothalamus which results in the hypersecretion of endogenous CRH. The positive correlation between CSF CRH and depression in the weight-restored patients is compatible with previous data indicating increased CRH secretion in the depressed phase of primary affective disorder and supports the notion of a relationship between CRH and depressive symptomatology. Moreover, these data are compatible with observations that depression is part of the anorexia nervosa syndrome.\r"

The amount of marrow fat was indirectly estimated by the difference (delta) between DE and SE VMD values. The rate of bone loss in the normal women was 1.14%/yr with SE and 1.03%/yr with DE QCT. Osteoporotic patients had a VMD decline of 1.62%/yr with SE and 1.17%/yr with DE QCT. Osteoporotic patients had significantly lower (P less than 0.0001) mean SE and DE VMD at any age, but VMD was not significantly different among groups characterized by different number of fractures or different radiographic severity of fractures. The threshold values of VMD below which the risk of having fractures was increased were 99.8 and 118.7 mg/cm3, respectively, for SE and DE QCT. Dispersion around the mean, overlap between osteoporotic and healthy women, and the incidence of asymptomatic osteoporosis were greater with DE than SE QCT. Osteoporotic women had higher delta values (P less than 0.05) compared to normal women, but delta did not correlate with clinical severity of osteoporosis. The results indicate that factors in addition to the amount of spinal trabecular bone determine the number and severity of fractures in osteoporotic women; DE QCT reduce the VMD underestimation due to intravertebral fat content, but not the overlap between osteoporotic and normal women; and further anatomical studies of osteoporotic vertebrae are necessary to investigate the effect of age on intravertebral fat.\r"

We suggested that maternal plasma immunoreactive CRH may be of placental origin. To further investigate this possibility, we measured plasma immunoreactive CRH in women during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and 1 and 2 h postpartum, and in nonpregnant women. Umbilical cord plasma and placental CRH concentrations were also measured. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the mean maternal plasma level was 5.9 +/- 1.0 pg (+/- SEM)/ml (n = 24), not significantly different from that in 10 nonpregnant women (5.8 +/- 0.8 pg/ml). Plasma CRH concentrations progressively increased during pregnancy (second trimester, 35.4 +/- 5.9 pg/ml (n = 39); early third trimester (28-34 weeks), 263 +/- 41 pg/ml (n = 14); late third trimester (35-40 weeks), 800 +/- 163 pg/ml (n = 20)]. There was a significant correlation between maternal plasma CRH levels and weeks of pregnancy. Plasma CRH concentrations were further elevated (2215 +/- 329 pg/ml; n = 9). During early labor, peaked at delivery (4409 +/- 591 pg/ml; n = 28), and declined rapidly after delivery [1 h postpartum, 1042 +/- (353 pg/ml (n = 13); 2 h postpartum, 346 +/- 91 pg/ml (n = 13)]. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.562; P less than 0.01) between matched maternal plasma and placental CRH concentrations. The mean umbilical cord plasma CRH level (50.6 +/- 6.1 pg/ml; n = 28) was much lower than that in the mother at the time of delivery. Umbilical venous plasma CRH levels were significantly greater than those in simultaneously obtained umbilical arterial plasma (70.8 +/- 11.3 and 41.8 +/- 4.9 pg/ml, respectively; n = 11). There was a significant correlation (r = 0.384; P less than 0.05) between maternal and fetal CRH concentrations. Gel filtration of plasma obtained from women during the third trimester, at delivery, and early postpartum and placental extracts revealed two major peaks of immunoreactive CRH: a high mol wt peak and one at the elution position of rat CRH. In contrast, only rat CRH-sized material was detected in plasma from nonpregnant women and umbilical cord plasma. Maternal plasma immunoreactive CRH-sized material stimulated ACTH release from anterior pituitary tissue in a dose-dependent manner and was equipotent with rat CRH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of endogenous arginine vasopressin (AVP) on ACTH secretion, normal subjects were given infusions of either hypertonic saline (HS) or isotonic saline (NS) combined with human corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or placebo. Basal plasma AVP was 2.3 +/- 0.3 (+/- SE) pg/ml, did not change with NS treatment, and rose to 5.4 +/- 0.6 pg/ml during HS infusion (P less than 0.01). Both basal and CRH-stimulated plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations increased during HS infusion. Peak plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were 11.4 +/- 1.5 pg/ml and 8.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl, respectively, during the HS (plus placebo) infusion. During the NS (plus placebo) infusion, plasma ACTH and cortisol gradually declined to 6.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml and 2.6 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl. The timing of the rise in ACTH during the HS infusion paralleled the rise in AVP. When an iv dose of 1 microgram/kg CRH was administered during the saline infusions, peak plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were 27.7 +/- 6.3 pg/ml and 17.5 +/- 1.0 micrograms/dl, respectively, during the HS infusion and 15.6 +/- 1.7 pg/ml and 13.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/dl during the NS infusion. When the areas under the hormone response curves were compared, CRH stimulated ACTH and cortisol secretion to a greater extent than did HS (P less than 0.05). The hormonal stimulation due to combined CRH and hypertonic saline was greater than that attributable to either factor alone (P less than 0.025), but was not different than the sum of the effects of the individual factors. These results indicate that increases in endogenous AVP produced by HS are associated with increases in both basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol release. The effect of HS appears to be additive to but not consistently synergistic with the effect of CRH.\r"

Expression of the GM-CSF gene was not detected in \"common\" (pre-B cell) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (11 cases tested) or chronic myeloid leukemia (4 cases tested).

  ".W": "Addition of fibrinogen to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture resulted in release of von Willebrand factor (vWf) from Weibel-Palade bodies that was temporally related to formation of fibrin in the medium. Whereas no release occurred before gelation, the formation of fibrin was associated with disappearance of Weibel-Palade bodies and development of extracellular patches of immunofluorescence typical of vWf release. Release also occurred within 10 min of exposure to preformed fibrin but did not occur after exposure to washed red cells, clot liquor, or structurally different fibrin prepared with reptilase. Metabolically labeled vWf was immunopurified from the medium after release by fibrin and shown to consist of highly processed protein lacking pro-vWf subunits. The contribution of residual thrombin to release stimulated by fibrin was minimized by preparing fibrin clots with nonstimulatory concentrations of thrombin and by inhibiting residual thrombin with hirudin or heating. We conclude that fibrin formed at sites of vessel injury may function as a physiologic secretagogue for endothelial cells causing rapid release of stored vWf.\r"

The amount of receptor in the nuclear fraction increased at the time of puberty and subsequently decreased in parallel with the decline in total receptor level.

Four of six suppressor T cell clones also profoundly inhibited EBV-induced immunoglobulin production, and five of five clones delayed the outgrowth of immortalized cells. These results indicate that during acute IM, suppressor T cells capable of inhibiting B cell activation in the absence of cytotoxicity can be identified, and may play a key role in the control of EBV infection.\r"

Multivariate analysis of risk factors selected emergency operation and patient age older than 70 years as the strongest predictors for operative death. Although patients having aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting had a higher operative mortality rate (13.5 versus 3.5%), the combined operation had no independent predictive effect on early or late results. At a mean follow-up time of 48 months after surgery, 72% of the survivors of operation were living, 10% were lost to follow-up and 18% were dead. Seventy-seven percent of long-term survivors were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. The incidence of thromboembolism, paravalvular leak, bacterial endocarditis and hemorrhage each occurred at a rate of less than 1% per patient-year. The factors associated with late death were preoperative age, male sex, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, cardiac index and functional class. Despite an increase in operative mortality, patients undergoing emergency operation were not at higher risk of late death. Operative mortality is concentrated among several high risk groups. For patients undergoing elective operation, operative mortality is low, especially if the patient is less than 70 years old. Late results are good for all groups of patients undergoing operation, including those who are at greater risk of dying at operation.\r"

  ".W": "In a 60 month period (January 1981 to December 1985), 82 patients (79% male with a mean age of 60 years) had 83 saphenous vein grafts and 5 internal mammary artery grafts with a total of 101 stenotic sites treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The mean time between bypass surgery and angioplasty was 51.2 months. The procedure was technically successful in 85% of patients, 86% of grafts and 85% of the sites attempted. In these cases, the mean diameter stenosis was reduced from 77 +/- 14 to 27 +/- 20% (p less than 0.001), the mean pressure gradient from 49 +/- 16 to 7 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery was necessary in one patient (1.2%) whereas myocardial infarction occurred in three patients (3.6%). There were no hospital deaths. Clinical follow-up was obtained in all 82 patients. Before angioplasty, 23% were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional class II, 60% in class III and 17% in class IV. With a mean clinical follow-up period of 21.4 +/- 2.3 months, 71% are in class I, 17% in class II and 12% in class III. There were two deaths, 3 months or more after angioplasty, one probably due to graft closure. So far, angiographic follow-up (at 7.9 +/- 2.1 months) has been available in 26 patients. Ten patients (with 10 grafts) exhibited graft restenosis; six of them have had second successful repeat angioplasty. Among the many variables analyzed, statistically significant predictors of success were a higher measured balloon/graft ratio (p less than 0.001), smaller diameter graft (p less than 0.001), and shorter lesion length (p less than 0.01). The only predictor of complication was diffuseness of disease in the graft (p less than 0.05). The statistically significant predictors of recurrence were the residual stenosis after the initial angioplasty (p less than 0.01) and the measured balloon/graft ratio (p less than 0.01). Angioplasty of coronary artery grafts appears to be a feasible and efficacious procedure with a low complication rate. The technique is a satisfactory alternative to repeat surgery in selected patients.\r"

  ".U": "87084755\r", 
  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody MEL-14 recognizes a lymphocyte surface structure (the MEL-14 antigen) involved in migration of lymphocytes into lymph nodes. Its use as a maturation marker for T cells within the thymus led to the view that a small population (1 to 2%) of MEL-14high thymocytes located in the inner cortex represented fully mature cells about to exit as thymus emigrants. The medulla, in this view, contained only the phenotypically mature but MEL-14low cells, and was not the source of thymus emigrants. The data we present, derived from flow-cytometric analysis of suspension-stained CBA mouse thymocytes, is not in accordance with this view. A high proportion (approximately 20%) of thymocytes express relatively high levels of MEL-14; these include some immature Ly-2- L3T4- and nonmature Ly-2+ L3T4+ thymocytes. Among the 12 to 14% thymocytes of mature phenotype (PNAlow or H-2Khigh or Ly-2+ L3T4- and Ly-2- L3T4+), more than half express relatively high levels of MEL-14. The mature phenotype and MEL-14moderate-to-high cells (8% of thymocytes) appear too numerous to account for the few percent MEL-14high cells seen in the cortex in frozen sections, and the mature phenotype but MEL-14low cells (2 to 3% of thymocytes) too few to fill the medulla; however, both together account numerically for the medullary population. By section staining, the medulla contains Ly-2- L3T4+ and Ly-2+ L3T4- cells in a characteristic 2:1 ratio; by suspension staining this ratio agrees with that of the total mature phenotype population, but not with that of the MEL-14low subset previously claimed to represent medullary cells. Another paradox is apparent when suspension staining and section staining are compared: suspension staining reveals that many mature phenotype cells coexpress high levels of both MEL-14 and H-2K, yet section staining reveals H-2Khigh cells in the medulla but not in the inner cortex, and reveals scattered MEL-14high cells throughout the cortex but not in the medulla. We suggest that section staining for MEL-14 fails to locate the mature cells that stain for MEL-14 in suspension; the few MEL-14high cells localized in both the inner and the outer cortex on section staining are predominantly immature Ly-2- L3T4- and nonmature Ly-2+ L3T4+ thymocytes; the majority of thymocytes of mature phenotype, whether MEL-14high or MEL-14low on suspension staining, are of medullary location; the medulla is the most likely immediate source of thymic emigrants.\r"

Two-color fluorescent staining with MEL-14 in various combinations with PNA and anti-Ly-2 and anti-L3T4 was used to separate thymocyte populations for functional analysis. A high cloning-efficiency limit-dilution culture system was used to determine the frequency of all cells responsive to concanavalin A (PTL-p) or of all precursors of lectin-enhanced cytolytic lymphocytes (CTL-p). As expected from earlier studies, PTL-p and CTL-p were concentrated in the PNA- thymocytes, PTL-p were in both the Ly-2- L3T4+ and the Ly-2+ L3T4- subpopulations, and CTL-p were predominantely in the Ly-2+ L3T4- subpopulation. Within the PNA- thymocytes, two distinct peaks of PTL-p were found in cells stained with MEL-14, corresponding to MEL-14- and MEL-14medium-to-high cells, whereas the CTL-p frequency increased in fractions showing increasing expression of the MEL-14-defined antigen. Within the Ly-2- L3T4+ subpopulation, two distinct peaks of PTL-p were found corresponding to groups of MEL-14- and MEL-14medium-to-high cells, with the intermediate fraction of MEL-14low cells displaying a very low PTL-p frequency. The Ly-2+ L3T4- subpopulation included fewer MEL-14- cells and more MEL-14high cells than the Ly-2- L3T4+ subpopulation. Within the Ly-2+ L3T4- subpopulation, the few MEL-14- cells expressed a relatively low but definite frequency of CTL-p and PTL-p. The more numerous MEL-14+, Ly-2+ L3T4- cells included a high frequency of CTL-p and PTL-p, which did not vary over the medium-to-high MEL-14 expression range. These results indicate that the correlation of MEL-14 expression with CTL-p frequency among thymocytes is largely a consequence of the relative frequency of Ly-2+ L3T4- cells in the separated fractions, rather than a direct link between MEL-14 expression and function. Nevertheless, MEL-14 does define significant heterogeneity in both the Ly-2+ L3T4- and the Ly-2- L3T4+ subpopulations. In particular, there is a reduced functional response among the small subgroup of Ly-2+ L3T4- MEL-14- cells, suggesting this population includes either immature cells or cells of a different functional type.\r"

  ".U": "87084759\r", 
  ".W": "The determinants encoded by the minor lymphocyte stimulating locus (Mls) are defined as determinants that induce strong T cell proliferative responses in primary mixed lymphocyte reactions. Although the Mls locus was originally described as having four alleles, a, b, c, and d, a number of recent observations have led several investigators to challenge the idea that Mls is truly a polymorphic system. To better define this system of determinants recognized at high frequency by T cells, the present studies were undertaken to evaluate the polymorphism of Mls products. In the present study, the in vitro proliferative responses of Mlsa- and Mlsc-specific T cell clones were employed to analyze Mls products. The identification of determinants recognized by Mlsa- and Mlsc-reactive clones was established by the pattern of responses to stimulators derived from congenic strains, recombinant inbred strains, and backcross mice. T cell clones and unprimed T cells gave concordant responses that confirmed the Mlsa or Mlsc specificity of the cloned populations. With the use of these two sets of Mls-specific T cell clones, the existence or absence of polymorphism of Mls-encoded gene products was examined. It was found that Mlsa-specific cloned T cells responded to Mlsa but not Mlsc stimulators, whereas Mlsc-specific clones responded to Mlsc but not Mlsa. This reciprocal pattern of specificity indicates that the Mls system as currently defined is therefore truly polymorphic. In addition, it was observed that both Mlsa- and Mlsc-specific clones were stimulated by Mlsd stimulators. In particular, the possibility that Mlsa and Mlsc are not alleles but products of different loci and that Mlsd strains are those that express both Mlsa and Mlsc is considered.\r"

Periodic analysis from 6 wk to 6 mo posttransplantation demonstrated that the T and B cells of these chimeras were derived from the MRL/lpr host. However, in the same A-Thy----MRL/lpr chimeras, erythrocyte repopulation was completely of A-Thy donor origin. In contrast, control MRL/+ (congenic mice that differ from MRL/lpr at the lpr locus and do not develop accelerated autoimmune disease) recipients were successfully repopulated in both the lymphoid and erythroid compartments by the A-Thy donor cells.\r"

Using cloned CTL, we demonstrate here that BLT esterase secretion into the supernatant is specifically triggered by antigen-bearing target cells and that this secretion is inhibited by soluble monoclonal antibodies against the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TcR). Immobilized anti-receptor antibodies induced efficient enzyme secretion in the absence of target cells, thus implying a direct involvement of TcR complex in triggering exocytosis of granules. These results support the role of the granule exocytosis in CTL functions and provide a quantitative and direct assay of a rapid CTL functional response to antigenic stimulation.\r"

Because the determination of IgG subclass distribution can be technically difficult, we used four different approaches to establish our finding. First, we used an IgG subclass-specific, antigen-specific \"sandwich assay.\" Second, we measured IgG subclasses of purified antibodies to Hib PS. Third, we showed that significant amounts of IgG anti-PS can be absorbed with a monoclonal anti-IgG1 affinity column. Fourth, we showed that IgG1 and IgG2 fractions of immune sera have clonally restricted anti-Hib PS antibodies that are easily distinguishable by their isoelectric points. The data indicate that both IgG1 and IgG2 contribute substantially to the IgG antibody response of most adults to immunization with Hib PS.\r"

Spleens from long-term survivors (greater than 6 mo) with no macroscopically visible tumor, when examined with anti-idiotypic antibody, showed a range of apparently dormant tumor with BCL1 cells present at 2 to 50% of total. A spectrum of protection against tumor resulted from immunization, and tumor emerging in the period 53 to 173 days postpassage was investigated for expression of idiotype. It was found that cells from individual mice expressed variable amounts of idiotypic IgM at the cell surface, although it was always detectable in the intracellular compartment. Unlike typical BCL1 cells, tumor cells developing in immune spleens often secreted little idiotypic IgM either in vitro or in vivo. This modulation of expression and secretion of idiotype was detected even in the apparent absence of serum anti-idiotypic antibody. On passage of spleen cells from the long-term survivors into naive animals, BCL1 tumor developed and killed the recipients in a way indistinguishable from routine tumor passage. These tumor cells, however, both expressed and secreted IgM of the same idiotype as the original tumor. It appears therefore that tumor development in immunized mice is suppressed by a process that includes modulation but not selection of the tumor cell idiotypic determinants. Analysis of possible mechanisms of suppression revealed the presence of cytotoxic anti-idiotypic antibody at variable levels in sera of immunized mice, and splenic T cells that proliferated specifically in response to idiotypic IgM. Only low levels of cytotoxic T cells were found. Passive transfer studies demonstrated a major role for antibody in protection against tumor, with no significant enhancement by immune lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The most challenging aspect of cancer treatment remains the management of invasive and metastatic tumor growth. Recent progress in the development and use of biologic response modifiers for immunomodulation has raised the possibility that the immune system can be used as an additional antitumor treatment modality in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy for the treatment of established tumors and their metastases. As a model for adoptive chemoimmunotherapy (ACIT) of renal cancer we have used a murine renal cancer (Renca) of spontaneous origin that mimics the tumor progression characteristically observed for human renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, we demonstrate that broadly cytotoxic lymphocytes, generated by in vitro culture with human recombinant interleukin 2, and used in conjunction with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride, are effective in treating invasive and metastatic renal cell cancer. Administration of ACIT i.v. or i.p., alone, or after nephrectomy of the tumor-bearing kidney, did not cure mice with stage II (locoregional invasive tumor) or stage III (lymph node metastases) disease. In contrast, nephrectomy followed by simultaneous bicompartmental i.v. and i.p. ACIT administration cured 80% of mice with either stage II or stage III Renca. These data demonstrate that simultaneous bicompartmental ACIT affords dramatically improved cure rates for advanced and metastatic Renca. This effect most likely results from efficient control of both locoregional and metastatic tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "Cultures of keratinocytes from uninvolved psoriatic skin have been shown to exhibit increased DNA synthesis. Since epidermal cell-derived thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF) can stimulate the proliferation of human keratinocytes in vitro, we have compared the formation of ETAF in cultured keratinocytes from normal and uninvolved psoriatic skin. Trypsinized epidermal cells were plated at nonconfluent concentrations in dishes coated with a collagen type I gel. Normal keratinocyte cultures spontaneously released ETAF into the supernatant from day 1, reaching a maximum level (mean 124 +/- 4 units/micrograms DNA) on day 7, just before the cultures became completely confluent (days 9-12). The ETAF release then gradually decreased until a plateau (mean 16 +/- 7 units/micrograms DNA) was reached on day 18. In normal keratinocyte cultures the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA changed in parallel with the ETAF release. Psoriatic keratinocytes had normal rates of ETAF release and of DNA synthesis until the time of culture confluency. However, when complete confluency was obtained, psoriatic keratinocytes continued to synthesize DNA at high levels (increased by 146% on day 15) while their ETAF release declined. Analysis of intracellular ETAF showed a significant correlation with the extracellular ETAF in cultures from both normal (r = 0.77, n = 10, p less than 0.02) and uninvolved psoriatic skin (r = 0.76, n = 12, p less than 0.01). These results indicate a relation between ETAF formation and DNA synthesis of normal keratinocyte cultures. However, factors other than ETAF appear to be responsible for the elevated DNA synthesis of confluent keratinocyte cultures from uninvolved psoriatic skin.\r"

All three MAbs--H1, H2, and H3--were of the IgG1 isotype and recognized the gB glycoprotein of HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). MAbs H2 and H3 not only bound to the surface membrane of HSV-infected cells but also neutralized both HSV-1 and HSV-2, whereas MAb H1 had neither activity. In mouse infection experiments, MAbs H2 and H3 showed a potent protective effect against HSV-1 infection, whereas MAB H1 was less protective. Furthermore, the development of zosteriform skin lesions in athymic nude mice was suppressed by administering MAb H2. These results suggest that human MAbs might provide passive immunization against HSV infections in humans.\r"

However, because of reproducibility problems with baseline variations of 25% in the same individual not uncommon, the global effect of the stimulation may be difficult to see. One approach to this problem is to perform the two studies sequentially. This means that, with the 110-min half-life of 18 F, one must take into account the residual activity from the first study when calculating metabolic rates for the second. We performed TEST-RETEST baseline studies on four subjects, with a 1-hr interval between injections. These studies were done without stimulation, in order to validate the repeatability of the method. To reduce the amount of residual activity from the first study, the first injection was only 2 mCi in three cases, and only 1 mCi in one case, out of a total injected dose of 5 mCi. A correction for residual activity was included in the RETEST calculation of metabolic rate. The results showed a global metabolic shift between the two studies of 2% to 9%. An error analysis shows that the shift could be further reduced if anatomically comparable scans are done at comparable postinjection times.\r"

The method uses frame-to-frame cross-correlation functions of the summed profiles in the vertical and horizontal directions of the planar images. The quantitative output derived from examination of the variation of the change in the pixel value, corresponding to the maximum of the cross-correlation function at each view, provides an effective and nonsubjective means of performing quality control on the presence and amount of movement during a single photon emission computed tomographic scan. In contrast to cine mode and sinogram display, easy to interpret hard copy can be generated through this procedure.\r"

The youngest began folinic acid therapy in addition to neurotransmitter precursors and a phenylalanine-restricted diet at age 2 months, and at 2 years of age has near normal development without evidence of neurologic impairment. His older brother began similar treatment at 5 1/2 months of age, when early neurologic findings were evident. At age 6 years his mental retardation and neurologic impairment are less severe than reported in most patients with DHPR deficiency. Little improvement occurred in their sister, who first received treatment at 2 years of age, when she already had severe neurologic impairment. An unrelated boy with profound neurologic impairment showed subtle signs of improvement after he began treatment with folinic acid alone at age 9 years. These results provide evidence that folinic acid is important in the treatment of DHPR deficiency and, if begun early in infancy, may prevent irreversible neurologic damage. The mechanism of folinic acid action in DHPR deficiency may be to increase indirectly the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported previously the characterization of the angiotensin (A) II myocardial receptor and provided biological evidence that the inotropic activities of the octapeptide AII are receptor mediated. In addition to the inotropic activities that this compound demonstrates, it also has potent vascular contractile activities. The decapeptide AI exhibits both cardiac (+)-inotropic and vascular contractile activities. The responses to AI are in large part secondary to conversion to smaller peptides, principally the octapeptide AII. To attempt to separate the inotropic and vascular response to these peptides, several decapeptide A analogs with amino acid substitutions in either the 1, 5 or 7 positions were studied. The compounds were as follows: [Sar1Ile5Ala7]AI; [Sar1Ile5 alpha-MeAla7]AI; [Sar1Val5N-MeAla7]AI and [Sar1Val5Sar7]AI. These analogs were studied in rabbit point-stimulated left atria, isometrically contracting aortic rings and competition for [125I]AII binding to myocardial ventricular membranes. All the peptides exhibited partial AII agonist activities in cardiac and vascular tissues with potencies equivalent to or less than AI. The inotropic and vascular contractile response to the decapeptides was decreased in the presence of the A converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The inotropic and vascular activities of these compounds in the presence of A converting enzyme inhibitor suggest that A converting enzyme may be responsible for the conversion to smaller peptides. Biologically active compounds were obtained with amino acid substitutions in the no. 1, 5 and 7 positions. Sarcosine substitution in position 1 did not enhance vascular potency as was observed with AII analogs.\r"

NAT activity was localized primarily in erythrocytes and was acetylator genotype dependent, as highest levels were expressed in homozygous rapid acetylator hamsters, intermediate levels in heterozygous acetylator hamsters and lowest levels in homozygous slow acetylator hamsters. Bio. 87.20 X Bio. 82.73/H F1 progeny expressed a unimodal nonoverlapping distribution of NAT activity intermediate between the RR and rr parentals. F2 generation progeny segregated into three modes (low, intermediate and high) of 21, 42 and 11, which is not significantly different from 1, 2 and 1. Bio. 82.73/H X F1 backcross progeny segregated into two modes (low and intermediate) of 18 and 16, whereas Bio. 87.20 X F1 backcross progeny segregated into two modes (intermediate and high) of 17 and 14, neither of which is significantly different from 1 and 1. These data are consistent with simple autosomal Mendelian inheritance of blood NAT activity by two codominant alleles at a single genetic locus. Partial purification of peripheral blood NAT activity by ion-exchange chromatography yielded separation of two isozymes that both exhibited acetylator genotype-dependent expression with highest activity in RR, intermediate activity in Rr and nondetectable activity in rr genotypes, respectively.\r"

The role of the immune response in the antitumor activity of intravesical BCG is not known. We investigated the requirement of a thymus-dependent immune response for the inhibition of the growth of the intravesically implanted mouse bladder tumor, MBT-2. Intravesical BCG had no antitumor activity when administered to athymic nude mice bearing MBT-2 tumors. In two experiments tumor outgrowth in control and BCG-treated mice was identical. Adoptive transfer of BCG sensitized splenocytes (one spleen equivalent per mouse injected intravenously immediately prior to the first BCG treatment) syngeneic to the MBT-2 tumor transferred delayed hypersensitivity reactivity to BCG antigens and restored the antitumor activity of intravesical BCG. In two separate experiments mice receiving splenocytes plus BCG had 0 and 20% tumor outgrowth compared with 100% in control mice (p less than .02 and p less than .05, respectively). These results demonstrate that the antitumor activity of intravesical BCG therapy requires a thymus-dependent immune response.\r"

Risk of AIDS was clearly predicted by the total number of circulating OKT4-positive lymphocytes (T4 count) at enrollment, while the corresponding T8 count was unrelated to subsequent AIDS development. Subjects in Manhattan had a higher risk of Kaposi's sarcoma than did subjects in Washington, DC, and the risk of AIDS tended to increase with numerous homosexual partners. Several of 40 potential cofactors defined ex post facto, including receptive fellatio, enemas, methaqualone use, and high levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, appeared to be associated with Kaposi's sarcoma but not with Pneumocystis pneumonia. Our data suggest that potent cofactors for Pneumocystis pneumonia were not prominent, pointing to the need for effective drug therapies, particularly to reduce the high AIDS risk of persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection and low T4 counts.\r"

Lymphocyte blastogenic responses to phytohemagglutinin rose from a stimulation index of 6.77 +/- 1.31 before treatment to 19.77 +/- 6.24 after four weeks of transfer factor therapy. Smaller but significant increases were also seen in blastogenic responses to antigens. Improvements in immune responses diminished after administration of transfer factor was halted. Thus, administration of transfer factor to patients with AIDS resulted in partial immune reconstitution. Further studies are indicated to examine the clinical efficacy of this immune response modifier in the treatment of AIDS.\r"

After passage of the conjugates through a Sepharose 4B column to remove molecular species with exposed binding sites on their B-chains, toxicity of the conjugates to different melanoma cell lines and nonmelanoma tumor lines was assessed by measuring their ability to inhibit cellular protein synthesis. The abrin conjugate was far more toxic to the target cells than the corresponding ricin conjugate. The 8 melanoma cell lines studied differed widely in their sensitivities to the abrin conjugate. The differences were associated with concomitant large differences in the sensitivities of the cells to the native toxins, and the significance of the level of the antigen expression became apparent only when the sensitivities of the different cell lines were normalized with respect to their sensitivity to native abrin. The observed relationship could not be accounted for by unspecific binding via the B-chain binding site of the immunotoxin. The differential sensitivity of the melanoma cell lines to the immunotoxin seems to be related to inherent differences between the cells in their ability to internalize and to process immunotoxins and toxins. The findings may have considerable practical implications.\r"

  ".W": "The splenic T-lymphocyte blastogenic and natural killer cell (NK) activities of C57BL/6 mice bearing cloned metastatic C3 or nonmetastatic C8 variants of the Lewis lung carcinoma were suppressed. The suppression was greater in mice bearing the metastatic C3 tumors than the nonmetastatic C8 tumors, although primary tumor sizes were similar. Macrophages were shown to cause this differential in immune responsiveness, while depletion of splenic macrophages by adherence restored the T-cell and NK responses. Also, splenic macrophages from C3 tumor bearers were more suppressive to normal spleen cell activities than were splenic macrophages from C8 tumor bearers. The suppression by the macrophages of C3 bearers was indomethacin sensitive and was associated with an increased secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Normal macrophages incubated with C3 culture supernatants were more suppressive to NK and T-cell activities and secreted more PGE2 than did macrophages incubated with the C8 supernatants or with medium. This finding suggested that the immune suppression in mice bearing C3 tumors was initiated by a soluble tumor factor(s) that stimulated the development of prostaglandin-dependent suppressor macrophages. An in vivo study examined if treating C3-bearing mice with indomethacin to prevent the prostaglandin-dependent macrophage suppressor activity would influence host survival. The survival time of C3-bearing mice treated with indomethacin was prolonged. These results suggest that the macrophage-mediated immune suppression induced by tumor cells may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis.\r"

  ".W": "Spleen cells from X5563 tumor-bearing syngeneic C3H/HeN mice were stimulated in vitro with trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified or unmodified X5563 tumor cells. TNP-reactive helper T-cells obtained from TNP-primed C3H/HeN mice were added to the above cultures in an attempt to augment the induction of anti-X5563 delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. The DTH responses were measured by adoptive transfer of cultured cells together with unmodified X5563 cells into footpads of syngeneic mice. Cultures of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice plus X5563 or TNP-modified X5563 cells failed to generate anti-X5563 DTH responses. In contrast, addition of TNP-helper T-cells to the cultures resulted in appreciable DTH as well as in cytotoxic responses to X5563 tumor cells. Demonstration of this immunity was dependent on the presence of TNP-X5563 tumor cells as stimulators during the culture period. The anti-X5563 DTH effector cells augmented by TNP helpers were found to be of the Lyt-1+2- phenotype and were tumor specific, since DTH responses were observed when the cultured cells were injected with X5563 but not when injected with another syngeneic tumor. These results demonstrate that TNP-helper T-cells are capable of augmenting the induction of tumor-specific Lyt-1+2- T-cell-mediated DTH responses from lymphoid cells of tumor-bearing mice upon the stimulation of TNP-reactive tumor cells. The results are discussed in relation to: a previously described tumor-specific immunotherapy model in which a growing tumor regressed by virtue of TNP helpers and the implications of augmenting induction of tumor-specific DTH responses in antitumor resistance.\r"

Daily injections of 0.1 mg naltrexone/kg, which invoked a receptor blockade for 6-8 hours/day, resulted in 31-92% delay in latency time prior to tumor expression and a 27-49% increase in mean survival time; the magnitude of antitumor response was governed by tumor burden. Inoculation of neuroblastoma (10(6)-2.5 X 10(4) cells) resulted in measurable tumors in 10-13 days and mean survival times of 30-34 days. Immunoreactive beta-endorphin was detected in tumor tissue (39.7 pg/mg protein). Receptor binding assays revealed specific saturable binding of ligands related to delta- and kappa-binding sites, but not for the mu-binding site. These results demonstrate that opioid antagonist modulation of neuro-oncogenesis is not dependent on the integrity of T-cell-mediated immunity and suggest the feasibility of utilizing the nude mouse model in exploring the role of endogenous opioids in human cancers.\r"

Most of the deoxyribonucleic acid-synthesizing cells were in the B cell fraction.

Immunoglobulin A-secreting cells were the most elevated fraction. The percentage of helper (OKT4) and suppressor (OKT8) cells in the postoperative samples was not significantly different from that in the preoperative samples. Only a few were Ia antigen positive cells. Co-culture of patients' B cells with their own T cells and with the T cells taken from two healthy controls revealed no signs of any helper or suppressor effect on these antibody-secreting cells. The results show that after cardiac operation the peripheral blood of patients contains an increased number of immunoglobulin secreting cells.

  ".W": "Ten patients having coronary artery bypass grafting were intraoperatively and postoperatively analyzed for endotoxins with the Limulus amoebocyte lysate test. A new highly sensitive rocket immunoelectrophoretic assay for reading the reactions of endotoxins with Limulus amoebocyte lysate was used. Preoperatively, all blood samples from the patients had negative Limulus amoebocyte lysate tests, negative blood cultures, normal total white cell counts, and were clinically without signs of infection. Intraoperatively, a substantial amount of endotoxins were found in samples from the extracorporeal circuit, the pulmonary artery, and the cardiac suction lines, which persisted during the cardiopulmonary bypass. The endotoxin content decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) 6 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass and further decreased within the seventh postoperative day (p less than 0.01). A positive Limulus amoebocyte lysate test was also found in some of the fluids administered during the operation, that is, the cardioplegic fluids, the priming fluids for the extracorporeal circuit, the blood transfusions, and the ice for local cooling. Postoperatively, all patients had rectal temperatures below 38.5 degrees C, but no correlation was found between the magnitude of endotoxin content and the degree of fever. Only one of the patients had positive blood cultures. Despite the measured endotoxin content, no intraoperative or postoperative complications were found.\r"

  ".W": "It is estimated that as many as 7% of patients who have an aorta-coronary bypass operation will require a second bypass procedure within 10 to 12 years. Using information from the Milwaukee Cardiovascular Data Registry, we matched 166 men who underwent two coronary bypass operations at least 6 months apart, between 1968 and 1981, with 428 patients who had a single procedure. Patients were matched according to date of operation and left ventricular wall motility function for analysis of risk factors for repeat operation. Elevated triglyceride levels were found to be the strongest risk factors associated with reoperation. In addition, both younger age and less complete revascularization during the first operation were significant predictive factors of repeat operation. The results suggest that efforts to reduce plasma triglyceride levels and ensure adequate revascularization may significantly reduce the need for repeat coronary bypass.\r"

After operation, the exercise cardiac index and stroke index were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II. The exercise stroke index increased significantly in Group I, but not in Group II. The variables affecting graft patency, examined by a stepwise method, included double product, cardiac index, stroke index, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during postoperative exercise conditions, and postoperative exercise training. The multiple coefficient for these five variables was 0.459 (p less than 0.01). Our findings suggest that physical exercise training should be started as early as possible after coronary artery bypass grafting to improve graft patency and recovery of cardiac function.\r"

The concentrations of acetate used were comparable to those encountered by blood monocytes on the surface of haemodialysis membranes.

Thirty patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were evaluated in a single-blind crossover fashion. Since the electrical stimulation is inaudible, each patient served as his or her own control. Patients received actual or placebo stimulation over a period of 2 weeks. They rated their tinnitus levels and the effectiveness of the device before and after using the Theraband. Only 2 subjects out of 30 (7%) obtained true positive results. Side effects were minimal and reversible.\r"

This paper presents preliminary experiences in more than 18 such operations monitored using this method. This preliminary study demonstrates a trend for a high (88.8%) correlation between BFER and postoperative facial nerve function. Identical latencies from simultaneous BFER and facial nerve recordings along with findings after facial nerve transection suggest that some portion of the complex BFER waveform derives from facial nerve depolarization.\r"

A significant increase of Cw7 occurred in 51% of patients compared to 21% of 627 matched controls (relative risk, 3.95). Trends towards increased frequencies of Cw4, B35 and reduced frequency of DR4 were also observed. These data suggest a possible immunogenetic predisposition to this otologic disorder.

In 15 of 25 patients with the simple virilizing form, 25 pregnancies resulted in 20 normal children, whereas only 1 of 15 women with the salt-losing form became pregnant; this pregnancy was electively terminated. Several factors seem to be responsible for the low fertility rates: noncompliance with therapy was probably high, as suggested by hirsutism and poor endocrine follow-up in 25 percent of patients; whereas 49 patients had regular menstrual periods, 14 had irregular periods, 10 had amenorrhea, 5 had undergone hysterectomy, and 2 had entered menopause; 87 percent of patients with salt loss and 50 percent of those with simple virilization (P less than 0.001) had remained single; the vaginal introitus was reported to be inadequate for intercourse by 35 percent of patients (53 percent of those with salt loss and 18 percent of those with simple virilization; P less than 0.002); and heterosexual activity was reported less frequently among patients with an inadequate introitus. The status of the introitus seemed to have a more important role in the sexual activity reported than did the degree of prenatal exposure to androgen (which was higher among patients with salt loss than among those with simple virilization). However, our data did not rule out an effect of androgen exposure on female fetuses. Our experience indicates that improved surgical correction of the external genitalia and better compliance with therapy will be necessary to improve fertility rates among women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the risk of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in neonates exposed to HSV at the time of vaginal delivery to mothers with a history of recurrent genital HSV infections. None of 34 infants exposed to HSV type 2 acquired an HSV infection. On the basis of this sample, the 95 percent confidence limit for the theoretical maximum infection rate is 8 percent. Cord blood or blood obtained during the first two weeks of life was available from 33 of the 34 exposed, uninfected neonates. All 33 of the samples possessed demonstrable neutralizing antibody to HSV type 2, and 79 percent had titers above 1:20. These results were compared with those in a previously studied group of neonates with HSV infections; the latter infants were significantly less likely at the onset of symptoms to have demonstrable neutralizing antibody to HSV type 2 (P = 0.000148) or to have titers above 1:20 (P less than 0.00001). We conclude that given the low attack rate, empirical antiviral therapy is not warranted in all infants of mothers with recurrent genital HSV infection who are exposed to the virus in the birth canal. Our findings suggest that the presence and titer of neutralizing antibody to HSV contribute to the low attack rate.\r"

The homoeobox-containing genes of Drosophila are control genes active both in the establishment of a segmentation pattern and in the specification of segment identity. In situ hybridization experiments confirm that these genes are expressed in a segmentally-restricted manner and that their expression presages morphological differentiation of segmental structures. Homoeobox genes have recently been isolated from the mouse and have been shown to be expressed during mouse development. Using in situ hybridization, we show here that expression of the mouse homoeobox gene Mo-10 (ref. 7) is spatially restricted in the developing embryo and that localization of expression is already evident within the germ layers before their morphological differentiation. These findings support the suggestion that the homoeobox genes of mammals, like those of Drosophila, may be important in pattern formation.\r"

Homoeobox sequences have been detected in the genome of species ranging from insects and anellids to vertebrates and homoeobox containing genes have been cloned from Xenopus, mouse and man. We recently isolated human homoeobox containing complementary DNA clones, that represent transcripts from four different human genes. One clone (HHO.c10) is selectively expressed in a 2.1 kilobase (kb) polyadenylated transcript in the spinal cord of human embryos and fetuses 5-10 weeks after fertilization. We report the characterization of a second cDNA clone, termed HHO.c13, that represents a new homoeobox gene. This clone encodes a protein of 255 amino-acid residues, which includes a pentapeptide, upstream of the homoeo domain, conserved in other Drosophila, Xenopus, murine and human homoeobox genes. By Northern analysis HHO.c13 detects multiple embryonic transcripts, which are differentially expressed in spinal cord, brain, backbone rudiments, limb buds and heart in 5-9-week-old human embryos and fetuses, in a striking organ- and stage-specific pattern. These observations suggest that in early mammalian development homoeobox genes may exert a wide spectrum of control functions in a variety of organs and body parts, in addition to the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell receptor is a cell surface heterodimer consisting of an alpha and a beta chain that binds foreign antigen in the context of a cell surface molecule encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), thus restricting the T-cell response to the surface of antigen presenting cells. The variable (V) domain of the receptor binds antigen and MHC molecules and is composed of distinct regions encoded by separate gene elements--variable (V alpha and V beta), diversity (D beta) and joining (J alpha and J beta)--rearranged and joined during T-cell differentiation to generate contiguous V alpha and V beta genes. T-helper cells, which facilitate T and B cell responses, bind antigen in the context of a class II MHC molecule. The helper T-cell response to cytochrome c in mice is a well-defined model for studying the T-cell response to restricted antigen and MHC determinants. Only mice expressing certain class II molecules can respond to this antigen (Ek alpha Ek beta, Ek alpha Eb beta, Ev alpha Ev beta and Ek alpha Es beta). Most T cells appear to recognize the C-terminal peptide of cytochrome c (residues 81-104 in pigeon cytochrome c). We have raised helper T cells to pigeon cytochrome c or its C-terminal peptide analogues in four different MHC congenic strains of mice encoding each of the four responding class II molecules. We have isolated and sequenced seven V alpha genes and six V beta genes and analysed seven additional helper T cells by Northern blot to compare the structure of the V alpha and V beta gene segments with their antigen and MHC specificities. We have added five examples taken from the literature. These data show that a single V alpha gene segment is responsible for a large part of the response of mice to cytochrome c but there is no simple correlation of MHC restriction with gene segment use.\r"

Alleles localized in this region can undergo reciprocal exchange during meiosis. Because such sequences do not show strict sex-linked inheritance, they have been termed pseudoautosomal. In man, several DNA sequences have been described which show pseudoautosomal transmission and which are localized in the pairing region at the ends of the short arms of both the X and Y chromosomes (refs 6-9, and D. Page, unpublished results). We now show that the transgenic mouse strain, Mov-15, contains a single Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) genome in its germline, and genetic evidence indicates that the provirus is integrated into the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosome. Proviral copies are lost or gained in 7% of male meioses in this strain, and mouse sequences flanking the provirus are tandemly repeated and highly variable. We conclude that unequal recombination events occur with high frequency in the pairing region, possibly because of the presence of repeated sequences.\r"

But preliminary hybridization experiments indicated that there are substantiated differences between the sequences of the two genomes. Furthermore, the proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have different sizes and their serological cross-reactivity is restricted to the major core protein, as the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-2 are not immunoprecipitated by HIV-1-positive sera.

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV (formerly T-cell lymphotropic virus type III, HTLV-III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, LAV) is the primary cause of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Patients with AIDS have profound immunosuppression as a result of almost complete absence of the OKT4+ cell population and are predisposed to a number of opportunistic infections as well as to certain malignant diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma and B-cell tumours. The majority of the opportunistic infections observed in AIDS patients are from the herpesvirus group and these are frequently the cause of death in AIDS patients. We have therefore investigated the effect of herpes virus infection on the expression of HIV and we provide evidence that herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-I) can reactivate transcription of latent HIV. In OKT4+ human T-cells HIV replicates to high virus titres, resulting in high level expression of viral RNA. This high level of expression has been attributed to virus-associated trans-acting factors that increase gene expression, directed by the HIV long terminal repeats (LTR), post-transcriptionally. In our studies we have tested whether transcription directed by the LTR of HIV is stimulated by HSV-I.\r"

  ".W": "Enhancers are cis-acting elements that activate transcription in higher eukaryotes independently of their position or orientation relative to the promoter that they activate. The mechanisms by which enhancers activate transcription are poorly understood, in part because, with the exception of the glucocorticoid receptor, the proteins that directly interact with enhancers have not been purified, nor have the genes encoding them been cloned. The upstream regulatory region (URR) that immediately precedes the early genes of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 genome (BPV) has enhancer activity when it is activated by a trans-acting gene product of the BPV E2 open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1). It is not known whether this enhancement represents a direct or indirect effect of E2 on the URR. We have used an E2 peptide expressed in bacteria and a DNA-protein complex immunoprecipitation assay to study E2-mediated enhancement of transcription by the URR. We show here that this peptide directly binds to four specific sites in the BPV URR, and to one site in the human papillomavirus (H)PV16 URR. All the binding sites contain a related sequence of nucleotides; a 23 base pair (bp) fragment containing this sequence can specifically prevent binding of the E2 protein to the BPV URR. The BPV E2-URR enhancer interaction may therefore represent a useful model system for studying the mechanism of transcriptional enhancement, as both an effector protein and its target enhancer can be purified and genetically manipulated.\r"

The initial clinical presentation was characterized by cough, rales, normal temperature, and diffuse obstructive airways disease by chest roentgenogram. Regardless of etiology, significant association occurred for cough and cytomegalovirus, apnea and Pneumocystis, and conjunctivitis and Chlamydia. Longitudinal follow-up demonstrates a mortality of 7/205 (3.4%). Morbidity was manifest as recurrent wheezing episodes in 86/187 (46%) patients, persistently abnormal chest roentgenographic findings for at least 12 months in 17/109 (15%) patients, and abnormal pulmonary functions in 15/25 (60%) patients. These abnormalities occurred irrespective of prematurity, atopy, or the initial etiologic agent associated with the pneumonitis. These data add further evidence that respiratory infections during infancy may well be predecessors of obstructive airways disease in later life.\r"

The 5' region contains one copy of a 26-base-pair (bp) exon (W0) [which is 28 bp downstream from a CAATT-(N)34TATAAA sequence (N, unspecified base)] and seven copies of two small exons (W1, 66 bp; W2, 132 bp). In addition, there are three exons from the \"unique\" region of the BamHI Y fragment of the viral genome. Two other cDNA clones that have been described, corresponding to latent viral transcripts, share homology in their 5' regions with this clone and are clearly divergent at their 3' ends. The cDNA clone described in this paper contains one long open reading frame that extends through the repeat element. In vitro transcription and translation of this open reading frame yielded a 62-kDa polypeptide that could be immunoprecipitated by an Epstein-Barr virus-positive human serum.\r"

LAP1 cells (TK- and AP-) were cotransformed with human genomic DNA and the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. TK+ transformants, first selected, were submitted to acid loading. The rare transformants that survived (frequency, 2-8 X 10(-7) expressed Na+/H+ antiport activity (AP+). We found that: transformation with mouse LAP1 DNA did not give rise to AP+ transformants; transformation of LAP1 cells with DNA from an altered Na+/H+ antiporter hamster variant led to AP+ transformants expressing the altered Na+/H+ antiporter of the DNA donor; human repeated sequences were present in all primary, secondary, and tertiary mouse AP+ transformants; six identical EcoRI human DNA fragments (55 kilobase pairs of the human genome) cosegregated with the Na+/H+ antiport activity in secondary and tertiary transformants. These results strongly suggest that we have stably expressed the structural gene for the human Na+/H+ antiporter in mouse cells.\r"

A sequence similar to the Goldberg-Hogness promoter (\"TATA\" box), TATTA, is located 32 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. Exons 2 and 4 of the glutathione S-transferase gene encode amino acid sequences of the Ya subunit that are highly conserved in the Yc subunit, whereas exons 3 and 5 encode amino acids that are divergent in the Yc subunit. These data suggest that exons 2 and 4 may encode domains of the Ya subunits that have similar structural or functional properties to the corresponding domains in the Yc subunit (e.g., glutathione binding site), whereas exons 3 and 5 may encode domains of the Ya subunit that have unique structural or functional properties to the corresponding domains in the Yc subunit (e.g., substrate binding site).\r"

The gene encoding this protein is present in two copies (21-OHase A and B) in the S region of the murine major histocompatibility complex. Previous studies utilizing gene-specific oligonucleotide probes and gene transfer showed that only the 21-OHase A gene is expressed in the BALB/c mouse. Here, we present the complete primary structures of both BALB/c 21-OHase encoding genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences defines a deletion of 215 nucleotides spanning the second exon of the 21-OHase B gene; other nucleotide changes in the 21-OHase B gene introduce frame shifts and premature termination codons. Southern blot analysis of C57BL/6 and DBA/2J mice indicates that a similar deletion is present in these strains; however the C3H/HeJ strain is a structural variant. A hybrid gene composed of the 21-OHase B promoter placed 5' of the 21-OHase A structural sequences was efficiently transcribed following transfection into Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells. These findings demonstrate that the 21-OHase B gene promoter is functional and suggest that mutations within the 21-OHase B structural gene are responsible for its lack of expression.\r"

As an initial step toward understanding the molecular details of how C1 controls pigment biosynthesis, we cloned the C1 gene. This was accomplished by first cloning a mutable allele of C1, c1-m5, which contains the transposable element Spm. A combination of molecular and genetic analysis was used to identify the Spm at the C1 locus. Individual genomic DNAs from a population in which the c1-mutable phenotype was segregating with the recessive c1 phenotype were digested with methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes and probed with a small DNA fragment derived from a defective Spm. One Sal I restriction fragment complementary to the Spm probe was shown to be present in the DNA of individuals with the c1-m5 phenotype but absent from DNA of individuals with a recessive c1 phenotype. Subsequent cloning and restriction analysis of this fragment revealed sequences flanking the Spm that proved to be C1-specific. A DNA fragment derived from the flanking sequences was then used as a probe to clone the wild-type C1 gene and several additional alleles of C1, including one stable recessive, two mutations caused by Ds insertions, one mutation induced by insertion of a defective Spm, and two dominant mutations, C1-S and C1-I. RNA blot hybridization analysis of three C1 alleles indicates that C1 regulation of the Bz1 and A1 structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway is at the transcriptional level.\r"

Hybrids that failed to survive in the absence of this molecule represented a major proportion of rat-mouse hybridomas but were very rare among mouse-mouse B-cell hybrids. Stable factor-dependent B-cell hybridomas were used to monitor the purification of the growth factor from the supernatant of a clonotypically stimulated mouse helper T-cell clone. Sequential fractionation using gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase HPLC resolved the factor from other B-cell growth factors and yielded a single-chain protein characterized by a major charge (pI = 5-7) and molecular mass (22- to 29-kDa) heterogeneity, probably due to variations in glycosylation. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein, which is active on B-cell hybridomas in the 0.1 pM range, showed no significant homology with that of known lymphokines. Because the purified factor also supported the growth and survival in vitro of murine plasmacytomas (to be published elsewhere), it was provisionally designated interleukin-HP1 (where H stands for hybridoma and P stands for plasmacytoma).\r"

There was a 10-fold increase in the frequency of precursors responding to HLA antigens when they were expressed on murine cells. It was determined that the increased frequency of responders was due to CTL that could only recognize HLA antigens on the syngeneic murine line to which they had been stimulated and that these CTL could not lyse any other HLA expressing murine cells of different H-2 haplotypes. The lytic activity of these CTL was inhibited by H-2b-specific antibodies. These results indicate that such CTL recognize HLA antigens in the context of the H-2 major histocompatibility complex. The magnitude and specificity of CTL responses to xenoantigens are discussed in the context of a model for T-cell interactions with major histocompatibility antigens.\r"

  ".W": "The murine T200 family of cell-surface glycoproteins is expressed on hematopoietic lineage cell types in a developmentally regulated manner with different lymphocyte subpopulations expressing cross-reactive but structurally distinct forms. To investigate the differences between these forms and the regulation of these differences, murine T200 cDNA clones were isolated by using a probe obtained by subtractive hybridization. This procedure made use of a T200+ L-cell transfectant and the parent Ltk- cell line. The 1.9-kilobase (kb) cDNA clone was sequenced and found to contain the coding region of the COOH-terminal 331 amino acids and 0.9 kb of 3' untranslated region. Where the sequence overlapped with the rat sequence, 80-90% homology was observed. RNA blot analysis revealed that B-lineage cell lines express either a 5.6-kb or a 6.5-kb mRNA correlating to the size difference of the T200 glycoprotein synthesized. Similarly, in the T-cell lineage a helper T-cell clone and a cytotoxic T-cell clone express T200 transcripts of 5.6 kb and 5.9 kb, respectively, which correlate with the distinct sizes of their T200 glycoproteins. A T200-negative mutant of a T-cell line was found to express full-length T200 mRNA, although at a diminished level.\r"

  ".W": "Maize chloroplast DNA sequences representing 94% of the chromosome have been surveyed for their activity as autonomously replicating sequences in yeast and as templates for DNA synthesis in vitro by a partially purified chloroplast DNA polymerase. A maize chloroplast DNA region extending over about 9 kilobase pairs is especially active as a template for the DNA synthesis reaction. Fragments from within this region are much more active than DNA from elsewhere in the chromosome and 50- to 100-fold more active than DNA of the cloning vector pBR322. The smallest of the strongly active subfragments that we have studied, the 1368-base-pair EcoRI fragment x, has been sequenced and found to contain the coding region of chloroplast ribosomal protein L16. EcoRI fragment x shows sequence homology with a portion of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast chromosome that forms a displacement loop [Wang, X.-M., Chang, C.H., Waddell, J. & Wu, M. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 3857-3872]. Maize chloroplast DNA fragments that permit autonomous replication of DNA in yeast are not active as templates for DNA synthesis in the in vitro assay. The template active region we have identified may represent one of the origins of replication of maize chloroplast DNA.\r"

These two clones differ, however, in the diversity and joining portions of the alpha and beta chains of their T-cell receptor molecules. The analysis of 3F9 and LB2 with monoclonal antibodies specific for the 3F9 T-cell receptor shows that these two T-cell clones share the same idiotype; however, 3F9 and LB2 do not exhibit any antigen and/or major histocompatibility complex cross-reactivity.

Within 175 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site, four protected regions (\"footprints\") were identified on the coding strand, at nucleotides -46 to -68 (I), -72 to -92 (II), -113 to -134 (III), and -136 to -175 (IV). Nuclear proteins (0.6 M NaCl fraction from a heparin-Sepharose column chromatography of nuclear extracts) of a variety of cell types produced footprints I, III, and IV and a fifth footprint (beyond nucleotide -200). In contrast, footprint II was produced only by T-cell extracts, although nuclear extracts of a transformed B-lymphoblastoid line produced a partial footprint in this region. Furthermore, footprint analysis of the noncoding strand showed that a continuous region of protection corresponding to the entire region of footprints I and II was generated, along with a DNase I-hypersensitive site, by nuclear proteins derived from T cells but not other cell types. Footprint I has the sequence structure of many well-defined protein-DNA binding sites. Nucleotide sequences in the region of footprint II bore no homology to known sequences, whereas those in the areas of footprints III and IV were similar to motifs within immunoglobulin and other enhancers. These findings may have implications for the tissue specificity of human Ti beta-chain gene transcription.\r"

Using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay, both the viable virus and the UV-inactivated feline leukemia virus, but not the CKS-17, activated B lymphocytes to secrete IgG. When staphylococcal protein A, a polyclonal B-cell activator, was used to stimulate IgG synthesis by feline lymphocytes, the viable virus, the UV-inactivated virus, and the CKS-17 peptide each strongly suppressed IgG secretion without compromising viability of the lymphocytes. These findings suggest that the immunosuppressive influences of feline leukemia virus on immunoglobulin synthesis may reside in a conserved portion of the envelope glycoprotein that includes the region homologous to CKS-17.\r"

  ".W": "A translocation between chromosomes 7 and 9, t(7;9), has been described in cell lines derived from the malignant cells of children with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma. Our cytogenetic analysis of one such cell line, SUP-T3, demonstrates that the breakpoints on chromosomes 7 and 9 lie within bands q36 and q34, respectively, corresponding to the location of the gene encoding the beta chain of the T-cell receptor, TCRB, and the gene homologous to the transforming gene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, ABL. We investigated the role of these genes in the t(7;9). In situ chromosomal hybridization of TCRB and ABL probes to metaphase cells from SUP-T3 demonstrated that ABL is translocated from chromosome 9 to 7 and that all or part of TCRB is translocated from chromosome 7 to 9. Southern blot analysis revealed that both TCRB alleles were rearranged; however, it could not be determined whether the translocation breakpoint lies within this gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis were used to examine more than 500 kilobases of the ABL locus; we concluded that there are no rearrangements within 250 kb in either direction of the sequences homologous to v-abl. Additionally, no abnormal ABL protein was detected in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. These results indicate that, in SUP-T3, the breakpoint on chromosome 9 lies proximal to ABL and that the break results in no apparent alteration of the ABL protein. We therefore hypothesize that another gene on chromosome 9, at band q34, plays a role in this translocation. This study also demonstrates that pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is a powerful new tool for the analysis of human chromosomal translocations.\r"

  ".U": "87092385\r", 
  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, is expressed as at least three polypeptide chain, (ld, sd, and ssd chains) specified by a single gene and derived by alternative splicing and polyadenylation-site selection during RNA processing. We describe here the characterization of seven overlapping genomic phage clones reactive with N-CAM cDNA, indicating that the chicken N-CAM gene is more than 50 kilobases long. Analysis of the gene shows that there are at least 19 exons and that the coding sequences for the ld, sd, and ssd chains are assembled from 18, 17, and 15 exons, respectively. The first 14 exons appear to be common to all three chains and encode the amino-terminal portion of N-CAM, which contains five tandem homologous repeats resembling those seen in the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. In contrast to other genes containing such domains, each of these segments in N-CAM is specified by two exons. The carboxyl-terminal portion of each N-CAM chain is different as a result of the alternative use of exons. A single exon encodes the carboxyl-terminal 26 amino acids of the ssd chain and the 3' untranslated region of its mRNA, ending with a poly(A)-addition site. Two exons encode the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences common to the ld and sd chains, and another exon encodes the additional 261 amino acids found in the cytoplasmic domain of the ld chain. The carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids common to the ld and sd chains and the 3' untranslated region common to their mRNAs are encoded by a single large exon of 3475 base pairs that ends with a second poly(A)-addition site. Sequences from the 13-kilobase intron that separates the exons encoding the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the molecule hybridize to a 2-kilobase poly(A)+ RNA transcript of unknown identity. This description of the chicken N-CAM gene provides a basis for determining the mechanisms that regulate the differential expression of the N-CAM polypeptide chains during development.\r"

In productively infected cells, the alpha genes are expressed first, and a virion protein, the alpha-trans-inducing factor (alpha-TIF), acts in trans to enhance their expression. Induction of the alpha genes by alpha-TIF requires the presence of a trans-induction cis-acting site (alpha-TIC), and one to three homologs of the alpha-TIC sequence are contained in the regulatory domains of all alpha genes. We report that small DNA fragments from regulatory domains of alpha 0, alpha 4, and alpha 27 genes containing alpha-TIC homologs formed complexes with host but not viral proteins. DNase protection studies indicated that the major host protein complex alpha-H1 detected in DNA gel retardation assays bound asymmetrically across the alpha-TIC site. All DNA fragments containing alpha-TIC homologs, but not those lacking the homolog, competed for the binding of this complex. The location of the binding site of the other host proteins is not yet known. Simian virus 40 DNA fragments containing a homolog of the alpha-TIC sequence also competed with herpes simplex virus DNA fragments carrying authentic alpha-TIC homologs for the alpha-H1 protein complex.\r"

One model links the process to DNA replication, proposing that it occurs by not remethylating cytosine on newly synthesized DNA. An alternative model argues that hypomethylation results from excision of part or all of the 5-methylcytosine. We were able to test whether hypomethylation can occur without replication by analysis of methylation changes in the delta-crystallin genes of the chicken lens. During embryonic development a large fraction of cells in the lens stops dividing as part of the differentiation process. Shortly after this stage, the delta-crystallin genes in samples of the whole lens become hypomethylated, suggesting the possibility that this process might be occurring in the subset of cells that is no longer dividing. We found that hypomethylation of these genes does occur in postmitotic lens cells, a result that implicates an excision mechanism in this tissue.\r"

The NH2-terminal EGF-like domain contains beta-hydroxyaspartic acid, which has been identified in vitamin K-dependent proteins. The following EGF-like repeat has a very pronounced sequence homology (10 consecutive residues identical) to one of the EGF-like units in the EGF precursor. We now show that, in protein S, this EGF-like repeat has one beta-hydroxyasparagine residue formed by hydroxylation of asparagine. The two COOH-terminal EGF-like repeats also contain beta-hydroxyasparagine, an amino acid not previously found in proteins. Sequence comparisons have enabled us to identify a consensus sequence that seems to be required by the hydroxylase(s).\r"

It has been suggested that different P450c17 isozymes mediate these activities in the adrenal gland and testis. We sequenced 423 of the 509 amino acids (83%) of the porcine adrenal enzyme; based on this partial sequence, a 128-fold degenerate 17-mer was synthesized and used to screen a porcine adrenal cDNA library. This yielded a 380-base cloned cDNA, which in turn was used to isolate several human adrenal cDNAs. The longest of these, lambda hac17-2, is 1754 base pairs long and includes the full-length coding region, the complete 3'-untranslated region, and 41 bases of the 5'-untranslated region. This cDNA encodes a protein of 508 amino acids having a predicted molecular weight of 57,379.82. High-stringency screening of a human testicular cDNA library yielded a partial clone containing 1303 identical bases. RNA gel blots and nuclease S1-protection experiments confirm that the adrenal and testicular P450c17 mRNAs are indistinguishable. These data indicate that the testis possesses a P450c17 identical to that in the adrenal. The human amino acid sequence is 66.7% homologous to the corresponding regions of the porcine sequence, and the human cDNA and amino acid sequences are 80.1 and 70.3% homologous, respectively, to bovine adrenal P450c17 cDNA. Both comparisons indicate that a central region comprising amino acid residues 160-268 is hypervariable among these species of P450c17. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of P450c17 with two other human steroidogenic cytochromes P450 show much greater homology with P450c21 (28.9%), another microsomal enzyme, than with P450scc (12.3%), a mitochondrial enzyme.\r"

Among the major lineages the fragment patterns are essentially completely different, while within the major lineages various degrees of divergence are found. Molecular evolutionary trees were constructed using the method of Nei and Li to estimate the percent nucleotide sequence divergence among strains from the fraction of fragments shared. Defined groups, such as species or subspecies within the major lineages, are also grouped by nuclear DNA comparisons. Within the donovani complex, we find Leishmania donovani chagasi and Leishmania donovani infantum to be as similar as strains within Leishmania donovani donovani, consistent with the proposal by other workers that New World visceral leishmaniasis originated quite recently.\r"

  ".W": "Within the human gamma-crystallin gene cluster polymorphic Taq I sites are present. These give rise to three sets of allelic fragments from the gamma-crystallin genes. Together these restriction fragment length polymorphisms define eight possible haplotypes, three of which (Q, R, and S) were found in the Dutch and English population. A fourth haplotype (P) was detected within a family in which a hereditary Coppock-like cataract of the embryonic lens nucleus occurs in heterozygotes. Haplotype P was found only in family members who suffered from cataract, and all family members who suffered from cataract had haplotype P. The absolute correlation between the presence of haplotype P and cataract within this family shows that the gamma-crystallin gene cluster and the locus for the Coppock-like cataract are closely linked [logarithm of odds (lod) score of 7.58 at its maximum at phi = 0]. This linkage provides genetic evidence that the primary cause of a cataract in humans could possibly be a lesion in a crystallin gene.\r"

Six members of this multigene family have been assigned to five chromosomes in the human genome. The two type I genes, alpha 1 and alpha 2, are located on chromosomes 17 and 7, respectively, and the alpha 1 (II) gene is located on chromosome 12. Our recent mapping of the alpha 1 (III) and alpha 2 (V) genes to the q24.3----q31 region of chromosome 2 provided the only evidence that the collagen genes are not entirely dispersed. To further determine their organization, we and others localized the alpha 1 (IV) gene to chromosome 13 and in our experiments sublocalized the gene to band q34 by in situ hybridization. Here we show the presence of the alpha 2 type IV locus also on the distal long arm of chromosome 13 by hybridizing a human alpha 2 (IV) cDNA clone to rodent-human hybrids and to metaphase chromosomes. To our knowledge, these studies represent the only demonstration of linkage between genes encoding both polypeptide chains of the same collagen type.\r"

The other molecule (Mr, 42,000) is found labeled only in supernates of [35S]methionine-labeled cells and reacts with antibodies against Qb-1. Analysis of mutant and recombinant mouse strains demonstrates that both soluble class I molecules are encoded in the Qa region. Pulse-chase experiments show that the Qa-2 molecules are released more slowly than Qb-1. It is proposed that Qb-1 molecules are secreted directly, whereas Qa-2 is first expressed on the cell surface and then processed to a soluble form.\r"

  ".W": "The gene encoding the human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the histidine-methionine amide (PHM-27) peptide hormone was isolated from lambda phage libraries. The human gene was found to be composed of seven exons spanning approximately 9 kilobase pairs. The first exon codes for an untranslated leader sequence, and the second exon codes for a putative signal peptide. DNA sequences coding for the VIP and PHM-27 hormones are located in two different exons. Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA suggested that a single copy of the VIP/PHM-27 gene is present in the human haploid genome. The expression of VIP/PHM-27 precursor mRNA in various tissues in the rat was analyzed by RNA gel blot hybridization. In the organs examined, expression was only detected in the brain and duodenum. RNA isolated from various regions of the rat brain--including the cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus--hybridized to both VIP- and PHM-27-specific probes. The same pattern of hybridization was found when VIP- and PHM-27-specific probes were used, suggesting that possible differences in the localization of VIP and PHM-27 peptides between different brain regions cannot be accounted for by differential RNA processing.\r"

Ga-67 uptake tended to be less in patients receiving therapy for P. carinii pneumonia. Chest radiographs were normal at least initially in three patients with abnormal scans and P. carinii pneumonia. Unusually prominent colonic activity was associated with infection in some patients. No lesions of Kaposi sarcoma showed tracer uptake. Gallium scanning is useful for detecting P. carinii pneumonia and other opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, but it is not useful for localizing Kaposi sarcoma.\r"

MR was often more helpful for characterization of neuromas, epidermoid cysts, exophytic gliomas, and vascular lesions, while CT was usually more informative for meningiomas, metastases, and tympanomastoid cholesteatomas. A specific diagnosis could be made with MR for most types of lesions through use of relaxation parameters and characteristic morphologic changes. Size, shape, location, and contour of the lesions, however, were generally more helpful for differential diagnosis than relaxation times. With the exception of metastatic lesions, cholesteatomas, and some meningiomas, MR was usually more helpful than CT in defining the full extent of the lesions and their relationships to contiguous structures. MR, because of its high accuracy in lesion detection, characterization, and localization, is a suitable primary diagnostic modality for evaluating patients with suspected CPA-PM lesions.\r"

Concentrations of sulbactam up to 12 micrograms/ml were detected in the CSF between 1 and 4 hr after dosing, the higher levels being present in the CSF of patients with the most severe meningeal inflammation. There were no significant differences in the concentrations achieved after single or multiple doses of sulbactam, and the concentrations were generally similar to the concurrent concentrations of ampicillin. It is concluded that these results as well as the antibacterial properties of sulbactam plus ampicillin support the evaluation of this combination as an alternative in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.\r"
