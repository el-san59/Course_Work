  ".W": "Pharmacokinetic monitoring is an important therapeutic goal of aminoglycoside therapy. The overall goal of this study was to identify specific patient groups that would derive the maximum benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring services. These groups are patient populations with high probabilities of achieving toxic or subtherapeutic concentrations. Out of a total population of 86 stable, noncritically ill patients, 27 toxic concentrations (trough greater than 2.0 micrograms/mL) occurred in 15 patients. In comparison to patients (n = 46) with therapeutic concentrations (trough less than 2.0 micrograms/mL, peak greater than 4.0 micrograms/mL), these patients were older (64 +/- 11 vs. 54 +/- 18 years; p less than 0.02) and had a higher percentage of females (66.7 vs. 37 percent; p less than 0.05). Those patients with subtherapeutic concentrations (43 concentrations in 25 patients) had higher estimated creatinine clearance values than those with therapeutic concentrations (94 +/- 45 vs. 74 +/- 27 mL/min; p less than 0.005). Probability assessment analysis of the data showed a sevenfold increase in toxic concentrations in patients above 50 years. Females over age 50 had 2.3 times the risk of developing toxic concentrations as males over age 50. In contrast, the development of low concentrations was not predicted by age or sex. Underdosage by greater than or equal to 30 percent was a reasonable predictor (75 percent) of low peak concentrations. Furthermore, toxic concentrations did not occur in patients who were underdosed, justifying dosage increases prior to obtaining serum concentrations in these patients. The group with the highest probability of attaining therapeutic concentrations was males receiving therapeutic doses who were under age 50 (85.5 percent).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 16 of the 25 patients, select 1.5-mm scans were obtained. These were retrospectively targeted by using a 20- to 25-cm field of view and a high-spatial-resolution algorithm. The CT and pathologic findings were compared in two patients in whom surgical specimens of the lung were available. CT findings included hilar and mediastinal adenopathy (n = 22), subpleural nodules (n = 19), and 1- to 10-mm-diameter nodules (n = 17) and irregular linear densities (n = 12), both mainly along the bronchovascular structures. High-resolution CT was superior to conventional CT in the assessment of subpleural nodules and irregular linear densities, but conventional CT was superior in the assessment of peribronchovascular nodules. The two gross pathologic specimens showed the sarcoid granulomas to be mostly along the lymphatics in the peribronchovascular sheath and, to a lesser extent, in subpleural and interlobar septal lymphatics. We conclude that the characteristic CT appearance of pulmonary sarcoidosis consists of small nodules and irregular linear densities along the bronchovascular bundles.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated patterns of abnormal lung parenchyma on CT scans in six specific chronic lung diseases and then applied those findings in the differential diagnosis of these lung parenchymal patterns in 56 subjects. There were 48 patients with chronic lung diseases (43 with histologic proof) consisting of usual interstitial pneumonia (n = 20), sarcoidosis (n = 16), lymphangitic carcinomatosis (n = 7), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 2), drug toxicity (n = 2), and eosinophilic granuloma (n = 1). Including eight CT scans of normal control subjects, 56 CT scans were assessed independently by two readers (R1 and R2). Chest radiographs, most of which were obtained within 1 week of CT examination, were available in 48 of the 56 subjects. CT scans were evaluated for specific parenchymal features including disease distribution, lung distortion, thickening of bronchovascular bundles and polygon walls, bronchiectasis, cysts, and nodules, to determine the association of each abnormal feature with the different diseases. Diagnosis was then made from the overall CT appearance of the lungs and, on a separate occasion, from the appearance of the chest radiograph. The correct diagnosis was made from the CT appearance in 54 of 56 patients (R1) and in 50 of 56 patients (R2). Correct diagnoses were made from the chest radiographs in 42 of 48 patients (R1) and 43 of 48 patients (R2). We have identified features that are reproducible and useful when describing CT scans of patients with chronic lung diseases. Interpretation of the appearance of the lung on CT scans was accurate in diagnosing usual interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.\r"

We retrospectively examined 780 consecutive cholescintigrams to (1) determine the positive predictive value at 1 hr of this sign for acute cholecystitis and (2) ascertain if the presence or absence of this finding could differentiate acute from gangrenous cholecystitis. Pericholecystic hepatic activity was present at 1 hr in 48 (34%) of 141 scans in which the gallbladder was not visualized, and cholecystectomy was performed within 6 days of scintigraphy. Forty-five of these patients had acute and three had chronic cholecystitis (94% positive predictive value for acute cholecystitis). In addition, 57% of patients with gangrenous cholecystitis exhibited pericholecystic hepatic activity, and the frequency of this finding was significantly higher (p less than .006) in gangrenous than in acute cholecystitis. In summary, pericholecystic hepatic uptake is a valuable secondary sign in the cholescintigraphic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The significance of the finding is (1) a high positive predictive value for acute disease at 1 hr and (2) a statistically significant increased frequency in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis.\r"

Twenty-seven partial hepatectomies performed in the 25 patients included right lobectomy in 11, trisegmentectomy in two, left lobectomy in five, and wedge resection in nine. By using vascular landmarks, demonstration of the falciform ligament, and the presence of surgical clips, we correctly identified the type of partial hepatectomy in 21 of the 25 patients. The signal intensity of the resection margin was similar to that of the remaining parenchyma in 16 of 18 patients and was poorly defined and had a higher signal intensity (T2-weighted image) in the remaining two. Liver regeneration was observed on serial MR scans 2-16 months after surgery. Findings related to chemotherapy, including periportal changes and inhomogeneous appearance of the liver, were shown in six of eight patients. Tumor recurrence was present in nine patients, either intrahepatic (seven patients) or at the resection margin (two patients), and was consistently identified with MR imaging. The ability of MR imaging to produce images without artifacts from surgical clips is helpful in displaying the MR appearance of the liver after partial hepatectomy. Anatomic landmarks, findings related to chemotherapy, and tumor recurrence were shown well.\r"

MR imaging was done with a 2.0-T superconducting magnet and spin-echo imaging. CT was done with single-bolus dynamic scans. On MR images, all 10 hemangiomas had a heterogeneous appearance. The main part of the tumor comprised uniform, well-defined, high-intensity areas on T2-weighted images, with increasing intensity ratios with prolongation of TR and TE. Other parts of the tumor were cleftlike and were of lower intensity than the remainder of the tumor on T1-weighted images and of higher intensity on heavily T2-weighted images. These parts corresponded to the areas of the tumor that were of lower density on dynamic bolus CT scans. Internal septa in the tumor of low intensity were also noted on all MR pulse sequences. These parts corresponded to low-density areas on delayed contrast-enhanced CT. Familiarity with the characteristics of the internal architecture of giant cavernous hemangiomas on MR imaging or dynamic bolus CT might be useful in making the correct diagnosis of this tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Renal artery branch injury resulting from stab wounds of iatrogenic origin or street violence is an important cause of renal hemorrhage. Over a period of 10 years we accurately diagnosed the injury and successfully managed the associated hemorrhage in 15 patients by using angiography and percutaneous embolization techniques. Nine branch injuries in eight patients were due to street knifings and seven injuries were complications of invasive medical procedures (four from renal biopsy, two from nephrostolithotomy, and one from nephrostomy). All patients had gross hematuria at the time of angiographic evaluation. False aneurysms were present in six patients (one with associated frank extravasation), false aneurysm/arteriovenous fistula in three, false aneurysm/arteriocaliceal fistula in one, and isolated arteriovenous fistula in two. Frank extravasation without associated false aneurysm/arteriovenous fistula was present in two. One patient had two injuries, an upper-pole false aneurysm and a lower-pole false aneurysm/arteriovenous fistula. In the eight patients injured in street knifings, hematuria recurred after surgical exploration and treatment. None of the 16 injuries involved the main renal artery. Gelfoam was used for embolization of nine lesions and steel coils for four. Three others were treated with Gelfoam plus coils. Hemostasis was achieved in all and none required subsequent surgery. Renal tissue loss was small to moderate (less than 30%) in 12 patients and large (30-50%) in three patients. Transient postembolization hypertension occurred in one of the latter. We consider selective angiography/embolization to be an effective and safe means for diagnosing and treating wounds of the renal artery branches.\r"

  ".W": "We made MR images of 39 autopsy specimens of the temporomandibular joint at 0.3 and 1.5 T and compared the images with anatomic cryosections. Imaging time and slice thickness were the same on scans made at each field strength. The purpose was to determine which field strength provides the best scans for imaging of the joint. Additionally, we used imaging times two and four times longer on the 0.3-T scanner to assess to what extent image quality and diagnostic accuracy could be improved. The cryosections showed that 27 of the joints were normal. Twelve had disk displacements. Ten of the joints with disk displacement also had disk deformities, and seven had bony abnormalities. Investigators who analyzed the MR images had no knowledge of the findings on the cryosections. The disk position, disk configuration, and bony abnormalities were correctly diagnosed in 85%, 77%, and 100%, respectively, on 1.5-T MR images compared with 46%, 41%, and 85%, respectively, on the 0.3-T images. When the imaging time was increased by a factor of four, the accuracy rate on the 0.3-T system became comparable to that of the 1.5-T MR scanner: 73% for disk position, 67% for disk configuration. The results suggest that the diagnostic quality of MR images of the temporomandibular joint is better on scans made at 1.5 T than on those done at 0.3 T when comparable imaging times are used.\r"

On CT the tumors were all sharply demarcated and smoothly marginated and rarely had associated edema. The lesions tended to be round or oval. The tumor matrix was most often hypo- or isodense with marked enhancement. Cyst formation, either micro- or macrocystic or combined, was frequently observed, and tumor calcification occurred occasionally. On MR the tumors appeared hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The radiologic appearances of juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas are quite characteristic. By using age of presentation, typical location, configuration, and enhancement patterns, the presurgical diagnosis of juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma can be made with a high index of confidence.\r"

Five patients had clinical signs of cerebral infarction. Of the remaining two patients, one was asymptomatic and the other had a long-standing occlusion and headaches. We correlated the MR findings with cerebral angiography in five patients and with CT scans in six patients. All occluded vessels demonstrated MR signal predominantly isointense to brain on proton-density- T1- and T2-weighted images. Since there is an absence of flow, the MR signal is based on the intrinsic properties of the arterial thrombus and possibly on the chronicity of the occlusion. The pathogenesis and histopathology of intravascular thrombus differ significantly from extravascular hematoma, which accounts for the differences in their MR signal characteristics. The demonstration of occluded intracranial vessels may solidify the diagnosis of stroke in cases in which clinical and/or CT findings are equivocal. In patients presenting with infarction, an occluded carotid artery by MR may obviate the need for angiography; however, the demonstration of a patent carotid in conjunction with infarction suggests the possibility of an embolus, which may require angiography. We believe that MR is a valuable adjunct to CT in evaluating patients with cerebrovascular infarction.\r"

  ".U": "89244535\r", 
  ".W": "Extruded lumbar intervertebral disks traditionally have been classified as posterior or central in location. A retrospective review of 250 MR imaging examinations of the lumbar spine that used mid- and high-field imagers revealed 145 positive studies, which included a significant number of extrusions extending anteriorly. With the lateral margin of the neural foramen/pedicle as the boundary, 29.2% of peripheral disk extrusions were anterior and 56.4% were posterior. In addition, a prevalence of 14.4% was found for central disk extrusions, in which there was a rupture of disk material into or through the vertebral body itself. The clinical state of neurogenic spinal radiculopathy accompanying posterior disk extrusion has been well defined; however, uncomplicated anterior and central disk extrusions also may be associated with a definite clinical syndrome. The vertebrogenic symptom complex includes (1) local and referred pain and (2) autonomic reflex dysfunction within the lumbosacral zones of Head. Generalized alterations in viscerosomatic tone potentially may also be observed. The anatomic basis for the mediation of clinical signs and symptoms generated within the disk and paradiskal structures rests with afferent sensory fibers from two primary sources: (1) posterolateral neural branches emanating from the ventral ramus of the somatic spinal root and (2) neural rami projecting directly to the paravertebral autonomic neural plexus. Thus, conscious perception and unconscious effects originating in the vertebral column, although complex, have definite pathways represented in this dual peripheral innervation associated with intimately related and/or parallel central ramifications. It is further proposed that the specific clinical manifestations of the autonomic syndrome are mediated predominantly, if not entirely, within the sympathetic nervous system. The directional differentiation of lumbar disk extrusions by MR, together with a clarification and appreciation of the accompanying clinical somatic and autonomic syndromes, should contribute both to understanding the specific causes as well as to establishing the appropriate treatment of acute and chronic signs and symptoms engendered by many nonspecific disease processes involving the spinal column.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen rabbit sciatic nerves undergoing experimental demyelination and 17 control nerves were imaged in vivo with a 0.3-T MR imaging system using a silicone chamber wrapped around the nerves to isolate them from surrounding tissues. Three pulse sequences were used for each nerve: (1) spin-echo 500/28 (TR/TE), (2) spin-echo 2000/56, and (3) inversion recovery 1000/300/30 (TR/TI/TE). Image intensity data were acquired for each nerve by placing a region of interest over the nerve and measuring pixel brightness within the region of interest by means of a computer algorithm. The mean signal intensity of the experimental nerve was then compared with the mean signal intensity of the contralateral control nerve on the same image. Histologic sections of the nerves were stained with Loyez's stain for myelin and thionin for glial cells. MR findings were then compared with histopathologic data. Experimental nerves showed distinct stages of demyelination. Two fundamental observations were surmised from the data: (1) Perceptible MR signal changes are associated with early nerve degeneration, in which there is demyelination in the absence of glial cell proliferation; these changes are appreciated as increased intensity on heavily T2-weighted sequence. In these nerves no signal changes are seen on T1-weighted sequences. (2) Perceptible MR signal changes are associated with more advanced nerve degeneration, in which there is an increase in the number of glial cells in the absence of further demyelination; these changes are appreciated as decreased intensity on T1-weighted sequences and markedly increased intensity on T2-weighted sequences, respectively. The results show that MR can distinguish stages of demyelination in degenerating nerves, thereby providing a powerful method for the diagnosis and characterization of demyelinating disease.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of MR phase-sensitive imaging for the quantification of blood flow in the carotid arteries was studied in two normal volunteers and six patients with carotid artery and/or cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of sensitizing the phase of the MR signal to blood flow velocity gated to different times in the cardiac cycle. Flow velocities and volumes were measured by using transverse planes in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and flow curves were generated. Measurements made by using flow phantoms correlated well with calculated results. The MR measurements yielded values between 250 and 580 ml/min for the total flow through each of the common carotid arteries in the two normal volunteers. Markedly reduced flow (about 50% below normal) was detected in a patient whose arteriogram showed severe occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In a second patient, who had a large frontal intracranial arteriovenous malformation noted by arteriography, the MR-quantified flow was abnormally high (about 1 liter/min). In the remaining four patients, the findings on phase-sensitive quantification were consistent with those expected from clinical and other laboratory studies (including arteriography and sonography). These preliminary findings suggest that MR phase mapping may be a feasible tool for the noninvasive quantification of carotid blood flow.\r"

Starvation induced a parallel decrease in body weight and diaphragmatic weight amounting to 18% of the control group. Diaphragmatic contractility was impaired in the ST group. This reduction was associated with a significant reduction in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) for all the frequencies of stimulation, except 20 Hz, in the ST animals as compared with the CTL animals; however, no significant difference in Pdi expressed per gram of diaphragmatic mass was observed. Endurance index was 0.63 +/- 0.01 1.4 +/- 0.02 in the ST and CTL animals (p less than 0.01), respectively. We conclude that a 4-d total fast produces a reduction in diaphragmatic weight, which is associated with a decreased diaphragmatic strength and reduced endurance capacity.\r"

It is likely that dehydration rather than protein catabolism was responsible for additional loss of fat-free mass in the 330-kcal/d group because the nitrogen deficit was not excessive. The thermic response to food was blunted only in the 330-kcal/d group whereas resting oxygen uptake decreased by equal amounts in both groups. There was a decrease in 24-h urinary noradrenaline in the 330-kcal/d group but plasma fT4 was sustained when compared with the 780-kcal/d group; fT3 decreased significantly more quickly in the 330-kcal/d group.

Multiple injury provoked distinct patterns of free amino acids in plasma and urine. Hypoaminoacidemia and hyperaminoaciduria were seen in severe trauma. There was a marked depletion of nonessential amino acids in plasma of trauma victims. In contrast, the urinary loss of all amino acids was increased 5-10 times. This enhanced loss in patients, however, represented only 2.1% of total N excreted compared with 0.7% in control subjects. Considerable variations were seen in the selectivity with which various amino acids were reabsorbed by renal tubules. This may partly be due to the abnormal pattern of amino acids presented to renal tubules.\r"

The addition of cocoa significantly reduced BHL (p less than 0.005) as well as the symptom score of both bloating (p less than 0.05) and cramping (p less than 0.025). Individual lactose intolerance levels ranged from 5% (basal milk) to 12.5% with an average of 7.8% upon consumption of 250 mL milk. Having both plain and cocoa formulas contain sucrose and carrageenan led to a conclusion that the suppressive effect of cocoa observed was independent of the presence of sucrose and carrageenan. Ninety-five percent of the subjects responded positively (BHL greater than 17 ppm) to the plain and 51% to the cocoa formula.\r"

Daily (one capsule) or periodic (two capsules 7 d/mo) multivitamin supplementation that included 1700 micrograms vitamin A per capsule did not significantly influence vitamin A serum values. The RDR test after 13 cycles was elevated in one individual who had taken OCs and the periodic multivitamin supplement. It reverted to normal after supplementation with vitamin A. A single high-dose vitamin A supplement (68,000 micrograms) did not change circulating levels of the vitamin. Among this population there is little evidence that use of estrogen-containing OCs for greater than 1 y resulted in a physiologically significant deterioration of vitamin A status.\r"

Urine excretion and total body retention of isotope and the selenite-exchangeable metabolic pool (Se-EMP) were calculated. Limiting dietary ascorbic acid to about 20 mg/d appeared to reduce the time-related retention of absorbed selenite and the size of Se-EMP. Compared with a diet providing 1 g ascorbic acid/d the low ascorbic acid intake was associated with a lower fractional absorption of the isotope, a reduced retention of the label, and a smaller Se-EMP. These data and those previously obtained in subjects with more usual ascorbic acid intakes point to a possible important role for ascorbic acid in the maintenance of Se homeostasis.\r"

Absorption averaged 12.4 +/- 0.9% with a high-Cu diet (7.53 mg/d) and retention was strongly positive at first, decreasing linearly with time. The study demonstrated that Cu absorption is strongly dependent on dietary Cu level and that Cu balance can be achieved by most young men from a diet of 0.8 mg Cu/d. These results suggest that current dietary Cu recommendations may be higher than necessary. The apparent regulation of Cu absorption and endogenous losses would tend to protect humans from Cu deficiency and toxicity.\r"

Logistic regression analysis showed that the predictive power of weight-, height-, and age-based indicators improved after adding AC whereas predictive power of AC did not improve after adding weight-based indicators.

Both methods gave relatively constant percentage recoveries for Cr2O3 contents from 0.4 to 10 mg. Over this range, mean (+/- SD) percentage recoveries of Cr2O3 for sodium peroxide fusion and the perchloric acid method were 75.5 +/- 4.3 and 89.9 +/- 2.5, respectively. As long as percentage recovery is constant, the transit time as determined by calculation of the time of 80% excretion of the total recovered Cr2O3 is not affected.

The authors identified prominent interstitial pneumonia (defined as an inflammatory reaction predominantly involving alveolar septa) in 9 of 43 autopsied patients with CF. Lungs from these nine were studied by light microscopy to determine the histopathologic features, clinicopathologic correlates, and potential causes of CF-associated interstitial pneumonia. Two histologic variants were identified, alveoloseptal (in which the inflammatory reaction was confined to the alveolar wall) and organizing (in which intraalveolar granulation tissue was present in addition to septal inflammation), which respectively affected four and five patients. Cholesterol deposits and capillary proliferation were prominent associated features in some patients. Interstitial pneumonia was not diagnosed antemortem and was identified on chest roentgenogram in only two patients. There were no distinctive clinical features associated with different histologic subtypes, nor did histologic or clinical data identify a specific cause(s) of interstitial pneumonia. The authors conclude that CF-associated interstitial pneumonia, although usually an incidental finding at autopsy, may potentially contribute to respiratory impairment and death. Although there are multiple possible causes of interstitial lung injury associated with CF, the authors were unable to identify, with certainty, the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia in any patient in this study.\r"

There was a significantly higher prevalence of IF in patients with diabetes mellitus, most of whom had type 2 diabetes. No statistically significant relationships between IF and the cause of death or other clinical conditions were found. Acinar atrophy, periductal fibrosis, and nonpapillary ductal hyperplasia were often associated with IF. All cases with periductal fibrosis (PF) also showed IF, so PF may be a part of this process. Eight cases (11%) of chronic terminal pancreatitis were noted, which is defined as a lesion of moderate to severe chronic inflammation and various degree of IF in cases without any clinical evidence of pancreatic disease before death.\r"

Data were obtained with the use of colonic adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma of the lung, mammary adenocarcinoma, and spleen with a plasma cell leukemic infiltrate. The parameters examined were G0-G1 DNA staining intensity, %G0-G1, percent coefficient of variation (%CV), percent debris, and TNP staining intensity. The results showed that variations in the fixation of solid tumor significantly affected flow cytometric-derived parameters. In this study, paraffin-embedded tissue (PET) fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (NBF) produced the best results, with a %CV below 4.7, whereas fixatives such as Zenker's and B-5 produced poor %CVs (above 6.0) or uninterpretable TNP and light scatter data. These data suggest that a portion of all tissue samples be fixed in NBF to allow for subsequent analysis by fixative-sensitive assays such as DNA in situ hybridization and flow cytometry.\r"

Suspension cultures of the blood light density (LD) cells, LD cells depleted of T-cells and Mos (LD-T-Mo), and cocultures of LD-T-Mo with Mos were performed. NAP synthesis occurred in a normal fashion in LD cell cultures of five of seven patients with CML and of two patients with MM. The NAP synthesis was very slight or did not occur in cultures of LD-T-Mo cells of all patients with chronic-phase CML and MM. However, addition of allogeneic or autologous Mos to the LD-T-Mo cultures restored the NAP synthesis. These results confirm the previous finding that the low or absent NAP in CML is caused by a relative reduction in the monocyte mass and they further indicate the mechanism to be the same for the low or absent NAP in patients with MM. The results also indicate that the NAP-synthesizing capacity of neutrophils of CML and MM patients and the NAP synthesis-inducing capacity of the Mos of patients with CML are normal.\r"

Eight bone marrow aspirates from 8 children and 23 trephine core bone marrow biopsies from 16 children who had had evaluation for hematologic abnormalities not associated with cutaneous mastocytosis served as a control population. Eosinophilia was a prominent finding in bone marrows of 9 of 17 patients who had cutaneous mastocytosis. Increased mast cell numbers in bone marrow aspirates were observed in 5 children with cutaneous mastocytosis (5 of 16) and in 2 of the control children (2 of 8). Examination of the trephine core bone marrow biopsies obtained from patients with cutaneous mastocytosis demonstrated focal perivascular and paratrabecular aggregates consisting of mast cells, eosinophils, and early myeloid cells in 10 of 15 individuals. Similar lesions were observed in trephine core bone marrow biopsies of 3 of 16 control patients. The focal mast cell lesions characteristic of adult systemic mastocytosis were not observed. The authors conclude that cutaneous mastocytosis in the pediatric age group is rarely associated with definitive bone marrow findings suggestive of systemic mast cell disease and that this observation is consistent with previous reports that cutaneous mastocytosis in the majority of pediatric cases resolves by adulthood.\r"

Error rates for routine technologists were 9.3% in the ER and 15.3% in the NICU. Error rates for the two instruments were higher than those for technologists with samples from the ER but could be reduced to 4-5% if instrument flags and additional criteria were used to signal the need for a conventional differential. Instrument error rates were higher yet with NICU samples, and specificity was very low (10% for each device). There were small differences between the instruments in detection of immature neutrophils, but flags from the H-1 were more specific (except for detection of nucleated red blood cells in samples from the ER). If either instrument were used in an adult ER and flags and additional criteria were used to signal the need for conventional differentials, 64-75% fewer manual counts would be performed with no decrease in accuracy and a considerable improvement in turnaround time.\r"

In contrast to other alkaline hemoglobin electrophoresis systems, this system provides adequate separation of HbA0 from its glycosylated form. A band anodal to HbA0 was identified as glycohemoglobin; in vitro synthesis of glycohemoglobin confirmed the migration pattern of the glycohemoglobin band. In both in vitro synthesis studies and in a series of 48 patients, quantitation of the glycohemoglobin band by densitometry showed good correlation (r = 0.99 and r = 0.96, respectively) with values obtained by a standard column chromatographic technique. Beyond reliable quantitation of glycohemoglobin, this system offers two advantages. First, it discriminates hemoglobin F and hemoglobins with low isoelectric points that may coincidentally be measured as glycohemoglobin by other techniques. Second, it provides simultaneous detection of common hemoglobinopathies, a necessity for accurate reporting of glycohemoglobin in the diabetic patient with a concomitant hemoglobinopathy.\r"

Most bladders demonstrated several patterns of development rather than a uniform appearance. The most frequently observed pattern was that of scattered smooth muscle fibers seen in 33 of 40 (82.5%) cases. The rarity of carcinomatous invasion limited to the tunica muscularis mucosae is emphasized. The authors conclude that the potential for overstaging bladder carcinomas because of misinterpretation of this structure is small.\r"

  ".W": "The recent availability of monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive to T- or B-lineage antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has permitted the adaptation of frozen-section immunodiagnostic criteria to paraffin-embedded tissue. Among a variety of reactive lymphoid processes, monoclonal antibody L26 showed a pattern of staining consistent with pan-B reactivity. Antibodies L60 (Leu-22) and UCHL-1 showed a pan-T and T-subset pattern of reactivity, respectively. In benign processes, L26 and L60 (or UCHL-1) were not coexpressed. In contrast, among 77 B-lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 42% showed aberrant co-expression of L26 and L60. The L26+/L60+ phenotype was most common in small lymphocytic lymphomas (80%) but was also noted in one third of diffuse large cell lymphomas. Expression of UCHL-1 was not identified in B-lineage neoplasms but was found, along with L60, on four of five T-lineage lymphomas studied as controls. The authors conclude that the anomalous coexpression of L60 and L26 antigens is a unique feature of B-lineage lymphomas and can be used for the immunodiagnosis of these malignancies in routinely processed tissue.\r"

These findings suggest that megakaryoblasts may be closely related to myelomonoblasts, that they have the potential to partially differentiate along multiple phenotypic lines, and that aberrant phenotypes can occur that do not correspond to known stages of normal maturation. The authors illustrate the difficulty in classification of these aberrant phenotypes by standard cytochemical and morphologic criteria.\r"

The S. sanguis II and nutritionally deficient streptococcal strain had similar antibiograms being resistant to penicillin; neither produced beta-lactamase. No plasmids were found. The restriction endonuclease chromosomal digestion patterns of these isolates were unique and epidemiologically unrelated to each other. Dot blot DNA-DNA hybridizations, using the nutritionally deficient streptococcal DNA as the probe, showed homology to the preceding clinical isolates, S. sanguis II and S. mitis, at 15.4% and 45.1% hybridization levels, respectively. The nutritionally deficient streptococcus was only 4.2% homologous to a S. mitis ATCC strain and another nutritionally deficient streptococci isolate. Therefore, this patient had endocarditis with three distinct streptococcal strains.\r"

Children with growth failure consumed significantly less energy and zinc than those children growing well. The dietary intakes of the 3 children with nutritional dwarfing were the most markedly deficient in total energy, fat, and micronutrients. These data suggest that the diagnosis and dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia have potentially adverse consequences. Overzealous application of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet may lead to growth failure due to inadequate intake of energy, vitamins, and minerals. Careful monitoring of children receiving modified fat and cholesterol intakes for hypercholesterolemia treatment is mandatory to ensure adequate nutrition for normal growth and development.\r"

One hundred sixty-two children (mean +/- SD age, 3.6 +/- 2.1 years) were evaluated. All were referred for immediate roentgenography after ingestion and followed up daily by telephone for 5 days. Sixty-six patients (41%) did comply and 96 (59%) did not comply with the roentgenogram recommendation. A coin was visualized in the esophagus of 13 patients (20%); 11 were symptomatic and 2 were asymptomatic at the time of ingestion. Symptomatic patients had a 42% risk of a coin later being located in the esophagus compared with a 5% risk for asymptomatic patients. The asymptomatic patients with lodged coins passed them without difficulty after the administration of oral fluids. Nineteen percent of the patients who did not undergo roentgenography were symptomatic and all became asymptomatic within 24 hours of ingestion. There was no difference in morbidity between the group that underwent roentgenography and the group that did not undergo roentgenography at 5 days after ingestion. Children who are asymptomatic at the time of coin ingestion may not need routine roentgenography if they can tolerate oral fluids and telephone follow-up is available.\r"

The surveys were mailed to 329 hospitals affiliated with pediatric training programs as the institutions most likely to attempt to comply with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. Representatives from 199 (60%) of the programs responded. The programs had a range of 12 to 350 pediatric beds in children's hospitals (27%), pediatric wards (69%), or general hospitals (4%). Only nine hospitals were \"smoke-free,\" ie, having no designated indoor area for smoking. Another 35 had \"restrictive\" policies allowing smoking in only a single site or two preselected sites. Pediatric hospitals or wards were no more likely to have smoke-free policies than general hospitals. Existence of smoke-free or restrictive policies was unrelated to any other factor examined. Smoke-free and restrictive policies were more likely to be rigorously enforced but not more likely to engender formal challenges. Although almost all policies had been recently or are being revised, pediatric hospitals and wards remain remiss in controlling childhood smoke exposure.\r"

Major extracardiac changes most often involved the craniofacial region, central nervous system, and limbs. Karyotypes were normal, and no distinctive syndromes or anatomic patterns were identified. Since the timing of Ebstein's anomaly is quite precise, ascertainment of such cases on the basis of cardiac morphology may enhance the understanding of etiology and pathogenesis. Both causes and mechanisms may well be diverse, for the clinical histories and anatomic findings in present and previously reported cases vary considerably. Isolated Ebstein's anomaly may develop from topographically and temporally localized damage. Ebstein's anomaly with extracardiac defects may involve damage during a longer, and perhaps earlier, period.\r"

  ".W": "Computer simulations can provide both a clinical experience for teaching problem solving and a method of documenting a student's clinical reasoning style. The CAMPS simulation consists of approximately 500 items describing a patient's history, physical examination and laboratory results, and treatments. The student has full option to select any item in any order, producing a wide variation of performances. Since all of the students interact with the same clinical problems, the faculty member can make comparisons of that individual student with the class. From the record of the simulation encounter, the person responsible for student evaluations can prepare a narrative that lists the overall performance, the specific omissions and commissions, and comparisons with the class. Experience with a group of 111 students in a basic pediatric course showed that this method of documenting clinical inquiry detected a variety of levels of performances. Comparisons of the results of these tests with the faculty observations showed that 16% of these students who were judged to be very good or excellent in problem solving by the faculty performed at least 1 SD below the class average on the simulations. This project highlights the power of computer simulations to provide documentation of student performance with the additional benefit of a cost of less than $1 per student.\r"

Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis was diagnosed if all the following criteria were satisfied: (1) a CSF culture positive for S epidermidis within 48 hours, (2) a blood culture positive for S epidermidis with antibiotic sensitivities identical to those of the CSF isolate, and (3) clinical symptomatology. Lumbar puncture yielded white blood cell counts lower than 10 x 10(6)/L in 8 infants. Two subjects had CSF white blood cell counts of 11 x 10(6)/L and 14 x 10(6)/L. Cerebrospinal fluid glucose (2.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L) and protein (1.15 +/- 0.32 g/L) concentrations were also unremarkable. Infants were treated with parenteral antibiotics for 19 +/- 5 days.

In the first phase of the study, 15 neonates were studied during breast-feeding and bottle-feeding; in the second phase, 15 were evaluated during bottle-feeding of expressed human milk and formula. A reduction in inspiratory duration was observed with all feeding regimens. Moreover, significant prolongation in expiratory duration and reduction in breathing frequency were observed during bottle-feeding of formula and expressed human milk (compared with control); these effects were greater with formula feeding. Higher sucking frequency was observed during breast-feeding compared with bottle-feeding; no difference in suckling frequency or sucking pressure was observed between bottle-feeding of expressed human milk and formula. We conclude that most of the differences in sucking and breathing patterns between breast- and bottle-feeding can be attributed to nutrient delivery rather than nutrient composition.\r"

  ".W": "An abnormally low concentration of zinc in mother's milk has been associated with clinical nutritional zinc deficiency in premature and term newborns. Defective mammary gland secretion of zinc was suggested as the causative factor. We investigated whether low milk zinc concentration might be reflected in an abnormality of the distribution of zinc between casein, whey, and fat components of the milk, in a reduction in the levels of milk citrate, a zinc-binding ligand, or in abnormal levels of copper and iron. Milk from mothers of four low-birth-weight infants was identified as being deficient in zinc content for the lactational stage. One infant had clinical signs of nutritional zinc deficiency. For two of the three infants with subclinical deficiencies in whom balance study data were available, the apparent zinc balance was negative (-5.7 and -6.0 mumol/kg per day). These milks were examined for content and distribution of zinc, copper, and iron, and citrate concentration. Although total zinc concentration (4.5 to 17.2 mumol/L) was below the 95% prediction interval (15.2 to 59.7 mumol/L) for the lactational stage, the distribution of zinc was normal between milk components. Levels of citrate (1.46 to 5.13 mmol/L) were also within normal limits, as were levels of copper (0.27 to 0.85 mumol/L and iron (0.41 to 1.13 mumol/L). We concluded that there was no indirect evidence of a secretory abnormality in milk zinc deficiency, but speculated that there might instead be an abnormality of zinc uptake by the mammary gland from the plasma.\r"

This paper will review the specific issues in trials for short term (4-8 wk) peptic ulcer disease, demonstrating that controlled trials utilizing placebo are worthwhile, are safe, offer distinct advantages over alternative trials, and impose no real ethical conflict. The ethics regarding the use of a placebo for a controlled trial have been reviewed previously in this column (1). Placebo controls are appropriate in therapeutic trials when 1) standard therapy is either unavailable, of unproven efficacy, or possesses unacceptable side effects, 2) placebo itself is an effective therapy, or 3) the ongoing disease has little adverse effect on the patient. Furthermore, the use of placebo is considered advisable (2), \"when the disease process is characterized by frequent spontaneous exacerbations and remissions.\" Certainly, peptic ulcer is such a disease. It has been argued that the decision to utilize placebo might be between only two individuals, the physician and his patient (3), but realistically, many more must approve the trial, through multi-center participation, involvement by the pharmaceutical industry, and peer review (including human research committee approvals).\r"

Good results were obtained in patients with first- and second-degree hemorrhoids. Heater probe coagulation therapy was conducted in a total of 264 patients. Good results were achieved in 90% of patients with first- and second-degree hemorrhoids, minor pain and bleeding occurred in approximately 10% of these patients, and one patient with third-degree hemorrhoids who was treated with this technique failed to respond and required surgery. Ultroid d.c. current therapy was utilized in 192 patients, and follow-up results were good in 95% of these cases. Minor bleeding occurred in four patients. It is concluded that all three techniques, performed on an outpatient basis with little or no sedation, are effective modalities for first- and second-degree hemorrhoids, but that Ultroid d.c. current therapy is associated with less discomfort and fewer complications and that Ultroid therapy may yield good results in some patients with third- or even fourth-degree hemorrhoids.\r"

Factors used were age, sex, therapeutic environment, duration of present ulcer pain, past history of gastric ulcer, the amount of tobacco, alcohol, and coffee consumed before and during the treatment, the period until symptoms disappeared after the commencement of the treatment, and the characteristics of the ulcers themselves. Of these factors, the five factors that had a significant delaying effect on the healing of gastric ulcers were: 1) having a past history of gastric ulcers, 2) symptoms not disappearing within 1 wk after the commencement of the treatment, 3) size over 20 mm, 4) ulcer located in an angle, and 5) round or oval shape of the ulcer. The patients with less than one of the unfavorable factors (n = 36) had the best healing rate (97.2%), compared with those with two (n = 61), three (n = 39), or four or more (n = 12) unfavorable factors. The healing rate of the latter three groups was 75.4%, 53.8%, and 33.3%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Thus, a prognostic score based on these five factors represents the severity of gastric ulcers with regard to the healing in patients prescribed cimetidine.\r"

Neither coffee use, amount of coffee consumed daily, or cumulative coffee consumption before disease onset altered the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. A decreased risk of ulcerative colitis was associated with alcohol consumption before disease onset among never-smokers only. This risk declined as daily alcohol consumption increased. These results suggest that alcohol consumption may lower ulcerative colitis incidence.\r"

In conventional stainings, MBs were detected in only six of 26 (23%) patients with alcoholic liver disease, and nine of 63 (14%) patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. On the other hand, MBs were detected in 20 of 26 (77%) patients with alcoholic liver disease, and 25 of 63 (40%) patients with nonalcoholic liver disease by immunoperoxidase staining. Immunohistochemically detected MBs were shown to possess the ultrastructural characteristics of MBs by immunoelectronmicroscopy in the four specimens. Our result indicates that the small MBs are not rare in nonalcoholic liver disease, and the presence of immunohistochemically detected small MBs is not a good marker of an alcoholic etiology.\r"

There was a wide spectrum of underlying liver disease in these 23 patients; most frequent was alcoholic cirrhosis. Five were in modified Child's class A, 14 were in class B, and four were in class C. Fourteen of 23 patients had some complication associated with peritoneovenous shunt placement; clinical consumptive coagulopathy, infection, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage while hospitalized were most frequent. Fifteen of 23 died, 12 while hospitalized or within 1 month of hospitalization. Death in eight patients appeared to be related to shunt placement and was due to sepsis in five, hepatorenal syndrome with an obstructed shunt in one, consumptive coagulopathy in one, and pulmonary edema in one. All modified Child's class C patients, six of seven patients with clinical consumptive coagulopathy, and all patients with a preshunt total bilirubin greater than 3.7 mg/dl died while hospitalized or within 1 month of hospitalization. This review supports studies showing that placement of peritoneovenous shunts for refractory ascites has a high morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced liver disease, and does not support their use in the management of refractory ascites.\r"

On admission, laboratory data were normal except for slightly abnormal liver function tests. One patient (case 1) had a 5.1-cm white firm CCC with several small daughter lesions around it which was enhanced late in computed tomography, and a 2.1-cm well-circumscribed HCC with a pseudocapsule; the two were situated very close to one another in the right posterior segment of the liver. Another patient (case 2) had a small 1.5-cm CCC in the anterior superior area, and 6 yr after the first resection, alpha-fetoprotein gradually increased and a 4-cm HCC was detected anew and resected; the preoperative diagnosis made by US and ethiadol-computed tomography was correct. The histopathological diagnosis of the noncancerous portion was chronic active hepatitis in both cases. However, it changed to precirrhosis in case 2 during the follow-up.\r"

The esophageal varices were controlled, but the hemodynamics of the portal vein subsequently underwent gradual change and attacks of hepatic encephalopathy occurred frequently the following year. Therefore, the shunt was closed after about 2 yr. Hepatic encephalopathy disappeared after this surgery, but the varices obviously worsened on the 5th postoperative day and bled spontaneously on the 33rd postoperative day. A distal splenorenal shunt constructed 35 days after the operation resulted in the reduction, but not the complete disappearance, of esophageal varices. Episodes of hepatic encephalopathy or bleeding from the esophageal varices were not observed in the 24 months following the second shunt surgery.\r"

Twenty-seven percent (68/247) of all patients were transferred permanently to hemodialysis after a mean of 15 +/- 14 months of CAPD. An additional 29% transferred temporarily one or more times during the study period (mean time of peritoneal dialysis, 35 +/- 23 months). The reasons for permanent transfer to hemodialysis were catheter infections (15/68, 22%), peritonitis (13/68, 19%), catheter infections associated with peritonitis (10/68, 15%), patient preference (9/68, 13%), mechanical problems (4/68, 6%), noncompliance (7/68, 10%), inadequate clearance or ultrafiltration (6/68, 9%), with other reasons for the remainder (4/68, 6%). Temporary transfers to hemodialysis were also mainly due to catheter infections (32%), peritonitis (23%), and simultaneous catheter infections and peritonitis (24%). Catheter infection rates were much higher in the groups that permanently and temporarily were transferred to hemodialysis in comparison with those patients who remained on peritoneal dialysis. We conclude that catheter infections are a leading cause of both temporary and permanent transfer of CAPD patients to hemodialysis.\r"

  ".U": "89244797\r", 
  ".W": "Urea kinetic modelling was performed serially, over 24 months, on 55 patients undergoing hemodialysis and eight patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. The data obtained, together with changes in therapy aimed at increasing or decreasing the normalized dose of dialysis [KT/V (urea)], suggested the dependence of dietary protein intake and protein catabolic rate (PCR; g/kg/d) on the KT/V (urea). The studies also indicated that the nature of this relationship may be dependent upon the dialysis treatment used; dialysis by AN69S membrane hemodialyzers required less KT/V (urea) than hemodialysis by cellulosic membranes to obtain a given PCR. This difference may be explained by the beneficial effect of removal of \"middle molecular weight\" uremic toxins by the AN69S membrane, which has a different solute clearance profile than the cellulosic membrane. The studies also indicated a similar relationship between PCR and KT/V (urea) for peritoneal dialysis. With this form of therapy, however, it is difficult to obtain a PCR greater than 1 g/kg/d without first achieving very high values for KT/V (urea). It is postulated that this is due to an independent adverse effect of peritoneal dialysate in suppressing appetite. The data presented suggest that the conclusions of the National Cooperative Dialysis Study may be reinterpreted by assigning a major role to the nutritional status of patients in morbidity, with satisfactory nutritional status attained only in patients receiving adequate dialysis which, in turn, ensures control of plasma urea levels. Studies to prove this hypothesis are indicated.\r"

Echocardiographic measures of heart size and dynamics were compared across the total blood pressure distribution. Left ventricular stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction, minor axis shortening, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and peripheral vascular resistance were correlated with blood pressure levels. There were positive correlations (p less than .001) of cardiac output and stroke volume with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Left ventricular output and stroke volume were associated with measures of body size, especially height, weight, ponderal index, and body surface area (p less than .001). The left ventricular output and stroke volume increased with age and with systolic blood pressure quintiles in the four race-sex groups. With adjustment for systolic blood pressure and measures of body size, white males had greater cardiac output (1.25 l/minute for ages 18-22 years, p = .01) and stroke volume than black males. Black males had higher peripheral resistance (4.5 mm Hg/(l/minute), p = .01) than whites. These results suggest that different hemodynamic mechanisms operate in the early phase of hypertension in blacks vs. whites in this population.\r"

Hypoglycemic coma was induced and maintained for 1 hour by insulin administration. At the onset of isoelectric EEG, six rabbits were treated with FDP and five rabbits received 0.9% saline. The animals were killed by an overdose of barbiturate 60 minutes after hypoglycemic recovery with glucose. FDP-treated rabbits had lower arterial glucose concentration after 40 minutes of treatment (p less than .05) and a significantly greater difference between the oxygen content of arterial and venous blood after 40 minutes (p less than .01), and after 60 minutes (p less than .025) of FDP infusion than saline-treated rabbits. FDP-treated rabbits also had a lower cerebral glucose-oxygen index than did saline-treated rabbits (p less than .005, after 20 and 40 minutes of FDP infusion). FDP administration was followed by a return of EEG activity during hypoglycemia, whereas saline produced no such effect. After glucose infusion, EEG activity was improved in FDP-treated rabbits; in saline-treated rabbits, minimal or no EEG activity was observed. The data suggest the possibility that, at the doses given in this study, FDP is taken up and used as a metabolic substrate by the brain.\r"

We excluded dialyzed or patients who had received transplants and those with obvious potential nonrenal causes of anemia. Hct was a linear function of BUN and Scr (r = -0.48, and r = -0.67, respectively), and a curvilinear function of creatinine clearance (r = 0.68), all p less than .0001. Confidence interval analysis revealed a +/- 10 volume percent variation in Hct at any level of renal function. Sex was the only covariable that affected Hct independently of CRF. This study suggests that CRF may have a different effect on Hct in males and females and indicates that the range of Hct possible at a given level of CRF precludes attributing anemia to CRF with assurance.\r"

Monkeys treated with an Ovral-like regimen also exhibited adverse lipoprotein changes. Nevertheless, prevalence and extent of coronary artery plaques decreased. We conclude that estrogen is an important factor in the animals' \"female protection\" against diet-induced atherosclerosis. We also suggest that the lowering of high-density lipoproteins by the progestin component of higher-dose contraceptives is not necessarily atherogenic if a sufficiently potent exogenous estrogen is administered concomitantly.\r"

This study examines the kinetics of lipoprotein binding, the ability of polyanions to inhibit lipoprotein binding, the binding of anti-schistosomal antibodies to worms that have previously bound low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and the distribution of lipoproteins bound to the parasites. Lipoproteins in human serum (HS) and purified LDL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) in defined media were demonstrated on the surface of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni by fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy using a polyclonal goat anti-human apolipoprotein B antibody (anti-apo B). By fluorophotometric microscopy, lipoprotein binding began within 15 minutes and was largely completed within 3 hours of exposure. Lipoprotein binding saturated at 10% HS or 20 micrograms protein/300 microliters of purified LDL. Suramin inhibited LDL binding by 59% in a dose-dependent fashion. In the absence of LDL in the medium, 2 mM suramin dissociated 41% of bound LDL from the worm surface within 15 minutes and 10 mg/ml heparin dissociated 36%. The binding of human anti-schistosomal antibodies to schistosomula was inhibited by bound LDL. By fluorescence microscopy, serum or purified lipoproteins were distributed over the entire surface of the parasite with focal areas of high intensity. Ultrastructurally, reaction product was seen on the outer leaflet of the outer tegumental membrane and in aggregates and surrounding vesicular structures varying in diameter from 13 to 83 nm. These studies demonstrate that lipoproteins bind to the surface of schistosomula. The binding of lipoproteins is partially inhibited by polyanions, reduces the binding of human anti-schistosomal antibodies, and may help the parasite escape the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "To provide a morphologic basis for a better understanding of the \"aging\" of human skin, the authors studied the three-dimensional arrangement and chronological alterations of the fibrous components of the connective tissue using rats aged 2 weeks to 24 months with a new technique for scanning electron microscopy. These studies showed that with postnatal growth there was a dynamic rearrangement of the collagen and elastic fibers: an ordered arrangement of mature collagen bundles was attained by producing a distortion of the elastic fiber meshwork of relatively straight fibers. During adulthood, there was a subsequent tortuosity of the distorted elastic fibers coupled with an incomplete rebuilding of the elastic fiber network, laid down in a form to interlock with the collagen bundles. These changes provide a model for explaining manifestations of aged skin, such as laxity, sagging, and wrinkling. The tortuously fixed elastic fibers imply that they have been stretched and have lost their original elasticity and ability to restitute short and straight. Interlocking of both collagen and elastic fibers should disturb the two independent fibrous systems, as would normally be the case, and thus decrease tissue compliance.\r"

  ".U": "89244886\r", 
  ".W": "Previous micropuncture studies found that increasing the adrenergic nerve activity to the kidneys elevates the pre- and postglomerular arteriolar resistances and decreases the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (product of the filtration surface area and the hydraulic conductivity to water). To define the morphologic expression of this adrenergic effect on the glomerular capillaries the authors compared the microscopic vascular casts of entire glomeruli from right and left kidneys that were simultaneously perfusion-fixed during selective stimulation of only the left renal nerves. The maximum cross-sectional diameter of ten randomly chosen glomeruli from each stimulated and contralateral kidneys of eight rats averaged 123.7 +/- 4.1 mu in stimulated kidneys compared with a maximum diameter of 136.3 +/- 6.4 in the contralateral kidneys (P less than 0.001). The average perpendicular diameter of 100.4 +/- 1.5 mu in the stimulated kidneys was also significantly smaller than the average diameter of 110.7 +/- 1.9 mu in the contralateral kidneys (P less than 0.005). To examine if morphologic changes analogous to those found in whole glomeruli can be demonstrated at the single cell level, the authors assessed the size of mesangial cells in vitro before, during, and after exposure to the adrenergic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine. First passage mesangial cells approximately 4 weeks after explantation were studied by phase-contrast microscopy and recorded on time-lapse video recorder. The planar surface area of individual mesangial cells was measured by electronic planimeter from photographs of the video images. In response to norepinephrine (1 microM), the surface area decreased significantly on average, from 3.58 +/- 0.28 X 10(-6) sq mm to 3.38 +/- 0.27 (P less than 0.005). Washout of norepinephrine and replacement with hormone-free media in other cells led an increase in the surface area (from 2.47 +/- 0.43 X 10(-6) sq mm to 2.61 +/- 0.40, P less than 0.005). No changes were observed in cells initially bathed in hormone-free media. Thus, the morphologic equivalent of the adrenergic nerve-induced reduction in the ultrafiltration coefficient is a contraction of the glomerular corpuscle. By regulating the configuration of mesangial cells that anchor the glomerular capillary network to the vascular pole, the adrenergic nerve may concurrently determine the number of capillary channels available for filtration as well as the glomerular corpuscular volume.\r"

Therefore, the NC1 domain of collagen type IV in normal neonatal dog GBM was compared with NC1 in normal adult GBM by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using two anti-NC1 antibodies. Similar results were obtained, indicating that the NC1 domain is present and immunoreactive in the neonatal period. Next, serial renal biopsies were performed on a family of Samoyed dogs with hereditary glomerulopathy (SHG), an animal model of HN, and assessed by immunofluorescence. One of the anti-NC1 antibodies produced global staining of GBM in unaffected dogs, and global/segmental staining in carrier females; however, no staining was seen in affected males as early as the neonatal period. Electron microscopy (EM) failed to demonstrate any lesion of GBM in neonatal dogs. Thus, in SHG, and presumably in human HN, the abnormality in the NC1 domain is congenital, and precedes the changes seen by EM in GBM.\r"

Disruption in the paracellular barrier function of the tight junction has been proposed to allow reflux of bile into the blood. Cholestasis was induced in 210 to 235 g male Sprague-Dawley rats either by five consecutive daily subcutaneous injections of 17-alpha-ethinyl estradiol (0.5 mg/kg/d in propylene glycol) or ligation of the common bile duct for 72 hours. The structural organization of the tight junction was assessed in each model by indirect immunofluorescent and immunoperoxidase staining for ZO-1 on frozen sections of liver and compared with controls. In control, sham-operated, and estradiol-injected animals, ZO-1 localizes in a uniform continuous manner along the margins of the canaliculi. In contrast, bile duct ligation results in the appearance of numerous discontinuities in ZO-1 staining accompanied by dilation or collapse of the lumenal space. Tissue content of the ZO-1 protein, as determined by quantitative immunoblotting, was unaffected in either cholestatic model compared with controls. These findings indicate that the molecular organization of the tight junction can be assessed from immunostaining patterns of ZO-1 in frozen sections of cholestatic livers. Under these experimental conditions, the organization of the tight junction at the level of the ZO-1 protein is altered by bile duct obstruction but not by ethinyl estradiol.\r"

Individual Ki-67 values were considerably scattered in all histologically defined groups of malignancy. Thus, GF as determined by Ki-67 was used to calculate a modified prognostic index. In contrast to the histologically defined prognostic index, the Ki-67 based prognostic index allows further subdivision of thin malignant melanomas with no or few mitotic figures. This may be of help in identifying tumors with a high recurrence potential.\r"

  ".W": "Development of pancreatic hepatocytes in adult rats maintained on copper deficient diet containing 0.6% trien (CuDT) has been reported recently. To elucidate the histogenesis of hepatocytes a sequential study was undertaken using morphologic, histochemical, immunochemical, in situ hybridization, and Northern blot analysis. Male F-344 rats weighing 80 to 90 g were fed CuDT for 8 weeks and returned to normal rat chow. Beginning from 4 weeks of copper depletion, there was a progressive loss of acinar cells and by 8 weeks more than 90% of the acinar tissue was lost. During this period, there was an increase in the number of adipocytes in the interstitium, and in the number of interstitial and ductular cells. Morphologic observations were confirmed by immunoblot and Northern blot analysis, in which the amount of pancreatic proteins and their mRNAs decreased between 5 and 8 weeks. During this period, a progressive increase in the level of albumin mRNA was observed. In situ hybridization, performed at 7 weeks of copper deficiency, showed localization of albumin mRNA over interstitial and ductular cells. Pancreatic hepatocytes were identified immediately after the rats were returned to a normal diet and gradually increased in number. The hepatocytes occupied almost 60% of the pancreatic volume by 8 weeks. During the early recovery phase, hepatocytes were identified in ductules as well as in the interstitium. Based on these studies, it is concluded that both the ductular cells and interstitial cells, which resemble oval cells of liver, are capable of transforming into pancreatic hepatocytes and these cells may be considered stem-cell equivalent.\r"

This study used epitope-defined monoclonal antibodies to human tissue factor for immunohistochemical localization of TF in normal human tissues. TF was selectively expressed in tissues and was associated with cells rather than extracellular matrix. It was anatomically sequestered from blood, being undetectable in endothelium and peripheral blood cells. TF was present in vascular adventitia, organ capsules, epidermis, and mucosal epithelium. Most dermal and submucosal fibroblasts were negative. Except for alveolar macrophages and possibly dendritic cells of some lymphoid follicles, tissue macrophages did not express TF; (expression was demonstrable in LPS stimulated monocytes). Cerebral cortex, renal glomeruli, and cardiac myocytes were additional sites of prominent TF expression. Based on the cellular distribution of TF, it is hypothesized that intravascular initiation of coagulation requires induced expression by intravascular cells, and that the normal distribution of TF represents a hemostatic \"envelope\" ready to activate coagulation when vascular integrity is disrupted.\r"

Staining of the bile canaliculi localized enzymes, leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and Mg++-dependent ATPase (Mg++-ATPase), was examined by histochemistry in frozen sections. Mitochondrial membrane enzymes, including succinate dehydrogenase, also were examined by histochemistry. Staining of two monoclonal antibodies, C-1 and 9-B1, whose binding is localized in the bile canalicular region, was examined by immunofluorescence in frozen sections. Fasted rats treated with DCE developed moderate liver damage by 4 hours as evidenced by increases in serum transaminase and bilirubin, whereas fed rats developed only slight cell damage. Centrolobular loss of immunocytochemical and histochemical canalicular staining, especially for C-1 and Mg++-ATPase, was evident as early as 1 hour after DCE and was striking by 2 hours in both fed and fasted rats. Decreases in mitochondrial enzymes were not evident histochemically in fed animals at any time after DCE and were found only at the later times in fasted animals given the toxin. Thus, DCE administration to fed rats provides a new model system of selective bile canaliculi injury.\r"

This acute inflammatory reaction was short-lived and was replaced by a mild chronic synovitis as the number of detectable spirochetes in the synovium, periarticular soft tissues, and perineurovascular areas diminished. Exposing hamsters to radiation before inoculation with B. burgdorferi exacerbated and prolonged the acute inflammatory phase. Spirochetes also persisted longer in the periarticular soft tissues. A major histopathologic finding was destructive and erosive bone changes of the hind paws, which resulted in deformation of the joints. These studies should be helpful in defining the immune mechanism participating in the onset, progression, and resolution of Lyme arthritis.\r"

Isolated and cultured type II cells from neonatal and weanling rats that were inoculated with Sendai virus supported productive replication as indicated by ultrastructural identification of budding virions and viral nucleocapsids in type II cells and by demonstration of rising titers of infectious virus from inoculated type II cell cultures. Alveolar macrophages from neonatal and weanling rats also supported viral replication, although infectious viral titers in macrophage cultures were lower than those from type II cell cultures. Only minor differences were detected between viral titers from neonatal and weanling type II epithelial cell cultures. Higher densities of viral nucleocapsids were observed in neonatal type II cells than in those from weanling rats. The results indicate that isolated type II alveolar epithelial cells support productive replication of parainfluenza virus and that type II cells are probably more efficient in supporting productive viral replication than are alveolar macrophages.\r"

Lamellar bodies were isolated from control and ozone-exposed (3.0 ppm for 8 hours) adult male rats by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and analyzed for their content of six different lysosomal hydrolases. Immediately after 3 ppm ozone exposure (zero-time) there was a significant decrease in specific enzyme activity (units/mg protein) of five lamellar body hydrolases and these activities remained depressed for at least 24 hours after exposure. In addition, total enzyme activity (units/lung) was reduced at zero-time for beta-hexosaminidase and at 24 hours postexposure for alpha-mannosidase and alpha-L-fucosidase. During the reparative and recovery stages (48 to 96 hours) the hydrolases demonstrated variable elevations in both specific activity and total activity (units/lung). Characteristically, beta-hexosaminidase and beta-galactosidase reached supranormal values at 96 hours, whereas alpha-mannosidase remained below normal levels through the recovery stage. Moreover, at 24 to 48 hours the lamellar body fraction demonstrated prominent enzyme depletion relative to the expanding pool of stored surfactant. It is concluded that acute ozone stress initiates the development of hydrolase deficiency within the lamellar bodies of injured and regenerating type II cells. This deficiency state is followed by asynchronous lamellar body hydrolase elevations that reflect distinct patterns of response rather than uniform return to normal condition. The lysosomal enzyme changes of lamellar bodies may be pathogenetically linked to the development of associated alterations in the storage and secretion of surfactant.\r"

To determine the extent of pathology in this model, quantitation of light microscopic changes in hearts from 15 hypertensive-diabetic rats and 15 age-matched controls was performed. The fraction of myocardium involved by interstitial fibrosis, myocyte necrosis, replacement fibrosis, vascular sclerosis and perivascular fibrosis was computed separately for right and left ventricles. Spontaneously dying as well as deliberately killed hypertensive-diabetic rats were studied. Spontaneously dying animals had higher systolic blood pressures compared with rats killed deliberately. Body weights were lower and lung weights higher in the former group. Left and right ventricular necrosis and fibrosis were increased in spontaneously dying compared with deliberately killed rats. The degree of right ventricular necrosis and fibrosis paralleled that in the left ventricle, but was, unexpectedly, several times greater in magnitude. Thus, quantitative histology in the hypertensive-diabetic rat reveals more cardiac necrosis and fibrosis, in either ventricle, from spontaneously dying animals compared with deliberately killed rats. This damage, coupled with major functional alterations in the viable myocardium, may lead to congestive heart failure or arrhythmia.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the CD10 antigen, formerly designated as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen and recently identified as neutral endopeptidase, was examined immunohistochemically in 26 benign and in 55 malignant mesenchymal tumors. CD10 expression was found in 4 of 4 leiomyomas, 7 of 10 leiomyosarcomas, 1 of 6 rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 of 2 Triton tumors, 1 of 2 aggressive fibromatoses, 1 of 3 fibrosarcomas, 1 of 4 synovial sarcomas, 1 of 1 giant cell tumors of tendon sheath, 4 of 4 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 3 of 3 Ewing's sarcomas, and 2 of 3 osteosarcomas. Furthermore, CD10 was expressed consistently in the myoepithelial compartment of 12 fibroadenomas and, in 7 of these cases, in a minor stromal cell population, probably of (myo-) fibroblastic origin. Tumors of adipose tissue (4 lipomas, 5 liposarcomas), tumors of autonomic ganglia (2 ganglioneuromas, 1 ganglioneuroblastoma, 2 neuroblastomas), tumors of peripheral nerves with purely schwannian differentiation (7 malignant schwannomas), and tumors of disputed origin were consistently CD10-negative, however, as were single cases of fibroma and chondrosarcoma. These findings indicate that the expression of CD10 is a frequent but not obligatory feature in some mesenchymal tumors. Therefore CD10 is of value in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the tendency of myocardium to heal by scarring rather than regeneration, the authors examined the responses of connective tissue cells (CTCs) after three types of necrotizing injuries. Derived from myocardial interstitial cells, CTCs proliferated in both the connective tissue space and the compartment of necrotic myocytes. They assumed various cell forms: fibrocytelike CTCs throughout the sites of injury deposited extracellular scar tissue elements, established CTC-myocyte contacts, and helped anchor myocytes to scar tissue with myotendonlike specializations; CTCs with more complex forms established CTC-myocyte relationships, suggesting important roles in communication and tissue remodeling. CTCs within scar tissue differentiated into myofibrocytes, chondrocytes, and possibly smooth muscle cells. Most scar tissue elements were disposed in the long axis of myocytes. These alterations in form indicate that CTCs have various roles in myocardial repair and suggest that a number of the roles are modulated by contractile forces.\r"

Two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg were given 5 minutes apart. Neuromuscular recovery was assessed with train-of-four and tetanic stimuli. The first dose of neostigmine antagonised the neuromuscular blockade. The second dose diminished tetanic height and increased tetanic fade. The train-of-four measured mechanically was adversely affected to a small degree, but when measured with the electromyograph no significant change occurred. Neostigmine may adversely affect neuromuscular function after spontaneous recovery from a non-depolarising block. This is unlikely with a single modest dose and any effects are probably short-lived.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was carried out in which a chest radiograph was performed routinely on the third postoperative day on 35 consecutive patients who had elective abdominal surgery. The aim was to determine whether clinical symptoms and signs could be correlated with the radiographic appearances and whether the routine use of such an X ray could detect serious chest pathology before clinical signs developed. Thirteen patients (37%) had radiological evidence of complications and all had symptoms and (or) signs which suggested postoperative chest pathology. The 22 patients (63%) who had no radiological abnormality, could be subdivided clinically into those who were normal (29%) and those who had symptoms and (or) signs (34%). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of previous surgery, sex, smoking, nature of surgical incision, age or duration of anaesthesia. There was a poor correlation between the diagnosis of the chest abnormality detected clinically and the diagnosis suggested by the radiographs. These findings suggest that a routine postoperative chest X ray is unnecessary in the absence of clinically detectable chest pathology.\r"

The clinical signs and symptoms of spinal arachnoiditis were severe and in every case the diagnosis was confirmed by myelography. Three patients were confined to a wheelchair after 3 years of follow-up. To our knowledge, the anaesthetic procedures were performed according to standard methods. Arachnoiditis seems to be due to the epidural injection of foreign substances, and may be related to anaesthetic-vasoconstrictor solution or contaminants.\r"

The pressure-flow relationship was curvilinear in all cases. Robertshaw and Carlens' tubes were generally found to have bronchial and tracheal channels with almost similar resistance and offered total resistances similar to those of 7.0-8.0 mm internal diameter tracheal tubes. The new device had a higher resistance than others of equal external diameter. This must be taken into account when its use is recommended for prolonged respiratory support.\r"

Each rat received one of six different concentrations of N2O, and enflurane was adjusted to attain 1.0 MAC with the use of a standard tail clamp method. The resultant group MAC anesthetic concentrations were Group I-N2O = 0.0%, enflurane = 2.30%; Group II-N2O = 10.4%, enflurane = 2.19%; Group III-N2O = 30.7%, enflurane = 1.85%; Group IV-N2O = 61.8%, enflurane = 1.75%; Group V-N2O = 70.9%, enflurane = 1.56%; and Group VI-N2O = 80.3%, enflurane = 1.54%. Increasing the N2O concentration from 0-10%, from 30-60%, or 70-80% did not significantly decrease the enflurane requirement; however, increasing the N2O concentration from 10-30% or 60-70% produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in the concentration of enflurane required for 1.0 MAC of anesthesia. Thus, in rats, increasing the concentration of N2O in sub-MAC ranges did not produce a linear decrease in the enflurane concentration required to add up to 1.0 MAC of anesthesia. These results are consistent with a dose-dependent interaction between N2O and the excitatory properties of enflurane; this interaction could represent synergism at low concentrations or antagonism at higher concentration of N2O.\r"

  ".W": "Phenylephrine (Phe) is frequently administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus to increase blood pressure, yet the acute time course and hemodynamic effects of bolus Phe in patients with myocardial disease have not been reported. Therefore 50 randomized IV bolus doses of Phe (50, 100, 150, or 200 micrograms) were given to 18 patients during anesthesia for elective coronary artery surgery. Esophageal Doppler techniques were used to continuously monitor cardiac output (CO); mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, and calculated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were recorded every 5 seconds for a total of 2 minutes. The hemodynamic changes (mean +/- SEM) for each of the four doses of Phe (50, 100, 150, 200 micrograms) were maximal at about 42 seconds after the drug was given. They consisted of an increase in MAP (11.6 +/- 2.1, 15.6 +/- 2.4, 14.7 +/- 2.4, 18.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg); increase in SVR (766 +/- 190, 930 +/- 310, 950 +/- 344, 1732 +/- 824 dynes.sec.cm-5); and a decrease in CO (-.58 +/- .11, -.68 +/- .13, -.73 +/- .20, -.77 +/- .18 L.min-1). Hypertension, increased age, low preoperative ejection fraction, high baseline CO, and low baseline SVR significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased hemodynamic responses to Phe (see text). In conclusion, bolus IV Phe in patients with myocardial disease increases MAP and SVR and simultaneously decreases CO; these peak hemodynamic events occur approximately 42 seconds after Phe administration.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the anesthetic potency of organic compounds increases as a given halogen is replaced with successively larger halogens. These studies often are limited in the accuracy of determination of potency, rarely correlate potency with physical properties, and usually fail to include ether compounds. Because establishing relationships between structure and activity may shed light on anesthetic action, we studied the new anesthetic, I-537 (CHF2-O-CHBr-CF3), relative to two other ether anesthetics, I-653 (CHF2-O-CHF-CF3) and isoflurane (CHF2-O-CHCl-CF3) for both of which MAC and oil/gas partition coefficients are accurately known. The oil/gas partition coefficient of I-537 at 37 degrees C was found to be 245 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) and the MAC in Sprague-Dawley rats 0.52 +/- 0.07%. Increasing atomic weight of the 1-ethyl halogen (i.e., F in I-653, Cl in isoflurane, and Br in I-537) progressively decreases MAC (increases potency) and increases lipid solubility. Although potency and solubility change by more than 10-fold, the product of MAC and the oil/gas partition coefficient remains essentially constant (120 +/- 11). However, this product is significantly less than that for other inhaled anesthetics, a finding which either challenges the unitary theory of narcosis or suggests that the lipid solvent classically used to model the site of anesthetic action (olive oil) is inappropriate.\r"

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was performed 60 seconds after induction. The elderly had significantly less chronotropic response to intubation 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes after induction so that the maximum increase in heart rate above awake values was negatively correlated with age (R = -0.66, P less than 0.001). Baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean BP increased significantly with age (R = 0.81, P less than 0.001 and R = 0.76, P less than 0.001, respectively) but age was not significantly related to increases in SBP and mean BP following intubation. Baseline plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels increased with age ( R = 0.51, P less than 0.01). Following intubation, mean plasma NE concentrations were significantly higher in elderly patients than young patients, despite the diminished heart rate response. Heart rate (HR) per pg/ml of NE, a measure of cardiac sensitivity to beta stimulation, was therefore significantly less 2, 3, and 4 mins after induction in elderly patients than in younger patients. To determine if this alteration in cardiac sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines was reflected by changes in beta receptor function on lymphocytes, beta receptor density and the proportion of receptor binding agonist with high affinity (%RH) were measured. No significant correlation between beta-receptor affinity for agonist, %RH, or receptor density was found with age, HR, or HR per pg/ml NE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients (10 in each group) had good or excellent intubating conditions at 80% depression of twitch height [T1 of train-of-four (TOF) stimulation]. Mean times to intubation were 2.6 +/- 0.2 minutes following 0.25 mg/kg and 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes following 0.3 mg/kg. These times were significantly longer (P less than 0.05) than the mean intubation time of 1.5 +/- 0.2 minutes following 0.4 mg/kg. Mean times to recovery, defined as times from injection of atracurium to return of T1 of TOF to 10%, 25%, and 95% of control measurements, were significantly shorter with the smaller doses. Atracurium at these low doses may provide an alternative to succinylcholine for intubating children during halothane anesthesia for surgical procedures lasting 20-30 min.\r"

Mental function was assessed by Mini-Mental State (MMS) preoperatively and at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. Preoperatively, 18.7% of the elderly had cognitive impairment of mental function while none in the younger group had any impairment (P less than 0.02). At six hours postoperatively, 29.7% of the elderly had cognitive impairment compared with 4% of the younger group (P less than 0.01). At 24 hours postoperatively, the percentage of elderly and younger patients with cognitive impairment had returned to preoperative levels. Baseline score and age were found to be significant predictors (P less than 0.004) of the 6-hour score and 24-hour score. In conclusion, cognitive impairment of mental function occurred in patients undergoing cataract operation with retrobulbar block and intravenous sedation at 6 hours postoperatively; MMS has the potential for use as a screening preoperative test for outpatients to identify those at risk for developing cognitive impairment.\r"

Sensory blockade (SB) was evaluated by pinprick and motor blockade (MB) according to Bromage's scale. The level of SB was comparable in the three groups but the duration was different. The 75 micrograms clonidine was associated with 25% prolongation of SB at L2 and 29% prolongation of grade 3 MB Clonidine 150 micrograms prolonged the time of SB at L2 by 72% and grade 3 MB by 96%. Colloid infusion and the decrease in diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in the clonidine 150 micrograms group compared to group I. A dose related prolongation of spinal anesthesia is demonstrated with clonidine.\r"

However, significant impairment of hind leg motor function ranging from unbalanced gait to paralysis was observed following the first SST i.t. injection. Histological examination of spinal cords six days after the first SST injection in group II showed multiple pyknotic neurons in all cats. Some cats showed focal demyelination in the posterior column of the spinal cord white matter. Mice received a single percutaneous injection of 50 micrograms SST i.t. (group I, N = 7), 5 micrograms SST i.t. (group II, N = 3), or saline i.t., (group III, N = 5). No analgesic effects were observed in groups II and III as evaluated by the hot plate (HP) and tail flick (TF) tests. Injection of 50 micrograms SST i.t. (group I) caused reversible flaccid hind leg paralysis in all mice and concomitant increases in HP and TF latencies. Histologic examination revealed focal demyelination in the spinal cord in three out of seven mice in this group. Present data substantiate neurotoxic effects of i.t. SST and lack of behaviorally defined antinociception at innocuous dosages.\r"

  ".W": "It has been claimed that tourniquet cycling, cyclic deflation and reinflation of the tourniquet at the termination of intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA), enhances the safety of IVRA by minimizing the peak blood level of local anesthetics. To evaluate the validity of these claims and to determine the optimal cycling technic, peak arterial (Cmax) plasma concentrations of lidocaine were determined as well as the time to reach these peaks (Tmax) utilizing contralateral radial arterial blood samples in three groups of volunteers after 30 minutes of IVRA: In all three groups IVRA was induced with 3 mg/kg of lidocaine and maintained for 30 min. In the first group the tourniquet was then simply deflated once (and not reinflated); in the second group the tourniquet was deflated three times with variable periods of deflation (0, 10 and 30 seconds) separated by 1-minute periods of reinflation; and in the third group the tourniquet was again deflated 3 times but with fixed periods of deflation (10 sec) separated by 1 min periods of reinflation. The results obtained indicate that cycling technics do not appear to significantly reduce Cmax, but they do significantly prolong Tmax. Of the two cycling technics, the 10-second deflation interval technic appeared to be superior, both clinically and pharmacologically, as it was associated with less venous congestion and therefore less discomfort, and it sequentially decreased the arterial plasma concentration of lidocaine with each subsequent deflation-reinflation cycle.\r"

  ".W": "The unusually wide, 80-fold species variation observed by others (1,2) in the neuromuscular (NM) potency of diadonium, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant (MR), between cat and man suggested that the site and mechanism of its NM effect may vary in different species. To obtain information on this question, the NM potency of diadonium and the reversibility of its NM effect by neostigmine and/or 4-aminopyridine (4AP) was investigated on the in vitro phrenic nerve--hemidiaphragm preparations of rats, mice and guinea pigs. The concentration of diadonium that caused 90% NM block (IC90) was much greater in guinea pigs, 1.74 +/- 0.02 and 1.28 +/- 0.01 mu, when the preparations were stimulated with single stimuli at 0.1 Hz or with 0.1 s trains of 50 Hz tetani every 10 s, respectively, than in rats (IC90 = 62.4 +/- 0.89 and 52.1 +/- 1.00 microM) or mice (IC90 = 51.9 +/- 0.98 and 44.4 +/- 0.22 microM). In guinea pigs, the NM blocking effect of diadonium could be antagonized by neostigmine. This indicates that in this species the NM blocking effect of diadonium is primarily caused by inhibition of the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh), released by the nerve impulse, with the cholinergic receptors (cholinoceptors) of the postjunctional membrane (p.j.m.). By contrast, in rats and mice diadonium was not antagonized by neostigmine but was reversed by 4-aminopyridine. This suggests that in these species, in contrast to other nondepolarizing MR, diadonium does not inhibit NM transmission postsynaptically, but by inhibiting the positive nicotinic feedback mechanism of mobilization of ACh from reserve depots to release sites, causes a presynaptic NM block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A biphasic, charge balanced waveform with a first phase duration of 2 msec, current 10 microA and repetition rate 10 Hz was found to induce maximum tail flick latency changes. The effects of morning or nighttime stimulation were statistically indistinguishable, as were the differences between monophasic and biphasic stimulation. Analgesia was maximized when a positive first phase was delivered into the right ears of the rats, but monolateral stimulation with both electrodes on either the left or the right ear produced no measurable effect. Examination of TE responses in sham and stimulated populations reveals normal response distributions with the stimulated group skewed toward a positive effect.\r"

  ".W": "While monitoring the thenar EMG response to ulnar nerve stimulation, the authors gave either 105, 150, 210, or 300 micrograms/kg of atracurium to 60 patients. The maximal neuromuscular responses were plotted on a log-probit paper. The individual second dose required to produce 95% neuromuscular block (NMB) was estimated from a graph drawn on the paper. The maximal response following this second dose was then plotted. The mean maximal response following the second atracurium dose was 95.5% (SD range, 92.6-97.4%) NMB. The two dose-response points thus acquired resulted in the individual two-dose dose-response curve. The ED50 and ED95 and slope of the two-dose dose-response curve were compared with the single-dose dose-response curve. The average ED50 and ED95 determined by the two-dose and the single-dose techniques were nearly identical [160 micrograms/kg (SD range, 126-201 micrograms/kg) vs. 164 micrograms/kg (SD range, 150-179 micrograms/kg) and 302 micrograms/kg (SD range, 251-363 micrograms/kg) vs. 336 micrograms/kg (SD range, 274-411 micrograms/kg) respectively]. Also, the slopes of the curves were similar [6.2 (SD range, 5.2-7.2) vs. 5.4 (SD range, 4.5-6.4) probit/log]. It is therefore possible to construct an individual dose-response curve for atracurium within 7-9 min and to determine individual pharmacodynamic characteristics of atracurium from this curve.\r"

  ".W": "Noninvasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing (NTP) is a rapid, safe, and easily utilized form of emergency cardiac pacing, with hemodynamics similar to right ventricular endocardial pacing. Although the technique has proven effective for hemodynamically significant bradycardias and early use during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, NTP under anesthetic conditions has been poorly characterized. In particular, it is unknown to what degree the multiple physiologic perturbations of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) affect myocardial thresholds and the efficacy of the unit itself. Patients undergoing procedures utilizing CPB (n = 23) were studied in an effort to address these issues. All patients were able to be paced at all points throughout the 24-h study interval, although four patients developed hemodynamic instability during this period causing their exclusion from additional investigation. Only one patient requested discontinuation from the study due to discomfort. A statistically significant increase in mean current requirements for capture was demonstrated over time (P less than 0.0001), with baseline thresholds being significantly less than other study points (P less than or equal to 0.05). Thresholds following chest wall closure were significantly greater than all other study points (P less than or equal to 0.05), possibly due to accumulation of pericardial and mediastinal air. Multiple measured variables changed significantly during the study, but only increases in cardiac output and core temperature were related to statistically significant increases in current thresholds (P less than or equal to 0.05). Increasing age and pump time were of borderline importance. NTP represents an effective pacing alternative in cardiac surgical patients.\r"

To evaluate the role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in this phenomenon, the disposition and effect of atracurium (0.5 mg/kg iv) were studied in thermally injured patients (5 males, 16-43 yr) in comparison with that in nonburned control patients (3 males, 1 female, 24-53 yr). The decline of plasma atracurium concentration with time was biexponential in both groups of patients. There were no significant differences in the mean value of any pharmacokinetic parameter (clearance, V1, V beta, alpha and beta half-lives). The time course of effect was also similar, although the maximum twitch depression was significantly smaller (66.1% vs. 100% maximal twitch depression) and time to recover to 50% of maximal twitch depression was significantly shorter (14.2 vs. 52 min) in thermally injured patients. Patients with thermal injury had an EC50 (plasma concentration of atracurium required for 50% of the maximum possible response) 3.4 times that of control patients. Plasma-free fraction of atracurium in the thermally injured patients was 75% that in controls, and free EC50 (the product of free fraction and EC50) of the thermally injured group was 2.7 times that of controls. The results of this study confirm a pharmacodynamic mechanism for the majority of resistance to atracurium, with a diminished free fraction in plasma also contributing to this effect.\r"

  ".W": "Certain opioids release histamine from cutaneous mast cells to produce local wheal and flare responses and adverse hemodynamic effects. In vivo responses to opioids suggest that cutaneous responses result from the interaction of opioids with opioid receptors on human mast cells. There are no data evaluating or comparing the opioids currently used in anesthesia. Volunteers were injected intradermally with different opioids as well as with naloxone and antihistamines to evaluate their effects on cutaneous mast cell reactivity and cutaneous vascular responses. Fentanyl and morphine produced concentration-dependent wheal and flare responses in the range of 5 X 10(-6) M to 1.5 X 10(-3) M. Volunteers were then tested intradermally with different opioids and histamine at a 5 X 10(-4) M concentration to determine their relative cutaneous effects. Morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, and sufentanil produced both wheal and flare responses that were significantly greater than those due to saline (P less than 0.05). Naloxone, alfentanil, and nalbuphine did not produce significant wheal or flare responses. Butorphenol was followed by a significant wheal but no flare. Naloxone attentuated cutaneous wheal and flare responses to fentanyl and the flare response to morphine. Intradermal antihistamines (diphenhydramine and cimetidine) produced significant wheal and flare responses. Electron micrographs of biopsies from fentanyl-induced wheals demonstrated normal mast cell architecture with no evidence of mast cell degranulation. Opioid effects on wheal and flare responses and mast cell degranulation appear independent of opioid analgesic potency. Opioids produce cutaneous vascular responses dependent on both histamine release from mast cells and direct effects on the vasculature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure requires six injections of local anesthetic and application of a stereotactic frame by fixation into the outer table of the skull, and has been used during the past 20 yr to treat over 1,000 patients with cerebral AVMs. No effort was made to control blood pressure. Blood pressure increased during administration of the local anesthetic and application of the frame. Maximum systolic and mean arterial pressures averaged 160 +/- 17 and 118 +/- 7 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. This represented an average increase of 44 mmHg (38%) in systolic pressure and 32 mmHg (37%) in mean blood pressure at some point during the procedure (P less than 0.01 compared with pretreatment control pressures). Systolic pressure increased more than 60 mmHg in 21% of patients. Nevertheless, none of these 56 patients nor any of the more than 1,000 patients treated in similar fashion suffered a clinically evident AVM hemorrhage during the procedure. Since the treatment protocol has not changed materially during the past 20 yr, the authors assume that most patients treated in this fashion developed a similar degree of hypertension and conclude from this large clinical experience that moderate arterial hypertension does not precipitate spontaneous hemorrhage of intracranial AVMs.\r"

Moderate and severe ischemia were produced by right carotid artery occlusion combined with hemorrhagic hypotension (moderate ischemia, MAP = 30 mmHg, FIO2 = 0.30; severe ischemia, MAP = 25 mmHg, FIO2 = 0.20). Neurologic outcome was evaluated using a graded deficit score from 0 to 5 (0 = normal, 5 = death associated with stroke), and neurohistopathology was evaluated using a 40-point scale from 0 = normal to 40 = total hemisphere infarct at the level of the caudate nucleus in coronal section. Compared with N2O alone, isoflurane (0.5 and 1 MAC) improved neurologic outcome following moderate ischemia (P less than 0.05). Isoflurane also decreased histopathologic damage following moderate ischemia (N2O control = 33 +/- 1 vs. 0.5 MAC isoflurane = 11 +/- 4 and 1 MAC isoflurane = 12 +/- 3, P less than 0.05), whereas only 0.5 MAC isoflurane decreased histopathologic damage following severe ischemia (N2O control = 38 +/- 1 vs. 0.5 MAC isoflurane = 25 +/- 5; P less than 0.05) Adding N2O to 0.5 MAC isoflurane attenuated the neurologic protective effect of isoflurane alone and increased histopathologic damage following both moderate and severe ischemia (moderate = 23 +/- 5, severe = 37 +/- 2; both P greater than 0.05 compared with N2O controls).

The inhalational anesthetics, halothane, nitrous oxide, and cyclopropane, markedly enhance t-bu-OOH-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and thromboxane production. The effects of the intravenous (iv) barbiturates thiopental and pentobarbital on t-bu-OOH-induced vasoconstriction were studied. Thiopental completely and pentobarbital partially blocked t-bu-OOH-induced vasoconstriction. Thiopental inhibited t-bu-OOH-induced synthesis of thromboxane and prostacyclin but pentobarbital did not. This inhibitory action of thiopental may be due to its antioxidant properties because similar inhibition has been observed of t-bu-OOH-induced thromboxane production with the antioxidants, vitamin E, or butylated hydroxylanisole. Thiopental and pentobarbital also inhibited the vasoconstriction induced by a thromboxane analog, epoxymethano prostaglandin H2 (U46619). Finally, both barbiturates partially inhibited the pulmonary vasoconstriction caused by potassium chloride, which requires calcium entry, but they did not inhibit the constriction caused by angiotensin II, which does not require calcium entry. These results suggest that pentobarbital and thiopental may block pulmonary vasoconstriction by inhibiting calcium entry.\r"

This involved the measurement of the minimum current (50 Hz 2 ms pulses 0-5 mA), which made the rat squeak when applied alternately to electrodes at each skin site. The responses measured in milliamperes were expressed as a number of times control readings. Equieffective doses of both midazolam and fentanyl produced a significant increase in electrical threshold for pain in the tail (mean +/- SEM 3.14 +/- 0.51 and 2.89 +/- 0.35: P less than 0.05; Wilcoxon sum rank test) in the absence of any change in the neck (mean +/- SEM 1.28 +/- 0.13 and 0.96 +/- 0.12, NS), thus demonstrating a spinal effect. Fentanyl caused a significant simultaneous increase in tail flick latency (mean +/- SEM 67.8 +/- 20.1%, P less than 0.05), but midazolam did not (mean +/- SEM 4.22 +/- 2.76%, NS). Intraperitoneal injections of naloxone (0.25 mg/kg) blocked the response to fentanyl in both tests and did not affect the response to midazolam. Intraperitoneal flumazenil (5 mg/kg) blocked the midazolam antinociceptive effect but did not affect the response to fentanyl in either test. Tail withdrawal in response to non-noxious stimulation was preserved in all animals with spinal analgesia, indicating that myelinated afferent and efferent pathways were still functioning. Righting reflex, coordination, motor power, and alertness were also preserved in the presence of both drugs. Both drugs caused spinally mediated antinociceptive effects that were qualitatively different.\r"

Anesthesia was induced with enflurane and N2O prior to tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Physiologic variables (temperature, blood pressure, pH, PaO2, PaCO2, serum glucose, and hematocrit) were maintained within normal limits. Each rat was randomly assigned one of the following 1.2 MAC anesthetic regimens: 1) control--0% N2O/2.76% enflurane, 2) treatment 1--30% N2O/2.26% enflurane, or 3) treatment II--60% N2O/2.12% enflurane. Following anesthetic equilibration, an autoradiographic evaluation of local cerebral and spinal cord glucose utilization was performed. There were no differences in the physiologic data. As enflurane was partially replaced by an equivalent MAC fraction of N2O (0-30%), a heterogeneous activation of cerebral metabolism was observed in selected sensory input structures, and in components of the limbic system. The values tended to return to control when N2O was increased to 60% (and the enflurane was appropriately reduced). At all spinal cord levels, a homogeneous increase in metabolism was observed in both white and grey matter when enflurane was replaced by the 0-30% N2O change, with a return to control when the N2O was further increased from 30-60%. Thus, in rats, increasing the N2O concentration (while concurrently decreasing enflurane) produced a biphasic metabolic response. Metabolism was activated when N2O was increased from 0-30%, with a relative depression in metabolism when N2O was further increased from 30-60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio of fatal anesthetic concentration-to-MAC for I-653 (2.45 +/- 0.11) was less than that determined for isoflurane (3.02 +/- 0.13; P less than 0.01) but relatively greater than that reported previously for other inhaled anesthetics. As with other inhaled anesthetics, the concentration of I-653 causing cardiovascular collapse exceeds that producing apnea, making cardiovascular collapse during spontaneous ventilation unlikely. Mean aortic blood pressure and cardiac output decreased as linear functions of anesthetic concentration. Values for these variables for isoflurane were greater than those for I-653 at concentrations exceeding 1.5 MAC. Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and base-deficit did not change with anesthetic depth. Mixed venous PO2, mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation, and the ratio of oxygen transport to oxygen consumption remained at or above values in conscious swine but decreased similarly with both anesthetics when anesthetic concentration increased to within 0.5 MAC of the fatal concentration. Thus, the latter three variables, reflecting the fraction of delivered oxygen that is consumed, and \"mean\" tissue PO2 appear to be useful indices of anesthetic concentrations approaching those producing cardiovascular collapse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of the combination of relatively low concentrations of bupivacaine and mild hypothermia are unknown and are the subject of this study. Three groups (n = 10-12) of dogs anesthetized with thiopental-chloralose were treated as follows: group 1, bupivacaine + hypothermia; group 2, bupivacaine alone; group 3, hypothermia alone. Bupivacaine was administered as a 4 mg/kg iv bolus followed by an iv infusion of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1. Hypothermia, i.e., a 4 degrees C reduction in core temperature, was produced by cooling the blood with an extracorporeal circuit. The peripheral ECG was recorded to determine the duration of QRS complexes and the QT interval. Conduction time and effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular contractile tissue were measured with right ventricular endocavitary electrodes. Measurements were made with the heart paced at 180 beats/min and without pacing. In group 1 dogs, bupivacaine (plasma level, 2.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml) initially caused a prolongation of conduction time and QRS duration, which were further lengthened (approximately doubled) by a temperature decrease of 4 degrees C from baseline. The QT interval and ERP also were increased but to a lesser degree. In dogs in which the effects were most pronounced, rhythm disorders, such as wave burst arrhythmias (most common), premature systoles, ventricular tachycardia, and even ventricular fibrillation, occurred either spontaneously or during pacing. Bupivacaine alone (group 2) increased QRS duration and conduction time significantly, whereas hypothermia alone (Group 3) did not cause changes in any conduction variables. In neither group were dysrhythmias observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radioactivity remaining in the spinal cord 2, 4, 6, and 12 h later revealed recovery (mean +/- SEM) of 45 +/- 5.6% (n = 3), 30.5 +/- 14.1% (n = 4), 11.23 +/- 4.4% (n = 3), and 3.7 +/- 1.1% (n = 3), respectively, of the injected radioactivity. Tritiated morphine was found to be predominantly centered around the injection site, with limited rostral and caudal spread in the cord. No significant radioactivity was detected in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the cisterna magna taken at 5, 15, 30, min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after receiving radioactive labeled drug (with the exception of that in one rabbit). Of the injected radioactivity, 75% was recovered in the urine in 12 h. These results suggest that the persistence of morphine in the spinal cord could account for its prolonged analgesic effect following intrathecal administration.\r"

  ".W": "The pulmonary artery responses in the isolated whole-blood perfused canine lung to ionized calcium ([Ca++]) were quantified over a range of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia values ([Ca++] = 0.23-1.88 mM) under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant mean aortic and left atrial pressures. Calcium chloride, administered as bolus doses in the clinical range (5-15 mg.kg-1) at initial normocalcemia and without interventions producing vasoconstriction did not influence mean pulmonary artery pressure at constant pulmonary blood flow. Stable hypercalcemia ([Ca++] = 1.88 +/- 0.05 mM) did not influence the slope of the pulmonary artery pressure-flow plot. Because normal pulmonary vasomotor tone is low and cannot readily be lowered further, the possible vasodilator action of hypocalcemia was assessed by its ability to decrease the slope of the mean pulmonary artery pressure-flow plot, which had been first increased by alveolar hypoxia (AHX) or infusion of the prostaglandin endoperoxide analog U46619 (PG). During AHX (n = 5), a graded reduction from normocalcemia ([Ca++] = 1.08 +/- 0.02 mM) to moderate hypocalcemia ([Ca++] = 0.8 and 0.5 mM) did not alter the pulmonary artery pressure-flow plot, but severe hypocalcemia ([Ca++] = 0.26 +/- 0.01 mM) decreased the slope by 13 +/- 0.9 mmHg.l-1.min-1. The comparison of severe hypocalcemia ([Ca++] = 0.23-0.27 mM) versus a high dose of nifedipine (bolus of 10 micrograms/kg followed by continuous infusion at 40 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) on pulmonary vascular tone increased by either AHX or PG infusion indicated that both hypocalcemia and nifedipine decreased the slope of the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure and flow (during AHX: -16.1 +/- 1.38 and -23.3 +/- 1.73 mmHg.l-1.min-1, both P = 0.0001 vs. AHX alone, and during PG: -17.05 +/- 1.95 and -8.4 +/- 1.78 mmHg.l-1.min-1, P = 0.0001 vs. PG alone). Two principal conclusions emerge. First, the pulmonary vessels are minimally sensitive to changes in ionized calcium throughout the clinical hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia ranges; extreme hypocalcemia is required to produce vasodilation, which was reversed with calcium infusion. Second, whereas the pulmonary vasodilator effects of extreme hypocalcemia were independent of the intervention inducing pulmonary vasoconstriction (AHX vs. PG), those of nifedipine were much more pronounced with AHX.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbit right ventricular papillary muscles were tetanized by rapid stimulation in the presence of 1 microM ryanodine, an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticular function. Tetanic contractions elicited in this manner increased in strength as extracellular calcium concentration [Ca+2]ext was raised from 0.5 to 5 mM, exhibited saturation behavior above [Ca+2]ext = 5 mM, and were blocked by nifedipine. Accompanying membrane potentials depolarized to +10 mV and repolarized to -60 mV between stimuli. These data suggest that rabbit myocardial tetany is supported in large part by extracellular calcium influx via slow (L-type) calcium channels, consistent with similar recent findings in the ferret. At [Ca+2]ext = 2.5 mM, isoflurane (0.6-2.3%, gas phase) and halothane (0.4-1.5%) inhibited the strength of tetanic contractions in dose-dependent fashion. At [Ca+2]ext = 20 mM neither isoflurane (1.2%) nor halothane (0.8%) inhibited tetanic contraction strength. These data demonstrate that isoflurane and halothane inhibit contractile activity that is dependent on transsarcolemmal calcium influx via pathways independent of the ryanodine-sensitive sarcoplasmic reticulum. The exact sites of inhibition (e.g., slow channel vs. intracellular transit vs. myofibrillar binding) are not identified, but inhibition by either anesthetic may be competitively reversed by high extracellular calcium concentrations.\r"

  ".U": "89245312\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms of persistent differential blocks that accompany subarachnoid and epidural anesthesia are clarified here with the aid of two principles derived from in vitro study of individual myelinated axons: 1) conduction can leap two consecutive blocked nodes but not three, and 2) a fiber length with more than three consecutive nodes bathed by weak anesthetic may block by decremental conduction, the requisite concentration varying inversely with the number of nodes bathed by anesthetic. Principle 1 applies in epidural blockade, where anesthetic bathes only a few millimeters of segmental nerve extradurally in the intervertebral foramen. Here, three-node block will be rare in large, long-internode fibers but likely in small, short internode fibers, thus explaining the differential retention of motor power in the presence of block of pain, which is achieved in epidural anesthesia when relatively weak solutions are used, as in obstetrics. Principle 2 may intervene in subarachnoid blockade where, cephalad to the site of puncture, increasingly concentrated anesthetic bathes increasing lengths of fibers in the craniocaudal succession of spinal nerve roots. This will produce decremental conduction block in increasingly long internode fibers in successive roots, reflected in a corresponding craniocaudal segmental sequence of blocked physiological functions: vasoconstriction, cutaneous temperature discrimination, pinprick pain sensibility, and skeletal motor activity. The segmental spatial differential sequence migrates with time but resembles the temporal differential sequence of loss seen at the onset of peripheral nerve blocks. Several other previously disparate clinical observations follow logically from the new interpretation.\r"

In our study we determined if different aspirating techniques or different ampule types had any effect on glass particle contamination. In part 1 of this study different aspiration techniques were evaluated. The four groups included a control group of 3 mm tubing, an 18-g 1.5-inch needle, a filter needle, and an in-line filter. A significant reduction in glass particle contamination was found when using either an in-line filter or a filter needle compared with the control group or when aspirating through an 18-g needle. The average number of glass particles found per ampule for each group was 100.6 +/- 16.3, 65.6 +/- 18.7, 1.3 +/- 0.3, and 1.2 +/- 0.3, respectively, for the control group, 18-g needle, filter needle, and in-line filter. In part 2 we examined four types of glass ampules: transparent metal etched, transparent chemically etched, amber metal etched, and amber chemically etched. There was a significantly greater number of glass particles found in the transparent metal etched ampules compared with that found in the other three ampule types. Transparent metal etched ampules yielded an average total number of particles per ampule of 45.9 +/- 15.4 compared with 3.2 +/- 0.9, 6.0 +/- 1.7, and 3.1 +/- 0.6, in the transparent chemically etched, amber metal etched, and amber chemically etched ampule types, respectively. This study demonstrates that using drugs supplied in ampules other than transparent metal etched type and by using filters will decrease the risk of parenteral injection of glass particles.\r"

When thallium 201 (201TI) is injected intravenously (IV), only about 5% reaches the myocardium. However, if 201TI is injected intracoronarily, 100% reaches, and approximately 88% localizes in, the myocardium, which results in higher count rates than when given IV, permitting acceptable acquisition times for gated true wall motion studies. The authors describe a new technique using intracoronary (IC) 201TI to acquire high count rate, high contrast, and short acquisition time in gated true wall motion studies. Thirteen patients were studied at rest with gated IC thallium. Six of these patients also had resting IV 201TI myocardial studies. After routine coronary angiography, 0.75 mCi of 201TI was injected into each coronary artery. Multiple sequential one-minute gated studies were obtained in LAO and RAO projections, followed by sequential five-minute images for two hours to determine 201TI redistribution kinetics. Regions of interest over segments of left and right ventricles and background permitted definition of temporal and spatial distributions. Three one-minute gated studies were summed with a total count of 2,100 K for a three-minute acquisition. Myocardium-to-background ratios were as high as 13:1 with a mean of 11.4:1 in the IC study compared with 2.3:1 in the IV studies. Washout half-time in normal myocardium was 95 +/- 5 min. The detectability and size of perfusion defects were different on gated diastolic and systolic, nongated, and IV studies. Questionable defects seen on nongated studies or after IV administration were easily noted on gated diastolic images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant changes were observed in heart rates and arterial pressure during and after vibration load. These findings suggest that increased myocardial blood flows in response to vibration may be related more to the frequency of vibration than to beta-adrenergic actions.\r"

The flow properties of blood are of special interest in arteriosclerotic diseases for vasoregulatory mechanisms are often disturbed in these states. The authors compared the rheologic properties of blood in patients with arteriosclerotic lesions (coronary heart disease: n = 56; cerebrovascular disease: n = 37; peripheral arterial occlusive disease: n = 29 and healthy controls: n = 42). With a new oscillating capillary rheometer imitating the physiologic pulsations of blood flow in an unbranched artery, the viscosity (eta') and elasticity (eta\") of whole blood and plasma were measured (diameter of the capillary: 0.9928 mm; pulse rate: 2/s; shear rate: gamma = 0.03-200/s; temperature: 37 degrees C). In arteriosclerotic patients a statistically significant elevation of the viscoelasticity of whole blood and plasma was found. In addition, plasma fibrinogen levels were augmented in the patients' groups. Clotting parameters (Quick, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count) and total serum protein levels were in the normal range in all patients investigated. In conclusion the question arises whether the increase of blood viscoelasticity is an additional risk factor for patients with arteriosclerotic disease or if it is just a consequence of the underlying disease. The authors' observations concerning blood viscoelasticity support the clinical importance of improving blood rheology by appropriate therapeutic measures.\r"

  ".W": "Blackfoot disease is an endemic peripheral vascular disease found among the inhabitants of a limited area on the southwest coast of Taiwan, where artesian well water with a high concentration of arsenic has been used for more than eighty years. The natural history of blackfoot disease, based on a prospective study of 1,300 patients, is presented. The overall male/female ratio was 1.5:1. Although the clinical onset was usually insidious, it may be quite sudden and almost always begins with numbness or coldness in one or more extremities, usually the feet. Ultimately, rest pain develops and progresses to gangrene. In this series, 68% of the patients underwent spontaneous or operative amputation, and the reamputation rate was 23.3%. Lower extremity involvement in blackfoot disease was observed in 97.7% of the cases. The average annual rate for major amputation was 3.81 per 100 patient-years. The factors influencing the prognosis, such as amputation in relation to age and disease onset, are analyzed. The case fatality rate was 66.5% during thirty years; 44% of these were cardiovascular deaths. The annual death rate was 4.84 per 100 patient-years. Other reported case fatality rates for vascular insufficiency are reviewed. A dose-response relationship between blackfoot disease and the duration of water intake was also noted. The survival rates after the onset of blackfoot disease were: five years, 76.0%; ten years, 59.5%; twenty years, 38.2%; thirty years, 28.6%. The 50% survival point was 13.5 years after onset of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the efficacy of intravenous (IV) (1.5-2 mg/kg) and oral propafenone (450 to 900 mg/day) in 16 patients with paroxysmal, sustained, recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). In 5 patients IV propafenone was not given, because of intolerant SVT. Nine patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. IV propafenone immediately stopped and prevented reinduction of SVT in 9/11 patients. Oral propafenone prevented SVT induction in 3 of 5 patients. In the 9 patients responsive to IV propafenone, oral propafenone was effective: in particular, in 6 patients SVT tachycardia was not induced by serial transesophageal pacings, and in the remaining 3 patients the arrhythmia was still induced but was slower and of brief duration (3-5 seconds). In 11/12 patients responsive to oral propafenone the minimum effective dosage in preventing the induction of the arrhythmia was 600 mg/day. In only 1 patient was the dose of 450 mg/day equally effective. Propafenone administration was not associated with major side effects. In conclusion, propafenone is very effective in the control of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; intravenous propafenone can predict the efficacy of oral therapy.\r"

A total of 51 patients (34 men, 17 women) kept the Cobe single- and double-lumen catheters for 1,726 days. The youngest patient was eighteen and the oldest seventy-two years of age. There were no catheter-related deaths. Complications were encountered in 9 patients. The only life-threatening complication was cardiac arrest, which occurred during flushing of the catheter. The patient was successfully revived. The other complications were pneumothorax and hydrothorax in 1 patient, catheter site infection in 5 patients, and arrhythmias in 2 patients, which stopped after readjustment of the catheter tips. Their experience indicates that percutaneous subclavian vein catheterization is safe and provides quick access for hemodialysis with no morbidity and mortality if done correctly, patiently, and meticulously. The authors believe that this should be the first choice in patients with reversible renal failure and in patients with chronic renal failure, who are usually elderly and medically compromised, till a permanent vascular access is ready for use.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of pressure-controlled postischemic reperfusion (Rp) on functional and metabolic parameters in hearts of sham-operated rats and hypertrophied hearts of rats with aortic constriction were studied. Hypertrophied hearts are considered to be more susceptible to ischemia. The hearts were perfused in the Langendorff-technique for thirty minutes at 35 degrees C with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at a perfusion pressure (PP) of 75 mmHg and for five minutes at 15 degrees C with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution at a PP of 60 mmHg. After a period of global ischemia of forty minutes' duration at 15 degrees C, reperfusion was started either abruptly (aRp: PP 75 mmHg immediately) or gently (gRp: PP 75 mmHg within thirty minutes); it lasted for forty-five minutes. Intraventricular peak systolic pressure (ISP) was monitored and energy-rich compounds (ATP, ADP, AMP, CrP, free Cr) were analyzed. In normal hearts, metabolic recovery was not affected by the mode of reperfusion, but functional recovery (ISP) averaged 88% of the preischemic control value after gRp as compared with 73% after aRp. In hypertrophied hearts, gentle reperfusion ameliorated both metabolic and functional recovery. At forty-five minute recovery, CrP averaged 5.1 mumol/g ww after aRp and 6.6 mumol/g ww after gRp (p less than 0.01), and ISP amounted to 73% of the preischemic control after aRp and to 85% after gRp.\r"

Both of the cases were found to have cerebral aneurysm, as well as multiple stenotic or occluded lesions in arteries such as renal, mesenteric, celiac, and internal carotid arteries. One case died of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the other case was successfully operated on for the aneurysm. This report suggests that FMD should be considered to be a systemic angiopathy including the cerebral artery, as well as the renal artery. Thus, cerebral angiography is recommended to detect the association with cerebral aneurysm, at least, in cases with multiple lesions of FMD. Occurrence of FMD in siblings also indicates that a genetic factor might be involved in the pathogenesis of FMD.\r"

Because of their effectiveness and safety, they are being selected as the drug of choice for maintenance therapy in children with asthma. The following study assessed compliance in asthmatic children using metaproterenol administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) on a daily basis. Compliance was determined in 17 asthmatic children (aged 5 to 13 years) by measurement of cannister weight before and after a 2-week treatment period. Five children were studied for one 2-week period, while 12 children were studied for two consecutive 2-week periods. Two of five children (40%) completing 2 weeks were compliant, while only one of 12 children (8%) completing 4 weeks of the study was determined to be compliant as judged by changes in cannister weight during the treatment period. We conclude that despite the efficacy and safety of beta 2 adrenergic agonists administered via a MDI, poor compliance could potentially detract from their value as a maintenance medication in some asthmatic children.\r"

The SP-containing filter paper strips were applied to the nasal mucosa for five minutes. The secretion was absorbed onto the filter papers. The strips were weighed before and after the experiment. Substance P induced atropine-resistant nasal secretion in a dose-dependent manner in anaesthetized dogs and rats. In man, SP failed to evoke nasal secretion in the doses applied. Systemic effects limited the dose that could be given to man. When exposed to nasal secretions SP was rapidly degraded. This may explain the failure of SP to evoke nasal secretion in man.\r"
