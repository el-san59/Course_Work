  ".W": "We determined the excitatory effects of direct nucleus tractus solitarii injection of angiotensin peptides after the sinoaortic nerves were cut unilaterally in rats under halothane anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later, recordings of mean arterial pressure and heart rate were obtained during injections of 2.5 ng angiotensin II or angiotensin-(1-7) in chloralose-urethane-anesthetized rats. Both peptides caused reductions in pressure and heart rate after nucleus tractus solitarii injections. In unilateral sinoaortic denervated rats, the hypotension and bradycardia produced with angiotensin II injections in either the ipsilateral (denervated) or contralateral (nondenervated) nucleus tractus solitarii were comparable. Angiotensin-(1-7), however, produced a larger decrease in pressure on the denervated side when compared with the nondenervated side. There were no differences in baseline pressure or heart rate between control rats and those with unilateral sinoaortic denervations. The effects of both angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) were blocked by previous administration of the angiotensin II antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]angiotensin II into the nucleus tractus solitarii. Assessment of angiotensin II binding sites in the solitary-vagal complex 24 hours after denervation showed a 13% reduction in angiotensin receptors. These findings confirm that both angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) express biological activity through receptor-mediated actions in the dorsal medulla oblongata. That the effects produced by angiotensin II do not require the integrity of baroreceptor input further suggests that the receptors responsible for the acute cardiovascular actions of this peptide reside on postsynaptic elements in the vagal-solitary complex.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics and extent of rapid or acute resetting of the aortic baroreceptors were studied in long-term renal hypertensive rats during 30 minutes of sustained hypertension produced by phenylephrine infusion. The aortic baroreceptors of hypertensive rats exhibited complete resetting to hypertension because during the control period the systolic threshold pressure for activation of the baroreceptors was similar (137 +/- 5 vs. 142 +/- 4 mm Hg) to the control diastolic pressure. Five minutes after onset of hypertension, a resetting of 32% (percent change of mean pressure threshold divided by total change of mean pressure) was demonstrable. The extent of resetting was 39%, 38%, and 41% after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of hypertension, respectively. When the percent change of systolic threshold pressure divided by total change of control diastolic pressure was used to calculate the extent of resetting, similar results were obtained. The extent of displacement of the entire baroreceptor pressure-response curves was similar to that of pressure thresholds. Reversibility of the resetting process was not complete within 30 minutes of pressure normalization after the administration of phenylephrine was interrupted. These data indicate that the characteristics and extent of rapid resetting of the baroreceptors of renal hypertensive rats, which were reset to operate at hypertensive levels, are similar to those previously described in normotensive rats.\r"

Reflex changes in HR were produced by intravenous bolus injections of either phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside (0.2-25.6 micrograms/kg) both after saline and after unilateral microinjection of Ang II into the NTS (24 ng, 0.2 microliter) and compared with those produced after administration of Ang II into the fourth ventricle (24 ng, 0.2 microliter) or intravenously (1-2 ng/kg/min). Baseline levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were not affected by the route of Ang II application but reflex bradycardia during MAP increase was significantly attenuated after injections of Ang II into the NTS. Both the slope and the intercept of the regression line function between delta HR and delta MAP were reduced by 43% from the control value of -1.55 +/- 0.13 beats/min/mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and -14 +/- 5 beats/min (p less than 0.05), respectively. Similar reductions were observed after Ang II administration into the fourth ventricle or intravenously, although microinjections into the cerebellum produced no effect. Endogenous blockade of Ang II by saralasin (22 ng) in the NTS facilitated the bradycardic response (-2.29 +/- 0.91 beats/min/mm Hg). Nitroprusside-induced tachycardia was not altered by Saralasin microinjection into the NTS or by Ang II application to the NTS, fourth ventricle, or intravenously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies in two-kidney--one clip hypertensive rats have demonstrated that long-term treatment with enalapril induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy, but the cardiac contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation remained depressed. In the present study, we evaluate the contractile response to beta-adrenergic stimulation of isolated papillary muscle in normal rats with isoproterenol (10(-11) M to 10(-4) M) in the presence of enalaprilic acid (10(-6) M or 10(-4) M) or enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) and angiotensin II (10(-6) M). Myocardial contractility was characterized by maximal developed tension and maximal rate of rise of tension (+T), and the relaxant effect of isoproterenol by the ratio of (+T), and the maximal velocity of relaxation (-T)(+T/-T ratio). The rest tension (g/mm2) and the cross-sectional area (mm2) were similar in all the muscles studied. Enalaprilic acid (either 10(-6) M or 10(-4) M) in the bath did not induce any change in contractile and relaxation parameters. The increment in +T and -T (expressed as percentage) in response to cumulative doses of isoproterenol (10(-11) M to 10(-4) M) was significantly depressed in the presence of enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) when compared with control hearts in which only vehicle was added before isoproterenol (p less than 0.05). The addition of angiotensin II after enalaprilic acid (10(-4) M) did not normalize the response in +T and -T. Enalaprilic acid diminishes the contractile response of the papillary muscle to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The inhibition of the local angiotensin II does not seem to be involved in this result.\r"

Mean arterial pressure was higher in EPM-Control and EPM-CRF rats as compared with MW and DI rats. MW and EPM rats with CRF showed increases of 120% and 196%, respectively, in single nephron glomerular filtration rate as compared with their controls. However, DI rats with CRF did not show any increase in single nephron glomerular filtration rate as compared with the control group. Therefore, the data suggest that the presence of hypertension enhances the adaptive mechanisms on remnant kidney's function. Conversely, in the absence of antidiuretic hormone, adaptive mechanisms of remnant nephrons did not occur. In addition, it was observed that rats with CRF submitted to prostaglandin blockade with indomethacin showed for MW rats a 55% and 20% reduction in ultrafiltration coefficient and in single nephron glomerular filtration rate, respectively. Decreases of 60% and 30% in ultrafiltration coefficient and single nephron glomerular filtration rate, respectively, were observed for EPM rats. In contrast, DI rats did not show any alteration on renal function after indomethacin. It seems, therefore, that prostaglandins play a role in remnant nephron function of MW and EPM rats, but in the absence of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins do not affect remnant glomerular hemodynamics.\r"

Both of these agents also induce changes in cytosolic calcium that are dependent on both mobilization of intracellular calcium and influx of extracellular calcium. We hypothesized that calcium channel blockers, by preventing influx of extracellular calcium, may inhibit proliferation induced by these mitogens. We found that three different calcium channel blockers, diltiazem, nifedipine, and verapamil, were able to significantly inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into human mesangial cells induced by either PDGF or thrombin. The inhibitory effect of these agents was significant at 10(-5) M. The calcium channel blockers also attenuated the increases in cell number and percentage of labeled nuclei induced by these mitogens. In contrast, dantrolene, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization, had no significant effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation by PDGF or thrombin. Finally, the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644 was found to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into mesangial cells. Although the mechanisms for these effects of calcium channel blockers are not proven, these studies suggest that influx of extracellular calcium is an important signal in mitogen-induced mesangial proliferation and that these agents can be beneficial in preventing or attenuating renal diseases characterized by proliferation of these cells.\r"

All rats were divided into three groups and fed one of the following isocaloric diets with 8% NaCl: a high linoleic acid (HLA) (20% sunflower oil), a moderate linoleic acid (5% lard oil + 15% sunflower oil), or a low linoleic acid (DLA) (20% lard oil). After 4 weeks of feeding, we determined intraerythrocyte sodium, potassium, and magnesium concentrations, intra-aortic and lymphocyte magnesium content, and erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant. Cytoplasmic free calcium concentration of lymphocytes from thymus was also determined with quin-2 as a fluorescent indicator. In the HLA group, the elevation of systolic blood pressure was significantly attenuated, and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly lower than in the DLA group. There were greater intraerythrocyte potassium and magnesium concentrations, intra-aortic and lymphocyte magnesium contents, and erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant in the HLA group as compared with other groups. Cytoplasmic free calcium concentration in the HLA group was significantly lower than in other groups. Systolic blood pressure significantly correlated negatively with intraerythrocyte and intra-aortic magnesium concentrations and intraerythrocyte potassium concentration, and correlated positively with cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. Erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant significantly correlated positively with intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration. These findings suggest that dietary linoleic acid can attenuate the development of DOCA-salt hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty-seven subjects, 70 +/- 5 years old (mean +/- SD), hypertensive or normotensive (blood pressure less than 160/90 mm Hg) were recruited for measurement of blood levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin, as well as density and affinity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors from platelet membranes, assessed by maximal binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of rauwolscine. They were separated into white hypertensive (n = 22) or normotensive (n = 41), and black hypertensive (n = 11) or normotensive (n = 13) groups, with similar age distribution throughout and similar blood pressure levels in the hypertensive and normotensive groups. Vasopressin was higher in the black hypertensive than white hypertensive group (1.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.5 pg/ml, respectively, p less than 0.005), whereas epinephrine correlated inversely with diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.7, p less than 0.02, in the black hypertensive group). Kd was higher in the black normotensive group than in the other groups (1.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2, 1.1 +/- 0.3, or 1.0 +/- 0.3 nM in the white normotensive, black hypertensive, or white hypertensive group, respectively, p less than 0.002). Bmax was no different among groups but was significantly correlated with vasopressin levels for the whole group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.0004) although no such correlation existed within the black hypertensive group. The data suggest that various vasoconstrictor systems participate to different extents in the mechanisms generating and sustaining hypertension in elderly white and black subjects.\r"

In this study, we addressed two related questions: 1) Can the greater intralymphocytic calcium concentration of the SHRSP account for the greater net potassium efflux? 2) Is the calcium sensitivity of calcium-activated potassium channels in lymphocytes from SHRSP different as compared with that of those from WKY rats? Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, caused a concentration-dependent and proportional increase in net potassium efflux and intracellular free calcium concentration in lymphocytes from both strains of rat. Based on the relations between net potassium efflux and intracellular free calcium concentration established with ionomycin, the resting net potassium efflux of lymphocytes from SHRSP is greater than would be predicted based on the resting intracellular free calcium concentration. Using the patch clamp technique, we were able to identify and characterize a calcium-activated potassium channel in the plasma membrane of lymphocytes from both strains of rat. Potassium currents were recorded that had a slope conductance of 18.1 +/- 1.49, n = 6, and 18.5 +/- 1.44, n = 7, in WKY rat and SHRSP thymocytes, respectively. The channel exhibited rectification of the outward current in both strains of rat. Channels tended to appear in clusters of two or more per patch and were recorded in 30-50% of the patches examined. Calcium sensitivity of the channels was similar; maximum activation occurred at 700 nM free calcium concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With polycarbonate (PC), PAF production and aggregation of neutrophils were both almost half the values with CU. PAF production was studied in ten hemodialysis (HD) patients tested twice with CU and once with PC and PMMA membranes. PAF was extracted in the venous blood during filling of the dialyser for 9/20 of patients with CU (3.1 +/- 2.9 ng/ml, mean +/- 1 S.D.) a membrane that induced marked leukopenia (greater than 50% of basal values at 15 min), C3a des Arg generation (greater than 500% at 5 min), and plasma levels of the elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor complex (greater than 500% at the end of HD).

However, with PMMA, plasma neutrophil elastase was significantly higher than baseline at the end of dialysis. These levels were not significantly different (p less than 0.05) from those observed with CU and PC membranes.\r"

Dipyridamole thallium-201 (Tl-201) perfusion imaging revealed myocardial perfusion defects in 8 patients (61%) from group A, 4 (50%) from group B and 1 (12.5%) from group C. These defects were localized in the inferior, posterior and septal segments of the left ventricle. Abnormal myocardial perfusion was associated with age over 50 years and aortic calcifications (p less than 0.05). Eight patients died within the following four years. All had aortic calcifications (p less than 0.001). Our results show that myocardial perfusion defects are frequent even in non-symptomatic HD patients. This suggests that ischemic heart disease could be more frequent than estimated by clinical symptoms alone. Tl-201 scintigraphy may be a useful non-invasive procedure in cardiological evaluation of HD patients.\r"

Serum bicarbonate levels rose from 18.6 +/- 2.9 to 22.5 +/- 4.0 mEq/L (p less than 0.0005) and pH rose from 7.35 +/- 0.03 to 7.39 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.0005).

Base therapy did not result in significant changes in serum levels of total calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin or potassium. If empiric therapy with exogenous base is given to dialysis patients, ionized calcium levels should be closely monitored since changes in calcium supplement or vitamin D therapy may be required to maintain ionized calcium and parathyroid hormone values at the pre-treatment levels.\r"

To compare the ammonia metabolism of hepatocytes cultivated under these two conditions, cultures of primary seeded rat hepatocytes were cultivated either attached to collagen coated tissue culture plastic or as a suspension culture. During the time course of culture, the ability of hepatocytes to reduce the ammonia content of the medium decreased in both adhesion and suspension cultures, though to different extents. In suspension cultures, ammonia content was reduced from 350 microM to about 100 microM (day 4) and to about 180 microM (day 6). No significant reduction was seen on day 8 of culture. In contrast, hepatocytes attached to collagen coated dishes remained viable and functional for at least 8 days after plating, reducing ammonia content from 350 microM to 70 microM (day 4), 90 microM (day 6) and 180 microM (day 8). The period of useful metabolism of hepatocytes in bioreactors for hybrid liver support systems appears to depend on the culture conditions.\r"

In order to better define the immune status of this disease we studied 21 patients for circulating immune complexes (CIC). Six out of them were also studied for lymphocyte subpopulations, IgG4 and anti-IgG antibodies, before (TO), 4 hours after (T4), and 72 hours after (T72) a specific challenge with 250 ml of milk. The ClqSp assay was used to determine CIC. Lymphocyte subpopulations were defined by the following monoclonal antibodies (Mab): OKT3, OKT4, OKT8, 4F2, H366, TAC, 5E9, L.243 and DA6.231. IgG4 subclass was assessed by using a mouse specific Mab. Anti-IgG antibodies were determined by using HPLC. The result showed an increased incidence of CIC (28.6%) when compared to the control group (10%). Total T-cells (OKT3+) showed a marked increase at T4 (p less than 0.01) and a subsequent decrease at T72 (p less than 0.02). Interestingly, T-activated cells (4F2+ and TAC+) showed a parallel trend at T4 (respectively p less than 0.02 and less than 0.01) and a subsequent decrease at T72 only for the Tac+ cells (p less than 0.05). Also K and NK cells (H366+) showed an early increase at T4 (p less than 0.05). No significant variation was observed in the study of the expression of DR antigens (L.243 and DA6.231) at the three times. IgG4 and anti-IgG antibodies values showed no variation in their time-course.+\r"

Despite lower filling pressures, subjects receiving hetastarch exhibited higher systolic blood pressures and cardiac outputs (p less than 0.05). Hematocrits on postoperative day 1 were lower in the group given hetastarch (p less than 0.001), suggesting prolonged intravascular expansion. The subjects given hetastarch also required significantly less time in the intensive care unit (p less than 0.001).

A Marquette Augmented Cardiograph was used to obtain 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) at baseline and at 3, 10, and 25 minutes after ingestion of 200 or 400 ml ice water. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess the significance of each factor alone and in interaction for both ST segments and T waves for 11 leads. The preliminary analysis of variance showed significant difference (p less than 0.10) in ST segments for position in several leads and in T waves for disease in several leads. Differences did not continue to be significant when they were considered across the four time periods (MANOVA); then time and volume were the significant variables for most leads. Mean change scores for ST segment (0.01 to 0.05) and T wave amplitude (0.01 to 0.88) were not clinically significant; however, a few patients had significant changes in ST segment of greater than 1 mm and T wave amplitude of greater than 10 mm.

By multiple regression analysis, confrontive coping strategies and spouse trait anxiety were the two factors predictive of couple marital functioning. When marital functioning scores were examined separately, spouses' confrontive behaviors and patient reported compliance for diet, stress, and smoking prescriptions were predictive of both spouse and patient marital functioning. In addition, spouse marital functioning was predicted by state anxiety and patient compliance, and patient marital functioning by compliance and shared responsibility for compliance.

A target sample was used to assign subjects to the treatment groups.

Experimental subjects (n = 25) attended a support group to share feelings and experiences in coping with illness. No significant differences were found in prestate or poststate anxiety scores between the two groups, but experimental subjects had a significant reduction in anxiety from premeasures to postmeasures (p less than or equal to 0.01).

Nine weeks after fracture, 24 patients had evidence of vasomotor instability, 23 had significant tenderness of the fingers and 23 had lost finger movement. These three abnormalities were significantly associated (p less than 0.001). Swelling was also significantly associated with these three variables. There was no statistical association between the occurrence of algodystrophy and the patient's age or sex, the severity of the fracture, the number of reductions performed or the adequacy of the reduction. We conclude that algodystrophy constitutes a precisely definable and quantifiable syndrome which is more common than has been suspected.\r"

Four patients had homogenously diploid primary tumours, with solitary metastases. Six patients had aneuploid primary tumours, three with solitary and three with multiple metastases. In two patients radical excision of diploid metastases resulted in long disease-free intervals. Patients with diploid tumours survived significantly longer than patients with aneuploid tumours. These results indicate that tumour DNA content might be a useful prognostic indicator. The measurement of DNA content may be a suitable method of identifying those patients likely to survive long enough to benefit from major surgical resection and reconstruction.\r"

External fixation is recommended as the method of choice for the stabilisation of the skeletal injury. A selective policy is advised for fasciotomy.\r"

The reported frequency of peripheral nerve complications varies from 5% to 30%, but is probably underestimated. Damage may be direct or be caused by overstretching of the nerves. We have used electrophysiological tests to evaluate five patients during bilateral tibial lengthening by the Ilizarov method. Results after 24 to 107 days of lengthening showed electromyographic evidence of partial muscle denervation in all 10 limbs, with reduced motor conduction velocities in two tibial nerves and three common peroneal nerves. The sensory conduction velocity in the sural nerve was always unchanged. A clear relationship was shown between the amount of tibial lengthening and the degree of electrophysiological abnormality. Our results suggest that subclinical nerve damage is a very frequent complication of tibial lengthening.\r"

Both dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D3 had a direct effect on endochondral bone formation. 24,25(OH)2D3 strengthened the callus, and raised alkaline phosphate activity in the first seven days after fracture. 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the strength of the callus concomitant with a reduction in 45Ca incorporation.

Most complications were the general ones of operating on elderly patients. Specific complications included: fractures below an abnormal hip, proximal fracture related to the nail and poor purchase in the distal femur. In all survivors, the femoral shaft fractures united satisfactorily, and the fixation allowed early mobilisation. The locking nail appears to be an effective method of managing femoral shaft fractures in the elderly patient.\r"

The overall rate of mechanical failure was 16.5%; cutting-out of the implant from the femoral head was the cause in three-quarters of the instances. Implants placed posteriorly in the femoral head cut out more often (27%) than those placed centrally (7%). The cut-out rate was also determined by the quality of the fracture reduction, but age, walking ability and bone density (assessed by the Singh grade and metacarpal indices) had no significant influence. We conclude that these fractures should be reduced as accurately as possible and it is imperative that the implant is placed centrally within the femoral head.\r"

In the five control hips the top screw was more distal. In the nine patients (mean follow-up 10.8 years) there was an increase of 14 degrees in the neck-shaft angle (p = 0.01) and of 18 degrees in the angle between the capital femoral physis and the shaft (p = 0.01) compared to the control group.

Linear displacement was related to fracture instability, but the neck-shaft angle was relatively constant during healing.

The overall results were reasonable, with good to excellent Mayo hip scores in 62% and little or no pain in 86%. These results were independent of body weight, age, primary diagnosis and type of arthroplasty used. The incidence of radiological loosening was alarming, though comparable to that found in other series. Our findings indicate that it may be wise to replace both components even when, after careful assessment before and during operation, one of them seems to be securely fixed.\r"

The functional results were much the same, though meniscectomy had been performed in almost half of the surgical patients. Time in bed and duration of hospital stay were clearly shorter after surgery (p less than 0.0001). We concluded that conservative management is a valid alternative to surgery, but should probably be reserved for cases where operation is undesirable. Future studies should compare surgery without meniscectomy and conservative treatment using cast braces to reduce the time in traction.\r"

The patients were all relatively young and had many previous operations. Their pre-operative Harris hip rating averaged 46 points (range 18 to 73). All the allografts united and there were no infections. However, 12 acetabular components (32%) became loose; six of these had needed revision using the healed allograft, and two hips had required resection arthroplasty. The 30 surviving hips had a mean Harris hip score of 82 points. Some radiographic evidence of graft resorption was seen in 23 hips, though this was mild in 17. The extent of cover provided by the allograft and the severity of graft resorption both correlated with acetabular loosening. Although structural allografts had allowed successful hip reconstructions in many of these patients with major bone loss, the failure rate had increased from zero at four years to 32% at six years; clearly they provide only a short-term solution.\r"

Isolated axillary nerve lesions had the poorest prognosis for spontaneous recovery. We explored all lesions that showed no recovery after three to five months and performed either grafting or neurolysis. We discuss the combinations of nerve lesions, their recovery, the surgical indications, and the operations. We also suggest a new classification for these injuries which is more clinically relevant than the anatomical classification of Leffert and Seddon (1965).\r"

Early diagnosis depends on awareness of the possibility of AARF, and either fluoroscoping the patient in order to take appropriate spot films or imaging the atlanto-axial joint by CT. A simple classification of AARF is proposed based on distinct radiological features which differentiate subluxation from dislocation.\r"

Of 294 osteosarcoma patients reviewed, 249 had primary skeletal tumours, and for these the mean annual incidence was 2.1 per million, without any clear trend over time. The mean male/female ratio for the period was 1.6 again with no consistent pattern over time; nor was there any significant change in the distribution of tumours according to location. The only feature which showed a significant change over the 14-year period was the mean age of the patients, being at its lowest (19 years) in 1972 and at its highest (40 years) in 1981. Excluding the 22 patients with craniofacial tumours, the remaining 227 also showed a significant increase in mean age. Analysis of the annual age distribution disclosed an increasing fraction of patients older than those in the classical age peak between 10 and 29 years. A large number of trials have shown improved survival in osteosarcoma over the last 15 years, which has been attributed mainly to adjuvant chemotherapy. The change we have observed in age distribution should also be taken into account in the evaluation of the results of treatment; it may be that older patients have a better prognosis.\r"

Compared with previous reports heparin appeared to have reduced the number of distal and contralateral thromboses, but was far less effective in reducing proximal femoral thrombosis. In a cadaver study, the femoral veins were inspected during simulated total hip replacement by either an anterior or a posterior approach. In every case the femoral vein became kinked or folded in the thigh position imposed during the preparation of the femur. Local damage appears to be an important factor in proximal thrombosis; care at operation could help to minimise trauma to the femoral veins and reduce the number of such cases.\r"

The results indicate that when dietary calcium and phosphorus are normal and glomerular filtration rate is not reduced, the serum concentrations, MCRs, and production rates of 1,25-(OH)2D in old men [83 +/- 22 pmol/L; 0.62 +/- 0.10 mL/s.70 kg ideal BW (IBW); 51 +/- 12 fmol/s.70 kg IBW, respectively] and young men (90 +/- 20 pmol/L; 0.56 +/- 0.09 mL/s.70 kg IBW; 52 +/- 13 fmol/s.70 kg IBW, respectively) are equivalent. Indices of serum PTH, however, were elevated in the elderly men. These results suggest that aging per se has little or no effect on the serum concentration, MCR, or production rate of 1,25-(OH)2D in men. Maintenance of a normal production rate of 1,25-(OH)2D in elderly men, however, may require increased circulating PTH. Most observed declines in serum 1,25-(OH)2D in elderly men are probably a consequence of decreased functional renal mass.\r"

To investigate this issue we administered im iodized oil (1.5 mL) to 28 hypothyroid endemic cretins (TSH, greater than 5 mIU/L) from western China, aged 14-52 yr (mean = 29 SD = 11 yr). Clinical examination, intelligence testing (Hiskey Nebraska Test of Learning Aptitude and the Griffiths Mental Development Scales), and thyroid function tests were performed before and 6 months after iodine supplementation. We found that signs of thyroid hormone deficiency, dwarfism, and delayed sexual maturity persisted after iodine supplementation. Further, mental disability and other clinical features of neurological damage were not altered by treatment. The mean serum concentration of total T4 before treatment was 75 nmol/L (SD = 40) and fell after iodized oil administration to 56 nmol/L (SD = 29; P less than 0.001). Mean serum levels of TSH before and after iodine showed a paradoxical fall [85 mIU/L (SD = 102) and 46 mIU/L (SD = 46), respectively]. Serum TSH levels decreased into the normal range (less than 5 mIU/L) in only 1 of 28 patients (4%). We conclude that iodine supplementation does not reverse thyroid hormone deficiency or its sequelae in adolescents and adults with endemic myxedematous cretinism. Iodized oil in this age group of patients with endemic cretinism does not appear to be beneficial and should be used with caution.\r"

The changes in sulfatase activity, determined by measuring the rate of formation of estrone from tritiated estrone sulfate, were associated with in vitro decidualization of the stromal cells, as determined by changes in secretion of PRL into daily renewed culture medium. PRL output by the cells during the last 24 h in culture and sulfatase activity in the cells collected at the end of the culture period were related to their DNA and protein contents. Sulfatase activity in the cells cultured in the presence of the ovarian hormones was comparable to the activity found in decidual cells at term pregnancy. PRL added for 1 day to cultures of stromal cells in the absence of exogenous hormones increased sulfatase activity in the cells, probably by acting in an autocrine manner, as previously demonstrated with human decidual cells during pregnancy. These experiments also revealed a hormonal regulation of stromal cell proliferation in vitro, as estimated from measurements of both DNA and protein levels per dish. Augmentation of sulfatase activity can serve as another marker of in vitro decidualization. Physiologically, an increase in this enzymatic activity may result in a preferential estrogenic stimulation of the decidualized cells by utilization of a circulating substrate, estrone sulfate. This hypothesis could explain the preferential retention of progesterone receptors in decidual cells observed immunohistochemically during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, suggestive of a shift in progestogenic actions from the epithelium to the stroma.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the time courses of serum inhibin and estradiol responses to ovarian hyperstimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer as well as their predictive value for outcome of intermediate variables and pregnancy in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Blood samples (n = 749) were collected for up to 6 days before hCG administration in 100 consecutive treatment cycles, of which 44 resulted in pregnancy, as defined by elevated luteal phase serum hCG beta levels. Inhibin and estradiol levels increased markedly in parallel during hyperstimulation and were highly correlated (r = 0.89; P less than 0.001). Inhibin responses were significantly lower in women 35 yr of age or older (P less than 0.001), although estradiol responses were not influenced by age. Gravidity and tubal disease also had marginal effects on the time course of inhibin responses, but not on overall mean inhibin levels or estradiol responses. The time course of hormonal responses to hyperstimulation was not influenced by any other demographic or etiological factors. Peak values of both hormones correlated with the total number of follicles (inhibin, r = 0.70; estradiol, r = 0.65; P less than 0.001) and oocytes retrieved per cycle (inhibin, r = 0.49; estradiol, r = 0.39; P less than 0.001). The time course and peak values of inhibin and estradiol responses to hyperstimulation did not differ significantly between conception or nonconception cycles whether judged by biochemical (luteal hCG beta) or clinical (viable ongoing pregnancy) criteria. Luteal phase serum inhibin, estradiol, progesterone, and hCG levels were significantly higher in conception than in nonconception cycles (P less than 0.001). These data suggest that the rises in serum inhibin and estradiol levels during hyperstimulation have similar predictive properties for IVF-ET outcomes and could, therefore, be used interchangeably to monitor hyperstimulation regimens. The age-related reduction in inhibin, but not estradiol, responses suggests that these two hormones reflect different granulosa cell functions and that serum inhibin responses to maximal ovarian stimulation may be a sensitive and early index of declining ovarian function with advancing age.\r"

  ".W": "We used a highly purified preparation of the naturally occurring core fragment of hCG beta (beta-core) and a new RIA for beta-core to investigate the concentrations and behavior of beta-core in serum and urine. We collected serum and 24-h urine specimens from healthy pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. The concentrations of beta-core in serum were determined by analysis of fractions eluted from Sephadex G-100. Serum concentrations of beta-core immunoreactivity were very low (0.13-1.25 micrograms/L), while large amounts of beta-core were excreted in urine during pregnancy (as much as 4-5 mg/day). Interference with measurement by serum factors did not account for the low levels of beta-core immunoreactivity in pregnancy serum. Based on the known urinary clearance rate of beta-core in healthy nonpregnant subjects, we calculated that urinary clearance of serum beta-core accounts for only about 1% of the beta-core in pregnancy urine. We conclude that during pregnancy, the concentrations of beta-core in plasma are measurable, but extremely low, and that most of the beta-core in urine is derived by mechanisms other than urinary clearance of serum beta-core; most likely, these mechanisms involve nephrogenous production of beta-core from precursor molecules such as hCG and hCG beta.\r"

  ".W": "Visual perceptual integrative motor ability was investigated in 719 6- to 12-yr-old, presumably normal, primary schoolchildren living in 2 iodine-deficient endemic goiter areas in Sicily, identified on the basis of the presence (area A) or absence (area B) of endemic cretinism, by administrating the Bender Gestalt test. All of these clinically euthyroid schoolchildren were also examined neurologically by an investigator unaware of the result of the Bender test. Ninety-nine (13.76%) schoolchildren were found to be defective by the Bender test; this prevalence was significantly higher than that (3.0%) found in an iodine-sufficient goiter-free control area (area C) lying at sea level (chi 2 = 36.25; P less than 0.000001). No difference in the prevalence of Bender abnormalities was apparent if the children were divided according to the area of provenience (area A, 14.4%; area B, 13.1%). A high percentage of children falling in the lower range of normality was found in both area A (15.5%) and area B (19.0%); this was significantly higher than that in area C (3.8%; chi 2 = 77.55; P less than 0.000001). Neuromuscular and neurosensorial abnormalities, including increased tendon reflexes, clonus of the foot, Babinski sign, minor disturbances in balance, and gait, and minor defects in hearing and speech, were apparent in 19.3% (area A) and 18.5% (area B) of the children. These disorders were significantly more frequent in defective children identified by the Bender test (33.3%) than in normal children (15.3%; (chi 2 = 17.29; P less than 0.00005). The general intellectual aptitude in Bender deficient subjects was evaluated by the Terman Merrill test and was found to be impaired in 95%, thus confirming the existence of an endemic cognitive deficiency (ECD), distinct from the endemic mental deficiency previously found in other endemic goiter, iodine-deficient areas. ECD seems to be epidemiologically independent of the existence of endemic cretinism. Further clinical auxological and biochemical studies in a selected group of ECD children suggested the epidemiological and, possibly, pathogenic association of cognitive impairment with iodine deficiency.\r"

A small goiter was present in 9 of the 12 index patients, tender upon palpation in only 2. Signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis were accompanied by a low grade fever in combination with fatigue, headache, myalgia, and a fine desquamation of the palms and soles. The apparent incubation time between family members was 6 days. Thyroid technetium uptake was decreased in 10 of 11 tested patients. Laboratory findings included elevated sedimentation rates (up to 68 mm/h), increased liver enzymes, lymphopenia in 2 patients, and absence of thyroid autoantibodies. HLA-B35, associated with classical subacute thyroiditis, was found in 1 patient only. An etiological agent was not identified. No evidence was found for thyrotoxicosis factitia. After 10 months, all patients were euthyroid, without a goiter or thyroid autoantibodies. Thus, a new variant of thyroiditis, atypical subacute thyroiditis, was probably the cause of this unusual outbreak. It is unclear at present if this variant of thyroiditis is common in communities and represents a separate disease entity.\r"

A major proportion of GH circulates in complexed form, which differs in kinetics and possibly bioactivity from free GH. Little is known about the regulation of the GH-BP, their constancy or variation in plasma, or plasma factors affecting GH binding. Consequently, the temporal pattern of bound and free GH in plasma is also unknown. Knowledge about possible spontaneous variability in GH-BP levels/activity is required for physiological investigations and comparative studies among different populations. To address these issues, we measured GH-binding activity in plasma every hour over a 24-h period in six normal adults (three men and three women). A standardized GH binding assay, employing incubation of plasma with [125I]GH and separation of bound from free GH by gel filtration, was used. GH-BP activity showed no significant diurnal variation in any subject. The average GH-BP activity was similar in all subjects, although statistically significant differences were found between some subjects. No age- or sex-related differences were identified. We conclude that in normal man plasma GH-BP activity is constant throughout the day, thereby implying 1) constancy of binding protein (and possibly GH receptor) concentration, and 2) absence of significant fluctuations in potential binding inhibitors/enhancers in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "The possible presence of gonadotropin receptors in nonpregnant human uterus and human fetoplacental unit was investigated by light microscope immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to rat luteal hCG/LH receptors. The receptor antibody cross-reacted with human and bovine hCG/LH receptors and appears to be directed against the receptor rather than other proteins, including HLA class I antigens. Uterus and fetoplacental unit contained receptor antibody-binding sites, which indicates the presence of hCG/LH receptors. In the endometrium these receptors were present in glandular and luminal epithelial cells as well as in stromal cells. In the myometrium the receptors were detected in circular and elongated myometrial smooth muscle and vascular smooth muscle. Comparison of immunostaining intensities, which indicates the presence of different amounts of receptors, revealed that luminal and glandular epithelial cells contained more receptors than stromal cells. These cells, in turn, contained more receptors than myometrial and vascular smooth muscle. All cells in secretory phase uterine specimens contained more receptors than corresponding cells from the proliferative phase of the cycle. Midpregnancy placenta, amniotic epithelium, chorionic cytotrophoblasts, and decidual cells contained hCG/LH receptors. At term pregnancy, while receptors in fetal membranes and decidua continue to be detected, placental tissues did not show any detectable receptors unless the tissues were pretreated with neuraminidase. This indicated that term pregnancy placenta contain hCG/LH receptors masked by sialic acid residues. Comparison of immunostaining intensities suggested that syncytiotrophoblasts contained more receptors than cytotrophoblasts at midpregnancy; mesenchymal cells or blood vessels contained no detectable receptors. There were more receptors in decidua than in fetal membranes at mid- and term pregnancy. While the amniotic epithelial receptors decreased, the receptors in chorionic cytotrophoblasts and decidual cells increased from mid- to term pregnancy. In summary, hCG/LH receptors were demonstrated in the nonpregnant human uterus, human placenta, fetal membranes, and decidua. This indicates that hCG/LH may directly regulate functions of these tissues by endocrine, autocrine, or paracrine mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90130930\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperandrogenic women appear to demonstrate an exaggerated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) response to adrenal stimulation which is not due to the marked 21-hydroxylase deficiency of late-onset adrenal hyperplasia (LOAH). Furthermore, in hyperandrogenism the ovary also appears to secrete excessive amounts of 17-HP. It is not clear to what extent the elevated 17-HP levels after ACTH stimulation are due to extraadrenal production of the steroid. This investigation was undertaken to assess the adrenal contribution to the elevated 17-HP levels after ACTH stimulation observed in non-LOAH hyperandrogenism. One hundred and sixty consecutive unselected women with hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea formed the clinical population. Excluded were 4 women with LOAH and all patients with hyperprolactinemia. For the purpose of investigating the relationship between adrenal response and clinical symptoms, hyperandrogenic patients were divided into 3 subgroups: hirsute only (n = 23), hirsute oligomenorrheic (n = 84), and oligomenorrheic only (n = 24). Subclassification for an additional 29 patients (18%) with hyperandrogenemia was not possible, since their symptomatology was not clearly stated in the record. However, these individuals were included in the patient group as a whole. Controls consisted of 21 healthy, regularly menstruating, nonhirsute female volunteers. Both patients and controls underwent acute adrenal stimulation with 1 mg ACTH-(1-24), and serum was obtained before and 30 min after ACTH administration. Hyperandrogenic patients had higher mean basal total testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHS), 17-HP, and LH/FSH levels, but not cortisol (F), compared to normal subjects (P less than 0.02). Oligomenorrheic only women had higher mean A and progesterone (P) levels than other hyperandrogenic patients (P less than 0.02). No correlation was noted between body mass index (BMI) and the levels of DHS, P, or A, while a weak positive association was noted between the BMI and the mean T (r = 0.31; P less than 0.002) and a weak negative correlation between the mean F and BMI (r = -0.21; P less than 0.05). The mean 17-HP level 30 min after ACTH administration (17-HP30) was significantly higher in hyperandrogenic women than in normal subjects whether analyzed in separate subgroups or together and was due to the higher basal 17-HP levels. Basal 17-HP correlated with the circulating levels of T, A, and P, steroids largely of ovarian origin. Alternatively, the net increment in 17-HP from 0-30 min after ACTH (delta 17-HP30) was not significantly higher in hyperandrogenic women than normal subjects and did not correlate with the basal levels of T, A, and P. Neither the basal level of 17-HP nor its response to ACTH correlated with circulating DHS levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A strain of differentiated rat thyroid cells (FRTL5) in continuous culture was used to study the presence of thyroid growth-promoting immunoglobulins (TGI) in the serum of patients with endemic and sporadic euthyroid goiters. To identify true in vitro cell proliferation a microscopic mitotic arrest assay was used. Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) were prepared with QAE-Sephadex A-50 or protein-A-Sepharose. A positive growth stimulation index was found in IgG preparations of 65 of 71 patients with endemic goiter and in 9 of 14 IgG preparations of patients with sporadic goiter. IgG preparations of 15 control subjects from an area where endemic goiter due to iodine deficiency does not occur and of 18 subjects without iodine deficiency and without thyroid enlargement living in the endemic area did not stimulate FRTL5 cell growth. FRTL5 cell growth stimulation with IgGs of these euthyroid goiter patients could only be detected when IgG was tested in combination with a small dose of TSH. Immunoprecipitation with polyclonal and monoclonal antihuman IgG was able to abolish the growth-promoting effects. In 32 blinded samples the Feulgen cytobiochemical assay, formerly used to detect TGI, was compared with the FRTL5 mitotic arrest assay. The two methods showed similar results. Our observations of chromatographically purified IgG promoting thyroid cell proliferation in vitro provide good evidence that IgG was responsible for thyroid cell growth in vitro and suggest that autoimmune growth mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of both endemic and sporadic goiters.\r"

A measure of the fructose-6-P cycle was the incorporation of 14C, on administering [3-3H,6-14C]galactose, into carbon 1 of blood glucose and the 3H/14C ratio in blood glucose. The measure of the pentose cycle was the randomization of 14C to carbon 1 of blood glucose on administering [2-14C]galactose. [2-3H]Galactose was also administered, so the 3H/14C ratio in blood glucose measured the extent of equilibration of glucose-6-P with fructose-6-P. Patients given [3-3H,6-14C]galactose were restudied when euthyroid. Of the 14C from [3-3H,6-14C]galactose, 7.7-9.5% was in carbon 1 of glucose in both states. 3H/14C ratios were also the same in both states. Fructose-6-P cycling was estimated to be 13 +/- 1% the rate of glucose turnover in the euthyroid and 15 +/- 1% that in the hyperthyroid state. The pentose cycle contributed about 2% to glucose utilization, similar to previous estimates in healthy humans. As in healthy individuals, about 25% of 3H was retained in the conversion of [2-3H]glucose-6-P to glucose. Thus, the fractions of glucose turnover participating in hepatic fructose-6-P and pentose cycling are similar in hyperthyroid and healthy subjects. As a result, augmented fructose-6-P cycling does not substantially contribute to increased hepatic oxygen consumption in hyperthyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "Reliable markers of bone formation are essential to the investigation of metabolic bone disorders. In this regard, evidence indicates that circulating levels of human osteocalcin (OC) correlate with the skeletal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase and can be used as an index of bone formation. A disadvantage of using serum OC as a marker of formation is its diurnal variation. To address this problem we carried out our studies to determine the usefulness of urine in the assessment of bone turnover. Using a midmolecule specific human OC RIA, we were able to detect OC in urine of normal adults (42 mugeq/g creatinine), normal children (849 mu/geq/g creatinine), and Paget's disease patients (613 mugeq/g creatinine). Immunoreactive fragments of OC in human urine and human serum were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Multiple fragments were found in normal adult urine that were not detected in normal adult serum. Uremic and Paget's disease sera contain several immunoreactive forms of OC, other than the intact molecule, not found in normal adult serum. Additionally, both Paget's disease sera and urine contained a specific peak of immunoreactive material, eluting at 25% acetonitrile, that was not found in any other serum or urine tested. Urinary OC (uOC) correlated with both skeletal alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.91) and serum OC (r = 0.83), indices of skeletal formation. While uOC has a diurnal variation similar to that of serum OC, determinations of 24-h uOC give integrated values of daily bone turnover rates. Z-Score analysis indicates that uOC (z = 14.04) is better able to distinguish between normal children with high bone turnover and normal adults than either skeletal alkaline phosphatase (z = 8.87) or serum OC (z = 9.01).\r"

  ".W": "Androgen and estrogen production rates were examined in 29 morbidly obese women with upper or lower body obesity. Although blood production rates of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione (A4) were elevated in all of these women, those with upper body obesity (waist-height ratios, greater than 0.85) had higher T and production rates than women with lower body obesity (waist-height ratio less than 0.75). A4 was equally elevated in women with upper and lower body obesity. Peripheral aromatization of A4 to estrone (E1) averaged 1.67% in women with upper body obesity, but was elevated at 2.54% in women with lower body obesity. Urinary E1 production rates averaged 466 +/- 295 nmol/day (172 +/- 109 micrograms/day) in women with upper body obesity. Thus, women with lower body obesity had higher E1 production rates due entirely to increased peripheral aromatization. Women with upper body obesity were observed to have higher serum T and estradiol (E2) levels than women with lower body obesity. Further, upper body obesity was associated with decreased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (16.1 +/- 5.7 nmol/L vs. 18.9 +/- 6.1 in women with lower body obesity). As a result, free T levels averaged 98.8 +/- 39.2 pmol/L in women with upper body obesity vs. 82.2 +/- 33 in women with lower body obesity. Similarly, serum free E2 levels were higher in women with upper body vs. lower body obesity. The data demonstrate that sex hormone production and metabolism are different in morbidly obese women with these differing phenotypes. Women with upper body obesity have higher androgen production rates and higher free T and free E2 levels, whereas women with lower body obesity make increased amounts of E1 from peripheral aromatization. The biological significance of increased aromatization may be offset by increased free E2 levels in women with upper body obesity.\r"

It is well established that IL-1 mediates a number of immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, the production of IL-1 appears to be modulated by the gonadal estradiol and progesterone, leading to this study of IL-1 secretion by cultured peripheral monocytes isolated at varying times during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Circulating peripheral monocytes were isolated from eight women undergoing human menopausal gonadotropin-stimulated ovulation induction during the late follicular phase just before hCG administration and from eight similarly stimulated women on the 12th day after hCG administration. Peripheral monocytes were also isolated from six women during both second and third trimester pregnancy. After 48 h in culture, conditioned media were assayed for IL-1 bioactivity using the D1O lymphocyte proliferation assay. Significantly more IL-1 bioactivity was secreted by monocytes isolated in the luteal phase of the cycle (52.4 +/- 17.5 IU/mL) compared to that in late follicular phase (5.2 +/- 0.9 IU/mL; P = 0.001) or third trimester of pregnancy (7.0 +/- 1.5 IU/mL; P = 0.006). Thus, peripheral monocyte IL-1 secretion appears to be increased by luteal levels of progesterone, although further elevation of progesterone during pregnancy returns IL-1 levels to the preovulatory baseline. In addition, basal body temperatures obtained in four women during third trimester pregnancy were 98 F or less. Thus, IL-1 secretion from cultured monocytes appears to increase with luteal concentrations of progesterone and decrease to preovulatory levels at higher concentrations of the steroid during pregnancy, which may account for the dissociation of high progesterone levels and elevated basal body temperature during late pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "A human small cell lung cancer cell line (COR L103) that actively expresses the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene has been used as a model of extrapituitary ACTH-secreting tumors to investigate the phenomenon of resistence of ACTH production to glucocorticoids. After both short term (24 h) and long term (10 days) exposure to hydrocortisone at concentrations of 500 and 1000 nM, the accumulation of intracellular POMC mRNA, ACTH, and ACTH precursor peptides in the culture medium was not suppressed. These finding contrast with those in the pituitary corticotroph cell line AtT20, in which POMC mRNA, ACTH, and ACTH precursors were suppressed under the same conditions. Two other genes that are regulated by glucocorticoids in other cell types, the tyrosine amino transferase gene and the glucocorticoid receptor gene, were expressed in COR L103 cells. However, neither gene appeared to be regulated by hydrocortisone in this small cell lung cancer cell line. Further studies demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor binding could be detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a Kd of 5 X 10(-9) M. It is concluded that nonsuppression of POMC by glucocorticoids is probably part of a more global defect of glucocorticoid signaling in these cells, but that this defect lies distal to steroid binding in the nucleus.\r"

  ".W": "We compared in 15 patients with hyperthyroidism (11 with Graves' disease, 3 with toxic adenoma, and 1 with multinodular goiter) platelet counts (PC) and mean platelet volume (MPV) before and 3 weeks after initiation of antithyroid drug therapy when the patients were euthyroid. In addition, platelet kinetic studies of autologous 111-indium-labeled platelets and platelet-associated immunoglobulins G and M (PAIgG and PAIgM, respectively) were investigated. The control group for the platelet kinetic studies consisted of 2 patients with diffuse nontoxic goiter and 86 patients who were studied for evaluation of their arteriosclerotic vascular disease. After 3 weeks of antithyroid drug therapy there was a significant increase in PC and a decrease in MPV compared with the pretreatment values (pretreatment PC median, 215 X 10(9)/L; range, 96-350 X 10(9)/L; PC median 3 weeks later, 248 X 10(9)/L; range, 157-384 X 10(9)/L; P less than 0.005; pretreatment MPV median, 10.6 fL; range, 9.1-13.2 fL; MPV 3 weeks later, 9.9 fL; range, 8.4-11.0 fL; P less than 0.005). 111-Indium platelet recovery was normal in all subjects. Platelet lifespan was significantly shortened in the patients with hyperthyroidism compared with the control group (median, 163.8 h; range, 128.5-206 h; vs. 180.0 h; range, 138.3-231.5 h; P less than 0.05). Platelet turnover averaged 45.6 (range, 25.6-71.9) X 10(9)/L.day; values above the limit of normal were found in 7 of 15 patients with hyperthyroidism. Three patients with Graves' disease had elevated levels of PAIgG; 1 of these patients had elevated levels of PAIgM and was the only patient with thrombocytopenia (PC, 96 X 10(9)/L). Various combinations of statistical correlations between the degree of hyperthyroidism, pretreatment PC and MPV, platelet kinetic studies, levels of PAIg, and serum levels of antithyroid antibodies revealed no significant differences. These findings suggest that the platelet changes observed in hyperthyroidism, such as lower PC and increased MPV, together with the shortened platelet lifespan reflect metabolically rather than immunologically mediated phenomena, although these may be involved in cases with marked thrombocytopenia.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to examine the role of TSH and cAMP in human thyroid cell proliferation. For this purpose, human thyrocytes were cultured in the absence or presence of TSH, cAMP analogs, or forskolin, and the following parameters were measured during 7 consecutive days: [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, cell count (to assess cell proliferation), and cAMP accumulation. Cells proliferated during the first days in culture, reaching a maximum on day 5, followed by a decline in cell growth. TSH dose-dependently enhanced thyrocyte proliferation during the first few days of culture, but attenuated cell growth during the later stages of culture. The TSH mitogenic action was only apparent at a low cell density (10(4) cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates). TSH elicited a dose-dependent elevation of cAMP during all phases of cell culture. Furthermore, the cAMP analogs, 8-bromo-cAMP and dibutyryl cAMP, mimicked the thyrocyte proliferative and antiproliferative actions of TSH. Forskolin also mimicked the TSH mitogenic and antimitogenic effects while concomitantly elevating cAMP levels during both instances. The data, therefore, seem entirely consistent with the premise that the TSH stimulatory and inhibitory actions on human thyroid cell growth are mediated, at least partially, by cAMP. The dual actions of TSH as a mitogenic and antimitogenic factor may, thus, provide an experimental in vitro basis for the well established in vivo goitrogenic effect of TSH observed initially, followed by desensitization on prolonged exposure to the hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Immunocytochemistry and Northern analysis were used to show that relaxin is a product of intrauterine tissues of pregnancy. In addition, tissues from a patient without ovaries had similar results on both immunocytochemistry and Northern analysis as tissues from intact patients. The parietal decidua was clearly the major source of relaxin within the uterus and the relaxin mRNA (1.2 kilobases) from this tissue was detected with a 48-mer oligonucleotide probe designed to hybridize with both H1 and H2 relaxin gene transcripts. The mRNA isolated from the placental trophoblast was slightly smaller (1.1 kilobases), and the placental basal plate which has both maternal and fetal cells contained relaxin mRNAs of both sizes. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) raised to synthetic human relaxin (H2) gave different patterns of localization in the fetal membranes, decidua and placenta. One Mab (RLX8) stained the chorionic cytotrophoblast in the fetal membranes and all of the cells in the placental basal plate. The other Mab (RLX6) stained the chorionic cytotrophoblast in some instances and selectively stained the decidua-like cells of the placental syncytiotrophoblast, whereas Mab RLX8 failed to detect this relaxin. Tissues obtained after spontaneous labor and delivery contained significantly less relaxin mRNA than tissues obtained at elective cesarean section without labor, but their hormone contents, as judged by immunocytochemistry, were not different. We conclude that the relaxin gene (H2) is expressed in intrauterine tissues, but that expression and hormone synthesis are not ubiquitous. Whether the relaxin gene H1 is expressed has not been determined.\r"

The secreted proteins represented approximately 20% of the total incorporation of methionine into cytosolic proteins. De novo synthesis and secretion of placental protein-14 (PP14) and not PP12 was identified by a novel combination of line immunoelectrophoresis and autoradiography. All monolayer cultures demonstrated the presence of radiolabeled PP14, but not PP12, in the culture supernatants. These observations suggest that the glandular epithelial cells are the major site of synthesis and secretion of PP14 in human gestational endometrium.\r"

After 10 days of dietary equilibration and control collections, subjects were randomly assigned to receive 0.03, 0.06, or 0.12 mg/kg rhGH by daily injection for 7 days. A brisk rise in circulating somatomedin-C (insulin-like growth factor-I) occurred in all subjects, and this rise was dose dependent. rhGH produced striking changes in nitrogen retention, sodium excretion, and the parathyroid-vitamin D axis. Twenty-four-hour urinary nitrogen excretion decreased from 8.00 +/- 0.33 to 5.01 +/- 0.33 g (P less than 0.001), and sodium excretion decreased from 45.9 +/- 2.96 to 21.2 +/- 3.48 mmol/day (P less than 0.001). Serum calcium concentrations did not change, but serum inorganic phosphorus levels of 1.08 +/- 0.04 mmol/L at baseline increased significantly after rhGH treatment to 1.33 +/- 0.04 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). Increases were also observed in circulating PTH (53.2 +/- 6 vs. 39.5 +/- 4.2 ng/L; P less than 0.01) and calcitriol (82.8 vs. 65.8 pmol/L; P less than 0.05). A rise in serum osteocalcin (10.3 +/- .86 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05) was accompanied by increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline (628 +/- 63 vs. 406 +/- 44 mumol/day; P less than 0.01). Despite the reduction in sodium excretion, marked increases were observed in urinary calcium (6.04 +/- 0.97 vs. 3.27 +/- 0.40 mmol/day; P less than 0.01). rhGH significantly impaired oral glucose tolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity, but was otherwise well tolerated and produced no systematic changes in weight or blood pressure. The results of this study indicate that rhGH requires further study as a potential agent for attenuating or reversing the loss of muscle and bone in elderly people.\r"

AVP release was defined by 5% hypertonic saline infusion test in all patients, and urinary diluting capacity was estimated by the iv water-loading tests in five patients. Plasma AVP was measured by sensitive and specific RIA. The mean basal plasma AVP level in the patients (0.5 +/- 0.1 pmol/L) was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than that in normal adults (2.5 +/- 0.5 pmol/L). During hypertonic saline infusion, the rise in plasma AVP was normal or subnormal in all patients. In two patients who showed mild to moderate hyponatremia in the basal state and mild urinary diluting defect during water loading, plasma AVP was appropriately suppressed in each case. These results indicate that inappropriate elevation of plasma AVP is not common in myxedema, and that impaired water excretion is due mainly to AVP-independent mechanisms.\r"

The diagnosis of an estrogen-secreting adrenal tumor was made based upon the finding of a 4-cm left adrenal mass, elevated levels of estradiol in peripheral and left adrenal venous blood, and increased urinary 17-ketosteroids. In addition to marked elevations in estradiol and 17-ketosteroids there was an increased baseline level of 11-deoxycorticosterone and a slightly decreased level of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, suggesting the possibility of impaired P450c11 activity. The effect of ketoconazole administration (600 mg/day) for 4 weeks was studied. Urinary free cortisol and 17-ketosteroid excretion and serum testosterone levels fell acutely (1 week). Serum estradiol levels decreased gradually over the 4-week course. Plasma aldosterone levels were essentially unaltered and 18-hydroxcorticosterone levels fell gradually, but there were marked increases in 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone. Coincident with the increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone there was an increase in blood pressure and a transient fall in serum potassium. We conclude that ketoconazole administration may result in a hypermineralocorticoid state. Therefore, the usefulness of ketoconazole therapy for steroid hormone-producing neoplasms will depend upon the individual tumor's steroidogenic profile.\r"

Inhibin was released in well-defined pulses which coincided with episodes ot T release; both the duration and relative amplitude of inhibin and T pulses were similar. Inhibin pulses were undetectable in peripheral blood. These data suggest that the mechanism responsible for releasing T from the testis also stimulates inhibin release.

  ".U": "90130951\r", 
  ".W": "Previous data from this laboratory revealed a rapid (-12h) and unexpectedly long (-30 days) inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion after a single injection of Antide (Nal-Lys GnRH antagonist) in ovariectomized (OVX) monkeys. Although the apparent mechanism of action of Antide is competitive occupancy of GnRH receptors, the etiology of the prolonged action is unknown. Here, we report development of a radioreceptor assay to measure circulating Antide levels to determine the mechanism(s) of its long duration of action. Five long-term OVX monkeys were injected with Antide (3.0 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected daily for 30 days, and thereafter on alternate days until day 60. Following sc or iv Antide injection, peripheral luteinizing hormone (LH) levels declined from 281 +/- 19 ng/ml to 29 +/- 3 ng/ml within one day (P less than 0.05). LH levels slowly recovered to pretreatment levels within 35 +/- 7 days. Peripheral Antide levels were 16,531 +/- 4,432 ng/ml within 15 minutes following iv injection, and 52 +/- 21 ng/ml at 1 day after sc Antide injection. Interestingly, thereafter clearance of Antide-from the peripheral circulation was very slow, with an apparent t1/2 (second phase) of 6.5 days following iv administration. Detectable Antide levels were present in the peripheral circulation for more than one month in all five monkeys. In a second experiment, incubation of 125I-Tyro Antide with OVX monkey serum resulted in binding of the labelled peptide to serum proteins and reduction of 125I-Tyro Antide binding to pituitary receptors. Following gel permeation chromatography, greater than 70% of the radioactivity was associated with a 66 kDa protein(s). In conclusion, the prolonged duration of gonadotropin inhibition by Antide seems to derive from the long circulatory half-life of this molecule. In turn, this extended action of Antide may be manifest, at least in part, by binding to serum protein(s) that serves as a built-in peripheral depot release mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "90131093\r", 
  ".W": "Previous results (Weinberg, J. M., J. A. David, M. Abarzua, and T. Rajan. 1987. J. Clin. Invest. 80:1446-1454) have shown that GSH and glycine (GLY) are cytoprotective during anoxia when added extracellularly. The present studies investigate the role that intracellular GSH plays in this cytoprotection. Proximal renal tubules in suspension prepared with either high (11 +/- 1 nmol/mg protein) or low (6 +/- 1 nmol/mg protein) GSH contents were subjected to 40 min of anoxia and 40 min of reoxygenation. Low GSH tubules were protected from plasma membrane damage during anoxia by exogenous addition of 1 mM GSH or GLY, reducing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from 42 +/- 7 to 14 +/- 1 and 10 +/- 1%, respectively. High GSH tubules were equally protected from anoxic damage without exogenous additions. Since the high GSH content approximates the in vivo values, it may be concluded that GSH may be cytoprotective during anoxia in vivo. However, it is not the intracellular GSH itself that is cytoprotective; rather, this protection resides in the ability to produce GLY, which appears to be the cytoprotective agent. Alanine was also shown to have similar cytoprotective properties, although higher concentrations were required. Sulfhydryl reducing agents such as cysteine and dithiothreitol offered less, but significant protection from anoxic damage. Protection by GSH, GLY, or alanine was not associated with higher ATP levels during anoxia. Tubules that were protected from membrane damage during anoxia recovered oxygen consumption and K and ATP contents significantly better during reoxygenation than unprotected tubules.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies to a polymerase III transcription factor, La (SS-B), are frequently detected in the serum of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. To define the humoral immune response to this protein, we analyzed the patterns of antibody recognition toward 13 recombinant La peptides by immunoblotting and determined the heterogeneity of antibodies reactive with the immunodominant epitopes. The smallest epitopes that were strongly antigenic and recognized by greater than 70% of sera tested (immunodominant) were encoded by the subclones BgX and XA located in the 5' and 3' halves of the La cDNA, respectively. Conformation of the immunodominant La peptides played a major role in antibody recognition. Although greater diversity in antibody binding to carboxyl-terminal La peptides was observed, the overall pattern of peptide recognition by anti-La antibodies was similar in different diseases. The antibody responses to the immunodominant peptides were strongly correlated (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001). One- and two-dimensional isoelectric focusing of affinity purified IgG anti-La peptide antibodies revealed restricted heterogeneity and oligoclonal bands (kappa light chains). These observations suggest that anti-La antibodies are induced and/or maintained by the self antigen and that their diversity is constrained either by mechanisms related to tolerance or by affinity maturation of the humoral immune response.\r"

To establish an in vitro model of this disorder and examine the mechanism of the proximal tubule transport defect seen with elevated intracellular cystine concentrations, rabbit proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) were perfused in vitro. PCTs were loaded with cystine using cystine dimethyl ester, a permeative methyl ester derivative. Bath cystine dimethyl ester (0.5 mM) reduced volume absorption (Jv) (0.67 +/- 0.07 to 0.15 +/- 0.09 nl/mm.min, P less than 0.01), bicarbonate transport (JTCO2) (47.2 +/- 4.9 to 11.1 +/- 2.8 pmol/mm.min, P less than 0.001) and glucose transport (JGLU) (34.1 +/- 1.5 to 19.7 +/- 1.5 pmol/mm.min, P less than 0.001). The methyl esters of leucine (0.5 mM), and tryptophan (0.5 and 2.0 mM) had no effect on these parameters. To examine if intracellular reduction of cystine to cysteine could contribute to the inhibition in transport, the effect of bath cysteine methyl ester on proximal tubular transport was examined. Bath cysteine methyl ester (2 but not 0.5 mM) resulted in an inhibition in Jv, JGLU, and JTCO2. Cystine dimethyl ester had no effect on mannitol or bicarbonate permeability. These data are consistent with intracellular proximal tubular cystine accumulation resulting in an inhibition of active transport.\r"

  ".W": "The maturation of the neuromodulatory action of substance P (SP) was investigated in tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) segments isolated from rabbits aged 2-24 wk. The tissues were placed in baths containing Krebs-Ringer solution and contracted with electrical field stimulation (ES) with ES frequencies ranging from 1 to 75 Hz. In tissues greater than 1 mo of age, the ES frequency-response relationships were progressively shifted in the presence of a maximally effective neuromodulatory SP dose (10(-7) M) such that by 24 wk of age the mean (+/- SEM) maximal tension (Tmax) significantly increased from 380.4 (+/- 41.9) to 502.3 (+/- 64.2) g/g TSM, and the corresponding mean (+/- SEM) log ES frequency producing 50% of Tmax (log ES50) significantly decreased from 1.209 (+/- 0.069) to 1.055 (+/- 0.046) Hz. By contrast, relative to methacholine, the direct contractile effects of SP did not significantly vary with age. In further analyzing the basis for the above age-related difference in the neuromodulatory action of SP, we found that the magnitude of SP-induced neuromodulation was highly correlated to the tissue's intrinsic sensitivity to ES. Indeed, after accounting for the tissue's sensitivity to ES, the effect of age alone on the magnitude of SP-induced neuromodulation was not statistically significant. These findings provide new evidence that: (a) SP-induced neuromodulation of acetylcholine release at the airway neuromuscular junction is significantly enhanced during postnatal development; and (b) that the latter age-dependent action of SP is based on a close coupling of the magnitude of SP-induced neuromodulation to the tissue's intrinsic sensitivity to neurally mediated contraction.\r"

  ".W": "Attachment of pathogens to host cells is a prerequisite for the development of many infections. Pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia is characterized by attachment of PC trophozoites to the alveolar epithelium. The mechanism of this process is unknown. Fibronectin (Fn) is a glycoprotein present in the alveolar space known to mediate cell-cell attachment, including the attachment of certain pathogens to host epithelial cells. In this study the binding of Fn to PC trophozoites has been characterized in vitro using 125I-Fn. Fn binds saturably and specifically to 6.4 x 10(5) binding sites per organism with an apparent binding constant, Kd, of 1.2 x 10(-8) M. Fn binding to PC was inhibited by the addition of Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), a tetrapeptide containing the active site of the cell-binding domain of Fn. PC attachment to an alveolar epithelial cell line was quantified using 51Cr-labeled PC trophozoites. Attachment was decreased from 24 +/- 1.9% to 12.1 +/- 1% (P less than 0.01) by the addition of an anti-Fn antibody, an effect that could be overcome by the addition of excess free Fn. It is concluded that binding of Fn to PC may be an important initial step in the attachment of the organism to alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, it appears that PC recognizes and binds to the RGDS cell attachment site of Fn.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms leading to changes in activity, we measured cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass by RIA and CETP mRNA abundance by Northern and slot blot analysis using a human CETP cDNA probe in control (n = 8) and cholesterol-fed rabbits (n = 10). Cholesterol feeding (chow plus 0.5% cholesterol, 10% corn oil) for 30 d increased CETP mass in plasma 3.2-fold in the cholesterol-fed rabbits (12.45 +/- 0.82 micrograms/ml) compared with controls (3.86 +/- 0.38 micrograms/ml). In the hypercholesterolemic rabbit, liver CETP mRNA levels were increased 2.8 times control mRNA levels. Actin, apo E, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and albumin mRNA abundances were unchanged. In contrast to the widespread tissue distribution in humans, CETP mRNA was not detected in extrahepatic tissues of either control or cholesterol-fed animals. Using a sensitive RNase protection assay, the increase in liver CETP mRNA was detectable within 3 d of beginning the high cholesterol diet. Thus, in response to the atherogenic diet there is an early increase in liver CETP mRNA, probably causing increased CETP synthesis and secretion, and increased plasma CETP. The results indicate that the CETP gene may be regulated by diet-induced changes in lipid metabolism.\r"

We determined the sequence from -350 to 10 bp 5' of the G gamma and A gamma fetal globin genes from one beta s-containing chromosome on each of the three major haplotype backgrounds. The Senegal chromosome had a T at -158 5' to the G gamma gene; the Benin (BEN) chromosome had an A to G change at -309 5' to the G gamma gene; and the Central African Republic (CAR) chromosome had a C to T change at -271 5' to the A gamma gene. Genomic DNA from patients with sickle cell disease was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction and radiolabeled allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. The -309 G variant 5' to the G gamma gene is associated with BEN chromosomes, and the -271 T variant 5' to A gamma with CAR. The -309 change was also found on beta A-containing chromosomes, while the -271 change was not. The -309 change may have predated the beta s mutation on the BEN chromosome.\r"

This study demonstrates that the dihydropteroate synthase in T. gondii is kinetically distinct from the enzyme characterized from other sources and can be highly purified with a high yield using sequential dye-affinity chromatography. Conditions have been identified that allow for stabilization of the purified enzyme, and its physical characteristics have been elucidated. The molecular weight of the native protein was 125,000 and the protein appeared to contain both dihydropteroate synthase and 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase activities. The sulfonamide class of compounds vary in inhibitory potency by more than three orders of magnitude. Sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethazine, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50's) of 1.7, 2.7, and 5.7 microM, respectively, represent the most potent of this class of inhibitors. Several sulfone analogues, including dapsone, were identified as highly potent inhibitors with IC50's less than 1 microM. The results of these cell-free experiments were corroborated by investigating the metabolic inhibition produced by the various inhibitors in intact organisms. The qualitative and quantitative relations among the inhibitors were preserved in both the cell-free and intact cell assay systems. These studies suggest that the sulfones may be important therapeutic agents for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.\r"

The unexpected finding that a pentose instead of a hexose is involved in the crosslinking process suggested that the crosslink, named pentosidine, might provide insight into abnormalities of pentose metabolism in aging and disease. This hypothesis was investigated by quantitating pentosidine in hydrolysates of 103 human skin specimens obtained randomly at autopsy. Pentosidine level was found to increase exponentially from 5 to 75 pmol/mg collagen over lifespan (r = 0.86, P less than 0.001). A three- to tenfold increase was noted in insulin-dependent diabetic and nondiabetic subjects with severe end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (P less than 0.001). Moderately elevated levels were also noted in some very old subjects, some subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes, and two subjects with cystic fibrosis and diabetes. The cause of the abnormal pentose metabolism in these conditions is unknown but may relate to hemolysis, impaired pentose excretion, cellular stress, and accelerated breakdown of ribonucleotides. Thus, pentosidine emerges as a useful tool for assessment of previously unrecognized disorders of pentose metabolism in aging and disease. Its presence in red blood cells and plasma proteins suggests that it might be used as a measure of integrated pentosemia in analogy to glycohemoglobin for the assessment of cumulative glycemia.\r"

The mechanisms responsible for ethanol-associated inhibition of liver regeneration are poorly understood. To determine if the antiregenerative effects of ethanol involve modulation of polyamine metabolism, parameters of polyamine synthesis were compared before and during surgically induced liver regeneration in ethanol-fed rats and isocalorically maintained controls. After partial hepatectomy, induction of the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis, was delayed in rats that had been fed ethanol. This was correlated with reduced levels of putrescine, ODC's immediate product. Increases in hepatic spermidine and spermine were also inhibited. Differences in ODC activity between ethanol-fed and control rats could not be explained by differences in the expression of ODC mRNA or by differences in ODC apoenzyme concentrations, suggesting that chronic ethanol intake inactivates ODC posttranslationally. Supplemental putrescine, administered at partial hepatectomy and 4 and 8 h thereafter, increased hepatic putrescine concentrations and markedly improved DNA synthesis and liver regeneration in ethanol-fed rats. These data suggest that altered polyamine metabolism may contribute to the inhibition of liver regeneration that occurs after chronic exposure to ethanol.\r"

Current concepts suggest that attachment of P. carinii to alveolar epithelium is required for development of pneumonia. We examined the mechanism of P. carinii adherence to cultured A549 cells, a permanent cell line derived from human alveolar epithelium. P. carinii adherence was quantified by measuring attachment of 51Cr-labeled P. carinii to cultured A549 cells. After 8 h of incubation, 37.4 +/- 4.2% of P. carinii were adherent to A549 cells. In the presence of agents known to impair cytoskeletal function, including 10(-5) M cytochalasin B, 10(-5) M colchicine, and 10(-5) M trimethylcolchicinic acid (TMCA), adherence was decreased from 57.4 +/- 4.2% to 9.3 +/- 3.4%, 12.5 +/- 3.6%, and 21.5 +/- 3.6%, respectively (P less than 0.01, all comparisons). Secondly, we examined the effect of P. carinii on the function of A549 cells. P. carinii resulted in significant impairment of A549 cell growth, indicating P. carinii adversely affected the function of target lung cells. A P. carinii:A549 cell ratio of 50:1 resulted in 43.5 +/- 2.9% inhibition of A549 cell growth (P less than 0.001). Additionally, TMCA, which significantly prevented attachment of P. carinii, reversed the impairment of A549 cell growth. These data demonstrate that P. carinii attachment to cultured lung cells can be quantified, is dependent on intact cytoskeletal function and is necessary for impairment of lung cell replication.\r"

Chylomicron d6-tocopherol concentrations were similar in the two groups. d6-Tocopherol concentrations of plasma, very low (VLDL), low (LDL), and high (HDL) density lipoproteins were similar in the two groups only during the first 12 h; then these were significantly lower, and the rate of disappearance faster, in the patients. The times (tmax) of the maximum chylomicron d6-tocopherol concentrations were similar for the two groups, but tmax values in the controls increased in the order: chylomicrons less than VLDL less than or equal to LDL approximately HDL, while the corresponding values in the patients were similar to the chylomicron tmax. Thus, plasma d6-tocopherol in controls increased during chylomicron and VLDL catabolism, whereas in patients it increased only during chylomicron catabolism, thereby resulting in a premature and faster decline in the plasma tocopherol concentration due to a lack of d6-tocopherol secretion from the liver. We suggest that these patients are lacking or have a defective liver \"tocopherol binding protein\" that incorporates alpha-tocopherol into nascent VLDL.\r"

Stimulation of intact neutrophils with nanomolar concentrations of FMLP, leukotriene B4, 10-100 U/ml of tumor necrosis factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor resulted in parallel release of tetranectin and translocation of alkaline phosphatase to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, intracellular pools of tetranectin and latent alkaline phosphatase were completely released from neutrophils under conditions that barely induced release of specific granules containing B12-binding protein. These findings indicate that tetranectin and latent alkaline phosphatase define an easily mobilizable population of cytoplasmic storage organelles in human neutrophils which are functionally distinguishable from azurophil, specific, and gelatinase-containing granules. These organelles may play an important role as stores of membrane proteins that are mobilized to the cell surface during stimulation by inflammatory mediators.\r"

Using a rat cRNA probe to angiotensinogen, we demonstrated angiotensinogen mRNA to be localized predominantly in the proximal renal tubule, with considerably lesser amounts in distal tubular segments and glomerular tufts. Previous studies have localized renin immunoreactivity to the juxtaglomerular cells, glomerular tufts, and proximal tubules. Such findings provide further evidence for a local tissue renin angiotensin system within the kidney which may influence regional function. Based on our data, we hypothesize that a major site of angiotensin production is the proximal tubule. We postulate that angiotensin synthesized in and/or around the proximal tubule may directly modulate tubular transport of sodium, bicarbonate, and water. In addition to the proximal tubule, the specific localization of the renin angiotensin components elsewhere in the kidney would also support the other proposed regional functions of the intrarenal system, including modulation of tubuloglomerular balance.\r"

Because oils enriched in such fatty acids reduce inflammation and tissue injury in vivo, we examined the effects of these PGE precursors on IL-2-driven growth of human T lymphocytes. Dihomogamma linoleic acid (DGLA), AA, and their metabolites (PGE1 and PGE2, respectively) strongly inhibited short- and long-term growth of IL-2-dependent T cell cultures; EPA was much less inhibitory and its product, PGE3, failed to suppress IL-2 responses. Short-term pretreatment of the cells with DGLA or AA and removal of the fatty acids before the proliferation assay resulted in a smaller reduction in [3H]TdR incorporation. PGE and fatty acids did not alter the number of high affinity IL-2 binding sites on the T cell cultures but reduced the percentage of cells expressing CD25 and HLA class II molecules. No PGE was detected in supernatants from the fatty acid-treated cultures. Moreover, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, did not reverse the antiproliferative effects of the fatty acids. Together, these findings indicate that fatty acids can inhibit IL-2-driven T cell growth via a PGE-independent mechanism and might be relevant to inflammatory diseases associated with persistent T cell activation.\r"

In this report we describe the purification from several normal human hearts (including a very fresh, nonischemic sample) of heparin-binding, acid-, heat- and trypsin-sensitive 14-18-kD peptides that crossreact with antisera against aFGF and bFGF. Further evidence includes (a) prevention of mitogenicity by protamine and by anti-bFGF, (b) displacement of 125I-bFGF from cell membranes, and (c) stimulation of capillary endothelial cell migration. Specific immunohistochemistry localized bFGF to endothelial cells and, surprisingly, to cardiac myocytes, with almost no immunoreactivity in smooth muscle cells. These peptides may function in cardiac embryogenesis, hypertrophy, atherogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing, and may also have endocrine, neurotropic, or vasomotor functions.\r"

  ".W": "The current studies were undertaken to explore the relationship between enhanced sympathetic nervous activity and lymphocyte subset distribution in three settings: congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise, and beta-adrenergic agonist treatment. We compared the number and subset distribution of circulating lymphocytes in 36 patients with congestive heart failure and 31 age-matched control subjects. The number of circulating lymphocytes was lower in heart failure than in control. This was due to a reduction in Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells without significant alteration of Thelper cells. The extent of the alteration was similar in patients with idiopathic and ischemic heart failure, but the reduction was more pronounced in patients with New York Heart Association class III-IV than in class I-II. The plasma catecholamine elevation in heart failure was also independent of etiology but more pronounced in the more severely ill patients. We also assessed lymphocyte subsets after acute stimulation of sympathetic activity by dynamic exercise and after treatment with the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutaline. Dynamic exercise until exhaustion increased the number of circulating lymphocytes in healthy controls and heart failure patients in a subset-selective manner. By contrast, a 7-d treatment with terbutaline caused a reduction in the circulating number of lymphocytes in some subsets that was identical to that seen in heart failure patients. We conclude that prolonged sympathetic activity reduces the number of circulating lymphocytes by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Such alterations might be involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure and other disease states involving increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-Jo-1 antibodies (AJoA), which bind to and inhibit the activity of histidyl-transfer RNA synthetase (HRS), are found in a genetically and clinically distinct subset of myositis patients. This specificity suggests that understanding the antigenic epitopes and immunoregulation governing the production of AJoA may result in clues to disease pathogenesis. Limited digestion of human HRS by V8 protease resulted in four major antigenic polypeptides of 35, 34, 21, and 20 kD; digestion with subtilisin gave four fragments of the same sizes and two additional major antigenic polypeptides of 28 and 17 kD. Sera from 12 AJoA positive patients reacted indistinguishably with these proteolytic fragments by Western blotting, and AJoA elution studies suggested a common epitope(s) on all six. Isoelectric focusing showed a different polyclonal pattern of AJoA in each patient, although serial analyses in individual patients revealed stable AJoA spectrotypes over years of observation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the AJoA response was mainly restricted to the IgG1 heavy chain isotype. The levels of IgG1 AJoA varied in proportion to disease activity over time but were independent of total IgG1 levels, and three patients became AJoA negative as their myositis remitted after treatment. These findings suggest that AJoA are induced by an antigen-driven mechanism, bind to a common epitope or epitopes on HRS, and are modulated by an immune response closely linked to that which is responsible for myositis in these patients.\r"

We observed three distinct ion channel currents: (a) a voltage-dependent K+ current, (b) a Ca2(+)-activated K+ current, and (c) a Ca2(+)-activated Cl- current. The voltage-dependent K+ current was found in cells at rest. Its conductive properties suggested an inwardly rectifying channel. The channel was activated at membrane potentials more positive than -60 mV, suggesting that it may determine the resting membrane potential of neutrophils. Activation of neutrophils by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin led to an increase in whole-cell K+ and Cl- currents. The Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel differed from the voltage-dependent K+ channel because it was insensitive to voltage, because it rectified outwardly, and because the voltage-sensitive K+ channel was Ca2(+)-independent. The Ca2(+)-activated Cl- channel showed outward rectification and no apparent voltage dependency. The Ca2(+)-activated K+ and Cl- channels may play a role in cell volume homeostasis and/or cellular activation.\r"

To test whether cardiac muscle might be a target for regulation by peptide growth factors, the effect of three growth factors on the actin and myosin gene families was investigated by Northern blot analysis in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1, 1 ng/ml) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF, 25 ng/ml) elicited changes corresponding to those induced by hemodynamic load. The \"fetal\" beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) was up-regulated about four-fold, whereas the \"adult\" alpha MHC was inhibited greater than 50-60%; expression of alpha-skeletal actin increased approximately two-fold, with little or no change in alpha-cardiac actin. Thus, peptide growth factors alter the program of differentiated gene expression in cardiac myocytes, and are sufficient to provoke fetal contractile protein gene expression, characteristic of pressure-overload hypertrophy. Acidic FGF (25 ng/ml) produced seven- to eightfold reciprocal changes in MHC expression but, unlike either TGF-beta 1 or basic FGF, inhibited both striated alpha-actin genes by 70-90%. Expression of vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin, the earliest alpha-actin induced during cardiac myogenesis, was increased by all three growth factors. Thus, three alpha-actin genes demonstrate distinct responses to acidic vs. basic FGF.\r"

The results of this analysis indicate that antibody responses to four different La fragments vary in parallel over time. This finding is supported by a statistical analysis indicating that the changes in antibody levels between the six pairs of responses were highly correlated (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, we show by immunoaffinity purification that antibodies to the three nonoverlapping La protein fragments do not cross-react with other fragments and, hence, represent independent populations. These results suggest that anti-La antibodies are coordinately produced to different epitopes on the La molecule, possibly reflecting an antigen-driven mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of enalapril on glomerular hemodynamics and permselectivity and on subsequent sclerosis was studied in male MWF/Ztm rats which spontaneously develop proteinuria and glomerular structural damage. Untreated group 1 and enalapril-treated group 2 (50 mg/liter, in the drinking water) underwent micropuncture studies after 2 mo of observation. After the same period of treatment, group 3 (untreated) and group 4 (enalapril treated) were used for determination of whole-kidney function and neutral dextran clearances. Group 5 (untreated) and group 6 (enalapril treated) were followed for an additional 4 mo and used for kidney function and morphological studies. Enalapril significantly lowered systolic blood pressure, which was elevated in untreated groups, and significantly reduced proteinuria (295 +/- 64 vs. 128 +/- 24 mg/24 h by the end of the study). Despite the reduced renal perfusion pressure, whole-kidney glomerular filtration rate was higher in enalapril-treated than in untreated rats (0.96 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.10 ml/min, P less than 0.05) as was the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (54 +/- 7.1 vs. 46 +/- 4.0 nl/min, P less than 0.05). The single glomerular afferent plasma flow was comparable in both groups. Enalapril reduced mean glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure from the normal value of 51 +/- 1 mmHg (untreated rats) to a value lower than normal (44 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.001). These hemodynamic changes were associated with a significant reduction in afferent (approximately 23%) and efferent (approximately 26%) arteriolar resistance. The mean ultrafiltration coefficient was two times higher in the enalapril (0.126 +/- 0.027 nl/s per mmHg) than in the untreated group (0.061 +/- 0.023 nl/s per mmHg). The clearance of dextran macromolecules relative to that of inulin was significantly reduced for all molecular sizes studied (26-64 A) in enalapril-treated vs. untreated rats. Theoretical analysis of dextran fractional clearances using a heteroporous model of neutral solute transport across the glomerular capillary wall indicated that enalapril affected glomerular membrane size selective properties, reducing uniformly the radius of hypothetical membrane pores. Enalapril treatment also significantly limited (P less than 0.01) the development of glomerular structural lesions (mean percentage of sclerotic glomeruli was 4.2 +/- 3.5% [treated] vs. 28 +/- 15% [untreated] rats at the end of the study) as well as tubulo-interstitial damage. These results suggest that the protective effect of enalapril on the development of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in this model is due to its property of ameliorating size selectivity and hydraulic permeability of the glomerular capillaries.\r"

Low concentrations of HOCl (10-20 microM) caused oxidation of plasma membrane sulfhydryls determined as decreased binding of iodoacetylated phycoerythrin. These same low concentrations of HOCl caused disturbance of various plasma membrane functions: they inactivated glucose and aminoisobutyric acid uptake, caused loss of cellular K+, and an increase in cell volume. It is likely that these changes were the consequence of plasma membrane SH-oxidation, since similar effects were observed with para-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (pCMBS), a sulfhydryl reagent acting at the cell surface. Given in combination pCMBS and HOCl showed an additive effect. Higher doses of HOCl (greater than 50 microM) led to general oxidation of -SH, methionine and tryptophan residues, and formation of protein carbonyls. HOCl-induced loss of ATP and undegraded NAD was closely followed by cell lysis. In contrast, NAD degradation and ATP depletion caused by H2O2 preceded cell death by several hours. Formation of DNA strand breaks, a major factor of H2O2-induced injury, was not observed with HOCl. Thus targets of HOCl were distinct from those of H2O2 with the exception of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which was inactivated by both oxidants.\r"

  ".W": "Proteinaceous cast formation in the distal nephron of the kidney from low molecular weight proteinuria is a significant, but poorly characterized, cause of renal failure. To study this phenomenon, we: (a) microperfused the loop segment (LS) of rats in vivo with artificial tubule fluid (ATF) containing four different low molecular weight proteins, 0.01-50 mg/ml, to detect alterations in LS function, and (b) examined the interaction between several proteins and Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) in vitro with turbidity and dynamic light-scattering measurements. Perfusion of the LS for less than 2 min with cast-forming proteins (Bence Jones protein [BJP3] and myoglobin) decreased chloride absorption and elevated early distal tubule fluid (ED) [Cl-], compared with results obtained with control perfusions that used ATF alone. BJP3 decreased chloride absorption in a concentration-dependent fashion. Perfusion with non-cast-forming proteins (albumin and BJP1) enhanced chloride absorption and decreased ED [Cl-]. In vitro, proteins that had isoelectric points (pI) greater than 5.1 aggregated with THP. Aggregation was enhanced with increasing [NaCl] or [CaCl2]. Albumin (pI 4.8) and beta-lactoglobulin (pI 5.1) did not coprecipitate. The molecular size of THP alone increased when [NaCl] greater than 80 mM. Thus, cast-forming proteins aggregated with THP in vitro and caused in vivo LS dysfunction, which elevated ED [Cl-], facilitating aggregation. In contrast, non-cast-forming proteins either did not interact with THP or lowered ED [Cl-], which did not provide an environment for aggregation. Altered LS function and interaction of some proteins with THP were related to different physicochemical properties of the proteins and independently contributed to the formation of proteinaceous casts in the kidney.\r"

To determine if prostaglandins are involved, we administered human recombinant IL-1 beta and measured rectal PGE2 production in rabbits with formalin-immune complex colitis. IL-1 beta (0.3 micrograms/kg) administered 24 h before induction of colitis increased PGE2 (231 +/- 36 to 1,299 +/- 572 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) and reduced subsequent inflammatory cell infiltration index (from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.4 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.02) and edema (from 2.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.3 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.01) compared with vehicle-matched animals. Administration of ibuprofen (10 mg/kg i.v.) together with IL-1 beta prevented the stimulation of PGE2 and the reduction in inflammation. Colonic PGE2 production correlated inversely with subsequent severity of inflammation (P less than 0.02, r = -0.39) and edema (P less than 0.04, r = -0.35). IL-1-administration 30 min before induction of colitis did not affect the severity of inflammation. Similarly, pretreatment with a noninflammatory synthetic peptide (fragment 163-171) of human IL-1 beta, either 30 min or 24 h before colitis induction, did not reduce inflammation or increase prostaglandin synthesis. These data demonstrate that pretreatment with IL-1 beta 24 h before the induction of colitis reduces inflammation by a mechanism that requires prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

Culture supernatants were tested for TNF/cachectin activity by L929 cell cytotoxicity assay, and TNF/cachectin mRNA was assessed by a sensitive PCR amplification technique that could detect between 1 and 10 cells fully activated for TNF/cachectin expression. Unstimulated MDM cultures produced no detectable levels of TNF/cachectin activity or mRNA, consistent with previous demonstrations that production of this cytokine by macrophages is an inducible and not a constitutive event. HIV-1 infection failed to induce detectable TNF/cachectin activity or mRNA in these unstimulated cultures. In addition, the responsiveness of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of TNF/cachectin production was assessed in dose-response and kinetic experiments. No differences between infected and uninfected cultures were discernable.

Direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) using antiserum against rat urinary kallikrein detected a glandular kallikrein-like enzyme (GKLE) in VSM cells and in media. VSM homogenates and culture media had kininogenase activity, generating kinins from dog kininogen. About half of the GKLE was enzymatically inactive which could be activated with trypsin. Kininogenase activity was inhibited completely by aprotinin but only 20% by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). Trypsin liberated kinins from homogenates and media, demonstrating that VSM cells contain kininogen. Homogenates and media rapidly degrade bradykinin. GKLE, kininogen, and bradykininase activity were all present in VSM cells grown in defined media that contain no serum, thus eliminating any contamination or artefacts from fetal calf serum in standard culture media. Blood vessels of the rat have been reported to contain GKLE. Our observations indicate that GKLE is synthesized by VSM cells, not deposited from plasma. Furthermore, VSM cells synthesize kininogen and bradykininase(s), the other key elements of the glandular kallikrein-kinin system. Thus it is possible that the system functions as an autocoid mechanism that regulates local vascular tone.\r"

Two hundred and seventeen (8.4%) patients had an undetectable TSH concentration, and of these 39 (18%) had otherwise normal thyroid hormone concentrations and no history of thyroid disease. In a follow up study 71 patients (34 outpatients and 37 inpatients) with undetectable TSH concentration associated with otherwise normal thyroid hormone concentrations were randomly selected during routine reporting of thyroid function test results. None of these patients had a history of thyroid disease. Sex hormone binding globulin concentrations were increased in five out of 50 of these patients and antithyroid antibodies were detectable in four out of 49, suggesting that in most cases the isolated undetectable TSH concentration was not associated with thyroid dysfunction, particularly hyperthyroidism. Isolated undetectable TSH concentration was observed in both inpatients and outpatients and was not associated with any particular clinical condition. Repeat specimens were received in 54 of the 71 patients and TSH concentration remained persistently undetectable in 35 of these.\r"

Seven who died and six survivors had signs of hyperfibrinolysis: factor VII activity differentiated the two groups independently of the presence of hyperfibrinolysis. The presence of hyperfibrinolysis significantly reduced prekallikrein activity, which did not differentiate clearly survivors from non-survivors. Long term follow up of survivors showed a good correlation between factor VII and prekallikrein activities with long term survival. Hyperfibrinolysis seemed to influence the clinical course of patients: 87% of patients with hyperfibrinolysis who died had fatal haemorrhagic episodes. Low factor VII activity may be a precursor of terminal liver insufficiency.\r"

The clearance of 59Fe-labelled transferrin from the plasma was analysed to quantify total, effective, and ineffective erythropoiesis, denoted by the terms marrow iron turnover (MIT), red cell iron turnover (RCIT), and per cent ineffective iron turnover (IIT%), respectively, in 12 cases of this disease. The patterns obtained were variable: values for MIT ranged from 24.4 to 510 mumol/l blood/day; those for RCIT from 0.4 to 119 mumol/l blood/day; and those for IIT% from 67 to 98%. One noteworthy feature was the presence in two cases of functional erythroid hypoplasia; these were characterised by severely reduced values for MIT (24.4 and 28 mumol/l blood/day) and RCIT (0.4 and 8 mumol/l blood/day.) A systematic study of the erythrokinetic features of myelofibrosis may indicate that erythroid hypoplasia is a more common cause of anaemia in this disease than has been previously recognised.\r"

The outcome of 72 episodes of neutropenic fever was determined and correlated with the presence or absence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Twenty four patients had mucocutaneous HSV infection during at least one episode. In 24 episodes in which HSV was isolated only 12.5% of fevers responded to antibiotics and 75% of fevers were otherwise unexplained. Conversely, in 48 episodes of neutropenic fever in which HSV was not isolated 67% of fevers responded to antibiotics and only 8.3% were unexplained. The difference in incidence of antibiotic resistant fever in the two groups was significant. There was, therefore, a strong association between mucocutaneous HSV infection and antibiotic resistant fever in immunosuppressed neutropenic patients. As most HSV infections are the result of virus reactivation, establishing the HSV serological state of patients would identify those at risk of infection and hence those in whom the prophylactic use of acyclovir would be indicated.\r"

In the latter group whether there were associations between degree and activity of gastritis and the prevalence of lymphoid follicles and between the occurrence of lymphoid follicles and the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the antrum were investigated. In cases with normal mucosa and in those with reflux gastritis lymphoid follicles were not detected, but mucosal lymphoid follicles were found in 1297 (54%) of the cases with C pylori-associated gastritis. The prevalence of lymphoid follicles in the antral mucosa depended on the degree and activity of the gastritis and also correlated with the presence of intestinal metaplasia. The development of lymphoid follicles in the mucosa of the antrum probably represents, primarily, an immune response to the colonisation of the mucosa by C pylori.\r"

Electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions showed immunoreactive fragments of apparent masses of 55,000 and 140,000 daltons, respectively. Analysis under reducing conditions did not result in loss of activity. CA 125 antigen is thought to be a high molecular weight glycoprotein complex.

There were no significant differences between AgNOR counts in transitional areas and areas remote from adenocarcinoma in situ, and between these areas and histologically normal cervices.

An antibody capture ELISA developed at our laboratory was used as the reference test. An IgM immunoblotting assay was also performed. Four (Toxoplasma IgM EIA, Tox-M EIA, Toxonostika M, and Platelia Toxo IgM) of the commercial IgM ELISAs gave a high sensitivity and a high specificity. Toxo-M EIA, Toxonostika M, Toxoplasma IgM EIA and the Toxo M Enzyme Immunoassay were too insensitive, and the Toxoplasma gondii IgM ELISA was both insensitive and unspecific. No remarkable differences were observed between the results of indirect or antibody capture ELISAs, and between the results of ELISAs performed with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies.\r"

The ISAGA was found to be more sensitive than DS-ELISA but there was no demonstrable difference in the specificity or reproducibility between the two assays. The ISAGA is suitable for the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients and as a screening test for recent infection in pregnant women. The persistence of ISAGA reactivity, however, is such that additional serological assessment is required to define the risk of congenital infection.\r"

Bone marrows were cultured from forty eight subjects, including normal controls and patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Observer error was least with the disc cultures, whereas variation between replicate cultures was similar for both methods. A high degree of correlation was found between the two methods for both day 7 (r = 0.90) and day 14 (r = 0.91) cultures. The number of colonies and clusters was higher with the disc system, indicating better cloning efficiency. Analysis of subsets of clinical groups showed similar patterns of abnormality with both systems. The simplicity of the method makes the use of this technology possible in most laboratories, and the superior morphological resolution may increase the clinical usefulness of such studies.\r"

Skin involvement was the first sign of cancer in 59 patients (0.8%); 22 had direct extension of their tumor into the skin, 20 had local metastases, and 17 had distal metastases. Direct invasion was most common with breast cancer and second most common with oral cavity cancer. Local metastases were also most frequently caused by breast cancer but occurred in surgical scars in three women with pelvic cancer and in perianal abscesses in one patient with rectal carcinoma as well. Except for metastases from unknown primary sites, distant metastases were rare as presenting signs, and their origins were widely distributed. Our data show that internal cancer uncommonly presents with skin involvement. Nevertheless, an index of suspicion should be maintained and biopsy performed, particularly for nonhealing ulcers, persistent indurated erythema, and unexplained skin nodules.\r"

Salient clinical features included a sclerodermatous facial appearance, cordlike thickening of superficial blood vessels, neck skin resembling that in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, livedo reticularis-like changes on the trunk, Raynaud's phenomenon, arterial and venous thromboses, and the nephrotic syndrome. Amyloid deposits were present in the dermis, around appendages, in blood vessel walls, and in a striking distribution surrounding individual elastic fibers, that appeared shortened and fragmented. Immunofluorescence, electron microscopic, and immunoultrastructural studies with antibodies to lambda light chain, localized the amyloid deposits to the region of the elastic fiber microfibrils, with which amyloid P component (AP) is invariably associated in normal tissues. Because AP binds amyloid fibrils, codistribution of amyloid deposits and AP in amyloid elastosis strongly supports the theory that elastic fiber-associated AP may act as a nidus for amyloid deposition.\r"

Fifty-seven floral workers were surveyed, and 15 (26%) reported hand dermatitis within the previous 12 months. Sixteen floral workers (eight with dermatitis) volunteered to be patch tested to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group Standard and Perfume Trays, a series of eight pesticides and 20 plant allergens. Of four of seven floral designers and arrangers who reported hand dermatitis, three reacted positively to patch tests to tuliposide A, the allergen in Alstroemeria. Patch test readings for all other plant extracts were negative. A positive reading for a test to one pesticide, difolatan (Captafol), was noted, the relevance of which is unknown.\r"

Our observations suggest that (1) dysplastic melanocytic nevi may aggregate in families of persons who have dysplastic melanocytic nevi or melanoma, even in the absence of a family history of dysplastic melanocytic nevi or melanoma and (2) formal genetic and natural history studies of persons who have dysplastic melanocytic nevi outside the familial melanoma setting are warranted.\r"

This study compares the findings in 30 hirsute women with normal menses and those of 30 hirsute women with abnormal cycles. Of the women with abnormal menstruation, 73% had oligoamenorrhea only and the others had dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The abnormally menstruating group had a similar mean age but tended to have heavier body weights than those with normal cycles. Free and total testosterone levels were significantly higher in the abnormal group (total testosterone, 54 +/- 35 ng/dl vs 35 +/- 12 ng/dl, p = 0.004; free testosterone, 7.8 +/- 4.9 pg/ml vs 4.2 +/- 1.4 pg/ml, p = 0.002). The abnormal group tended to have higher levels of androstenedione than the normal group (227 +/- 116 ng/dl vs 139 +/- 59 ng/dl) but dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels were similar (320 +/- 142 mg/dl vs 298 +/- 169 pg/dl). Levels of thyroxin, thyrotropin, and prolactin were comparable in the two groups. Among hirsute women those with abnormal menses tended to be heavier and to have higher levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione. This is consistent with the clinical impression, not previously documented, that of hirsute women, those with abnormal menses have more severe endocrine abnormalities than those with normal cycles.\r"

The disease was diagnosed in patients in all risk groups and was categorized in all classes of the Walter Reed classification without significant differences in prevalence. Epstein-Barr virus could be demonstrated in all tissue samples examined; human papillomavirus was found in only a few specimens. In our series oral hairy leukoplakia had a chronic course, although temporary spontaneous healing occurred in some cases. Its appearance was a poor prognostic sign because acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in a significant proportion of patients within a few months of onset.\r"

In all patients with localized and segmental lesions and in seven with generalized lesions, successful repigmentation without scarring was observed at the grafted sites approximately 2 to 3 weeks after grafting, and a subsequent two- to threefold expansion of the pigmented area occurred within 3 to 4 months. On the other hand, no repigmentation could be achieved in four patients with generalized vitiligo in whom depigmentation (i.e., the Koebner phenomenon) occurred at the donor sites. Our results suggest that the Koebner phenomenon occurs in an all-or-none pattern only in patients with generalized vitiligo. Thus, although epidermal grafting is a simple and useful method, successful repigmentation at the recipient sites depends on the selection of patients with localized lesions in whom the Koebner phenomenon does not develop.\r"

Their use has been controversial because of inconsistent reports about efficacy and concern about safety. We investigated the dose-response relationship for suppression of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) with the use of dexamethasone. Thirty women with an initial DHEAS value of greater than or equal to 300 micrograms/dl were studied. All had cystic or inflammatory acne, hirsutism, or androgenic alopecia. Dexamethasone was given as a single bedtime dosage of 0.125, 0.250, or 0.375 mg. Mean dosage required for suppression was 0.256 mg daily. Suppression of the DHEAS level to less than or equal to 200 micrograms/dl was achieved with 0.125 mg in 25% of women, 0.250 mg in an additional 50%, and 0.375 mg in a further 20%. Most patients were taking spironolactone when the study was performed. Effective suppression is attained with dexamethasone doses significantly lower than previously thought. Use of these doses was not associated with a significant incidence of adverse effects.\r"

Biopsy specimens obtained on day 5, before any clinical improvement, revealed a significant reduction of epidermal DR+CD1- antigen-presenting cells, epidermal and dermal monocytes, and keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. By day 5 the stratum corneum reverted to normal in the plaques receiving cyclosporine. Pain at the injection site was the major side effect. Steady-state blood cyclosporine levels ranged from 20 to 30 ng/ml during the first 12 hours after injection and became undetectable at 48 hours. These data suggest that cyclosporine improves the skin of patients with psoriasis by a local mechanism of action.\r"

Only the 50% Scl solution failed to produce clinical or histologic thrombosis at 1 hour. Clinical fading was observed in STS-treated vessels at 10 days postinjection. Histologically, early thrombus formation with focal endothelial necrosis was replaced by fibrosis and microangiopathic recanalization. Although undiluted Scl caused similar, yet milder histologic findings, luminal recanalization after 10 days resulted in a clinically unfaded vessel. The use of 50% Scl produced no endothelial damage with no subsequent change in vessel appearance. Cutaneous necrosis or extravasation of erythrocytes was not observed.\r"

However, the independent risk carried by nonfatal reinfarction for subsequent cardiac death has not been quantified. The prognostic significance of nonfatal reinfarction was determined from the multicenter diltiazem trial data base of 1,234 patients treated with placebo followed up for 1 to 4 years after acute myocardial infarction. One hundred sixteen patients had at least one nonfatal reinfarction, 14 (12%) of whom subsequently experienced cardiac death. Of the remaining 1,118 patients without nonfatal reinfarction, 110 (9.8%) experienced cardiac death. Compared with event-free patients, patients with nonfatal reinfarction were more likely (p less than 0.05) to be women, to have had an infarction before their index event and to have had prior cardiac-related symptoms. Cox survivorship analyses, using pertinent baseline clinical variables along with nonfatal reinfarction as a time-dependent predictor variable, revealed that nonfatal reinfarction carried a significant and independent risk for subsequent cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 3.0, p = 0.002), which was greater than that carried by other significant predictor variables (New York Heart Association functional class, pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph, blood urea nitrogen level, predischarge Holter-recorded ventricular premature complexes and radionuclide ejection fraction). The cardiac mortality risk associated with nonfatal reinfarction was further increased in patients whose index event was their first infarction (hazard ratio 5.4, p = 0.0006). Thus, nonfatal reinfarction carries a strong, significant and independent risk for subsequent cardiac death in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Exercise tests were performed before angioplasty and at 3 days and 1, 3 and 6 months after angioplasty; if the test was positive, it was repeated after administration of 10 mg of intravenous verapamil. At arteriography 6 months after coronary angioplasty, 17 patients (group 1) showed no restenosis but 14 patients (group 2) did. Before angioplasty all 31 patients had a positive exercise test with ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm. At 3 days after angioplasty, three patients in group 1 had a positive exercise test compared with 11 patients in group 2 (p = 0.08). At 1, 3 and 6 months, 1 patient in group 1 had a positive exercise test compared with 14 patients in group 2 (p less than 0.01). The heart rate-blood pressure product (beats/min.mm Hg) calculated at 1 mm ST segment depression, or at peak exercise if the test was negative, was used as an index of the ischemic threshold. In group 1 (no restenosis) the ischemic threshold increased progressively from 14,840 +/- 1,075 (mean value +/- SEM) before angioplasty to 21,210 +/- 1,049 at 3 days and to 25,140 +/- 1,177 (p less than 0.001) at 6 months.

  ".W": "In a selected subgroup of 50 survivors of cardiac arrest, the impact of surgical myocardial revascularization on inducible arrhythmias, arrhythmia recurrence and long-term survival was examined. The effects of several clinical, angiographic and electrophysiologic variables on arrhythmia recurrence and survival were also analyzed. All patients had a prehospital cardiac arrest and severe operable coronary artery disease and underwent myocardial revascularization. Preoperative electrophysiologic study was performed in 41 patients; 33 (80%) had inducible ventricular arrhythmias. Of 42 patients studied off antiarrhythmic drugs postoperatively, 19 (45%) had inducible ventricular arrhythmias. Thirty patients with inducible arrhythmias preoperatively underwent postoperative testing off antiarrhythmic drugs; arrhythmia induction was suppressed in 14 (47%). By multivariate analysis, the induction of ventricular fibrillation at the preoperative electrophysiologic study was the only significant predictor of induced ventricular arrhythmia suppression by coronary surgery (p less than 0.001). Inducible ventricular fibrillation was not present postoperatively in any of the 11 patients who manifested this arrhythmia preoperatively. In contrast, inducible ventricular tachycardia persisted in 80% of patients in whom preoperative testing induced this arrhythmia. Patients were followed up for 39 +/- 29 months. There were four arrhythmia recurrences; one was fatal. There were three nonsudden cardiac deaths and three noncardiac deaths. By life-table analysis, 5 year survival, cardiac survival and arrhythmia-free survival rates were 88%, 98%, and 88%, respectively. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and advanced age were predictive of death (p = 0.015 and 0.026, respectively) and cardiac death (p = 0.037 and 0.05, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The arrhythmia lasted less than 1 min in all five patients, converting spontaneously in four and requiring electrical cardioversion in one. Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 4.4% of women (4 of 90) and 0.3% of men (1 of 301) (p less than 0.0025). Only one of the patients with ventricular tachycardia had coronary artery disease. To determine whether other clinical or procedural factors predispose patients to this side effect of papaverine, these 5 patients were compared with 25 control patients who were matched for gender and extent of coronary artery disease. The following variables were analyzed: age, baseline serum potassium and calcium levels, left ventricular ejection fraction, baseline heart rate, mean arterial pressure, corrected QT interval, the change in corrected QT interval produced by papaverine and the maximal dose of the drug per kilogram of body weight. Of these variables, only baseline heart rate differed significantly in the two groups of patients. Thus, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia is an infrequent, but important, side effect of papaverine that is usually self-limited. Women with a relatively slow heart rate appear to be predisposed to this side effect.\r"

Seventy-five percent of patients had severe triple vessel disease that included severe left main disease in 15%. Total obstruction of one or two arteries was present in 75%. In patients with wall motion abnormalities, 78% of the abnormalities were in the distribution of the aneurysm. Follow-up (range 1 to 90 months [mean 30]) was obtained in all 20 patients. There were two cardiac and two noncardiac deaths; 12 patients had coronary bypass surgery and of 16 survivors, 13 were angina-free. In conclusion, discrete coronary aneurysms are much less common than diffuse ectasia. Unlike ectasia, they are never found in arteries without severe stenosis, and are most common in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Associated coronary artery disease is more severe in patients with discrete aneurysms than in those with diffuse ectasia. Discrete coronary aneurysms do not appear to rupture, and their resection is not warranted.\r"

Myocarditis was strongly suspected clinically in all cases, yet was unconfirmed on initial right ventricular biopsy. Seventeen patients underwent both right and left ventricular biopsy, seven patients had a repeat right ventricular biopsy and four patients underwent repeat left ventricular biopsy alone. The interval between initial and repeat biopsy averaged 31 +/- 6 days. Myocarditis was confirmed on repeat biopsy in 4 of 6 patients whose initial biopsy revealed \"borderline\" myocarditis (that is, interstitial inflammation but absence of myocyte necrosis) compared with none of the 22 patients whose initial biopsy showed either myocyte hypertrophy or interstitial fibrosis, or both (p = 0.0007). \"Borderline\" myocarditis on initial biopsy was the only clinical or histologic finding predictive of myocarditis on subsequent biopsy. Repeat endomyocardial biopsy can identify and potentially modify the treatment of an additional group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and nondiagnostic initial endomyocardial histologic features. Right ventricular sampling should be repeated in patients whose initial biopsy demonstrates \"borderline\" myocarditis.\r"

  ".U": "90131470\r", 
  ".W": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 3 to 10 cases per million. The only type of cardiac involvement ascribed to this neuromuscular disorder is a unique form of heart disease--permanent atrial paralysis. However, reported cases of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy probably represented instead what is now recognized as phenotypically similar Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy. Cardiac involvement, therefore, has not been convincingly reported in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, but because of the clinical similarity of that disorder to Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy and its genetic variants, a prospective investigation of the electrophysiologic properties of the atria and atrioventricular (AV) node and infranodal conduction was undertaken in 30 rigorously documented cases of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. All patients had a 12 lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG), 22 had a 24 h ambulatory ECG, 15 patients had two-dimensional echocardiographic/Doppler studies and 10 patients underwent 12 intracardiac electrophysiologic investigations. Left atrial, right atrial or biatrial P wave abnormalities were present in 60% of the surface ECGs. Evidence of abnormal AV node or infranodal conduction was present on intracardiac electrophysiologic study or surface ECG in 27% of patients. Atrial flutter or fibrillation was induced by single atrial extra stimuli in 10 of the 12 intracardiac electrophysiologic studies. Sinus node function was abnormal in three patients. This investigation provides the first secure evidence of cardiac involvement in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The involvement is represented by relatively high susceptibility to induced atrial flutter or fibrillation during electrophysiologic study, together with less frequent evidence of abnormal sinus node function and abnormal AV node or infranodal conduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90131471\r", 
  ".W": "Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile was investigated as a method to evaluate the results of intravenous thrombolytic treatment in 14 patients (11 men and 3 women) with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 h of the onset of symptoms. All patients received an injection of 740 MBq of the tracer before starting the thrombolytic therapy, and isonitrile tomography was performed 3 to 4 h later. The tomographic study was repeated 5 days after the acute event. The results of thrombolytic treatment were independently evaluated taking into account the clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG) and enzymatic data and the findings of left ventricular and coronary angiography. Furthermore, all patients were studied with two-dimensional echocardiography on admission, 5 days later and 1 month later. The site and extent of the perfusion defects on admission scintigraphy were consonant with the ECG and echocardiographic findings. A good correlation could be established between the 5 day scintigraphic estimate of infarct dimension and the enzymatic infarct size (r = 0.907, p less than 0.00002). The comparison between pre- and postthrombolytic treatment images enabled the identification of successful and unsuccessful reperfusion even in patients whose other noninvasive findings were inconclusive. Finally, the reduction in defect size predicted late functional improvement that was demonstrated by echocardiography performed 1 month later (r = 0.89, p less than 0.00005). The results of the study suggest the feasibility and the possible usefulness of isonitrile tomography in demonstrating the presence and size of myocardial damage and in assessing the extent of myocardial salvage after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of thallium-201 late reversibility was prospectively assessed in 118 patients who had stress-redistribution thallium-201 studies by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These patients demonstrated two or more segments with nonreversible defects at 4 h imaging and underwent late (18 to 72 h) redistribution imaging. When the criterion of late reversibility was defined as greater than or equal to 1 segment with 4 h nonreversible defects demonstrating late reversibility, it was present in 62 (53%) of the 118 patients and 164 (22%) of 762 segments. When the criterion of greater than or equal to 2 segments was used, late reversibility was found in 41 (35%) of 118 patients and 143 (19%) of 762 segments. The frequency of detected reversible defects increased from 27% at 4 h imaging to 43% at combined 4 h and late imaging (p less than 0.0001) and was significantly increased in all myocardial regions. In comparing the efficacy of initial and late imaging alone versus performing initial, 4 h and late imaging for the identification of reversible defects, 421 (94%) of 449 segments classified as reversible by the latter protocol were also correctly identified by the early and late imaging only approach, with the remaining 6% (28 segments) comprising those segments demonstrating the reversible pattern at 4 h and the nonreversible pattern at late imaging. No major differences were noted with respect to clinical, stress electrocardiographic and scintigraphic variables between the 118 patients undergoing late imaging and 98 additional randomly selected patients with two or more nonreversible defects at 4 h, who did not have late imaging.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ultrasound energy at a frequency of 20 kHz was applied with a prototype solid wire probe to 12 surgically implanted occluded human atherosclerotic arterial xenografts, 9 of which were calcified, as well as to the intimal surface of 12 normal canine arteries. In both the normal canine arteries and the atherosclerotic occluded xenografts, there was no angiographic evidence of vasospasm, thrombosis or arterial dissection. Eleven of the 12 atherosclerotic complete arterial occlusions were resistant to passage of a conventional guide wire or probe without ultrasound energy. However, the occlusions were recanalized after administration of 15 s to 4 min (mean 1.5 +/- 1.3 min) of intermittent ultrasound energy. After ultrasound, 8 of the 12 vessels underwent balloon angioplasty. Angiographic residual stenosis after ultrasound alone was 62 +/- 24% and after combined ultrasound and balloon angioplasty, 29 +/- 13%. Although routine angiography did not reveal arterial emboli, high resolution cut films did demonstrate a few distal nonocclusive thrombi of a size similar to that reported with other recanalization methods. Histologic studies demonstrated changes similar to those after balloon angioplasty, with focal cracking of the fibrotic and calcified plaque. The findings demonstrate that ultrasound energy applied through a catheter delivery system can be used in vivo to open completely obstructed atherosclerotic vessels. These studies suggest that it might be clinically feasible to use the ultrasound probe to create a lumen, allowing subsequent balloon dilation.\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of the left ventricular spatial flow pattern for thrombus formation was determined in 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction. A normal flow pattern by pulsed Doppler echocardiography was characterized by 1) simultaneous onset of blood motion at the mitral valve and apical level, and 2) a discontinuous Doppler signal along the lateral wall and interventricular septum. The flow pattern was assessed by these criteria, within 24 h after the onset of complaints and after 6 and 12 weeks. In 46 of the 62 patients, a normal flow pattern was found at the first examination; none of these 46 patients developed a thrombus during the study period. An abnormal flow pattern was seen at the first examination in 16 patients; this pattern normalized during follow-up in 6 patients, none of whom developed a thrombus. In the other 10 patients the abnormal flow pattern persisted, and 7 of these developed a thrombus. These findings suggest that a normal left ventricular flow pattern in the setting of acute myocardial infarction is not associated with subsequent thrombus formation. This observation may be of importance if anticoagulation is considered.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the value of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography during cardiac valve surgery, 154 consecutive patients who had a valve operation in conjunction with pre- and postcardiopulmonary bypass transesophageal imaging were studied. Prebypass imaging yielded unsuspected findings that either assisted or changed the planned operation in 29 (19%) of the 154 patients. Imaging immediately after bypass revealed unsatisfactory operative results that necessitated immediate further surgery in 10 (6%) of the 154 patients. Postbypass left ventricular dysfunction, prompting administration of inotropic agents, was identified in 13 patients (8%). Transesophageal echocardiography proved most useful when both two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging were employed in patients undergoing a mitral valve operation, where surgical decisions based on echocardiographic results were made in 26 (41%) of 64 cases. Postbypass echocardiographic findings identified patients at risk for an adverse postoperative outcome. Of 123 patients whose postbypass valve function was judged to be satisfactory, 18 (15%) had a major postoperative complication and 6 (5%) died, whereas of 7 patients with moderate residual valve dysfunction, 6 (86%) had a postoperative complication and 3 (43%) died (p less than 0.05 for both). Likewise, of 131 patients with preserved postbypass left ventricular function, 12 (9%) had a major complication and 7 (5%) died, whereas of 23 patients with reduced ventricular function, 17 (73%) had a postoperative complication and 6 (26%) died (p less than 0.05 for both). These data indicate that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is useful in formulating the surgical plan, assessing immediate operative results and identifying patients with unsatisfactory results who are at increased risk for postoperative complications.\r"

Patients were classified prospectively as to their eligibility for outpatient cardiac catheterization according to published guidelines. Resource consumption was recorded, and cost savings were then calculated by analyzing the specific supply and personnel costs that could change as a result of inpatient versus outpatient status. Of the total of 986 patients who underwent diagnostic catheterization, 240 (24%) were outpatients, 279 (28%) were inpatients but had no exclusion criteria for outpatient catheterization and 467 (47%) were inpatients who had one or more exclusions for outpatient catheterization. The most common reasons for exclusion from outpatient catheterization were congestive heart failure (22%), unstable angina (15%), noncoronary heart disease (14%), recent myocardial infarction (11%) and severe noncardiac disease (9%). Inpatients with no exclusions for the outpatient procedure tended to be sicker than outpatients because they were older (p = 0.002), had a lower ejection fraction (p = 0.009) and had more triple vessel coronary artery disease (p less than 0.0001). The cost of the catheterization procedure itself was not different between inpatients and outpatients. Laboratory testing was more frequent among inpatients, however, and \"room and board\" costs were significantly higher. Although the difference in hospital charges for inpatients and outpatients was $580, a rigorous analysis indicated that the potential cost savings was only 38% of this amount, or $218 per eligible patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all 19 patients, supraventricular tachycardia was found to have a 1:1 P-QRS relation during initial control electrophysiologic studies, and in all 19 patients, electrophysiologic studies suggested that junctional reentry was the mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia. Seven of the 19 patients developed atrioventricular (AV) block during initiation of supraventricular tachycardia or after induction of supraventricular tachycardia following various drug administrations in subsequent studies. In three patients, second degree block within the His bundle or block distal to the His bundle recording site occurred after administration of quinidine. In one patient it occurred after procainamide, and in another patient it occurred after atropine. In one patient, 2:1 block proximal to the His deflection occurred after verapamil. In the remaining patient, a transient Wenckebach block proximal to the His deflection was noted after adenosine triphosphate. In this latter patient, 2:1 AV block was also noted after propranolol and digoxin. The site of reentry in these seven patients with AV block during supraventricular tachycardia was confined to the AV node area. Their supraventricular tachycardia did not involve a slowly conducting paraseptal accessory pathway because the distal AV node, His bundle and ventricle were not found to be necessary links in the tachycardia circuit.\r"

Abnormal sites were infarcted and demonstrated an electrogram duration greater than 70 ms and amplitude less than 3 mV during sinus rhythm. Bipolar pacing was performed from poles 1 (cathode) and 3 (1 cm interelectrode distance) of a quadripolar catheter. Unipolar cathodal pacing was performed from the tip electrode (pole 1). Local activation was indexed by the interval from the pacing stimulus to 1) the onset of the QRS complex, 2) the largest rapid deflection of the local electrogram, and 3) the end (total duration) of the local electrogram recorded from poles 2 and 4 of the quadripolar catheter used for left ventricular pacing. Distant activation was indexed by the interval from pacing stimulus to electrograms recorded at the right ventricular apex and outflow tract. Bipolar and unipolar pacing of normal sites produced a modest homogeneous reduction of all activation times by 3 to 11 ms (median) with increments in current strength from threshold (0.8 mA) to 20 mA. Bipolar pacing of abnormal sites showed marked (up to 110 ms) and heterogeneous changes in local (median 22 to 30 ms) as well as distant (median 14 to 23 ms) activation times with increases in current strength from threshold (2.7 mA) to 20 mA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Informal observations suggested that the effective refractory period lengthened with a prolongation of the time in sinus rhythm (basic cycle length time) between successive runs of drive stimuli (S1S1s). If this were true, failure to control the basic cycle length time could affect the results and interpretation of electrophysiologic testing. To study this phenomenon, the effective refractory period was studied in 20 patients during sinus rhythm and two ventricular paced rates with up to three extrastimuli, while varying the basic cycle length time from 2 to 3, to 10 to 20 s. With each of the stimulation sequences used, the effective refractory period lengthened as the basic cycle length time increased (\"basic cycle length time-effective refractory period effect\"). The effect was most pronounced when extrastimuli were used during the two ventricular paced rates. As the basic cycle length time increased from 2 to 3 to 20 s, the mean effective refractory period determined during sinus rhythm increased from 296 to 300 ms; with the first ventricular paced rate, the effective refractory period increased from 259 to 272 ms (p less than 0.0003) and with the second ventricular paced rate, the effective refractory period increased from 250 to 263 ms (p less than 0.01). The basic cycle length time-effective refractory period effect became more pronounced as the number of extrastimuli increased. With the second ventricular paced rate, as basic cycle length was increased from 2 to 3 to 20 s, the mean prolongation in the cumulative effective refractory period (S1 to final extrastimulus) as the number of extrastimuli increased from 1 to 2 to 3, was 13 (p less than 0.01), 42 (p less than 0.0003) and 82 ms (p less than 0.001), respectively. Results were confirmed in 17 instances by redetermining the effective refractory period at the 2 to 3 s basic cycle length time after the final 20 s basic cycle length time determination, and demonstrating that it was similar to the effective refractory period after the initial 2 to 3 s basic cycle length time. No further prolongation of the effective refractory period could be demonstrated by increasing basic cycle length time from 20 to 60 s, and no significant effect of medications on the basic cycle length time-effective refractory period effect could be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Atherectomy is a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, and permits the controlled excision and retrieval of portions of stenosing lesions. The gross and light microscopic features of 218 peripheral arterial stenoses resected from 100 patients by atherectomy were studied. One hundred seventy of these lesions were primary stenoses and 48 were restenoses subsequent to prior angioplasty or atherectomy. Microscopically, primary stenoses were composed of atherosclerotic plaque (150 lesions), fibrous intimal thickening (15 lesions) or thrombus alone (5 lesions). Atherosclerotic plaques had a variable morphology and, in one-third of cases, were accompanied by abundant surface thrombus that probably added to the severity of stenosis. Most patients with fibrous intimal thickening or thrombus alone had typical atherosclerotic plaque removed elsewhere from within the same artery. Intimal hyperplasia, with or without underlying residual plaque, was found at 36 sites of restenosis, the remaining 12 consisting of plaque only. Intimal hyperplasia had a distinctive histologic appearance and was due to smooth muscle cell proliferation within a loosely fibrous stroma. Superimposed thrombus may have contributed to arterial narrowing in 25% of hyperplastic and 8% of atherosclerotic restenoses (p = 0.41). Pathologic examination of tissues recovered by peripheral atherectomy is an important adjunct that may provide insight into the efficacy of vascular interventions and the phenomenon of postintervention restenosis.\r"

This retrospective study related preoperative clinical and hemodynamic data to subsequent survival. Twenty patients less than 4 years old had tricuspid atresia, 13 had double inlet ventricle and 21 had other complex heart defects. There were 14 early deaths (less than 30 days after operation) and 6 late deaths. Multivariate analysis of survival for the entire group of 500 patients revealed the following factors to be significantly associated with poorer survival: absence of tricuspid atresia (p = 0.011), asplenia (p less than 0.001), age less than 4 years at operation (p = 0.042), atrioventricular valve dysfunction (p = 0.017), early calendar year of operation (p less than 0.001) and the presence of either one or more of the following: left ventricular ejection fraction less than 60%, mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 15 mm Hg and pulmonary arteriolar resistance greater than 4 U.m2 (p less than 0.001). On the basis of this study of 500 patients, age less than 4 years at operation appears to be an independent risk factor for poorer survival after the modified Fontan operation.\r"

Maximal tricuspid regurgitant Doppler velocity in 21 of these patients was used to validate the pulmonary artery pressures derived from ductal flow velocities. There was a significant linear correlation between tricuspid regurgitant Doppler velocity and pulmonary artery systolic pressure derived from ductal Doppler velocities in patients with unidirectional (pure left to right or pure right to left) ductal shunting (p less than 0.001, r = 0.95, SEE 8) and in those with bidirectional shunting (p less than 0.001, r = 0.95, SEE 4.5). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure in group 1 (67 +/- 13 mm Hg) was significantly higher than that in group 2 (39 +/- 10 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). In those with bidirectional shunting, duration of right to left shunting less than 60% of systole was found when pulmonary artery pressure was systemic or less, whereas duration greater than or equal to 60% was associated with suprasystemic pulmonary artery pressures. Serial changes in pulmonary artery systolic pressure, reflected by changes in ductal Doppler velocities, correlated with clinical status in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Persistently suprasystemic pulmonary artery pressure was associated with death in five group 1 patients. It is concluded that ductal Doppler velocities can be reliably utilized to monitor the course of pulmonary artery systolic pressures in newborns.\r"

  ".U": "90131495\r", 
  ".W": "PART I: Coronary flow reserve indicates functional stenosis severity, but may be altered by physiologic conditions unrelated to stenosis geometry. To assess the effects of changing physiologic conditions on coronary flow reserve, aortic pressure and heart rate-blood pressure (rate-pressure) product were altered by phenylephrine and nitroprusside in 11 dogs. There was a total of 366 measurements, 26 without and 340 with acute stenoses of the left circumflex artery by a calibrated stenoser, providing percent area stenosis with flow reserve measured by flow meter after the administration of intracoronary adenosine. Absolute coronary flow reserve (maximal flow/rest flow) with no stenosis was 5.9 +/- 1.5 (1 SD) at control study, 7.0 +/- 2.2 after phenylephrine and 4.6 +/- 2.0 after nitroprusside, ranging from 2.0 to 12.1 depending on aortic pressure and rate-pressure product. However, relative coronary flow reserve (maximal flow with stenosis/normal maximal flow without stenosis) was independent of aortic pressure and rate-pressure product. Over the range of aortic pressures and rate-pressure products, the size of 1 SD expressed as a percent of mean absolute coronary flow reserve was +/- 43% without stenosis, and for each category of stenosis severity from 0 to 100% narrowing, it averaged +/- 45% compared with +/- 17% for relative coronary flow reserve. For example, for a 65% stenosis, absolute flow reserve was 5.2 +/- 1.7 (+/- 33% variation), whereas relative flow reserve was 0.9 +/- 0.09 (+/- 10% variation), where 1.0 is normal. Therefore, absolute coronary flow reserve by flow meter was highly variable for fixed stenoses depending on aortic pressure and rate-pressure product, whereas relative flow reserve more accurately and specifically described stenosis severity independent of physiologic conditions. Together, absolute and relative coronary flow reserve provide a more complete description of physiologic stenosis severity than either does alone. PART II: Coronary flow reserve directly measured by a flow meter is altered not only by stenosis, but also by physiologic variables. Stenosis flow reserve is derived from length, percent stenosis, absolute diameters and shape by quantitative coronary arteriography using standardized physiologic conditions. To study the relative merits of absolute coronary flow reserve measured by flow meter and stenosis flow reserve determined by quantitative coronary arteriography for assessing stenosis severity, aortic pressure and rate-pressure product were altered by phenylephrine and nitroprusside in 11 dogs, with 366 stenoses of the left circumflex artery by a calibrated stenoser providing percent area stenosis as described in Part I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A perforated catheter was used to deliver either horseradish peroxidase or fluoresceinated heparin under pressure to the canine arterial wall. Depth of penetration of the media by horseradish peroxidase was dependent on perfusion pressure. At 5 bar pressure for 1 min, the entire media showed a reaction product for horseradish peroxidase. Fluoresceinated heparin delivered under the same conditions could be demonstrated to traverse the entire media as well. A pressure of 5 bars caused medial necrosis at 48 h after perfusion, even when the perfusing solution was saline. (This did not differ from the effect of standard angioplasty at the same pressure.) However, heparin at 5,000 U/ml did not cause medial alteration at 48 h when delivered at the lower pressure of 500 mm Hg. It is feasible to deliver heparin over 1 min in high concentration to the arterial wall by means of this balloon catheter. This method may permit the use of commercially prepared heparin in high concentration as an antiproliferative agent to control the problem of restenosis after angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "With the high initial success rates for coronary angioplasty that are reported regularly, it has become increasingly difficult to demonstrate methods or techniques that are able to provide more beneficial early results than can be achieved by conventional angioplasty. On the other hand, the incidence of late restenosis has remained much the same over the 10 years that angioplasty has been part of clinical practice, and there is still no proved intervention that modifies the restenosis process. Therefore, the problem of restenosis has assumed increasing relevance in determining the clinical value of coronary angioplasty and, accordingly, studies that address the problem of restenosis need to become more exacting. Although numerous articles have addressed the problem of restenosis in the clinical setting, many defining certain factors associated with restenosis and possible interventions to reduce the incidence of restenosis, there is surprisingly little consensus. Most of the discrepancies can be attributed to three factors: 1) the selection of patients, 2) the method of analysis, and 3) the definition of restenosis employed. This review shows how these three factors influence the outcome and conclusions of restenosis studies.\r"

  ".U": "90131499\r", 
  ".W": "Infection of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa occurs most commonly in association with infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. Infection of the aortic valve results in a regurgitant jet that presumably strikes this subaortic interannular zone of fibrous tissue and produces a secondary site of infection. Infection of this interannular zone then leads to the formation of subaortic abscess or pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricular outflow tract. This infected zone of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa or subaortic aneurysm can subsequently rupture into the left atrium with systolic ejection of blood from the left ventricular outflow tract to the left atrium. This report describes the echocardiographic findings in three patients with pathologically proved left ventricular outflow tract to left atrial communication. Precise preoperative diagnosis is important, and this lesion should be differentiated from ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva and perforation of the anterior mitral leaflet. Transthoracic echocardiography using color flow imaging and conventional Doppler techniques may show an eccentric mitral regurgitation type of signal in the left atrium originating from the region of the left ventricular outflow tract. However, transesophageal echocardiography provides an accurate preoperative diagnosis and should be used intraoperatively during repair of such lesions.\r"

A prick test with undiluted seminal fluid produced a 5.0 mm wheal-and-flare response with pseudopods. Prick tests with saliva and serum from the same source as the seminal fluid were negative. Measurement of IgE antibody to seminal-fluid allergen with a Biotin-Avidin ELISA technique yielded strong activity. No IgG antibody could be detected. Significant prick test reactivity could be found in Sephadex G-100 fractions that had a molecular weight range of 12,000 to 75,000 daltons and that contained approximately 5% of the total protein in the starting material. Isoelectric focusing fractions with strong skin test reactivity had a pI range of 5.4 to 6.6. These fractions contained one major protein band. Immunotherapy was conducted with a Sephadex fraction of seminal fluid during a 24-month period. A cumulative dose of 32 mg of protein was administered. No side effects other than local swelling occurred. Ten months after the start of immunotherapy, IgE antibody became unmeasureable, an effect that was demonstrated not due to the inhibitory effect of IgG antibody. IgG antibody rose progressively in this period. Clinically, the patient became less sensitive to topical contact. Although the natural history of seminal-fluid allergy is not known, immunotherapy may be effective.\r"

The mothers of 65 infants avoided eggs, CM, and fish during the first 3 months of lactation (maternal antigen avoidance diet, D group), whereas the remaining 50 mothers had no diet restrictions (no maternal antigen avoidance diet, ND group). CM was introduced after 6 months of age and EW after 9 months. The only statistically significant difference between the D and ND group infants was a lower rate of specimens with IgE antibodies to EW and/or CM in the infants at 3 months of age (p = 0.008). IgE antibodies to EW and/or CM appeared in 62 infants during the study period and often during complete breast-feeding. In 40 of the infants, IgE antibodies appeared before the introduction of EW and CM into the diet. The IgE concentrations of the D and the ND group infants were similar. Cord-blood IgE was a poor predictor of atopy/allergy; for example, only seven of 103 infants with double heredity for atopy/allergy had values above the 90th percentile of our normal reference. The concentrations of IgG antibodies to OA and BLG were similar in the two groups. The levels decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) from birth to 6 months of age, indicating a passive placental transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, 101 subjects (85%) were reinvestigated after a mean period of 16 years; 43% had current symptoms. Skin test reactivity to all allergens and the number of subjects with positive skin tests to more than one allergen increased from childhood to adulthood. Subjects with allergic rhinitis (38%) had a higher number of positive skin tests to grass pollen in both childhood and adulthood than subjects without allergic rhinitis. Fifty-three children and 10 adults had atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis occurred with equal frequency in children who did and in children who did not have current symptoms later in life. No differences in skin test reactivity to allergens were found between smoking and nonsmoking subjects. Although the smoking period was relatively short, smoking was correlated with eosinophilia in adulthood. The mean number of eosinophils decreased significantly between the first and second survey. The outcome of childhood asthma as defined by current symptoms was not predicted by skin reactivity to allergens, eosinophilia, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis in childhood.\r"

Treatment with nedocromil sodium significantly (p less than 0.02) inhibited the accumulation of mast cells but not eosinophils. Compared with the placebo-treated group, the group treated with nedocromil demonstrated a significant (p less than 0.025) reduction in the requirements for treatment with concomitant medication (terfenadine tablets and xylometazoline/antazoline eye drops). These results indicate that natural exposure to allergen in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis is accompanied by infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils into the nasal mucous membrane. The clinical efficacy of nedocromil sodium in this condition may be related to inhibition of infiltration by mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation challenge with the culture filtrate-antigens prepared from two strains of different serotype of Trichosporon cutaneum (TIMM 1573, serotype I; TIMM 1318, serotype II) was performed on patients with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asymptomatic seropositive family members. Of the 17 patients, 12 were strongly positive, four were mildly so, and one was negative. Interestingly, of the 16 inhalation challenge-positive patients, four reacted to both serotypes I and II, five to serotype I only, and seven to serotype II only. There was a good correlation between the serotype inhalation challenge-positive antigen and that of T. cutaneum isolated from the homes of two patients' homes. A strain of T. cutaneum demonstrating a new serotype was isolated from the homes of two patients, one of whom was negative to both serotypes I and II. Specific antibody activity, lymphocyte proliferative response, and skin reaction to the antigens were also positive, but these findings were not useful to discriminate the inhalation challenge-positive from the inhalation challenge-negative antigen. Neither of the two asymptomatic family members responded. These results indicate that inhalation challenge in patients with summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis is provoked by the serotype-related antigen of T. cutaneum, reflecting the sensitization of these patients in their homes.\r"

Thirty-five patients were desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA treatment (Rx) for as long as 8 years (mean, 3.75 years) to May 1988 and were designated the continuous group. Thirty patients, initially desensitized to ASA and treated with daily ASA, who stopped Rx permanently after a mean duration of 2 years, were designated the discontinued group. Retrospective analyses of baselines revealed that both continuous and discontinued groups during ASA Rx demonstrated statistically significant reduction in number of hospitalizations per year, emergency room visits per year, outpatient visits per year, upper respiratory infections-sinusitis-antibiotics per year, need for nasal polypectomies and additional sinus operations, and improvement in sense of smell compared to the control group. Simultaneously, the ASA-Rx groups were able to significantly reduce systemic corticosteroid dosage, corticosteroid bursts per year, and, in the continuous group only, significantly reduce inhaled corticosteroids. All three groups maintained control of respiratory symptoms. ASA desensitization followed by long-term daily ASA Rx appears to improve ASA-sensitive rhinosinusitis-asthma and concomitantly allows reduction of systemic corticosteroids.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 380 schoolchildren living in Belmont, New South Wales, a coastal town where the predominant aeroallergens are house dust mites, were studied on three occasions at 2-year intervals. At each study, atopy was measured by skin prick tests to 13 allergens, bronchial responsiveness was measured by histamine inhalation test, and respiratory illness history was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire to parents. The age of the group was 8 to 10 years at enrollment. We found that skin wheals less than 4 mm were not associated with respiratory or allergic illness, and therefore, we defined atopy as the presence of a skin wheal of greater than or equal to 4 mm. In the sample, 24% of the children were atopic at 8 to 10 years (early-onset atopy), and an additional 15% became atopic during the study (late-onset atopy). Both early- and late-onset atopy had a close association with hay fever. Late-onset atopy was strongly associated with inconsistent reporting of symptoms. Early-onset atopy was an important risk factor for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), diagnosed asthma, and continuing symptoms of wheeze, and was a particularly important risk factor for BHR with current wheeze in late childhood years. We conclude that atopy acquired at an early age is an important predictive factor for respiratory symptoms occurring with BHR and continuing into late childhood.\r"

Using an electrical stimulation device, we collected Africanized HB venom (AHV) in Venezuela and European HB venom (EHV) in Louisiana. These venoms, along with commercial European HB venom (CHV), were compared by thin-layer isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Coomassie brilliant blue and silver-stained banding patterns of AHV and EHV were essentially identical to CHV. Western blots were prepared from SDS-PAGE gels and tested with pooled sera from EHV-sensitive subjects and then radiolabeled antihuman IgE. The resulting autoradiographs revealed similar banding patterns among EHV, AHV, and CHV. RAST-inhibition studies were performed with solid-phase CHV and pooled sera from EHV-sensitive subjects. The specific allergenic activities of the three HB venoms (allergy units per milligram of protein) were comparable. By RAST-inhibition assay with solid-phase, highly purified individual venom components, AHV and EHV both contained phospholipase A2, hyaluronidase, and high-molecular-weight allergens. The increased morbidity after Africanized HB stings is likely related to their more defensive behavior during which many bees react by stinging rather than to biochemical or allergenic differences between AHV and EHV.\r"

The patient was classified as a patient with corticosteroid-dependent IA, a subset of patients with IA in whom a remission cannot be induced with prednisone and in whom prednisone cannot be stopped. A trial of ketotifen is in progress without definitive effect on prednisone requirement. Because this corticosteroid-dependent patient with IA, which is potentially fatal, cannot be managed on less than 90 mg of alternate-day prednisone, we propose the term malignant IA to categorize such severe cases of IA.\r"

With a RAST-inhibition assay that used specific cat IgE antibodies from cat-sensitive subjects, we ranked the allergen production of each cat. From these nine cats, three high producers and one low producer were studied further. Each cat's allergens were collected for two to four separate 1-hour intervals on 6 different days. The high producers' samples remained high in allergen content, and the low producer's sample remained low. An additional eight cats were selected for similar longitudinal measurements, and allergens from each of these 12 cats were collected during four 1-hour intervals on 2 different days and assayed for total allergy units (AUs) by RAST inhibition and for the major cat allergen, Fel d I, by a two-site assay with a monoclonal antibody. Shedding, particularly by high producers, varied considerably from hour to hour. We found a hundredfold difference in AUs between the mean rate of shedding of the highest and lowest producers and a sixfold difference in Fel d I units. Variation in rate of shedding of Fel d I accounted for about half the variation of shedding of AUs. Allergen shedding varies not only between cats but also in the same cat during the course of a day and between days. Male cats shed more than female cats.\r"

  ".W": "Very elderly individuals with multiple chronic illnesses are at high risk of orthostatic hypotension, falls, and associated morbidity and mortality. Alterations in cardiac volumes and filling characteristics may contribute in part to an increased prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and falls in these people. In this study cardiac function was evaluated with gated radionuclide ventriculography in eight healthy young subjects (19-38 years) and 25 elderly persons with stable chronic illnesses (73-96 years), 14 of whom had a history of recurrent falls. Blood pressure was measured supine during the radionuclide ventriculography, then after one minute of standing. Supine stroke volume index, end diastolic volume index, cardiac index, and peak filling rates were significantly lower in elderly subjects compared to young, and ejection fraction and end systolic volume index (measures of systolic function) were the same in young and old. Compared to the young, elderly subjects had a reduction in ventricular filling during the first third of diastole, but an augmentation in the last third, during atrial contraction. Within the group of elderly subjects, the directional change in systolic blood pressure during orthostasis was significantly correlated with basal supine systolic blood pressure (R = 0.81, P less than .0001) and supine cardiac index (R = 0.66, P = .002). Thus, very old people representative of those seen in clinical practice have reduced cardiac volumes and impaired early diastolic filling, a result possibly related to elevations in systolic blood pressure. These changes in cardiac structure and function may contribute, in part, to orthostatic hypotension in advanced age.\r"

  ".U": "90131532\r", 
  ".W": "Although Special Care Units (SCUs) have recently gained attention as appropriate places for caring for institutionalized patients with dementia, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness. This pilot study focused primarily on one aspect of patient care, the possible prevention of acute hospitalization. Because transfer from nursing home to the acute hospital can be a traumatic experience for patients with dementia, important services that SCUs might provide include those preventive strategies aimed at reducing the need for transfer to the acute hospital. Medical record abstraction revealed that over one year, the rate of acute hospitalization was 21% among 47 patients with dementia in SCUs, compared with 14% among 36 patients with dementia and 14% among 22 patients with no listed diagnosis of dementia residing in non-SCU settings within the same facility. Thus, no statistically significant difference in hospitalization rates was found, although the trend was for increased hospitalization for SCU patients. There was a trend toward deterioration in functional status among SCU patients following first hospitalization (P less than .10). Since the majority of these patients were hospitalized for hip fractures, this finding was not unexpected. There was a trend toward cognitive decline after hospitalization among patients with dementia who were not residing in an SCU (P less than .10). In order to investigate whether acute hospitalizations among SCU patients were preventable, an expert panel was convened to review each episode of illness leading to acute hospitalization. Of the 15 hospitalizations, none were judged \"preventable,\" four were believed to be \"possibly preventable,\" and 11 were considered to have been \"not preventable.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Retirees who elected to become physically inactive exhibited significant declines in cerebral blood flow (CBF) throughout four years of follow-up. Those who continued to work or retirees who elected to participate in regular activities sustained more constant CBF levels. Active retirees and those who continued to work also scored better on cognitive testing after the fourth year of follow-up compared to inactive retirees.\r"

Although definitions in the field of dementia initially seem reasonably straightforward, specific problem areas exist. This multidisciplinary field encompasses a variety of physician specialists, as well as other diverse professionals and brings not only the benefit of a rich mix of backgrounds, but also provides a medium for potential misunderstanding due to miscommunication. The variety of definitions of dementia, and especially the label, \"reversible dementia,\" exemplifies this problem. Disease-specific dementias, pseudodementia, and delirium are three clinical situations that may or may not be classified as \"reversible dementias,\" depending on individual training, custom, and jargon. Use of the term \"reversible dementia\" may cause misunderstanding and inefficiency and benefits neither patient nor caregiver. It is suggested that the term be replaced. Further, all diagnostic labels should be clearly understood and explained. Emphasis must be placed on promoting the fact that all patients with cognitive/functional decline, no matter how defined or what the cause, are eminently treatable individuals.\r"

  ".U": "90131537\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred ninety-eight nursing home admissions underwent audiometric assessment and answered questions regarding hearing difficulty in common listening situations. Twenty-four percent demonstrated normal thresholds (0-25 dB) in the speech frequencies with only mild losses at 4000 Hz. Fifty-four percent had normal thresholds through the speech frequencies with moderate to profound losses at higher frequencies, or mild losses (26-40 dB) in the speech frequencies. Such persons would be at risk in daily listening situations. Twenty-two percent had moderate or greater losses (greater than 40 dB) through the entire frequency range. Sixteen percent of this significantly impaired group were not identified as having a hearing loss by either the admitting RN or physician. Sixty percent of residents reported trouble in a group if they could not see the speaker's face, when watching television, and/or when using the telephone. The data indicate that a systematic hearing screening program is the most reliable means of identifying hearing loss and functional hearing handicap on an individual basis. The high prevalence of hearing problems suggests that this handicap also needs to be addressed from the perspective of institutional policy. Staff training and environmental modification should be undertaken to give hearing support to the entire nursing home population.\r"

The autopsy rate was 3.5%. Major discrepancies appeared in 47.1% of cases. Pneumonia was the most frequent and most frequently missed diagnosis. Only 23 of 34 death certificates reflected the cause of death as documented in the chart, and only 12 had concordant diagnoses with those from autopsy. After a collective educational effort, the autopsy rate increased from a rate (average of initial six years) of 2.4% to 10.8% in the last year. The autopsy rate is low, but can be improved with educational efforts. Death certificates, in this population, may be misleading when used for general statistical purposes.\r"

Samples of foot callus obtained from a local chiropodist were extracted at room temperature with chloroform: methanol mixtures (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2). The extracts were concentrated, filtered to remove nonlipid debris, and dissolved in chloroform: methanol, 2:1, at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. Small portions of extract were treated with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene to convert free amino groups to N-dinitrophenyl derivatives, which were subsequently separated from other components by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitated by photodensitometry at a wave-length of 355 nm. The N-dinitrophenylsphingosines were then isolated by preparative TLC and oxidized with lead tetraacetate in benzene to produce aldehydes, which were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. It was found that callus lipid contained 3.39 +/- 0.57 mg free sphingosine, 1.60 +/- 0.72 mg dihydrosphingosine and traces of phytosphingosine per g lipid. The sphingosines and dihydrosphingosines ranged from 16 through 20 carbons in length, with 18:1 as the predominant constituent. These findings are similar to those recently reported for pig epidermis and support the possible role of free sphingosine as a regulator of epidermal differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Based on melanoma pathogenesis, phenotypic dynamics in pigment cell tumor progression detected with 11 MoAb have been defined. Anti-melanosomal A4F11 antibody reacts with every type of pigment cell tumor tested except for a few specimens. TNKH1 and anti-K.1.2 antibodies recognize nevocytic benign to premalignant tumors. HLA-DR, A.1.43, and A.10.33 antigens are expressed in advanced melanomas. Staining with anti-ganglioside GM3 and GD3 antibodies, M2590 and 4.2, respectively, reveals that most pigment cell tumors express gangliosides GM3 and GD3. But A2B5 antibody, which detects some polysialogangliosides such as GQ1C, reacts with highly progressed melanoma cells. Anti-ras p21 antibodies, RASK-3 and RASK-4, react with malignant melanomas and their premalignant lesions. These findings suggest the following: A4F11 is a universal marker of pigment cell tumors. TNKH1 and anti-K.1.2 antibodies might not be markers of melanocytic tumors but of nevocytic benign to premalignant tumors. Melanoma cells express gangliosides GM3 and GD3 as common pigment cell antigens and synthesize aberrant polysialogangliosides. Anti-ganglioside MoAb, including A2B5, are possible markers of the level of malignancy in melanoma cells like anti-A.1.43 and anti-A.10.33 antibodies. Enhanced ras p21 expression already appears on premalignant pigment cells.\r"

We have analyzed the relationship between keratinocyte differentiation and Ad2 early and late gene expression. Cultured epidermal keratinocytes infected with Ad2 were fractionated in density gradients of Ficoll 400 to enrich for populations of nondifferentiated cells and differentiated cells. Analysis of these populations revealed that both populations supported early Ad2 gene expression but restricted Ad2 late gene expression. The restriction to late gene expression differed in the two cell populations: Nondifferentiated keratinocytes did not support production of high levels of Ad2 capsid proteins, whereas differentiated keratinocytes supported synthesis of Ad2 capsid proteins but restricted Ad2 expression at a later step that normally leads to production of high titers of progeny virus. The changing restriction to Ad2 expression during keratinocyte differentiation may have resulted from changes in cellular components that play a role in cell differentiation.\r"

In a preliminary report, we described increased collagen synthesis in fibroblasts derived from two WS patients. The present study was undertaken to determine the degree of the regulation of collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts from two other patients. Overproduction of collagenase sensitive protein was observed in WS fibroblasts. Collagen m-RNA levels, that were determined by hybridization of RNA blots with specific cDNA were about 2 times greater than those in the control cells. These results suggest that control of collagen synthesis in WS fibroblasts is altered at the transcriptional level.\r"

  ".U": "90131838\r", 
  ".W": "Analysis of nucleotide sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the human elastin gene has revealed several unusual features, suggesting that regulation of elastin gene expression is complex. To identify any cis-acting regulatory promoter elements, a 35-kb fragment of DNA (CosE) was isolated from a human genomic cosmid library by hybridizations with a human elastin cDNA. Southern blots of EcoRI digests of CosE DNA, utilizing a 5'-end labeled 21-mer oligonucleotide corresponding to the signal sequence of elastin, revealed the presence of a single 7.8-kb genomic fragment. Partial dideoxynucleotide sequencing of this EcoRI genomic subclone revealed that it extended approximately 2.5 kb 3' of the translation initiation site (ATG), encompassing exon 1 and a portion of the first intron, while the remaining DNA encompassed the 5'-flanking region. Exonuclease III digestion (3'----5') was performed to remove sequences of the first intron and first exon, including the ATG site. One clone, approximately 5 kb in size, had the 3' end located 14 bp upstream of the ATG site. A 462-bp 3' portion of this 5-kb fragment was subcloned into a Bluescript/CAT chimeric plasmid (pBS0CAT) to generate an elastin gene promoter/CAT reporter gene construct (pEP6CAT). Transient transfection experiments with pEP6CAT using human skin fibroblasts, human HT-1080, mouse NIH-3T3, or freshly isolated neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells revealed significant CAT activity in each cell line. These results suggest that the 5'-flanking region of the elastin gene contains the cis-acting regulatory elements necessary for transcription. The chimeric plasmid pEP6CAT provides a means to study the transcriptional control of elastin gene expression by exogenous affector molecules, as well as in human dermatologic diseases.\r"

  ".U": "90131839\r", 
  ".W": "Progressive systemic sclerosis is characterized by extensive generalized fibrotic destruction associated with increased accumulation of collagen and other extracellular macromolecules in the skin and other involved organs. It has been suggested that mediators released from mononuclear or endothelial cells play a critical role in the initial activation of connective tissue metabolism. Transforming growth factors beta(TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2) mediate the inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation and the induction of fibronectin and collagen gene expression. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of both TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 mRNA and the final proteins in PSS skin in comparison with other inflammatory dermatoses and healthy controls by means of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Our studies revealed TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2 mRNA in dermal and subcutaneous infiltrating cells in both acute and chronic PSS, but also in the other inflammatory skin disorders. In the vicinity of this infiltrate single TGF-beta positive fibroblasts could be found in acute PSS. The cytoplasm of epithelial cells of all skin adnexa showed TGF-beta transcripts and no apparent differences were seen in the distribution and number of autoradiographic grains between diseased and healthy skin samples. Especially, we could demonstrate abundant expression of TGF-beta 1/2 in epithelial hair follicle cells of the outer root sheath. Generally, the expression of TGF-beta 2 was less abundant than TGF-beta 1. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the same distribution pattern of the final proteins. Our data indicate that TGF-beta expression in infiltrating cells is not a specific feature of fibrotic disease, but seems to be associated with highly proliferating cells in general, perhaps functioning as common mediator in regulation of cellular physiology with special importance for negative control of cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "Purified T lymphocytes fail to proliferate in response to antigenic and mitogenic stimuli when cultured in the presence of accessory cells that have been exposed in vitro to sublethal doses of UVB radiation. Because proliferation represents a final stage in the T-cell activation process, the present study was conducted to determine whether T cells were able to progress through any of the pre-mitotic stages when UVB-irradiated monocytes were used as model accessory cells. In these experiments, monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies were employed as the mitogenic stimulus. Culture of T cells with UVB-irradiated monocytes did allow the T cells to undergo an increase in intracellular free calcium, which is one of the first steps in the activation sequence. The T cells expressed interleukin-2 receptors, although at a reduced level. However, T cells failed to produce interleukin-2 above background levels when they were placed in culture with monocytes exposed to UVB doses as low as 50 J/m2. Incubation of T cells with UVB-irradiated monocytes did not affect the subsequent capacity of T cells to proliferate, since they developed a normal proliferative response in secondary culture when restimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies and unirradiated monocytes. These studies indicate that T lymphocytes become partially activated when cultured with UVB-irradiated monocytes and mitogenic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, they suggest that interleukin-2 production is the T-cell activation step most sensitive to inhibition when UVB-irradiated monocytes are employed as accessory cells.\r"

Epidermis from split-thickness porcine skin is enzymatically separated from dermis with 0.25% Dispase solution (37 degrees C) within 3 h, and trypsinized to a single cell suspension. Keratinocytes are grown in Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 100 micrograms/ml penicillin, 100 micrograms/ml streptomycin, and 20% (cells from six-month-old pigs) or 10% fetal calf serum (cells from two-month-old pigs). Freshly isolated keratinocytes are plated at a density of 1.25 X 10(6) cells/ml since their plating efficiency is about 15 times lower than that of human keratinocytes grown under comparable conditions. Primary keratinocytes plated on plastic grow to confluence faster than those plated on lethally irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder layer cells. Porcine keratinocytes grown on plastic reach senescence in the third passage but, when subsequently cultivated on a lethally irradiated 3T3-J2 feeder layer, can be passaged up to seven times. Nevertheless, plating efficiency of second-passage porcine keratinocytes is only about 5%-7%, whereas that of human newborn foreskin keratinocytes is 20%-30%. Confluent stratified primary cultures grown on plastic, or secondary cultures grown on feeder layers, are used for grafting. The sheets are detached with Dispase solution and stapled to vaseline gauze to facilitate handling. Epidermal regeneration from porcine grafts produced by this method has been demonstrated after transplantation to full-thickness wounds excised to muscle fascia in donor animals.\r"

We have investigated the suitability of two species of snake (Elaphe obsoleta, Python molurus) for this purpose and compared our in vitro experimental results for human skin and for hairless mouse, a currently popular model. The effects of long-term hydration on the membranes were investigated over 8 d using tritiated water as a model permeant. The initial permeability coefficients of all the membranes were similar (0.74-2.2 X 10(-3) cm 2h-1). Although the human and squamate skins did not change significantly over the test period, the permeability of hairless mouse skin increased 37 times. The actions of typical enhancers on the permeabilities of the membranes to a model penetrant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were tested using 3% Azone in Tween 20/saline, propylene glycol (PG), 2% Azone in PG, and 5% oleic acid in PG. While the data from snake membranes tended to underestimate the enhancer effects, those from hairless mouse skin greatly overestimated the changes. None of the membranes was a completely reliable model for assessing human percutaneous absorption as modified by accelerants. Pretreatment with acetone did not significantly change the permeability of human or squamate skins to 5-FU, although that of hairless mouse increased twentyfold. An overall conclusion is that, wherever possible, human skin should be used in absorption studies and not hairless mouse or snake skin; otherwise, misleading results may be obtained.\r"

Evidence of covalent binding to DNA by components of these mixtures was sought in a) human skin biopsy samples from 12 psoriasis patients receiving therapy with these agents, b) human skin explants maintained in organ culture and treated topically with the tars, and c) the skin and lungs of mice treated with repeated doses of the formulations following the regimen used in the clinic. DNA was isolated from the human and mouse tissues and digested enzymically to mononucleotides. 32P-Post-labeling analysis revealed the presence of aromatic DNA adducts in the biopsy samples at levels of up to 0.4 fmol total adducts/microgram DNA. Treatment of human skin in organ culture produced similar levels of adducts, while treatment with dithranol, a non-mutagenic therapeutic agent, resulted in chromatograms indistinguishable from those from untreated controls. In mouse skin, coal-tar ointment and juniper tar gave similar DNA adduct levels, with a similar time-course of removal: maximum levels (0.5 fmol/microgram DNA) at 24 h after the final treatment declined rapidly to 0.05 fmol/microgram at 7 d, thereafter declining slowly over the succeeding 25 d. However, while coal-tar ointment produced only very low levels of adducts in mouse lung (less than 0.03 fmol/microgram DNA), juniper tar produced adducts at a high level (0.7 fmol/microgram DNA) that were persistent in this tissue. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of potentially carcinogenic DNA damage in human and mouse tissue by components of these therapeutic tar preparations.\r"

The densities of both Langerhans cells (LC) and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells were found to decrease with age. Epidermal cell suspensions from aged mice showed impaired immunologic function as assessed in vitro by the skin-lymphocyte reaction assay and by measuring the ability of epidermal cell suspensions to stimulate the proliferation of sensitized T cells in the presence of the sensitizing antigen. However, the capacity of LC to transport antigen from the skin to the draining lymph nodes was found in vivo to be comparable to that of young mice. Results of transplantation of bone marrow cells from young and old donors into irradiated recipients indicate that the decreased Langerhans cell density found in old mice may result from a deficiency in Langerhans cell bone marrow progenitors.\r"

No banded anchoring fibrils were observed along either the roof or the floor of the blister; however, small filamentous structures, possibly immature anchoring fibrils, extended down from the lamina densa along the blister roof. Some basal and suprabasal keratinocytes contained large vesicles filled with filamentous matrix of variable electron density. Immunofluorescent staining of skin for type VII collagen showed sparse and irregular staining of type VII collagen along the blister roof, and intense intracellular labeling for type VII collagen in clusters of epidermal cells in basal and suprabasal layers. Type VII collagen appeared to be synthesized by keratinocytes but not secreted.\r"

In families with several cases, secondary cases (children infected in the home) had a relative mortality risk of 3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-5.80) compared with index cases who caught infection from someone outside the home. The case fatality rate (CFR) may be higher among secondary cases exposed to two or more index cases than among those exposed to only one index case (relative risk [RR] = 2.47; 95% CI: 0.93-6.56). The CFR was also higher among secondary cases exposed to a fatal index case than among those exposed to an index case who survived (RR = 4.69; 95% CI: 1.64-13.41). Children aged 12-23 months and those greater than or equal to 5 years were more likely than other age groups to have been infected by someone outside the home. During the course of the project the CFR in families with several cases was reduced from 8.8% to 2.7%. Though there is no general explanation for this tendency, it was observed that the proportion of secondary cases per index case was reduced during the last part of the project (odds ratio = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56-0.95).\r"

The cause was based on viral antigen detection, virus isolation, and antibody assays. There were 131 children (41.2%) who were admitted to the hospital, and 150 (47%) had an infiltrate on chest radiograph. A total of 198 viral infections were confirmed in 162 patients (51.9%), 42.3% with single viral infection and 9.6% with mixed (two or more) infection. The infections were measles (21.4%), influenza A (15.9%), parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3 (8.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (7.1%), influenza B (5.8%), enteroviruses (5.1%), adenoviruses (3.9%), herpes simplex virus (1.6%), and cytomegalovirus (1.3%). Viral infections other than measles were seen in 39.7% of the cases. The presence of viral infection correlated with better nutritional status. Influenza A or B diagnosis was associated with mild forms of acute respiratory tract infection, measles and a preceding rash with severe disease.\r"

Mice given rimantadine prophylactically plus therapeutically were resistant to rechallenge with virus at a dose equivalent to that used for the primary infection (50 pfu/mouse) but not to a high dose (1 x 10(5) pfu/mouse). Virus-neutralizing-antibody titers were reduced only by rimantadine treatment, which included prophylaxis, whereas the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was depressed by treatment given with or without prophylaxis. Mice infected with rimantadine-resistant virus had no decrease in CTL or antibody responses when treated with rimantadine. Therefore, the depression in CTL and antibody responses associated with rimantadine treatment appears to be due to a decrease in the amount of viral antigen available or interference with viral antigen processing and not to nonspecific immunosuppressive effects.\r"

Children aged 0-24 months were retrospectively divided into two groups based on HIV seroreactivity or nonreactivity at age 15 months and analyzed for the presence of antibodies that mediate cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and virus neutralization. No difference was seen in the presence of these functional antibodies between groups. The persistently seropositive group was further divided into non-AIDS and AIDS groups according to clinical status at serum collection. The ADCC antibody frequencies were much higher (70%) in the non-AIDS group than in the AIDS group (30%). Of the non-AIDS children, 63% had neutralizing antibodies; no children with AIDS had these antibodies. HIV-specific ADCC and neutralizing antibodies do not seem to protect against transmission of HIV from mother to child but are significantly correlated with a better clinical stage of childhood HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "The transfer of zidovudine (AZT) across human placenta was studied using an in vitro perfusion system with independent maternal and fetal circulations. AZT is transferred toward the fetus more rapidly than L-glucose (transfer index 1.5), a water-soluble molecule smaller than AZT (267 vs. 180 Da) that passively diffuses across the placenta. The transfer rate is proportional to the concentration in the maternal perfusate over a range of 0.03-300 microM. Transfer rate in the reverse direction, toward the maternal perfusate, also exceeds that of L-glucose and fails to show saturability. These observations are consistent with simple diffusion. The partition of AZT and glucose between perfusion buffer and octanol is 1.04 and 0.013, respectively, indicating that AZT is more lipophilic and providing a reasonable explanation for the more rapid transfer. AZT is extensively metabolized by the placenta to more polar and as yet unidentified metabolites that are not released into the perfusate. The possibility that the placental accumulation of such metabolite(s) may exert an antiviral action and may also affect placental function must be considered.\r"

Levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies reactive with several virus-encoded proteins including those reactive with the major envelope glycoprotein complex were significantly higher in cord serum and maternal delivery serum from the group of infants with clinically apparent infection than in serum from those with subclinical infection. Maternal delivery serum from the group with subclinical infection had significantly higher levels of IgM virus-binding antibody and lower levels of IgG virus-binding antibody than did the respective serum from the group with clinically apparent infection, suggesting maternal acquisition occurred later in gestation in the group with subclinical infection. These results suggested that deficiencies in the HCMV-specific antibody response were not associated with clinically apparent congenital infection and that other factors, such as early virus acquisition during pregnancy, might contribute to the severity of intrauterine HCMV infection.\r"

The effect of endotoxin-activated serum as a priming agent on human PMNL was tested. Pretreatment of PMNL with endotoxin-activated serum increased their oxidative burst in response to formylpeptide (FMLP) (P less than .02) and C5a (P less than .05). Priming for membrane depolarization was observed in PMNL preincubated with either endotoxin-activated serum, low concentrations of purified C5a, or endotoxin but not with decomplemented plasma. Primed PMNL had an increased number of FMLP but not C5a receptors as compared with control PMNL. The \"resting\" cytosolic free calcium was increased in primed PMNL (P less than .02). Intracellular calcium buffering abolished the priming effect of endotoxin-activated serum. Thus, endotoxin-activated serum can prime cellular responsiveness for membrane depolarization and superoxide production in response to FMLP and to C5a. Priming may be due to an increased resting cytosolic-free calcium.\r"

The effect of prior antimicrobial exposure was studied during a multistate outbreak of salmonellosis caused by an antimicrobial-sensitive strain of Salmonella havana: 19 (26%) of 72 persons infected had taken an antimicrobial within 30 days before onset of symptoms. Antimicrobial therapy was begun a mean of 15.9 days before and stopped a mean of 7.9 days before onset. In a case-control study, 11 (31%) of 35 case-patients had taken antimicrobials within 30 days of onset compared with 9 (13%) of 70 age- and neighborhood-matched controls (matched odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3, 13.5). The association remained when controlled for the presence of underlying illness or immunosuppression. Prior antimicrobial exposure appears to increase the risk of infection with antimicrobial-sensitive and resistant strains of Salmonella. The delay between antimicrobial use and onset of symptoms suggests that the effect may be due to prolonged alteration of the colonic bacterial flora, resulting in decreased resistance to colonization.\r"

The rate of transition from one hemadsorption phenotype to the other in broth cultures and NP organ culture supernatants was 3 x 10(-4) per bacterium per generation for HA+ to HA- and 7 x 10(-4) per bacterium per generation for HA- to HA+. Growth in human NP organ culture supernatants of the P+HA+ strain was greater than that of the P-HA- strain at 6 and 12 h after infection. No difference was noted when the strains were grown in nutrient broth. Strain 1009 (P+HA+) attached in large clusters to cellular debris and nonciliated cells, a phenomenon never noted with strain 1007 (P-HA-). NP organ cultures infected with strain 1007 showed greater mucosal invasion than those infected with the 1009 strain. While P+HA+ and P-HA- Hib both attached to NP mucosa, P+HA+ strains may have a selective advantage in mucosal colonization but P-HA- strains may be more invasive.\r"

The prevalence of serum antibodies in immunosuppressed patients varied at different institutions and was usually lower than that of healthy controls. Seven (41%) of 17 patients with single episodes of pneumocystosis and 13 (93%) of 14 patients with recurrent episodes followed sequentially developed active serum IgM and/or IgG antibody responses to the 40-kDa antigen. Serologic responses to P. carinii were also detected, though less frequently, by immunofluorescence. These data suggest that the 40-kDa antigen is a major marker of P. carinii infection and that immunoblotting is useful in measuring serum antibody responses to the organism in both normal and immunocompromised hosts.\r"

To compare possible virulence markers in isolates from women with and without colpitis macularis, isolates were analyzed for hemolytic activity, abscess production in an animal model, and adherence to cells in tissue culture. The mean hemolytic activity (relative to complete hemolysis) was 84% for 22 isolates from women with and 78% for 29 isolates from women without colpitis macularis. After subcutaneous injections in mice, abscesses were produced by 70% of isolates from patients with and 68% from patients without colpitis macularis. After a 15-min exposure, 39% of radiolabeled isolates from women with or without colpitis macularis adhered to HeLa cell monolayers.
