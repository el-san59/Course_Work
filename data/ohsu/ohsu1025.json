  ".W": "In order to support the hypothesis that oxygen free radicals derived from persistent sympathetic drive play an important role in the modulation of receptor-mediated effect in cardiac hypertrophy, rat hearts subjected to aortic banding-induced pressure overload were assessed on postoperative days 3, 14, and 28. Sham-operated rats without aortic banding were used as a control group. Cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors were increased at day 3 whereas beta-adrenoceptors were increased at postoperative days 14 and 28; these results were associated with increased amount of circulating norepinephrine and adrenolutin, one of the oxidation products of catecholamines. The hearts of these animals were also perfused by Langendorff technique in the presence and absence of adrenergic agonists. Banded animals had a diminished inotropic response to alpha agonists in addition to their reduced inotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimuli. These changes were however, reversible in animals pretreated with alpha-tocopherol, a powerful antioxidant. Furthermore, the circulating level of adrenolutin was normalized by such treatment. These results indicate that an oxidation product of catecholamines may be responsible for impaired inotropic responses to adrenergic stimulation following aortic constriction.\r"

Initially, the reproducibility of the authors' standardized fluorescein angiography was assessed by control angiograms on two different dates in each patient. Thereafter, prolonged use (six months) of isoxsuprine sustained release (80 mg/day) led to a nearly 50% reduction of the arterial filling time and a nearly 25% reduction of the arteriovenous filling time, whereas no changes were seen in control patients. This effect of isoxsuprine might be explained by an increase of red cell deformability and, concomitantly, a decrease of platelet adherence in the microcirculation of patients with diabetic mellitus.\r"

In vitro evaluation and in vivo canine and porcine testing were performed using this 'rheolytic' system to determine its feasibility in ablating calcified plaque and soft thrombotic tissue. A prototype rheolytic guidewire capable of providing 30,000 psi of internal pressure was designed to fit within the guidewire lumen of a standard percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter. An additional over-the-wire rheolytic catheter was fabricated to follow a standard .014-inch guidewire. The rheolytic devices were tested in vitro with simulated atheromatous and thrombotic lesions to evaluate the size and quantity of the particulate effluent. The particulate was then sterilized, mixed with saline, and introduced percutaneously into the animal kidney and heart for evaluation. The in vitro studies demonstrated that the rheolytic catheter and guidewire were able to follow both a coronary and femoral arterial model and successfully ablate the simulated lesions. The particle size for osseous, muscular, and cartilagenous tissue ranged from 2 to 6 micrometers; for fresh human plaque the particles ranged from 2 to 15 micrometers. Injection of cartilagenous and plaque particles into the animal model caused very slight regions of necrosis but no clinical sequelae. Applications of the rheolytic devices to the animal femoral artery demonstrated that both devices could ablate and cross calified or soft thrombosed lesions without damage to the vessel wall; the rheolytic catheter provided a debulking of the plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors compared coronary angiography and left ventriculography with thallium 201 tomography using oral dipyridamole to identify patients with potential ischemia in the infarct zone indicating viable tissue. Forty-five patients (37 men, 8 women) with acute myocardial infarctions (29 anterior, 16 inferior) who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy were studied. On the basis of the left ventriculograms, only 16 patients were judged to have residual function in the infarct zone. Six of these patients had no thallium redistribution in the infarct zone, indicating lack of residual ischemia. Of the 29 patients with no residual function in the infarct zone, 18 had redistribution in the infarct zone, suggesting residual ischemic myocardium and thus viable tissue. Among the 32 patients with open infarct vessels, 15 had no redistribution in the infarct zone, but of the remaining 13 patients with occluded infarct vessels, 9 had redistribution in the infarct zone indicating residual ischemia and thus viable tissue. The authors' data suggest that neither wall motion analysis by left ventriculography nor the angiographic status of the infarct vessel identifies those patients with residual ischemia as evidenced by thallium tomography using oral dipyridamole.\r"

The present study was designed to evaluate with methacholine bronchial challenge small children (between 2 and 6 years of age) with the diagnosis of or a suspected diagnosis of asthma, utilizing a new method of evaluating airflow in small children through sound analysis, Computer Digitized Airway Phonopneumography (CDAP). There were 23 children in the study between the ages of 2 and 6 years with suspected asthma who could not perform pulmonary function tests. A control group consisting of 12 subjects between the ages of 8 and 38 years of age with a history of chronic cough and/or wheezing who could perform pulmonary function tests was also studied. Of the 12 patients over the age of 8 who had MBC, 11 of them had positive challenges with a fall in FEV1 of 19% or greater. The percent change in sound intensity levels from baseline range from 232% to 396% of baseline. There was greater than 200% change in mean intensity levels with a concentration of methacholine that produced a 19% fall in FEV1 in all of the eleven patients. For one individual who had a negative MBC there was only a 16% change in pulmonary function at 25 mg of methacholine with essentially no change in sound intensity level from baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of this survey demonstrate that clinical scoring systems are not commonly used while pulmonary function tests are frequently obtained on symptomatic patients with bronchial asthma.

We gave oral slow-release theophylline and placebo to each subject for seven days in two series of experiments in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. The individual daily dose of theophylline (4.7 to 16.6 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses) was calculated for each subject by measuring individual theophylline clearance and optimal daily dosage. During treatment with placebo, the subjects developed dual asthmatic reactions, ie, FEV1 decreased from 4.1 +/- 0.17 L before bronchoprovocation to 3.2 +/- 0.14 L at 15 minutes and to 3.2 +/- 0.19 L at seven hours after allergen bronchoprovocation. By contrast, during active treatment FEV1 decreased from 4.2 +/- 0.28 L to 3.9 +/- 0.26 L at 15 minutes, and to 3.8 +/- 0.13 L at seven hours (both cases, P less than .03 compared with placebo). Mean serum theophylline concentration was 13.2 +/- 0.6 mg/L. Although 1 week's treatment with slow-release theophylline did not modify significantly either prechallenge airway responsiveness to methacholine or its increase after allergen inhalation challenge, in five out of six subjects theophylline significantly inhibited the increase of airway responsiveness to methacholine induced by allergens compared to placebo and control day (P less than .05). These results suggest that slow-release theophylline may inhibit allergen-induced asthmatic reactions and the associated increase of airway responsiveness, suggesting some antiinflammatory effects for this drug.\r"

A significantly lower early postoperative IOP with less frequent severe pressure spikes occurred in the apraclonidine-treated patients.

The rabbit injected with thrombin alone died within 30 seconds due to total intravascular coagulation. Three additional rabbits injected with thrombin but treated with heparin (intraperitoneally 40 minutes before thrombin, intravenously 30 minutes before thrombin, and intravenously immediately after thrombin injection) survived without any ill effects noted over the next month. For extraocular cases we recommend color coding the thrombin with some methylene blue. Using an eye dropper, rather than a syringe, reduces the chance of intravascular injection.\r"

The protracted ocular pain was mainly due to: end-stage (absolute) glaucoma in 31 (80%) eyes, uveitis or endophthalmitis in four (10%) eyes, or corneal ulcer in two (5%) eyes. One eye had painful phthisis bulbi, and one eye had infraorbital neuralgia. The complications encountered were transient and included blepharoptosis in eight (21%) eyes, external ophthalmoplegia, and corneal epithelial defect. The effective time of the injection to relieve pain ranged from two weeks to two years (mean, 29 weeks). The authors believe that there is still a place for retrobulbar alcohol injection for blind painful eyes when enucleation or evisceration is not possible.\r"

We report such a case in a cataractous eye with a vitreous hemorrhage undergoing panretinal photocoagulation.

This preliminary report confirms that in some of these children with SIDS, particularly around the age of 3 months, there is a potentially lethal reduction in subglottic airway secondary to an increase in mucus-secreting glands, possibly from an associated mild upper respiratory tract infection. Accepting that adequate control infants within this age group who have not had any trauma to the laryngotracheal area are not available, these findings offer a possible explanation for what are always tragic events.\r"

Recurrent or persistent disease was eventually demonstrated in all patients with positive margins. The 2-year determinant disease-free survival rate for stage I and II disease was 85%. Three-year disease-free survival was 50% for stage III and IV disease. Partial laryngectomies, including supraglottic, can be done after irradiation failure with a high expectation of cure and acceptable morbidity. Immediate additional operation should be considered in patients with positive margins.\r"

Apparently it is caused by obstruction of previously pneumatized temporal bone air cells. Surgical cure is achieved by drainage and reestablishment of normal pneumatization. This paper reviews 14 cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone, emphasizing the importance of preoperative imaging and surgical approach. Use of magnetic resonance imaging differentiates cholesterol cysts from cholesteatoma or other neoplasms. Computed tomography delineates the location of the lesion and defines temporal bone anatomy essential to surgical approach. The two studies together allow the surgeon to properly plan drainage, as in the case of a cholesterol cyst, versus excision or exteriorization, as in the case of cholesteatoma. The infralabyrinthine approach to a petrous apex cholesterol cyst is the procedure of choice when hearing preservation is desired.\r"

Handicapped males were much more likely to be victims of sexual abuse than nonhandicapped males in the general population. Children being educated in residential schools were more likely to be sexually abused than mainstreamed youngsters. These children may be at risk for abuse from a wide variety of potential perpetrators, including teachers, dormitory counselors, van drivers, clergy, classroom aides, older students, peer siblings, scout leaders, abused peers, baby-sitters, and custodians.\r"

Specifically, tremendous torques are generated by each of these devices when they are introduced into the coil of a magnetic resonance imager; in addition, the 3M products not only were noted to induce an electrical current, but also were significantly magnetized and rendered afunctional.

The diameters of the endolymphatic duct and the proximal portion of the vestibular aqueduct were significantly smaller in Meniere's disease ears than in controls. Graphic reconstructions showed the Meniere's sacs to be smaller and to have fewer tubular epithelial structures in the intraosseous portion than in the control ears. The median volume of the sac in the Meniere's disease side was substantially lower than in the contralateral ear. The width of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was significantly smaller in Meniere's disease ears than in controls. These findings indicate that the size not only of the vestibular aqueduct but also of the sac is reduced in Meniere's disease. The results may suggest that the endolymphatic sac is pathologically changed in Meniere's disease and that a reduced resorptive capacity of a small endolymphatic sac could result in endolymphatic hydrops.\r"

  ".W": "A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) study on 55 patients with surgically confirmed clinical otosclerosis confirms the existence of cochlear otospongiosis among the Chinese. Positive radiographic results of cochlear otospongiosis (13 ears, 12%) were found in patients with mixed-type deafness but in none with conductive hearing loss. Although there is a positive correlation between audiologic and radiographic findings, the HRCT results showed a lower positive rate and less severity than anticipated from the audiologic results. However, compared with the occurrence and extension of radiographic findings in similar studies of white people, it would seem to support our previous contention that the disease is indeed milder in Chinese people. Cochlear otospongiosis with extensive labyrinthine demineralization was found in three young patients with rapidly progressive hearing loss. This is important evidence of the overlooked fact that cochlear otospongiosis may also be one of the causes of sensorineural hearing loss in the Chinese. Thus, a high index of suspicion of the existence of this inner ear disorder is of paramount importance, and in such cases an HRCT study should be performed and sodium fluoride given to prevent further hearing deterioration.\r"

  ".W": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important bacterial pathogen in the pathophysiology of otitis media. To elucidate the inflammatory responses that occur during pneumococcal otitis media, the kinetics of the biochemical and cytologic middle ear responses to heat-killed encapsulated and nonencapsulated pneumococci were studied in the chinchilla model. Inoculation of the middle ear cavity with at least 10(6) S pneumoniae cells induced an early, brief vascular response with leakage of small (albumin) followed by larger (alpha 2-macroglobulin) proteins, followed by sustained influx of acute inflammatory cells and lysozyme. The threshold for a sustained lysozyme response was 1,000 times lower for nonencapsulated than for encapsulated pneumococci. These results indicate that nonviable S pneumoniae organisms with an intact envelope initiate the middle ear inflammatory response. Therefore, interventions that enhance the clearance of pneumococcal cells from the middle ear may reduce the inflammatory response and prevent chronic middle ear inflammation.\r"

Endolymphatic infusion caused pressure increases in both the endolymphatic and the perilymphatic spaces, but no measurable pressure difference between them. Soon after the endolymphatic infusion, both pressures returned nearly to the initial levels. We conclude that 1) the endolymphatic and the perilymphatic pressures are very closely related, and 2) if a physiologically significant pressure difference exists between endolymph and perilymph in endolymphatic hydrops, it is below the resolving power of the methods used in this study (+/- 0.1 mm Hg).\r"

Nonetheless, the difficulty in isolating putative pathogens from cellulitic skin has served to cast doubt on this hypothesis. In this regard, the skin is provided with a unique set of lymphoid and reticular cells with the capacity to secrete lymphokines and cytokines. These substances rapidly reduce the number of viable bacteria from infection by enhancing the infiltration of skin by circulating macrophages and neutrophils. The warmth and erythema associated with cellulitis are most likely produced both by a small number of residual bacteria and by fragmented bacterial remnants, and amplified by the lymphokines that are secreted in response to antigenic challenge. Anti-inflammatory agents may play a significant role in enhancing the resolution of infection by reducing the production of soluble mediators by these intra-epidermal immunocompetent cells.\r"

The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of intracellular polyglutamation and prolonged retention of methotrexate within the cell. Piritrexim isethionate is a lipid-soluble antifolate that has a mechanism of action similar to that of methotrexate. Since it is not polyglutamated, piritrexim could be effective in the treatment of psoriasis without the associated long-term hepatotoxicity. A 12-week phase I/II clinical trial of severe chronic plaque psoriasis assessed the safety and efficacy of oral piritrexim therapy. Based on experience gained from oncologic trials, each patient received a twice-daily dosage for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks. Dosages ranged from 25 to 100 mg twice a day. Improvement in both lesion scores and percentage of body involvement was significant at a dose of 50 mg or more twice daily. Fifteen of 19 patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy demonstrated greater than 50% improvement in lesion scores. Improvement was limited by recrudescence of lesions over the 9-day rest period. Adverse experiences were minimal and dose related. Piritrexim is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis.\r"

We used azathioprine in the treatment of six patients with cutaneous LE, four of whom had subacute cutaneous (nonscarring) LE and two of whom had chronic cutaneous (scarring, discoid) LE, and six patients with chronic cutaneous LV. The conditions of all patients had been resistant to conventional therapy, and they required long-term oral corticosteroid therapy for control of their disease. Two of the patients with LE had prominent palmar and/or plantar involvement. Three patients with LE had an excellent response to azathioprine, with near complete clearing of the skin lesions, allowing a decrease in prednisone dosage. One patient with LE initially demonstrated significant improvement, but azathioprine therapy had to be discontinued because of pancreatitis. The treatment failed in two patients with LE; one had nausea and the other repeatedly developed a drug-induced fever. Five of the six patients with LV had improved conditions, with complete control of the disease occurring in two patients and partial control in three patients. Azathioprine is effective for some patients with cutaneous LE and chronic cutaneous LV, but it should be reserved for patients with severe disease in whom more conventional treatment fails.\r"

A distinctive population of perifollicular spindle-shaped cells in the midportion of the follicle (ie, bulge area), which is the site of the putative hair follicle stem cells, were CD34 positive, as were spindle-shaped cells in and around the eccrine glands accentuating their basement membrane zone. In patch/plaque--and tumor-stage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, CD34 expression was present on both the proliferating endothelial cells as well as the spindle-shaped stromal cells. CD34 positive endothelial cells and spindle-shaped stromal cells may play important participatory and supportive functions in both normal and diseased skin.\r"

On the helix, a longitudinal incision was made; on the antihelix, a flap was raised and the underlying cartilage was excised, taking care to leave no rough cartilage edges. Follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 4.5 to 34 months) showed that 10 of 17 antihelix lesions and 24 of 29 helix lesions healed completely with excellent cosmetic results. Recurrences, requiring further treatment, occurred at cartilage-excision margins in seven ears, and further cartilage excision alone was successful in four ears. This study demonstrates that only cartilage needs to be removed in the surgical treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis.\r"

  ".W": "The varying epidermal melanin content that produces racial pigmentation determines the number of photons that reach the lower (malpighian) cellular layers, where vitamin D3 synthesis takes place. We investigated the effect of racial pigmentation on vitamin D3 formation, stimulating the process with a fixed dose of UVB radiation (wavelengths, 290 to 320 nm). Vitamin D nutritional status was further assessed measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the most active serum metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Experimental subjects were young (third decade of life) and healthy, representing the white, Oriental (East Asian), Indian (South Asian), and black races. Basal serum vitamin D3 levels were similar among groups, ranging from 2.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM) for blacks to 3.4 +/- 1.0 nmol/L for Indians. Following whole-body exposure to 27 mJ/cm2 of UVB, there was a significant racial group effect on serum vitamin D3 levels. Post-UVB levels were significantly higher in whites (31.4 +/- 4.4 nmol/L) than in Indians or blacks (12.8 +/- 2.9 and 9.1 +/- 2.1 nmol/L, respectively), while the levels in Orientals (27.8 +/- 4.4 nmol/L) differed significantly from those in blacks and Indians but not in whites. Race had only a marginal effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, with higher levels in whites than in blacks (69.9 +/- 12.7 vs 29.7 +/- 6.2 nmol/L). Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and vitamin D binding protein levels were similar in all groups. We conclude that while racial pigmentation has a photoprotective effect, it does not prevent the generation of normal levels of active vitamin D metabolites.\r"

Histologic signs of human papillomavirus infection were seen in all premalignant and malignant lesions. Furthermore, human papillomavirus type 1 DNA was detected by in situ molecular hybridization within one of the carcinomas. Human papillomaviruses, along with other carcinogenic factors, play an important role in the development of carcinomas, and benign types could be implicated.

The amalgam in the mouth influenced mercury levels in whole blood (B-Hg), plasma, and urine. The association was nonlinear: the more amalgam, the larger the relative increase in mercury levels. The number of amalgam surfaces accounted for more of the variance in blood and urine mercury levels than did the number of fillings (e.g., U-Hg: 44% and 36%, respectively). The estimated increases in mercury level with rising amalgam load were 3.0%, 2.0%, and 0.8% per filled surface for U-Hg, P-Hg, and B-Hg, respectively (p less than .0001 in all cases). The impact of occupational exposure on U-Hg in the dental personnel corresponded to approximately 19 amalgam surfaces. Ceramo metallic restorations were associated with higher (31%) U-Hg.\r"

Vital status of 9,677 applicators and 9,727 instructors was determined through January 1, 1980, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated. The overall SMR was 127 for applicators (699 deaths) and 93 for instructors (454 deaths). Fatalities from nonmotor vehicle accidents, mostly aircraft crashes, were in notable excess (SMR = 1,168 among applicators, 630 among instructors), whereas deaths from most chronic diseases, including all cancer, was below expectation (e.g., for arteriosclerotic heart disease, SMR = 52 among applicators and 50 among instructors). The ability of the study to assess cancer risk among applicators was limited by a relatively brief follow-up period. However, 8 applicators (SMR = 171), but only 1 flight instructor (SMR = 24), died of leukemia, and small, nonsignificant risk elevations for some other cancer sites among applicators were observed and warrant continued follow-up.\r"

We found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 1.4) and a slight, nonsignificant excess for leukemia (RR = 1.2) among individuals who lived .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks were greater for certain histologic types: follicular lymphoma (RR = 1.5), acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 5.4), and acute myelocytic leukemia (RR = 2.2). For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (but not for leukemia), the relative risks for those living within .8 km (1/2 mile) of a factory were similar or slightly larger than for those living .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks did not increase with duration of residence near a factory. The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities. The risk of developing leukemia was greater among persons who resided near chemical and petroleum plants. These preliminary findings raise the possibility that general environmental exposure associated with certain industrial activities may elevate the risk of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Evaluation of data on proximity to industrial plants from studies in other geographic locations is needed to determine whether our results represent a meaningful association.\r"

Cancer incidence was followed through to the end of 1985 by computerized linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry, and Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on incidence rates for the Danish population. For the entire cohort, significantly elevated SMRs were seen for all cancers (SMR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18) and lung cancer (SMR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12-1.51), and SMRs were at the borderline of statistical significance for bladder cancer (SMR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97-1.59). Excess lung and bladder cancer risk were confined to workers who had worked in foundries for at least 20 y. There was a positive correlation between silicosis prevalence in employees at the foundries at the time of the x-ray examinations and lung cancer incidence during the follow-up period. Squamous cell carcinomas, anaplastic carcinomas, and other lung cancers accounted for the excess lung cancer risk, whereas there was not excess risk among the foundry workers for adenocarcinomas of the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The association between silicosis and lung cancer mortality was estimated in 9,912 (369 silicotics and 9,543 nonsilicotics) white male metal miners. These miners were examined by the U.S. Public Health Service during 1959-1961 and were followed through 1975. Miners were excluded from this study if they were employed in a mine during 1959-1961 that used diesel equipment underground. The ores that were mined consisted of copper, lead-zinc, iron, mercury, lead silver, gold and gold-silver, tungsten, and molybenum. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR, U.S. white male rates) for lung cancer was 1.73 (95% CI: .94-2.90) in silicotics and 1.18 (95% CI: .98-1.42) in nonsilicotics. Additionally, SMRs were higher in silicotics than in nonsilicotics, even in most subgroups stratified by cigarette smoking habit, type of ore mined, years of service in an underground job, radon exposure group, or year of hire. When lung cancer mortality between silicotics and nonsilicotics was compared, the age-adjusted rate ratio (95% CI) was 1.56 (.91-2.68), and the age- and smoking-adjusted rate ratio was 1.96 (.98-3.67). Corresponding figures for miners who were employed in mines with low levels of radon exposure were 1.90 (.98-3.67) and 2.59 (1.44-4.68), respectively. These findings indicate that lung cancer mortality risk was increased in silicotics, and this probably did not result from chance or bias. However, confounding from radon exposure could not be ruled out. The findings indicate that further follow-up of this cohort is needed.\r"

Utah and Salt Lake valleys had high levels of PM10 pollution that violated both the annual and 24-h standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Much lower PM10 levels occurred in the Cache Valley. Utah Valley experienced the intermittent operation of its primary source of PM10 pollution: an integrated steel mill. Bronchitis and asthma admissions for preschool-age children were approximately twice as frequent in Utah Valley when the steel mill was operating versus when it was not. Similar differences were not observed in Salt Lake or Cache valleys. Even though Cache Valley had higher smoking rates and lower temperatures in winter than did Utah Valley, per capita bronchitis and asthma admissions for all ages were approximately twice as high in Utah Valley. During the period when the steel mill was closed, differences in per capita admissions between Utah and Cache valleys narrowed considerably. Regression analysis also demonstrated a statistical association between respiratory hospital admissions and PM10 pollution. The results suggest that PM10 pollution plays a role in the incidence and severity of respiratory disease.\r"

A strong positive correlation (r = .65, p less than .0001) between the amount smoked and the nicotine concentration in the house dust was found when the results from all homes were analyzed, and a fairly strong positive correlation (r = .35, p less than .05) was found for smokers' homes only. These data suggest that the nonsmoker may inhale tobacco constituents from respirable dust, even if smoking does not occur. The amount of nicotine inhaled during 1 h was estimated for someone in one of the homes where there was a high nicotine concentration in the house dust. The calculated amount, 12 ng, is very small compared with the amount inhaled when active smoking occurs (i.e., 600-3,000 ng/h). In this study, nicotine was a marker of tobacco pollution. Assuming that other tobacco smoke agents have a similar or smaller affinity to house dust as that of nicotine, we conclude that house dust inhalation constitutes only a modest additional source of involuntary smoking.\r"

  ".W": "There has been much debate about the mechanism by which thyroid hormone leaves the circulation and enters cells. Critical to the development of theoretical models of thyroid hormone uptake are precise estimates of the kinetic constants describing the reversible binding of the hormone to its binding proteins. A resin capture method was modified to permit the collection of dissociation data at intervals of 0.12 sec. Columns (30 X 0.6 cm) of Amberlite IRA 400 anion exchange resin were perfused at 30 ml/min with 3.5% dextran in modified Krebs Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 C. Injection of [125I]triiodothyronine (T3) tracer in BSA-free medium established the rate constant for resin capture of free T3 in this system: kRes = 0.89 +/- 0.04 sec-1 (mean +/- SD, n = 4). [125I]T3 preequilibrated with BSA was infused to achieve final BSA concentrations of 2.3, 48, 120, 290, 507, and 725 microM, yielding apparent uptake rate constants (kapp) of 0.77 +/- 0.12 (n = 6), 0.23 +/- 0.01 (n = 4), 0.17 +/- 0.04 (n = 4), 0.057 +/- 0.005 (n = 4), 0.039 +/- 0.003 (n = 4), 0.020 +/- 0.002 (n = 4) sec-1 (SSE less than 9.4 X 10(-2), respectively, when fitted by nonlinear methods. Solving the equation kapp = kRes/(1 + [BSA]/KD') gave KD' = 1.80 +/- 0.07 X 10(-5) M (r2 = 0.96, P less than 0.001, n = 26) where KD' is the apparent or flow equilibrium constant. In a further experiment T3:BSA reassociation was eliminated by BSA dilution. This resulted in determination of the dissociation rate constant kdissoc = 0.63 +/- 0.16 sec-1 (n = 8) and therefore, the association rate constant kassoc = 3.5 X 10(4) M-1 sec-1. Mathematical modeling predicted that 14.4 microM BSA would decrease the rate of T3 uptake by the resin system by 65%. The free fraction of T3 during a single pass extraction was predicted to be greater than that measured by equilibrium dialysis, suggesting that dissociation of T3 from BSA is favored in the flux model relative to that measured at equilibrium in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blockers are among the most effective antiischemic therapies currently available. These agents afford a reduction in vascular smooth muscle tone by interrupting the excitation-contraction coupling process dependent on calcium transport. The efficacy of calcium channel blockers in patients with myocardial ischemia is probably due in large part to their effects on coronary circulation. In experimental models of coronary occlusion, these agents have been demonstrated to increase coronary vasodilation and coronary blood flow. Recruitment of coronary vasodilator reserve by nifedipine has been demonstrated indirectly via enhancement of left ventricular function in a canine model. Additionally, calcium channel blockers have been shown to modify the reactive hyperemic response usually seen after coronary artery occlusion. These changes in coronary resistance vessels, which normally regulate myocardial blood flow in response to metabolic requirements, have important clinical implications. Larger collateral vessels are also affected by calcium channel blockers, although the results observed in experimental models are not as clear cut. Although techniques for measuring coronary blood flow in humans are more limited, considerable data have accumulated on the effects of calcium channel blockers in humans. Assessments of coronary vasodilation using quantitative angiography have produced variable results. However, improved myocardial perfusion, as measured by thallium-201 scintigraphy after administration of nifedipine, and beneficial effects on coronary blood flow and coronary vascular resistance as assessed using the precordial xenon-133 washout technique before and after sublingual administration of nifedipine have been observed. Overall, such studies have not only shown the clinical usefulness of calcium channel blockers, but have broadened our understanding about the complex interplay of their mechanisms of action.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers have specific effects on renal hemodynamics in patients with hypertension and may also slow the progression of chronic renal failure. When these agents are studied in vitro, their predominant effect is to reverse afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by catecholamines or angiotensin II. Because efferent resistance may remain high, glomerular filtration rate rises while renal blood flow remains low. The effects in vivo are less consistent. In human hypertension, calcium channel blockers lower renal resistance and may raise both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In experimental models of chronic renal disease, calcium channel blockers slow the progression of renal damage; however, variable effects on renal hemodynamics have been found. Other factors implicated in the progression of renal damage, including compensatory renal hypertrophy, platelet aggregation, and calcium deposition, may also be favorably influenced by these agents. Recent studies suggest that calcium channel blockers may have similar protective effects in patients with hypertension and chronic renal disease.\r"

Fourteen patients failed to complete 6 months of therapy. For the 25 who remained in treatment for 6 months or more, systolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions were 62 +/- 5/40 +/- 2 mm Hg at 6 months; for those followed more than 12 months (n = 18), 58 +/- 7/37 +/- 3 mm Hg at 12 months; and for those followed more than 18 months (n = 11), 54 +/- 6/37 +/- 3 mm Hg at 18 months. Overall, 75% of these severely hypertensive patients were controlled with nifedipine GITS alone; 80% required 90 mg/day or more. During the two years of observation, no patient had a severe medical event, and 44% of those who entered remain in treatment. Left ventricular hypertrophy, as determined by echocardiography, diminished significantly during the course of treatment. These results indicate nifedipine GITS is well-tolerated and effective as monotherapy in the treatment of severe hypertension.\r"

In this study conducted at 127 centers, 1155 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension representative of the spectrum seen in practice were included in the analyses of effectiveness. After a 2 week placebo period, nifedipine GITS therapy was started at 30 mg/day and was titrated to a maximum dose of 180 mg/day over 6 weeks. Response criteria were a sitting diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. After titration, patients were observed for 12 weeks during treatment. At the final visit, nifedipine GITS significantly (P less than .0001) reduced sitting systolic blood pressure 17 +/- 14 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), and sitting diastolic blood pressure 14 +/- 8 mm Hg. Similar highly significant reductions in standing blood pressure were observed. For all subjects, 76% achieved goal blood pressure response during titration. More than 50% were controlled on doses of 30 to 60 mg/day. At the final visit blood pressure reductions in men and women were similar, except for a significantly greater decrease in sitting systolic pressure for women. A similar proportion of blacks responded compared with whites, and reductions in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also similar in the 2 groups. Nifedipine GITS had no effect on renal function, serum potassium, or total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol. Uric acid was reduced by 0.5 mg/dL (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This analysis compares the safety and efficacy of nifedipine GITS in elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years of age) and nonelderly patients (adults less than 65 years of age). A total of 222 elderly and 933 nonelderly patients from 127 centers were evaluated.

Newer agents including calcium channel blockers, which exert potent antihypertensive effects without adversely affecting metabolic parameters unfavorably, are used with increasing frequency in hypertensive patients, but their clinical utility has been limited by the need for multiple daily dosing with attendant fluctuations in plasma levels thought to be associated with nuisance side effects and possible gaps in therapeutic protection. The Modern Approach to the Treatment of Hypertension (MATH) trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of the new once-daily nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation in a large cohort of mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients overall, and to identify specific effects of therapy in the presence of complicating factors such as diabetes and obesity.

They include efficacy, safety, comorbidity, utility in special populations, drug interaction, dosage schedule, cost, the mechanisms of action of the drug, and the pathophysiology of the patient's hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are effective and safe in the elderly. They improve other conditions frequently seen in that population and, with the exception of cardiac conduction abnormalities associated with some calcium channel blockers, do not adversely affect other comorbid diseases. They work well together with other antihypertensives and as vasodilators, they may be specifically appropriate in elderly hypertensives, whose hypertension is associated with reduced cardiac output and increased peripheral vascular resistance. Once- and twice-a-day preparations are available to foster compliance, but calcium channel blockers are expensive.\r"

  ".W": "The frequent concurrence of other cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, suggests that overlapping genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the common metabolic and cardiovascular derangements observed in these populations. Hypertension and hyperglycemia accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetics, and play an important role in associated morbidity and mortality. Several abnormalities in blood pressure regulatory systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and sodium/volume control have been described in diabetes mellitus. Sodium retention and cardiovascular hyperreactivity appear to occur early in the course of diabetes mellitus, even at normal blood pressure levels and before onset of renal failure, and could set the stage for the development of hypertension. The relationship between obesity and hypertension is also well-established, and may reflect metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations in obese subjects which predispose to blood pressure elevations. Obese subjects display changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, sodium metabolism, and vascular hemodynamics. Sodium-sensitive blood pressure responses in the obese may be secondary to increased cardiac output or fluid volume, and are directly related to circulating insulin levels. Certain metabolic and vascular characteristics of obesity and diabetes mellitus are found in patients with essential hypertension. It has been suggested that insulin and insulin resistance may be the common link between these risk factors. Improved understanding of metabolic considerations in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives should lead to more careful selection of medications that avoid metabolic complications. Although diuretics and beta-blockers may be useful in some patients, there are several reasons not to recommend their use as initial therapy in obese and diabetic hypertensives. On the other hand, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are highly effective, with minimal effects on metabolic parameters, and are well-suited as first-line therapy in the treatment of obese and diabetic hypertensives.\r"

Although black hypertensives exhibit enhanced sodium retention, expanded plasma volume, lower plasma renin activity, and a greater increase in blood pressure in response to high levels of Na+ intake compared with nonblack hypertensives, there is considerable heterogeneity in these studies. Alterations in ion transport mechanisms, such as a decrease in Na+K(+)-ATPase activity and Na+K+ cotransport, have been demonstrated in the black hypertensive population. Those features provide the physiologic basis for the differential response to monotherapy with diuretics and, perhaps, with calcium channel blockers, that is observed in black hypertensives, particularly when compared with responses to beta-blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma ionized calcium levels have been shown to be lower than normotensive control levels in hypertensive patients with low plasma renin activity and higher than control levels in hypertensive patients with high renin activity; they did not differ between high and low plasma renin activity groups of normotensive controls. To see if ionized calcium may have different relationships with blood pressure across renin categories in normotensive individuals, plasma ionized calcium was measured on 875 healthy individuals, ages 3 to 83, who had never been diagnosed as having hypertension. Blood pressures were measured in the sitting, standing, and supine positions, along with pressures measured during two stress maneuvers: isometric handgrip and a 50 degrees tilt from a supine position. There was no linear correlation of blood pressure with plasma ionized calcium in the entire sample of youths or adults. However, after dividing the adults into tertiles based on plasma renin activity, there were significant inverse correlations between ionized calcium and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the low renin group (r = -0.16 to -0.25, P less than or equal to .05), while the systolic blood pressure correlations were significantly positive in the high renin group (r = 0.14 to 0.22, P less than or equal to .05). Adults with normal renin levels did not have any significant correlations of plasma ionized calcium with blood pressure. These confounding effects of renin were greater for systolic than for diastolic blood pressure. These correlations within renin tertiles occurred even though there were no differences in mean blood pressure, plasma ionized calcium, total plasma protein and plasma sodium across renin categories.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between arterial blood pressure and red blood cell variables was investigated in 1013 unselected persons with a blood pressure range of 90 to 225 mm Hg systolic and 50 to 145 mm Hg diastolic. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between mean (as well as systolic and diastolic) arterial blood pressure and red blood cell count (r = 0.27; P less than .0001), hematocrit (r = 0.28; P less than .0001), and hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.29; P less than .0001). Average arterial blood pressure was higher in men than in women (133 +/- 16/83 +/- 10 v 124 +/- 16/79 +/- 9 mm Hg, P less than .0001) and this was associated with higher values for erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit in men as compared to women. The significant correlation of blood pressure and hematocrit, which represents one important determinant of blood viscosity, points to a role for rheological factors in the long-term control of blood pressure. Moreover, it might be speculated that the sex difference in blood pressure as observed in the present study may be due, at least in part, to stimulated erythropoiesis in men as compared to women.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess the blood pressure profile of chronic renal failure in comparison with essential hypertension. Thirty hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure due to non-vascular nephropathies were matched by age, sex, and mean 24 h blood pressure, with 30 patients affected by uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. They were studied in an open hospital ward. Diet, meal times, sleep times, and activity schedules were standardized. Noninvasive, automatic, blood pressure recordings were performed for 48 h at sampling intervals of 15 min. The mean 24 h blood pressure almost coincided in the two groups. However, in essential hypertension a mean (+/- SD) nocturnal fall of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found (12.7 +/- 3.8 and 12.9 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, respectively), while renal patients displayed an average nocturnal increase of 2.7 +/- 8.9 mm Hg and 3.7 +/- 7.8 (P less than .001). The renal patients had also higher heart rates, with a significantly blunted nocturnal fall (4.4 +/- 4.5 beats/min as compared to 9.3 +/- 3.1 beats/min of essential hypertension; P less than .001). Among the renal patients, the day-night blood pressure changes showed no significant correlation with age, creatinine clearance, hematocrit, nocturnal change in heart rate, or day or night mean blood pressure levels. These data suggest that an abnormal day-night pattern of blood pressure is present in chronic renal failure patients independently from external interfering factors. Hence, casual measurements of blood pressure confined to daytime may underestimate a hypertensive condition associated with chronic renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Intraarterial blood pressure (BP) monitoring during free ambulation (Oxford technique) was carried out in 12 essential mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients undergoing 4 weeks treatment with felodipine, 10 mg given once daily in an extended release formulation. Compared to placebo, felodipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout 24 h. The greatest reduction was observed at 10 AM, 3 h after drug administration (-32 +/- 6/-24 +/- 5 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, P less than .001). Hourly BP values remained significantly lower up to and including the 24th hour during felodipine extended release treatment (-18 +/- 5/-11 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than .001). Felodipine extended release also reduced 24 h blood pressure variability, evaluated on the standard deviation of each hourly mean (from 16.3 +/- 0.9/12.6 +/- 0.6 to 13.4 +/- 0.6/10.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, P less than .01). Furthermore, absolute BP values dropped significantly at the peaks of dynamic exercise (bicycle ergometer: from 248 +/- 13/123 +/- 11 to 204 +/- 24/102 +/- 13 mm Hg, P less than .001), isometric exercise (hand grip: from 232 +/- 18/133 +/- 16 to 180 +/- 20/101 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .001), and cold pressor test (from 229 +/- 20/127 +/- 14 to 178 +/- 22/99 +/- 15 mm Hg, P less than .001). In conclusion, felodipine extended release exerts a good antihypertensive effect which is maintained for 24 h and reduces the level of blood pressure peaks reached under different physical stresses.\r"

  ".W": "Previous results have shown that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and hypertriglyceridemic as compared to Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Since SHR rats also have higher blood pressures than WKY rats, the current study was initiated in an attempt to evaluate the relationship between the magnitude of blood pressure and the differences in insulin and lipid metabolism seen in SHR and WKY rats. The experimental variables to be compared were determined in three groups of SHR and WKY rats, varying in age: Group I rats were 6 to 7 weeks of age; Group II rats were 8 to 9 weeks old; whereas Group III rats were 12 to 13 weeks of age. Maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport by adipocytes isolated from SHR rats was significantly lower (P less than .005) than isolated adipocytes from WKY rats in all three groups, whereas plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher (P less than .005). Blood pressure was also higher in SHR than in WKY rats within each group. Since absolute values for maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake did not change statistically as the rats grew older, the magnitude of the decrease in SHR rats was similar in each group. The increase in plasma insulin and triglyceride concentration observed in SHR rats was also the same in each group, but the absolute values increased with age in both SHR and WKY rats. However, blood pressure rose significantly with age in SHR, but not WKY rats, leading to a progressive increase in the degree of hypertension in SHR rats. These results support the view that hypertension, per se, does not lead to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Aorta synthesized epinine by the N-methylation of dopamine (DA) about 3 times as well as it synthesized E from NE. In contrast, adrenal homogenates which contain phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) methylated DA only 1% as well as NE. The PNMT inhibitor SKF 29661 had no significant effect on methylation of NE by aorta but inhibited adrenal PNMT by 88%. N-Methylating activity in arterial homogenates was increased by dexamethasone and following catecholamine depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and reserpine. Nine days after adrenal demedullation blood E levels collected at decapitation were less than 7% of levels found in sham operated controls but artery homogenate E was unchanged. Demedullated rats given 6-OHDA followed by reserpine for 4 days also had unchanged arterial E levels despite arterial NE levels that were less than 15% of controls. We conclude that arteries synthesize E in vitro and appear to synthesize E in vivo using an extraneuronal N-methyltransferase. This enzyme differs from adrenal PNMT in substrate and inhibitor specificity and its activity is enhanced by catecholamine depletion and by glucocorticoid treatment.\r"

This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this presumptive angiotensin-aldosterone mediated fibrosis and its functional consequences could be favorably altered by an antihypertensive oral dose (50 mg/kg/day) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Three groups were studied: control; untreated RHT for 8 weeks; treated RHT, with captopril started 48 h before banding and continued for 8 weeks. Interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area (morphometry), the fibrillar nature of collagen (picrosirius polarization), and the end diastolic stress-strain relation of the intact left ventricle were examined in each group. In comparison to untreated animals with RHT, we found that captopril, begun prior to banding, attenuated interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and prevented hypertrophy and the rise in diastolic stiffness 8 weeks later. Thus, an adverse accumulation of collagen in the interstitium and around intramyocardial coronary arteries, and its functional consequences in the rat with RHT, can be prevented by captopril. Other ACE inhibitors may have similar salutary effects, but remain to be evaluated. The pathogenetic origin of myocardial fibrosis in RHT requires further investigation, but appears to be related to the angiotensin-aldosterone system.\r"

The isoelectric pattern of ovarian follicular fluid inactive renin was similar, with slight shifts at major peaks to a higher pH. Pregnancy plasma had inactive renin patterns like normal human plasma as did pleural fluid, lymphocoele fluid and plasma from anephric humans. Amniotic fluid inactive renin showed a markedly different pattern with major peaks at pH 5.00, 5.16 and 5.30. Fetal plasma (cord blood) also showed differences with only four peaks at 5.24, 5.40, 5.58 and 5.83. We conclude that human prorenin isoelectric patterns are similar for plasma, ovarian and most tissue fluid prorenins, but different for fetal plasma and amniotic fluid suggesting that these forms of renin do not cross the placental barrier.\r"

We measured alpha 2-adrenoceptor density and characteristics in a proximal tubule suspension with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 3H-rauwolscine. SHR had a significantly greater density of alpha 2-adrenoceptors when compared to their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (146 +/- 13 v 58 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein; P less than .001). Competition experiments determined the alpha 2-adrenoceptor to be an alpha 2B-subtype. Agonist competition curves were shallow and exhibited pseudo-Hill slopes of less than 1, indicating that they bind to both high and low affinity receptor sites. In summary, alpha 2-adrenoceptors are increased in the proximal tubule of SHR and appear to be of the alpha 2B-subtype. An increase in alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be related to abnormalities in hypertension.\r"

A seven week treatment of DOCA and salt resulted in a significant increase in the systolic blood pressure of the uninephrectomized rats. The administration of propranolol (40 mg/L and 80 mg/L in drinking water) had little effect on the development of hypertension. After a three week administration of propranolol, perfused mesenteric vasculatures were prepared in vitro, and endogenous norepinephrine release as well as vascular responsiveness were examined. Endogenous norepinephrine and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were greater in the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats than in the normotensive rats. In the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats treated with propranolol, the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release and pressor responses were significantly attenuated, at both doses, compared with the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. These results demonstrate that propranolol inhibited the vascular sympathetic nerve activity in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. This occurrence suggests a possible role of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of sympathetic tone in DOCA-salt hypertension.\r"

Rats fed either a 0.3% of 4% NaCl diet from 3 weeks of age were killed at 13 to 15 weeks of age. The renal papilla was sectioned and incubated in Krebs-Henseleit buffer. We stimulated PGE biosynthesis by incubation of tissues in hyperosmolal buffer (1500 mOsm NaCl) or in the presence of furosemide (3 mmol/L). PGE production was determined by radioimmunoassay of the incubation buffer. The PGE biosynthesis in response to hyperosmolality was significantly greater in the groups fed the 4% NaCl diet, independent of rat strain. The PGE biosynthesis in response to furosemide was significantly greater in each group of DR rats, independent of dietary NaCl. These results suggest that in the renal papilla of the Dahl rat stimulation-secretion coupled PGE biosynthesis is dependent not only on genetic determinants but also on the type of stimulus applied.\r"

  ".W": "There is a growing awareness that the direct intrarenal actions of angiotensin II (ANG II) on both tubular and vascular structures contribute to sodium conservation. Even very low concentrations of ANG II (10(-1)) mol/L) stimulate proximal reabsorption rate. Recent studies indicate that this stimulatory action is due to an enhanced activity of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger of the luminal membrane. Elevated ANG II levels in the renal interstitium, effected either through increased delivery of ANG II via the circulation or as a consequence of conversion of angiotensin I (ANG I) generated locally, can also enhance proximal reabsorption rate. One consequence of enhanced proximal reabsorption rate is reduced distal volume delivery, which would be expected to elicit arteriolar vasodilation mediated by the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism. It has been observed, however, that peritubular capillary infusions of either ANG I or ANG II, at doses sufficiently low to be without obvious direct effects on glomerular dynamics, can increase the sensitivity of the TGF mechanism. This enhanced TGF sensitivity serves to minimize or prevent TGF mediated increases in glomerular filtration rate in the face of reduced distal delivery. With greater increases in interstitial ANG II concentration, reductions in glomerular pressure have been observed, demonstrating a powerful action on preglomerular arterioles that predominates over the well known effects on efferent arterioles. At these higher doses, the direct hemodynamic actions of ANG II, plus the effects on the glomerular filtration coefficient, will directly reduce filtered sodium load. Through these synergistic effects on both tubular reabsorptive and hemodynamic function, ANG II can elicit sustained decreases in distal nephron sodium delivery which contribute greatly to its efficacy as a regulator of sodium excretion.\r"

The physical basis of the compliance concept and experimental procedures in animals both indicate that the relation between arterial compliance and blood pressure pattern is often unclear. Compliance is pressure-dependent because of the biphasic elastin and collagen composition of arteries and, hence, decreases when blood pressure increases. Compliance also determines the pulsatile amplitude of the pressure wave by regulating the buffering function of an artery's face to the cardiac pump and, accordingly, its reduction induces a selective increase in systolic level. The questions are whether these theoretical and experimental phenomena can be extrapolated to human hypertension and whether they can be assessed from indirect measurement of arterial compliance by means of a time-domain analysis of arterial pressure and flow waves via various models of the arterial tree. Whatever the method and site of measurement, arterial compliance was found to be decreased in different forms of hypertension. This low compliance can be considered to have a causal role in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In contrast, in patients with systolo-diastolic hypertension physiologic and pharmacologic arguments exist against the fact that low arterial compliance may be the pure consequence of mean blood pressure elevation. Moreover, it is suggested that aging acts in concurrence with pressure elevation to decrease arterial compliance, and that in certain hypertensive patients additional factors, perhaps atherosclerotic in nature, contribute to impair the elastic properties of arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The histologic response to this cement was evaluated by implanting disks made of this material within the heads of nine cats. Three sets of 12 hydroxyapatite cement disks were produced containing 0%, 10%, and 20% macropores by volume, respectively. The disks were implanted subcutaneously, intramuscularly, above the periosteum of the skull, and directly onto the surface of the calvarium. Each macropore percentage was represented in each tissue plane, and animals were killed up to 9 months postoperatively. There were no toxic reactions, implants extruded, or wound infections. Histologic examination of the implant-soft-tissue interfaces revealed a transient inflammatory response without foreign body reaction. The disks were resorbed over time in direct proportion to their macropore content (surface areas) in all groups except for those disks placed directly onto the surface of the calvarium below the periosteum. In this group, numerous foci of bone formed at the skull-implant interface, with variable replacement of the deep surface of these implants by bone. Implant replacement by bone is postulated to occur through a combination of implant resorption coupled with osteoconduction. Based on these properties, hydroxyapatite cement may prove useful when applied to the reconstruction of non-stress-bearing skeletal tissue.\r"

Hydroxyapatite cement, which can be shaped intraoperatively and sets to a microporous hydroxyapatite implant, was applied to this problem. Nine cats had the anterior table of their frontal sinus unilaterally removed and the sinus cavity stripped of its mucosa. Hydroxyapatite cement was used to obliterate the cavity and reconstruct the overlying anterior table defect. The unoperated side served as the control, and the animals were sacrificed up to 18 months postoperatively. There were no adverse reactions, infections, mucoceles, or implant extrusions. The normal anatomic contour of the forehead region overlying the hydroxyapatite cement implants was maintained in all animals. Histologic examination of undecalcified whole sinus sections revealed progressive replacement of the implants with woven bone without a loss of volume. Replacement of the hydroxyapatite cement by woven bone is postulated to occur through a combination of implant resorption coupled with osteoconduction. The use of hydroxyapatite cement proved successful for the reconstruction and obliteration of cat frontal sinuses, and may be appropriate for the same application in humans.\r"

Four-centimeter segmental defects of the midbody of the edentulous mandible were reconstructed in 36 dogs, with specimens recovered at 3 and 6 months and quantitatively compared for total and new bone by histomorphometric analysis. Autogenous grafts consisted of corticocancellous cranial block (CB), corticocancellous iliac block (IB), and particulate cancellous iliac marrow (PM). The allogeneic bone was demineralized and freeze-dried, and consisted of particulate cortical endochondral bone (FP), cranial cortical block (FCB), and iliac cortical block (FIB). Clinically and histomorphometrically, results appeared to indicate that (1) CB compared favorably with IB at 3 and 6 months for total bone, but IB showed a trend for more new bone formation at 6 months, a trend that may be due to the thicker cortical component of CB, which requires longer time periods to remodel than the cancellous rich IB; (2) FP failed to achieve bony union at 3 months, with inadequate rates of new bone formation; and (3) FCB and FIB compared favorably for total bone with CB and IB at 6 months, although new bone for autogenous CB and IB was 26.9% and 45.4%, while new bone for allogeneic FCB and FIB represented only 7.9% and 17.4%.\r"

Follow-up ranged from 15 to 192 months, with a median of 66 months. Absolute 5-year survival was 62% (13/21). Five of 17 patients treated initially with surgery alone achieved local control and long-term survival. All five had low-grade lesions. Five patients received postoperative radiation therapy because of positive surgical margins. Three were rendered disease free, and all had low-grade lesions. Radiation therapy was used as primary treatment in six patients, four of whom received additional chemotherapy. Of these six, two are disease free with longer than 5-year follow-up. Surgery with and without adjuvant therapy successfully salvaged 42% (5/12) of the patients with local recurrence. Eighty percent (12/15) of the patients with low-grade lesions were ultimately rendered disease free vs only 8% (1/12) of the patients with high-grade histologic features. Seventy-two percent (13/18) of the patients with local recurrence were known to have positive surgical margins. Sixty-eight percent (13/19) of the patients with recurrent disease had high-grade lesions and/or tumor size larger than 5 cm. Tumor grade is the most important prognostic factor followed by tumor size and surgical margin status. Patients with low-grade lesions and adequate surgical margins are treated well with surgery alone. Patients with high-grade lesions or positive surgical margins should receive adjuvant treatment.\r"

Although the sensitivity of imaging techniques for detection of neck nodes is gradually improving, the specificity for metastases remains low. Cytologic examination could, theoretically, supply additive information. Computed tomographic-and magnetic resonance-guided aspiration techniques have been described, but these were not efficacious and laborious. In 1984, we developed a technique for ultrasound-guided (UG) fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). This technique is described herein, and the value of UGFNAB is compared with conventional FNAB. All statistical characteristics of UGFNAB appeared to be superior to conventional FNAB (sensitivity, 98% vs 88%; specificity, 95% vs 82%; positive predictive value, 98% vs 93%; negative predictive value, 95% vs 74%; and accuracy, 97% vs 87%). Furthermore, UGFNAB was characterized by less nondiagnostic aspirations. It is concluded that UGFNAB is a reliable technique for differentiation between benign nodes and cervical lymph node metastases and it may, therefore, contribute to a more accurate assessment of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\r"

No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of major complications. All patients who required a second operation to remove the remaining hemithyroid after the final pathology reports were reviewed elected local anesthesia for their second procedure, attesting to patient satisfaction. Some hemithyroidectomies performed using local anesthesia were outpatient procedures.

Besides its aesthetic ramifications, marked inferior displacement of the nasal tip adversely affects nasal function by restricting airflow through the nares. We present a new technique that is a modification of a lateral crural flap procedure that was described in 1975. This technique, which is performed using an open rhinoplasty approach, predictably rotates the nasal tip upward by restructuring the alar cartilages via controlled overlay of the lateral crura. When overprojection accompanies tip ptosis, the controlled lateral crural overlay technique permits graduated retrodisplacement of the tip, in addition to rotation, giving the surgeon full control for reliably and accurately repositioning the nasal tip superiorly and posteriorly.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical analysis of middle ear effusions provides indirect evidence of epithelial function, but no direct studies of middle ear epithelial function have been published. This study uses cell culture techniques to study the bioelectric properties of these cells and their response to pharmacologic agents. Middle ear epithelial cells were isolated by protease and DNase digestion and cultured on collagen matrices. A transepithelial potential difference (PD) measured by calomel half cells peaked by day 8 in culture (PD = -8.6 +/- 1.6 mV). Resistance and short-circuit current (ISC) were calculated to be 307 +/- 46 omega/cm2 and 28 +/- 4.1 A/cm2, respectively. At peak PD, cultures were mounted in flux chambers (Ussing), and pharmacologic agents were applied. Amiloride (10(-4) mol/L), an inhibitor of Na transport, decreased ISC by 52.3% +/- 4.9% but had no effect when added basolaterally. Carbachol (10(-4) mol/L), a cholinergic agonist, had no effect when added to the apical bath but increased ISC by 62.9% +/- 12.4% when added basolaterally. Isoproterenol (10(-4) mol/L), a beta-adrenergic agonist, increased ISC by 4.8% +/- 1.8% when added apically but had no effect when added basally. These results indicate that the epithelium lining the middle ear plays a role in regulating the quantity and composition of liquid in the middle ear by ion transport and that cell culture may be useful in studying this phenomenon.\r"

Whereas virus was readily recovered from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 of 10 nonvaccinated controls following this challenge dose, virus was not recovered from the three animals that received the vaccine with MDP nor from one of two animals that received the vaccine with IFA and one of three animals that received the aqueous vaccine. The animals that were protected against challenge were those that had detectable SIV antibody response to the envelop, both the outer glycoprotein (gp120) and the truncated transmembrane glycoprotein (gp31). Protected monkeys tended to have higher titers of syncytial inhibition antibody prior to challenge. An anamnestic response after challenge was observed only in the vaccinated monkeys that became infected. Vaccinated animals that became challenge-infected tended to live longer than infected controls. These results confirm those at two other primate centers and indicate that killed whole SIV vaccines can protect against low challenge doses of SIV and prevent early death in those monkeys that do become infected. The mechanism of this protection remains undetermined. This finding adds optimism to the possibility of an eventual AIDS vaccine.\r"

This assay, which used purified rgp160 as antigen, was compared with the Biotech/Du Pont HIV-1 Western blot and the Abbott HIV-1 EIA. Of 33 volunteers who received three doses of rgp160 vaccine, seroresponses were detected in 91% by rgp160 EIA, 97% by Western blot, and 30% by HIV-1 EIA. The level of IgG rgp160 EIA antibody (mainly IgG1) peaked after the third immunization; 64% of 33 vaccinees still had detectable antibody by 12 months. The fourth immunization induced anamnestic IgG EIA antibody in 23 of 24 vaccinees, with titers ranging from 1:200 to 1:25,600. Neutralizing antibody was not detected in postvaccination sera by microtiter syncytium formation inhibition assay. Additional testing of sera by EIA indicated that the immune response to the vaccine was directed toward epitopes on both gp120 and gp41. Seroresponses to the immunodominant epitopes on gp41 were infrequent and none were detected to the neutralization epitope in the V3 region of gp120. This highly sensitive EIA is useful for characterizing HIV-1-specific antibody responses induced by an HIV-1 gp160 subunit vaccine.\r"

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat there are seven cysteines located between residues 22 and 37 that are thought to form a metal-nucleic acid-binding structure. Most of the previous mutagenesis studies had demonstrated that these residues are essential for tat activity and virus expression. Here we show that potentially conserved cysteine-histidine substitutions within the proposed tetrahedral structure still eliminate tat activity and virus expression. Consistent with previous studies, one cysteine-to-histidine mutation (amino acid 31) had little effect on trans-activation. We have studied the functional properties, stability and subcellular localization of several tat protein mutants. Most of the mutants are stable and properly localized to the nucleus and/or nucleolus. However, cysteine-to-glycine at position 34 affected tat stability. Our studies with the histidine mutants suggest that tat does not assume the prototype \"zinc finger\" structure for metal binding.\r"

These autoantibodies do not bind to cellular CD4, but react with sCD4 to increase its binding in ELISA to monoclonal antibodies and the HIV surface glycoprotein gp120. The effect of CD4 autoantibodies is mimicked by monoclonal antibodies to the third and fourth domains of CD4. The enhanced sCD4 binding to gp120 in ELISA is reflected by a reduction in the concentration of sCD4 required to neutralize HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in tissue culture when CD4 autoantibodies or the relevant monoclonal antibodies were present.\r"

Upon cocultivation of HL2/3 and HLCD4-CAT cells, efficient cell fusion is observed within 8 h. The efficiency of fusion can be evaluated visually and quantitated by measuring CAT enzyme. This novel bioassay allows testing for drugs capable of interfering with the CD4-Env interaction. HL2/3 cell line secretes gp120env in the medium and can be used for the production of Env protein.\r"

To study the effects of potential fusion inhibitors, a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing the envelope glycoprotein was generated and used to infect HeLa CD4+ cells. Syncytium induction was observed as early as 4 h postinfection and continued until the entire monolayer was fused. The N-terminus of the gp41 subunit of the HIV envelope protein is very hydrophobic, and appears to be involved in virus-induced membrane fusion. We synthesized several oligopeptide analogs of the N-terminal region of gp41 and determined their ability to inhibit HIV-induced cell fusion in CD4+ HeLa cells. A hexapeptide which was identical in amino acid sequence to the N-terminus of gp41 was found to completely inhibit cell fusion, whereas peptides with altered sequences showed reduced inhibitory activity. These peptides had no effect on protein synthesis, processing, or transport to the cell surface, and showed no signs of toxicity to cells even at very high concentrations. These results indicate that oligopeptides which are homologous to the fusion peptide of HIV inhibit virus-induced cytopathology, and should be evaluated further as potential antiviral agents.\r"

Of most significance, mutations in Tax that affect transactivation of the IL-2R alpha regulatory sequences, but retain their ability to activate the viral long terminal repeat also fail to yield the aggregation phenotype. Based on these findings, expression of Tax in yeast may prove to be a simple primordial system for examining the regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions involved in regulation of gene expression.\r"

This is consistent with what has been found with other retroviruses. In the search for a method allowing the copurification of the gp120 with the virion we have applied two-phase extraction based on water-soluble polymers. Several polymer systems were tested for their capacity to enrich HIV-1 from HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cell culture medium. With a dextran-polyethylene glycol system the gp120 and the gag protein p24, used as marker of the virion, were recovered to about 60 and 70%, respectively, in 1% of the initial volume. The two proteins were both about 30-fold purified and reverse transcriptase activity and infectious titer were retained to a high degree. The calculated molar ratio of gp120 to p24 was twofold higher in the phase-extracted fraction than in material pelleted by ultracentrifugation. It is concluded that extraction in aqueous two-phase systems is a method well suited for the concentration and initial purification of HIV-1. The technique is adaptable to almost any scale and may replace ultracentrifugation. Qualitatively, its main advantage over the latter method is the enhanced recovery of the gp120 in the virion fraction.\r"

  ".W": "An important aspect of the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type 1 is its clinical latency, suggesting that the virus itself or the provirus may remain latent for extended periods of time after primary infection. Certain heterologous viral proteins or chemical and physical agents are able to reactivate latent virus. Since a common denominator shared by these agents is the ability to cause stress response in cells, we have examined the effects of oxidative stress mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on HIV-1 latently infected promonocytic cell line termed U1. After exposure to H2O2 in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 mM, the viability of the U1 cells decreased during 24 h before recovery. At 24 h post stress, the U1 cells began to express virus as assessed by elevated reverse transcriptase activities in culture supernatants. Immunofluorescence carried out on stressed U1 cells using anti-HIV-1 polyclonal antibodies showed that H2O2 leads to HIV-1 gene expression activation, but not to a release of viral particles from damaged cells. Additionally, using a HeLa cell line containing integrated the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we have shown that oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 allows transactivation of the viral LTR revealed by intracellular CAT activity. A stimulation factor of around 4 of CAT activity can be reached when these cells are treated with 0.5 mM H2O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sequences encoding the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase gene have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein is a lambda cII fusion protein of 37 kD containing the carboxyl-terminal 27 amino acids of reverse transcriptase fused to the entire integrase sequence and is insoluble, a feature which allows partial purification away from soluble bacterial proteins. As judged by its reactivity with HIV positive sera in Western blot and in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the recombinant integrase retains antigenicity similar to native protein. Additionally, ELISA data obtained with the cloned protein indicate that patients infected with HIV-1 who are at different stages of progression to AIDS have antibodies reactive with the cloned integrase. HIV-2 positive human sera are also reactive with the cloned integrase. Rabbit antibodies produced against the recombinant protein react both by ELISA and Western blot with the homologous bacterially expressed protein, recognize both virion HIV-1 integrase and reverse transcriptase in Western blots, and immunoprecipitate an HIV-1 virion protein of 34 kD. Unlike human antisera from patients infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2 which are frequently reactive with both HIV-1 and HIV-2 integrase, the rabbit antibodies are type specific, reacting with HIV-1, but not with HIV-2 integrase by Western blot.\r"

Most of the anti-HIV-1 drugs reported thus far, such as azidothymidine (AZT), inhibit acute HIV-1 infection but have no antiviral effect against persistent infection. We report here that oxophenarsine (3-amino-4 hydroxyphenylarsineoxide hydrochloride), an antisyphilus drug inhibits HIV-1 production in acutely infected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and persistently infected T cells. In acutely infected PBL and H9 T cells, the drug is effective at concentrations as low as 0.07-0.15 micrograms/ml with no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations of 6.0 micrograms/ml or below. It does not inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at doses up to 60 micrograms/ml. The drug has no effect on HIV-1-specific DNA and RNA synthesis. However, it inhibits HIV-1 protein synthesis in both acutely and persistently infected cells.\r"

Incubation of HIV-1 with human saliva followed by addition of the mixture to susceptible cells leads to partial or complete suppression of viral replication in vitro. We investigated the inhibitory effects of whole saliva and specific glandular salivas on HIV-1 infectivity as measured by viral-induced cytopathic effects in susceptible cells. Whole saliva contained marked inhibitory activity to HIV-1, strain HTLV-IIIB, and to virus infected cells. Submandibular saliva contained inhibitory activity, but of lesser quantity. Parotid saliva demonstrated no HIV-inhibitory activity. Whole saliva also appeared to contain filterable components that were inhibitory to lymphocyte growth. Passage through a .45 micron pore-size filter eliminated the viral inhibitory activity of submandibular saliva and some of the activity in whole saliva. All salivas except parotid incubated with HIV-1 followed by filtration were inhibitory suggesting that complexing of virus with high molecular weight, submandibular mucins may play a role in viral inhibition.\r"

The infectivity of cell-free virus was gradually inactivated and at pH 5.4 was completely lost, with or without subsequent adjustment of pH to neutral. Virus-producing cells also gradually lost their ability to infect as the pH decreased; however, restoration of neutral pH resulted in regained infectivity. Since the pH values used in the study are similar to those found at various entry sites of the human body, the data may be relevant to the mode of transmittal of HIV.\r"

Patients with high HIV-Ag-CIC had a more severe clinical course and 90% of those with markedly elevated HIV-Ag-CIC (greater than 3+) have died within 6 to 24 months. HIV-Ag-CIC were also present in some patients including neonates and young infants in whom free HIV-Ag was undetectable. Monitoring of HIV-Ag in isolated CIC may be of value for early detection of HIV infection and for monitoring of disease outcome.\r"

Our results indicate that: (1) antibodies against platelet proteins were found in 8 of 123 (6.5%) nonthrombocytopenic patients, as compared with 17 of 85 (20%) of thrombocytopenic patients (p less than 0.03); (2) these antibodies appeared to be more frequently found in advanced stages of disease (p less than 0.02); (3) the reactivity of positive sera with antigenic determinants implicated several distinct platelet proteins; (4) antigens thus recognized are unrelated to the major membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa, as well as absent in vero cells and trypsin-sensitive cells. Such results underscore the difficulties in establishing the mechanisms involved in platelet destruction during HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "In a cross-sectional study of 926 subjects from 10 drug treatment programs conducted in 1984 in New Jersey, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 35% overall; 30% in whites, 33% in hispanics, and 46% in blacks (p = 0.01 for comparison of blacks to non-blacks). Univariate analysis showed the seroprevalence of HIV was not associated with age or gender, but did correlate with frequency of cocaine or heroin injection (p trend less than 0.001); frequency of needle sharing (p trend = 0.007); and inversely with levels of education (p = 0.05). The prevalence of HIV was also inversely related to the distance of the treatment center from lower Manhattan; being highest for distances of less than 5 miles from lower Manhattan and lowest for distances of 80 miles, with intermediate rates for the intervening distances (p trend less than 0.001). In multivariate analyses, HIV seropositivity was consistently associated with the frequency of needle sharing (p = 0.02) and less than 12 years (high school level) of education (p = 0.02), but not with black race. However, blacks who shared needles less than once a month had a relative risk of 3.2 (95% CI 1.2, 7.7) while non-blacks who shared less than once a month had a relative risk of only 0.9 (95% CI 0.3, 2.4). The risk in non-blacks increased to more than twofold with more frequent needle sharing. When the analysis was stratified by gender and adjusted for needle sharing and geography, a significant twofold increased risk was observed for female (but not male) subjects who had two or more heterosexual partners compared with those who had one partner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several problems are described: inadequate or unskilled communication of information, withdrawal by the physician, patient labelling and poor health care. Palliative care must be based on a philosophy that acknowledges the inherent worth and dignity of each person. In addition, it must take place within the framework of four ethical principles: autonomy, beneficience, nonmaleficience and justice. The first and most important of these is the need to regard patients as unique people with a right to compassion, gentle truth, autonomy in decision-making and excellence in physicial and psychospiritual care. Beneficence obliges us not only to relieve suffering but also to enhance the patient's quality of life whenever possible. Nonmaleficence and justice require allocation of sufficient health care resources of the type necessary to provide high-quality care and prevent patients from coming to harm.\r"

DATA SYNTHESIS: The noise levels from low-level flights could affect hearing acuity. However, the more important consequences appear to be stress-mediated physiologic effects, especially cardiovascular ones, and psychologic distress, particularly in children. Subjective perception of control over the noise has been found to mitigate some physiologic effects.

SETTING: Residents living 150 m or less (high-exposure area), 151 to 400 m (intermediate-exposure area) or 401 to 800 m (low-exposure area) southeast from the plant. PARTICIPANTS: All children aged 10 years or less and all pregnant women living in the designated area. OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlation of venous blood lead levels with soil lead concentrations in the areas in which the subjects lived and with sociodemographic and behavioural factors. MAIN RESULTS: Of the estimated 57 pregnant women 38 (67%) participated: 20 were in the high-exposure area and 18 in the other two areas; their geometric mean blood lead levels were low (0.15 and 0.13 mumol/L respectively). Of the 625 eligible children 510 (82%) participated: 169 were in the high-exposure area, 179 in the intermediate-exposure area and 162 in the low-exposure area; their geometric mean lead levels were 0.43, 0.30 and 0.26 mumol/L respectively. Within each age group children in the high-exposure area had the highest levels. The mean levels for children aged 6 months to 5 years were 0.49, 0.35 and 0.28 mumol/L in the three areas respectively. Within each exposure group children aged 1 to 2 years had the highest levels. No potential confounding variables could explain the relation between blood lead level and soil lead concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnant women's blood lead levels did not seem to be affected by exposure level, but the children's levels were primarily related to the soil lead concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous study has shown that interleukin 6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (mesPGN). To investigate whether urinary IL-6 can be used as an indicator in the prognosis of patients with IgA nephropathy, we monitored IL-6 activity in the urine of patients with IgA nephropathy for 10 months and compared IL-6 activity with clinical data as well as the histological changes of the kidneys obtained from the patients. It was found that among the patients who had continuously high urinary IL-6 activity, histological progression of IgA nephropathy was observed. On the other hand, among the patients whose urinary IL-6 became undetectable during the 10-month follow-up, histological improvement of IgA nephropathy was observed. These data suggest that the measurement of urinary IL-6 is a helpful tool for monitoring the progression of IgA nephropathy.\r"

From 1982 the rate of referral increased, the prodromal illness more often consisted of bloody diarrhea, and the mean age at presentation doubled from 2 to 4 years. For patients with a good outcome there was an excess of males in the period 1970-81, and females in the period 1982-87. Moreover, in the years 1982-87 the disorder was distinguished from that of the earlier time by a positive correlation between adverse outcome and both neutrophil leukocytosis and a higher hemoglobin concentration at presentation. Prognostic scores obtained by logistic regression analysis were specific for each period. From July 1983 stool samples were analyzed for verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) and neutralizable verotoxin. Positive results were obtained in 39% of cases. The nature of HUS has changed and the new form of the disorder is associated with VTEC infection.\r"

We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a \"peritonitis-like syndrome\" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction.\r"

  ".W": "A bolus dose of heparin was administered pre-dialysis to patients (n = 6) undergoing regular maintenance hemodialysis with cuprophane flat plate and hollow fiber membranes. Blood samples were withdrawn at hourly internals for measurement of a) heparin and b) activation markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelets. Two assay methods for heparin were employed; amidolytic assay of anti-factor Xa activity in plasma and a simple whole blood clotting time based upon factor Xa inhibition (Heptest). Results from these heparin assays correlated well with each other (r = 0.89) and both showed similar negative correlations (r = -0.72, amidolytic and r = -0.66, Heptest) with levels of a marker of fibrin clot formation, fibrinopeptide A (FPA). Large differences in levels of FPA were observed during dialysis with the two dialyzer types, when similar levels of heparin were present. Heparin levels declined from 1-5-h dialysis and were associated with rises in plasma levels of FPA, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and beta thromboglobulin (BTG), but not of D-dimer. Regression analysis revealed the best correlation was between FPA and TAT (r = 0.94), followed by FPA and BTG (r = 0.81). FPA and D-dimer exhibited significant, but lower (r = 0.42), correlation. TAT levels, like FPA levels, showed good correlation with heparin (r greater than 0.65). It is concluded that the Heptest assay may be a useful bedside measurement of heparin levels and the TAT assay may be a simplified means of evaluating coagulation system activation during dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the hemodynamic effects of the correction of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in 28 hemodialysis patients with severe anemia. Echocardiograms were recorded before the administration of rHuEPO (period I) with a hematocrit of 19.2 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SD) and repeated twice (periods II and III) when the hematocrit was increased to 25.7 +/- 1.1% and to 30.0 +/- 1.0%. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) decreased from 51.0 +/- 6.1 to 48.8 +/- 5.8 and to 48.3 +/- 7.1 mm, but no changes were observed in left ventricular end-systolic dimension. Cardiac output (CO) decreased from 5.89 +/- 1.46 to 5.00 +/- 1.44 and to 4.67 +/- 1.33 l/min. The thickness of the interventricular septum and the left ventricular posterior wall remained unchanged. Blood pressure was kept rather constant, although antihypertensive therapy needed to be adjusted to prevent the occurrence or aggravation of hypertension. Total peripheral resistance increased from 1481 +/- 359 to 1832 +/- 487 and to 1946 +/- 493 dynes.sec/cm5. The decreases in LVDd and CO were significant between periods I and II, without further changes between periods II and III. More antihypertensive therapy was needed in period III than in period II. Similar echocardiographic results were observed in 10 patients in whom antihypertensive therapy was not required throughout the study. In conclusion, an increase in hematocrit to 25% would be appropriate in order to obtain an effective hemodynamic improvement with rHuEPO therapy in dialysis patients although a higher hematocrit level might be desirable in order to improve working capacity.\r"

When professionals agreed with the parents and attended to their concerns, confirmation of the hearing loss occurred significantly more rapidly than when they disagreed with parents and ignored their concerns. A child whose hearing loss is not clearly identified and whose communication is inadequate or nonexistent, causes frustration and stress within the family and prevents the child from receiving the maximum benefit from early language input and amplification. It would benefit both the child and family if professionals would listen to parental concerns regarding their child and assist in the early identification process.\r"

The group totaled 274 children (163 boys; 111 girls) whose ages ranged from 2 weeks to 17 years. Characteristics were IQ/DQ, 30 to 70 in the 115 for whom scores were available; 41% had seizures; 15% had sensorineural hearing loss; 54% showed gross motor delay or ataxia; and 27% had decreased muscle tone. One patient with a classical clinical picture of biotinidase deficiency was diagnosed during the study period and was not included in the study. None of the patients with nonclassic findings had a deficiency of biotinidase activity. Our results suggest that biotinidase deficiency does not account for a large proportion of children with unexplained neurologic abnormalities or developmental delay. This does not negate the importance of biotinidase testing in children with clinical patterns specifically suggestive of the deficiency.\r"

The catheter has a unique pigtail confirguration at the distal end, intended to simplify placement and minimize chest wall and lung trauma by reduced tube size and depth and insertion. Thirty-eight JCTs were placed in neonates with pneumothoraces. Neonates' birth weights ranged from 400 to 3,595 grams. All 38 tubes immediately relieved clinical signs of pneumothoraces. Thirty-five (92%) tubes immediately fully evacuated the pneumothoraces as evidences on chest radiograph. Twelve pneumothoraces partially reoccurred at a mean of 24 hours following JCT placement. These tubes were either irrigated or replaced. This newly configured chest tube functions effectively in the treatment of neonatal pneumothorax.\r"

The mean duration of symptoms was approximately six months (range 1-14 months). None had been previously diagnosed as having sinusitis or received appropriate treatment. Although all were referred for evaluation of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, approximately 1/3 were found to have neither of these conditions. Among patients who had asthma, their asthmatic symptoms were aggravated by the sinusitis. All patients eventually responded favorably to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Earlier diagnosis and appropriate therapy would have foreshortened the course of this very discomforting condition. In recent years, we have observed a marked increase in the number of patients referred with the chief complaint of \"worsening allergy\" and who were subsequently found to have sinusitis. Most of the patients experienced significant incapacitation for protracted periods before a correct diagnosis was made and treatment instituted. In all but a few cases, prompt and sustained improvement followed appropriate therapy. The purpose of this report is to present a retrospective review of 34 illustrative cases.\r"

The subjects received a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine, and blood samples were collected during 48 hours. Concentrations of thioridazine and metabolites in serum were measured by HPLC. Slow hydroxylators of debrisoquin obtained higher serum levels of thioridazine with a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold larger AUC(0-infinity) associated with a twofold longer half-life compared with that of rapid hydroxylators. The side-chain sulphoxide (mesoridazine) and sulphone (sulphoridazine), which are active metabolites, appeared more slowly in serum and had lower Cmax values, but comparable AUC. The thioridazine ring-sulphoxide attained higher Cmax and 3.3-fold higher AUC in slow hydroxylators than in rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin. Thus the formation of mesoridazine from thioridazine and the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquin seem to be catalyzed by the same enzyme, whereas the formation of thioridazine ring-sulphoxide is probably formed mainly by another enzyme.\r"

Total serum clearance (113 +/- 49 ml/min), volume of distribution (11.9 +/- 4.5 L), and elimination half-life (166 +/- 149 minutes) were similar to those reported previously in both healthy control subjects and patients with cirrhosis. Bioavailability of 58% +/- 17% (range, 37% to 82%) was comparable to that of previous studies, and there was no difference between patients with mild and those with severe cirrhosis. In 9 of 12 patients the mean absorption time was longer than the mean residence time determined after intravenous administration (mean for all patients, 203 +/- 86 versus 134 +/- 101 minutes; p less than 0.05), indicating that furosemide followed a \"flip-flop\" model in these patients. In all patients the mean absorption time was prolonged relative to normal subjects irrespective of the presence of edema. As such, the slower absorption of furosemide in edematous states, such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, does not appear to be a consequence of edema per se. Moreover, because similar changes occur in patients with congestive heart failure, it seems that diseases with diverse pathophysiology can slow furosemide absorption.\r"

With caffeine administration theophylline steady-state concentration and area under the curve increased by 23% and 40%, respectively, whereas the volume of distribution at steady state seemed unchanged. The cumulative urinary excretion of 1-methyluric acid and 1-methylxanthine did not reach a plateau, suggesting a capacity-limiting factor in their formation. Notwithstanding the mutual interference of theophylline and caffeine metabolism, the reduction in apparent total body clearance and elimination rate constant of theophylline by 29% and 31%, respectively, indicated a pronounced influence of concomitant administration of realistic amounts of caffeine.\r"

The biliary clearance of digoxin was determined by a duodenal perfusion technique. Verapamil induced a 44% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of digoxin, from 0.80 +/- 0.24 to 1.15 +/- 0.40 nmol/L (p less than 0.01). The biliary clearance of digoxin decreased by 43%, from 187 +/- 89 to 101 +/- 55 ml/min (p less than 0.05), in the presence of verapamil, whereas the renal clearance was unaffected (153 +/- 31 versus 173 +/- 51 ml/min; difference not significant).

The renal elimination became increasingly important with hepatic impairment. Protein binding of cefpiramide was reduced significantly in the group with cirrhosis. The average unbound fraction was 10.4% +/- 9.5% in patients with cirrhosis and 1.9% +/- 0.3% in normal subjects (p less than 0.01).

Analysis of disposition kinetics in 10 healthy men revealed a multiexponential decline after the end of an infusion, with an elimination half-life averaging 203 minutes. This half-life was longer than that previously reported, indicating the presence of a shallow elimination phase. Plasma clearance averaged 14.6 ml/min/kg. The average intake of nicotine per cigarette was 2.29 mg. A cigarette smoke-monitoring system that directly measured particulate matter in smoke was evaluated in these subjects. Total particulate matter, number of puffs on the cigarette, total puff volume, and time of puffing correlated with the intake of nicotine from smoking. The oral bioavailability of nicotine averaged 44%. This bioavailability is higher than expected based on the systemic clearance of nicotine and suggests that there may be significant extrahepatic metabolism of nicotine.\r"

Ten healthy volunteers were treated with each contraceptive for a period of 3 months in a crossover trial. Both contraceptives significantly reduced antipyrine clearance by 34.6% (gestodene) and 43.3% (desogestrel) by impairing the oxidative metabolism, particularly to the 4-hydroxy and 3-hydroxymethyl metabolites, with little difference between the two associations. In addition, with both a comparable highly significant rise of plasma triglyceride levels, apolipoproteins A-I and A-II and the high-density lipoprotein-3 subfraction was observed. Treatment with these new monophasic contraceptives may reduce the metabolism of concomitantly given drugs undergoing oxidative transformations.\r"

To clarify whether this results from direct activation of the dopamine-1 receptor or indirectly from baroreflex sympathetic stimulation after blood pressure reduction, intraocular pressure was measured in 14 patients with accelerated/malignant hypertension, randomized between intravenous fenoldopam or sodium nitroprusside. Intraocular pressure was measured with a Perkins tonometer, before and at the twentieth minute of each dose increment. In seven patients with a mean blood pressure of 232/131 mm Hg treated with fenoldopam, intraocular pressure increased in a dose-dependent fashion, from 16 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). In contrast, seven patients with a mean blood pressure of 225/134 mm Hg treated with sodium nitroprusside exhibited no change in intraocular pressure (15 +/- 1 versus 14 +/- 1 mm Hg) despite similar blood pressure reduction. Increases in heart rate were not significantly different. Rates of urinary excretion of norepinephrine plus epinephrine increased significantly relative to baseline (p less than 0.05) but were not different between groups. These data suggest that the increase in intraocular pressure with fenoldopam results from specific activation of the dopamine-1 receptor and is not caused by baroreflex sympathetic stimulation. Because dopamine-1 receptors may modulate intraocular pressure, dopamine-1 receptor blockers might be useful therapy for glaucoma.\r"

Cardiovascular drug use in the week before onset of illness was compared between 270 patients hospitalized with agranulocytosis and 1870 hospitalized control subjects. Propranolol (relative risk, 2.5), dipyridamole (3.8), digoxin (2.5), and acetyldigoxin (9.9) were significantly associated with agranulocytosis. The excess risks attributable to these drugs ranged from one to three cases per 10 million persons exposed for up to 1 week. Increased risks were also observed for cinepazide (used by six cases and no control subjects), procainamide (7, 1), and aprindine (5, 1); based on crude relative risk estimates, the excess risks for the latter two drugs were approximately three per million persons exposed for up to 1 week. The use of cardiovascular drugs in a 5-month period ending 1 month before hospital admission was compared between 152 patients with aplastic anemia and 2180 control subjects. Furosemide was the only significantly associated drug (relative risk, 3.1); the excess risk attributable to any exposure in a 5-month interval was 1.7 per million.\r"

Advances in medical therapy and better understanding of unique pathophysiologic processes have afforded the colorectal surgeon the ability to treat better and sometimes cure the anorectal complications of AIDS. We present a series of 75 consecutive surgical procedures (1-year accrual) on HIV+ (40) and CDC AIDS (22) patients. Surgical procedures, perioperative T cell counts, and outcome will be presented; 53 percent of procedures resulted in complete healing of anal wounds; 30 percent resulted in partial healing with symptomatic relief; 17 percent resulted in symptomatic relief or tissue diagnosis without appreciable wound healing. The healing rate was significantly higher in the HIV+ group (69 percent) compared to the AIDS group (26 percent). Perioperative T cell counts did not have predictive value on outcome. No patients suffered significant unexpected morbidity, mortality, or incontinence. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of several disease processes unique to HIV+ patients and data from our ongoing investigation using RNA hybridization are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Both postanal repair and anterior sphincteroplasty with levatorplasty have been advocated in the treatment of idiopathic fecal incontinence. To assess the functional results of these procedures, physiologic and radiologic measurements were carried out prospectively in 33 patients with idiopathic incontinence undergoing operative treatment, and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Sixteen patients had anterior sphincteroplasty and levatorplasty and 17 had postanal repair. A satisfactory postoperative outcome was defined as perfect continence or incontinence of flatus only. Ten patients in the anterior sphincteroplasty group had satisfactory results (64 percent) and 10 in the postanal repair group (59 percent). Preoperatively, both groups had decreased resting and squeeze pressures, impaired and mucosal electrosensitivity, and marked pelvic descent vs. controls. Postoperatively, significant improvement in sphincter pressures and mucosal electrosensitivity was seen in both groups. No significant change in anorectal angle was demonstrated in the postanal repair group, whereas it was made significantly more obtuse in the anterior sphincteroplasty group. It is likely that the improved continence resulting from either of these two procedures is secondary to better anal sphincter muscle function and improved and sensation. It would appear that the anorectal angle is not crucial in maintaining continence.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with rectal prolapse or intussusception were studied to specifically focus on the effect of posterior rectopexy on fecal continence, anal pressure, and rectal capacity. Before operation, five patients were fully continent (A), 10 were continent for solid stools (B) and eight patients were fully incontinent (C). Group A remained fully continent; continence was regained nine times in group B and in group C, three patients regained full continence, two became continent for solid stools, three patients remained incontinent. Other symptoms such as constipation, false urgency, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation were not beneficially influenced by rectopexy. The patients' continence status was correlated to anorectal manometry and rectal capacity measurement. In group B, incremental pressure (P = squeeze - basal P) increased significantly (P less than 0.02) as well as incremental volume (V = maximum tolerated volume - volume of first sensation) (P less than 0.05). We conclude that, by an increase of incremental anal pressure and incremental rectal volume, posterior rectopexy offers an 83 percent chance of regaining full continence, or a major improvement, and a 17 percent chance of stabilization of fecal incontinence.\r"

A further comparison has been carried out between hand-sewn and stapled anastomosis; 147 patients have been followed for at least 2 years: 69 after APE and 78 after AR, 40 being stapled. The following variables potentially related to the risk of recurrence were evaluated: age, grading, staging, and site of the tumor. An overall 2-year local recurrence rate of 11 percent after APE and 12 percent after AR was observed, whereas it was 13 and 11 percent following stapled and hand-sewn sutures, respectively. Both differences were not statistically significant. A similar local recurrence rate was noted after APE and AR when the patients were matched for Dukes' stage and grading of the lesion. A trend toward an increased risk of recurrence following AR (P = 0.07) was shown when comparing the two procedures if mid and upper rectal cancers were grouped together. In the patients with anastomotic leaks after AR, no increase of local recurrence was observed. In conclusion, AR is unlikely to be followed by an increased risk of local recurrence and, therefore, when oncologically indicated, may be considered the operation of choice in the treatment of rectal cancer, although the possible risk of its overuse should be taken into account.\r"

Other variables evaluated included size and configuration of the polyp, grade of adenocarcinoma, presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion, and degree of differentiation. In patients with sessile polyps, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was 10 percent. Eighty percent of these lesions had lymphovascular invasion. For pedunculated polyps, the overall incidence of lymph node metastasis was 6 percent. However, there was no incidence of lymph node metastasis when the depth of invasion was limited to the head, neck, and stalk of the polyp (Levels 1, 2, and 3). Only when the depth of invasion reached to the base of the stalk (Level 4) was the risk of lymph node metastasis high (27 percent). The other risk factors were not associated with lymph node metastasis. We concluded that the most significant risk factor for lymph node metastasis in patients with invasive carcinoma in a polyp was invasion into the submucosa of the bowel wall (Level 4).\r"

  ".W": "Functional results after anterior rectal resections are commonly considered satisfactory but variable percentages of postoperative incontinence are often reported. Continence was evaluated after 20 low anterior resections (LAR) and 13 high anterior resections (HAR) by means of clinical assessment, anorectal manometry, and evacuation proctography. Whereas all HAR patients had perfect continence, 10 patients (50 percent of the LAR group had occasional episodes of soiling from liquid feces, 5 patients (25 percent had frequent soiling or occasional incontinence for solid feces, and 1 patient (5 percent had frequent solid stool loss requiring surgical treatment. Anal canal resting pressure at 3 and 4 cm from the anal verge was significantly lower in the LAR group (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05, respectively) than in the HAR group. However, the maximum voluntary contraction did not differ between the two groups. Rectoanal inhibitory reflex was found to be present in 17 of the 20 patients with LAR and in all patients with HAR. The volume at which the anal sphincter is continuously inhibited was significantly reduced in the LAR group (P less than 0.001). Also, the conscious rectal sensibility volumes were found to be significantly reduced for threshold, constant, and maximum tolerated volume. Threshold volume for internal sphincter relaxation was lower than the threshold volume for rectal sensation in some patients with LAR. This could allow postoperative fecal soiling. Rectal compliance was decreased (P less than 0.001) in the LAR group. Evacuation proctography, performed in six LAR patients affected by major soiling or solid stool loss, revealed an abnormal obtuse anorectal angle and pathologic lowering of the perineum at rest and during defecation. The concomitance of internal and sphincter impairment, reduction in rectal compliance, and previous pelvis floor muscle damage are postulated as cause affecting continence in patients who underwent LAR.\r"

Of the five AIDS patients, two died, one was transferred to a hospice facility, one was lost to follow-up, and one remains alive 1 year following treatment. The HIV-positive patient died secondary to metastatic SCCA. This group of patients raises the question of a possible association between HIV and SCCA.\r"

This confirmed the association between symptomatic diverticular disease and high intraluminal pressure. The patients of the subgroup--complicated diverticular disease--were relatively young (mean age: 51.1 +/- 2.02 years) and had a short history of abdominal pain (18-36 months) and a short segment of colon with diverticula (cm 7.25 +/- 1.31).

We review our experience, as well as the published data on 210 patients with ZES who have required omeprazole for control of gastric acid hypersecretion over the past seven years. The dose of omeprazole required in individual patients ranged from 10 to 180 mg/24 hr with 20-60% requiring a split dosage regimen. Omeprazole was effective in approximately 99% of the patients over a period ranging from 0.5 to 54 months. Twenty-four percent of patients required an increase in omeprazole dose, while 26% required a decrease in dose. Adverse effects attributable to omeprazole were reported in 2% of patients, and in all cases, they were mild (ie, rash, constipation, headache). There was no effect of omeprazole on serum gastrin concentration or on gastric endocrine cells in three studies. Although one patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type-I syndrome (MEN-I) in this series developed a gastric carcinoid while taking omeprazole, evidence is presented that suggests the presence of MEN-I per se may be important in determining the development of gastric carcinoid in patients with ZES. It is concluded that omeprazole is safe and effective in patients with ZES, and in these patients, it is the drug of choice for the management of gastric acid hypersecretion. However, yearly assessment is indicated to clearly evaluate the long-term risk of gastric carcinoid as well as therapy directed at the gastrinoma itself.\r"

Iron absorption studies were performed on rats on a normal diet (N = 42) and rats fed an iron-deficient diet (N = 43) for three weeks. Rats were orally dosed with 40 mumol/kg of omeprazole or placebo daily for two days prior to iron absorption studies. Rats were orally dosed with 1 mmol of ferrous chloride, ferric chloride or food iron (dietary suspension) containing 11 micrograms of iron and labeled with 1 microCi of 59Fe. Omeprazole-treated rats on the normal diet had no significant reduction in the absorption of ferric, ferrous, or food iron. In the rats on the iron-deficient diet, the absorption of ferrous iron decreased from 76 +/- 7.5% (mean +/- SE) in control rats to 38 +/- 8.5% in the omeprazole-treated rats (P less than 0.003) and the absorption of food iron decreased from 65 +/- 7.5% in control rats to 37 +/- 6.5% in the omeprazole-treated rats (P less than 0.016). There was no significant reduction in the absorption of ferric iron. Omeprazole therapy is unlikely to be associated with significant iron malabsorption in normal patients but may reduce iron absorption in pathological states associated with increased iron absorption such as iron deficiency.\r"

UDC also has been shown to be effective against refluxed bile-induced gastritis after gastric surgery. However the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of UDC on gastric mucosa has not been known. In the present study, cytoprotective actions of UDC and TUDC against chenodeoxycholate (CDC)-induced gastric injury were investigated using rabbit gastric cell cultures without systemic factors. Rabbit gastric mucosal cells were cultured after the isolation of rabbit gastric cells with collagenase and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Cytotoxicity was quantified by measuring 51Cr release from prelabeled cells and MTT assay. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Concentrations of CDC greater than 0.5 mM or UDC greater than 5 mM caused cellular damage and increased 51Cr release in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion, while TUDC up to 10 mM did not. TUDC, but not UDC, showed a significant decrease of CDC (1.5 mM)-induced 51Cr release dose dependently. The protective effect of TUDC against CDC-induced damage was confirmed by MTT assay. On phase-contrast microscopy, disruption of monolayers induced by CDC (1.5 mM) was clearly protected by TUDC (10 mM). Free radical scavengers (500 units/ml of superoxide dismutase, 300 units/ml of catalase, and 100 mM of dimethyl sulfoxide) or a calcium blocker (10(-7)-10(-5) M verapamil) did not show significant protection against CDC-induced damage. Deprivation of Ca2+ in the media did not affect CDC-induced damage. Thus free radicals or Ca2+ might not be involved in the cell toxicity of CDC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 37 children with H. pylori gastritis, group 1 comprised 23 patients with duodenal ulcer disease and group 2 had 14 patients without ulcers (primary H. pylori gastritis). Group 3 comprised four children with duodenal ulcer disease and H. pylori-negative antral biopsies. During the study period, all primary chronic ulcer disease was duodenal; no primary chronic gastric ulcer was present. Two distinct types of duodenal ulcer disease were identified; the majority (85%) was always associated with significant active H. pylori antral gastritis (group 1). The minority (15%) had virtually absent gastritis and no H. pylori (group 3). Native Indian children were represented in group 1 quite out of proportion to the referral population and had the most severe disease. While it is established that a higher prevalence of asymptomatic H. pylori infection exists in non-Caucasians, this appears to be the first demonstration of a higher prevalence of symptomatic ulcer disease in non-Caucasian children or adults. Caucasian children tended to have primary H. pylori gastritis (group 2) or duodenal ulcer without H. pylori (group 3). Antral nodularity was found to be an important specific endoscopic sign, unique to those children with H. pylori disease. It has not been described in adult H. pylori disease. Non-Caucasian children, especially Native Indians, in British Columbia have more prevalent and more severe H. pylori disease than Caucasians. Endoscopy with gastric antral biopsies is necessary to distinguish different types of duodenal ulcer disease and to diagnose primary H. pylori gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease is multifactorial and the contribution of Helicobacter pylori in relation to the other factors to the release of duodenal ulcer is unknown. To investigate this, we studied 147 patients with endoscopically proven healed ulcers. These patients were randomized to receive either placebo, misoprostol 200 micrograms or misoprostol 300 micrograms four times daily, and clinical, personal, physiological and endoscopic characteristics were obtained prospectively. Endoscopy was performed at the active phase of the ulcer and when the ulcer healed. Biopsies were taken from the antrum to assess histologically for: (1) the activity of gastritis as assessed by the degree of polymorph infiltration, (2) the degree of chronic inflammation by the degree of chronic inflammatory cells infiltration and degree of mucosal degeneration, and (3) bacteriologically for the presence of H. pylori. The severity of the gastritis and the bacterial density were graded independently by two pathologists. The patients were assessed at two-month intervals for 12 months or until the ulcer relapsed. The results demonstrated that the relapse rates of duodenal ulcer were similar in the three treatment groups. The relapse rate was higher in the group with higher density of the bacteria (P less than 0.05). The degree of gastritis did not affect the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer in either the placebo or misoprostol group or in all patients combined. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified that increased duodenal inflammation, male sex, early-onset disease, and H. pylori adversely affected relapse of the ulcer. We conclude that multiple factors affect the relapse of duodenal ulcer and H. pylori is one of them.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether Helicobacter pylori has an effect on gastroduodenal mucosal prostaglandin generation, mucosal biopsies were obtained from the gastric body, antrum, and duodenal bulb of 30 patients who were undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for clinical indications. One biopsy from the gastric body and one from the antrum were tested for urease activity (urea broth) and one biopsy from each area including the duodenum was processed for histology. Two other biopsies form each area were incubated and the accumulation of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha in the incubation medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Twelve of the 17 H. pylori-positive patients and seven of the 13 H. pylori-negative patients agreed to take bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) two tablets four times a day for four weeks. One week after treatment, these patients again underwent endoscopy and the above studies. This study indicates that: (1) mucosal PGE2 generation may be increased in the duodenum, gastric body, and antrum in H. pylori-positive patients compared to H. pylori-negative patients, and (2) treatment with bismuth subsalicylate for four weeks results in reduction of mucosal PGE2 in the duodenum, gastric body, and antrum of H. pylori-positive patients and fails to eradicate H. pylori or reduce gastric inflammation.\r"

While eosinophils have been observed to comprise part of the inflammatory reaction in acute Helicobacter pylori gastritis, the role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis is unknown. We evaluated whether eosinophil infiltration and degranulation are associated with chronic gastritis and H. pylori infection. We studied eight patients with chronic H. pylori antral gastritis, three with chronic antral gastritis in the absence of H. pylori, 11 healthy age-matched volunteers without antral gastritis, and eight patients with H. pylori-negative chronic specific gastritis (three Crohn's antral gastritis and five Menetrier's disease). Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, with Giemsa, and by a specific indirect immunofluorescence technique for eosinophil granule major basic protein. Specimens were graded independently by three observers and scores of 0-3 were given for eosinophil infiltration and degranulation (0 = none to 3 = confluent infiltration and/or degranulation). In H. pylori antral gastritis, significantly greater eosinophil infiltration and degranulation were found compared to the normal group, Menetrier's disease, and chronic H. pylori-negative gastritis. There was no significant difference between gastric Crohn's disease and H. pylori gastritis. The severity of chronic gastritis was significantly correlated with the eosinophil score. Eosinophil degranulation did not appear to be greater at or near sites of bacterial colonization in the H. pylori gastritis specimens. The results suggest that eosinophil infiltration and degranulation may be associated with H. pylori gastritis. We postulate that the release of toxic cationic proteins from eosinophils contributes to the inflammatory changes present in H. pylori gastritis.\r"

Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy.\r"

Light microscopy of the colon and cecum of the guinea pigs given the optimized treatment for ulcer induction revealed pronounced edema, inflammation, and lesions of the mucosa. Transmission electron microscopy of the mucosa from these animals showed the presence of large numbers of leukocytes in the subepithelial region, the majority being polymorphonuclear neutrophils which possessed large electron-dense granules or rods. Oral administration of 300 mg/kg/day sulfasalazine (salicylazosulfapyridine) for 14 days to guinea pigs given the optimized treatment for ulcer induction failed to reduce the numbers of ulcers or the histopathology gradings and fine structural changes of the mucosal inflammatory changes, but did reduce the symptoms of diarrhea.\r"

The prevalence of first-degree relatives with Crohn's disease was similar in the 98 and 45 families of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin: 5.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

Five were nonevaluable due to progression of AIDS symptomatology, and one was excluded because of lack of confirmation of HIV infection. Five of 11 evaluable patients responded to therapy (45%); two each at 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms, and one at 250 micrograms thrice daily doses. A sixth patient demonstrated a moderate reduction in stool volume at 250 micrograms thrice daily, which, although deemed clinically relevant, did not meet the criteria for response. On discontinuation of therapy, diarrhea recurred in all patients within 1-12 days, and responded to reinitiation of octreotide in those five patients who resumed treatment. Only one of the three patients with concurrent cryptosporidial infection responded to treatment. The drug was well tolerated, with mild symptomatology in three patients. Long-term treatment at a stable dose was effective in three of five treated patients for periods for seven months in one (moderate responder) and one year in two. One patient required dose increases to control symptoms, but after one year of treatment developed severe nausea following injections, which required dose cessation. One patient had partial control of his diarrhea for only three months despite two dose increases. These data suggest that octreotide may be of useful therapeutic value in HIV-associated diarrhea and that further studies are indicated.\r"

This technique has not yet been applied to the study of physiological cell renewal in the normal liver. In the present study, results obtained with this method in the liver of normal young adult rats is reported. BrdU was administered in vivo and subsequent incorporation was detected by the PAP technique using monoclonal anti-BrdU antibodies. The nuclei exhibiting a positive reaction within the liver were few and accounted for about 0.45% of all hepatocytes. Positive cells were located preferentially in zone 1, which contained 82.7% of the labeled cells. Zone 2 contained 15.4%, while only 1.9% of the labeled cells were found in zone 3. Positive-staining Kupffer cell nuclei were rare (about 0.5% of all Kupffer cells) and were distributed randomly in the hepatic lobule. These findings provide quantitative data about hepatocyte renewal in the normal liver in the absence of a growth stimulus. The simplicity and the reproducibility of this technique suggests that further application of this method in situations assessing hepatic regeneration are indicated.\r"

In vivo, the alpha 1 receptor's effect on DNA synthesis is restricted to early time points after partial hepatectomy. alpha 1 receptor binding capacity does not vary until 48 hr after liver resection (at which time binding is reduced), but an uncoupling of receptor binding from membrane phosphoinositide turnover occurs between 8 and 16 hr after partial hepatectomy. This change is preceded by a fall in membrane-associated ras p21 detected by radioimmunoassays (46% of control levels by 2 hr after partial hepatectomy). Whether this change represents a loss of p21 protein from membranes or a modification that results in a loss of immunoreactivity is not known.\r"

  ".W": "Mature hepatocytes in primary culture express most of the functions and hormonal responsiveness seen in normal liver studied in vivo. The growth of hepatocytes in culture is regulated by various growth factors. We have identified a hepatocyte growth factor that is isolated from rat platelets. We found that rat platelets also contain a growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor-beta which is secreted as a latent molecule. Its latency is due to its binding with a masking protein. Growth of hepatocytes is also suppressed by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6. Moreover, the growth and functions of liver cells in culture are regulated reciprocally by cell density: at higher cell density liver-specific functions are expressed and growth is suppressed, whereas the opposite situation is observed at lower cell density. In contrast, neonatal hepatocytes in culture grow autonomously without a requirement for added hormones. This autonomous growth is due to an autocrine mechanism in which the cells secrete one or more growth factors into the culture medium. However, this autonomous growth ceases one week after birth at a time when the cells begin to express differentiated characteristics. Based upon these data, the mechanisms of liver regeneration, differentiation, and hepatocarcinogenesis are discussed.\r"

The cytoplasm of cultured bile ductular cells reacts with an anti-laminin antibody, but loses immunoreactivity with a monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody.

Copper deficiency for seven to nine weeks causes an irreversible depletion of over 80% of the acinar cells in the pancreas. When transferred to a normal diet, these rats exhibit only a minimal and spotty acinar cell recovery. This disruption of tissue organization appears to trigger a profound change in cellular commitment, which leads to hepatocyte differentiation in the \"oval cells\" in the periductal interstitium and the epithelial cells lining the small pancreatic ductules. Pancreatic hepatocytes express several liver-specific genes including albumin, a2u-globulin, carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I, and urate oxidase. Both carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I and glutamine synthetase, the ammonia-metabolizing enzymes, are expressed by all pancreatic hepatocytes; in liver, these are expressed by different populations of hepatocytes. The magnitude of hepatocyte differentiation in this model should facilitate studies on the molecular events regulating changes in cell lineage or differentiation commitment within the pancreas.\r"

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and thymidine kinase (TK) activities in liver homogenates and immunohistochemistry of in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in hepatic DNA were followed as regeneration parameters at 24 and 48 hr after PH. The results relative to TK activity and BrdU incorporation were consistent with significantly delayed hepatic DNA synthesis in Gunn rats in comparison to control Wistar and TR- rats. This delay in DNA synthesis was not reflected in the hepatic ODC activity. After one week of complete common bile duct obstruction (CBO), an increased TK activity and BrdU incorporation was seen. PH following CBO resulted in a further increase in ODC activity and BrdU incorporation. TK activity did not change, however. These data relative to the regulation of hepatic DNA synthesis after PH in Gunn rats and in rats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction suggest a possible stimulatory role for conjugated bilirubin in hepatic regeneration; however, the normal hepatic DNA synthesis in TR- rats studied before PH and the subnormal DNA synthesis seen 24 hr after PH in TR- rats and in rats with CBO indicate that conjugated bilirubin does not stimulate hepatic DNA synthesis.\r"

Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

There were eight primary and 46 secondary cases of esophageal tuberculosis. There were more male than female patients (M/F = 2.6:1) with an average age of 39.2 years (range 6 months to 75 years). Diagnosis can be difficult, being based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features and on the response to chemotherapy. Most cases can be successfully treated with antituberculous chemotherapy even in the presence of fistulous tracts. Patients with esophageal tuberculosis in the presence of AIDS do not respond as well to antituberculous chemotherapy.\r"

Aides received one of two versions of an anonymous resident's medical chart, identical except for the inclusion of a one-page life history. Controlling for individual differences such as prior work experience and knowledge about aging, staff reviewing the chart with the life history rated that resident as more instrumental, autonomous, and personally acceptable than staff who reviewed the chart without the life history.\r"

Survey responses from 250 older community dwellers indicated that beliefs regarding care-related issues were more important determinants of their reactions to nursing homes than were the risks their own situation entailed. As predicted, fears about one day entering a nursing home and the perceived likelihood of so doing are best understood as responses to beliefs regarding the quality of residents' care, residents' quality of life, the costs of care, and family's role in providing care. The implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Equally important is the ability to establish care priorities. Current staging models are so general, however, that their usefulness is limited. Thus, this paper proposes a strategy that, using basic assessment data, categorizes dementia residents according to four key determinants of care needs: activities of daily living status, behavioral problems, communication abilities, and physical transition.\r"

Two global themes of maintaining control and increasing responsibility within the caregiver role were also evident. Case examples illustrate problems, and practice implications are considered.\r"

Findings support the usefulness of an expanded definition of autonomy, emphasizing the importance of goal-directed behavior, which may be inhibited by intrinsic conditions as well as external forces.\r"
