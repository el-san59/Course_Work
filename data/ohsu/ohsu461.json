  ".W": "Use of drugs for the treatment of obesity is regarded more skeptically than drug use in other chronic disease; this view, however, may be inappropriate. Anorexiant drugs, the major class of drugs currently available for treating obesity, differ in several important ways, including whether they act on noradrenergic or serotonergic systems and in their potential for abuse. New approaches to drug treatment of obesity include thermogenic agents and drugs acting on the digestive system and hormones.\r"

Despite numerous shortcomings and limitations, surgical methods are the only viable alternative for achieving and maintaining substantial weight loss in dangerously obese patients and, therefore, represent a legitimate, often life-saving, intervention. Nevertheless, the magnitude of weight loss varies widely, as does the number of patients lost to follow-up or requiring multiple operations. Safety of performing the surgery and recognition and successful treatment of side effects in cooperating patients has improved greatly over the past 10 years. More effort needs to be put into improving patient selection to allocate patients to specific types of operations and to identify those patients who may not require surgery.\r"

Each nutrient is regulated separately in a feedback system. 2. The control of glucose is regulated by the size of the glycogen stores; the size of the fat depots, by the rate of hepatic fatty acid oxidation; and protein, by the size of the protein depots. 3. Obesity can occur as a result of hyperphagia or from repartitioning the deposition of nutrients. In either case, there is a relative or absolute reduction in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, requiring adequate levels of circulating corticosteroids.\r"

Many of the factors thought to be of etiologic significance--field dependence, lack of impulse control, inability to delay gratification, or a maladaptive eating style--have not been supported by experimental evidence. Other factors once thought to be of importance as causes of obesity, depression and dysphoria, for example, appear, instead, to be consequences of being obese and may serve to maintain and intensify weight-related problems. Dieting behavior in response to weight concerns appears, perversely, to be implicated in increasing overweight and adiposity. Finally, arousability in response to food cues in the environment may play a causal role in some obesities.\r"

  ".U": "89096041\r", 
  ".W": "Several points should be emphasized in summarizing the role of biological inheritance in human body-fat variation. First, at least two kinds of genetic effects must be considered: the additive genetic effect and the genotype-environment interaction effect. Second, from the data reviewed here, we conclude that the additive genetic effect in amount of subcutaneous fat is quite low but that it is higher (around 25 to 30 per cent) for fat mass and regional fat distribution. These results suggest that visceral fat, perhaps, is more influenced by the genotype than subcutaneous fat. Third, it appears that a genotype-overfeeding interaction component exists for body fat, which suggests that sensitivity of individuals to changes in body fat following overfeeding are genotype-dependent. Fourth, the limited data available suggest that the genotype accounts for a significant fraction (equal to or greater than 40 per cent) of the individual differences in RMR, TEM, and TEE. Fifth, one finds a slight genetic effect for the proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the diet. Sixth, there is some indication that individual differences in habitual physical activity level are characterized by a significant genetic component. The search for genetic markers of the various obesity phenotypes has not been initiated to any extent at this time. However, one can anticipate considerable development in this area in the coming decade.\r"

Although there is much discrepancy of results, the following are obvious: Obesity is not a clear-cut syndrome, and individuals differ significantly in their genetic subtypes and in the stages, type, and degree of their metabolic disturbances. A difference in the facultative component of the thermogenic effect of food can explain some of the variation. This in turn is closely related to insulin resistance, which bears a close relationship to subtypes of hypertension and hyperlipidemias. The greatest scope for clinical intervention lies in these fields. Both the obese and the lean subjects are adapted to retain dietary fat independently of the energy needs. The high ratio of fat to carbohydrate in the western diet and, increasingly in that of the east, is cause for concern.\r"

The ratio of squamous cell carcinoma to basal cell carcinoma was 15:1. Most viral warts showed significant epidermal dysplasia, and keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas had signs of human papilloma virus infection. 15 (60%) of 25 squamous cell carcinomas contained HPV5/8 DNA and 1 contained HPV4 DNA--HPV5/8 DNA was detected in skin lesions of recipients with cancers significantly more often than in those matched for duration and type of immunosuppression with nonmalignant skin lesions. The findings suggest a role for HPV5/8 in the aetiology of squamous cell carcinoma in renal allograft recipients.\r"

The polyclonal antiserum stained the mesangium in all patients. The CMV staining coincided only partially with that of IgA in five patients and the staining distributions were discordant in six. The monoclonal antibodies stained mesangium in only one patient. Serum levels of IgA and IgG anti-CMV antibodies did not differ between patients and controls. In western blot analysis, the polyclonal antiserum reacted with three proteins in uninfected human fibroblasts. Absorption of the antiserum with uninfected fibroblasts reduced the reactivity on western blot analysis and eliminated glomerular staining in five of six renal biopsy samples. It is concluded that the previously reported binding of anti-CMV antibodies to glomeruli from patients with IgA nephropathy may be the result of contaminating antibodies to human antigens.\r"

In men, habitual snoring was associated with hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, with adjusted relative risks in the range 1.3-2.0. For women, only one study provided adjusted estimates of relative risk, which were 2.8 for hypertension and 1.2 for angina. Adequately adjusted relative risks for cerebrovascular disease have not been reported, but unadjusted estimates varied from 1.6 to 10.3. These studies had several limitations, including the lack of a standard definition of snoring, the use of unvalidated questionnaires, and failure to account for confounding variables and the possibility of reporting bias. Only one study was prospective. Epidemiological criteria for a causal association between snoring and vascular disease have not been satisfied. The apparent excess risk is probably due to the consequences of sleep apnoea rather than snoring itself.\r"

Each patient was followed up for 2 years or until termination of the trial. The primary endpoint was a thromboembolic complication (stroke, transient cerebral ischaemic attack, or embolic complications to the viscera and extremities). The secondary endpoint was death. The incidence of thromboembolic complications and vascular mortality were significantly lower in the warfarin group than in the aspirin and placebo groups, which did not differ significantly. 5 patients on warfarin had thromboembolic complications compared with 20 patients on aspirin and 21 on placebo. 21 patients on warfarin were withdrawn because of non-fatal bleeding complications compared with 2 on aspirin and none on placebo. Thus, anticoagulation therapy with warfarin can be recommended to prevent thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic non-rheumatic AF.\r"

  ".U": "89097100\r", 
  ".W": "Omeprazole blocks the action of H+,K+-ATPase in the gastric mucosa and thus inhibits the secretion of hydrochloric acid. We conducted a double-blind multicenter study (45 centers in 13 countries) of 602 patients with benign gastric or prepyloric ulcers to compare the effectiveness of omeprazole (20 mg once daily, 203 patients, or 40 mg once daily, 194 patients) and ranitidine, an H2-receptor antagonist (150 mg twice daily, 205 patients) in promoting ulcer healing and to evaluate the pattern of ulcer relapse during a six-month follow-up. Healing occurred at four weeks in 80 percent of the patients receiving 40 mg of omeprazole, 69 percent of those receiving 20 mg of omeprazole, 69 percent of those receiving ranitidine. At eight weeks, the corresponding figures were 96, 89, and 85 percent. A multivariate analysis of ulcer healing showed that at four weeks the ulcers of significantly more patients receiving omeprazole had healed as compared with patients receiving ranitidine (omeprazole, 40 mg, vs. ranitidine, P less than 0.0005; omeprazole, 20 mg, vs. ranitidine, P = 0.01). At eight weeks, the 40-mg dose of omeprazole was significantly more effective than ranitidine (P = 0.001) or the 20-mg dose of omeprazole (P = 0.03). Ulcer symptoms were relieved faster with omeprazole. In 68 patients receiving concurrent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the healing rates at four weeks were 81 percent in the group receiving 40 mg of omeprazole, 61 percent in the group receiving 20 mg, and 32 percent in the group receiving ranitidine; at eight weeks, the corresponding figures were 95, 82, and 53 percent. During the six-month follow-up period (without treatment), significantly more patients in the omeprazole groups were free of symptoms and ulcers than in the ranitidine group. We conclude that in the dose used, omeprazole is superior to ranitidine in the treatment of benign gastric ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-seven patients thought to have dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi were randomly assigned to undergo endoscopic sphincterotomy or sham sphincterotomy in a prospective double-blind study. All the patients had pain resembling biliary pain, had previously undergone a cholecystectomy, and had clinical characteristics suggesting biliary obstruction. The patients were randomly assigned to the treatment (n = 23) or nontreatment (n = 24) group before manometric examination of the sphincter of Oddi was performed. Sphincterotomy resulted in improvement in pain scores at one-year follow-up in 10 of 11 patients with elevated sphincter pressure. In contrast, there was improvement in only 3 of 12 patients with elevated basal sphincter pressures who underwent the sham procedure. In patients with normal sphincter pressure, pain scores were similar regardless of treatment. After one year, sphincterotomy was performed in 12 symptomatic patients who had undergone the sham procedure--7 with elevated sphincter pressures and 5 with normal sphincter pressures. Forty patients were followed for four years. Of the 23 patients with increased sphincter pressure, 10 of the original 11 who underwent sphincterotomy remained virtually free of pain; 7 others who subsequently underwent sphincterotomy also benefited from it. Thus, 17 of 18 patients with sphincter-of-Oddi dysfunction verified by manometry benefited from sphincterotomy. In patients with normal sphincter pressure, sphincterotomy was no more beneficial than sham therapy. Our observations suggest that endoscopic sphincterotomy offers long-term relief of pain in a group of patients with verified sphincter-of-Oddi dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "A deficiency of the protein dystrophin is known to be the cause of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. To examine the expression of dystrophin in symptomatic female carriers of this X-linked recessive disorder, we performed immunohistochemical studies on muscle-biopsy specimens from three such carriers, using an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide fragment of dystrophin. In all three carriers, most individual muscle fibers reacted either strongly or not at all to the antiserum for dystrophin; only 2 to 8 percent of fibers showed partial immunostaining. This mosaic staining pattern was present on both cross-sectional and longitudinal muscle specimens. Although the mosaic pattern was seen in all fiber types, more than 80 percent of type 2B and 2C fibers from two of the carriers did not react with the antiserum. Similar studies in nine normal subjects showed consistently strong staining of all muscle fibers. No muscle fibers from 31 patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy reacted with the antiserum. We conclude that symptomatic carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy can be identified by a distinct mosaic pattern in the immunohistochemical staining of the surface membrane of skeletal-muscle specimens. This finding may have practical implications for genetic counseling, although it remains to be shown whether the same staining pattern will be found in muscle specimens from asymptomatic carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".U": "89097107\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the risk of nephrotoxicity induced by the infusion of radiographic contrast material, we undertook a prospective study of consecutive patients undergoing radiographic procedures with intravascular contrast material. There were three study groups: patients with diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (n = 85), patients with preexisting renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level, greater than or equal to 150 mumol per liter) without diabetes (n = 101), and patients with both diabetes and renal insufficiency (n = 34). The control group consisted of patients undergoing CT scanning or abdominal imaging procedures without the infusion of contrast material who had diabetes mellitus (n = 59), preexisting renal insufficiency (n = 145), or both (n = 64). Clinically important acute renal failure (defined as an increase of greater than 50 percent in the serum creatinine level) attributable to the contrast material did not occur in nondiabetic patients with preexisting renal insufficiency or in diabetics with normal renal function. The incidence of clinically important contrast-induced renal failure among the diabetic patients with preexisting renal insufficiency was 8.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 23.7 percent), as compared with 1.6 percent for the controls. The incidence of acute renal insufficiency, more broadly defined as an increase of greater than 25 percent in the serum creatinine level after the infusion of contrast material, was 11.8 percent among all patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. After the exclusion of patients whose acute renal insufficiency could be attributed to other causes, the incidence was 7.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 12.8 percent), as compared with 1.5 percent in the control group. The risk of acute renal insufficiency attributable to the contrast material was therefore 5.5 percent, and the relative risk associated with the infusion of contrast material was 4.7. These rates were similar whether the osmolarity of the contrast material was high or low. We conclude that there is little risk of clinically important nephrotoxicity attributable to contrast material for patients with diabetes and normal renal function or for nondiabetic patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. The risk for those with both diabetes and preexisting renal insufficiency is about 9 percent, which is lower than previously reported.\r"

To examine the relative nephrotoxicity of the two types of agents, we randomly assigned 443 patients to receive either iopamidol (nonionic) or diatrizoate (ionic) for cardiac catheterization. The patients were stratified into low-risk (n = 283) or high-risk (n = 160) groups, on the basis of the presence of diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or preexisting renal insufficiency (base-line serum creatinine level, greater than 133 mumol per liter). Serum and urine analyses were performed at base line and 24 and 48 hours after the infusion of contrast material. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level within 48 hours of at least 44 mumol per liter. The median maximal rise in the serum creatinine level was 18 mumol per liter in both the diatrizoate group (n = 235) and the iopamidol group (n = 208) (P not significant; power to detect a difference greater than 9 mumol per liter, greater than 90 percent). Creatinine levels increased by at least 44 mumol per liter (0.5 mg per deciliter) in 10.2 percent of the patients receiving diatrizoate and 8.2 percent of the patients receiving iopamidol (P not significant). Among the high-risk patients, creatinine levels increased by at least 44 mumol per liter in 17 percent of the patients in the diatrizoate group, as compared with 15 percent of the patients in the iopamidol group (P not significant). We were unable to demonstrate a difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between patients receiving a non-ionic contrast agent and those receiving an ionic contrast agent.\r"

Each year, more and more monogenic disorders can be added to the list of diseases that can be diagnosed by DNA analysis. Future research will be devoted to the identification of genes responsible for other known monogenic hereditary disorders, the elucidation of the molecular lesion associated with chromosomal abnormalities, and the characterization of the genes and gene defects involved in the common multifactorial diseases. The goal of diagnosis is the identification of the genetic defect in affected patients, persons destined to be affected, and carriers.\r"

  ".U": "89097124\r", 
  ".W": "We analyzed the relevance of HLA compatibility to sustained marrow engraftment in 269 patients with hematologic neoplasms who underwent bone marrow transplantations. Each patient received marrow from a family member who shared one HLA haplotype with the patient but differed to a variable degree for the HLA-A, B, and D antigens of the haplotype not shared. These 269 patients were compared with 930 patients who received marrow from siblings with identical HLA genotypes. All patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by the infusion of unmodified donor marrow cells. The rate of graft failure was 12.3 percent among the recipients of marrow from a donor with only one identical haplotype, as compared with 2.0 percent among recipients of marrow from a sibling with the same HLA genotype (both haplotypes inherited from the same parents) (P less than 0.0001). The incidence of graft failure correlated with the degree of donor HLA incompatibility. Graft failure occurred in 3 of 43 transplants (7 percent) from donors who were phenotypically HLA-matched with their recipient (haplotypes similar, but not inherited from the same parents), in 11 of 121 donors (9 percent) incompatible for one HLA locus, in 18 of 86 (21 percent) incompatible for two loci, and in 1 of 19 (5 percent) incompatible for three loci (P = 0.028). In a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors associated with graft failure were donor incompatibility for HLA-B and D (relative risk = 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.5; P = 0.0004) and a positive crossmatch for anti-donor lymphocytotoxic antibody (relative risk = 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 2.8; P = 0.0038). Residual host lymphocytes were detected in 11 of 14 patients with graft failure, suggesting that the mechanism for graft failure could be host-mediated immune rejection. We conclude that donor HLA incompatibility and prior alloimmunization are significant risk factors for graft failure, and that a more effective immunosuppressive regimen than those currently used is needed for consistent achievement of sustained engraftment of marrow transplanted from donors who are not HLA-identical siblings.\r"

The mean duration of follow-up was 48 months. Patients in the prednisone group (median age, 46 years) entered with a mean disease duration of 15 months, a median creatinine clearance of 1.2 ml per second per 1.73 m2 (range, 0.25 to 2.6), and a median rate of urinary protein excretion of 6.8 g per day (0.3 to 26). The annual change in the corrected creatinine clearance at six months did not differ between the prednisone group and the control group (0.10 vs. 0.06 ml per second; P = 0.8), or at the last follow-up evaluation (-0.07 vs. -0.02 ml per second; P = 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval on the difference, -0.03 to 0.13). The proportion of patients with complete remission of proteinuria was also similar in the groups at 6 and 12 months and after a mean of 48 months. Outcomes were similar in the two groups with respect to progression to renal failure (3 vs. 4 patients), death (3 vs. 1 patient), complete remission of proteinuria at 36 months (16 vs. 19 patients), and a decline of 25 percent or more in the creatinine clearance at 60 months (32 vs. 25 percent of patients). A multivariate analysis, which adjusted for differences at entry in sex distribution, urinary protein excretion, and creatinine concentration, as well as other prognostic variables, failed to provide an explanation for the lack of effect of prednisone. We conclude that a six-month course of therapy in which prednisone is given on alternate days is of no benefit to patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy.\r"

Extensive bacterial cultures of the synovial fluid were negative. All the samples were studied by immunofluorescence with use of a rabbit antiserum to Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 and a monoclonal antibody to Y. enterocolitica O:3 lipopolysaccharide. Synovial-fluid cells from 41 patients with other rheumatic diseases served as controls. Synovial-fluid cells from 10 patients with reactive arthritis after yersinia infection stained positively on immunofluorescence; rabbit antiserum and the monoclonal antibody yielded similar results. In most patients the percentage of positive cells ranged from 1 to 10 percent, but in one patient nearly all the cells in the sample stained strongly. Most of the positively stained cells were polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but yersinia antigens were also found in mononuclear phagocytes. All the control samples were negative. Synovial-fluid cell deposits from nine patients were also studied by Western blotting with use of the same antibodies. The results were positive in six of the nine cell deposits from patients with reactive arthritis and in none of the 10 cell deposits from control patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We conclude that in patients with reactive arthritis after yersinia infection, microbial antigens can be found in synovial-fluid cells from the affected joints.\r"

Overuse injuries involving the muscle--tendon unit are the most common problem, with symptoms ranging from mild pain while the musician is playing to pain severe enough to preclude any use of the affected hand. String players are the most commonly affected, and percussionists the least. The most important predisposing characteristic is the use of repetitive movements during long hours of practice, but awkward body positions mandated by the shape and weight of the instrument, the technical difficulty of the repertoire, and unfamiliar instruments may also play a part. Women are more commonly affected than men. Rest is the cornerstone of therapy. Neural impingement syndromes affecting the median or ulnar nerves or the thoracic outlet affect many musicians. Focal dystonias may involve part or all of a hand or the muscles forming the embouchure (the position of the lips in wind players). These are very resistant to therapy and may terminate or drastically alter a career. Stress, especially performance anxiety, may impede performance. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents prevent the symptoms of performance anxiety and are frequently used by musicians without medical supervision. A recognition of the unique problems of musician-patients has led to the formation of successful specialty clinics in a number of cities.\r"

As injected muscle precursor cells of one genotype can fuse with host muscle fibres of a different genotype and express the donor genes, we decided to test grafts of normal muscle precursor cells to see if they could induce synthesis of dystrophin in innately dystrophin-deficient mdx muscle fibres. We show that injected normal muscle precursor cells can fuse with pre-existing or regenerating mdx muscle fibres to render many of these fibres dystrophin-positive and so to partially or wholly rescue them from their biochemical defect.\r"

  ".W": "To identify environmental carcinogens there is a need for inexpensive and reliable short-term tests, but certain human or animal carcinogens are persistently undetectable as mutagents with the Ames assay or with other short-term tests currently in use. Thus there is a need for short-term tests which detect carcinogens missed by the Ames assay. Because of the association of carcinogenesis with genome rearrangement, a system screening for intrachromosomal recombination resulting in genome rearrangement has been constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evaluation of this system shows inducibility by a variety of carcinogens not detectable by the Ames assay or various other short-term tests. In the light of these results it is tempting to speculate that 'nongenotoxic carcinogens' are in fact genotoxic but, in the past, the tools to measure the genetic alterations they induce have been inappropriate.\r"

  ".W": "Kawasaki syndrome, an acute febrile multisystem illness of young children, is a panvasculitis with prominent rheumatic features. Arthritis and pancarditis are frequent during the acute stage; coronary artery aneurysms occur in 20% of cases and the disease is now the leading cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. A microbial aetiology is suggested by the acute febrile self-limited character of the disease, the regular occurrence of epidemic outbreaks at intervals of 2-3 years, and the virtual restriction to young children, consistent with the early acquisition of immunity. Reports of elevated DNA polymerase activity (assumed to be RNA-dependent reverse transcriptase) in cultured lymphocytes from patients with acute Kawasaki syndrome suggest that a retrovirus might be the causative agent. We have measured supernatant DNA polymerase activity in lymphocyte cultures from 49 Hawaiian patients in acute and convalescent stages of Kawasaki syndrome and have been unable to demonstrate significant reverse transcriptase activity or other evidence of involvement of a retrovirus in the aetiology of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Retroviruses and many other types of genetic elements replicate by reverse transcription of RNA. Although structurally and biologically very diverse, such elements carry conserved polymerase genes (pol) that encode proteins required for reverse transcription. In most cases, the pol gene is preceded by an overlapping gene encoding one or more nucleocapsid proteins, in a different reading frame. Because both coding regions are represented in a single mRNA, the question arises of how the reverse transcriptase in the alternative reading frame is expressed. In retroviruses and retrotransposons it is expressed as a nucleocapsid-polymerase fusion protein by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the overlapping region. We have examined the mechanism of polymerase biosynthesis in another family of animal viruses that use reverse transcription, the hepatitis B viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies reveal that these viruses do not use ribosomal frameshifting to generate this enzyme, but instead direct translation initiation at an internal initiation (AUG) codon in the polymerase gene.\r"

For example, several viruses commonly detected in AIDS patients and capable of transactivating the long terminal repeat of HIV-1, such as herpesviruses, papovaviruses, adenoviruses and HTLV-I have been suggested as potential cofactors. Another candidate is human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6, originally designated human B-lymphotropic virus), which has not only been identified in most patients with AIDS by virus isolation, DNA amplification techniques and serological analysis, but is also predominantly tropic and cytopathic in vitro for CD4+ T lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that HHV-6 and HIV-1 can productively co-infect individual human CD4+ T lymphocytes, resulting in accelerated HIV-1 expression and cellular death. We also present evidence that HHV-6 transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). These observations indicate that HHV-6 might contribute directly or indirectly to the depletion of CD4+ T cells in AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "89097313\r", 
  ".W": "It has long been suspected that chloroplasts evolved after an endosymbiotic event involving a photosynthetic prokaryote, presumably a cyanobacterium, and a eukaryotic organism. Recent studies have provided strong evidence about the cyanobacterial nature of chloroplasts. Since the discovery of prochlorophytes, oxygen-evolving photosynthetic prokaryotes containing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and lacking phycobiliproteins, there has been speculation that these represent evolutionary intermediates between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Prochloron sp., the first described prochlorophyte, proved difficult to work with because it is an obligate symbiont of marine ascidians. Prochlorothrix hollandica, a recently isolated, freshwater filamentous prochlorophyte, is easily maintained in the laboratory. Overall pigment composition and thylakoid membrane structure of P. hollandica suggest it has intermediate characteristics between cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of higher plants. The P. hollandica psbA genes, which encode the photosystem II thylakoid protein D1, were cloned and sequenced and the sequences compared to those reported for cyanobacteria, a green alga, a liverwort, and several higher plants. The two psbA genes present in P. hollandica encode an identical amino-acid sequence. As in all chloroplast psbA genes, there is a seven amino-acid gap near the C terminus of the derived protein relative to the protein predicted by cyanobacterial genes, suggesting that P. hollandica is part of the lineage that led to chloroplasts after a divergence from cyanobacteria. This hypothesis is also supported by phylogenetic analysis of derived D1 amino-acid sequences from psbA genes of thirteen taxa on the basis of parsimony.\r"

  ".W": "Cysteine proteinases are important not only in the intracellular catabolism of peptides and proteins and in the processing of prohormones and proenzymes, but also in the penetration of normal human tissue by malignant cells and possibly microorganisms, including viruses. Cystatin C is a human cysteine proteinase inhibitor present in extracellular fluids. We have synthesized peptide derivatives mimicking the proposed proteinase-binding centre of cystatin C and find that they irreversibly inhibit cysteine proteinases. Several bacteria produce proteinases, so we tested a tripeptide derivative (Z-LVG-CHN2) for in vitro anti-bacterial activity against a large number of bacterial strains belonging to thirteen different species. It was found to inhibit specifically the growth of all strains of group A streptococci. The susceptibility of these human pathogens to the peptide was compared with that to well-established anti-streptococcal antibiotics such as tetracycline and bacitracin. Moreover, the peptide was active in vivo against group A streptococci: mice injected with lethal doses of these bacteria were cured by a single injection of Z-LVG-CHN2. The cysteine proteinase produced by group A streptococci was isolated and found to be inhibited by Z-LVG-CHN2; moreover, excess proteinase relieved the growth inhibition caused by the peptide derivative, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of Z-LVG-CHN2 is due to inhibition of this cysteine proteinase. This strategy of blocking proteinases with peptide derivatives that mimic naturally occurring inhibitors could be useful in the construction of new agents against other microorganisms, including viruses.\r"

Of these, 21 pregnant women, including seven vaginectomy patients, were matched to 84 low-risk controls to determine the following: 1) the effect of DES exposure on reproductive performance, 2) the efficacy of ultrasound selection of cerclage candidates, and 3) the influence of previous partial vaginectomy on reproductive outcome. Five DES-exposed patients were diagnosed as having cervical incompetency and had cerclages placed. There were no missed diagnoses of cervical incompetency. The DES-exposed patients delivered statistically earlier in gestation than did controls (268 +/- 13 versus 276 +/- 10 days). It was not evident that this difference was important clinically, as there were no neonatal deaths, very low birth weight infants, second-trimester losses, or deliveries before 252 days (36 weeks) among the study patients. Previous vaginectomy did not affect the frequency of the diagnosis of cervical failure or the neonatal outcome. After ultrasound surveillance and treatment for incompetent cervix, a majority of our patients delivered at term without cerclage placement. Therefore, routine cerclage placement is not recommended. Knowledge of the ultrasound criteria for diagnosing cervical incompetency is required.\r"

Three singleton gestations had upper gastrointestinal obstruction and normal fetal urine output of 18.7, 18.0, and 12.3 mL/hour at 35, 35, and 31 weeks' gestation, respectively. Markedly elevated fetal urine output of 18 mL/hour (tenth to 95th percentile at 26 weeks, 4-7 mL/hour) was present in one fetus that was subsequently found to have diabetes insipidus. The remaining two singleton pregnancies with idiopathic hydramnios had upper limits of normal fetal urine output of 10 and 13 mL/hour at 31 and 32 weeks, respectively. It appears that hydramnios may be the result of polyuria of the hyperperfused twin in cases of twin-twin transfusion or diabetes insipidus. In upper gastrointestinal obstruction or idiopathic hydramnios, increased fetal urination does not appear to be present.\r"

Using linear equations, no significant difference was found in systematic errors between pregnancies with a known date of conception and pregnancies dated from the last menstrual period (LMP). Pregnancies with reliable LMPs had only a slight and nonsignificant increase in random errors when compared with pregnancies from IVF. Current polynomial dating equations produced considerable systematic and random errors as well as errors related to fetal growth. Acceptable results were obtained with a new linear equation based on two examinations. We conclude that gestational age based on good menstrual records supported by a pelvic examination in the first trimester may be more reliable than even the best ultrasound method for dating.\r"

After the visit for instrumentation, 40 patients with asymptomatic teeth having vital-inflamed pulps were randomly given either dexamethasone (3 tablets of 4 mg each) or a dextrose placebo identical in appearance (same dosage schedule). The outcome showed that the oral administration of dexamethasone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in endodontic interappointment pain at all three time periods evaluated, that is, at 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours (p less than 0.01). It appears from the results of this study that this dosage schedule of oral dexamethasone is sufficient to significantly reduce endodontic interappointment pain for teeth with asymptomatic vital-inflamed pulps. Further studies are needed for teeth with other endodontic pulpal-periapical conditions and for symptomatic teeth.\r"

In the first experiment, it was hypothesized that subjects listening to easy-listening music would report lower pain ratings and cardiovascular responses than subjects listening to rock music, self-selected music, or a dissertation (placebo-attention) and subjects in a no-treatment control group. No significant group effects were found; significant time effects were found for heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Subjects spontaneously reported using imagery as a pain reduction technique. In the second study a combination of music and imagery was examined by randomly assigning subjects to one of five groups: self-generated imagery with music (SIM), guided imagery with music (GIM), self-generated imagery without music (SI), guided imagery without music (GI), or no-treatment control. Again, no significant group effects were obtained. Significant time effects were obtained for heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Forty patients less than 4 years postrenal transplant rated the severity of 35 potential stressors on a 5-point scale. Patients then rated the extent to which they used each of 40 coping strategies to deal with stress. The most stressful items were cost factors and fear of kidney rejection; fear of not being accepted by family and friends was least stressful. Prayer and looking at the problem objectively were used most in coping with stress. Drug and alcohol use and blaming others for your problems were used least. Problem-oriented coping scores were significantly higher than affective-oriented scores, t (39) = 10.10, p less than .001. Patients 24 to 48 months posttransplant had significantly higher total stressor scores than patients less than 2 years posttransplant. However, the rankings of stressors by mean severity ratings were significantly correlated. Patients 24 to 48 months posttransplant were not significantly different from patients up to 23 months posttransplant with respect to total coping scores and total problem-oriented scores, but they did differ significantly on total affective-oriented scores. The rank orderings of coping methods according to mean degree of use were significantly correlated between the two subgroups, rs = .87. These findings suggest that renal patients may experience continuing stressors of moderate intensity as long as 4 years posttransplant.\r"

A 2800-base-pair (bp) rat beta-casein gene fragment containing 2300 bp of 5' flanking sequence was placed in front of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and stably transfected into the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11. Addition of prolactin or dexamethasone alone was sufficient for a modest induction of the fusion gene. The simultaneous presence of both hormones produced a strongly synergistic effect, which did not require the presence of insulin. Induction of the beta-casein-CAT gene was only observed in stably transfected confluent cell cultures. Analysis of a 5' deletion series of the beta-casein-CAT gene construct revealed a stepwise loss of hormone inducibility; 285 bp of 5' flanking sequence was sufficient to mediate the synergistic action of lactogenic hormones on expression. The response was reduced by half when compared with the construct containing 2300 bp of the 5' flanking region. Synergistic inducibility further decreased in deletion mutants between -285 and -265 and was completely abolished between -180 and -170. Thus, the 5' flanking region between -285 and -170 contains cis-acting sequences, which are required for mediating the effect of prolactin and dexamethasone.\r"

In vivo production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from a gene construct lacking its native ribosomal binding site was enhanced 40- to 120-fold by the presence of omega delta 3. Similar levels of enhancement (30- to 240-fold) were observed when the gene encoding beta-glucuronidase was tested. With a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct containing a ribosomal binding site, enhancement was markedly less, between 1- and 3.8-fold. Omega delta 3 appeared to enhance translation independent of its position upstream of the AUG codon used for initiation.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is cytotoxic to certain transformed cells, whereas normal cells are resistant to its effects. The resistance of normal cells can often be overcome by treatment with inhibitors of transcription or translation such as actinomycin D or cycloheximide (CHI), suggesting that normal cells produce a protein(s) that protects them from TNF-induced cytolysis. In this report, we examine the mechanism of cytolysis in a 3T3-like mouse cell line, C3HA, which was sensitized to TNF by treatment with CHI. We found that an early change in TNF/CHI-treated cells was a significant loss of stress fibers in perinuclear areas of the cytoplasm. The disruption of microfilaments, which was observed within 15 min of treatment, was not seen in untreated cells or in cells treated with either TNF or CHI alone. The dissolution of microfilaments spread peripherally over time and preceded other TNF/CHI-induced effects such as cytoplasmic \"boiling,\" decrease in cell volume, and lysis of the plasma membrane. The breakdown of stress fibers occurred without a change in microtubules or intermediate filaments. Cytochalasin E, which disrupts microfilaments, induced cytolysis of TNF-treated cells even in the absence of CHI; however, demecolcine, which depolymerizes microtubules, did not sensitize cells to TNF. We propose that the TNF-induced cytolysis of certain cell types is preceded by a selective disruption of the microfilament lattice.\r"

To extend these studies of the T24 HRAS in human cells, we have utilized an infinite life-span, but otherwise phenotypically normal, human fibroblast cell strain, MSU-1.1, developed in this laboratory after transfection of diploid fibroblasts with a viral v-myc oncogene. Transfection of MSU-1.1 cells with the T24 HRAS flanked by two transcriptional enhancer elements (pHO6T1) yielded foci of morphologically transformed cells. No such transformation occurred if the plasmid containing T24 HRAS had only one enhancer or none at all or if the normal human HRAS gene was transfected in the pHO6 vector (pHO6N1). Cell strains derived from such foci expressed high levels of T24 HRAS product p21, formed colonies in soft agar at high frequency, proliferated rapidly in serum-free medium that does not support growth of the parental cell line, and formed progressively growing, invasive fibrosarcomas. These foci-derived T24 HRAS-transformed cell strains, as well as cells from the tumors derived from them, had the same near-diploid karyotype as that of the parental MSU-1.1 cells. Transfection of pHO6T1 into two other infinite life-span human fibroblast cell lines, cells that had not been transfected with v-myc, also resulted in malignant transformation, suggesting that the infinite life-span phenotype of MSU-1.1 cells, and not necessarily expression of the v-myc oncogene, was the factor that complemented T24 HRAS expression to cause malignant transformation.\r"

  ".U": "89098880\r", 
  ".W": "The esperamicins represent a class of antitumor antibiotics characterized by an unusual chemical core structure and extremely potent cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which these drugs produce cytotoxicity was investigated and found to be related to the formation of single- and double-strand DNA breaks. Using five structurally related analogs, we defined a structure-activity relationship for cytotoxicity in various eukaryotic and DNA-repair-deficient prokaryotic cell lines, for DNA breakage in a human colon carcinoma cell line, and for DNA breakage in vitro in pBR322 DNA. Mild reducing agents such as dithiothreitol greatly increased the DNA breakage potency of these analogs in vitro. Results suggest that the pendant aromatic chromophore of esperamicin A1 may contribute to the uptake of the drug into cells but may also hinder double-strand DNA break formation. Little DNA breakage specificity was observed for the drug in a 139-base-pair fragment of pBR322 DNA. Evidence supports a previously proposed mechanism whereby esperamicins may produce the observed DNA breaks through reduction of the methyl trisulfide group to a thiolate anion followed by a Michael addition of the anion across the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. This addition may result in the saturation of the bridgehead double bond, thus allowing the two triple bonds to approach each other, causing cyclization of the diyn-ene to form a phenylene diradical. It is likely that this diradical is the active form of the drug responsible for single- and double-strand DNA breakage produced by this class of antitumor agents.\r"

The L27' cDNA was expressed in yeast to determine the ability of the mouse protein to substitute for yeast L29 in assembling a functional ribosome. In a yeast strain resistant to cycloheximide by virtue of a recessive mutation in the L29 protein, the murine cDNA did not produce a sensitive phenotype, indicating failure of the mouse L27' protein to assemble into yeast ribosomes. However, when the mouse L27' gene was expressed in cells devoid of L29 and otherwise inviable, the murine protein supported normal growth, demonstrating that mouse ribosomal protein L27' indeed was interchangeable with yeast L29. We conclude that mouse ribosomal protein L27' is assembled into ribosomes in yeast, but yeast L29 is assembled preferentially when both L29 and L27' are present in the same cell.\r"

Cells with substitution of exogenous sequences into a chromosomal locus were enriched, by a factor of 100, using a positive genetic selection that specifically selects for homologous recombination at the targeted site. The selection is based on the conditional expression of a dominant selectable marker by virtue of in-frame gene fusion with the target gene. The dominant selectable marker was derived by modification of the Escherichia coli neo gene so that it retains significant activity in mammalian cells after in-frame fusion with heterologous coding sequences. In the example presented here, homologous recombinants were efficiently recovered from a pool in which the targeted gene was disrupted in 1 per 10,000 cells incorporating exogenous DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) can be used to distinguish two DNA molecules that differ by as little as a single-base substitution. This method detects approximately 50% of all possible single-base changes in DNA fragments ranging from 50 to approximately 1000 base pairs. To increase the number of single-base changes that can be distinguished by DGGE, we used the polymerase chain reaction to attach a 40-base-pair G + C-rich sequence, designated a GC-clamp, to one end of amplified DNA fragments that encompass regions of the mouse and human beta-globin genes. We show that this GC-clamp allows the detection of mutations, including the hemoglobin sickle (HbS) and hemoglobin C (HbC) mutations within the human beta-globin gene, that were previously indistinguishable by DGGE. In addition to providing an easy way to attach a GC-clamp to genomic DNA fragments, the polymerase chain reaction technique greatly increases the sensitivity of DGGE. With this approach, DNA fragments derived from less than 5 ng of human genomic DNA can be detected by ethidium bromide staining of the gel, obviating the need for radioactive probes. These improvements extend the applicability of DGGE for the detection of polymorphisms and mutations in genomic and cloned DNA.\r"

We isolated a cDNA clone for the human neutrophil alpha M subunit by screening a lambda gt 11 cDNA library made from chronic myelogenous leukemia neutrophils by using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the alpha M subunit. We used this cDNA clone to obtain additional clones from cDNA libraries made from differentiated HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Together these cDNAs constitute the complete 1137-amino acid sequence for the mature human alpha M subunit protein. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates the presence of an extensive extracellular domain with three putative metal-binding regions, (i) an amino acid region that is homologous to the A domain of von Willebrand factor, (ii) a 26-amino acid hydrophobic sequence that is a potential transmembrane domain, and (iii) a 19-amino acid cytoplasmic region. The amino acid sequence for the human neutrophil alpha M subunit contains regions that are closely related to amino acid sequences of adhesion receptors belonging to the integrin family.\r"

  ".W": "C5a is an inflammatory mediator potentially involved in a number of diseases. To help define which of its 74 residues are important for receptor binding and response triggering, changes in the amino acid sequence of C5a were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Synthetic C5a-encoding genes incorporating point mutations were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity. Modifications of the C5a molecule causing parallel reductions in binding to polymorphonuclear leukocyte membranes and in stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte locomotion (chemokinesis) suggest that carboxyl-terminal residues Lys-68, Leu-72, and Arg-74 interact with the receptor. Substitutions in the disulfide-linked core of C5a revealed involvement of Arg-40 or nearby residues, because potency losses were associated with only localized conformational changes as detected by NMR. Surprisingly, a substitution at core residue Ala-26, which did not alter C5a core structure, appeared from NMR results to reduce potency by causing a long-distance conformational change centered on residue His-15. Thus, at least three discontinuous regions of the C5a molecule appear to act in concert to achieve full potency.\r"

Our data show that Leu19-Ag is expressed on muscle-specific components of myosegments in repair and thus represents a molecular marker of muscle regeneration.

Also, of 9 patients positive for HBV surface antigen and antibody against HBV e antigen, 2 were positive for HBV DNA by slot-blot analysis and 8 by PCR. Finally, in 8 patients positive for HBV DNA by slot-blot hybridization, but 4 were positive by PCR. We find that analysis by the PCR technique provides a greater than 10(4)-fold increase in sensitivity over the slot-blot hybridization assay. This result represents an important breakthrough in sensitivity because it is now possible to detect as few as three HBV DNA genomes per sample of serum.\r"

  ".W": "Acidic pH within endosomal vesicles of sensitive animal cells triggers a conformational change in diphtheria toxin (DT) that is believed to cause the B chain to insert into the vesicular membrane and the enzymic A chain to be released into the cytosol. In artificial lipid bilayers, DT forms ion-conductive channels under mildly acidic conditions (pH approximately 5). Here we report a related phenomenon in Escherichia coli strains that secrete certain cloned DT-related proteins into their periplasm: the cells are rapidly killed at pH 5 but remain unharmed at pH 7. Expression of full-length DT (an active-site mutant, to comply with the National Institutes of Health recombinant DNA guidelines) causes acid-sensitivity, whereas expression of the A chain alone does not. The killed cells are not lysed, but inner-membrane functions are impaired (membrane potential, active transport, and ion impermeability). We propose that acidification of DT within the periplasm induces its insertion into the inner membrane, lethally damaging the permeability barrier. This discovery provides a potentially important selection procedure for mutations affecting the membrane insertion function of DT. Similar approaches may be useful in studying other proteins that undergo condition-dependent interaction with membranes.\r"

A rat salivation bioassay was used to demonstrate potent effects of NPK at low doses, while effects due to NKA were much weaker at higher doses. The rank order of potency of beta-preprotachykinin-derived peptides on salivation responses was NPK greater than substance P greater than NKA much greater than beta-preprotachykinin-(72-96)-peptide. The time course of the NPK response was longer than that observed with substance P. The responses elicited by NPK were blocked by the tachykinin antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]substance P but not by atropine. In peptide coinfusion studies, NPK strikingly potentiated the salivation responses elicited by substance P. NPK in vitro displayed a 100 times lower potency than substance P in displacing 3H-labeled substance P binding in submandibular gland membranes, a tissue rich in SP-P type (NK-1) receptors. The possible cellular mechanisms by which NPK stimulates salivary gland secretion are discussed. We conclude that NPK and substance P may be cotransmitters derived by posttranslational processing of beta-preprotachykinin.\r"

  ".U": "89098927\r", 
  ".W": "The allosteric control of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, EC 2.1.3.2) of Escherichia coli involves feedback inhibition by both CTP and UTP rather than just CTP alone. It has been known that CTP functions as a heterotropic inhibitor of catalysis; however, the inhibition by CTP alone is incomplete (50-70% at various aspartate concentrations) and there is only a partial occupancy of the allosteric binding sites by CTP at saturating concentrations. The logic of these allosteric characteristics can now be understood in that UTP is a synergistic inhibitor of ATCase in the presence of CTP even though UTP has no independent effect at pH 7.0. When saturating concentrations of CTP are present, the concentration of substrate required for half-maximal activity (S0.5) of the native holoenzyme for aspartate increases from 5 to 11 mM. When CTP and UTP are both present, the aspartate requirement increases further (S0.5 = 17 mM). At aspartate concentrations less than 5 mM, the heterotropic inhibition of ATCase is 90-95% in the presence of both pyrimidine nucleotides. UTP does enhance the binding of CTP to the holoenzyme but the number of tight binding sites does not change (n = 3). The binding of UTP is stabilized in the presence of CTP although its binding characteristics are not as strong as those of CTP. The recent crystallographic studies of Kim et al. [Kim, H.K., Pan, Z., Honzatko, R.B., Ke, H.M. & Lipscomb, W.N. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 853-875] have described a structural asymmetry across the molecular two-fold axis that is consistent with these CTP/UTP interactions. The synergistic inhibition of ATCase by both CTP and UTP provides a satisfying logic for ensuring a balance of endogenous pyrimidine nucleotide pools.\r"

Sequence analysis shows additionally that these putative control elements in the Ren2d gene are interrupted by a 160-base-pair insertion. To document the functions of these elements, we isolated these regions and fused them to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which was linked upstream to a thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (pUTKAT1). The chimeric constructs were transfected into mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 and human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells. At the basal unstimulated condition, Ren1d 5' flanking sequence in the sense orientation inhibited basal CAT expression from the TK promoter of pUTKAT1, whereas the same sequence in the antisense orientation did not. The 5' flanking region of Ren2d had no inhibitory effect on basal CAT expression. These data demonstrate that the negative control element is functional in Ren1d but is nonfunctional in Ren2d, suggesting that the 160-base-pair insertion in Ren2d interferes with the function of the negative control elements. In response to 8-bromo-cAMP, both renin genes increased transcription 3-fold, suggesting a functional cis action of the cAMP responsive element in both genes. These data may be important in the understanding of the regulation of the tissue-specific expression of mouse renin genes.\r"

Our results demonstrate that one or more cellular factors bind to UASCUP1 in a copper-inducible fashion.

The protein has three Ca2+-binding sites, three cysteine residues, and a noncovalently bound chromophore that consists of coelenterazine and molecular oxygen. Light is emitted via an intramolecular reaction in which coelenterazine is oxidized by the bound oxygen. After light emission, aequorin may be regenerated by incubating the protein with coelenterazine, dissolved oxygen, EDTA, and 2-mercaptoethanol. To understand structure-function relationships in this protein, we used the technique of site-specific mutagenesis to replace the three cysteine residues with serine. Six of the seven modified aequorins had reduced luminescence activity, whereas the seventh with all three cysteines replaced by serine had luminescence activity equal to or greater than that of the wild-type aequorin. Further, the time required for the regeneration of the triply substituted aequorin was substantially increased compared to the time required for the regeneration of the wild-type aequorin. The results suggest that cysteine plays an important role in the regeneration of aequorin but not in its catalytic activity.\r"

DNA sequence analysis of the 236-base-pair region separating these genes showed the presence of seven putative met boxes. When this plasmid was used to transform either wild-type E. coli, metE mutant, or metR mutant, MetE enzyme activity increased 5- to 7-fold over wild-type levels. The metR gene was subcloned from pRSE562, and this plasmid, pMRIII, relieved the methionine auxotrophy of a metR mutant after transformation. The metR gene was also cloned into a vector containing the lambda PL promoter, and the MetR protein was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity. This protein, when added to an in vitro DNA-dependent protein synthesis system in which the MetE and/or MetR proteins were synthesized, caused a large increase in the expression of the metE gene but a decrease in the expression of the metR gene. The in vitro expression of both genes was inhibited by the MetJ protein and S-adenosylmethionine in the presence or absence of MetR protein. These results provide evidence that the product of the metR gene is a trans-activator of the expression of the metE gene and that the expression of the metR gene is under autogenous regulation and is repressed by the MetJ protein.\r"

Based on properties common to all tropomyosins, we have purified a protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that resembles tropomyosins from higher cells. The yeast protein remains soluble after heat treatment at 90 degrees C, has an apparent polypeptide molecular weight of 33,000, an isoelectric point of 4.5, a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm, and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 S. It binds F-actin in a Mg2+-dependent, KCl-modulated manner, up to a stoichiometry of about 1 polypeptide per 3.0 actin monomers. In all these properties it is very similar to tropomyosins from higher cells. Antigen-affinity-purified antibodies specifically recognize the Mr 33,000 polypeptide among total yeast proteins and crossreact with bovine brain tropomyosin. In addition, the antibodies specifically crossreact with heat-stable Mr 33,000 polypeptides in extracts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Physarum polycephalum. Our detection of tropomyosin in lower eukaryotes suggests that they might have contractile systems very similar to those found in higher organisms.\r"

  ".U": "89098942\r", 
  ".W": "The overall structure of transfer RNA is optimized for its various functions by a series of unique post-transcriptional nucleotide modifications. Since many of these modifications are conserved from prokaryotes through higher eukaryotes, it has been proposed that most modified nucleotides serve to optimize the ability of the tRNA to accurately interact with other components of the protein synthesizing machinery. When a cloned synthetic Escherichia coli tRNAPhe gene was transfected into a bacterial host that carried a defective phenylalanine tRNA-synthetase gene, tRNAPhe was overexpressed by 11-fold. As a result of this overexpression, an undermodified tRNAPhe species was produced that lacked only N6-(delta 2-isopentenyl)-2-methylthioadenosine (ms2i6A), a hypermodified nucleotide found immediately 3' to the anticodon of all major E. coli tRNAs that read UNN codons. To investigate the role of ms2i6A in E. coli tRNA, we compared the aminoacylation kinetics and in vitro codon-reading properties of the ms2i6A-lacking and normal fully modified tRNAPhe species. The results of these experiments indicate that while ms2i6A is not required for normal aminoacylation of tRNAPhe, its presence stabilizes codon-anticodon interaction and thereby prevents misreading of the genetic code.\r"

  ".U": "89098950\r",

We have now shown that S8 also regulates the synthesis of the first and second gene products (L14 and L24) of the operon by acting at the same mRNA target site--that is, the site located distal to sites coding for L14 and L24--and that mRNA degradation is involved in this retroregulation. It was shown that single base substitutions in the target site, which abolish repression of the synthesis of L5 and L5-distal gene products by S8, also cause derepression of L14-L24 synthesis. Inhibition of L14-L24 synthesis by S8 was also shown by overproducing S8 in trans from a plasmid carrying the S8 gene under lac promoter/operator control. A strain carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in genes for polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II was found upon shift to nonpermissive temperature to show higher differential synthesis rates of L14-L24 (and L5) relative to those of several L5-distal spc operon gene products. We suggest that repression of distal ribosomal protein synthesis by S8 triggers nucleolytic cleavage of spc operon mRNA, followed by mRNA degradation by these 3'- to 5'- exonucleases, which is then responsible for inhibition of L14-L24 synthesis.\r"

To determine the upper and lower size limits of the loop, we constructed PBAD-reporter gene fusion plasmids with various spacings between araI and araO2 and measured their levels of expression. Spacings larger than about 500 base pairs resulted in elimination of detectable repression. No lower limit to spacing was found, suggesting that AraC protein itself possesses significant flexibility and its bending substantially aids formation of small loops. As the spacing between araI and araO2 varied, the activity of PBAD oscillated with an 11.1-base-pair periodicity, implying that the in vivo helical repeat of this DNA is 11.1 base pairs per turn.\r"

Modulation of transcriptional elongation by attenuation within exon 1 of the myc gene is thought to play an important role in determining levels of myc RNA in both normal and tumor cells. We show that the first exon of mouse myc contains specific DNA sequences that may mediate transcriptional attenuation. A 180-nucleotide DNA fragment derived from the 3' end of exon 1 reduced transcriptional elongation by polymerase II when placed within an intron of the human alpha 1-globin gene and assayed by transfection into HeLa cells. A 36-nucleotide sequence that resembles a variety of transcriptional termination signals was located within this myc fragment but was by itself insufficient to cause attenuation when placed within the alpha-globin gene. Modulation of transcriptional elongation through specific DNA sequences within a gene may thus provide a mechanism for regulating its expression.\r"

By a subsequent R-banding, the 6-kb and 2.3-kb fragments were precisely localized to the 18p11.3 band and to the 22q11.2 band, respectively, in agreement with previous results obtained with radioactive probes. The adaptation of fluorescence intensification and digital image processing (frame integration to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and linear contrast stretching) to microscopy makes it possible to detect very weak fluorescent spots on chromosomes. This system allows a high spatial resolution (less than 0.6 micron), even at very low fluorescence levels. The efficiency and the specificity of the hybridization and detection methodology give a direct and precise localization of the short single-copy sequences on human chromosomes.\r"

We have isolated and characterized an effector-independent neurofilament-specific protein kinase from bovine spinal cord that is associated with the NF complex and exhibits a marked substrate specificity for NF-H, the largest subunit of the NF triplet. This kinase activity emerges from a NF-conjugated affinity column coincident with a 67-kDa doublet on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels and has a purity of greater than 90%. The purified enzyme exclusively phosphorylates NF-H tails and is dependent on prior phosphorylation of this molecule. The enzyme is also not autophosphorylated. While the molecular properties and substrate specificities of the NF kinase distinguish it from cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase, and casein kinases I and II, it exhibits certain properties similar to, but different from, the growth-associated histone H1 kinase. The molecular properties and specific sequence requirements of the NF kinase suggest that this enzyme could play a pivotal role in the phosphorylation of NFs in normal and pathological states such as Alzheimer disease, where NFs are hyperphosphorylated.\r"

  ".W": "N-Methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp) and phencyclidine receptors interactively mediate central nervous system processes including psychotomimetic effects of drugs as well as neurodegenerative, cognitive, and developmental events. To elucidate the mechanism of this interaction, effects of N-Me-D-Asp agonists and antagonists and of glycine-like agents upon binding of the radiolabeled phencyclidine receptor ligand [3H]MK-801 were determined in rat brain. Scatchard analysis revealed two discrete components of [3H]MK-801 binding after 4 hr of incubation. Incubation in the presence of L-glutamate led to an increase in apparent densities but not in affinities of both components of [3H]MK-801 binding as well as conversion of sites from apparent low to high affinity. Incubation in the presence of combined D-serine and L-glutamate led to an increase in the apparent density of high-affinity [3H]MK-801 binding compared with incubation in the presence of either L-glutamate or D-serine alone. These data support a model in which phencyclidine receptor ligands bind differentially to closed as well as open conformations of the N-Me-D-Asp receptor complex and in which glycine-like agents permit or factilitate agonist-induced conversion of N-Me-D-Asp receptors from closed to open conformations.\r"

We prepared affinity-purified antibody, P2, against an extracytoplasmic APP site and applied it, along with monoclonal antibodies to the beta-peptide, or A4 region, in conjunction with selective cytochemical staining methods, to control and AD tissues. The following was noted: (i) in contrast to A4 epitopes, which are easily demonstrable primarily in extracellular senile plaques of AD patients, the extracytoplasmic P2 antigen was found in association with neurons, glia, and blood vessels in both normal and AD prefrontal cortex; (ii) a subset of senile plaques contained both A4 and P2 antigens; (iii) in some instances, P2 antigen occurred as an extracellular deposit in the absence of A4; (iv) the P2 antigen, but not A4, was also associated with corpora amylacea. In addition to identifying the unique cellular distribution of the APP extracytoplasmic antigen, the results support the view that a segment of this domain undergoes processing and deposition at extracellular sites, including a subset of senile plaques.\r"

In this article, the existing literature on lifting is reviewed and mechanisms of back support during lifting are described. These mechanisms include the intra-abdominal pressure mechanism, the thoracolumbar fascia mechanism, and combinations of these mechanisms with the use of the erector spinae, multifidus, and psoas muscles. Physical therapists are often responsible for teaching patients and workers \"proper\" lifting techniques; however, controversy exists concerning the proper lift. Although lifting with the lower back in flexion and lifting in extension have been proposed, there are indications for each depending on individual circumstances. Lifting instructions for workers without low back injuries should be distinguished from instructions for patients with low back pain. General rules for lifting include: plan the lift, avoid twisting, keep the load close to the body, and bend at the knees.\r"

A new mastopexy technique is described which appears to offer long-term correction. After conservative resection of excess skin, the breast parenchyma is elevated from the chest wall, and redundant caudal deepithelialized breast tissue is divided into two equal (or unequal) superiorly based pedicles. These are criss-crossed (as in folding of arms), overlapped, and secured to the pectoral fascia in a position cephalad to the nipple-areolar complex. This technique, dual-pedicle dermoparenchymal mastopexy (DPM), forms a cone of the breast tissue and provides a \"cradle\" of support. It permits insertion of a prosthesis if needed. Based, in part, on concepts of traditional and more recently described pedicled breast reductions, it enjoys the advantage of preserving skin attachment to underlying unresected breast parenchyma. In addition, it repositions ptotically displaced breast parenchyma into a cephalad position and fixes it (the \"pexy\") to the chest wall. A 10-year experience is presented with representative cases to illustrate the basic mastopexy and its use with augmentation or reduction.\r"

These advances are due largely to greater understanding of the immune response, the development of potent immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporin A), and improved surgical techniques. Thus more of these patients may require surgical procedures related or unrelated to their original operation, and the plastic surgeon, among other specialists, should be aware of the special problems of the immunocompromised transplant recipient who needs to undergo reconstructive surgery. We report our experience with 15 kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients who required reconstructive surgery for a variety of conditions. The combined team approach by reconstructive and transplant surgeons is described, as well as the perioperative drug protocol and the special problems that immunosuppressed transplant recipients present. We conclude that these patients can successfully undergo major reconstructive procedures as long as the plastic surgeon not only performs technically flawless surgery, but also familiarizes himself or herself with the special problems of the immunosuppressed host, including the ever-present risk of sepsis and delayed and impaired wound healing, the potential for acute Addisonian crisis, and the possibility of multiple complicating comorbid conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Free fat graft autotransplantation for soft-tissue replacement has been a neglected subject in recent years. In a review of the literature, investigations of the various uses of free fat autotransplantation in animals and humans provide an understanding of the problems associated with the use of fat as a free graft. Results of free fat autotransplantation were found to be quite unpredictable, with wide variations in the resulting bulk of the graft. Microscopic studies of this behavior led to controversy as to whether the graft ultimately was made of surviving graft adipocytes (cell survival theory) or host adipocytes (host replacement theory). Studies revealed a \"fibroblast-like\" mesenchymal cell within adipose tissue that was believed to be an immature adipocyte precursor or preadipocyte. Further characterization of the preadipocyte and its complete differentiation was accomplished using tissue-culture techniques. These investigations provide evidence of the dynamic nature of adipose tissue that strongly supports the cell survival theory and gives explanation to the unpredictable behavior of free fat autografts. Many conditions treated by plastic surgeons require soft-tissue augmentation. Autogenous adipose tissue is the most appropriate and natural replacement material. With new culturing techniques, preadipocytes in a single cell suspension may provide an injectable soft-tissue replacement. This subject appears ripe for investigation.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) was performed in three cases, ultrasound (US) in four cases, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in one case. Twenty-eight cases reported in the literature are reviewed for comparison. CM shows a clear predilection for the surfaces of the pelvic viscera but is seen in other areas of the peritoneum and retroperitoneum. The neoplasm was intraperitoneal in three cases and primarily retroperitoneal in the other two cases. In all CT and US studies performed, a single large, multilocular cystic mass was demonstrated. MR imaging, performed in one case, showed that the lesion had signal characteristics typical of a watery collection low in solute concentration. It is concluded that CM of the peritoneum has a nonspecific multilocular cystic appearance on images, which does not permit it to be differentiated from other cystic lesions.\r"

Other features including atrial anastomosis, high main pulmonary artery segment, remnant superior vena cava, and cardiac reorientation were also seen. Accurate interpretation of adenopathy, mediastinal abscess, and pericardial effusion will be enhanced in these patients through a better understanding of the cardiovascular-pericardial complex, which is afforded by CT.\r"

Twelve palpable pulsatile masses were imaged. Diagnoses were confirmed at angiography (n = 11), computed tomography (n = 7), aspiration biopsy (n = 5), and operative intervention (n = 6). A swirling pattern of blood flow was seen in six of seven cases of pseudoaneurysm. Lack of flow signals was noted in four of the five collections representing hematoma (n = 2) or infection (n = 2). The seventh case was later shown to be an infected, thrombosed pseudoaneurysm. The single false-positive diagnosis was made early in the series when the flow signals detected were due to transmitted arterial pulsations. The authors conclude that color Doppler flow imaging is useful in the differential diagnosis of pulsatile masses associated with prosthetic grafts. Prosthetic graft pseudoaneurysms have a specific appearance of swirling blood flow arising from a wide neck and are distinguishable from traumatic or iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms of the native vascular tree.\r"

Findings of the 43 RCTs judged to be of the highest quality suggest that the efficacy of LOM in imaging is equal or superior to that of HOM for all routes of administration. Heat sensation occurred less often with LOM for all routes and pain occurred less often with LOM for intraarterial routes. No differences were seen in nephrotoxicity or in frequency of nausea, vomiting, urticaria, bronchospasm, laboratory test abnormalities, or neurologic events. Greater cardiovascular changes were seen with HOM, including increased or decreased heart rate, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, decreased systolic pressure, and QT prolongation, depending on route of administration. To demonstrate whether a reduction in clinically significant adverse outcomes truly occurs with LOM, trials will need to enlist larger numbers of patients and employ appropriate outcome measures. Future trials should stratify patients according to their risk of adverse reactions to provide better information about benefits of LOM in low- versus high-risk patients.\r"

The authors report the results of stereotaxic localization, combined with fine-needle aspiration and cytologic study, performed in 528 cases. Clinically occult breast lesions were localized precisely (within 2 mm 96% of the time), sampled by means of a 23-gauge needle, and marked with either methylene blue or a hookwire for subsequent open excisional biopsy. The results indicate a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 91%, and accuracy of 92% for the fine-needle aspiration procedure. This technique offers a significantly improved preoperative method of diagnosing small breast lesions with minimal pain, no complications, reduced cost, and no disfigurement or scar interfering with subsequent mammographic follow-up.\r"

Typically, the thymus was located anterior to the great vessels and extended down to the upper portion of the heart (in one infant, to the diaphragm). It extended up into the lower cervical area in five infants. The great vessels--including the superior vena cava, aorta, and the pulmonary artery--were well imaged through the thymus. In six infants the thymus encircled the left innominate vein. The echogenicity of the thymus was homogeneous, similar to that of the liver and spleen. The intensity of thymic echogenicity was less than that of the liver, spleen, and thyroid gland. This study demonstrates that the thymus has a characteristic sonographic appearance and can be easily identified.\r"

Seventeen subjects underwent duplex sonography: nine children after liver transplantation, two children with right upper quadrant neuroblastoma, and six healthy control subjects. In six children the spectrum obtained from the IVC bore a strong resemblance to the unidirectional, low-velocity, continuous-flow pattern associated with the portal vein; these children included two children with biliary atresia and cirrhosis, two liver transplant recipients, and two children with IVC compression by neoplasm. In healthy children and adults, a pseudoportal Doppler signal in the IVC can be generated by subcostal right upper quadrant compression. The pseudoportal IVC appears to be a sign of partial IVC obstruction. Knowledge of this potential pitfall and meticulous morphologic imaging can help prevent mistaking the IVC for a patent portal vein.\r"

The authors sought the source of this central echo with ultrasound (US) and histoanatomic study of both fresh and fixed cadaver spinal cords. Correlative transverse sections of the spinal cord were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Luxol fast blue for cells and myelin and with Holzer stain for glial fibrils. The central echo complex is produced by the interface between the myelinated ventral white commissure and the central end of the anterior median fissure. Variations in the shape of the central complex seem to reflect varying degrees of flaring of the central end of the anterior median fissure. The inconstant residual central canal and islands of residual ependymal cells are clearly not the source of the central echo complex.\r"

Selective catheterization of the carotid artery was possible in 95% of patients, with definitive examinations of both extra- and intracranial circulation obtained in 95%-100% of all patients. Vessel opacification was very good to excellent, and the technique was inherently free from artifact caused by vessel overlap or involuntary motion. There were 25 complications, of which 20 were local in nature. Iodine load per case was extremely low, averaging 4.2-7.0 g. Selective carotid and vertebral catheterizations by the brachial route proved to be as safe as intravenous DSA and aortic arch intraarterial DSA with less contrast material load and superior images.\r"

In addition, scans of paired carotid arteries in patients with stroke involving only one cerebral hemisphere were compared to determine whether the incriminated side demonstrated a greater degree of stenosis than the asymptomatic side. The duplex US findings demonstrated a positive correlation between stenosis and hemispheric stroke. However, only 20% of carotid arteries ipsilateral to hemispheric stroke showed a reduction in diameter greater than 70%, compared with 5% of asymptomatic vessels. A minimal difference was demonstrated between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups with respect to lesser degrees of stenosis. In paired carotid arteries, the degree of stenosis of the symptomatic vessel exceeded that of the asymptomatic vessel in only 43% of cases. These results suggest that the prevalence of severe carotid stenosis in stroke patients has been previously overestimated. The findings also emphasize the need for further investigation of other plaque-related risk factors that may enhance stroke prevention through improved selection of surgical or medical therapy. Factors currently under investigation include plaque ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque echogenicity, and the effects of sequential stenoses.\r"

Fifty-one cancers (diagnosed and evaluated by means of US-guided biopsy or evaluated by means of radical prostatectomy) were studied. There were 30 hypoechoic, ten echogenically mixed, six isoechoic, and five subtly hyperechoic cancers. The degree of stromal fibrosis was minimal in well-differentiated cancers and increased in poorly differentiated cancers. In addition, the more hypoechoic lesions were, in general, the better-differentiated cancers and had less fibrosis. There was a tendency for the isoechoic cancers and those with subtly hyperechoic areas to more often have poor cellular differentiation and a greater degree of stromal fibrosis, but considerable overlap among histologic types was seen.\r"

Overall, the endovaginal study was judged superior in 65 cases (60.2%), equal in 39 (36.1%), and inferior in four (3.7%).

The variants are enzymically active and are practically indistinguishable from the original enzyme by several structural and spectroscopic criteria, despite the creation of new termini and the cleavage of a surface loop. This novel genetic approach should be useful for protein folding studies both in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Because of this limitation, a novel technique, anchored polymerase chain reaction (A-PCR), was devised that requires sequence specificity only on the 3' end of the target fragment. It was used to analyze TCR delta chain mRNA's from human peripheral blood gamma delta T cells. Most of these cells had a V delta gene segment not previously described (V delta 3), and the delta chain junctional sequences formed a discrete subpopulation compared with those previously reported.\r"

Basic fibroblast growth factor, which is a potent angiogenic factor, and interleukin-1 messenger RNAs are expressed at very high levels and seem to account for a large proportion of the activities, since their corresponding proteins are released in biologically active form into the culture media where they induce autocrine and paracrine growth effects.\r"

MK-801, phencyclidine, and ketamine, noncompetitive antagonists of one subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, provided substantial protection against neurotoxicity produced by methamphetamine but not that produced by MPTP. These findings indicate that excitatory amino acids play an important role in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage induced by methamphetamine.\r"

The need to produce transgenic chickens in the absence of replicating virus prompted development of a new method of gene transfer into the chicken. Microinjection of the replication-defective reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) vector ME111 beneath unincubated chicken embryo blastoderms results in infection of germline stem cells. This vector contains genetic information exogenous to the chicken genome, including both the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene and the Tn5 neomycin phosphotransferase gene. About 8 percent of male birds hatched from injected embryos contained vector DNA in their semen. All four positive males tested passed vector sequences onto their progeny. Analysis of G1 offspring showed that gonads of G0 male birds were mosaic with respect to insertion of vector provirus. Thus, primordial germ cells present in the unincubated chicken embryo blastoderm are susceptible to infection by defective REV vectors.\r"

In an F2 population derived from crossing S and R rats, the renin RFLP cosegregated with blood pressure. One dose of the S-rat renin allele was associated with an increment in blood pressure of approximately 10 mmHg, and two doses of this allele increased blood pressure approximately 20 mmHg.

We attempted to assess whether this action had an adverse effect medically and financially on those concerned. A computer randomized sample of 351 patients (9%) was studied by personal interview and questionnaire. Information obtained focused on certain events that occurred 18 months before and after the program ceased. Measurements used to determine medical impact were number of hospitalizations, emergency room and physician visits, changes in weight and glucose levels, and episodes of ketoacidosis. Financial impact was measured by cost of hospitalization and physician visits. Our results revealed no significant changes in any of the medical parameters studied except for fasting serum glucose levels above 300 mg/dl, which occurred less frequently after the free insulin program was discontinued. There were fewer hospitalizations, more visits to physicians, and no change in number of emergency room visits after discontinuance of the free program. The overall cost saving was estimated to be +883,558 for the 18-month study period, in addition to the +550,000 the plan had been costing the state.\r"

When we reviewed the records of 406 patients admitted to the hospital because of gastrointestinal blood loss, we found nine patients who had AVMs of the small intestine. We have developed an algorithm that presents a rational diagnostic approach to patients with hemorrhage from the small intestine. Single contrast barium roentgenograms were not helpful in this series. Endoscopy is not helpful unless the scope can be passed to the area of involvement. Arteriography is the most helpful diagnostic maneuver and should be considered early in the work-up for suspected intestinal AVMs. In addition, arteriography can be useful in localizing the precise area of bleeding so that resection can be limited to the involved areas.\r"

  ".W": "The first legislated orthodox medical school within Alabama was founded in Mobile in 1859, a legacy of Dr. Josiah Clark Nott. That it developed later than other Southern medical schools has been attributed to multiple factors, among them rural isolation, restricted communication, limited transportation, sparse population, cultural deprivation, and climatologic enervation. The rationale for a medical school within Alabama was also multifactorial: to supply physicians to rural Alabama, to reverse the economic and cultural drain among Alabamians that out-of-state education implied, and to educate medical students regarding the unique health care requirements of a predominantly rural Alabama populace. A medical school building was constructed east of the Mobile City Hospital, and was equipped with an elegant collection of anatomic models acquired by Nott during his travels in western Europe in 1859. After only two sessions, however, the War Between the States (1861 to 1865) forced the medical school to close, as faculty and students joined the Confederate forces. In 1868, with the continued involvement of Dr. W. H. Anderson as Dean, the institution was reopened. During the succeeding 52 years of its existence, the financially strapped medical school attempted to cope with evolving medical technologies and educational philosophies. Despite the commitment of the administrators and faculty, sociopolitical factors and insufficient economic support militated against the school's continued existence. Nott has been characterized as a physician, anatomist, anthropologist, and ethnologist. His opinions as revealed in his writings were controversial because they addressed sociopolitical and racial issues. Nevertheless, his commitment to the Medical College of Alabama in Mobile was unstinting, and he provided the major leadership role in its establishment.\r"

A total of 38 patients survived and 57 died with or without medical treatment. Thirteen patients survived and five died after ligation of the hepatic artery. Five patients survived and three died after embolization of the hepatic artery. (formula; see text) Of 119 patients with MHH, 81 (68 per cent) had congestive heart failure; 40 survived and 41 died. Of 56 patients with localized hepatic angiomas, 19 had congestive heart failure. Only two of the patients died of heart failure. Fifty localized hepatic angiomas in infancy that were treated with local resection or lobectomy were reviewed. Forty-six patients survived and four died of hemorrhage. Four patients survived and two died with or without medical treatment. Plans for management of multiple hepatic hemangioendotheliomas and localized hepatic angiomas in infancy were proposed.\r"

None of the patients had had previous surgical treatment of the parathyroid or thyroid glands. All of the patients underwent systematic bilateral exploration of the neck. All of the patients were successfully explored and 41 abnormal parathyroid glands were identified. Five patients had two adenomas. In six instances, adenomas were identified in ectopic anatomic sites. The sensitivity of correctly localizing the abnormal glands with these techniques was 49 per cent for the Tl-201/Tc-99m scintigraphy, 34 per cent for ultrasonography and 41 per cent for CT scanning. The Tl-201/Tc-99m scintigrams detected two of the six ectopically located adenomas, CT detected one, while ultrasound detected none. The five patients with multiple adenomas were not accurately identified as having multiple gland enlargement by any of these studies. Therefore, preoperative localization studies with these three techniques did not provide reliable information for initial bilateral exploration of the neck.\r"

This initial report was followed by illustration of this phenomenon in Rokitanski's Book of Pathologic Anatomy in 1841 and by Ryle's delineation of an aortocaval fistula on a pathologic specimen placed in Guy's Hospital Museum in 1892. The first series of aortocaval fistulas, cited by Rudolf Matas in 1909, consisted of a collection of 20 cases gathered by Boinet 10 years earlier. Several later reports, including those by Reid in 1925 and by Lehman in 1938, failed to add any additional cases. It was not until 1955 that Boffi presented an additional six patients who had this disorder, none of whom survived. Since that time, more than 100 cases of spontaneous aortocaval fistulas have been documented. This increasing experience has resulted in improved understanding and surgical treatment of these large-vessel arteriovenous communications. Nevertheless, lack of awareness and failure of recognition of this problem continue to impede its successful management. In this review we present two additional illustrative cases, summarize the clinical and pathophysiologic features of aortocaval fistulas, and outline present approaches to treatment.\r"

Endometriosis may also occur in extrapelvic sites and cause unusual symptoms and diagnostic dilemmas. Endometriosis has been described in the inguinal region, and this is illustrated in the first case history. The tender inguinal masses often fluctuate with the menstrual cycle but the condition initially may be confused with an inguinal hernia. Treatment is surgical. Abdominal wall scar endometriosis, seen in the second case, has been described in patients after a wide variety of gynecologic procedures. This also is initially noted as a tender mass, usually fluctuating with menstruation, and is often confused with an incisional hernia. Again, surgery is the treatment of choice. Pathologic features of endometriosis are constant, regardless of location. Microscopically, endometrial glands and stroma, fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and old hemorrhage are seen. Familiarity with the unusual types of endometriosis is important to the general surgeon.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of insulin on glucose utilization were investigated in seven nonobese patients before and 24 hours after elective cholecystectomy. Surgery was followed by a significant increase in the circulating levels of glucose and insulin. The hypoglycemic action of insulin was reduced by one third (p less than 0.01) after surgery. In isolated fat cells after surgery there was a significant overall reduction of 35% to 50% of the effects of insulin on 3-0-methylglucose transport and lipogenesis at 1 mumol/L of glucose (where hexose transport is rate-limiting for insulin action). However, there was no change in insulin sensitivity in these cells. The effects of insulin on lipogenesis in adipocytes incubated with 100 mumol/L of glucose (where glucose metabolism is rate-limiting for insulin action) and adipocyte insulin receptor binding were not influenced by surgery. Insulin action in vivo and in vitro was not altered in five nonoperated control subjects 24 hours after they were given the same type of nutritional support as the cholecystectomy patients postoperatively. It was concluded that an elective moderate surgical trauma induces a rapid and marked insulin resistance that is not the result of postoperative nutritional restriction and involves a postreceptor binding alteration of glucose transport.\r"

  ".W": "Prelining graft material with autologous functioning endothelial cells might be one of the ultimate requirements to obtain a biocompatible surface. Accordingly, endothelial cells from stripped varicose veins were enzymatically harvested and grown on a fibronectin matrix. Proliferation was investigated in defined medium supplemented with various concentrations of endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) (25, up to 150 micrograms/ml) and heparin (10(-8), up to 10(-5)mol/L): optimal growth required both 150 micrograms/ml of ECGS and 10(-5)mol/L heparin. Under these conditions, cell culture achieved cell densities at a confluence of 1.2 +/- 1.1 10(5) cells/cm2 with a doubling time of 1 day. During subcultivation cultured cells consistently exhibited characteristic cobblestone morphology and immunofluorescent staining for factor VIII-related antigen, whereas prostacyclin production determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha reached 21.1 +/- 1.2 ng/10(6) cells after 15-minute stimulation with 1 U/ml of thrombin. Heparin-containing culture medium-endothelial cell interactions were particularly studied, and with iodine 125-heparin, binding was demonstrated with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.36 +/- 0.04 mumol/L. A cold storage technique at -80 degrees C was sought, and freezed cells were used to coat in vitro polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Protein-treated material allowed cell attachment and growth to a confluent monolayer as assayed by light and scanning electron microscopy. These data validate the feasibility of prelining grafts in vitro with autologous functioning endothelial cells. This approach may be useful in improving the performance of small-caliber vascular grafts according to prostacyclin production and surface-bound heparin of these cells.\r"

  ".W": "For 18 patients after total pancreatectomy, serial determinations of plasma immunoreactive insulin bound with insulin antibody (binding IRI) were performed to ascertain the relationship between insulin antibody formation and diabetic stability. As a result, seven patients treated with human DNA insulin experienced neither unstable diabetic control (UDC) nor binding IRI elevation. On the other hand, six (58%) of 11 patients treated with beef and porcine insulins began to experience UDC with elevation of binding IRI. For these six patients, the binding IRI level was as low as 242 +/- 100 microU/ml at the onset of UDC and continued to increase (maximum binding IRI, 2048 +/- 1707 microU/ml) without spontaneous recovery from UDC. However, three patients recovered from UDC by the transfer to human DNA insulin, with a small decrease in binding IRI (470 to 4400 microU/ml) at the end of UDC. An equilibrium binding assay and the kinetic analysis of insulin antibodies showed that high-affinity antibody capacity (Ab1) for beef insulin was 28 +/- 6 ng/ml immediately before UDC, 306 +/- 120 ng/ml (115 to 578 ng/ml) during UDC, and 28 +/- 12 ng/ml immediately after UDC. Low-affinity antibody capacity was not correlated with diabetic stability. Therefore, in the totally pancreatectomized patients, it was concluded (1) that Ab1 was associated with the UDC onset or the recovery and (2) that UDC developed with far lower levels of Ab1, in contrast with patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. This is a reason why serial determination of insulin antibody, especially Ab1, is necessary for control of diabetes after total pancreatectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The distal splenorenal shunt operation was specifically designed to preserve portal flow and maintain elevated portal pressure. However, although this goal is met in the immediate postoperative period, flow decreases over time, and in as many as 75% of alcoholic patients, portal flow is lost in the first year. Various explanations have been offered for this observation, and modifications of the original operation have been proposed (splenopancreatic disconnection). Although other portacaval shunts have been successfully modeled as electrical circuits, this approach has never been described for the distal splenorenal shunt. In this study we developed a computer program that modeled the distal splenorenal shunt as an electrical circuit. We performed an analysis to determine the sensitivity of portal flow to changes in each resistance element and then performed a series of simulation experiments to critically examine the various explanations offered for the gradual changes in hepatic hemodynamics. We found that portal flow was most sensitive to resistance in the renal vein followed by resistance in the anastomosis. The simulation experiments suggested a new alternative to splenopancreatic disconnection--restricting the ability of the splenic vein, anastomosis, or renal vein to dilate. Additional clinical studies will be needed to test these predictions.\r"

  ".W": "To develop a simple, relatively noninvasive small-animal model of reversible regional cerebral ischemia, we tested various methods of inducing infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) by extracranial vascular occlusion in rats. In preliminary studies, 60 rats were anesthetized with ketamine and different combinations of vessels were occluded; blood pressure and arterial blood gases were monitored. Neurologic deficit, mortality rate, gross pathology, and in some instances, electroencephalogram and histochemical staining results were evaluated in all surviving rats. The principal procedure consisted of introducing a 4-0 nylon intraluminal suture into the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) and advancing it intracranially to block blood flow into the MCA; collateral blood flow was reduced by interrupting all branches of the external carotid artery (ECA) and all extracranial branches of the ICA. In some groups of rats, bilateral vertebral or contralateral carotid artery occlusion was also performed. India ink perfusion studies in 20 rats documented blockage of MCA blood flow in 14 rats subjected to permanent occlusion and the restoration of blood flow to the MCA territory in six rats after withdrawal of the suture from the ICA. The best method of MCA occlusion was then selected for further confirmatory studies, including histologic examination, in five additional groups of rats anesthetized with halothane. Seven of eight rats that underwent permanent occlusion of the MCA had resolving moderately severe neurologic deficits (Grade 2 of 4) and unilateral infarcts averaging 37.6 +/- 5.5% of the coronal sectional area at 72 hours after the onset of occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure includes the separation of the bone marrow aspirates by concentrating and collecting interface buffy coat cells. A mononuclear white cell-enriched fraction is then obtained with ficoll-hypaque in the blood cell processor. Finally, the bone marrow white cells are washed to remove the ficoll-hypaque and the contaminating plasma. The entire procedure is carried out in a closed system. The automated method of isolating mononuclear cells proved superior to the manual method in both the recovery of cells and the time needed to process the marrow. Also, the risk of microbial contamination is substantially reduced. When marrow white cells processed by this method and cryopreserved were transfused subsequently into patients who had previously undergone high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy, engraftment, as indicated by a rise in the absolute granulocyte count of greater than 1000 per mm3, occurred within 20 days. This semiautomated technique provides a convenient, rapid, and reliable method for processing and preparing large numbers of viable marrow cells.\r"

  ".W": "To prevent the transmission of human T-lymphotropic virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) during blood transfusion, a program was implemented to screen donors for antibodies to the virus, using a newly developed, passive agglutination (PA) method. During the period April 1986 to March 1987, 675 recipients of donor blood in whom the antibody to HTLV-1 was not present before transfusion were followed for at least 50 days after transfusion. One of these 675 seroconverted despite the transfusion of screened blood, but this seroconversion rate (0.15%) represents a marked decrease from the rate of 8.3 percent prevalent before donor screening began. The rate in the Fukuoka area of donors seropositive for anti-HTLV-1 is 5.34 percent, as detected by the PA method and 1.80 percent, as assessed by the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) technique, with PA-positive but IF-negative blood units thus accounting for 3.5 percent (5.34-1.80) of the total blood donated. The seroconversion rate among recipients transfused with blood screened by IF (at Kyushu University Hospital only) from 1981 to 1985 was 0.41 percent, which was not significantly different from the rate of 0.15 percent observed after PA screening. The discrepancy between PA and IF in the rate of seropositivity was due, in part, to the higher sensitivity of PA in detecting anti-HTLV-1. It is proposed that all donor blood in areas where HTLV-1 is endemic be screened by PA before transfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The form was completed by all donors during a 12 month period beginning in September, 1985. 188,824 units of blood were collected from 123,608 donors. On the first donation occasion 901 donors (0.73%) laboratory (LAB) designated, 224 (0.18%) did not complete the form correctly, and the remaining 122,483 transfusion (TRAN) designated. A greater proportion of LAB donors were men, under the age of 30 and had not donated in the previous two years than TRAN designated donors. Confirmed reactive anti-HIV, Western blot positive (WB+) results were greater in LAB than TRAN donors (1.664% vs 0.014%) on the first donation occasion. There were 43,982 donors who returned to donate on at least one other occasion. Of these, 43,778 designated TRAN initially, and only 217 (0.49%) changed their designation to LAB on any subsequent donation event. In contrast, of the 204 donors who designated LAB initially, 134 (65.6%) changed to TRAN on at least one other occasion. A variety of designation combinations from LAB to TRAN and back to LAB occurred. Thus, donors who initially LAB designated were more likely to change their designation on at least one other occasion than those who initially designated for TRAN. Of two donors who became anti-HIV WB positive on the second donation, one of these LAB designated on both occasions, was negative for anti-HIV by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA-) on the first donation but converted to EIA+, WB+ on the second.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After implementation of a \"radiation awareness program\" radiation exposure was calculated in 128 cases (matched for body weight and stone burden) and average exposure was 9.5 R (from 0.9 to 33.4 R) with a reduction of 20, 37, 33, and 62 percent for each group, respectively. Radiation exposure reduction was primarily due to a reduction in the number of radiographic \"snapshots\" taken as a result of preferential use of special-mode fluoroscopic \"stills.\"\r"

In all but 1 case yolk sac tumor (YST) was the only histologic type that reacted for AFP (AFP+) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) were the only histologic type that reacted for HCG (HCG+). Among 5 cases with normalization of the serum AFP before surgery, 3 were associated with YST-/AFP-, 1 with YST+/AFP+, and 1 with YST+/AFP- metastases; and among 4 cases with normalization of the serum HCG all were associated with STB-/HCG- metastases. Among 3 cases with persistent elevation of the serum AFP, 1 was associated with YST+/AFP+, 1 with YST+/AFP-, and 1 with YST-/AFP- metastases; and of 2 cases with persistent elevation of the serum HCG, 1 was associated with STB-/HCG- and 1 with STB+/HCG+ metastases. These data suggest that marker normalization in the face of persistent tumor results primarily from eradication of YST and STB, but also from treatment-induced inhibition of AFP and HCG synthesis or secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the cholangiographic appearance of intrahepatic bile ducts in 56 liver transplants and correlated the findings with biopsy evidence of acute rejection and other histologic diagnoses. Mild to moderate narrowing, stretching, separation, and poor filling of the bile ducts were common. Narrowing was present in 69 (92%) of 75 studies and was at least moderate in degree in 14 (19%). Duct separation was seen on 39 (58%) of 67 cholangiograms and was usually mild but was more pronounced in 10 (15%). In 22 (25%) of 89 studies, 10 or fewer branch ducts were filled. Cholangiographic abnormalities were more marked in patients with biopsy diagnoses of moderate-severe and partially treated acute rejection than with findings of mild rejection or nonspecific histology. Portal tract cellular infiltration and edema, liver swelling and, possibly, loss of small bile ducts correlated with the radiologic changes. However, the severity of the radiographic changes varied in all histologic categories. Acute rejection contributes to intrahepatic duct narrowing, separation, and poor filling on cholangiography in liver transplants, but the cause of the changes is probably multifactorial. Cholangiography is limited as a test for rejection and other hepatic parenchymal abnormalities in individual patients, but it may provide evidence supporting the need for liver biopsy in the evaluation of hepatic dysfunction after transplantation.\r"

These areas appear as low-density rims that surround or parallel the portal vein and its intrahepatic branches as well as the immediate subhepatic portal area. In order to determine the value of periportal low attenuation as an indicator of rejection, we reviewed the CT scans of 37 liver transplant patients with biopsy evidence of either acute rejection (12 patients) or nonspecific change without rejection (25 patients). Low-attenuation areas around peripheral portal branches were identified in six of 12 patients with rejection and in four of 25 patients with nonspecific change (sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 84%; accuracy, 73%). The correlation between peripheral periportal low attenuation and rejection was statistically significant (p less than .05). Periportal low attenuation in a central location was seen in eight of 12 patients with acute rejection and in 14 of 25 patients with nonspecific change (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 44%; accuracy, 51%). The correlation was not statistically significant. Low-attenuation areas were evident on scans obtained either with or without IV contrast enhancement. Periportal low-attenuation areas are commonly seen on CT scans of liver transplants. Peripheral areas correlate with acute rejection, but other factors probably contribute to their occurrence. Central areas do not correlate with acute rejection. Low sensitivity and relatively low accuracy limit the usefulness of peripheral periportal low attenuation as a sign of acute liver allograft rejection.\r"

The reported prevalence of this sign is more than 95% in patients with acute cholecystitis. In this series of 18 patients with pathologically proved gangrenous cholecystitis, the sonographic Murphy sign was positive in only six (33%). Clinical examination showed a positive Murphy sign in eight patients (44%), diffuse abdominal pain in nine patients (50%), and no pain in one patient (6%). Other sonographic findings included pericholecystic fluid (10), thickening of the gallbladder wall (10), and a dilated gallbladder (five). Our experience suggests that the absence of the Murphy sign increases the possibility of gangrenous cholecystitis in patients with abdominal pain and sonographic findings of cholecystitis.\r"

Intratesticular arteries and testicular capsular arteries were imaged in all 30 cases. Waveforms from these vessels were similar and consistently showed a low-impedance pattern with high levels of diastolic flow. This reflects the low vascular resistance of the testis. Supratesticular arteries were also identified in all 30 cases. In addition to the low-impedance-type waveforms from the testicular artery, waveforms obtained in the supratesticular region also originated from the deferential and/or cremasteric arteries. This resulted in some waveforms with high-impedance patterns, reflecting the high vascular resistance of the epididymis and peritesticular tissues. We believe that color Doppler ultrasound is capable of reliably showing the normal testicular arterial anatomy by imaging intraarterial blood flow. Knowledge of the normal color Doppler appearance and waveform characteristics of the testicular artery should aid in diagnosing scrotal conditions that alter blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), a primary renal neoplasm containing primitive blastema and embryonic glomerulotubular structures, is seen rarely in adults. To identify clinical and radiologic criteria for preoperative diagnosis of adult Wilms tumor, we studied 29 cases reported in the literature from 1975 to 1987 (all patients were 15 years old or older) and four newly diagnosed cases. The mean age of patients was 30 years; 80% were less than 35 years old. Each patient presented with a large, rapidly growing, abdominal mass (average duration of symptoms, less than 2 months), had no constitutional symptoms (e.g., weight loss, fever), and otherwise were healthy (80%). Twenty-six patients had IV or retrograde pyelograms. Twenty-three showed a nonspecific mass effect. In seven (78%) of nine patients, abdominal CT scans showed a large, inhomogeneous mass with large areas of low density and increased enhancement of the compressed remaining normal renal parenchyma, which resembled a pseudocapsule. In five (63%) of eight patients, sonograms showed a complex mass with large cystic components. In 18 (82%) of 22 patients, arteriograms showed a hypovascular mass with fine wavy or zigzag (creeping-vine) neovascularity. We conclude that a rapidly growing renal mass in a young patient (less than 35 years old) that is shown to be complex and cystic by CT or sonography and that is hypovascular with fine, wavy neovascularity on arteriography is suggestive of adult Wilms tumor (75-80%). An awareness of this constellation of findings may be helpful in diagnosing this unusual tumor before surgery.\r"

Occlusive and nonocclusive femoral and popliteal thrombi were detected in 200 studies (42%). In phase 1 of the study (240 examinations), peripheral augmentation with the use of periodic calf compression was required to show color flow throughout the femoropopliteal venous segment. In phase 2 (235 examinations), with a software upgrade to enhance detectability of slow flow, spontaneous flow could be appreciated in the normal, partly thrombosed, and recanalized femoral popliteal veins without augmentation. Augmentation was often necessary to view tibioperoneal veins. Of the total study group, conventional venography was performed for correlation in 47 patients. In the other patients, clinicians relied on the color Doppler test for the definitive diagnosis of the presence or absence of femoral popliteal venous thrombosis and treated these patients on the basis of the color Doppler test result. In the femoral veins, color Doppler studies and venography agreed in all 12 positive and 35 negative cases. In the popliteal veins, there was agreement in five isolated popliteal thromboses and in 10 femoral popliteal thromboses; there were two false-negative color Doppler studies of isolated popliteal thromboses. In four patients, Doppler studies detected nonocclusive thrombus not evident on venography. Color Doppler imaging is easy to perform and does not require augmentation to view color flow in the femoropopliteal venous segment. Eccentric thrombus and partially canalized thrombus can be shown. Initial experience suggests color Doppler imaging may be useful in the detection of tibioperoneal venous thrombosis.\r"

Five patients with confirmed hepatic venoocclusive disease were imaged. All five underwent duplex Doppler examinations; three were also evaluated with color-flow Doppler. The hepatic vasculature was examined in all five patients; decompressive mesoatrial shunts were present and were evaluated in four of the five patients. Color-flow Doppler precisely defined intrahepatic, portal, and inferior vena caval circulatory dynamics. Correlation with angiography was excellent. In the two patients in whom hepatic vasculature was evaluated with duplex Doppler alone, the results were less impressive. Intrahepatic flow abnormalities were identified, but the sites of occlusion were not determined convincingly. Signals transmitted from the heart and the inability to visualize the hepatic veins made duplex Doppler evaluation problematic. Duplex Doppler was able to define patency and the direction of flow in the portal vein and inferior vena cava. Our results suggest that color-flow Doppler is an excellent technique for the initial evaluation of patients suspected of having Budd-Chiari syndrome. In the evaluation of decompressive mesoatrial shunts, color-flow Doppler produced dramatic images. However, both duplex and color-flow Doppler were highly accurate in determining the patency of decompressive shunts. Either duplex or color-flow Doppler may be used as the primary imaging procedure to determine shunt patency.\r"

  ".W": "To compare stress/rest technetium 99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) with stress redistribution thallium 201(T1-201) myocardial perfusion imaging, 36 patients were studied by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and planar methods. For SPECT, overall sensitivities for identification of patients with coronary artery disease were 93% (14/15) by Tc-MIBI and 80% (12/15) by TI-201 (p = NS). For planar methods, overall sensitivities were 73% (11/15) by both TI-201 and Tc-MIBI. Overall specificity was 75% (3/4 patients with normal coronary arteries) for both tracers with SPECT and Tc-MIBI by planar imaging and was 50% for planar TI-201 (p = NS). The normalcy rates for overall identification of coronary artery disease were determined in 17 patients with a low likelihood of disease. For SPECT, normalcy rates were 100% by Tc-MIBI and 77% by TI-201 (p = NS). For planar, they were 94% by Tc-MIBI and 88% by TI-201 (p = NS). Vessel sensitivities in the 35 stenosed coronary arteries (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) for SPECT were 87% by Tc-MIBI and 77% by TI-201 (p = NS). For planar, the vessel sensitivities were 60% by Tc-MIBI and 54% by TI-201 (p = NS). For both tracers, the SPECT vessel sensitivities were significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than planar vessel sensitivities. The vessel specificities in 22 coronary vessels with less than 50% stenosis were 86% by SPECT Tc-MIBI and TI-201, 80% by planar Tc-MIBI and 73% by planar TI-201 (p = NS, SPECT vs planar, Tc-MIBI vs TI-201). Regarding myocardial segmental agreement, for the presence of stress defects the agreement was 91% for the 720 SPECT segments and 95% for the 540 planar segments. For severity of stress defects based on semiquantitative visual scoring, the exact agreement was 87% for SPECT and 80% for planar. For the pattern of reversibility in myocardial segments with stress defects, the agreement was 97% for SPECT and 91% for planar. This study demonstrated that Tc-MIBI and TI-201 correlate well on both planar and SPECT images with respect to the identification of patients with coronary artery disease, identification of disease in individual coronary arteries, the presence and severity of perfusion defects, and the assessment of defect reversibility. Furthermore, SPECT Tc-MIBI was shown to be superior to planar Tc-MIBI for the identification of individual diseased vessels.\r"

Changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, epinephrine, bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations were also measured. To determine whether the prostaglandins contribute to the peripheral hemodynamic response to captopril, the hemodynamic and hormonal measurements were repeated after pretreatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Ninety minutes after administering a single dose of captopril (25 mg), mean blood pressure and venous pressure decreased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), forearm blood flow and maximum venous volume increased (p less than 0.05 for both), and forearm vascular resistance and forearm venous tone decreased (p less than 0.05 for both). Captopril also improved forearm venous distensibility (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with oral indomethacin (50 mg) significantly blunted all of these captopril-induced hemodynamic changes. The blockage of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril was unaltered by indomethacin pretreatment. Captopril significantly increased plasma bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (p less than 0.05 for each). Indomethacin pretreatment did not affect the captopril-induced increase in bradykinin, but it did completely eliminate the increase in the prostaglandins. Plasma catecholamines did not change with captopril. These data suggest that the vasodilator prostaglandins play a significant role in captopril's peripheral vasodilative effects in congestive heart failure.\r"

These ambulatory ECG ST segment changes that occur with and without symptoms, although thought to be of questionable clinical value for many years, have recently been clearly documented in coronary artery disease patients to represent true myocardial ischemia. Concurrent with these technologic developments has been an evolution of the pathophysiologic understanding of myocardial ischemia, and the relative role and sequential nature that ECG ST segment changes have in its development. This review examines from a clinical perspective the current understanding of the pathophysiologic sequence of development of myocardial ischemia, emphasizes the ECG diagnostic methods that detect this sequential change, examines the criteria that define ambulatory ECG myocardial ischemia, and discusses those nonischemic factors that affect the ECG ST segment and its interpretation. Moreover, an ever increasing number of ambulatory ECG studies of coronary artery disease and normal patients have defined unique characteristics of the ambulatory ECG ST segment changes observed with regard to its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic assessment value in the study of myocardial ischemia.\r"

In vitro validation of the technique showed precision to within 10% at flow rates greater than 300 ml/min. Assessment of common carotid artery blood flow was used to calculate vascular resistance in a single-blind, crossover study of 16 elderly patients over the age of 60 years (mean 67.7 +/- 6.5) with essential hypertension. The pulsatility index of the brachial artery was also determined. Before the study patients had previously received either placebo (twice a day) for 2 weeks or slow-release (SR) nicardipine (40 mg twice a day) for 2 months. During the study patients received a single 40 mg dose of nicardipine SR, after which mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 131 +/- 11 to 110 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and from 122 +/- 13 to 108 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) in patients who had previously received placebo and nicardipine, respectively. Carotid vascular resistance decreased from 14.6 +/- 2.9 to 10.4 +/- 2.8 mm Hg.sec.ml-1 (p less than 0.001) and from 14.6 +/- 4.1 to 11.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg.sec.ml-1 (p less than 0.01), respectively. The pulsatility index of the brachial artery changed from 9.4 +/- 4.4 to 9.7 +/- 8.3 and from 8.2 +/- 4.3 to 9.4 +/- 4.1, respectively (not significant). These data show that nicardipine SR reduces resistance both in the common carotid artery and in the brachial artery. Furthermore this drug appears to have an additional effect on the distensibility of the large arteries.\r"

Parameters measured included blood pressure, blood chemistry (serum creatinine, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, blood glucose total cholesterol, and electrolytes), plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration. Nicardipine was effective in reducing blood pressure in all patients with diabetic nephropathy, parenchymal renal diseases, or hypertensive nephropathy, and in those without renal dysfunction. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were slightly elevated in some patients whose pretreatment serum creatinine level was greater than 2 mg/dl, regardless of the type of nephropathy. However, it was not determined whether this effect was the result of a reduction in blood pressure induced by nicardipine. Serum sodium, potassium, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels were unchanged by the administration of nicardipine. Changes in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were not significant. These results suggest that nicardipine can be used safely in elderly patients with hypertension with renal dysfunction, regardless of the type of nephropathy.\r"

The initial dose of nicardipine was 20 mg every 8 hours, which was then increased to 30 mg if needed. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured 1 and 8 hours after doses at each visit with subjects in both the supine and standing positions. Seventy-six per cent of patients who received nicardipine and 55% who received placebo responded (p less than 0.05). During standing, blood pressure did not decrease significantly from supine levels in either group, but a small, transient increase in heart rate occurred with nicardipine. Adverse reactions (apart from failure to respond) occurred in 8% of those who received nicardipine and 3% who received placebo. Three patients were withdrawn: two for symptoms, nausea, or flushing and one for transient and asymptomatic abnormalities on ECG. Nicardipine is effective and safe as monotherapy in elderly patients with hypertension, causing greater reduction in systolic than in diastolic pressure, but without orthostatic hypotension.\r"

After 4 weeks, nicardipine lowered mean blood pressure (186/99 to 150/83 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), and the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in the nicardipine group than in the placebo group. Nicardipine was well tolerated; orthostatic hypotension was not observed and there was no change in heart rate. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in eight patients, but there was no correlation between PRA and the antihypertensive effect of nicardipine. Results of a pharmacokinetic study performed in 15 elderly patients showed a rapid rate of absorption and higher plasma levels than those observed in younger patients with hypertension (mean age 54 years). The results support those of the major French multicenter open study of 29, 104 elderly patients with hypertension (mean age 64 +/- 12 years) treated with nicardipine. The findings of this trial are reviewed and discussed, and recommendations made on the directions for future research in cardiovascular medicine with calcium channel blockers. Results of the trials discussed in this article show that nicardipine is an effective and well-tolerated drug in elderly patients and has wide-ranging effects on the cardiovascular system.\r"

Men and women were compared for differences in baseline characteristics, long-term survival (by means of the Cox proportional hazards models), and predictors of long-term survival. In this study women, at baseline, were older and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes compared to men; whereas men were more likely to have had prior coronary heart disease. In this study of CASS participants there was no difference between men and women with regard to survival after CABG. There was also no difference between men and women in predictors of 6-year mortality. Two baseline variables were strongly related to subsequent mortality in both men and women: a high left ventricular wall motion score and taking both digitalis and diuretics (for women: relative risk = 2.31, confidence interval = 1.38 to 3.87; for men: relative risk = 1.90, confidence interval = 1.45 to 2.50).\r"

Pericarditis, defined by the detection of a pericardial rub, occurred in 20% of the patients (n = 141) and was more likely to follow Q wave than non-Q wave infarction (25% vs 9%, p less than 0.001). Patients with pericarditis experienced more serious myocardial damage compared to those without pericarditis, as evidenced by a larger infarct size (25 +/- 1 vs 17 +/- 1 MB-CK gm-Eq/m2, p less than 0.001), a lower admission left ventricular ejection fraction (42 +/- 1% vs 48 +/- 1%, p less than 0.001), and a higher incidence of congestive heart failure (47% vs 26%, p less than 0.001) and atrial tachyarrhythmias (16% vs 10%, p less than 0.05). When patients were classified by the presence of Q or non-Q wave infarction, these differences persisted although statistical significance was not always achieved due to smaller sample size. Mortality at 12-month follow-up for patients with pericarditis was 18% compared with 12% for patients without pericarditis (p = 0.055). This mortality difference could be accounted for in part by the lower ventricular ejection fraction in patients with pericarditis (p = 0.20 after adjustment).\r"

Since antihypertensive therapy actually increases the dollar cost of medical care, the use of more expensive agents needs to be justified in terms of better blood pressure control, improved quality of life, and reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Data from the clinical trials have not shown the more expensive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers to be superior to the less expensive agents such as diuretic drugs in reducing blood pressure or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Poor compliance may reduce both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Physicians must play an active role in prompting compliance by assuring the patient's ability to incorporate the prescribed dosage regimen into daily routine, by actively monitoring compliance, by modifying the regimen appropriately to remove the cause of noncompliance, and by switching medication if it is ineffective or if adverse effects occur.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is a common belief that all antihypertensive agents are equally effective in reducing blood pressure, there is some evidence to the contrary, both in the general population and when specific patient demographics are considered. In black patients, beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be less effective at reducing blood pressure than the thiazide diuretics. After age 60, the percentage of responders to beta blockers is less than with calcium antagonists, and a higher percentage of elderly patients also achieve normotensive blood pressure levels with diuretic therapy than with beta blockers. When a thiazide diuretic is added to an ACE inhibitor, beta blocker or calcium antagonist, the number of normotensive responders increases significantly. Combinations of some other agents (i.e., an ACE inhibitor plus a beta blocker) may not, however, improve efficacy. Diuretics, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are all generally well tolerated, with a 9 to 10% incidence of subjective side effects. The use of calcium antagonists and especially the centrally acting adrenergic inhibitors may result in more frequent adverse effects. Data from long-term, diuretic-based clinical trials do not support the statement that diuretic therapy results in sustained elevations in lipid levels. These trials have shown cholesterol levels to be at or below baseline after long-term diuretic therapy. The use of beta blockers, on the other hand, may result in long-term elevation of triglyceride levels and a slight decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors do not affect lipid levels, and alpha blockers may actually lower cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, their undesirable metabolic consequences have been suspected of contributing to increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Even at low doses, there is a definite decrease in both potassium and magnesium levels. The degree of decrease in potassium and magnesium levels has been shown to be directly related to the hydrochlorothiazide dosage. Many investigators have now reported an increase in ventricular ectopy associated with diuretic-induced hypokalemia. Whereas there is no single study that conclusively proves that thiazide therapy results in malignant arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden death, the circumstantial evidence is strong. Although sodium restriction is critical to potassium restoration, it rarely works alone. Potassium chloride supplementation can be effective in restoring potassium but not magnesium. Potassium-sparing diuretic combinations can both prevent and treat hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, possibly reducing the risk of potentially lethal arrhythmias and sudden death.\r"

The risk of heart attack and stroke is increased regardless of whether the elevation of blood pressure is primarily systolic alone, diastolic alone, or both. In treating mild to moderate hypertension and in prevention and wellness programs in normotensive persons with a family history of the disease, the initial approach should be nonpharmacologic. Patients who remain hypertensive should proceed to drug therapy. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain the preferred first step in elderly patients. In patients younger than age 40 years, especially those with tachycardia, a beta blocker may be used as the first step. Treatment should be initiated with less than a full dose, only proceeding to a full dose if necessary. If there is any appearance of extrasystoles, or a decrease in potassium levels to below 3.5 mEq/liter in the elderly, a potassium-sparing diuretic combination should be used. Although there is growing evidence that the effects of diuretic drugs on potassium may contribute to arrhythmias and sudden death, there is also increasing data suggesting that conserving electrolytes during diuretic therapy may obviate these ill effects.\r"

Fifty-nine percent of patients were classified as responders as defined by study criteria. An additional 4 weeks of therapy (Period 3) for responders produced no further change in BP. Nonresponders as a group continued to have a further decrease in BP in Period 3. However, only patients in whom therapy was transferred to TMT 75 mg/HCTZ 50 mg had a statistically significant decrease. All patients who changed to the higher dose combination achieved goal BP by the end of the study. Of the nonresponders who continued to take TMT 37.5 mg/HCTZ 25 mg, 69% achieved goal diastolic BP by the end of Period 3. Three patients were withdrawn because of adverse experiences, 1 of which was considered treatment related. Of 58 reports of adverse experiences, 8 were considered possibly related and 2 probably related to therapy.

Only diuretics and beta blockers have been studied in long-term trials to determine their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP), Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, European Working Party on Hypertension in the Elderly (EWPHE) trial, Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension, and the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study all showed a reduction in stroke rate. The EWPHE and HDFP trials were the only studies to show a statistically significant reduction in mortality from myocardial infarction. All of these were diuretic-based; in addition, the MRC trial also used a beta blocker as first-step therapy in 1 cohort. The International Primary Prospective Prevention Study in Hypertension and Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) trials compared beta-blocker and non-beta-blocker or diuretic-based therapies and found no significant difference between the treatment groups in the incidence of stroke or cardiac events. Neither study had a control group, so it was impossible to determine if there was any reduction in stroke or cardiac events. The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension trial, an extension of the HAPPHY trial, showed that smokers receiving the beta blocker metoprolol had a significantly lower cardiovascular mortality rate than those randomized to a diuretic drug. However, subgroup analysis of the HAPPHY data showed no differences in the effect of beta blockers and diuretics in smokers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

IAA, a weakly bound ligand, was rapidly excreted by the transplanted kidney during the first one to three days after renal transplantation, but CMPF, a strongly bound ligand, was slowly excreted. The binding defect of phenytoin was partially corrected by transplantation during the period of study. The results suggested that the prolonged drug binding defect observed despite successful renal transplantation is caused by a slower decrease of strongly bound ligands such as CMPF retained in uremic serum; hypoalbuminemia, usually observed after transplantation, may also contribute to this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Factors associated with physical well-being were examined in a population-based sample of adult end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in Michigan (n = 459). The dependent variables were two measures of physical functioning: (1) a ten-item measure of activities of daily living (ADL), and (2) the 45-item physical dysfunction dimension of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Independent variables included four modalities of treatment (in-center hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD], related transplant, and cadaver transplant); primary cause of ESRD (eg, diabetes, glomerulonephritis); comorbidity (other illnesses besides primary cause of ESRD); and demographic characteristics (sex, race, age, marital status, education). ADL and SIP unadjusted mean scores differed significantly by category for each of the eight study factors (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P less than 0.0001), with the exception of sex for SIP means. The highest levels of dependency in ADL were reported by patients who were older, female, black, widowed, less educated, treated with in-center hemodialysis, had diabetes as the primary cause of ESRD, and/or reported more comorbidity. The partial effect of each factor on the dependent measures with adjustment for the seven other factors was assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In the ADL analysis, sex, race, age, primary cause of kidney failure, and comorbidity were significant factors (probability values ranging from 0.05 for race to 0.0001 for sex, primary cause of ESRD, and comorbidity). The SIP physical dysfunction measure gave slightly different results. Race, age, primary cause of ESRD, comorbid status, and modality of treatment were significantly related to physical dysfunction (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dialysis patients had markedly elevated beta 2M levels; prehemodialysis values were not significantly different for patients receiving conventional v HF hemodialysis. Most of these patients were functionally anephric, and the beta 2M levels did not correlate with age, sex, or time on dialysis. In patients receiving conventional hemodialysis using cellulose acetate membrane, beta 2M levels increased 25.4% after hemodialysis, whereas in patients receiving HF hemodialysis using polysulfone membrane, beta 2M levels decreased significantly (43.0%) after hemodialysis. End-stage renal disease patients dialyzed for the first time had beta 2M values significantly lower than the other two groups because of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CAPD patients also had lower values because they had an estimated loss of 80.4 mg/d of beta 2M in the dialysate fluid. In patients with chronic renal failure, beta 2M levels paralleled the increase in serum creatinine. Patients who received kidney transplants had a dramatic decrease in beta 2M levels that correlated with improvement in GFR. beta 2M correlated with the residual GFR, and its removal was membrane-dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 479 cases (218 males and 261 females) occurred during this period in 1,298,267 consecutive live births, for an incidence of 3.7/10,000. There were more females, with the sex ratio being significantly different from that of the general population born over this period. No significant seasonal differences were observed over the time period. A comparison of life expectancy for individuals born 1962-1970 and 1970-1986 showed significant improvement in the probability of surviving to the age of 1 year for the latter group. There was also a small but statistically significant increased chance of surviving to age 7 years in the latter group but no difference in the probability of surviving from 7 years to 16 years. Life expectancy figures are shown in a format practical for counseling with regard to prognosis for affected individuals. Additional malformations not attributable to SBHC were observed in 6% (27 cases). These included renal anomalies, cleft lip and/or palate, tracheoesophageal fistula, and diaphragmatic hernia. The incidence of each defect was significantly greater than in the general population of births.\r"

Fetal risk was estimated prospectively by linkage analysis using intragenic and flanking RFLPs and retrospectively using dystrophin cDNA analysis for families whose linkage estimates lacked precision. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by comparing predictions with 40 male pregnancy outcomes. On the basis of linkage analysis, we anticipated 3.2 DMD males and observed 3.0.

  ".W": "Serial ultrasound examinations were performed during the third trimester in 79 pregnant women with diabetes to establish the onset of accelerated fetal growth. At least three ultrasound examinations were performed, with a minimum scan interval of 2 weeks. Growth curves constructed for femur length and head circumference were similar for fetuses appropriate for gestational age (n = 48) and fetuses large for gestational age (n = 31). The mean changes in femur length and head circumference (expressed as centimeters per week during the early and late third trimesters) did not differ statistically between these two groups. Abdominal circumference growth was clearly accelerated at 32 weeks' gestation in the large for gestational age group (mean +/- SD, 1.36 +/- 0.16 cm/wk) compared with the appropriate for gestational age group (0.901 +/- 0.21 cm/wk, p less than 0.001). With use of a receiver operator characteristic curve, a change in abdominal circumference of 1.2 cm/wk over the period of 32 to 39 weeks' gestation was determined to be an optimal cutoff for detecting excessive fetal growth (sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). A change in abdominal circumference 1.2 cm/wk was present in 4/4 large-for-gestational age fetuses (less than 4000 gm), in 17/21 (81%) of fetuses with birth weights 4000 to 4499 gm, and in 5/6 (83%) whose weight exceeded 4500 gm. It appears that improved detection of the fetus large for gestational age in diabetic pregnancies may be accomplished by the use of serial ultrasonography during the third trimester.\r"

The uteroplacental and umbilical circulations were assessed with Doppler ultrasonography. The ratio of the systolic/diastolic velocity in the uterine artery was elevated, which suggests that uteroplacental vascular resistance increased. The fetal heart rate was elevated after exercise, whereas the systolic/diastolic velocity ratio in the umbilical artery was unaltered. We conclude that moderate maternal exercise causes increased resistance to blood flow in the uterine circulation, whereas the umbilical circulation remains unaltered.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the relationship between systolic/diastolic ratios as determined by umbilical velocimetry to fetal heart rate. Umbilical velocimetry was performed with continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound and systolic/diastolic ratios and fetal heart rate for the corresponding cardiac cycles were calculated in four groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients undergoing antepartum fetal testing; systolic/diastolic ratios were found to be significantly lower (mean +/- SD, 2.0 +/- 0.15) during an evoked fetal heart rate acceleration with an artificial larynx than either before (2.4 +/- 0.14) or after the acceleration (2.35 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01). In 20 patients with pyelonephritis (group 2), systolic/diastolic ratios were significantly lower during initial fetal tachycardia (1.6 +/- 0.21) as compared with those obtained after its resolution (2.1 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.08). In the 25 patients with chorioamnionitis in group 3, systolic/diastolic ratios were significantly higher during initial fetal tachycardia (1.4 +/- 0.21) than after its resolution (1.9 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05). Twenty patients in labor (group 4) had 10 serial measurements at 1 to 2-hour intervals of systolic/diastolic ratio and FHR. Least-squares regression of each patient showed a negative slope that differed statistically from zero (p less than 0.05). There were no patients with elevated systolic/diastolic ratios greater than 3.0 in any group and all patients delivered fetuses appropriate for gestational age. These findings suggest an inverse relationship between systolic/diastolic ratio and fetal heart rate. Additionally, an alteration in fetal heart rate within the range studied does not itself produce abnormal ratios. Therefore normalization of the systolic/diastolic ratio for heart rate may be considered in clinical studies for statistical analysis and comparison but may have little practical or clinical relevance when the ratios are abnormal.\r"

When a cutoff value of 3 was used at 30 weeks for the umbilical arteries, there were 35 (13%) positive tests. In 20 of these values fell to less than 3 in the ensuing weeks and were considered false positive. The remaining 15 babies demonstrated positive clinical pathologic correlates. When a value of 2.6 was used at 26 weeks for uterine arteries, there were nine positive results, seven of which had clinical pathologic correlates. This study suggested an overall positivity rate of 7%; therefore it provides encouragement for a larger venture in which screening and impact on decision making are evaluated.\r"

When compared with diabetic placental extracts, normal tissue also had more stored prohormone immunoreactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Whereas there were no consistent differences in placental human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations in normal tissues and tissues from insulin-dependent and gestational diabetes, there was a significant correlation between gonadotropin-releasing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations in normal samples (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05), which was abolished when the diabetic tissue was included in the analysis. These data suggest that differences in high-molecular-weight gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone concentrations in term placentas from normal versus diabetic mothers may be due to enhanced processing of the prohormone and increased release of the decapeptide in diabetic pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Ovaries from six women with normal menstrual cycles, a follicle wall biopsy specimen from a gonadotropin-stimulated preovulatory ovary, and a corpus luteum of pregnancy were examined by immunohistochemistry for the presence of immunoreactive renin and angiotensin II. Both antisera densely stained thecal and stromal cells (interstitial complex) and luteal cells. Whereas granulosa cells in developing follicles were either unstained or lightly stained, the heavily luteinized granulosa cells of the preovulatory stimulated follicle were strongly positive for immunoreactive renin and angiotensin II. These anatomic findings are consistent with gonadotropin-stimulated local production of both renin and angiotensin II in the human ovary and support the functional roles proposed for the ovarian renin-angiotensin system in follicle development, ovulation, and luteal function and during pregnancy.\r"

Preparations tested included acetazolamide tablets, acetazolamide Sequels, and methazolamide tablets. The effect of the three carbonic anhydrase inhibitors was assessed by using a statistical modeling approach as well as by evaluating the average maximum reduction in intraocular pressure for each preparation. Dosage and time effects were also determined. As expected, each drug preparation was more effective in reducing intraocular pressure when administered to a patient who had already been treated with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor preparation. The amount of intraocular pressure lowering was directly related to dose for both acetazolamide preparations. Of particular interest was the finding that maximal rapid reduction of intraocular pressure was obtained with a 500-mg dosage of acetazolamide tablets.\r"

The laser was used to cut away all corneal tissue outside a specially designed mold, which was developed to obtain a corneal lenticule of 10 mm in diameter and a constant thickness of 0.3 mm. The surface topography of the excimer laser-cut corneal lenticule was smoother and more regular on scanning electron microscopy than a hand-cut corneal lenticule, and the thickness was constant around the surface. No thermal or mechanical damage to the cornea was observed on light microscopy in the area adjacent to the cut.\r"

Using a broad biological approach, the author considers empathy from evolutionary, ontogenetic, and neurophysiological viewpoints. Emotional communication follows a developmental course in primate evolution and in individuals: specialized neural activity and CNS organization subserve the interpretation of social signals. Neurophysiological studies now in progress may shed light on fundamental questions about the nature of empathy.\r"
