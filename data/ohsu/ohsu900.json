  ".W": "Four juvenile rhesus macaques were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)MAC-Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from these SIVMAC-infected and from uninfected control macaques were assessed for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity monthly for 7 consecutive months, beginning 2 months after infection. Target cells consisted of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haploidentical parental PBMC which were stimulated with mitogen and then pulsed with heat-killed SIVMAC. CTL activity was demonstrated on all four infected animals. The effector cells are T cells which mediate cytotoxicity against SIVMAC-pulsed target cells in an MHC-restricted manner. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity is virus specific and predominantly, if not exclusively, mediated by CD8+ T cells; it is also MHC class-I restricted. Incubation of target cells with leupeptin prior to the cytotoxic assay inhibited target cell generation, suggesting that viral antigens are processed via an endocytic pathway.\r"

  ".W": "In this study carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, of HIV-1 were investigated. Oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids), prepared from the N-glycosidically-linked chains of the natural and recombinant forms of gp120, were used in conjunction with the intact glycoprotein to investigate reactivities with a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein (lectin) known as mannose-binding protein in human serum. Evidence is presented that the high-mannose-type oligosaccharides with seven, eight and nine mannose residues from both forms of gp120 are recognized by the serum lectin, and that these reactivities are unrelated to CD4 recognition. Reactivities of the two forms of envelope glycoprotein with macrophages derived from human blood monocytes and with the mannose-specific macrophage endocytosis receptor isolated from human placental membranes were also investigated. Evidence is presented that both forms of gp120 bind to the macrophage surface by multiple interactions in addition to CD4 binding, and that among these interactions is a carbohydrate-mediated binding to the endocytosis receptor. We propose that such carbohydrate-mediated interactions could form the basis of viral attachment to a variety of healthy and diseased tissues.\r"

Data from the AIDS supplement of the 1987 National Health Interview Survey provided information about the sociodemographic characteristics and AIDS-related variables and the expressed willingness to participate in a national serosurvey. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate simultaneously associations between the sociodemographic variables and AIDS-related variables with willingness to participate. Results show that those with sociodemographic characteristics most dissimilar from reported AIDS cases were least willing to participate while those with a high knowledge about AIDS, experience of the HIV test or tested people, and higher perceptions of risk were more willing to participate. We found two exceptions to this general result. First, respondents with no knowledge about AIDS, but a higher level of education, were less willing to participate than those with no knowledge and a lower level of education. Second, respondents with a higher perception of risk and a higher level of education were also less willing than those with high perception of risk and less education.\r"

A discussion is presented of the range of possible structures of networks of sexual contacts with extremes of assortative (within sexual activity groups) and disassortative (between sexual activity groups) mixing. The assortative mixing extreme is shown to generate the most rapid growth in the incidence of infection in the early stages of the epidemic while the disassortative extreme is shown to generate the epidemic of the largest magnitude over a long period. High within-group mixing (assortative) may generate multi-peak epidemics. The results are discussed in the context of both the interpretation of observed patterns of the spread of HIV and the acquisition of data on sexual contact patterns.\r"

There was some evidence of anti-HIV-1 activity in two patients, one of whom had an improvement in immune status, but 11 of the 16 patients showed a deterioration in either virologic or immunologic status. The majority of the patients under study remained clinically stable during the trial, but there was clinical deterioration in the three who entered with CD4 cell counts of less than 100 x 10(6)/l. On the basis of this trial, rifabutin as a single antiviral agent does not appear to be beneficial to ARC patients.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 15-mer oligopeptides which overlapped by five amino acids (AA) across the p24 of HIV-1SF2 and a similar series across the p18 of HIV-1SF2 were used to identify the locations of 13 anti-gag monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Three anti-p24 MAbs recognized sequences within the first 50 AA of the amino-terminal. Another anti-p24 recognized a conformational epitope in the centre of the protein and this MAb cross-reacted with two HIV-2 isolates suggesting conservation of this epitope between HIV-1 and HIV-2. One anti-p24 MAb recognized a linear sequence in the carboxy-terminal 100 AA and one p24 antibody was assumed to recognize a truly conformational epitope as it did not react with any of the linear peptides. Four anti-p18 MAbs were located at the carboxy-terminus of p18 with another MAb mapping slightly inwards from the carboxy-terminus and one anti-p18 MAb failed to bind to the p18 peptides. The carboxy-terminal distribution of the p18 MAbs indicated a highly immunogenic nature for this region in mice. None of the anti-p18 MAbs showed cross-reactivity with HIV-2 isolates, confirming the greater sequence variability of p18 over p24.\r"

On this basis a phase I study combining zidovudine treatment and a 10-day course of anti-CD4 MAb was performed in seven AIDS patients (Centers for Disease Control group IV). The treatment was well tolerated. MAb dosage and schedule were adjusted on the basis of circulating CD4+ cells and MAb pharmacokinetics; immunological and virological parameters were also monitored. One patient presented a transient increment in CD4+ T cells associated with augmented T-cell function, the suppression of p24 in the serum and a negative RT assay. A second patient had a steady increment of CD4+ T cells after completion of the treatment, with a transient decrease of serum p24 5 days after completion of the anti-CD4 protocol.\r"

Once the diagnosis is established, therapeutic and management decisions can be made more easily. The commercial availability of biotinylated probes for several of the DNA viruses most frequently encountered in brain infections of AIDS patients will provide wide application of these techniques to patient management.\r"

Only two of all 22 evaluable patients achieved a response (one complete and one partial response), of only brief duration (2 and 4 months, respectively). There was no such association between antiretroviral activity, increase in CD4+ cells and tumour response, as was reported during treatment with human recombinant interferon alpha (IFN-alpha).

As platelet cytosolic free [Ca2+] and plasma digitalis-like activity have been reported independently to be higher in some untreated hypertensive patients than in normotensive subjects, we have investigated a possible relationship between these two parameters. Platelet cytosolic free [Ca2+], determined using Quin-2, the capacity of plasma extracts to inhibit renal Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity and ouabain binding on human erythrocytes were measured in parallel in 25 untreated hypertensive patients and 11 normotensive subjects. Enhanced values for all 3 parameters were observed in the same hypertensive patient. Platelet cytosolic free [Ca2+] was positively correlated to the plasma digitalis-like activity, which was evaluated by the inhibition of Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity and ouabain binding (r = 0.430, P = .010 and r = 0.448, P = .006, respectively). These relationships were independent of age and blood pressure.

NA-R was enhanced by ouabain in both NT and EHT. The augmentation of NA-R following ouabain injection (delta NA-R) and % delta NA-R were significantly lower in EHT than in NT. Following ouabain injection, no significant change in PNA and blood Ca2+ was observed in both NT and EHT. NA-R negatively correlated with PNA and blood Ca2+, which were estimated just prior to noradrenaline infusion, before ouabain injection as well as after. After ouabain, the regression line between NA-R and PNA or blood Ca2+ shifted toward higher NA-R level in NT, unlike in EHT. These results suggest that an exogenous Na,K-ATPase inhibitor brings about a blunted enhancement of NA-R in EHT consistent with the presence of an endogenous Na,K-ATPase inhibitor in EHT.\r"

Reduced renal mass-saline hypertension in the rat, is a low renin, volume expanded form of hypertension. Rats with this type of hypertension have been shown to have depressed arterial Na-K pump activity and increased Na-K pump inhibitory activity in their plasma. Canrenone treatment caused a progressive decrease in blood pressure in the hypertensive rats and this was associated with normalization of Na-K pump activity in arteries. Water and salt intake and excretion did not change. On the other hand, canrenone progressively increased blood pressure in the normotensive rats and this was associated with positive inotropy in isolated papillary muscles. These findings suggest that the depressed pump activity and the pump inhibitor play a role in reduced renal mass-saline hypertension in the rat and that the rise in blood pressure in the normotensive rats probably reflects canrenone's ability, by itself, to inhibit Na-K-ATPase.\r"

  ".W": "Nephrotoxicity is the most common and important side effect of cyclosporine (CyA) therapy. It is characterized by a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and by a decrease in sodium and water excretion. Since atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to increase GFR and to cause a potent diuretic and natriuretic effect, we have investigated the potential beneficial action of ANP on CyA induced renal injury. To this end two groups of animals were studied: 1) rats that received an intravenous infusion of CyA (20 mg/kg body weight) (acute studies) and 2) rats that have been treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of CyA (20 mg/kg body weight) for a total of seven days (chronic studies). To both groups of rats synthetic ANP was administered intravenously as a bolus (10 micrograms/kg) and then as a constant infusion (1 microgram/kg/min). In group 1 the CyA administration resulted in a decrease in GFR, urine output, urinary sodium and potassium excretion. After ANP infusion there was a prompt restoration of GFR, with a large rise in urine, sodium and potassium excretion rates. Similar effects on renal hemodynamics and electrolyte excretion rates were detected after ANP administration in chronic CyA treatment. These data show that the administration of ANP to rats that have been exposed to acute or chronic CyA treatment is able to reverse the harmful effect of CyA on renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerve endings is inhibited by substances which raise cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in neural tissue. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) elevates cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Thus, EDRF may also modulate the release of norepinephrine (NE) from adrenergic nerves. We tested this postulate in isolated canine pulmonary arteries and veins using the technique of superfusion and measurement of the efflux of radiolabeled NE during transmural nerve stimulation at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Hz for 10 min. In segments of artery and vein with intact endothelium the contractile responses to low frequency nerve stimulation were decreased when compared to endothelium rubbed blood vessels. Electrical stimulation of arteries and veins with intact endothelium for 10 min released less 2-[14C]-NE than rubbed blood vessels, especially at the lower frequencies of 1, 2 and 4 Hz, with lesser effects at frequencies of 16 and 32 Hz. Using the technique of bioassay, EDRF from porcine thoracic aorta inhibited the efflux of 2-[14C]-NE from the pulmonary artery and vein. The findings support the conclusion that the endothelium can inhibit release of NE from sympathetic nerve innervating canine pulmonary artery and vein. The endothelium, in part through EDRF, can act as an endogenous inhibitor or sympathetic neurotransmitter release.\r"

PGE2 receptors were determined by a radioligand binding method using [3H]-PGE2. Adenylate cyclase responses to PGE2, sodium fluoride (NaF) and forskolin were also measured. The concentration of PGE2 receptor was increased in SHR compared with WKY. PGE2- and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly lower in SHR than WKY. There was no significant difference in forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity between SHR and WKY. NaF activates the nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G-protein) and forskolin directly activates the catalytic unit. These results indicate that the activity of G-protein coupled with renal PGE2 receptors is deficient in SHR. This defect may contribute to the elevation of blood pressure, through sodium retention.\r"

Hemodynamic data were obtained during cardiac catheterization and venous plasma samples for ANP were withdrawn prior to surgery. Probes for determination of tissue ANP levels and ANPmRNA concentrations were taken from the right atrium. Both plasma ANP (r = 0.75; P less than .05) and ANPmRNA (r = 0.86; P less than .01) were closely related to mean pulmonary artery pressure. ANPmRNA was also related to plasma ANP (r = 0.60; P less than .07). However, no significant relationships were obtained between either plasma ANP or ANPmRNA and right atrial ANP concentrations. These data suggest that right atrial ANP synthesis is regulated by cardiac filling pressures and possibly by plasma ANP levels, independent from corresponding ANP tissue concentrations.\r"

These include modulation of renal hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and tubular reabsorption. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to localize the Ang II receptors and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in rat, rabbit, and human kidney. We incubated 20 microns cryostat sections of kidney with either 125I-[Sar1]Ang II or 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for Ang II binding or with 125I-351A for ACE localization. The resulting autoradiographs were analyzed by computerized densitometry. A high density of Ang II binding was found over glomeruli and vasa recta bundles in all species examined. The interbundle area of the outer medulla was associated with low to moderate binding of Ang II. Moderate binding of Ang II was observed over proximal convoluted tubules in the outer cortex of rat kidney. ACE was predominantly distributed in proximal convoluted tubules in all species. These studies reveal multiple sites where Ang II could modulate renal function by acting on the renal vasculature, glomeruli, vasa recta bundles, and proximal tubular sites.\r"

  ".U": "90212481\r", 
  ".W": "There is growing evidence that keratinocyte (KC) intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I) expression is involved in the epidermal trafficking of T lymphocytes. To further characterize the molecular basis of KC ICAM-I expression, the detailed kinetics of induction by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), as well as the phorbol ester, 12-O tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), were studied. This study reports that KCs express both the class II major histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR) and ICAM-I in response to IFN-gamma, although the response is distinctive for each molecule. Also, TPA induces ICAM-I, but not HLA-DR expression, whilst the protein kinase inhibitor, H7, blocks the TPA, but not the IFN-gamma-mediated response. The results provide a molecular basis whereby non-cytokine-mediated stimuli (e.g. TPA) alter KC signal transduction events involving protein kinase-C (PK-C) and thereby generate such immunologically relevant events as ICAM-I expression. Thus, KCs may be targets for both T-cell derived cytokines (e.g. IFN-gamma), and non-cytokine TPA-like molecules which stimulate PK-C. Induction of ICAM-I by either mechanism would be capable of instigating intraepidermal T-cell trafficking.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of 111 consecutive patients; patients with vertebral compression fractures were entered into a case-control study. SETTING--Outpatient clinic at the centre for rheumatic diseases, Glasgow. PATIENTS--111 Consecutive patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Patients with compression fractures were matched for age and sex with two controls selected from the rest of the group. Patients with biconcave vertebral fractures were also studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Assessments of spinal deformity and mobility and analysis of lateral radiographs of spines for presence of syndesmophytes. RESULTS--Fifteen patients with compression fractures and five with biconcave fractures were studied. Compared with the controls the patients with compression fractures had increased formation of syndesmophytes in the lumbar spine, whereas those with biconcave fractures had increased formation throughout the spine. Patients with compression fractures also had a greater degree of spinal deformity (distance from wall to tragus 24.5 cm v 12.7 cm in controls), less spinal mobility (20 v 45.6 degrees of flexion), and reduced chest expansion (2 cm v 3cm). CONCLUSION--Vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis are a common but frequently unrecognised complication of ankylosing spondylitis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of spinal deformity and back pain.\r"

DESIGN--Men and women attending screening and followed up for a mean of 6.4 years. SETTING--Cardiovascular survey performed by ambulatory teams from the National Health Screening Service in Norway. PARTICIPANTS--All middle aged people in three counties: 19,398 men and 19,166 women aged 35-54 years who reported neither cardiovascular disease or diabetes nor symptoms of angina pectoris or intermittent claudication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Predictive value of number of cups of coffee consumed per day. RESULTS--At initial screening total serum cholesterol concentration, high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, height, and weight were measured and self reported information about smoking history, physical activity, and coffee drinking habits was recorded. Altogether 168 men and 16 women died of coronary heart disease during follow up. Mean cholesterol concentrations for men and women were almost identical and increased from the lowest to highest coffee consumption group (13.1% and 10.9% respectively). With the proportional hazards model and adjustment for age, total serum and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, systolic blood pressure, and number of cigarettes per day the coefficient for coffee corresponded to a relative risk between nine or more cups of coffee and less than one cup of 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.5) for men and 5.1 (0.4 to 60.3) for women. For men the relative risk varied among the three counties. CONCLUSIONS--Coffee may affect mortality from coronary heart disease over and above its effect in raising cholesterol concentrations.\r"

PATIENTS--691 Patients treated by angioplasty for renovascular hypertension, 464 for atherosclerotic stenosis, 193 for fibromuscular stenosis, and the remainder mainly for post-transplant stenosis. The inclusion criteria varied considerably between studies. INTERVENTIONS--Percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (successful or attempted); prophylaxis against restenosis in most cases. Policies on antihypertensive drug treatment and follow up varied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood pressure response as defined in the individual papers, with each patient classified as either cured, improved, or failed. Each study used a different definition of improvement in blood pressure. Complication rates. RESULTS--Follow up data were available for 670 patients. The procedure was technically successful in 611 patients (88%). The overall cure rate for hypertension was 24% (163 patients) and a further 43% (286) were \"improved.\" There were large and significant variations between studies in the rate of technical success and also the blood pressure outcome. In each series patients with fibromuscular lesions, had a higher cure rate than those with atherosclerotic lesions (overall cure 50% v 19% odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 6.0). Complications were reported in 63 (9%) patients and three patients died (0.4%). CONCLUSIONS--The evidence for the value of angioplasty in treating renovascular hypertension has serious limitations. Angioplasty for fibromuscular disease seems to be worth while, but for atherosclerotic lesions the benefit appears to be small and its efficacy needs to be compared with medical therapy in randomised trials. These findings emphasise the importance of early formal evaluation of new therapeutic techniques.\r"

PATIENTS--118 Patients receiving haemodialysis aged 18-75 with haemoglobin concentrations less than 90 g/l, no causes of anaemia other than erythropoietin deficiency, and no other serious diseases. INTERVENTIONS--Patients were randomised to three groups to receive placebo (n = 40), erythropoietin to achieve a haemoglobin concentration of 95-110 g/l (n = 40), or erythropoietin to achieve a haemoglobin concentration of 115-130 g/l (n = 38). Erythropoietin was given intravenously thrice weekly, initially at 100 units/kg/dose. The dose was subsequently adjusted to achieve the target haemoglobin concentration. All patients with a serum ferritin concentration less than 250 micrograms/l received oral or intravenous iron for one month before the study and as necessary throughout the trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores obtained with kidney disease questionnaire, sickness impact profile, and time trade off technique; and results of six minute walk test and modified Naughton stress test. RESULTS--The mean (SD) haemoglobin concentration at six months was 74 (12) g/l in patients given placebo, 102 (10) g/l in those in the low erythropoietin group, and 117 (17) g/l in those in the high erythropoietin group. Compared with the placebo group, patients treated with erythropoietin had a significant improvement in their scores for fatigue, physical symptoms, relationships, and depression on the kidney disease questionnaire and in the global and physical scores on the sickness impact profile. The distance walked in the stress test increased in the group treated with erythropoietin, but there was no improvement in the six minute walk test, psychosocial scores on the sickness impact profile, or time trade off scores. There was no significant difference in the improvement in quality of life or exercise capacity between the two groups taking erythropoietin. Patients taking erythropoietin had a significantly increased diastolic blood pressure despite an increase in either the dose or number of antihypertensive drugs used. Eleven of 78 patients treated with erythropoietin had their sites of access clotted compared with only one of 40 patients given placebo. CONCLUSIONS--Patients receiving erythropoietin were appreciably less fatigued, complained of less severe physical symptoms, and had moderate improvements in exercise tolerance and depression compared with patients not receiving erythropoietin. At the doses used in this trial there was a higher incidence of hypertension and clotting of the vascular access in patients treated with erythropoietin.\r"

The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics varied greatly among the countries, from 31.2% in The Netherlands to 98.2% in both Australia and New Zealand, as did the duration of treatment. Patients who did not take antibiotics had a higher rate of recovery than those who did; the rate of recovery did not differ between different types of antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS--Doctors' certainty of diagnosis of acute otitis media was linked to patient's age. Improved criteria or techniques for diagnosing acute otitis media, especially in very young children, need to be developed. Antibiotic treatment did not improve the rate of recovery of patients in this study.\r"

This seems to apply whether the prescribing is part of a \"harm reduction\" strategy over a long period or whether it is a short period of methadone substitution treatment. Given the 50% prevalence of HIV infection among drug users in the Edinburgh area and the fact that only half of them have been tested for seropositivity, the health and care of this demanding group of young people with a chaotic lifestyle are better shared among primary care, community based drug workers, and specialist community drugs team than treated exclusively by a centralised hospital drug dependency unit. As the progression to AIDS is predictable in a larger proportion of drug users who are positive for HIV, there is an even greater need for coordinated care between specialists and community agencies in the near future.\r"

Nabumetone may thus avoid the occurrence of gastric erosion while maintaining its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory drug. We compared the effects of nabumetone and 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA; the principal metabolite of nabumetone) with naproxen and indomethacin on in vitro synthesis of the gastroprotective prostaglandins I2 and E2 by human gastric mucosa. To study the effects of 6MNA on peripheral target tissues the effects of the above NSAIDs on human platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 synthesis were also studied. Prostanoid synthesis by the human gastric mucosa was inhibited by indomethacin, naproxen and 6MNA (in this order of potency) whereas nabumetone was completely without effect. Platelet aggregation and thromboxane A2 synthesis were similarly inhibited by the NSAIDS (viz. indomethacin greater than naproxen greater than 6MNA greater than nabumetone). These results support the view that nabumetone does not inhibit gastroprotective prostanoid synthesis, whereas its active metabolite 6MNA is an effective inhibitor of prostanoid synthesis in target tissues.\r"

Results of 42 randomized, controlled trials (4129 patients), in which a group of patients treated with antibiotics was compared with a group of patients not treated with antibiotics, were pooled. Wound infection rates in the control groups range from 3 to 47 per cent and are 15 per cent overall. The overall difference in infection rates is 9 per cent in favour of antibiotic treatment (95 per cent confidence interval 7-11 per cent), while the common odds ratio is 0.30 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.23-0.38). Subgroup meta-analysis showed a significant stronger protective effect in high risk patients, while the timing of wound inspection (i.e. early in hospital or late at follow-up) markedly influenced the treatment effect reported. Comparison of wound infection rates in patients treated with first generation versus second or third generation cephalosporins (11 trials, 1128 patients), as well as single-dose versus multiple-dose regimens (15 trials, 1226 patients) did not reveal any significant effect (P greater than 0.05) in each trial separately as well as in the overall comparison. The results indicate that there is evidence against further use of no-treatment controls and that the choice of treatment regimen can largely be made on the basis of cost.\r"

The pulmonary vasculature can be divided into arterial, middle and venous segment resistances. Analysis of the vascular pressure-flow relationship further separates resistance into a flow dependent resistance (1/slope) and a zero-flow pressure intercept (PCRIT). We ventilated six lobes with control (35 per cent O2) and hypoxic (three per cent O2) gas mixtures with the addition of either 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 per cent halothane. We found that after addition of indomethacin (5 mg.kg-1), ventilation with three per cent O2 increased total resistance by 87 per cent over baseline with the increase primarily in the middle vascular segment. During normoxic ventilation PCRIT was 7.9 cm H2O and this increased significantly with hypoxia to 11.5 cm H2O). Only 2.0 per cent halothane blocked the increases in middle segment resistance and in PCRIT. We conclude that following cyclooxygenase blockade, halothane inhibits HPV by acting on middle segment vessels.\r"

During CPB, the nine patients studied were managed according to alpha-stat, temperature uncorrected, pH management. The mean +/- SD increase in CBF resulting from an increase in PaCO2 (1.35 +/- 0.5 ml.100 g-1.min-1.mmHg-1 PaCO2) was within the normal range, indicating appropriate CBF response to a change in PaCO2. There were no significant differences in CBF, being 25.7 ml.100 g-1.min-1 at a mean arterial blood pressure of 70 mmHg and 26.5 ml.100 g-1.min-1 at 110 mmHg, demonstrating intact cerebral autoregulation over this pressure range.

Both PETCO2-p and PETCO2-d accurately approximated PaCO2, however, the mean (+/- SD) arterial to end-tidal PCO2 difference (delta(a-ET)PCO2) was significantly greater with proximal (1.27 +/- 1.54 mmHg) than with distal sampling (0.64 +/- 1.64 mmHg) (P less than 0.01). In the subgroup of patients who weighted less than 12 kg, the delta(a-ET)PCO2 using proximal gas sampling (1.94 +/- 1.29 mmHg) was also significantly greater than it was using distal sampling (0.74 +/- 1.31 mmHg) (P less than 0.001). We conclude that although statistically different, both proximal and distal estimates of PETCO2 provide acceptable estimates of PaCO2 in healthy infants and children who are ventilated with a Sechrist infant ventilator and an Ayre's t-piece system.\r"

Distal sidestream PETCO2 and mainstream PETCO2 correlated with the PaCO2 (r2 = 0.66 and 0.61, respectively) within the range of 26-57 mmHg PaCO2. However, proximal PETCO2 with the sidestream capnometer correlated very poorly (r2 = 0.09) with PaCO2. The slope of the least square regression line for the distal sidestream capnometer, 0.67, was significantly less than that for the mainstream capnometer, 0.78 but both were significantly greater than that for the proximal sidestream capnometer, 0.39 (P less than 0.05). The slope of the regression for the proximal sidestream capnometer did not differ significantly from horizontal. Insertion of the mainstream sensor for the HP capnometer significantly increased the transcutaneous CO2 when compared with preinsertion values. We conclude that both distal sidestream and mainstream capnometry provide accurate estimates of the PaCO2 in critically ill neonates.\r"

Sixty-one patients undergoing craniotomy were studied; 20 controls (MED = 0) who had never received anticonvulsants and 41 epileptics in whom therapeutic plasma concentrations of either one (MED = 1), two (MED = 2), or three (MED = 3) different anticonvulsants were documented. During anaesthesia with 60-70 per cent N2O in O2 and 0.2 per cent isoflurane, a maintenance dose (MD) of fentanyl was administered using a continuous variable-rate IV fentanyl infusion, supplemented by intermittent 50 micrograms IV boluses. In order to define the minimal dosage of fentanyl required, the MD was titrated according to increases or decreases in the heart rate and/or mean arterial pressure exceeding 15 per cent of baseline ward values. A progressively higher fentanyl MD was required in the epileptic patients (MED = 1-4.3 +/- 0.5 microgram.kg-1.hr-1; MED = 2-5.4 +/- 0.6; MED = 3-7.6 +/- 0.6) compared with the control MD (MED = 0-2.6 +/- 0.5) (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that there appears to be a dose-effect relationship between the number of anticonvulsants received and the maintenance dose of fentanyl required during balanced anaesthesia.\r"

The activated state of IgA NP B lymphocytes has been proved by their higher OKIa (HLA-DR) positivities but lower IOB1a (CD 21, C3d-receptor) and decreased IgG-Fc-receptor (ox-rosette) expression. IgA NP B lymphocytes showed a higher IgA but also IgG and IgM polyclonal immunoglobulin production than control B lymphocytes in co-cultures with T lymphocytes. Not only regulatory T lymphocyte subsets but also serum derived from IgA NP patients stimulated the immunoglobulin production of IgA NP B cells.\r"

A low-nickel diet does not improve these patients but those treated with DSCG reacted better, from both objective and subjective point of view, than either the controls or the patients treated by diet. We next did intestinal permeability tests before therapy and after 15 days of treatment. We found that nickel uptake diminishes simultaneously with the reduction of absorption through the smaller aqueous \"pores\". This phenomenon was greatest after DSCG. We suggest that DSCG can help selected cases of pompholyx.\r"

There was no relationship between this abnormal airway responsiveness to metabisulfite and the degree of airway obstruction present, or the degree of airway reactivity as assessed by the response to inhaled bronchodilator or exercise testing. In a pilot study, we found that the administration of cromolyn sodium prior to metabisulfite challenge markedly attenuated the abnormal bronchoconstrictive response in nine of ten patients. We conclude that a metabisulfite-induced bronchoconstrictive response cannot be predicted on the basis of the degree of airway obstruction or airway reactivity and that pretreatment with cromolyn sodium may attenuate the abnormal response.\r"

In five stable patients with COLD (FEV1 = 0.9 +/- 0.21, mean +/- SE) with mild edema, during two weeks of a low sodium diet (one week on room air: pH = 7.39 +/- 0.02; PaO2 = 55 +/- 4 mm Hg; PaCO2 = 49 +/- 4 mm Hg; and one week on O2: pH = 7.38 +/- 0.01; PaO2 = 72 +/- 6 mm Hg; PaCO2 = 52 +/- 4 mm Hg) we monitored sodium balance, systemic and renal hemodynamics, plasma sodium and potassium, PRA, PA, and atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH). During air breathing, patients uniformly showed a depression of RPF despite normal cardiac output; plasma hormone levels did not differ from controls but there was elevation (greater than 2 SD above the normal mean) of PRA in four patients, PA in two patients, and ANH in two of five patients. During O2 breathing, urinary sodium increased significantly from 67 +/- 7 to 102 +/- 10 mEq/24 h. Surprisingly, the patients experienced a small but significant weight gain (0.6 +/- 0.1 kg). None of the other variables was affected by O2 therapy. The following conclusions were reached: in advanced COLD, correction of hypoxemia results in sodium diuresis, indicating that hypoxemia (in the presence of hypercapnia) contributes to sodium retention. The mechanism for this beneficial effect of O2 will require further investigation.\r"

Hypophosphatemia (Ps less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl) was found in 34 (21.5 percent) of 158 patients without differences between groups of COPD patients presenting increasing severity of respiratory illness. No relationship was found between serum levels and dietary intake of phosphorus; hypophosphatemia was associated with low renal phosphate threshold (TmPO4/GFR) values in 31 (91 percent) of 34 patients. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia was significantly higher among COPD patients taking one or more drugs commonly used in COPD and known as negatively influencing renal phosphate handling: xanthine derivatives, corticosteroids, loop diuretics, and beta 2-adrenergic bronchodilators. Short-term administration of therapeutic doses of these drugs in COPD patients previously not taking any drug reduced TmPO4/GFR values; phosphaturic effect of short-term theophylline administration on renal phosphate handling was additive to that of long-term assumption of the drug. Muscle phosphorus content was both reduced in COPD patients as compared with control subjects and significantly correlated to serum phosphorus levels and to TmPO4/GFR values. The present investigation revealed a high prevalence of hypophosphatemia among COPD patients as well as a defect in renal phosphate reabsorption secondary, at least in part, to pharmacologic therapy. Moreover, it also suggests that in COPD patients muscle phosphorus content is likely to be reduced in presence of hypophosphatemia.\r"

On PSG 1, the A + H/I for the group was 66.6 +/- 8.8 (mean +/- SE). During non-REM sleep the A + H/I on PSG 3 (29 +/- 10) was lower than it was on PSG 2 (54.3 +/- 11.3) (p = 0.004) and lower than that on PSG 1 (70.8 +/- 10.3) (p = 0.003). Similarly, during non-REM sleep, the AI on PSG 3 (16.1 +/- 7.4) was less than that on PSG 2 (39.1 +/- 10.4) (p = 0.003) and less than that on PSG 1 (41.7 +/- 9.6) (p = 0.015). In the eight patients in whom REM sleep was recorded on all three PSGs, there was no difference with respect to A + H/I or AI. The nadir of SaO2 during non-REM sleep was higher during PSG 3 than during PSG 1 (p = 0.002), but not different from that on PSG 2. There were no differences among the three studies with respect to REM-related nadirs of SaO2; however, there was a good deal of interindividual variability across the three PSGs. In general, individuals with satisfactory amelioration of sleep-disordered breathing on PSG 2 demonstrated similar improvement on PSG 3. Patients who did not have a substantial improvement in the early postoperative period often had improvement on PSG 3, but there was a good deal of interindividual variability in this regard. We conclude that PSG within a few days following UPPP is warranted in patients with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing to determine if there has been worsening of upper airway function or oxygenation (or both) during sleep in the early postoperative period. A satisfactory result early after UPPP suggests that a late postoperative PSG is unnecessary, with savings in cost and the convenience.\r"

Since HPTs are frequently given therapeutically to patients with ARDS, a serious concern clinically has been the possibility that platelet transfusions might worsen pulmonary function in such patients. To prospectively evaluate this issue, we assessed the effects of HPT on two parameters of pulmonary function: (1) Qs/Qt; and (2) PVR. Measurements were made immediately before and at 1 hour and 4 hours after HPT in 16 patients during 18 separate episodes of ARDS and in 11 control patients. The ARDS had been present for at least 48 hours in all patients at the time of study. Prior to HPT, patients with ARDS had significantly worse pulmonary function compared to control subjects. Although a small number of patients with ARDS had large changes in PVR and Qs/Qt after HPT, no group showed significant changes in any pulmonary parameter following transfusion. Neither individual changes in the platelet count after HPT nor the duration of ARDS before HPT was associated with changes in pulmonary function after platelet administration. We concluded that therapeutically required HPT did not significantly worsen pulmonary function at up to four hours after transfusion in this group of patients with well-defined and fully evolved (greater than 48-hour duration) ARDS. The reason for this absence of effect was not known, but the pathogenesis of ARDS might only be susceptible to alteration during the early developmental stage.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seven acutely ill ventilated patients were prospectively studied to ascertain the severity and frequency of alterations in gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters during brief bronchoscopy. Sedation was performed using midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) without topical anesthesia. An average decline in PaO2 of 26 percent was observed at the end of the procedure, compared to the baseline value, and this was associated with a mild increase in PaCO2 in spite of the use of a special adapter. Alterations in mean systolic blood pressure appeared to be modest, consisting of a 10 percent decrease from the control level, related to sedation, and a 10 percent rise from baseline during the procedure, associated with a concomitant mild tachycardia. At that time, central hemodynamic measurements performed in a subset of 31 patients showed a significant increase in cardiac output associated with higher pulmonary wedge pressure. Fourteen patients developed hypoxemia of less than 60 mm Hg on FIO2 adjusted to 0.8. Of the ten risk factors univariately associated with hypoxemia, only the presence of ARDS (p less than 0.001) and \"fighting\" the ventilator during the procedure (p less than 0.05) remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Attempts to prevent hypoxemia in critically ill patients should focus on inducing complete sedation, with careful attention to hemodynamic status, or providing maximal levels of oxygen to the ventilator (or both).\r"

Previously used laboratory parameters, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and increasing levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs), have failed to correlate consistently with hemorrhagic events and have not yet been useful in predicting patients at risk for bleeding. Although the bleeding time (BT) has been considered primarily to reflect platelet function, it also reflects the interaction of platelets with vessel wall and coagulation pathways. Recently, the BT has been considered as a potential predictor of clinical bleeding during thrombolysis. The BT, as a measure of in vivo hemostatic competence, may be particularly well-suited for this application. Serial BTs during thrombolytic therapy may provide valuable information regarding safety and efficacy, but further studies are needed to confirm preliminary findings.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), streptokinase (SK), and anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) have salutary effects on mortality when administered to patients with evolving acute myocardial infarction (MI). Studies suggest that intravenous rt-PA is more effective in reperfusing occluded infarct-related arteries than SK, and the results of ongoing studies directly comparing the influence of SK and rt-PA on mortality are awaited. The clinical role of agents such as APSAC, urokinase, and pro-urokinase, used alone or in combination, remains to be determined. It is evident that a variety of thrombolytic agents will be effective, and variables such as ease of administration, pharmacokinetics, fibrin specificity, effects on blood viscosity, and incidence of adverse effects need to be assessed to determine which agents are the most suitable for clinical use. There is an increased risk of bleeding at vascular puncture sites with all thrombolytic agents. Current indications for thrombolytic therapy include ischemic chest pain of at least 30 min duration that is unrelieved by nitroglycerin and is associated with ST-segment elevations of at least 0.1 mV in two contiguous electrocardiographic leads. Such therapy is usually reserved for patients less than 75 years old who are not at increased risk for bleeding and whose chest pain began less than 4-6 prior to treatment. Trials are under way to determine whether patients with shorter pain duration, transient ST-segment changes (ie, unstable angina patients), chest pain associated with ST-segment depressions or T-wave inversions (ie, non-Q-wave infarction patients), or patients whose pain began more than 4 to 6 h earlier will benefit from early thrombolytic therapy. Other factors such as patient age, the likelihood of the diagnosis of MI, and the estimated risk of bleeding should also be considered. The findings of available major randomized trials indicate that early invasive procedures are generally unnecessary and that meticulous care must be exercised in the selection and management of patients subjected to thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Aspirin therapy also decreases mortality as well as stroke and reinfarction in suspected evolving MI. The combined ability of both agents to lyse as well as to prevent clots yields a greater benefit than either alone. The use of aspirin with thrombolysis also protects against the increase in reinfarction observed when thrombolytic therapy is given alone. While ongoing research is evaluating the optimal thrombolytic agent as well as the possible role of heparin, it is already clear that the use of aspirin with thrombolytic therapy will significantly decrease reinfarction, stroke, and vascular mortality in suspected evolving MI.\r"

This prediction has been only partially confirmed in major clinical trials in which t-PA was given in the doses necessary for effective coronary thrombolysis. The risk of bleeding in patients receiving t-PA is correlated with increased levels of fibrin degradation products and hypofibrinogenemia, consistent with a link between systemic plasminemia and hemorrhage. Limiting t-PA-associated bleeding may therefore require measures aimed at decreasing hyperplasminemia. These measures include a short infusion of a high t-PA dose. This article presents new experimental evidence that has confirmed our previous results showing that a short infusion of t-PA is an effective and safe thrombolytic treatment.\r"

Animal experiments have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is increased and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. To determine whether a short course regimen of rt-PA has potential in man, we gave a bolus injection of rt-PA (0.6 mg/kg) concurrently with heparin to five patients with venous thromboembolism. Three patients with angiographically proven pulmonary embolism had marked improvement of the perfusion defects when lung scans were repeated 24 h after rt-PA administration. In one of two patients with thrombosis of the deep veins of the upper extremity the venographic defect resolved completely. In three of four patients there was a mild decrease in fibrinogen and a moderate decrease in alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. There was no excessive bleeding. These results suggest that a bolus injection regimen of rt-PA has considerable potential in the treatment of thromboembolic disease.\r"

Because changes in membrane fluidity and lipid composition are reported to influence activity of a number of liver enzymes, effects of parenteral and enteral nutrition on hepatic microsomal membrane fluidity and lipid composition were assessed and compared with hepatic mixed-function oxidase activity. Both parenteral and enteral hyperalimentation produced a significant decrease in microsomal membrane fluidity (fluorescence anisotropy = 0.155 +/- 0.003 in both experimental groups versus 0.129 +/- 0.003 for microsomes from chow-fed animals). However, meperidine demethylase activity was significantly decreased compared with chow-fed experiments only in hepatic microsomes from parenterally hyperalimented animals, whereas ethoxyresorufin deethylase activity was significantly reduced only in the enteral-nutrition group. Inclusion of lipid in the parenterally administered hyperalimentation solution normalized microsomal membrane fluidity and lipid profile to those of chow-fed animals but did not increase hepatic meperidine demethylation. Both parenteral and enteral nutrition produce significant changes in physical state and lipid composition of rat hepatic microsomal membranes, but these changes are not responsible for the altered hepatic drug metabolism observed during hyperalimentation.\r"

Six patients received pravastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Treatment with pravastatin resulted in a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol caused by a decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of 30% (p less than 0.005). We determined the effect of this medication on the lithogenicity of bile. Cholesterol saturation index of fasting gall bladder bile decreased with 23% (p less than 0.01) from 1.06 to 0.75 during treatment with pravastatin. A reduction of 24% (p less than 0.01) in molar percentage of biliary cholesterol was seen. After treatment the total bile acid excretion in faeces and the molar percentage of biliary bile acids were not significantly changed, suggesting that pravastatin does not influence bile acid biosynthesis to a significant extent. These findings indicate that treatment with pravastatin can decrease the incidence and complications of cholesterol gall stones.\r"

As demonstrated in Table 1, patients with headache had (on average) lower hospital resource utilization than patients in these same DRGs without a headache diagnosis. Headache patients had lesser total hospital costs, a lower severity of illness, and generated profits under DRGs compared to non-headache patients. We found that our headache patients were adequately reimbursed by the DRG hospital payment system and suggest that this could be a financially attractive population to hospitals.\r"

The study included a group of 15 adult subjects with asthma in a clinically stable state. The subjects all demonstrated mild to severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness (geometric mean provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) histamine, 0.57; range, 0.20 to 4.7 mg/ml). The first part of the study was a double-blind, 7-day trial of astemizole (10 mg/day) or placebo, assigned in random order for the first eight subjects. The seven subjects entering the trial subsequently were administered active medication only. PC20 histamine was assessed on the 3 consecutive days before starting the trial, on the last day of medication, 3 days later, and once a week thereafter until PC20 returned to baseline. PC20 methacholine was also assessed before the trial and regularly thereafter to ensure functional stability. No significant changes in PC20 histamine were documented in the placebo-treated group, but the four subjects receiving active medication demonstrated marked changes in PC20 histamine (from a tenfold to a greater than 100-fold difference) (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in changes in PC20 methacholine between the two treatment groups (p = 0.27). The duration of recovery of bronchial response to histamine in all 15 subjects ranged from 12 to 102 days (mean, 42 days) and was in some subjects, longer than the duration of the blocking effect of histamine reactivity found with skin testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two breaths of PAF (21 micrograms) were inhaled three times every 15 minutes and airflow at 30% of vital capacity from partial flow-volume curves (Vp30) was measured. PGI2 (4 ng/kg/min) had no effect on Vp30 or blood pressure, whereas heart rate increased from 70.3 +/- 3.9 to 73.7 +/- 4.0 beats/min (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01). Two subjects did not complete the study because of transient hypotension. PGI2 had no effect on PAF-induced bronchoconstriction with maximal decreases in Vp30 of 42.0 +/- 8.0% (p less than 0.01) during PGI2 and 49.8 +/- 14.2% (p less than 0.02) during diluent infusion. Ex vivo platelet aggregation to PAF (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) was significantly inhibited by PGI2. Circulating neutrophils decreased from 4.7 +/- 0.9 x 10(9)/L to 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(9)/L (p less than 0.05) 5 minutes after the first PAF inhalation during diluent infusion, whereas there was no significant change with PGI2. Thus, PGI2 does not influence PAF-induced bronchoconstriction in man despite causing marked inhibition of ex vivo PAF-induced platelet aggregation and preventing the fall of neutrophils.\r"

To assess the degree to which population-based socioeconomic characteristics are associated with hospital use, this study explored small-area variation in hospital discharges for gastrointestinal and liver (GI) Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Utilizing a 1980 Michigan database of 1.5 million discharges, we constructed age-adjusted, population-based discharge rates for the GI DRGs. We then evaluated the effect of poverty, defined by the percent of households in a hospital market community below the poverty line. Using regression techniques, we found that poverty explained 27.5% of the variation in GI hospital discharges, with the poor admitted more often (p less than 0.0001). Using cost weighted discharge rates as the dependent variable, we found that poverty explained 20.3% (p = 0.0003) of the variation in cost weighted discharges. These results suggest that poverty explains a significant amount of variation in hospital discharges and has a significant effect on associated small-area hospitalization costs in GI diseases. Practicing gastroenterologists and surgeons need to be aware of factors that influence patients utilizing their services in order to retain their role as patient advocates as changes in payment systems are suggested.\r"

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made with clinical, biological, and radiological data. We believe that the pancreatitis was related to the NANB viral infection, as they began simultaneously and other causes of pancreatitis were eliminated. Such an association has been reported mainly with hepatitis B and exceptionally with hepatitis A.

  ".W": "The role of cell-surface Schiff base-forming ligands in the inductive interaction between class II+ APC and murine T cells was investigated. Schiff bases are produced by the condensation of an amine with the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone in a reversible covalent reaction. Treatment of APC with low concentrations of glutaraldehyde to form Schiff bases on a small proportion of epsilon-amino groups consistently inhibited Ag presentation to primary T cells and T cell clones. Schiff base formation by glutaraldehyde was quantitated by specific reduction with the weak, selective reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride. Aldehyde inhibition of presentation was observed with allo-, protein, and small peptide Ag, and T cell clones of Th1 and Th2 subtypes were equally susceptible. Large increases in the concentration of glutaraldehyde in brief pretreatments of APC resulted in substantial restoration of Ag-presenting function. Oxidation of T cell sialic acid to produce cell-surface aldehydes resulted in a vigorous proliferative response to class II-positive syngeneic accessory cells. This response was inhibited by preformation of Schiff bases on epsilon-amino groups of the accessory cells by glutaraldehyde. Dose response curves for inhibition of aldehyde-induced and Ag-induced T cell proliferation by glutaraldehyde treatment of accessory cells were similar. Reduction of constitutive aldehydes on cloned T cells by sodium borohydride resulted in inhibition of Ag-specific responses. This took the form of a substantial delay in the time-course of the response consistent with the eventual regeneration of cell-surface aldehydes. Only the presentation of Ag was inhibited. Ongoing established proliferative responses remained unaffected. Together, these data indicate that constitutive Schiff base-forming ligands on APC and T cells are essential in Ag presentation to murine T cells and are consistent with a model of Ag presentation in which reciprocal Schiff base formation is an essential element.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated subsets of cells from human PBL and have investigated their abilities to mediate lysis targeted by bispecific antibodies. Targeted cytotoxic cells were divided into two distinct types based on buoyant density. The low buoyant density fraction contained all of the targetable cytotoxic activity in unstimulated PBL, including both T and K cells targeted with anti-CD3 and anti-Fc gamma RIII (CD16) containing bispecific antibodies, respectively. Both types of targetable cytotoxic cells required IL-2 for maintenance of cytotoxic activity, expressed the CD56 (NKH1) marker, and mediated MHC-unrestricted lysis. The targetable T cells in low density PBL were exclusively CD8+ and represented only about 2% of the total PBL. The high buoyant density lymphocytes, depleted of NK cells, had no targetable activity, but were able to generate over several days, targetable T cell activity in the presence of a TCR cross-linking signal plus IL-2. Unlike the low-density cells, the activated high buoyant density effector T cells did not express CD56, consisted of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and did not mediate MHC-unrestricted lysis. These cells proliferated more rapidly and generated more total lytic activity than the low-density fraction. Our studies show that targetable cytotoxic activity in human PBL is mediated by several subsets of cells with different activation requirements. Presumably all of these activities could be directed against unwanted cells in clinical or preclinical studies involving targeted cytotoxic cells.\r"

TE cell binding to activated and resting thymocytes was studied by using our previously described suspension assay of TE-thymocyte conjugate formation. We found that activated mature and immature thymocytes bound maximally at 37 degrees C to IFN-gamma-treated ICAM-1+ and HLA-DR+ TE cells and this TE-activated thymocyte binding was inhibited by antibodies to LFA-1 alpha-chain (CD11a) (68.1 +/- 5.6% inhibition, p less than 0.01) and ICAM-1 (73.9 +/- 7.7% inhibition, p less than 0.05). Neither anti-HLA-DR antibody L243 nor anti-MHC class I antibody 3F10 inhibited IFN-gamma-treated TE binding to activated thymocytes. As with antibodies to LFA-3 and CD2, antibodies to LFA-1 and ICAM-1 also inhibited PHA-induced mature thymocyte activation when accessory signals were provided by TE cells in vitro. Finally, LFA-1 and ICAM-1 were expressed early on in human thymic fetal ontogeny in patterns similar to those seen in postnatal thymus. Taken together, these data suggest that resting mature and immature thymocytes bind to TE cells via the CD2/LFA-3 ligand pair, whereas activated thymocytes bind via both CD2/LFA-3 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 ligand systems. We postulate that IFN-gamma produced intrathymically may regulate TE expression of ICAM-1 and therefore potentially may regulate TE cell binding to activated thymocytes beginning in the earliest stages of human thymic development.\r"

Injection of mice with a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgD antibody (GaM delta) stimulates large increases in the serum concentration of IgE through the production of IL-4. Neutralization of endogenous IFN-gamma production in GaM delta-injected mice leads to further increases in serum IgE levels. We show that IL-4 and IFN-gamma, produced after GaM delta injection, respectively, stimulate and inhibit the number of splenic B cells expressing Thy-1 in vivo. Increased numbers of Thy-1-expressing B cells are observed concomitantly with the onset of enhanced IgE secretion. These Thy-1-expressing B cells are highly and selectively enriched for IgE-secreting cells.\r"

HIV was subsequently reproducibly isolated in cell supernatants from all study participants (53 cultures from 42 individuals). Both autologous and allogeneic CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic HIV seropositive and healthy HIV seronegative individuals inhibited the replication of HIV in these cultures in a dose-dependent manner. CD8+ T cells from patients with AIDS showed reduced or no such inhibitory activity. The inhibitory effect was not dependent on direct cell-cell contact: an inhibitory effect was exerted by CD8+ T cells across a semipermeable membrane, and an inhibitory activity was also exerted by the cell-free supernatants from activated CD8+ T cells. These results suggest that activated CD8+ T cells secrete a soluble inhibitor of HIV replication.\r"

  ".W": "The interactions of alloreactive T lymphocytes with the vascular endothelium were studied in an in vitro model of lymphocyte adherence to cultured human arterial endothelial cell (HAEC) monolayers. Donor-primed lymphocytes (DPL) were shown to have significantly greater adherence to donor HAEC than were third-party primed lymphocytes. Limiting dilution analysis of adherent DPL showed an enrichment of donor-reactive lymphocytes compared with nonadherent DPL. This study examines the allospecific nature of this increased lymphocyte adherence. HAEC constitutively express class I HLA Ag and can be induced by IFN-gamma to express class II Ag. DPL adherence to class I+ HAEC was inhibited only in the presence of mAb directed against class I Ag. DPL adherence to class I+ and class II+ HAEC was inhibited in the presence of mAb directed against class I and class II Ag. Class I- and class II-specific adherence was also shown to involve CD8 and CD4 molecules, respectively, whereas lymphocyte function-associated Ag do not appear to play a major role in long term alloreactive lymphocyte adherence to HAEC. These findings suggest that alloreactive lymphocyte adherence to HAEC is mediated by two mechanisms. One is based on allorecognition, primarily of HLA Ag, and the other is related to presumably non-Ag-specific interactions between activated lymphocytes and the vascular endothelium. The studies presented provide evidence to suggest that HLA-specific lymphocyte adherence to endothelium may significantly contribute to the development of alloreactive lymphocyte infiltrates within the allograft.\r"

These manifestations are quite similar to those observed in mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced autoimmunity. The mechanism of the latter disease has been recently partly elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare DP and HgCl2-induced autoimmunity in BN rats and to compare the mechanisms involved in both situations. A transient increase in the number of spleen cells, affecting B cells and CD4+ T cells, and an increase in serum IgE concentration, previously reported in HgCl2-induced autoimmunity, were observed during DP treatment. Autoreactive anti-class II T cells able to proliferate not only in the presence of autologous B cells but also in the presence of syngeneic normal B cells were found in DP-treated BN rats. Spontaneous regulation occurred, associated with the disappearance of autoreactive T cells. Suppressor CD8+ T cells were not involved in this phenomenon. Mechanisms involved in both the induction and the regulation of DP-induced autoimmunity seem to be quite similar to those reported in HgCl2-induced autoimmunity.\r"

In this study, we have examined the capacity of astrocytes to secrete TNF-alpha in response to a variety of biologic stimuli, particularly cytokines such as IL-1 and IFN-gamma, which are known to be present in the central nervous system during neurologic diseases associated with inflammation. Rat astrocytes do not constitutively produce TNF-alpha, but have the ability to secrete TNF-alpha in response to LPS, and can be primed by IFN-gamma to respond to a suboptimal dose of LPS. IFN-gamma and IL-1 beta alone do not induce TNF-alpha production, however, the combined treatment of IFN-gamma and IL-1 beta results in a striking synergistic effect on astrocyte TNF-alpha production. Astrocyte TNF-alpha protein production induced by a combined treatment of either IFN-gamma/LPS or IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta occurs in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and appears to require a \"priming signal\" initiated by IFN-gamma, which then renders the astrocyte responsive to either a suboptimal dose of LPS or IL-1 beta. Astrocyte TNF-alpha production by IFN-gamma/LPS stimulation can be inhibited by the addition of anti-rat IFN-gamma antibody, whereas IFN-gamma/IL-1-induced TNF-alpha production is inhibited by antibody to either IFN-gamma or IL-1 beta. Polyclonal antisera reactive with mouse macrophage-derived TNF-alpha neutralized the cytotoxicity of IFN-gamma/LPS and IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta-induced astrocyte TNF-alpha, demonstrating similarities between these two sources of TNF-alpha. We propose that astrocyte-produced TNF-alpha may have a pivotal role in augmenting intracerebral immune responses and inflammatory demyelination due to its diverse functional effects on glial cells such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes themselves.\r"

The proliferation of these resting T cells showed both IL-2-dependent and -independent components as determined by the susceptibility of the response to the blocking effects of anti-IL-2 mAb. Furthermore, IL-7 was found to augment the Con A-induced production of IL-2 and expression of IL-2R by resting splenic T cells. In contrast, Con A blasts and long term, Ag-dependent cloned T cells proliferated in response to IL-7 independently of any involvement of IL-2. Finally, differences were observed between IL-7 and IL-6 with regard to the regulation of T cell growth and activation. As with IL-7, IL-6 stimulated resting splenic T cells to proliferate in the presence of comitogen. However, in contrast to IL-7, IL-6 failed to stimulate the proliferation of Con A blasts or T cell clones and did not augment the Con A-induced expression of IL-2R on resting T cells.\r"

  ".U": "90217510\r", 
  ".W": "Many cytokines (including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) have been shown to induce thymocyte proliferation in the presence of PHA. In this report, we demonstrate that certain cytokine combinations induce thymocyte proliferation in the absence of artificial comitogens. IL-1 alpha, IL-6, and TNF-alpha enhanced the proliferation of whole unseparated thymocytes in the presence of IL-2, whereas none of them induced thymocyte proliferation alone. In contrast, of these three enhancing cytokines, only IL-6 enhanced IL-4-induced proliferation. We also separated thymocytes into four groups based on their expression of CD4 and CD8, and investigated their responses to various cytokines. The results indicate that each cytokine combination affects different thymocyte subsets; thus, IL-1 alpha enhanced the proliferation of CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocytes more efficiently than IL-6 in the presence of IL-2, whereas IL-6 enhanced the responses of CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ single positive (SP) thymocytes to IL-2 or IL-4 better than IL-1 alpha. TNF-alpha enhanced the proliferation of both DN and both SP subsets in the presence of IL-2 and/or IL-7. None of these combinations induced the proliferation of CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes. Finally, DN were separated into CD3+ and CD3- populations and their responsiveness was investigated, because recent reports strongly suggest that CD3+ DN thymocytes are a mature subset of different lineage rather than precursors of SP thymocytes. CD3+ DN proliferated in response to IL-7, TNF-alpha + IL-2, and IL-1 + IL-2. CD3- DN did not respond to IL-7 or to IL-1 + IL-2, but did respond to TNF-alpha + IL-2. Finally, we detected TNF-alpha production by a cloned line of thymic macrophages, as well as by DN adult thymocytes. These results suggest that cytokines alone are capable of potent growth stimuli for thymocytes, and indicate that different combinations of these molecules act selectively on thymocytes at different developmental stages.\r"

Fc gamma R expression is regulated by IFN-gamma. Because IFN-gamma and IL-4 have antagonistic effects on the expression of the FcR for IgE on human monocytes, we studied the effect of IL-4 on Fc gamma R expression and function. We show that IL-4 down-regulates Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII expression of cultured monocytes and inhibits IFN-gamma enhanced Fc gamma RI expression. Exposure of monocytes to IL-4 for 40 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of the expression of all three Fc gamma R that persisted throughout the whole culture period (7 days). Anti-IL-4 antibodies completely reversed the IL-4 effect. In addition the impaired Fc gamma R expression correlated directly with reduced Fc gamma R-mediated function because monocytes cultured in the presence of IL-4 have a reduced capacity to lyse human E opsonized with human IgG anti-D or mouse antiglycophorin A antibodies. These observations, together with the previous finding that IL-4 induces Fc epsilon RIIb expression on monocytes, indicate that IL-4 and IFN-gamma may control the Fc gamma R-mediated immune response by differentially regulating Fc gamma R expression.\r"

  ".W": "We used highly purified human monocytes to study the regulation of cell surface and secretion of the low affinity FcR for IgE (Fc epsilon RIIb). IL-4 induces Fc epsilon RIIb expression and soluble Fc epsilon RIIb release in a dose-dependent manner. Significant levels of Fc epsilon RIIb expression were obtained after 12 h of incubation with IL-4 and maximal expression was observed between 24 to 48 h after which the expression declined. Surface expression was followed by secretion of soluble Fc epsilon RIIb which reached maximal levels after 3 to 4 days of incubation and which remained constant throughout 7 days of culture. Induction of Fc epsilon RIIb expression by IL-4 was completely blocked by anti-IL-4 antibodies. Furthermore, IL-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, low m.w. BCGF and also LPS all failed to induce Fc epsilon RIIb expression, demonstrating the specificity of the induction. Fc epsilon RIIb membrane expression induced by IL-4 was reduced in the presence of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. Strong inhibition of IL-4-induced Fc epsilon RIIb expression was observed at IFN-alpha concentrations of 450 U/ml (80%), and 100 U/ml of IFN-gamma reduced IL-4-induced Fc epsilon RIIb expression by 70%. Interestingly, soluble Fc epsilon RIIb release was strongly inhibited by IFN-alpha. In contrast, IFN-gamma did not affect soluble Fc epsilon RIIb release, suggesting that reduced membrane expression of Fc epsilon RIIb observed in the presence of IFN-gamma does not reflect inhibition of Fc epsilon RIIb expression but may represent enhanced cleavage or reduced anchoring in the membrane of Fc epsilon RIIb. Finally, IL-5 that has been shown to enhance IL-4-induced Fc epsilon RII on B cells does not enhance significantly IL-4-induced Fc epsilon RIIb membrane expression or subsequent soluble Fc epsilon RIIb release by monocytes. Taken together these results show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma have different regulatory effects on IL-4-induced Fc epsilon RIIb membrane expression and soluble Fc epsilon RIIb release by human monocytes.\r"

One Vk gene may represent a BALB/c equivalent of the VkOx2 subfamily and another is identical to a Vk used by anti-idiotypic antibodies from C57Bl/6 mice. When compared with known germ-line counterparts, all of the Vk sequences are close to germ-line configuration. In contrast, the germ-line counterparts for the anti-insulin VH genes are not known, however, they differ only in five to seven predicted amino acids from VH of other expressed antibodies. One antibody (mAb 123) differs in one amino acid in complementarity-determining regions 1 and 2 from the VH of the murine tumor BCL1, and another (mAb 126) employs an unmutated DFL16.1 germ-line D segment. These data suggest that antibodies binding autologous insulin use V gene components that are not extensively mutated, even when derived by immunization with heterologous insulin.\r"

The mechanisms of phorbol ester-induced down modulation of CD4 molecules, however, have not been elucidated. To determine how PMA down-modulates CD4 expression by T lymphocytes, we studied the ability of inhibitors of protein kinase C, calmodulin, actin, and tubulin to block PMA-induced modulation of CD4 in several murine and human cell types. We also tested the ability of intracellular and extracellular calcium chelators to block CD4 internalization. There was marked variability in the degree of PMA-induced down-modulation of CD4 among various cell types. The effects of PMA on CD4 expression were greater for murine thymocytes, for human PBL, and for the human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, MOLT-3, than for any of the other cell types studied. The protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, blocked phosphorylation but not internalization of CD4 molecules induced by PMA. Therefore, phosphorylation of CD4 molecules by protein kinase C is not required for the internalization of the molecules. Internalization was blocked by both inhibitors of calmodulin, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide, and trifluoperazine. PMA-induced internalization of CD4 was blocked by Quin-2 AM, which chelates intracellular calcium. EGTA, which chelates extracellular calcium, did not block internalization. Inhibitors of actin or tubulin did not block internalization. These results suggest that PMA-induced modulation of CD4 can occur in the absence of phosphorylation of the CD4 molecules and is calmodulin and intracellular calcium dependent.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of IL-1 mRNA in eosinophils from mice infected with larvae of the parasite Mesocestoides corti was investigated by in situ hybridization technique. S35 labeled cDNA probe for alpha IL-1, hybridized with mRNA in murine eosinophils and macrophages. After 6 h of LPS stimulation eosinophils were able to express mRNA in their cytoplasm. This expression was highly increased by the addition of indomethacine. The IL-1 mRNA expression in murine macrophages was higher than in eosinophils in LPS-stimulated cells. This difference was statistically significant, p less than 0.001. To test if eosinophils may produce and release IL-1 in the culture medium, we isolated these cells in a Percoll gradient. Cell preparations with a purity exceeding 94% were cultured with various stimuli and their supernatants were tested for IL-1 activity. Eosinophils produced 169.65 +/- 73 U/ml when stimulated with LPS (n = 14). A dose-dependent response was obtained when the eosinophils were in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187. Controls were performed to rule out the contribution of the contaminating population on the thymocyte proliferating activity. They were also used to detect other possible causes of interference in the assay, such as leukotrienes or TNF. IL-1 in supernatants was also detected using a conversion assay such as EL-4 thymoma cells. IL-1 activity was first detected in culture supernatants 18 h later, maximal production being in the first 24 h. In accordance with our hybridization results, an increase in IL-1 activity was obtained when eosinophils were stimulated with LPS and treated with indomethacine. The factor had a molecular mass between 16 to 20 kDa that corresponded to the described for murine IL-1. Inasmuch as IL-1 is an important mediator of inflammatory reactions this IL may enhance the proinflammatory action of eosinophils.\r"

Reaction of the 4 mAb with Western blots of the truncated recombinant proteins revealed two epitope specificities in the recognition of the 19-kDa protein. IT-10 was found to be dependent only on the presence of amino acids surrounding the first cysteine residue, whereas IT-12, IT-16, and IT-19 all required the presence of both the first and third cysteine residues. These two cysteine residues are separated by 135 amino acids, and are considered to be brought together by tertiary folding of the protein to form an assembled epitope for IT-12, IT-16, and IT-19. These three mAb demonstrated differing sensitivities to the modification of reduced 19-kDa protein using iodoacetamide: a treatment that should have prevented the reformation of disulfide bonds within the protein. This result suggests that, although IT-12, IT-16, and IT-19 appear to be specific for the same epitope, there are probably fine-specificity differences in this recognition. IT-10 was not sensitive to the absence of disulfide bonds within the 19-kDa protein, suggesting that the epitope is not conformationally sensitive, and is likely to be linear in nature.\r"

Thus, IFN-gamma is constitutively produced in mice, although in low quantities.

In spleens and livers of these mice, the numbers of cells synthesizing the lymphokine were increased and many were seen in foot tissue undergoing a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction after intraplantar inoculation of the virus. In contrast, few IFN-gamma-producing cells were found in the inflammatory infiltrates of leptomeninges and choroid plexus after intracerebral infection.\r"

We have previously reported that gut mucosal infection with reovirus stimulates the appearance of virus-specific cytotoxic T cell precursors (pCTL) in Peyer's patches (PP). The effectors that mediate reovirus-specific cytotoxicity were found to express both the Thy-1 and CD8 Ag and were MHC-restricted in their recognition of reovirus Ag. To further characterize the virus-specific precursor and effector cells we have analyzed PP cells for the expression of a novel surface Ag (termed germinal center and T cell Ag (GCT)) found on germinal center B cells and a subpopulation of CD8+ T cells. Gut mucosal infection with reovirus 1/L is capable of increasing the proportion of GCT+ CD8+ T cells in PP. Positive selection as well as depletion of GCT+ cells has demonstrated that pCTL can express this Ag, and depletion experiments have demonstrated that effector CTL express the GCT Ag. Thus, a subpopulation of GCT+ cells have been identified as Ag-specific precursor and effector CTL. These observations indicate that the expression of the GCT Ag may provide a means to identify recently stimulated pCTL or effector CTL in gut mucosal tissues.\r"

V beta 3.1 and 6 alleles differed between strains by a single amino acid, whereas V beta 1 and 10 alleles differed by 4 and 6 amino acids, respectively. The overall interhaplotypic V beta polymorphisms appeared to be limited when based upon compilation of this information and previously published V beta sequences. One application of these data was to attempt to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the recently reported allele-specific autoimmune disease, collagen-induced arthritis. Based on the present structural data and the additional evidence, contrary to what was suggested, the V beta 6 gene does not appear to be the sole participant in anticollagen responses.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we describe a novel functional cell surface molecule, designated as Kp43, which is expressed among leukocytes by NK cells, TCR-gamma/delta + T lymphocytes, and some CD8+ CD56+TCR-alpha/beta + T cell clones. The Kp43 Ag is a 70-kDa disulfide-linked dimer, which migrates in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as a single 43-kDa band. Two-color immunofluorescence staining of fresh PBL revealed that only a fraction of CD16+, and of TCR-gamma/delta + T lymphocytes expressed the Ag. The analysis of TCR-alpha/beta + T cell clones showed that a small proportion (2 out of 20) weakly expressed Kp43 together with the CD8 and CD56 molecules. By immunoperoxidase staining of different tissues the anti-Kp43, reactivity was detected exclusively in lymphoid organs, where a minority of scattered cells was stained, and in some liver sinusoidal cells. Essentially all NK cells acquired Kp43 when stimulated with a B lymphoblastoid cell line. By contrast, the pattern of distribution of Kp43 remained stable upon in vitro culture of T-gamma/delta lymphocytes, thus delineating two subsets according to its expression. In lymphokine-activated killer populations, obtained by culturing either PBL or NK cells with high concentration of IL-2, most CD16+ and CD56+ cells became Kp43+. The Kp43-specific mAb inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferative response of cultured NK and TCR-gamma/delta + T cells without affecting their non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. The partial inhibitory effect, which was mediated as well by pepsin digested F(ab')2 fragments, was lost upon reduction to Fab. The anti-Kp43 mAb did not interfere with the specific binding of IL-2 to its surface receptors. Altogether the data point out that the Kp43 dimer is involved in the regulation of the IL-2-dependent proliferative response of NK cells and a subset of TCR-gamma/delta + T lymphocytes.\r"

In order to determine whether specific peptides encoded by the cDNA could be used to raise antibodies against BP antigen, fusion proteins derived from fragments of the BP cDNA and 17-mer or 19-mer synthetic peptides, corresponding to its deduced amino acid sequence, were used to generate rabbit antibodies. Three restriction enzyme fragments, 1179 bp (5' end), 264 bp (middle), and 546 bp (3' end), of the 1992 open reading frame (ORF) of BP cDNA were subcloned in frame into pEX plasmids to make beta-galactosidase fusion proteins FP1, FP2, and FP3, respectively. Fusion proteins of the predicted molecular weight, and which bound anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies, were produced, confirming the length of the predicted ORF. Rabbits immunized with FP1, but not FP3, produced antibodies, similar to authentic antibodies from BP patients, which: 1) bound the epidermal basement membrane at titers over 10,000, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence; 2) bound the basement membrane on the roof of 1 M NaCl-split skin; 3) immunoprecipitated the 230-kD BP antigen; and 4) bound the hemidesmosome, as determined by immunoelectron microscopy. Rabbits immunized with FP2 also produced lower titer BP-like antibodies. We further showed that short hydrophilic synthetic peptides, contained in FP1, could induce similar BP-like antibodies in rabbits at immunofluorescence titers up to 2560. These rabbit antibodies should prove useful for further studies on the function and structure of particular epitopes of BP antigen as well as on the pathophysiology of disease.\r"

Results demonstrate that differentiating epidermal cells are characterized by time-dependent changes in polyamine concentrations. An early polyamine catabolic phase, characterized by increased total putrescine concentration and drastic reduction of both spermidine and spermine levels, is followed by active spermidine biosynthesis. The differences in putrescine and, in particular, spermidine metabolism are reflected in a time-dependent modulation of protein-bound polyamine derivatives. In fact, upon addition of calcium to the culture medium, hypusine N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyllysine) is rapidly reduced to undetectable levels. The very low hypusine level is paralleled by an increase in gamma-glutamyl putrescine derivatives and followed by a large increase in gamma-glutamyl spermidine derivatives; in addition, there is a remarkable concomitant biosynthesis of transglutaminase-catalyzed mono and bis gamma-glutamyl spermidine derivatives and epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links. The effect of TPA and RA on hypusine formation is also reported.\r"

These are challenging our ability to evaluate them thoroughly and rapidly. Zidovudine (AZT) remains the mainstay of anti-HIV-1 drugs. Recent controlled trials indicate it should be used early in infection (in those with CD4 cell counts less than 500/mm3) and in lower doses (500-600 mg/day). Prolonged AZT treatment in patients with AIDS, however, is often associated with viral resistance. Newer reverse transcriptase-inhibiting nucleoside derivatives are currently in phase II-III clinical trials. Other HIV-1 replicative sites under attack in clinical studies include binding and entry of virus, envelope protein glycosylation, and viral assembly and release. Agents that target HIV-1 proteinase, integrase, ribonuclease H, and products of regulatory genes such as tat are under development. Combination therapies that target different viral replicative sites likely will allow use of individual agents below their toxic concentrations and help prevent drug resistance. Innovative programs for expanded access to experimental drugs are needed that will permit expeditious clinical trials, optimize the gathering of useful information, and permit the widest access to promising treatments.\r"

The relationship between the IgG antibody concentration and the light chain composition of the specific antibody directed to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide was also assessed in 62 of 215 serum samples with detectable Hib antibody. The IgG Hib antibody concentration was strongly correlated with the kappa:lambda Hib antibody ratio (r = .60, P = .001), and this correlation was independent of age.

In a 2- to 4-year prospective study, patients with recurrent infections who received monthly prophylactic long-acting penicillin were significantly protected from subsequent neisserial infection compared with those who did not receive penicillin (P = .02, Fisher's exact test). Heterogeneous susceptibility to neisserial infection was confirmed by following C6-deficient patients who presented with one or no Neisseria meningitidis infections. These patients, on no prophylaxis, had significantly fewer infections (P = .004) than did patients who presented with recurrent disease. Functional C6 activity was restored by transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in a C6-deficient patient resistant to conventional antibiotic treatment. Antibody levels to the serotype 2 outer membrane proteins were significantly elevated in C6-deficient patients compared with control groups (P = .001).\r"

The specific PCR product was obtained with input DNA from 11 different strains of M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis and one strain of Mycobacterium simiae. No product was detected with DNA from 28 strains of the Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonei, and Mycobacterium gordonae. The PCR product was detected by gel electrophoresis after 30 cycles using 1 fg of input DNA. Amplification of this sequence may provide the basis for an assay to detect M. tuberculosis directly in clinical material.\r"

In a univariate analysis, levels of TNF (P = .002) and IL-1 beta (P = .05) were associated with the patient's outcome, but not IFN alpha (P = .15) and IFN gamma (P = .26). In contrast, in a stepwise logistic regression analysis, the severity of the underlying disease (P = .01), the age of the patient (P = .02), the documentation of infection (nonbacteremic infections vs. bacteremias, P = .03), the urine output (P = .04), and the arterial pH (P = .05) contributed more significantly to prediction of patient outcome than the serum levels of TNF (P = .07). After 10 days, the median concentration of TNF was undetectable (less than 100 pg/ml) in the survivors, whereas it remained elevated (305 pg/ml, P = .002) in the nonsurvivors.

To determine if the efficacy of IFN-gamma immunotherapy could be enhanced by continuous delivery, Leishmania donovani-infected mice were treated using a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 10(5) or 10(6) units of IFN-gamma inhibited the replication of L. donovani within liver macrophages but overall did not reduce liver parasite burdens. In contrast, a comparable dose of IFN-gamma (2.4 x 10(5) units/day) administered continuously induced an enhanced effect and reduced liver burdens by almost 50%. Although pump delivery did not similarly increase the efficacy of antimony chemotherapy in infected mice, continuous treatment with IFN-gamma plus antimony produced an additive antileishmanial effect. These results suggest that continuous infusions of macrophage-activating lymphokines such as IFN-gamma (used alone or in combination with chemotherapy) may be required to optimize in vivo antimicrobial effects.\r"

There were fewer cancellations in the 6FSH cycle, but similar numbers of preovulatory oocytes were retrieved, fertilized, and transferred.

We have examined the effects of several potential modulators of this reaction, including phospholipids, von Willebrand factor, and factor IXa, all of which bind factor VIII. Our results indicate that neither resting nor stimulated platelets nor phospholipid vesicles protect factor VIII from inactivation by activated protein C in either the presence or the absence of protein S. However, the addition of von Willebrand factor decreases the inactivation of factor VIII by activated protein C by 20% to 30%, and factor IXa, which is known to protect factor VIII from inactivation by activated protein C, confers additional protection with von Willebrand factor. The active site of factor IXa is necessary for the protective effect, because native factor IX and active site-inhibited factor IXa do not protect factor VIII from inactivation. Thus there is an additive protective effect when von Willebrand factor and factor IXa are present with factor VIII, leading to a decrease in the inactivation by activated protein C. These factors may be particularly important in stabilizing factor VIII in the circulation and during the early stages of coagulation.\r"

  ".W": "A suppression of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and its metabolites in malignant pheochromocytoma by metyrosine was associated with an increase in tyrosine, plasma DOPA, and sulfate esters of DOPA and dopamine, followed, with continuing metyrosine administration, by a further rise of both DOPA sulfate and dopamine sulfate. Urinary dopamine progressively increased in the course of metyrosine treatment, and this, along with the increase of the dopamine metabolite, dihydroxyphenylethanol, and plasma dopamine sulfate, occurred in the absence of any change in plasma dopamine. The octopamine metabolite para-hydroxyphenylglycol, which was initially elevated at least 10-fold, also increased after metyrosine treatment. The unexpected increase of DOPA (progressively more converted toward DOPA sulfate) in the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition and increase in tyrosine may result from channeling the excess tyrosine toward DOPA and melanin through tyrosinase. Increases in plasma dopamine sulfate and urinary dopamine suggest that dopamine sulfate may be generated via DOPA sulfate and urinary dopamine may originate from circulating DOPA. Tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition may thus result in DOPA generation in non-catecholamine-producing tissues by an alternative pathway. The resulting progressive increase in DOPA and its sulfate may lead to increased urinary dopamine. DOPA sulfate may be an alternative source of dopamine sulfate.\r"

Neutrophils from rats maintained on a diet supplemented with EFA to 10% of the energy content--the high EFA (HEFA) group--showed a significantly higher LA concentration (but similar arachidonic acid content) compared with neutrophils from control rats maintained on a standard diet with 3% of the energy content as EFA. The HEFA group showed a significantly higher neutrophil oxidative metabolism compared with controls in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), but this response was equal to control values when stimulated by ionophore A23187, sodium fluoride, or phorbol myristate acetate. Similarly, FMLP conferred a more pronounced increase of intracellular Ca2+ in HEFA neutrophils, whereas this response to ionomycin was equal to that in controls. In contrast, HEFA rat neutrophil migration was decreased to 71% of the value in controls in response to FMLP. Similar results were observed for aggregation responses. On A23187 stimulation, HEFA and control neutrophils generated equal amounts of leukotriene B4 and other 5-lipoxygenase products as well as thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. However, assessment of binding of FMLP labeled with tritium revealed an increase of the low affinity state of the FMLP receptor population. Thus an increased intake of one unsaturated fatty acid, LA, leading to its accumulation in neutrophils, conferred alterations in formyl-peptide-elicited responses, not associated with the formation of the assessed arachidonate-derived mediators, but most likely through the observed modulation of FMLP receptor subpopulations.\r"

Plasma samples of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity were obtained for the assay. The dietary pattern was determined using a food frequency questionnaire, according to which the subjects were grouped as high, low or medium consumers. The subjects who were high consumers of fruit, vegetables, and root vegetables showed the lowest levels of PAI-1, those who were low consumers had the highest levels, whereas the medium consumers showed intermediate values. The tPA levels did not differ between the three groups, and there were no significant differences in other variables that covaried with PAI-1 levels, such as age, anthropometric variables, or serum lipid levels, which could confound the PAI-1/food pattern relationship. The data, which show that a frequent intake of fruit, vegetables, and root vegetables--foodstuffs rich in vitamin C and fibre--is associated with lower PAI-1 levels, are consistent with increased activity of the fibrinolytic system and thus a reduced risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular disease in subjects who exhibit this food intake pattern.\r"

Using stepwise selection multiple logistic regression analysis, the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I/B (odds ratio = 0.38, 95% confidence limits 0.24-0.61) was the only statistically significant association of CAD in women, after adjusting for the effects of age, body mass index, and histories of smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes. When stratified by median of total cholesterol, the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I/B was the most strongly associated with the presence of CAD in the lower half of the total cholesterol distribution (less than 208 mg/dl), whereas in the upper half of the total cholesterol distribution the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio was more strongly associated with CAD. None of the variables studied was associated with CAD in men. These results support other studies suggesting that apolipoproteins may be better predictors of CAD.\r"

The %Fat and %Prot also increased significantly, but the %CHO significantly decreased. Preoperatively, in the patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, there was a greater increase in %Prot in eight patients classified (according to Fischer) as having a Group 3 or 4 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on computerized tomography than in five patients classified as having a Group 1 or 2 SAH. In summary, increased metabolic expenditure, especially increased catabolism of protein and fat, is characteristic of accompanying hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, and there is an increase in consumption of fat and protein in the postoperative period. Lack of precise knowledge about the cause and consequences of these metabolic responses makes it impossible at present to judge the optimal extent of nutritional replacement. The hypermetabolic state should be taken into consideration when caring for these patients as it may cause weight loss, poor wound healing, and susceptibility to infection.\r"

Extended body clearance and biodistribution studies were performed in mice. The solutions to be injected were obtained by eluting generators with a 0.9% NaCl solution at pH 1. The pH of these eluates was adjusted to 5-9 with succinate, phosphate, lysine or NaOH solution. Our results demonstrate that the biologic behavior of these generator eluates is significantly dependent on the agent used for pH adjustment. Buffering with lysine leads to the best results: (a) the mice show no adverse reaction after injection of 150 human doses and the body clearance is very rapid and (b) more than 75% I.D. at 24 hr postinjection. Preliminary calculations based on these results suggest a significant decrease in the estimated patient radiation dose when lysine buffered 191Os/191mIr generator eluates are used for radionuclide angiography.\r"

When adoptively transferred to tumor-bearing hosts concurrent with the administration of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), TILs can mediate significant regression of tumor. To examine whether expression of class I major histocompatibility complex on tumor cells influenced the generation and antitumor activity of TILs, we used clones of murine B16BL6 melanoma either transfected with or lacking the class I gene Kb to generate TILs at a high dose (1,000 U/mL) or at a low dose (20 U/mL) of human rIL-2. TILs grew from both tumors in high-dose rIL-2, but they grew from the class I-expressing tumor only in low-dose rIL-2. TILs from the class I-deficient tumor did not lyse any target tested in vitro, nor did they demonstrate any therapeutic effect in vivo on established tumors that lacked or expressed class I. In contrast, TILs from the class I-expressing tumor specifically lysed the tumor of origin in vitro and caused it to regress in vivo. Further, these TILs demonstrated activity in vitro against the non-class I-expressing melanoma treated with the combination of murine recombinant interferon gamma and human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha; in vivo, when administered with recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha, TILs from the class I-expressing tumor mediated regression of non-class I-expressing pulmonary metastases, presumably by augmenting class I expression.\r"

  ".U": "90219098\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical studies using biological response modifiers in cancer therapy have shown that the major dose-limiting toxic effects are hypotension and diffuse microvascular leakage. The cause and pathophysiology of this hypotension remains unknown. Previous experiments have demonstrated that a number of cell types, including endothelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, can secrete a potent hypotensive agent--endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which has recently been identified as nitric oxide. In this study, we tested interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, muramyl dipeptide, and endotoxin for their effects on production of nitrogen oxides by endothelial cells. Interferon gamma, in combination with tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 (IL-1), or endotoxin, induced murine brain endothelial cells to secrete nitrites (20-45 microM within 48 hr), which are breakdown products of nitric oxide. Nitrite production was blocked by incubation of endothelial cells in medium without L-arginine, a substrate for nitric-oxide synthase. Accumulation of nitrites was also inhibited by addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme. The inhibitory effects of L-NMMA were reversed by addition of excess L-arginine. These results suggest (a) that endothelial cells produce nitric oxide in response to immunomodulators and (b) that endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide plays a role in the development of hypotension in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor or interleukins. Furthermore, administration of substrate analogues such as L-NMMA may favorably alter the toxicity associated with these immunomodulators and result in a higher maximum tolerated dose, with subsequent improvement in the antitumor activity.\r"

To determine whether endotoxin (LPS) released in the burn wound contributes to this response, the metabolic rates and colonic temperatures of male Sprague-Dawley rats were monitored before and for 1 week after thermal injury. Wounds were seeded with non-virulent P. aeruginosa (NVP), or S. epidermidis (SE) or were left unseeded at the time of injury. Non-bacteremic SE-seeded rats were as hypermetabolic as the NVP-seeded animals on postburn days (PBDs) 3-4 and 7-8, indicating that wound LPS is not an obligatory mediator of postburn hypermetabolism. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of NVPlps (2.6 and 12.6 micrograms/100 gm/hr) beneath unseeded burn wounds did not raise metabolic rates above those of burned, unseeded controls. Neither NVP seeding nor LPS infusion resulted in measurable endotoxemia on PBDs 7-8. These results indicate that the LPS released in the colonized burn wound does not serve as either a circulating mediator or the principal inducer of other mediators of postburn hypermetabolism in rats.\r"

Other proteins, such as Hageman factor (factor XII), showed diffuse adsorption patterns. Physiologically significant proteins that have not been well studied, such as immunoglobulin G and factor VIII, adsorbed readily to the surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. This finding may be significant since adsorbed proteins may activate coagulation mechanisms and immunologic responses, including platelet and monocyte adhesion and activation. Any human blood protein for which an antibody has been developed can be studied by use of this technique.\r"

Medicare costs for the oldest old may increase sixfold by the year 2040 (in constant 1987 dollars). It is unlikely that these projected increases in health care costs will be restrained solely by cost-containment strategies. Successful containment of these health care costs will be related to our ability to prevent and/or cure those age-dependent diseases and disorders that will produce the greatest needs for long-term care.\r"

Group 1 consisted of 14 children who were within a year of their CNS insult; they were underweight for age, but had normal length as well as weight for length. Within 6 months of initiating enteral tube feedings, most children in this group had normalized their weights. Group 2 consisted of 27 children who were within 8 years of their CNS insult; they were stunted and were underweight for both their age and their length. Within 6 months of initiating enteral feeds, the group increased both weight and weight for length to near normal, but their gains in length reached a plateau at 90% of ideal for age. Group 3 consisted of 10 children who were more than 8 years after their CNS insult. This group was severely malnourished but had some improvement in their weight for age and for length but, length for age showed no significant change. We conclude that the earlier adequate nutritional management of children with severe cerebral palsy is initiated, the more readily the nutritional deficits will reverse.\r"

Since variations in dietary protein and/or lipid have previously been shown to produce alterations in liver and gut drug metabolism, effects of five commonly used enteral nutrition regimens on several drug metabolic parameters were assessed in rats. Study formulations included: 1) Vivonex: low protein -no lipid; 2) High Protein Vivonex: normal protein -no lipid; 3) Vital: normal protein -normal lipid; 4) Sustacal: high protein -high lipid; 5) Isocal: normal protein -high lipid. Hepatic and intestinal microsomes were prepared after a continuous 7-day intragastric infusion of one of the formulations, and measurements of cytochrome P-450 content and assays of drug metabolizing activity were performed. No differences in intestinal microsomal cytochrome P-450 content or meperidine demethylase activity were seen among the various alimentation groups. However, significantly decreased amounts of cytochrome P-450 and reduced meperidine demethylase and pentobarbital hydroxylase activity were present in hepatic microsomes of animals receiving the lipid-poor Vivonex and High Nitrogen Vivonex preparations compared to the other alimentation groups. These data suggest that the composition of enteral nutrition formulations may significantly impact on hepatic function and specifically that the presence of lipid in such preparations may be important for maintaining normal levels of hepatic drug metabolism.\r"

The results were compared with those of eight control infants of the same age receiving orally a normal milk diet with an intake of 660 +/- 260 mg/kg/24 hr of linoleic acid and 101 +/- 35 mg/kg/24 hr of alpha-linolenic acid, or 4.5 +/- 0.7% and 0.7 +/- 0.3%, respectively, of total energy intake. Although their EFA intake was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) and administered only parenterally, after 1 to 4 months the infants receiving TPN still had a membrane phospholipid FA pattern of adipose tissue which was not significantly different from that of normal children of the same age. In stored adipocyte TG, the percentage of linoleic acid was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in infants receiving TPN. This is probably of nutritional importance as at this stage of life the child builds up its stores of EFA. The proportion of the other fatty acids in adipocyte TG was not significantly modified.\r"

Ten patients age 17 to 24 (mean 21.4 years) received 1000 kcal/M2 of a low (Pulmocare), medium (Ensure Plus), and high (Vivonex HN) carbohydrate formula in random order. Eight patients had severe, and two moderate obstructive pulmonary disease; nine used nighttime oxygen therapy. Basal energy expenditure (BEE) without feedings averaged 120% of that predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation. The metabolic expenditure by indirect calorimetry during nighttime feedings was 25 to 36% greater than the BEE. Oxygen consumption (VO2) increased 21 to 27% during nighttime feedings with no difference between formulas. VCO2 increased 29% for Pulmocare, 46% with Ensure Plus, and 53% with Vivonex HN. The increase in VCO2 with Pulmocare was significantly less than Ensure Plus (p less than 0.05) and Vivonex HN (p less than 0.005). The respiratory quotient (RQ) (VCO2-/VO2) for Pulmocare (0.88) was the same as the BEE, but increased with Ensure Plus (1.00), and Vivonex HN (1.08). The 41% increase in minute ventilation with Vivonex HN was greater than the 25 to 28% increase observed for Pulmocare and Ensure Plus (p less than 0.05). Transcutaneous oxygen saturation fell no more than 2% with all formulas. PCO2 changed +/- 5 torr during enteral feedings with similar changes in any patient with all formulas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The intraindividual day-to-day variations of nitrogen intake, excretion, and retention were analyzed in 23 parenterally fed newborn infants (birth weight: 785-2630 g). Nitrogen retentions measured over 3 consecutive days were highly correlated (r = 0.90-0.96), and the reliability for a single 24-hr collection was estimated by r1 = 0.93. Nitrogen balance data obtained over a 24-hr period are reliable for the purpose of clinical investigations, provided the nutrient intake is constant.\r"

Approximately 1 x 10(8) total cells of Escherichia coli B. were challenged to the upstream site of the filter. The test solution of 5% dextrose in water, 0.9% saline, Paremental A (A basic solution for total parenteral nutrition (TPN), a TPN solution in use in our clinic were infused continuously up to 168 hr and flow rate was maintained at 83 ml/hr. The effluents were analyzed using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test to detect endotoxin and also passage of the challenged bacteria was tested at 24-hr intervals over 168 hr. The results were as follows: (1) The viability control culture showed the presence of viable bacteria throughout the 168-hr period of the experiment. (2) During the experiments, all filters produced sterile effluents. (3) LAL assay indicated that only the effluents from the ELD96 contained no detectable endotoxin for 168 hr.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups based on etiology of dysphagia (central neurologic vs local mechanical dysfunction). All patients on admission exhibited marked malnutrition with an average weight loss of 12 +/- 9.8% body weight, serum transferrin 165 +/- 60.1 mg/dl, and albumin 3.2 +/- 0.85 mg/dl. All patients were placed on either enteral (63%) or parenteral (37%) nutrition. Twenty-seven percent of all patients suffered a complication of nutritional therapy. Patients with nasoenteric tubes had a 10% complication incidence (aspiration or endotracheal placement of tube) resulting in a 30% mortality rate; significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than seen with other modalities. Any form of upper enteric feeding (nasoenteric or gastrostomy) was associated with significantly increased (p less than 0.01) risk of aspiration pneumonia. It is concluded that patients admitted to hospital with dysphagia as the major complaint suffer from severe malnutrition, and that upper gastrointestinal intubation should not be employed for feeding until the dysphagia has resolved.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g were randomly divided into two groups with six rats in each group. Control consists of rats whose small intestines were transected but anastomosed. Resected rats had 70% of their small intestine removed. After intestinal resection and transection, rats were infused with a balanced TPN solution for 17 days. Resected rats excreted significantly more calcium than transected rats during the first 10 days of TPN infusion. Peak excretion occurred between day 3 and 4 followed by a trend toward a slightly higher than normal level of calcium excretion between days 10 and 17. Urinary losses of phosphorus and magnesium were not influenced by bowel resection. Plasma and tibia calcium, phosphorus and magnesium levels were not altered. The effects of small bowel resection on urinary calcium loss is specific and our data demonstrate the involvement of gut in regulating urinary calcium excretion and suggest that gut may play a significant role in TPN induced metabolic bone disease.\r"

  ".W": "Several rat bioassays were conducted to evaluate protein quality and lysine (LYS) bioavailability (BIO) of Osmolite HN, a commercial enteral product, as affected by the severity of heat processing during sterilization and by storage of the products for 1 year. Without amino acid supplementation, the protein quality of Osmolite HN, as determined by protein efficiency ratio (PER), was lower than that of casein, regardless of heat treatment. With addition of the limiting amino acid, cystine, the PER of Osmolite HN was equivalent to that of cystine-fortified casein. Storage of the product for 1 year had no effect (p greater than 0.05) on PER, even though the products had darkened in color. Slope-ratio regression analysis (weight gain regressed on supplemental LYS intake) yielded a LYS BIO estimate of 94.4% for the Osmolite HN control relative to crystalline LYS. Partitioning weight gain into that resulting from LYS consumed in the basal diet and that resulting from the LYS supplement per se provided more accurate estimates of LYS BIO. This method estimated LYS BIO at 100% for the Osmolite HN products, regardless of heat treatment. With storage, LYS BIO decreased 11-12% in all of the Osmolite HN products. The decreased LYS BIO is of minimal nutritional significance in that overall protein quality of the products was not affected by storage. This is likely due to the fact that there is a plethora of lysine in Osmolite HN such that LYS is not a protein-quality limiting factor.\r"

Significantly enhanced recovery of vitamin A was found with the polyolefin tubing compared to that of the polyvinyl chloride under all conditions tested. After 24 hours under the varied conditions of the study, vitamin A availability ranged from 47 to 87% with polyolefin and 19 to 74% with polyvinyl chloride. These differences may be expected to result in significantly greater vitamin A delivery from polyolefin compared to polyvinyl chloride tubing to patients treated in neonatal intensive care units.\r"

The amount of fat was 0.1 g/kg of body weight injected within 32 +/- 4 sec and the lipid clearance was determined over 40 min. The fractional removal rates k for the three different emulsions of fat were 5.38 +/- 1.67, 4.95 +/- 2.15, 3.92 +/- 1.31 %/min, respectively (mean +/- SD), and the half-life time of clearance T1/2 were 14.5 +/- 5.8, 16.9 +/- 7.4, 19.2 +/- 5.2 min, respectively. The highest fat particles values were observed 5 min after the bolus and all concentrations remained within the normal range (0-3 g/liter) during the study. In addition, no adverse effects were observed throughout the IVFTT. The nonparametric analysis of variance (Friedman's test) showed no significant differences between groups, even if Lipovenos 20% tended to be cleared more slowly than Intralipid 20%. These results suggest that the three fat emulsions are similarly eliminated from the blood stream and do not result in acute intolerance. Further studies based on prolonged infusion should be carried out to determine whether the two new emulsions might be alternatively used for intravenous nutritional support.\r"

The pediatric multiple vitamin (PMV) preparation was removed from the PN formula and the formula was infused without incident. The patient was maintained on PN and an oral vitamin supplement with no further complaints. Inadvertent administration of a PN solution containing PMV resulted in a recurrence of hives. Absence of any adverse reactions when the PMV preparation was removed from the PN solution and an allergic reaction when the multivitamin was added to the PN solution support the possibility that the allergic reaction was related to the infusion of the multiple vitamin preparation.\r"

Inter-sinus gradients for ACTH (range 3.3-18.2) and AVP (2.0-375) correctly lateralised the microadenoma in seven of these patients. One additional patient showed an increased gradient for AVP but not ACTH on the side of the tumour. The correlation between the AVP and ACTH concentrations in the petrosal sinus draining the microadenoma was significant. Petrosal sinus plasma concentrations of prolactin and growth hormone were also significantly higher on the side of the tumour than on the non-tumour side. Evidence against a non-specific tumour effect on the secretion of all pituitary hormones was the fact that in most cases the gradients for LH and FSH were not significant. It is proposed that increased delivery of AVP to part of the pituitary may result from an aberrant blood supply, and that AVP may interact with corticotropin releasing factor to promote tumour growth and ACTH release.\r"

  ".W": "Each year, infectious gastroenteritis causes greater than 210,000 children in the United States to be hospitalized and 4-10 million children to die worldwide. Since the mid-1970s, knowledge has increased dramatically concerning the viral agents that are responsible for much of this public health burden. Rotavirus, the most common cause of diarrhea among children, infects virtually every child in the United States by the age of 4 years and causes potentially lethal dehydration in 0.75% of children less than 2 years of age. Other recently identified pathogens include the enteric adenoviruses, calicivirus, astrovirus, and the Norwalk family of agents. Conclusive diagnosis of these viruses requires electron microscopic examination of stool specimens, a laboratory technique that is available only at a few large centers, including CDC. Stool samples from an outbreak that are submitted to CDC for detection of viral pathology should be collected in bulk from 10 ill persons during their first 48 hours of illness, while feces are still liquid, and should be stored at 4 C (not frozen). Acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples should be collected from the same persons, plus from an equal number of controls, during the first week of illness and 3 weeks thereafter. Control measures for outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis should focus on the removal of an ongoing common source of infection (e.g., an ill food handler or the contamination of a water supply) and on the interruption of person-to-person transmission that can perpetuate an outbreak in a population after the common source has been removed. Because improvements in environmental hygiene may not be accompanied by reductions of endemic diarrhea caused by viruses, immunization may play an important role in future control; vaccine trials for rotavirus are in progress. In anticipation of vaccine development and use, CDC recently began national surveillance for the viral agents of gastroenteritis. Health-care facilities involved in the detection of rotavirus or the other viral agents of diarrhea can participate.\r"

They were then observed for an additional four weeks after the drug or placebo was discontinued. Treatment with misoprostol was associated with a significant improvement in renal function as judged by the mean (+/- SEM) serum creatinine concentration (128 +/- 7 vs. 158 +/- 11 mumol per liter after 12 weeks; P = 0.03) and creatinine clearance (84 +/- 6 vs. 69 +/- 5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; P = 0.05). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of acute rejection in the group treated with misoprostol as compared with the placebo group (10 of 38 vs. 20 of 39; P = 0.02), and there was less need for rehospitalization after transplantation (4 +/- 1 days with misoprostol vs. 10 +/- 2 days for placebo; P = 0.03). Although blood levels of cyclosporine did not differ significantly between the groups, they tended to be higher in the misoprostol group, as did the incidence of acute nephrotoxicity due to cyclosporine (13 of 38 vs. 8 of 39). Infectious complications tended to be fewer in the misoprostol-treated group (14 of 38 vs. 21 of 39). We conclude that misoprostol improves renal function and safely reduces the incidence of acute rejection in renal-transplant recipients treated concurrently with cyclosporine and prednisone.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive bone loss in osteoporosis results from bone resorption in excess of bone formation. We conducted a double-blind study in 66 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis of therapy with etidronate, a diphosphonate compound that reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. The patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive oral etidronate (400 mg per day) or placebo for 2 weeks, followed by a 13-week period in which no drugs were given. This sequence was repeated 10 times, for a total of 150 weeks. Daily oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was given throughout the study to both groups. Vertebral bone mineral content was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry; spinal radiographs were assessed to identify new vertebral fractures. Vertebral bone mineral content increased significantly (P less than 0.01) after 150 weeks of etidronate therapy (5.3 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 8.6; n = 20) but decreased with placebo (-2.7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -7.3 to 1.9; n = 20). The difference between groups was 8.0 percentage points (P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 13.6). The rates of fracture were significantly different for the period from week 60 to week 150 between the etidronate and placebo groups (6 vs. 54 fractures per 100 patient-years; P = 0.023). No adverse clinical, biochemical, or bone histomorphometric effects of treatment were observed. We conclude that at the end of nearly three years, etidronate therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis results in significant increases in vertebral bone mineral content and, after approximately one year of treatment, a significant decrease in the rate of new vertebral fractures.\r"

  ".U": "90220803\r", 
  ".W": "2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) is a purine analogue that after intracellular metabolic conversion suppresses the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study of ddI in 17 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 20 patients with AIDS-related complex. The drug was administered twice daily over a dose range of 0.4 to 66 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for 2 to 44 weeks. The maximal tolerated oral dose of ddI was estimated to be 12 mg per kilogram per day. The major dose-limiting toxic effects were a painful peripheral neuropathy (in eight patients) and pancreatitis (in five). Asymptomatic elevations of the serum aminotransferase levels (in 13 patients) and the serum urate level (in 10) were also noted, but there was no dose-related hematologic toxicity. At the maximal tolerated dose, the peak plasma levels of ddI were 6.3 to 9.6 mumol per liter 0.6 to 1 hour after oral administration; the mean plasma half-life was 1.5 hours. The administration of ddI was associated with statistically significant decreases in serum level of p24 antigen and increases in the numbers of CD4 cells at 2, 6, 10, and 20 weeks. These changes were seen at all dose levels studied. Either a clinical improvement or a weight gain of greater than or equal to 2 kg was observed in 25 of 34 patients at six weeks. We conclude that ddI is a promising therapeutic agent in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. Its efficacy is currently being evaluated in large-scale, controlled clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a Phase I open-label trial of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) for the treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and severe AIDS-related complex. A single daily dose of ddI was administered orally to 34 patients (17 with AIDS and 17 with AIDS-related complex) for a median of 12 weeks (range, 2 to 56). We studied six dose levels from 1.6 to 30.4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. Of the 17 patients previously treated with zidovudine, 13 had had hematologic side effects. The maximal tolerated dose of oral ddI was estimated to be 20.4 mg per kilogram per day. Pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy were the major dose-limiting toxic effects. Other toxic effects included elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, abnormalities in cardiac conduction, rash, and asymptomatic elevations in serum urate levels and the creatine kinase fraction from skeletal muscle. Treatment with ddI was associated with an increase in the mean number of CD4 lymphocytes from 125 per cubic millimeter at base line to 182 per cubic millimeter after 10 weeks (P = 0.005). There were also increases after 12 weeks in the mean total lymphocyte count (from 0.8 to 1.2 x 10(9) per liter) and the mean hemoglobin level (from 12.9 to 14.1 g per deciliter) (both P less than 0.01). The amount of human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen decreased by more than 50 percent in 14 of 19 patients with detectable antigen. No differences in response were observed between patients previously treated with zidovudine and those never treated with the drug. We conclude that ddI has antiretroviral activity in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex and that the toxicity of ddI differs from that of zidovudine. However, controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of ddI.\r"

Here we show that a CD4 immunoadhesin can mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) towards HIV-infected cells, although, unlike natural anti-gp120 antibodies, it does not allow ADCC towards uninfected CD4-expressing cells that have bound soluble gp120 to the CD4 on their surface. In addition, CD4 immunoadhesin, like natural IgG molecules, is efficiently transferred across the placenta of a primate. These observations have implications for the therapeutic application of CD4 immunoadhesins, particularly in the area of perinatal transmission of HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in pregnant ewes have demonstrated that intravenous (IV) cocaine produces increased maternal blood pressure and vasoconstriction of the uterine arteries, resulting in decreased uterine blood flow and decreased fetal oxygen levels. To determine whether these responses to cocaine were mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, cocaine was administered to four pregnant ewes before and after phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride, an alpha 1 receptor antagonist. Before phenoxybenzamine infusion, cocaine 2.0 mg/kg produced a 53% increase in maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP), a 50% reduction in total uterine blood flow, and a 191% increase in uterine vascular resistance. Cocaine also increased fetal MAP by 24%, increased the fetal heart rate (FHR) by 51%, and reduced fetal PO2 by 29%. Alpha 1 receptor blockade after phenoxybenzamine 5.0 mg/kg was confirmed by a lack of change in uterine blood flow to IV norepinephrine 30 micrograms before cocaine administration. After phenoxybenzamine, cocaine produced no increase in maternal or fetal MAP. However, total uterine blood flow decreased 44%, uterine vascular resistance increased 59%, FHR increased 36%, and fetal PO2 fell 18%. Because the fetal responses mimicked the maternal responses to cocaine both before and after phenoxybenzamine, phenoxybenzamine apparently crossed the placenta to block fetal alpha 1 receptors as well. Alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation is the major mechanism for the maternal and fetal hypertensive responses to cocaine. Although cocaine produces uterine artery vasoconstriction primarily by alpha 1 adrenergic receptor stimulation, its vasoconstrictive effects may involve other vasoactive neurotransmitters, such as dopamine or serotonin.\r"

Serum relaxin concentrations were quantified in women with resorbing ectopic gestations (as documented by declining titers of beta-hCG). The control group consisted of individuals with intrauterine pregnancies. As an additional control, we studied pregnancies conceived through ovulation induction, which usually have an increased volume of relaxin-secreting luteal tissue. On days 39-70 of gestation, the mean serum relaxin concentrations were significantly lower in ten resorbing ectopic gestations (P less than .001, permutation test) than in the normal control group of 13 intrauterine pregnancies. The median serum relaxin concentrations in patients who had ovulation induction with Pergonal were substantially higher than the median for all normal controls; values in clomiphene citrate-treated patients were within the normal range. These data suggest that relaxin secretion correlates with luteal function in both normal and abnormal gestations and reflects the status of the pregnancy. Thus, relaxin may serve as a useful clinical marker.\r"

Twenty-five infertile women with tubal or male factor infertility with a good response to hMG served as controls. Ninety-two percent of low responders had antibodies to FSH and 65% had antibodies to LH when assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Similarly, 77% of low responders had ovarian antibodies. No hepatic antibodies were found in the sera of low responders, indicating that the positivity was not a general interaction with cell components. None of the \"good responders\" had antibodies to gonadotropins or to ovarian or liver tissue. The significant differences in antibodies between the groups supports a possible immunologic cause for low ovarian stimulation response to gonadotropin.\r"

The authors analyzed the medical and economic implications of alternative screening strategies for detecting retinopathy in a diabetic population. The approaches compared included dilated fundus examination at 6-, 12-, and 24-month intervals with and without fundus photography. Potential savings from screening and treatment are based on amounts paid by the federal government for blindness-related disability. Screening for and treating retinopathy in patients with type I diabetes mellitus was cost-effective using all screening strategies. Between 71,474 and 85,315 person years of sight and 76,886 and 94,705 person years of reading vision can be saved for each annual cohort of patients with type I diabetes mellitus when proper laser photocoagulation is administered. This results in a cost savings of $62.1 to $108.6 million. Annual examination of all diabetic patients and semi-annual examination of those with retinopathy was more effective than annual examination with fundus photography. This screening strategy is consistent with the Preferred Practice Pattern for Diabetic Retinopathy of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\r"

In primary cultures of canine mucopolysaccharidosis type VII retinal pigment epithelial cells, which contain large amounts of undegraded glycosaminoglycan substrates, vector correction restored normal processing of specific glycosaminoglycans in the lysosomal compartment. In canine mucopolysaccharidosis type VII bone marrow cells, beta-glucuronidase was expressed at high levels in transduced cells.

Introduction of kanamycin-resistance cassettes and deletion-subcloning experiments involving various open reading frames in the HindIII-BamHI fragment have localized the algR3 gene, which encodes a 340-amino acid polypeptide. This highly basic regulatory protein contains 17% lysine and 36% alanine. The predicted amino acid sequence shows no significant similarity with any bacterial proteins and yet is highly similar to the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus histone H1 subtype of protein. Promoter localization by reverse transcriptase mapping of the algR3 gene shows the presence of Escherichia coli sigma 70 recognition sequences, and coupled transcription/translation experiments in E. coli demonstrate the presence of a 39-kDa polypeptide encoded by the cloned algR3 gene.\r"

  ".U": "90222142\r", 
  ".W": "The motility of human neutrophils, which is of vital importance for the role of these cells in host defense, is based on rapid and dynamic changes of the filamentous actin F-actin) network. Consequently, to understand how neutrophils move and ingest particles, we need to know how polymerization and depolymerization of actin are regulated. Previous studies by several investigators have, based on indirect evidence obtained with pertussis toxin, suggested a role for GTP-binding protein(s) (G protein) in chemotaxis-induced, but not phagocytosis-induced, reorganization of the F-actin network. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of directly activated G proteins (i.e., without prior ligand-receptor complex formation) on the F-actin content in human neutrophils. AlF4- induced a pronounced and sustained increase in F-actin in intact neutrophils. This effect coincided with an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, indicating that phospholipase C and the subsequent transduction mechanism were also activated. Inhibition of phospholipase C activity by extensive depression of the cytosolic free Ca2+ level (less than 20 nM) only marginally affected the AlF4(-)-induced rise in F-actin content. The major part of the AlF4(-)-induced rise in F-actin content was also resistant to pertussis toxin, suggesting that pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in neutrophils are also able to trigger actin polymerization. The specificity of AlF4- in activating G proteins was also tested in permeabilized cells. In this case the effect was more rapid and could be totally abolished by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate. In analogy, in permeabilized cells guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate mimicked the effect of AlF4- on actin polymerization, and the effect induced by this nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue could also be totally abolished by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate. In summary, the present data support our previous hypothesis that G proteins are intimately linked to actin polymerization in human neutrophils.\r"

The PA/plasmin system has also been implicated in degradation of specific components of the muscle fiber basement membrane after local activation of plasminogen. These results suggest that neural regulation of muscle extracellular matrix metabolism accompanies or precedes regeneration after injury and is mediated by activation of PAs. In the present study, we have used nerve crush to explore the neural regulation of muscle PA activities directly after subtotal axon interruption and during the process of reinnervation. Muscle contraction after nerve stimulation and estimation of choline acetyltransferase activity were used to monitor reinnervation. Within 24 hr of nerve crush, muscle urokinase (but not tissue PA) activity rose in soluble and membrane-bound muscle fractions, as shown by an amidolytic assay and a fibrin zymography. Membrane-bound activity was 5-fold higher than cytosol activity, but there was no shift between cellular compartments during the time course of denervation. Coincident with the return of choline acetyltransferase activity and muscle contractility, muscle urokinase returned almost to baseline levels. These results show tight regulation of muscle urokinase levels by some neural influence.\r"

These results demonstrate that iodination did not destroy the specificity or activity of the antibody. This technique should be applicable to the large number of fluoresceinated antibodies that are commercially available. Thus, this strategy provides a simple way to rapidly prepare a large number of targeted phototoxic agents that can be used for the selective destruction with light of nearly any type of tissue or organism.\r"

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the amino acids involved in metal coordination and analyzed the consequence of altering the proposed zinc-finger structures on DNA binding. Disruption of the metal binding ability of the second zinc finger, FII, dramatically reduced target DNA binding. In contrast, when the postulated Zn(II) ligands of FI were mutated, the DNA binding activity was only slightly affected. DNase I protection studies showed that the FII is involved in the specific recognition of a DNA strand break. These results demonstrate that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contains a type of zinc finger that differs from previously recognized classes in terms of both structure and function.\r"

Here we show that endonucleolytic degradation of DNA is an intrinsic activity of DTx and also of the crossreactive mutant protein CRM197. Assays using DNA-impregnated gels as well as linear and supercoiled DNA in solution revealed not only that CRM197 has nuclease activity but also that its specific activity is actually significantly greater than that of the wild-type molecule. Since CRM197 contains a single amino acid substitution that renders it incapable of ADP-ribosylation, we propose that the active sites for ADP-ribosyltransferase and nuclease activities are distinct.\r"

Sequence analyses of these clones showed that they encode a 343-amino acid protein (named RTA). The RTA gene is single copy, as demonstrated by restriction mapping and Southern blotting of genomic clones and rat genomic DNA. Sequence analysis of the genomic clone further showed that the RTA gene has an intron interrupting the region encoding the amino terminus of the protein. RTA RNA sequences are relatively abundant throughout the gut, vas deferens, uterus, and aorta but are only barely detectable (on Northern blots) in liver, kidney, lung, and salivary gland. In the rat brain, RTA sequences are markedly abundant in the cerebellum. RTA is most closely related to the mas oncogene (34% identity), which has been suggested to be a forebrain angiotensin receptor. We cannot detect angiotensin binding to the RTA protein after introducing the cognate cDNA or mRNA into COS cells or Xenopus oocytes, respectively, nor can we detect an electrophysiologic response in the oocyte after application of angiotensin peptides. We conclude that RTA is not an angiotensin receptor; to date, we have been unable to identify its ligand.\r"

  ".W": "The light-chain locus of chicken has 1 functional V lambda 1 gene, 1 J gene, and 25 pseudo-V lambda-genes (where V = variable and J = joining). A major problem is which somatic mechanisms expand this extremely limited germ-line information to generate many different antibodies. Weill's group [Reynaud, C. A., Anquez, V., Grimal, H. & Weill, J. C. (1987) Cell 48, 379-388] has shown that the pseudo-V lambda-genes diversify the rearranged V lambda 1 by gene conversion. Here we demonstrate that chicken light chains are further diversified by somatic point mutations and by V lambda 1-J flexible joining. Somatic point mutations were identified in the J and 3' noncoding DNA of rearranged light-chain genes of chicken. These regions were analyzed because point mutations in V lambda 1 are obscured by gene conversion; the J and 3' noncoding DNA are presented in one copy per haploid genome and are not subject to gene conversion. In rodents point mutations occur as frequently in the V-J coding regions as in the adjacent flanking DNA. Therefore, we conclude that somatic point mutations diversify the V lambda 1 of chicken. The frequency (0-1%) and distribution of the mutations (decreasing in number with increased distance from the V lambda 1 segment) in chicken were as observed in rodents. Sequence variability at the V lambda 1-J junctions could be attributed to imprecise joining of the V lambda 1 and J genes. The modification by gene conversion of rearranged V lambda 1 genes in the bursa was similar in chicken aged 3 months (9.5%) or 3 weeks (9.1%)--i.e., gene conversion that generates the preimmune repertoire in the bursa seems to level off around 3 weeks of age. This preimmune repertoire can be further diversified by somatic point mutations that presumably lead to the formation of antibodies with increased affinity. A segment with structural features of a matrix association region [(A + T)-rich and four topoisomerase II binding sites] was identified in the middle of the J-C lambda intron (where C = constant).\r"

We have characterized the superstructure of one repeated gene family, the ribosomal gene family of Drosophila melanogaster, by a combination of recombinational and molecular analyses of spacer-length variants. The resulting genetic maps demonstrate that some spacer variants are widely dispersed, while others are limited in their distribution. Moreover, exchange among ribosomal DNA (DNA encoding rRNA) arrays was often unequal, leading to a prediction of little or no relationship between physical location in an array and relatedness of gene family members. Extensions of our procedure may be generally useful for mapping the superstructure of repetitive DNA.\r"

We have investigated whether PAF formation is important for the subsequent generation of icosanoids and superoxide anions by these cells. The generation of prostacyclin and leukotriene B4 were measured by radioimmunoassay, superoxide anion was measured by reduction of cytochrome c, and PAF was measured by bioassay. In each cell type, PAF formation preceded or accompanied icosanoid generation. Bradykinin-induced prostacyclin generation in endothelial cells was markedly reduced by the PAF receptor antagonists WEB 2086 or CV 6209. In guinea pig adherent macrophages in vitro, basal prostacyclin generation and that induced by endotoxin and fMet-Leu-Phe were inhibited by either WEB 2086 (1-100 microM) or CV 6209 (0.1-10 microM). In isolated rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes, fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated the generation of both leukotriene B4 and superoxide anion. WEB 2086 and CV 6209 caused concentration-dependent inhibition of both these markers of leukocyte activation. These observations lead us to suggest that PAF may be a second messenger in leukocytes and endothelial cells.\r"

Occupied sites of the mobile elements were detected by in situ hybridization on the salivary gland chromosomes sampled from 40 AW and 30 JH lines. The rates of insertion and excision of the copia and two copia-like elements, 412 and 17.6, are very low: Insertions occurred at up to 10(-3) per second chromosome per generation (17.6) and excision occurred at about 10(-5) per site per generation (copia and 412). Insertions of the I and hobo elements occurred much more frequently. These estimates are not only important for assessing the actual rate of various types of mutations but also for developing an evolutionary theory of mobile elements themselves.\r"

Only patients with an acute uraemic episode requiring dialysis and/or with serum creatinine levels above 600 mumols/l were included. The age of patients increased from median 41.25 years in the 1950s to 60.5 years in the period 1980 to 1988. The case-mix also altered with a decline in obstetric and traumatic disease, both of which carried an excellent prognosis, and an increase in the number of elderly patients with complicated medical and surgical conditions. Survival significantly decreased with increasing age and in the presence of complicating factors such as sepsis or malignancy. Despite these changes, there has been a progressive improvement in survival from 48.8 per cent in 1956-1959 to 57.9 per cent in 1985-1988. Survival for medical and surgical cases has improved from 38.5 per cent in 1956-1959 to 57.9 per cent in 1985-1988 (overall survival for non-obstetric cases was 44.2 per cent), due to improved prognosis for acute renal failure in general and acute renal failure due to intrinsic renal disease in particular.\r"

The technique has not been extensively evaluated in patients who are severely ill and receiving total parenteral nutrition, although the study of these patients with non-morphine-augmented hepatobiliary scintigraphy is problematic. The authors retrospectively analyzed 51 morphine-augmented hepatobiliary studies performed in a tertiary referral center on a population with a high proportion of severe intercurrent illness (18 patients, 14 of whom were receiving total parenteral nutrition) and hepatocellular dysfunction (eight patients). The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 69%, and the false-positive rate was 40% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The majority of the false-positive cases occurred in the severely ill subgroup (false-positive rate, 60%). Morphine-augmented hepatobiliary studies may be advantageous because of shortened imaging time. However, patients who have severe intercurrent illness, whether or not they are receiving total parenteral nutrition, have a higher frequency of false-positive morphine-augmented hepatobiliary studies, and positive findings at scintigraphy in this patient group should be interpreted with caution.\r"

There was a significant reduction in individual fibroid volumes at 3 months (P less than .05) and at 6 months (P less than .005) in the drug group, whereas there was no significant change in the placebo group. Vessel conspicuity significantly decreased at 3 months (P less than .02) and at 6 months (P less than .01) in the drug group but not in the placebo group. In the patients with endometriosis, there was a significant decrease (P less than .0006) in the number of endometriomas visualized. Significant changes were also noted in the pelvis in women who were receiving the GnRH analog. After 6 months of therapy, the identifiability of the ovaries was significantly poorer (P less than .05). The authors conclude that the utility of conservative therapy with a GnRH analog can be quantitatively assessed with MR imaging.\r"

This distribution is the same as that previously determined for the L7 protein by immunohistochemistry.

A transmembrane form is the predominant product generated in wheat germ (WG) extracts, whereas a completely translocated (secretory) form is the major product synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL). An unusual topogenic sequence within PrP is now shown to direct this system-dependent difference. The actions of this topogenic sequence were independent of on-going translation and could be conferred to heterologous proteins by the engineering of a discrete set of codons. System-dependent topology conferred by addition of RRL to WG translation products suggests that this sequence interacts with one or more cytosolic factors.\r"

A multistage model of the treatment process was developed. Data from retrospective studies in Malmo were used. The costs for health care and production loss were calculated and applied to the time profiles of the three screening alternatives. Health care costs as well as costs in loss of production increased with the introduction of the conventional clinical screening program. However, when the clinical screening was combined with the moire technique, the costs were markedly reduced. Thus, the combined clinical moire screening would be the cost-effective way of using resources to prevent scolioses from developing into a more severe deformity.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator on hemorrhagic transformation early after middle cerebral artery territory ischemia was studied in an established awake nonhuman primate (baboon) model. Following 3 hours' occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and 30 minutes' reperfusion in each of 30 baboons, a 60-minute infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (at three doses: Group A, 0.3 mg/kg, n = 6; Group B, 1.5 mg/kg, n = 6; Group C, 10 mg/kg, n = 6) or normal saline (n = 12) was undertaken. The frequency and volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, the volume of infarction, and clinical alterations were determined by computed tomography at 24 hours and 10 days, neuropathology at 14 days, and serial daily neurologic evaluations, respectively. Peripheral (nonintracranial) hemorrhage (Group A, p = 0.46; Group B, p = 0.015; Group C, p = 0.002) and peak plasma tissue plasminogen activator levels varied directly with the dose of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Petechial hemorrhagic infarction was a common finding among the 30 baboons. No significant differences in the incidences or volumes of infarction-related hemorrhage were apparent in any group compared with the respective saline-treated baboons. In pooled data, no significant relation between the volume of hemorrhage and the volume of infarction could be established. We conclude that the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic transformation are not related to infarction size and that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator does not increase the incidence or severity (volume) of hemorrhage when given early (less than or equal to 3.5 hours) after the onset of focal cerebral ischemia in this model.\r"

We evaluated two fibrinolytic agents, an analogue of tissue plasminogen activator (Fb-Fb-CF, the catalytic fragment of the tissue plasminogen activator molecule with a prolonged serum half-life, n = 10) and streptokinase (n = 7), in a rabbit model of embolic stroke. Both agents were given 3 hours after stroke onset, a time relevant to the clinical setting. Fb-Fb-CF was significantly better (p less than 0.04) than saline (n = 7) in restoring blood flow to previously occluded intracranial arteries, but streptokinase was ineffective. Neither fibrinolytic agent was associated with a substantial risk for intracerebral hemorrhagic side effects. Our study demonstrates that Fb-Fb-CF can safely and effectively reperfuse rabbit intracranial arteries 3 hours after occlusion, while streptokinase does not.\r"

Function of islets from human pancreas stored for longer than 18 hours after UW in situ flush was uniformly poor. 4.
