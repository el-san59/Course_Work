  ".W": "24 infants consecutively treated with acyclovir or vidarabine for neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis were followed up for 6 months to 3 years to assess neurological and developmental outcome. 15 patients had HSV-2 and 9 had HSV-1 encephalitis. Infants with HSV-2 encephalitis presented with a higher frequency of seizures, greater pleocytosis and protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, and more frequent evidence of structural damage on computerised tomographic scans of the brain than did those with HSV-1 encephalitis. 1 patient died. All 9 HSV-1 patients were normal at follow-up (mean 19.4 months) compared with only 4 (23%) of the 14 surviving HSV-2 infected infants (p = 0.003). Among infants with HSV-2 encephalitis, 50% became microcephalic; 57% had seizure disorders; 64% had ophthalmological defects; 64% had cerebral palsy; and 57% had mental retardation. Infants with neonatal HSV-1 encephalitis treated with systemic antiviral chemotherapy have excellent neurological outcomes; the neurological morbidity of those with HSV-2 encephalitis is still high.\r"

All 31 samples from patients with immunoglobulin-A (IgA) nephropathy, 1 of 12 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 1 of 5 with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) showed mesangial staining with cytomegalovirus antiserum, whereas no sample from 37 patients with other forms of glomerulonephritis was positive. Antigens of herpes simplex virus I were demonstrated in samples from 4 of 31 patients with IgA nephropathy, 1 of 12 patients with SLE, 1 of 5 patients with HSP, and 1 of 37 patients with other glomerular diseases. The consistent finding of glomerular cytomegalovirus antigen in IgA nephropathy suggests but does not prove that the virus has a role in the aetiology of this disorder.\r"

All the mothers of the thyrotoxic babies had both these TSH receptor antibodies in their serum. However, most of the mothers whose thyroid function had been well controlled in pregnancy gave birth to normal babies. 15 babies had a transient syndrome of low serum thyroxine (T4) and free T4 with normal TSH and this tended to be associated with TSH receptor antibodies in maternal serum (TBII 9/15, TSAb 4/15). 2 infants had transient hyperthyroxinaemia without hyperthyroidism and both their mothers showed strong TSAb activity without TBII activity.\r"

U urealyticum was isolated from 6 infants with severe intraventricular haemorrhage and from 3 with hydrocephalus. In 4 babies multiple isolations were made over several weeks. There were clinical features of congenital infection with major neurological impairment in 1 infant infected with M hominis. Diagnosis is difficult because these organisms cannot be seen on gram stain and cannot readily be cultivated on routine bacteriological media, and CSF pleocytosis may be absent. This study, which used appropriate mycoplasmal media, shows that U urealyticum and M hominis are the most common microorganisms isolated from the CSF of newborn infants in a high-risk population.\r"

For acute osteomyelitis caused by staphylococci, streptococci, H influenzae, or other gram-negative bacteria the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 24, 23, 17, and 22.5 days, respectively. Osteoarthritis usually had to be treated for about a month. 180 patients received large dosages of oral antimicrobials after clinical stabilisation with intravenous treatment, the median duration of intravenous therapy being about a week (range up to 7 weeks). 99% of patients underwent needle aspiration for diagnostic reasons. 36%, 71%, and 63% of the patients with acute suppurative arthritis, osteomyelitis, and osteoarthritis, respectively, underwent incision and drainage. Recurrence occurred in 4 patients with acute osteomyelitis (3.8% of cases). There was no recurrence of arthritis.\r"

Total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume decreased significantly with total nasal occlusion and with surgical relief of chronic nasal obstruction. All three volumes increased with interdental wiring. It is concluded that these effects are a result of changes in oronasal resistance: lung volume is enlarged by an overall increase in resistance and diminished by a decrease in resistance. These findings imply that the resistance to expiration provided by the nose helps maintain lung volumes and so may indirectly determine arterial oxygenation.\r"

Peak IgA, IgG, and IgM production by PBL occurred on day 7 after the start of vaccination. Peak antibody secretion by PBL occurred several days earlier than the serum antibody peak. All volunteers showed a specific PBL antibody response, but serum or intestinal immune responses, when demonstrable, were highly variable. Peak PBL IgA antibody response correlated with degree of rise in IgA antibody in serum (p = 0.00098) and the intestinal fluid (p = 0.0024). The assay is a useful means of measuring humoral immune response at a mucosal surface after local administration of antigen.\r"

In each extended family, atopy was vertically transmitted, and 31 of 47 (66%) offspring of marriages between atopic and unaffected parents were atopic. Of the designated atopic subjects, 83% admitted to symptoms suggesting atopic disease but only 30% regarded themselves as having any such disorder. It is suggested that atopy, the propensity to produce IgE in response to common, usually inhaled, allergens, is inherited as an autosomal dominant character but that its clinical expression depends on interaction with other factors.\r"

  ".W": "Photodynamic damage to normal tissues, including skin, appears to occur by photooxidative damage to the normal microvasculature as the primary target sensitized by HPD bound to the vascular wall or endothelial cell. Initial damage to the microvasculature was measured by the increase in vascular permeability (VP) as measured by Evans Blue dye (EB) extravasation as a function of HPD and laser light (632 nm) dose. Albino, Swiss-Webster mice (female 122-25 g, 5 mice per group) were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with incremental doses of HPD (Photofrin II, Photofrin Medical, Inc.) (1, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg). After 48 hours the left ear of each mouse was masked as a control and the right ear was irradiated at 632 nm using the Aurora-Lexel Argon-dye laser (Cooper Laser Sonics, Inc.) with an intensity of 50 mW/cm2 and light doses of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 J/cm2 directed to a 3-mm spot on the mouse ear. No EB leakage occurred in the absence of HPD at any light dose or in the absence of light at any HPC dose. Vascular permeability increased as a function of HPD dose up to 30 mg/kg. AT 50 mg/kg HPD, there was a decrease in VP. At each HPD dose above 10 mg/kg, the VP increased as a function of light dose up to 75 J/cm2. Further increase in light dose was without effect. The amount of HPD porphyrin recovered from irradiated ears decreased as a function of light dose. There appeared to be an irreversible photo destruction of the porphyrin exposed to light.\r"

  ".W": "The human squamous carcinoma cell line P3 was subjected to treatment with a single mode argon laser at 514.5 nm. The temperature and energy levels delivered to the target cells were determined by a reproducible method of dosimetry. At energy levels between 860 to 990 J/cm2 and a corresponding temperature of 39 +/- 1 degrees C, a significant delayed stimulation in DNA synthesis was noted after 24 hours, but the cells remained viable. However, at energy levels and temperatures higher or equal to 1100 J/cm2 (41 degrees C), an immediate suppression of DNA synthesis was accompanied by nonviability of the P3 carcinoma cells. These results indicate that the argon laser has potential for selective biostimulation on carcinoma cell duplication at the specific \"non-thermal\" range of 39 +/- 1 degrees C. Similar effects were not observed when the P3 carcinoma cells were heated to this same temperature using a standard heat bath. This phenomenon appears to represent a previously undescribed potential iatrogenic effect of the monochromatic laser beam in the treatment of cancer.\r"

To best overcome the problem of recurrent disease, we have adopted a combined otorhinolaryngologic-neurosurgical approach which emphasizes removal of as much as possible of the mucocele and marsupialization, or permanent drainage, of the disease site into the nasal cavity. Recently, we have modified this procedure in selected cases to include resection of involved dura and isolation of the epidural space from the nasal cavity. The indications and results of both forms of management are now reported in ten patients.\r"

Particular emphasis is placed on the problematic cases. These include fractures that were nearly overlooked, those that were associated with massive CSF leaks, and those which were extensively comminuted. In treating some of the most severe compound injuries, a frontalis myofascial flap has been used successfully to \"plug\" the site of CSF leakage. The review will include the types of fractures encountered, associated injuries, errors in diagnosis, the treatment rendered, and the complications which resulted. As encountered in other studies relating to trauma, adequate follow-up has been a serious shortcoming. The protocol presently used in the management of these injuries will be outlined.\r"

Samples of saliva were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria immediately before, and at 1- and 4-hour intervals after, rinsing the mouth with a solution of either placebo or clindamycin. Quantitative analysis demonstrated significantly reduced levels of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria after use of the topical antibiotic at both the 1- and 4-hour intervals.

Postoperative complications in 24 patients receiving prior BID irradiation were compared with 37 controls receiving QD treatments. The incidence of major surgical complications for BID and QD groups was equivalent (20.8% and 18.9%, respectively). The incidence of minor complications was almost three times greater for the BID group (37.5% vs. 13.5%). Patients receiving BID radiation therapy required twice as many intraoperative transfusions (2.13 vs. 1.11) and five additional days of postoperative hospitalization (23.7 vs. 18.2). These differences are statistically significant with p-values of less than 0.5 and less than 0.1, respectively. We consider this increase in surgical morbidity to be acceptable if BID radiation therapy leads to improved tumor control.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed our experience with 408 consecutive patients evaluated for thyroid surgery. Two hundred seventy-three ultimately underwent thyroidectomy; 100 of these had preoperative FNA. An additional 135 patients underwent FNA without surgery. Patients who benefited from FNA were those in whom cytologic findings led to surgery for otherwise unsuspected malignancy (15), and those with asymptomatic benign nodules who avoided unnecessary thyroidectomy on the basis of FNA findings (96). FNA is superfluous when clinical conditions mandate surgery. These include nodules that arouse clinical suspicion of malignancy, massive nodules that cause aerodigestive tract compression or cosmetic disfigurement, and nodules extending into the mediastinum. All patients with asymptomatic, clinically benign thyroid nodules should undergo FNA biopsy, as approximately 50% can anticipate significant benefit from the procedure.\r"

The two groups receiving adenoidectomy did significantly better than those who did not, and the effect was independent of adenoid size.

There were 13 babies with normal ratings in each ear at 80% more of their visits (designated as \"otitis free\") and 12 babies with bilaterally positive otoscopy results at 30% or more of their first year visits (designated \"otitis positive\"). In comparison to the otitis free infants, the group of otitis positive babies demonstrated reduced auditory sensitivity as measured by auditory brain stem response (ABR) and poorer expressive language abilities. However, differences in receptive language were not detected. These results suggest that otitis media may have an impact on auditory sensitivity and developing language as early as 1 year of age.\r"

The usage of the term peristalsis to describe the constrictor contraction is challenged. The results of this quantitative study of swallowing in normal subjects, laryngectomized patients, and patients with restricted tongue motion show that tongue driving pressure and the negative pressure developed in the pharyngeal esophageal segment appear more important than the peristaltic-like pressure of the constrictors. Bolus transit is really dependent upon these two pressures. This model for analysis has clinical significance because it permits quantification of the pharyngeal swallowing mechanism.\r"

Little is known about either the natural history or the systemic manifestations of this disease. We reviewed the medical records of 19 patients with biopsy-proven scleromyxedema seen from 1950 to 1985 for evidence of systemic disease. There were 10 males and 9 females with a median age at diagnosis of 53 years. Monoclonal gammopathy was present in 13 patients. Eight patients complained of dysphagia; 3 had proximal esophageal dysfunction and 1 had total esophageal aperistalsis on barium swallow. Proximal muscle weakness was noted in 5, with an inflammatory myopathy in 3. Six patients complained of dyspnea on exertion. Of these, 5 had reduced diffusing capacity, 3 had reduced volumes, and 2 developed cor pulmonale. Pathologic changes characteristic of \"scleroderma kidney\" were demonstrated in 1 patient at postmortem. One patient had Raynaud's phenomenon and 2 had arthralgias/arthritis with noninflammatory synovial fluids. Although 8 of 12 patients treated with melphalan noted regression of their skin changes, no consistent improvement in the extracutaneous manifestations was demonstrated. Furthermore, 2 patients died of sepsis related to melphalan-induced myelosuppression, and 4 developed hematological malignancies following melphalan therapy. In conclusion, systemic manifestations in scleromyxedema are more prevalent than previously recognized, and can resemble those of scleroderma. Significant toxicity occurred with the use of alkylating agents in these patients, with treatment-related complications developing in 45% of patients treated with melphalan. The lack of definitive data regarding the natural history of this disease complicates the question of optimal therapy, but the use of alkylating agents should be reserved for those patients with severe debilitating skin disease.\r"

Both perfusion and diffusion defects have been demonstrated, with generalized pulmonary fibrosis and disabling restrictive lung failure. We report 28 cases (25 SS, 1 S beta degrees thalassemia, 1 S beta + thalassemia and 1 SO-Arab) which began during the second decade of life and which ended in death by the fourth decade, after an ordered progression to pulmonary failure and cor pulmonale. Myocardial hypoxia with multifocal fibrosis and segmental infarction occurred in more than one-third of the cases and sudden death was a frequent final event. We define 4 stages of SCLD, based on pulmonary function tests, chest roentgenograms, blood gases, and noninvasive cardiac studies; each stage is 2 or 3 years in length, until death ensues in Stage 4. Case-control analysis showed that the significant risk factors associated with SCLD are 1) the total number of acute chest syndrome events in an individual before the onset of SCLD, (p = 0.0001), 2) sickle cell crisis marked by chest pain (p = 0.03) and 3) aseptic necrosis (p = 0.005). Temporal clustering of acute chest syndrome episodes frequently heralds the onset of SCLD. The pulmonary arterial bed, which has low oxygen tension and low pressure in a slow-flow system, is ideally suited to facilitate the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, causing endothelial damage and culminating in an obstructive arteriolar vasculopathy. Identification of the significant risk factors predictive of SCLD can lead to early diagnosis of the disease; this is the only hope for effective intervention therapy.\r"

  ".W": "No therapy has been proved to be effective for patients with severe chloroquine poisoning, which is usually fatal. In a retrospective study of 51 cases, we found that ingestion of more than 5 g of chloroquine was an accurate predictor of a fatal outcome, and therefore chose this dose as the criterion for severe chloroquine poisoning. We selected as a control group 11 consecutive patients who had ingested more than 5 g of chloroquine between July 1983 and December 1985. We then undertook a prospective study to determine whether a better outcome could be obtained with immediate mechanical ventilation and the administration of diazepam and epinephrine. Eleven consecutive patients who ingested more than 5 g of chloroquine in 1986 received this combination therapy. Ten of these patients survived, whereas only one control had survived (P = 0.0003). There was no significant difference between the combination-therapy and control groups in age (29 +/- 3 vs. 27 +/- 2 years), amount of chloroquine ingested (7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.8 g), systolic arterial pressure (74 +/- 2 vs. 74 +/- 3 mm Hg), or QRS duration (0.14 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.01 second). In our combination-therapy group, blood chloroquine levels ranged from 40 to 80 mumol per liter, whereas a literature search showed that no patient in whom blood levels were more than 25 mumol per liter had survived. These preliminary data suggest that combining early mechanical ventilation with the administration of diazepam and epinephrine may be effective in the treatment of severe chloroquine poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effectiveness of chewing gum containing nicotine, in combination with group counseling, for subjects who were attempting to stop smoking. We used the Horn-Russell scale, based on a smoking questionnaire, to measure dependence on cigarettes; 173 smokers were grouped as highly dependent on nicotine or as having medium to low degrees of dependence. In a randomized double-blind study, the 60 highly dependent smokers were given gum containing 4 mg of nicotine (n = 27) or 2 mg of nicotine (n = 33), and the 113 smokers with medium or low dependence were given gum containing 2 mg of nicotine (n = 60) or a placebo gum (n = 53). All smokers took part in group counseling. In the highly dependent group, abstinence from cigarettes was chemically verified after six weeks, one year, and two years; 81.5 percent, 44.4 percent, and 33.3 percent of the subjects given gum containing 4 mg of nicotine were abstinent after those follow-up periods; the rates of abstinence were 54.5 percent, 12.1 percent, and 6.1 percent, respectively, for the subjects given gum containing 2 mg of nicotine. In the group with medium or low dependence, the rates of abstinence after the same periods were 73.3 percent, 38.3 percent, and 28.3 percent for the subjects given gum containing 2 mg of nicotine and 41.5 percent, 22.6 percent, and 9.4 percent for those given placebo gum. The differences in outcomes were significant at the 5 percent level for all comparisons, with the exception of the 2-mg nicotine gum versus the placebo gum at one year. This study indicates that the effectiveness of nicotine gum is not due to a placebo effect and that it is related to dose. The use of nicotine gum in appropriate doses should be helpful to persons who are attempting to stop smoking.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of electrophysiologic testing in the prediction of long-term outcome in 166 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction. Ventricular arrhythmias were inducible in 131 patients (79 percent) at base line and were suppressed by antiarrhythmic drugs or surgery (or both) in 91 of 127 (72 percent). During a median follow-up period of 21 months, cardiac arrest recurred in 29 patients: 11 (12 percent) of the 91 in whom inducible arrhythmias had been suppressed (including 5 patients in whom treatment had been discontinued), 12 (33 percent) of the 36 in whom inducible arrhythmias persisted, and 6 (17 percent) of the 35 in whom arrhythmias could not be induced at the initial electrophysiologic study. Cox survival analysis identified the following three variables as significant independent predictors of recurrent cardiac arrest: persistence of inducible ventricular arrhythmias (relative risk, 3.97 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.80 to 8.75], P = 0.0006), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less (relative risk, 2.60 [1.21 to 5.53], P = 0.0138), and the absence of cardiac surgery (relative risk, 4.20 [0.99 to 17.77], P = 0.0512). We conclude that electrophysiologic testing is useful in quantifying the subsequent risk of cardiac arrest among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\r"

We studied the survival of 257 male patients with CHD from the initial, 8.5-year phase of the Western Collaborative Group Study to see whether behavior type--as assessed by a structured interview before the CHD event--was related to subsequent CHD mortality. Behavior type was not related to mortality in 26 patients who died within 24 hours of the coronary event. However, of the 231 patients who survived for 24 hours, the mortality rate associated with CHD among 160 Type A patients studied during an average 12.7 years was 19.1 per 1000 person-years. This was unexpectedly lower than the corresponding rate of 31.7 among 71 Type B patients who were followed for an average of 11.5 years (P = 0.04). In a proportional-hazards survival analysis, which controlled for variable follow-up time, the type of initial coronary event, and traditional risk variables, the relative CHD-associated mortality rate among Type A as compared with Type B patients was 0.58 (P = 0.03; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.96). The lower mortality among Type A subjects occurred in both younger and older subgroups but was more pronounced in patients whose initial diagnosis was symptomatic myocardial infarction rather than silent myocardial infarction or angina pectoris. This apparent advantage associated with Type A behavior is surprising and needs confirmation, but the results do indicate that patients with CHD and a Type A behavior pattern are not at increased risk for subsequent CHD mortality.\r"

Eight-three second cancers occurred more than one year after diagnosis, as compared with 15.9 expected on the basis of rates in the general population (relative risk, 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.2 to 6.5). The mean (+/- SE) 15-year actuarial risk of all second cancers was 17.6 +/- 3.1 percent, of which 13.2 +/- 3.1 percent was due to solid tumors. The risk of leukemia appeared to reach a plateau level of 3.3 +/- 0.6 percent at 10 years, whereas non-Hodgkin's lymphoma continued to increase, to 1.6 +/- 0.7 percent by the end of the follow-up period. The risk of solid tumors did not vary significantly according to treatment category, with the array of neoplasms resembling that previously observed in populations exposed to radiation and in immunosuppressed groups. The risk of leukemia, although elevated after radiation therapy alone (relative risk, 11; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 38), was much higher after either adjuvant chemotherapy (relative risk, 117; 95 percent confidence interval, 69 to 185) or chemotherapy alone (relative risk, 130; 95 percent confidence interval, 26 to 380). These data suggest that the risk of solid tumors after therapy for Hodgkin's disease continues to increase with time.\r"

Of 158 such babies (birth weight, less than 1500 g) admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit in 1985, 49 (31 percent) underwent CPR. Low birth weight, low Apgar scores, birth asphyxia, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, hyaline membrane disease, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage were associated with the need for CPR. None of the 38 babies who received CPR in the first three days of life survived. Four of the 11 babies who received CPR after the first 72 hours survived. Three of the four survivors had residual neurologic deficits. Survival rates after CPR in infants of very low birth weight are lower than those in older children or adults. CPR may therefore be considered a nonvalidated therapy in this population. If the results of our study are confirmed, CPR should not be instituted automatically in very-low-birth-weight babies as though it were a validated treatment. Instead, it should be administered upon parents' advance informed consent to experimental treatment.\r"

Unexpectedly, we found that 12 subjects--7 males and 5 females ranging in age from 13 to 30 years--had morphologic features of right ventricular cardiomyopathy. This disorder had not been diagnosed or suspected before the subjects died. In five cases, sudden death was the first sign of disease; the remaining seven subjects had a history of palpitation, syncopal episodes, or both, and in five of those seven, ventricular arrhythmias had previously been recorded on electrocardiographic examination. Ten of the subjects had died during exertion. At autopsy, the subjects' heart weights were normal or moderately increased. Two main histologic patterns were identified--a lipomatous transformation or a fibrolipomatous transformation of the right ventricular free wall (6 cases each); in all cases, the left ventricle was substantially spared. Signs of myocardial degeneration and necrosis, with or without inflammatory infiltrates, were occasionally observed. These findings indicate that right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the cause of which is still unknown, may be more frequent than previously thought. At least in this area of Italy, it may represent an important cause of sudden death among young people.\r"

To investigate the possible effect on such enzymes of long-term consumption of large quantities of ethanol, we assayed the activities of two enzymes, monoamine oxidase and adenylate cyclase, in platelet membranes of men with alcoholism and controls matched for sex and age. We also compared these two groups in terms of the inhibition of platelet monoamine oxidase activity by ethanol in vitro (400 mM), and in terms of the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by various agents. There was no significant difference in monoamine oxidase activity between the alcoholics and the controls. However, the inhibition of monoamine oxidase by ethanol was significantly higher in the platelets of alcoholics. The basal activity of adenylate cyclase was the same in platelets from the alcoholics and the controls, but the platelet adenylate cyclase activity after stimulation with guanine nucleotide, cesium fluoride, or prostaglandin E1 was significantly lower in alcoholics. These differences were not associated with age, race, smoking, or illicit drug use, and there was no significant correlation with the duration of problems with alcohol. The changes were long-lasting; cesium fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was lower in alcoholic subjects who had abstained from alcohol for one to four years. Discriminant analysis showed that the use of values for the inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity by ethanol and cesium fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity correctly classified 75 percent of the alcoholics and 73 percent of the controls. These measures may be of value either as indexes of excessive alcohol consumption or as an indication of a predisposition to alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Only one third of patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes seem to be susceptible to diabetic nephropathy. To test whether this susceptibility is related to a predisposition to hypertension, we investigated the association of nephropathy with markers of risk for hypertension. We randomly selected 89 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes from a roster of children and adolescents who were seen between 1968 and 1972 at about the time the diagnosis was made. These 89 patients were recalled for examination, as young adults, in 1986 and 1987. Patients with nephropathy (cases, n = 33) were compared with controls without nephropathy (n = 56). Having a parent with hypertension tripled the risk of nephropathy (odds ratio, 3.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 10.1). Moreover, cases had significantly higher values for maximal velocity of lithium-sodium countertransport in red cells than controls (mean maximal velocity +/- SE, 0.51 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter of cells per hour; P less than 0.05). The excess risk associated with both these indicators of a predisposition to hypertension was evident principally in patients with poor glycemic control during their first decade of diabetes; the odds ratios were 4.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 18.7) for patients with a parental history of hypertension and 7.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 33.8) for patients with a maximal velocity of lithium-sodium countertransport greater than or equal to 0.35 mmol per liter of cells per hour. We conclude that the risk of renal disease in patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Predisposition to hypertension appears to increase susceptibility for renal disease principally in patients with poor glycemic control.\r"

We have studied the activity of sodium-lithium countertransport in red cells, a marker of risk for essential hypertension, in white European adults with insulin-dependent diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, a matched group of patients with diabetes without renal disease, and nondiabetic patients with renal disease. Measures of metabolic control and concentrations of plasma free insulin and growth hormone were similar in the two diabetic groups. The degree of impairment in renal function was similar in the diabetic and nondiabetic patients with renal disease. Body-mass index and plasma potassium concentrations were similar in all three groups. Diastolic blood pressure was elevated to a similar degree in the two groups with renal disease, as compared with that in the diabetic patients without renal disease. The rates of sodium-lithium countertransport in red cells were significantly higher in the diabetic patients with renal disease (mean +/- SD, 0.55 +/- 0.19 mmol of lithium per liter of red cells per hour) than in the diabetic patients without renal disease (0.33 +/- 0.16; P less than 0.005) and in the nondiabetic patients with renal disease (0.31 +/- 0.14; P less than 0.001). Predisposition to hypertension, as indicated by elevated sodium-lithium countertransport activity in red cells, may serve as a marker for the risk of renal disease in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Because of allegations that the implantation of many permanent cardiac pacemakers has been unjustified, we reviewed the indications for all new pacemakers implanted at 30 hospitals in Philadelphia County between January 1 and June 30, 1983, and paid for by Medicare. Complete chart data were evaluated for 382 implants. We determined whether the indications for implantation were appropriate and adequately documented on the basis of standard clinical practice. Implants were classified as possibly indicated primarily because of inadequate diagnostic evaluation (63 percent) or inadequate documentation of an accepted indication (36 percent). Implants were classified as not indicated primarily because a rhythm abnormality was incorrectly identified as a justifiable indication (84 percent). We found that 168 implants (44 percent) were definitely indicated, 137 (36 percent) possibly indicated, and 77 (20 percent) not indicated. Unwarranted implantation was both prevalent (73 percent of hospitals had an incidence of 10 percent or more) and independent of the type of hospital (university teaching, university-affiliated, and community hospitals). The additional tests most often required to clarify the need for a pacemaker in inadequately evaluated cases included electrophysiologic studies (37 percent) and ambulatory monitoring (31 percent). We conclude that in a large medical population in 1983, the indications for a considerable number of permanent pacemakers were inadequate or incompletely documented.\r"

  ".U": "88094591\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients attending inner-city clinics for sexually transmitted diseases in Baltimore, we screened 4028 patients anonymously, of whom 209 (5.2 percent) were seropositive for HIV. HIV-seropositivity rates were higher among men (6.3 percent) than women (3.0 percent) (P less than 0.001) and among blacks (5.0 percent) than whites (1.2 percent) (P less than 0.02). Among men, but not women, HIV seroprevalence increased markedly and steadily up to the age of 40. In men, HIV seropositivity was independently associated with increased age, black race, a history of homosexual contact, and the use of parenteral drugs. In women, a history of parenteral drug use or of being a sexual partner of a bisexual man or parenteral drug user were independently predictive of HIV seropositivity. In men, HIV seropositivity was also associated with a history of syphilis or a reactive serologic test for syphilis, and in women, with a history of genital warts. Since these associations were independent of the type and number of reported sexual partners, they raise the possibility that sexually transmitted diseases that disrupt epithelial surfaces may be important in the transmissibility of HIV. In addition, on a self-administered questionnaire, one third of HIV-infected men and one half of infected women did not acknowledge previous high-risk behavior for HIV exposure. These data suggest that patients at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases represent a group at high risk for HIV infection, and that screening, counseling, and intensive education should be offered to all patients attending such clinics.\r"

We undertook a clinicopathological study of 73 cases to determine whether any clinical differences between the nodular and diffuse subtypes could be discerned. Patients with the diffuse form (n = 41) tended to have a course similar to that of other types of Hodgkin's disease; there were few relapses and only two deaths due to Hodgkin's disease. In contrast, patients with the nodular form (n = 32) had significantly more relapses, which were independent of stage or treatment and equally distributed up to 10 years after initial therapy. Despite the frequent relapses, patients with the nodular form had an indolent course, and there was only one death due to Hodgkin's disease. There were seven fatal second cancers and two non-neoplastic treatment-related deaths, equally distributed between the nodular and diffuse groups. We conclude that nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin's disease may have important clinical as well as immunophenotypic differences from other forms of Hodgkin's disease, and that patients with this condition should be followed carefully because of the possibility of late relapse.\r"

  ".W": "In August 1985, the Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty Registry of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute reopened at its previous sites to document changes in angioplasty strategy and outcome. The new registry entered 1802 consecutive patients who had not had a myocardial infarction in the 10 days before angioplasty. Patient selection, technical outcome, and short-term major complications were compared with those of the 1977 to 1981 registry cohort. The new-registry patients were older and had a significantly higher proportion of multivessel disease (53 vs. 25 percent, P less than 0.001), poor left ventricular function (19 vs. 8 percent, P less than 0.001), previous myocardial infarction (37 vs. 21 percent, P less than 0.001), and previous coronary bypass surgery (13 vs. 9 percent, P less than 0.01). The new-registry cohort also had more complex coronary lesions, and angioplasty attempts in these patients involved more multivessel procedures. Despite these differences, the in-hospital outcome in the new cohort was better. Angiographic success rates according to lesion increased from 67 to 88 percent (P less than 0.001), and overall success rates (measured as a reduction of at least 20 percent in all lesions attempted, without death, myocardial infarction, or coronary bypass surgery) increased from 61 to 78 percent (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality for the new cohort was 1 percent, and the nonfatal myocardial infarction rate was 4.3 percent. Both rates are similar to those for the old registry. The long-term efficacy of current angioplasty remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "When infection with Toxoplasma gondii occurs during pregnancy, there is a risk that the parasite will cause severe congenital toxoplasmosis. We developed a method of diagnosing and treating congenital toxoplasmosis in utero. Diagnosis was based on the identification of maternal acute infection, followed by culture of fetal blood and amniotic fluid, testing of fetal blood for toxoplasma-specific IgM and nonspecific measures of infection, and ultrasound examination of the fetal brain. Treatment included the administration of antibiotics to all mothers with confirmed acute infection during pregnancy, with more intensive antibiotic treatment of those who had infected fetuses and who chose to continue the pregnancy. We report a prospective study of 746 documented cases of maternal toxoplasma infection, in which the infants were followed for at least three months. Infection was diagnosed antenatally in 39 of 42 fetuses. Twenty-four of the 39 pregnancies were terminated, and 15 were continued. All the mothers were treated with spiramycin throughout pregnancy; if fetal infection was demonstrated, pyrimethamine and either sulfadoxine or sulfadiazine were added to the regimen. Of the 15 fetuses with congenital toxoplasmosis who were carried to term, all but 2, who had chorioretinitis, remained clinically well during follow-up. We conclude that prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is practical and that prenatal therapy in women who wish to continue their pregnancies reduces the severity of the manifestations of the disease.\r"

Five (0.8 percent) were positive, and HIV was isolated from one of these. Follow-up investigations in 1985 revealed that three of the five seropositive persons had died of illnesses suggestive of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and two remained healthy but seropositive. In 1986, a serosurvey we conducted using a cluster-sampling technique in the same region showed a seroprevalence of 0.8 percent in 389 randomly selected residents. The seroprevalence in 283 prostitutes was 11 percent. Patients with AIDS were identified in various hospitals in the province. Risk factors for AIDS included a greater than average number of sexual partners and residence outside the area. We believe that the long-term stability of HIV infection in residents of rural Zaire suggests that social change may have promoted the spread of AIDS in Africa.\r"

For example, if a person were to close one eye and look at an evenly illuminated, irregularly shaped object, he would be unlikely to guess its shape correctly. But if the object is moved about, the correct shape immediately becomes apparent. Little is known about how the primate visual system actually does this, although various theories have been proposed. We have developed novel, highly controlled motion stimuli to use with psychophysical and physiological techniques to study how 3-D structure is obtained from motion. We show that the Rhesus monkey can detect 3-D structure from motion in the same way as human subjects. Furthermore, the dependence of both species on certain parameters of the display shows that information is integrated both spatially and temporally for this higher visual function.\r"

  ".W": "Developing vertebrate neurons are thought to depend for their survival on specific neurotrophic proteins present in their target fields. The limited availability of these proteins does not allow the survival of all neurons initially innervating a target, resulting in the widely observed phenomenon of naturally occurring neuronal death. Although a variety of proteins have been reported to promote the survival of neurons in tissue culture, the demonstration that these proteins increase neuronal numbers and/or decrease neuronal death in vivo has only been possible with nerve growth factor (NGF). The generalization of the concept that neurotrophic proteins regulate neuronal survival during normal development critically depends on the demonstration that the survival of neurons in vivo can be increased by the administration of a neurotrophic protein different from NGF. We report here that this is the case with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein of extremely low abundance purified from the central nervous system.\r"

  ".U": "88094732\r", 
  ".W": "The response of the foot to touch during walking depends on whether it is in the air or on the ground. In most animals, reflex responses to external stimuli are similarly adapted to their timing in the locomotor cycle, but there is only fragmentary information about the neural mechanisms involved. In arthropods, reflex modulation can occur in the sensory receptors themselves and in neurons that discharge during locomotion. By recording with dye-filled microelectrodes from neurons in the spinal cord of frog embryos, we describe reflex modulation at the level of sensory interneurons. Sensory inputs from skin receptors excite a specific class of spinal sensory interneuron whose activity leads to reflex bending of the body away from the stimulus. During swimming, these inputs are gated by rhythmic postsynaptic inhibition, so that sensory drive reaches motor neurons only at phases in the locomotor cycle when the resulting contraction would likewise turn the embryo away from the stimulated side. Such gating of sensory pathways could be a general feature of all locomotor systems where responses to sensory stimuli need to be adapted to the phase of locomotion.\r"

  ".U": "88094739\r", 
  ".W": "The diverse functions of RNA, which include enzymatic activities, regulatory roles in transcription and translation, are made possible by tertiary structure. Computer algorithms can predict the secondary structure of an RNA molecule using free-energy parameters for base pairing and stacking, loops and bulges. However, with the exception of transfer RNA, little is known about the structures and thermodynamics of interactions involved in the tertiary structure of RNA. Recently, it has been proposed that a novel form of RNA folding called pseudoknotting occurs at the 3' end of certain viral RNAs from plants. A pseudoknot involves intramolecular pairing of bases in a hairpin loop with a few bases outside the stem of the loop to form an additional stem and loop region (Fig. 1). If each stem contained a full helical turn, a true knot would be formed. We present evidence from single-strand specific (S1) and double-strand specific (V1) nuclease digestion, that a short RNA oligonucleotide (19 nucleotides long) adopts a stable pseudoknotted structure. The nuclease digestion and thermodynamic properties of this oligonucleotide were compared with those of oligonucleotides which form hairpin structures containing the two possible stem regions in the pseudoknot. These results show that appropriate sequences can form pseudoknots and indicate that pseudoknots are a significant type of local tertiary structure which must be considered in the folding of complex RNA molecules.\r"

Target stimuli in the intact hemifield elicited a well-formed P3 response in all subjects, whereas stimuli in the blind field produced no such response except in the subject with blindsight. In addition, the earlier potentials in this subject were larger with stimulation of the blind hemifield than the intact field. By contrast, a P100 response was present only with stimulation of the intact field in this subject. These results indicate that cognitive processing of visual stimuli can occur even when subjective awareness of such stimuli is absent, and suggest that such processing occurs independently of the geniculostriate pathway.\r"

Bidirectional palsy of vertical saccades is attributed to unilateral loss of burst cells in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) and interruption of burst cell fibers from the opposite riMLF. Pathways mediating vertical pursuit and integration of the vertical VOR also traversed the infarct, which included the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.\r"

We measured horizontal and vertical eye movements with the magnetic search coil technique and used these electronic signals to control the position of a visual stimulus on a screen in front of the patient. We also used an optical device to stabilize images of the real world upon the retina. During electronic stabilization, RIS was progressively increased until oscillopsia was abolished; this was achieved in all eight patients and corresponded to retinal image drift of 5 degrees/sec or less. In five patients with downbeat nystagmus, further increases in RIS caused the oscillopsia to reappear, but in the opposite direction. Electronic stabilization also improved visual acuity in four of five patients; the limitation of improvement could be related to coexistent visual system defects. Using electronic feedback, we could measure the range of RIS that any individual required to abolish oscillopsia; from this measurement, the components of the optical device that were best suited to provide a stable field of vision could be calculated.\r"

Incidence (cases per 100,000 person-years) was 99 (crude) overall, whereas the age-adjusted rates were 52 for the men, 149 for the women, and 105 for both sexes combined. Age-adjusted incidence rates increased from 88 during the 1961 to 1965 quinquennium to 125 during the 1976 to 1980 quinquennium; these rates probably reflect better recognition rather than a true increase in incidence rates. Age-specific rates generally increased with age in men, whereas in women a peak was reached in the 45 to 54 age group.\r"

Fourteen had NMG, including 4 atypical cases. Anti-AChR antibody titer was the best indication of NMG onset. NMG in a previous baby was also predictive.

On comparison of specific epileptiform abnormalities identified blindly, a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 8% were encountered. Posterior temporal complexes accounted for most false negatives, and most false positives did not represent failings of the recording technique. We conclude that EEG recording outside the hairline with disposable electrodes represents a reliable means to acquire, quickly and simply, EEG evidence of epilepsy. As such, it may prove useful in the acute evaluation of patients presenting with apparent seizures.\r"

Indeed, an autonomously proliferating T-cell clone was isolated from the CSF of an MS patient, an observation interpreted as indicating an infection with human T lymphotropic virus I (HTLV I). In view of these findings, we undertook a systematic search for autonomously proliferating cells in the spinal fluids of MS patients and those with other neurologic diseases (OND). In vivo activated blast cells were isolated from the CSF of six MS patients and six OND controls. A total of 442 clones were grown from these cells and assayed for their ability to proliferate independently, without the need for T cell-produced lymphokines. No autonomously proliferating clones were detected. Thus, while our data do not exclude the possibility that HTLV I transformed cells may exist in the CSF of MS patients, they do suggest that such cells are exceptional.\r"

Despite careful search, no pathologic evidence of encephalitis was found. One patient, with the typical course, had no seizures but striking positive correlation between epileptic discharge and language disorder; the second, after classic onset, developed intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, a previously unreported outcome of this syndrome. EEG discharges are generalized, bilateral, multifocal, or with shifting predominance but mainly temporal in 85% of reported cases, and unilateral, also predominantly temporal, in 15%. Language areas are preferentially involved. This syndrome has certain biologic features that resemble the benign epilepsies of childhood and may be the result of the unusual localization of the epileptic abnormality.\r"

Differences in these parameters between young Alzheimer cases and young controls were similar to the differences found between old Alzheimer cases and old controls. Linear regression analyses correlating some of these variables with age in Alzheimer's disease, considered together with the effects of normal aging on the same parameters, reveal in Alzheimer's disease a spectrum of graded pathologic severity inversely proportional to age. Nevertheless, even in advanced old age (80 to 100), significant differences persist in these parameters between very elderly Alzheimer brains and controls.\r"

On autopsy, the brain was normally developed, but there was severe demyelination and gliosis throughout the white matter; the cerebellar cortex showed atrophy. The striking, unexpected finding was the presence of numerous Alzheimer's tangles containing paired helical filaments in electronmicroscopic examination, not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the brainstem, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus including the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Other unusual findings were hyperostosis of the skull and the appearance of macrophages containing PAS-positive granules in the reticuloendothelial system in many organs.\r"

Serum was analyzed for haloperidol by two different methods, gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) and radioreceptor (RR) assays. Steady-state serum haloperidol concentrations (GC/MS) of 0.5 to 24 ng/ml were observed following administration of doses of 1 to 40 mg/d and varied markedly between patients. Only results from the GC/MS assay were used for examining relationships with dose and clinical response because of insensitivity of RR assay. Significant improvement of abnormal movements, greater than 30% from baseline, occurred at serum concentrations between 2 and 5 ng/ml, which corresponded to doses of 1.5 to 10 mg/d. Further improvement in abnormal movements at serum concentrations above this range was minimal.\r"

PPMA muscles that had been left weak since the original illness showed a mixture of myopathy with new and old denervation including group atrophy and nuclear clumps. Fully recovered or originally spared PPMA muscles showed signs of reinnervation and recent denervation. Perivascular or interstitial inflammatory cells (predominantly lymphocytes unrelated to phagocytosis) were noted in 40% of all the PPMA biopsies. It is concluded that (1) postpolio muscle biopsies show a spectrum of morphologic changes that depend on whether the biopsied muscle was originally affected and had fully or partially recovered, (2) the newly weakened muscles show signs of recent denervation, and (3) the presence of reinnervation in the asymptomatic muscles and the patterns of recent and old denervation in PPMA muscles provide information regarding the degree of compensation of the surviving motor neurons and their apparent failure for further reinnervation via axonal sprouting.\r"

Patients were included in the study only if they met characteristic light and electron microscopic criteria for neuroendocrine small-cell cancer. Thirteen patients underwent radical hysterectomy and one a simple hysterectomy. All patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy, with 57% found to have nodal metastases. Twelve of 14 patients are dead of disease eight to 31 months after treatment, and the two living patients had recurrence at 38 and 44 months. One is without evidence of disease 18 months after radiation for a pelvic recurrence, and the other has survived five months after recurrence without treatment. The interval from treatment to recurrence was substantially longer in patients with tumors up to 2 cm in diameter as compared with those greater than 2 cm. Despite the early stage of cancer in these patients, the dismal outcome indicates that traditional modes of therapy for cervical cancer are not effective in cases of neuroendocrine small-cell carcinoma.\r"

Patient responses were compared with a matched sample of gynecologically healthy women. The results indicated a specific pattern of sexual disruption for the women treated for preinvasive disease. Sexual behavior patterns appeared to be maintained, as was the desire phase of the sexual response cycle. However, there was specific disruption of the phases of excitement and resolution and, to a lesser extent, orgasm. In addition to a two- to threefold increase in the frequency of sexual dysfunction, 30% of the sample was sexually inactive at follow-up. Although replication of these findings is necessary, this investigation suggests that sexual functioning correlates with the magnitude of treatment.\r"

Cyclic menstrual bleeding occurred in all ten patients on sequential therapy; their endometrial histology was secretory in six, proliferative in two, and adenomatous hyperplasia in one. Of the ten patients on continuous therapy, four were amenorrheic and six experienced acyclic bleeding, but the endometrial histology was atrophic or inactive in all ten. The continuous treatment group experienced a statistically significant decrease in the mean serum levels of total cholesterol, whereas the serum levels of both low- and high-density cholesterol fractions decreased slightly. However, the sequential group experienced no change in serum levels of total cholesterol, a slight rise in high-density lipoprotein, and a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions. Our data suggest that the combined and continuous use of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate effectively relieves menopausal symptoms, decreases the frequency of uterine bleeding, induces endometrial atrophy, and significantly decreases serum levels of total cholesterol.\r"

Twenty-seven cycles in 18 volunteers were analyzed. A slight correlation could be demonstrated between the day of salivary electrical resistance peak and the day of luteinizing hormone (LH) peak. However, the changes in salivary electrical resistance values, arranged to the day of LH peak, were not statistically significant. The days of salivary electrical resistance peak in relation to the day of LH peak were not reproducible in individual women. The apparent relationship between the day of salivary electrical resistance peak and the day LH peak might be explained by the methodology used. It is concluded that measuring the salivary electrical resistance is of no use in predicting the day of ovulation.\r"

After seven and 14 days of treatment, no significant difference in basal serum PRL levels was observed. However, women subjected to metergoline treatment had significantly higher responses of PRL to metoclopramide as compared with those treated with either bromocriptine or lisuride. Thus, the PRL-lowering mechanism of metergoline appears to be different from those of bromocriptine and lisuride.\r"

Subepithelial plasma cells were identified in each specimen of fallopian tube, endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. Approximately two-thirds of the immunoglobulin-positive cells contained IgA and J chain, indicating that they produced polymeric IgA. In comparison to tissues such as spleen and bone marrow, where IgA1-positive cells are produced, we found a high proportion of IgA2-positive cells in fallopian tube, cervix, and vagina. Epithelial cells in fallopian tube and endocervix contained secretory component. These data indicate that secretory IgA, which provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens, is produced locally in tissues of the female reproductive tract.\r"

Clinical studies have reported that older pregnant smokers are at higher risk for impaired fetal growth than younger pregnant smokers. This study examines the relationships among placental cadmium, placental zinc, placental Zn/Cd ratio, age, and parity in 98 smokers and 151 nonsmokers. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to analyze cadmium and zinc. Thiocyanate was used as an index of smoking status. The data were analyzed using univariate correlation and repeated-measures analysis of variance. The results showed that increased parity is related to increased levels of placental cadmium in smokers, and decreased placental zinc in smokers and nonsmokers. Age is inversely related to the Zn/Cd ratio in both smokers and nonsmokers; moreover, the oldest nonsmokers have a higher ratio than the youngest smokers. These results are consistent with a depletion of body zinc stores with increasing parity and the long half-life of cadmium in the body. The data explain in part the clinical finding that smoking during pregnancy is more harmful in older women.\r"

Seventy-nine women who were unable to continue their work because of severe low back pain were referred to an orthopedic surgeon for an orthoneurologic examination. The most common reason for severe low back pain was dysfunction of the sacroiliac joints. Physically strenuous work and previous low back pain were factors associated with an increased risk of developing low back pain and sacroiliac dysfunction during pregnancy.\r"

No differences were demonstrated in age, dilation when oxytocin administration started, length of oxytocin administration, cesarean section rate, complications of delivery, birth weight, or Apgar scores. The maximal oxytocin dose in the 30-minute interval group was significantly lower. This group also had the oxytocin infusion stopped for evidence of uterine hyperstimulation and/or abnormal fetal heart rate tracing significantly less often (6.9% for the 30-minute interval versus 17.8% for the 15-minute interval; P = .0017). Overall, these results suggest that the longer interval does not increase the length of labor but decreases the incidence of uterine hyperstimulation.\r"

In this multiracial population, active management was associated with a decrease in the cesarean section rate, without any evidence of an increase in perinatal mortality or morbidity. The results indicate that active management can be safely applied outside of Ireland to reduce the incidence of cesarean childbirth. It is suggested that this approach to the management of dystocia in labor be evaluated in the United States in a randomized controlled trial.\r"

Calculation of the distribution of this force per unit area would appear to favor the Soft Cup. At high vacuums, all showed large amounts of tractive force and high forces per unit area. The data clearly demonstrate that high vacuum would have potentially adverse effects on the fetus and thus should be avoided.\r"

The results of this investigation suggest that the hemodynamic background to the blood pressure increase in pregnancy-induced hypertension ranges from a low cardiac output, high vascular resistance condition to a high-output, low-normal resistance variant.

Between 1975-1979, 192 women who were treated for a tubal pregnancy in five Seattle hospitals were interviewed with regard to smoking habits and reproductive, contraceptive, and medical histories. For comparison, 459 Seattle-area women who delivered during the same period were also interviewed. Current cigarette smokers had a more than twofold increase in risk of tubal pregnancy (adjusted relative risk 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.4) when compared with women who had never smoked. The risk for women who had stopped smoking before conception was 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0-2.8). There was no consistent trend between the risk of tubal pregnancy and the duration of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, age at which a woman began to smoke, pack-years of cigarettes smoked, or (among former smokers) the recency of smoking. Although several sources of bias in the present study may have created a spurious association between cigarette smoking and the occurrence of tubal pregnancy, it could well be that an increased risk of tubal pregnancy is yet another untoward consequence of cigarette smoking.\r"

The outcomes of 88 women with abnormal testing (NST or Doppler) were compared with the outcomes of 52 women who had normal results on both tests. The results demonstrated that 50% of the fetuses with decreased flow velocity who later developed an abnormal NST were growth-retarded, 75% required a cesarean section, and 63% were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Development of an abnormal NST in the presence of normal velocimetry studies occurred most frequently in the postdates pregnancy; 32% required cesarean section for fetal distress. Knowledge of the umbilical circulation through Doppler studies may be of benefit when selecting patients for NST and when interpreting results.\r"

The umbilical vein diameter, blood velocity, and blood flow in fetuses with hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis were usually higher than those in fetuses with hydrops fetalis from other causes. Umbilical vein blood flow measurement appears to be an effective technique for differentiating hemoglobin Bart's from non-Bart's hydrops in this series. This hemodynamic characteristic of umbilical vein blood flow may be helpful in determining the etiology of nonimmune hydrops fetalis.\r"

Study subjects included ten normal controls, 12 insulin-dependent diabetics, eight gestational diabetics, and five essential hypertensives. Our results indicate that erythrocyte filterability remains relatively stable over the course of normal gestation. We noted no differences between controls and essential hypertensives or gestational diabetics, although a favorable effect of insulin therapy was suggested in gestational diabetics. Erythrocyte filterability and mean arterial blood pressure were not related. Insulin-dependent diabetics demonstrated a significantly elevated and widely varying erythrocyte filterability, and individual patient trends correlated well with outcome. Fibrinogen levels in diabetics rose precipitously and were significantly higher than normal throughout gestation. Fibrinogen levels paralleled changes in erythrocyte filterability, with the two parameters positively correlated. Mean glucose control had no influence on filterability. We conclude that in the diabetic pregnancy, varying erythrocyte filterability is related to altered fibrinogen metabolism and may contribute to perinatal morbidity.\r"

Villus sampling could not be performed in 0.6% of cases, usually because of fibroids. Chorioamnionitis, probably related to the procedure, occurred in two patients (0.2%). The total fetal loss was 2.4%, which is not significantly different from the background fetal loss rate reported in normal pregnancies after eight weeks of gestation. The procedure-related loss was estimated as approximately 0.6%. The cytogenetic analysis routinely used was \"direct\" trophoblast karyotyping. There were no false-negative diagnoses. Trophoblastic mosaicism was observed in 1.3% of samples. Amniocentesis was performed in 3.5% of cases because of chorionic villus sampling failure, chorionic mosaicism, or elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentrations. Chorionic villus sampling was not associated with falsely elevated MSAFP levels at 15-18 weeks' gestation. Chorionic villus sampling has proved a safe and accurate prenatal diagnostic method associated with relatively low risk when performed by an experienced team, although additional amniocentesis will be necessary in a small percentage of pregnancies.\r"

From 1965-1980, 70 female patients with primary presacral tumors underwent surgical management at the Mayo Clinic. Twenty-three percent had no symptoms, and their tumors were found on routine pelvic examination. Most of the symptoms resulted from compression or obstruction of adjacent organs or from pressure on pelvic nerves or bone. A palpable tumor was found in 65 (93%) of the patients. Computed tomography scan has proved valuable in determining the extent and degree of tumor invasion. The abdominal approach was selected in 39 (56%), transsacral in 20 (28%), abdominal/perineal in six (9%), and transperineal in five (7%). Complications occurred in 22 patients (31%). However, there were no operative deaths. Seventy percent of the tumors were benign, and 30% were malignant. The prognosis for patients with benign tumors was excellent and their symptoms were relieved. All 21 patients with malignant tumors died between three months and four years after surgery. Survival was not prolonged by the use of radiation or chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "88095699\r", 
  ".W": "Placentas obtained from women with preeclampsia produce more thromboxane, a potent vasoconstrictor, and less prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator, than normal. Although the factors responsible for this are not known, steroids are known to affect eicosanoid production, and the placenta is a rich source of progesterone and estradiol. If placental steroids contribute to the imbalance of increased thromboxane/decreased prostacyclin in preeclamptic placentas, then their placental production might also be abnormal. The following study was performed to see whether the placentas of preeclamptic women produce progesterone or estradiol abnormally. Fresh human term placentas were obtained immediately after delivery from normal and mild preeclamptic pregnancies. Whole placental tissues (350 mg) were incubated for three hours. Samples were collected and analyzed for progesterone and estradiol-17 beta by radioimmunoassay. Progesterone production was significantly higher in preeclamptic than in normal placentas without the addition of a precursor and with the addition of pregnenolone sulfate as a precursor, but not with the addition of pregnenolone alone. Both normal and preeclamptic placentas converted pregnenolone sulfate into progesterone as efficiently as they converted pregnenolone into progesterone. Estradiol production rates were similar in both preeclamptic and normal placentas, regardless of whether dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was added as a precursor. These data indicate that placentas of women with mild preeclampsia produce more progesterone than normal, probably because they contain more pregnenolone sulfatase and larger stores of endogenous cholesterol. Higher concentrations of progesterone in the preeclamptic placenta could contribute to lower prostacyclin production because progesterone inhibits placental prostacyclin production.\r"

Cervical cytology showed evidence of human papillomavirus infection in only 23 patients (15%). The following colposcopic features were most common: acetowhite epithelium (29%), punctuation (18%), acetowhite spikes (17%), and mosaicism (9%). Colposcopy was essentially normal in 27%. In 64 hysterectomized patients, vaginal colposcopy showed evidence of human papillomavirus infection in 38 women (59%). Vaginal cytology showed signs of human papillomavirus infection in only 9% (N = 6). Acetowhite spikes were seen in 52%, acetowhite epithelium in 5%, punctuation in 3%, and normal findings in 40%. Histologic examination of 25 biopsy specimens (cervical, N = 15; vaginal, N = 10) showed mainly a lack of glycogenation, acanthosis, and elongation of rete pegs. Koilocytosis and dyskeratosis were seen only in a few cases as rare foci, hence the negative cytology. We conclude that colposcopy is far more sensitive than cytology for the detection of cervical and vaginal human papillomavirus infection.\r"

Even patients with isolated complaints of stress incontinence had an incidence of detrusor instability of 34.9%, whereas 76.9% of those with a history of isolated urgency and urge incontinence had detrusor instability. Three percent of patients complaining of either type of incontinence had no objective evidence of incontinence on urodynamic investigation. The results of this study demonstrate that a patient's history is a poor predictor of the underlying cause of incontinence.\r"

The epidemiology of asthma among children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age in the United States was examined using data collected in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this paper, asthma is defined as current disease diagnosed by a physician and/or frequent trouble with wheezing during the past 12 months, not counting colds or the flu. Asthma was reported for 6.7% of youths overall and was higher in black than white children (9.4% v 6.2%, P less than .01), boys than girls (7.8% v 5.5%, P less than .01), and urban than rural areas (7.1% v 5.7%, P less than .05).

Data were pooled and used to estimate five centiles which were smoothed using a flexible mathematical function. These data corroborate other studies of growth in children with Down syndrome demonstrating deficient growth rate throughout the growing period, but most marked in infancy and again at adolescence. Children with Down syndrome in the present sample were taller than those from institutionalized samples at all ages throughout the growing period. Children with moderate or severe congenital heart disease on average were 1.5 to 2.0 cm shorter and about 1 kg lighter than those without or with only mild disease. Mean weight and weight divided by stature squared show that children with Down syndrome have a tendency to be overweight beginning in late infancy and throughout the remainder of the growing years.\r"

Three infants with this condition demonstrated persistent vomiting, poor weight gain, and recurrent pneumonias. Esophageal manometry demonstrated decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressures and low amplitude peristalsis; 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring revealed significant gastroesophageal reflux. Medical therapy was ineffective in relieving symptoms. After antireflux surgery, vomiting and respiratory symptoms ceased, and there was no longer significant gastroesophageal reflux during pH monitoring. Our experience indicates that in some infants with nemaline myopathy a severe form of gastroesophageal reflux develops that is not responsive to medical therapy. Early surgical intervention may decrease life-threatening complications associated with gastroesophageal reflux in these infants.\r"

Therefore, we studied the bioavailability of a commonly prescribed slow-release theophylline formulation (Slo-Bid Gyrocaps), administered twice daily by sprinkling the beads on applesauce. Serial measurements of serum theophylline concentrations were obtained during steady state in eight children (ages 1.6 to 5 years) after receiving a reference liquid theophylline product every six hours and also while receiving the slow-release product every 12 hours. The morning dose of slow-release theophylline was given before the child had eaten, and the evening dose was given two hours after supper. The extent of absorption of the slow-release product was 98.3 +/- 20.2% (mean +/- SD) relative to the liquid reference. The serum concentration fluctuations, expressed as percentage of the measured trough, did not differ between the two products: 108 +/- 59% v 129 +/- 97% (P greater than .05) for reference and slow-release products, respectively. Three of the eight patients had unacceptably large fluctuations (greater than 100%) while receiving the slow-release regimen, and two of these three had unacceptable fluctuations while receiving the liquid reference. The rate of absorption was slower after the evening dose of slow-release product (postprandial), resulting in significantly smaller fluctuations, and lower peak concentrations. Time to peak concentration while receiving the slow-release regimen varied from two to four hours after the evening dose and from two to eight hours after the morning dose. However, the average difference between the peak concentration and the four-hour measurement after the morning dose was only 0.3 microgram/mL (range 0 to 2.6 micrograms/mL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of erythrocyte and serum cholinesterase activity assays were concordant in 83% of patients. Thirty-four (92%) patients were treated with atropine and/or pralidoxime; three patients required only supportive care. Most patients had a prompt response to therapy; however, two patients with organophosphate toxicity required multiple doses of atropine during a 24-hour period; in both instances, the doses of atropine were subtherapeutic.

There is little information about the vitamin K1 (phylloquinone, present in green vegetables) and vitamin K2 (menaquinones, synthesized by intestinal flora) status of newborn infants. In this study during the first week of life vitamin K status was assessed by measuring serum concentrations of phylloquinone in 23 mother-infant pairs at the time of birth. Maternal phylloquinone concentration (1.7 +/- 1.0 ng/mL, mean +/- SD) was significantly higher (P less than .02) than cord serum concentration (1.1 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). All infants were then given a standard 1-mg injection of vitamin K1. Ten infants were fed formula (containing 58 ng/mL of vitamin K1) and 13 were exclusively breast-fed. On day 5 of life, serum concentrations of vitamin K1 did not differ between breast-fed (21.0 +/- 12.4 ng/mL) and formula-fed (27.5 +/- 9.7 ng/mL) infants, reflecting the large amounts of parenteral vitamin K1 at birth. During the first week of life, formula-fed infants had much higher fecal concentrations of vitamin K1 (due to large oral intake) and more significant quantities (greater than or equal to 200 pmol/g of dry weight) of fecal menaquinones (reflecting differences in bacterial flora) than did breast-fed infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three categories of response were identified: nonsupportive, supportive without emotional changes, and supportive with emotional changes. Nonsupportive mothers (n = 32) believed that the abuse complaint was a lie, a misunderstanding, or the child's fault. They rarely considered pressing charges or requested counseling. Supportive mothers (n = 71) believed that the child was telling the truth and that the assailant was primarily responsible. Anger, fear, anxiety, and guilt were commonly expressed. Thirty-nine of the supportive mothers reported behavior or mood changes including sleep, appetite, or somatic complaints and recurrent crying. Most were pressing charges (79%) and sought counseling for themselves (74%) and their children (82%). The 32 supportive mothers without behavior or mood changes also frequently pressed charges (88%) but sought counseling for themselves (6%) and the children (53%) less often (P less than .001). Individual personality and coping mechanisms may determine the maternal response. Maternal emotional responses do not appear to be related to variable features of the abuse situation but are significantly related to the approach to subsequent psychologic and legal issues.\r"

Heating human globules removed the filaments that were identified as high molecular weight glycoproteins by freeze-etch and gel electrophoretic analysis of the heating medium. Extraction of these globule glycoproteins was slight at 60 degrees C for one minute but substantial and tending to plateau at 80 degrees C for one minute. Such heat-induced alterations of the milk fat globule surface provide an alternative or additional explanation to milk lipase inactivation as the cause of reduced milk fat absorption from heated milk by the preterm infant.\r"

Two thirds (65) of the patients remained hospitalized greater than three days. Prolonged hospitalization could have been predicted for 40 of the 65 patients (61.5%) based on the need for intubation and ventilation on admission (14 patients) or the presence of underlying cardiac or respiratory disease (28 patients). Of the infants hospitalized when they were less than 2 months of age, 40% required intubation and mechanical ventilation, although only 16% had underlying cardiac or respiratory disease. Mechanical ventilation was required at the time of admission or subsequently for 14% (5/36) of the 2- to 4-month-old infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection. Among the 56 patients without underlying cardiac or respiratory disease who did not require intubation at the time of admission, 25 (45%) remained hospitalized longer than three days (mean hospital stay for these 25 patients, regardless of age, was six days). Neither the respiratory rate nor the presence or absence of fever on admission was useful in predicting the likelihood of a longer hospital stay for the patients who did not require intubation. In addition, none of the initial laboratory data, including the WBC count, the percentage of band forms or polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the presence or absence of hypoxia, or the chest x-ray film findings could be correlated with a longer or shorter duration of hospitalization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Women were grouped for this analysis according to the levels of caloric supplementation that they received (high or low) during two consecutive pregnancies and the period between them. The supplement also contained minerals and vitamins. Data were analyzed adjusting for maternal height, birth interval, parity, length of lactation, socioeconomic status, birth weight of the first offspring, gestational age of the second offspring, and caloric supplementation, expressed either in continuous fashion (total intake) or as caloric supplementation per week. The adjusted mean birth weights of the second offspring of women with high supplementation during two pregnancies (about an extra 180 kcal/d), and the in-between lactation period (about an extra 245 kcal/d), were up to 301 g greater than that of the low supplementation group. Women with high supplementation while breast-feeding their first offsprings and during their second pregnancies had babies up to 150 g heavier than the reference group; those mothers with high supplementation only during the second pregnancy had infants about 124 g heavier than those of the low supplementation group. Therefore, high supplementation during two consecutive pregnancies and their intervening lactation period among chronically, yet moderately, malnourished women was capable of increasing the mean birth weight to levels closer to those reported for industrialized populations. The mean birth weight increase is between two and three times greater than the effect shown in almost all of the previous studies of this topic.\r"

The rate of hospitalization for first episodes of respiratory infections during the first 18 months of life for the artificially fed infants was 18.0% v 11.2% for the breast-fed infants (P less than .01). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the adverse effect of artificial feeding on the hospitalization rate for respiratory infections was independent of birth weight, father's education, passive smoking, and any case(s) of chronic respiratory disease in the family. The adjusted odds ratio for the artificially fed infants compared with the breast-fed infants was 2.11.

Most of the patients were white (92%), girls (82%), and 16 to 18 years of age (63%) and had parents who graduated from high school (59%) or college (28%). They reported higher rates of participation in health-risk behaviors, including smoking (50%), drinking (60%), drug use (67%), and sexual intercourse (83%), than their peers. Seventy-two percent of the patients sought medical attention for sexuality-related or gynecologic concerns, including contraception (39%), pregnancy determination (20%), and evaluation of possible sexually transmitted disease (9%), and 28% sought attention for general medical or emotional needs, including checkups or immunizations (11%), nutritional or weight problems (4%), and emotional issues or substance abuse (4%). Management of sexuality-related issues differed from that reported in urban settings, whereas laboratory screening tests indicated that problems were similar to those in other settings. Many problems described in an initial survey of youth in the community were not seen at the adolescent health service. We conclude that a suburban-based health service may meet certain health care needs of the higher risk youth of the community but that ultimate care for adolescents remains with the private physicians in this setting.\r"

In contrast, injuries caused by abuse were commonly multiple and severe and were more likely to result in long-term disability. Results of this study indicate that unintentional injuries are rarely serious and that closed head injury, rib or lower extremity fractures, and abdominal injuries are usually indicative of abuse.\r"

Failure to use a car seat properly can contribute to serious injury or death of a child. A case study in which misuse of a car seat occurred is reported. The infant died of hemorrhage and shock secondary to liver laceration which resulted from excessive pressure over the abdomen sustained on impact. Surveys of car seat use for small children prior to and following a child restraint law are also reported. Observers noted types of car seats and specific forms of misuse. Survey results suggest that parents are more likely to misuse car seats for infants than toddlers. Medical professionals can reinforce the importance of proper car seat use by incorporating specific car seat use questions into the patient interview and by providing educational materials.\r"

When entered into with appropriate understanding and with reasonable expectations and goals, exercise can also be a major source of enjoyment. The role of the practitioner is to guide the patient to an appropriate level and intensity of exercise carried out in a suitable setting. In identifying the health habits and risk factors of the patient seeking clearance for an exercise program, physicians can do more than simply address the exercise issue. They can seize the opportunity to take a broader look at the patient's entire cardiovascular status and guide the patient into a generally beneficial program of health enhancement.\r"
