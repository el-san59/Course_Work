Following a structured diagnostic interview (SCID) at the end of the 3rd week of hospitalization, subjects were divided into two groups: a dual-diagnosed group (alcohol dependence and anxiety disorder) and an alcohol-only group (no other current Axis I diagnosis). The results demonstrated that the dual-diagnosed subjects experienced higher anxiety levels during and after acute alcohol withdrawal. All rating scales (i.e., Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Zung Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) were analyzed to obtain the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. Taken together, the results indicate that it may be possible to identify alcoholics who require additional psychiatric evaluation early in treatment. This would allow a treatment plan which could be used to address both psychiatric and substance abuse problems.\r"

Regional blood flow and cardiac output (CO) were measured by the reference microsphere technique. Mean arterial pressure and CO were significantly reduced 60 min after 3.0 g/kg and 4.0 g/kg of ethanol, while no changes occurred over time in total peripheral vascular resistance or heart rate. Acute ethanol administration produced an early non-sustained increase in portal vein blood flow, that was most pronounced after a low dose of ethanol, and was attenuated after the 3.0 g/kg and 4.0 g/kg doses of ethanol. The early increase in portal vein blood flow produced a corresponding increase in total liver blood flow. Additionally, we found increases in hepatic arterial blood flow after the higher doses. The combined increase in portal vein and hepatic arterial supply to the liver may serve to increase oxygen delivery, more than the singular increase in portal vein blood flow. This early increase in total liver blood flow after high doses of ethanol may be important for protecting hepatocyte function in the presence of high blood ethanol levels.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were maintained on liquid diets containing ethanol (35% of total calories) or an equicaloric volume of sucrose instead of ethanol for 10 wk. Vascular strips of isolated rat aortas were mounted in organ chambers to record isometric tension. Ethanol in vitro inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine and ATP in both pair-fed control and ethanol-fed rats. The inhibitory effect of ethanol was greater in the pair-fed rats. In addition, the magnitudes of these relaxation responses in the absence of ethanol in vitro in pair-fed rats were similar to those in the presence of ethanol in ethanol-fed rats. In the absence of ethanol in vitro, the relaxations in response to acetylcholine and ATP in the ethanol-fed rats were greater than in the pair-fed rats. These results suggest that chronic ethanol consumption can induce tolerance to ethanol-induced inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine and ATP, and that the relaxations can become adapted to the presence of plasma levels of ethanol, which may inhibit the relaxation in vivo. The augmented relaxation in the ethanol-fed rats may result from the mechanism causing tolerance to the inhibitory effect of ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "In man, acute ethanol administration decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), prolongs the duration, and lowers the amplitude of esophageal contractions. These changes may contribute to gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. To evaluate the underlying mechanisms of these changes an animal model is needed. Hence, we studied the effect of various doses of ethanol on esophageal motility in cats, an animal with an esophagus similar to man's. Similar to man, intravenous administration of ethanol significantly decreased LESP and amplitude of lower (smooth muscle portion) esophageal contractions. It also prolonged the duration of lower esophageal contractions, even through it had no effect on contraction velocity. The effect of ethanol on upper (striated muscle portion) esophagus was different. Ethanol had no effect on the amplitude of contractions, whereas it prolonged their duration and decreased their velocity. The effect of acute ethanol on LESP in four withdrawing alcoholic cats was similar to controls. However, the acute effect of ethanol on the esophageal contractions was less marked in alcoholics. Bilateral cervical vagotomy and intravenous injection of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin before the administration of ethanol did not prevent the effect of ethanol on LESP. This data suggests that cat esophagus is a good model for studying the underlying mechanisms of the effects of acute ethanol because its response is similar to the esophagus of man, and the acute effect of ethanol on LESP is not neurally mediated but is the result of its direct effect on muscle.\r"

Self-report data on average weekly alcohol consumption and self-ratings of intoxication after a standard dose of ethanol (0.75 g/kg body weight), used as an index of sensitivity, were obtained on 206 Australian twin pairs. Significant genetic covariance between weekly consumption and level of intoxication after alcohol intake was found in males, lower ratings of intoxication being associated with increased consumption. However, when direction of causation models were fitted to the male twin data, the hypothesis that decreased sensitivity was a cause of increased consumption was rejected. The major causal effect was that of weekly consumption on level of sensitivity. A similar, although nonsignificant, trend was observed in females. The strength of the association between self-report of average weekly consumption and level of intoxication after a standard dose of alcohol supports the validity of the former measure.\r"

The three ethanol diets all contained the same amount of ethanol-derived energy (36% of total energy), but differed in the amount of energy contributed by protein (17, 30, and 25%), fat (36, 24, and 13%), and carbohydrate (12, 10, and 27%), respectively. The experimental design also included dams that were pair-fed isocaloric ethanol-free versions of the three ethanol diets (designated BSP, RP6, and LDA, respectively) and a group of dams fed a pelleted casein-based solid diet (PC diet). All experimental diets were fed ad libitum from gestational day 7 to delivery. The effect of ethanol exposure in utero was most severe in mothers and offspring fed the BSA diet. The feed efficiency ratio (maternal weight gain/total dietary energy consumed) of this low-protein ethanol diet was less than that of RA6 or LDA diets. The feed efficiency ratio calculated for RA6 and LDA diets was not different from that of PC diet. Compared with rats fed RA6 and LDA diets, the rats that were fed BSA diet exhibited deficient maternal weight gain, greater parturition delay, impaired fetal growth, and increased perinatal mortality among the offspring. BSA dams had the highest blood ethanol levels of all groups fed ethanol diets, and exhibited the least difference in blood ethanol concentrations between the day (2 PM) and night (9 PM) periods of the diurnal cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The assays were also performed in a group of dependent individuals after a 1 month or longer period of abstinence. Marked increase in beta-hexosaminidase activity was observed in intoxicated patients. The activity decreased rapidly after the cessation of drinking, resembling the decrease in HDL cholesterol level in its dynamics. The alpha-mannosidase activity rise was less pronounced and its normalization was slow, similar to the GGT activity normalization rate. The rise of beta-hexosaminidase activity was mostly due to the thermostable component of the enzyme. Total beta-hexosaminidase or thermostable beta-hexosaminidase activity determinations appear to be simple and reliable markers of alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".W": "The hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides is widely recognized as an important signal transduction pathway in brain. One of the products of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ins(1,4,5)P3, is thought to participate in signal transduction by mobilizing intracellular calcium and it is now clear that Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolism is a complicated process that may be highly regulated. In addition to being dephosphorylated by the action of a 5-phosphatase, Ins(1,4,5)P3 can be phosphorylated by a 3-kinase to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Although the physiological significance of the higher inositol polyphosphates is not clear, recent evidence suggests that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 may also have important second messenger function. Since ethanol is known to have potent effects on synaptic transmission, we investigated the in vitro effects of ethanol on [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 metabolism by rat whole brain homogenates. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was rapidly hydrolyzed to Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol bisphosphates [Ins(3,4)P2 and Ins(1,3)P2], inositol monophosphates [Ins(1)P/Ins(3)P and Ins(4)P], and to inositol by sequential dephosphorylation. No [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 was detected. Ethanol (500 mM), significantly accelerated the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, resulting in a more rapid formation of inositol bisphosphates, monophosphates and inositol. However, intoxicating and sedative-hypnotic concentrations of ethanol (30-100 mM) had no effect upon Ins(1,3,4)P3 dephosphorylation, suggesting that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol do not directly effect the enzymes involved in the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to free inositol in brain.\r"

Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells and genotyping of ALDH2 was performed using the polymerase chain reaction technique and slot blot hybridization with synthesized oligonucleotide probes specific to the normal and mutant ALDH2 genes. ALDH2 activity was not detectable in the liver in two cases of the mutant homozygote. In four out of eight cases of the heterozygote, hepatic ALDH2 activity was measurable, although the activity was lower compared with that in the normal homozygote. Blood ethanol levels after alcohol administration were not different among the three different ALDH2 genotypes. Blood Ac-CHO levels after drinking of alcohol were significantly higher in the heterozygotes and the mutant homozygotes than in the normal homozygotes. The levels after a moderate amount of ethanol (0.8 g/kg of body weight) in a case of the mutant homozygote were not different from those of the heterozygotes. However, the levels after a small amount of ethanol (0.1 g/kg of body weight) were significantly higher in the mutant homozygotes than in the heterozygotes. These results indicate that hepatic ALDH2 activity is lacking completely, and metabolism of Ac-CHO in the liver is severely impaired in the homozygotes of the mutant ALDH2 genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats with a double dose of the allele--the salt-sensitive hypertensive rats--have low renin activity compared with the salt-resistant hypertensive rat that does not have this S-allele. Alcohol consumption in rats has also been shown to vary with renin activity, and the possible involvement of renin activity in the genetics of alcohol consumption was suggested by previous work showing that the alcohol-preferring P line of selected rats had low renin levels. In the present study we examined alcohol consumption in a group of inbred Dahl rats, which have a double dose of the S renin allele, and in a group of selected Dahl rats, which have only a single dose of this S-allele. After an initial acclimation period, these two groups were first given daily 1-hr access to ascending concentrations of alcohol (3%, 6%, 8% w/v) over a 34-day period followed by continuous access to alcohol for a further 10 days. Water and food were always available. Regardless of whether alcohol was rationed or continuously available, the rats with the double dose of the S-allele drank significantly more alcohol than the rats that had only a single dose of this allele. These findings suggest that genetically mediated alterations in the renin gene may exert a significant influence on alcohol consumption and may be a component in the etiology of alcoholism.\r"

Female, C57BL/6 mice given water (H2O) or ethanol (20% w/v, ETOH) ad libitum were placed in one of three dietary groups: unrestricted (UNR), moderately restricted (MR, 2.2 g/day), or severely restricted (SR, 1.8 g/day). Food restriction alone (MR, SR) significantly reduced body, spleen, and thymus weights; carcass lipid content (SR only); spleen cell number; and baseline and interleukin-2 (rIL-2) stimulated NK cell activities. Ethanol consumption was unaffected by food restriction and in restricted mice it did not suppress food intake. Thus, average calories derived from ethanol increased from 30% (UNR) to 40% (SR) with the degree of food restriction in these groups. Mice given ethanol and restricted food intake had at least as heavy or heavier body, spleen, and thymus weights than water-drinking (H2O) counterparts. Spleen cell number was reduced in ethanol-consuming (ETOH), food restricted groups compared with UNR H2O control. Baseline NK cell activity was suppressed 50% to 90% in all ETOH and food-restricted groups. rIL-2 stimulated NK cell activity was suppressed 18% to 76% in food restricted mice independent of ethanol intake. These results indicate that supplementary ethanol calories did not enhance NK cell activity in UNR ETOH mice, nor did they protect splenic NK cell activity from the suppressant effects of food restriction. Ethanol consumption significantly increased carcass lipid content in all groups compared with their H2O counterparts. This increase was largely responsible for the preservation of body weight in ETOH mice especially during food restriction.\r"

Changes in thermoregulatory responsiveness to a single injection of ethanol (EtOH) may occur during this period. Immature rats (2-3, 8-9, and 14-15 days of age) were administered either saline or EtOH (2 or 4 g/kg BW; ip) at thermoneutral ambient temperatures (Ta). In one experiment, metabolic rate (MR) and body temperatures (colonic and skin) were recorded for 1-3 hr postinjection. A second experiment determined blood EtOH concentration in rats from the 3 age groups over an 8-hr period following injection of EtOH. 4 g EtOH/kg produced few significant reductions in thermoregulatory function of 2-3 day-old rats, but decreased MR by 16% and colonic temperature by 0.5-0.7 degrees C in 8-15 day-old animals. 2 g EtOH/kg had no effect on 8-9 day-old rats, but reduced MR and colonic temperature in rats aged 14-15 days. In every case, the hypothermic response to EtOH was correlated with a reduction in MR. Back and abdominal skin temperatures decreased with colonic temperature, and tail skin temperature indicated EtOH-induced vasoconstriction in older rats. Blood EtOH concentrations were similar in the three age groups during the first 2 hr postinjection and did not explain differences in metabolic response. The magnitude and duration of thermoregulatory responsiveness to EtOH increases with age in the immature rat.\r"

Since computer interactive (CI) programs allow for individualization, feedback, and active learning, we were interested in determining whether CI would prove to be a more effective educational/treatment modality for male alcoholic patients than the conventional videotape (V) modality. The current study compared the relative effectiveness of the CI and V educational interventions for VA alcoholic patients and a cognitively and sociodemographically matched sample of nonalcoholic VA patients. The 91 male alcoholic subjects (46 V, 45 CI) were lower socioeconomic outpatients in a VA Alcoholism Treatment program. Control subjects were 35 nonalcoholic men (18 V, 17 CI) attending an outpatient medical clinic at the same facility. All subjects were individually exposed in a single session to a 1 hr intervention on the Medical Effects of Alcohol. Baseline knowledge was measured prior to the intervention using a 21-item multiple choice test, while learning and retention were assessed with the same instrument 24 hr after the intervention. All four subgroups (two types of subjects x two types of intervention) identified approximately three more items correctly at the post-test than at baseline. Thus, neither alcoholics for nonalcoholics acquired more information when exposed to the CI intervention. Further, no differences were found overall in the learning of the alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. The implications of these findings and their limitations are discussed.\r"

The persistence of growth effects at age 3 suggests that children exposed to alcohol prenatally may have a diminished capacity for growth.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was conducted to determine whether the antisecretory agents colchicine and ethanol affect the intracellular degradation of plasma proteins in rat liver. Plasma proteins were prelabeled in vivo with [3H]leucine and their levels were monitored immunochemically in both the medium and extracts of rat liver slices incubated alone or in the presence of 50 microM colchicine or 25 mM ethanol. Compared with those left untreated, colchicine-treated slices had a 40-55% lower secretory capacity and, at one point, showed significant hepatocellular retention of total plasma proteins. Plasma protein secretion by ethanol-treated liver slices was 22-32% lower than controls, but there was no detectable retention of unsecreted plasma proteins in the ethanol-treated liver tissue. In all experiments, the total radioactivity in plasma proteins (i.e., the immunoprecipitable radioactivity in the liver plus that in the medium) decreased with time in a manner suggestive of intracellular degradation. Regression analyses of the rates of degradation of presecretory proteins revealed that compared with controls, plasma protein catabolism was accelerated 57% in colchicine-treated slices. In ethanol-treated liver slices, there was a 50% increase in the degradation of total plasma proteins and a 46% increase in albumin catabolism. In all cases, degradation was intracellular. These findings indicate that inhibition of hepatic protein secretion by either colchicine or ethanol is associated with accelerated catabolism of unsecreted plasma proteins, suggesting that hepatocellular degradative processes are responsive to changes in the levels of presecretory proteins and/or perturbations of the secretory process.\r"

  ".W": "The vasopressin analog desglycinamide-(Arg8)-vasopressin (DGAVP) has been reported to reduce the acquisition of heroin and cocaine self-injection behavior in rats. This led to the hypothesis that DGAVP can reduce the self-administration of psycho-active drugs (including ethanol) by attenuating central reinforcement processes. Under forced ingestion conditions, DGAVP has been reported, however, to enhance alcohol drinking in rats. We studied the effect of DGAVP on the acquisition of voluntary, free-choice alcohol drinking in naive rhesus monkeys, that had concurrent access to either 1% and 2% (n = 12) or to 4% and 8% (n = 8) ethanol/water solutions in addition to drinking water. Half of the monkeys were injected twice per day with 50 micrograms.kg-1 of DGAVP for 14 successive days, the other half received placebo. Subsequently, all subjects had access to the same solutions for another 14 days without treatment. DGAVP did not significantly affect concentration preference behavior. With regard to net ethanol ingestion in animals drinking 1% and 2% solutions, DGAVP decreased net ethanol intakes, having a time-dependent and long lasting effect; placebo-treated animals gradually increased net ethanol intakes over time. The placebo-treated animals in the 4% and 8% group, showed a different acquisition pattern; DGAVP reduced net ethanol intake in two animals in a similar way as above. Two animals behaved differently. It is concluded that in a free-choice condition DGAVP did not enhance the acquisition of alcohol drinking in monkeys, but rather inhibited ethanol self-administration in the majority of the subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Alcohol preference and hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity in adult rats are known to be sexually dimorphic. Intrauterine sibling contiguity (the intrauterine position of a fetus relative to adjacent siblings of the same or opposite sex) alters selected reproductive, behavioral and enzymatic sexual dimorphisms via intersibling sex hormone transfer. We postulated that sibling contiguity would affect alcohol preference and hepatic alcohol metabolism in adult rats. The results of our study demonstrate that adult mMm male Long-Evans rats (genetic male rat developing in utero between two male siblings) had significantly lower ethanol preference, attained higher blood alcohol levels after standard ethanol \"challenge\" doses and had significantly lower hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity than either male siblings developing in utero between two females (fMf) or genetic females developing between two males or between two females (mFm or fFf). Hepatic cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was higher in adult female than male rats regardless of nearest neighbor siblings. It is suggested that the differences in ethanol preference and hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity between the adult mMm and fMf male rats is due to differences in prenatal hormonal environment which can modulate sexual dimorphisms in alcohol intake and metabolism in the adult.\r"

The results of this study demonstrated that the replacement of degenerative nigrostriatal neurons with new dopamine-producing cells by adrenal brain transplants in patients with Parkinson's disease resulted in significant increase (p less than 0.05) in CSF levels of free dopamine, dopamine sulfate, free salsolinol, and salsolinol sulfate as compared with preoperative levels. Moreover, the oral administration of L-dopa to these transplanted patients caused substantial (p less than 0.001) elevation in CSF levels of free dopamine (before L-dopa, 146 +/- 57 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 575 +/- 207 pg/ml), dopamine sulfate (before L-dopa, 1966 +/- 945 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 41679 +/- 29326 pg/ml), free salsolinol (before L-dopa, 43 +/- 29 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 186 +/- 90 pg/ml), and salsolinol sulfate (before L-dopa, 405 +/- 477 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 2908 +/- 2572 pg/ml), respectively.\r"

Alanine was infused to obtain a constant blood concentration of alpha-amino nitrogen between 7.3 and 11.7 mmol/l, at which concentrations urea synthesis is at maximum. CUNS was calculated after nephrectomy as accumulation of urea in body water, elimination of alanine as alanine infusion rate corrected for accumulation, and nitrogen retention as the difference. In the fed state ethanol decreased CUNS from 7.84 +/- 0.32 mumol N/(min 100 g body weight (BW] (mean +/- SEM) (n = 7) to 6.30 +/- 0.58 (n = 6) (p less than 0.001) and in the fasted state from 8.25 +/- 0.27 mumol N/(min 100 g BW) (n = 10) to 6.90 +/- 0.25 (n = 10) (p less than 0.001).

If this is so, the pharmacological breadth of addiction risk conferred by a positive family alcoholism history might be studied by determining whether FHP subjects show different responses than FHN to drug classes other than alcohol. We have previously reported on the acute effects of ethanol as compared with secobarbital in FHP and FHN subjects and found that FHP subjects showed greater sensitivity across a variety of subjective measures than FHN subjects for both drug classes. The data reported here are based on an extended data collection period of 3 to 18 hr postingestion, following completion of the acute laboratory portion of the study. Specifically, in the present study, dose-effect timecourse functions for a variety of physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, and breath alcohol level), subjective (analog mood, drug effect, and withdrawal, Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS], and psychomotor measures (Digit Symbol Substitution Test and numeric recall) were examined in FHP and FHN college-aged males for secobarbital (0, 100, 200 mg daily) and ethanol (1 g/kg daily). FHP and FHN subjects were matched on light-to-moderate drinking patterns, anthropometric dimensions, age, years of schooling, and drug use. FHP subjects reported more extended intoxication and greater withdrawal effects following both ethanol and the high dose of secobarbital than did FHN subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All readings were then compared with directly measured arterial blood oxygen saturations. The mean difference (bias, 'accuracy'), standard deviation (precision) and 'drop out' rate for each pulse oximeter combination was determined. An overall ranking of performance of each pulse oximeter was calculated using five criteria (accuracy, precision, number of readings within 3% of standard, percentage of readings given within 3% of standard, expected overread limit in 95% of cases). Nose and forehead probes performed poorly. Some ear probes performed well compared to some finger probes, but the overall performance of probes in other sites compared to finger probes was worse, (p = 0.05). Two of eight ear probes and no nose or forehead probes would be expected to be within 4% of the reference value in 95% of readings. The use of finger probes rather than probes in other sites is recommended in the patient with poor peripheral perfusion.\r"

The heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure and Holter ECG was monitored in all patients. Significant increases in heart rate (p less than 0.05), systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (p less than 0.01) occurred in the thiopentone only group, following bronchoscopy. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressure decreased in patients receiving thiopentone plus alfentanil, following induction of anaesthesia and laryngoscopy (p less than 0.05). No significant haemodynamic changes were seen in either of the groups which received propofol. ST segment changes on subsequent Holter analysis were seen in four patients, but there were no significant differences between the groups. Anaesthesia with propofol alone provides adequate haemodynamic stability for bronchoscopy and the addition is superfluous.\r"

A compound muscle action potential was monitored continuously throughout anaesthesia, using an electromyograph and the train-of-four twitch technique. The rate of onset and maximum block achieved were similar in both the young and elderly patients, as were the times to 20% recovery of the first twitch compared with control (T1 : T0) and fourth twitch compared with the first, (T4 : T1). In contrast, the time to 70% recovery of T1 : T0 was significantly prolonged in the elderly (138 as compared with 89 minutes: p less than 0.01) as was the recovery index (25-75%) for T1 : T0 (95 as compared with 46 minutes: p less than 0.01) and the time to 70% recovery of T4 : T1 (181 as compared with 131 minutes: p less than 0.05).

Methaemoglobin causes the pulse oximeter readout to tend towards 85%. Fetal haemoglobin and bilirubin introduce no significant error, although they may interfere with in vitro measurements. Skin pigmentation can result in a slight decrease in accuracy. Nail polish may cause up to 6% underestimation of saturation; it is recommended that probes should be mounted sideways on fingers with nail polish or long nails. Adhesive tape or a vinyl glove across the probe has no demonstrable effect on accuracy. A blood sample should be analysed by a multiwavelength in vitro oximeter when an erroneous pulse oximeter reading is suspected, although errors may be introduced in the in vitro reading by fetal haemoglobin, bilirubin and intravenous dyes.\r"

The deadspace, measured by volume displacement, was 12 ml, similar to that of a standard catheter mount for paediatric use. Pressure drop across the device was measured at several different flows in five samples of the device in both the dry and wet state. Calculated resistance proved to be markedly lower when compared with that of other anaesthetic equipment such as tracheal tubes, and with similar humidification devices for paediatric use.\r"

Guide marks were printed at variable distances proximal to the tube cuffs, and during intubation the guide mark was positioned at the level of the vocal cords. The distance between the bevel end of the tube and the carina was determined with a fibreoptic bronchoscope. The mean distance between the tip of the tracheal tube and the carina varied between 3.7 and 4.1 cm with the head in the neutral position. The tip of the tracheal tube approaches the carina by a mean distance of 0.5 cm when the head is moved from the extended position to the neutral position. It is recommended that a guide mark be placed 2.5 cm from the proximal end of the cuff in tubes used for adult males and 2.25 cm in tubes used for adult females. The use of guide marks is a simple, safe and reliable method for correct tracheal tube placement.\r"

The two groups were comparable in age, weight and duration of surgery and there were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to onset, pattern or degree of sensory loss. The degree of motor loss was also comparable. The group L patients had a statistically significant longer duration of sensory loss than those in group P. All the blocks were performed using the same technique and provided complete surgical anaesthesia.

A prospective trial was conducted comparing real-time ultrasound with contrast venography in the diagnosis of proximal DVT. METHODS: Seventy patients whose clinical presentations mandated diagnostic evaluation for DVT had real-time ultrasound of the involved leg followed by contrast venography. Initial readings of ultrasound and venography were compared with each other and with final readings to assess reliability of interpretation. RESULTS: Final ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in all patients. Negative initial ultrasound readings agreed with final venogram readings in 56 of 56 patients (negative predictive value, 100%; 95% confidence interval, 94 to 100). Eighteen patients had positive initial ultrasound readings compared with 14 who had positive final venogram readings (positive predictive value, 78%; 95% confidence interval, 55 to 91). CONCLUSION: Negative real-time ultrasonography reliably excludes proximal DVT. Positive ultrasound reliably diagnoses proximal DVT only in experienced hands.\r"

MAIN RESULTS: All patients with negative venograms had no suggestion of DVT on MRI scan. Two of these patients had other significant demonstrable abnormalities. Four of the five patients with positive venograms had positive calf MRI scans. One patient with a venogram that was difficult to interpret had no DVT on MRI. A thigh DVT was seen on his venogram and was suggested by MRI findings. CONCLUSION: MRI may replace ascending venography as the standard for diagnosis of calf DVT.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective study; trauma registry and medical records. SETTING: Level I regional trauma center serving a population of 2.3 million. PARTICIPANTS: Adult victims of blunt trauma more than 17 years old, admitted between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, with suspected blunt abdominal injury and serum ethanol of more than 100 mg/dL and Glasgow Coma Score of 15. INTERVENTION: All patients had serum ethanol levels measured in mg/dL and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and/or diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). RESULTS: Criteria were met by 92 patients. Eighty-nine underwent CT scans, two had DPL, and one had both. Of 17 patients complaining of abdominal pain and/or tenderness on palpation, six (35.3%) had blood in the peritoneal cavity demonstrated by CT scan or DPL and underwent celiotomy. All 75 patients without abdominal pain or tenderness had negative CT scan or DPL, with no missed injury. CONCLUSION: In the intoxicated blunt trauma patient with normal mentation, the physical examination is a reliable indicator of abdominal injury. Elevated alcohol level, per se, should not be considered an absolute indication for DPL or abdominal CT.\r"

SETTING: University-affiliated community hospital. METHODS: 252 patients with abdominal pain who were examined underwent short-term (10.4 hours) observation (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7, 12.1) before the decision to operate during a one-year period. Alvarado's scoring system and a probability-of-diagnosis nomogram were used to assign scores and estimate probability of appendicitis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In the study group, mean score of patients with appendicitis increased after observation from 6.8 (95% CI, 6.2, 7.4) to 7.8 (95% CI, 7.3, 8.3), corresponding to a change in probability of appendicitis from 50% to 65%. Mean score of patients without appendicitis decreased from 3.8 (95% CI, 3.5, 4.1) to 1.6 (95% CI, 1.58, 1.62), corresponding to a change in probability from 35% to 22%. The difference between mean scores for patients with and without appendicitis increased from 2.6 (95% CI, 2.0, 3.2) to 6.2 (95% CI, 6.15, 6.25) during observation. The study group initially had intermediate probability of appendicitis (score, 4.35; 95% CI, 4.04, 4.66) compared with high probability for patients who went directly to surgery after their initial evaluation (63 patients; score, 7.59; 95% CI, 7.05, 8.73) and low probability for patients with abdominal pain who were sent home after their initial evaluation without observation or surgery (2,097 patients; score, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.48, 2.26). CONCLUSION: In this group of patients with intermediate initial probability of appendicitis, observation improved the ability to distinguish patients with from those without appendicitis.\r"

STUDY POPULATION: Fifty-seven patients admitted during a two-year period to an inner-city hospital for severe oral phenytoin overdose, which is defined as a peak level of 40 micrograms/mL or more. METHODS: Case records were reviewed retrospectively for symptoms and signs of phenytoin toxicity, especially circulatory effects. Baseline and toxic 12-lead ECGs, when available, were reviewed in detail. Continuous variables were compared using either paired or unpaired t tests, as appropriate. Significance was taken as P less than or equal to .05. RESULTS: Mean peak phenytoin level was 49.4 +/- 7.7 micrograms/mL. Continuous single-lead ECG monitoring in 36 patients (63%) for a mean of 26.5 +/- 21.6 hours revealed no incidents of dysrhythmia requiring treatment. ECGs recorded during toxicity in 52 cases (91%) revealed no clinically significant abnormalities attributable to phenytoin. ECGs during toxic and baseline states were available for detailed analysis in 15 cases. Ten patients exhibited an increase in PR interval (mean, 19 +/- 10 ms) when toxic, whereas five had a decrease (mean, 18 +/- 11 ms) compared with nontoxic records. No change in heart rate, QRS duration, or corrected QT interval was observed. There were no circulatory complications and no deaths. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular toxicity is rarely a manifestation of oral phenytoin overdose. Routine management of stable patients with severe phenytoin overdose in a monitored setting is not mandatory.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The two groups were similar on entry into the study, including mean FEV1 measurements (0.70 L atropine/0.60 L metaproterenol, P greater than .05). Compared with baseline, The FEV1 improvement for the metaproterenol group was statistically significant (+ 0.18 L, P = .05; + 31%, P less than .05), whereas the improvement with atropine did not reach significance (+0.09 L or +10%, P greater than .05). Comparing the two groups, statistically significant differences favoring metaproterenol were found in the percent improvement in the FEV1 (+10% atropine/+31% metaproterenol, P less than .05) and in the percentage of patients experiencing at least a 15% decrease in their FEV1 below baseline (35% atropine/10% metaproterenol, P less than .05). No patient suffered adverse side effects. CONCLUSION: For the majority of adults with refractory status asthmaticus, an additional beta-adrenergic inhalation treatment results in greater FEV1 improvement than that resulting from the addition of an atropine inhalation.\r"

A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of adequate size was designed to assess the efficacy of phenytoin in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. METHODS: Fifty-five patients who had seized from alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment with IV phenytoin or placebo. Patients with known seizure disorders and those receiving any anticonvulsant were excluded. The study was terminated after seizure recurrence or passage of a six-hour, high-risk seizure interval. RESULTS: Six of 28 phenytoin-treated patients (21%) had recurrent seizures compared with five of 27 placebo-treated patients (19%). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response probabilities was +16% to -20%. There was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (P greater than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin does not show significant benefit over placebo in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures.\r"

Recently, there have been several reports of complications due to this intervention. The role of this pharmacologic curiosity in the management of the acutely poisoned patient requires reassessment.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective laboratory investigation. SETTING: A certified regional poison control center. PARTICIPANTS: Six healthy adult male volunteers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All volunteers ingested 20 mg/kg of elemental iron. Blood samples were drawn at hourly intervals for eight hours and analyzed for serum iron, TIBC, transferrin, ferritin, lactoferrin, glucose, bicarbonate, and WBC. Within two hours of ingestion, subjects developed symptoms of toxicity, including nausea, lightheadedness, vomiting, severe crampy abdominal pain, and voluminous diarrhea. The TIBC was statistically significantly increased at all points measured from one to six hours. Despite rising above 300 micrograms/dL in five of six subjects, the serum iron never exceeded the TIBC in any subject. Transferrin and ferritin did not increase to account for the increased TIBC. The lactoferrin levels did increase, but they did not correlate with significant increases in the TIBC. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty mg/kg of elemental iron caused clinical toxicity in this study, and after iron overload the colorimetric TIBC increased by unknown mechanisms.\r"

METHODS: In a two-phase, crossover protocol, ten normal volunteers ingested in each phase 0.80 mEq/kg sustained-release lithium carbonate. In the second phase, WBI was begun one hour after lithium ingestion, and 10 L of polyethylene glycol solution were administered over five hours. Serum samples were collected every half hour for six hours, every hour for an additional six hours, and then every 24 hours for as long as 72 hours after ingestion. These samples were analyzed for lithium concentration. The area under the lithium serum concentration-versus-time curve was calculated for each phase. RESULTS: The average area under the lithium serum concentration-versus-time curve in the WBI phase was 67% +/- 11% less than that in the control phase (P less than .0005 using a two-tailed Student's t test). The mean serum lithium concentration was significantly decreased (P = .03) within one hour of beginning WBI. CONCLUSION: WBI is an effective treatment for acute ingestion of sustained-release lithium. We recommend it as the decontaminant procedure of choice in this situation.\r"

Although verapamil is widely used as the drug of choice for PSVT with a narrow QRS complex in a hemodynamically stable patient, the acute IV use of verapamil during pregnancy has not been well studied. Only a limited number of case reports document its safety and efficacy in the treatment of maternal or fetal PSVT. In general, the use of medication during pregnancy requires careful assessment of both the maternal and fetal risks versus benefits and documentation of patient consent. Because it crosses the placenta, one of the major concerns with the acute use of IV verapamil centers around the drug's potential effect on fetal heart rate. The case we present describes the occurrence of PSVT on two separate occasions in a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy. In both episodes, as much as 10 mg IV verapamil was given with resulting successful conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Fetal heart monitoring during drug administration failed to show significant change in fetal heart rate.\r"

This side effect has been previously reported with all ACE inhibitors, but its incidence and potential for a fatal outcome may not be fully appreciated. A review of the literature reveals 227 reports of this reaction with an overall incidence of approximately 0.1% to 0.2%. The etiology is nonimmunogenic and thought to be related to accentuated bradykinin activity. There is no clinical profile that identifies patients at increased risk for this side effect. There are unique clinical characteristics to this idiosyncratic reaction: angioedema may suddenly occur even though the drug has been well tolerated for months or years; symptoms may regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis; the pathology has a special predilection for the tongue, a circumstance that renders orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation difficult; symptoms may progress rapidly despite aggressive medical therapy, necessitating emergency airway procedures; and a rebound phenomenon following successful medical therapy has been described. We recommend intensive medical treatment before angioedema is severe enough to thwart standard methods to ensure a protected airway. Once even minor angioedema is attributed to an ACE inhibitor, an alternative class of antihypertensive medication should be chosen. Individuals with a history of idiopathic angioedema probably should not be given ACE inhibitors.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the mechanism of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma, serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) was measured in normal individuals and patients with asthma before and 5 min after bronchoprovocation testing with adenosine. Challenge testing was terminated when the FEV1 fell by 20% or a concentration of 10 mg/ml was reached. Participants were separated into three groups: six asthmatics hyperresponsive to adenosine (Group 1), seven asthmatics hyperresponsive to histamine but not adenosine (Group 2), and six normal subjects (Group 3). The mean percentage increase in NCA was 84% for Group 1 (p less than 0.001), 29% for Group 2 (p less than 0.05), and only 13% for Group 3. No significant increase in NCA was observed after histamine challenge in seven individuals with asthma derived from Groups 1 and 2. Four patients from Group 1 were rechallenged after treatment with therapeutic doses of oral theophylline. Theophylline therapy was associated with a significant attenuation of the increase in NCA at the concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% decrease in FEV1 before treatment (18% versus 84%, p less than 0.01). The concentration of adenosine which caused a 20% drop in FEV1 was increased at least twofold for each of the four patients. Analysis of NCA by gel filtration chromatography demonstrated an increase in a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor in the serum of two Group 1 patients after adenosine challenge. Release of a high molecular weight neutrophil chemotactic factor is consistent with a mast cell source for inflammatory mediators in adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. The therapeutic effects of theophylline, a potent adenosine antagonist, in asthma may therefore occur in part through the inhibition of this process.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes, products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in the metabolism of arachidonic acid, are potent mediators of airway microvascular leakage and smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. We studied the effect of a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-63162, on airway microvascular leakage and airflow obstruction following inhaled ovalbumin in actively sensitized guinea pigs. Airway microvascular leakage was assessed by extravasation of Evans blue dye into airway tissues. Inhaled ovalbumin caused increased lung resistance (RL) with decreased dynamic compliance (CL) and increased extravasation of Evans blue dye at all airway levels. A-63162 reduced the changes in RL and CL at 1.0 mumol/kg (p less than 0.05) but not at lower doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mumol/kg. A-63162 reduced Evans blue dye extravasation in airway tissues at all three doses, however, being most effective in the distal airways (p less than 0.01), and these reductions were greater than those in RL and CL. A 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor thus reduced airway microvascular leakage to a greater extent than airflow obstruction, suggesting that leukotrienes have a larger contribution to changes in airway microvascular permeability than smooth muscle contraction following inhaled allergen challenge in actively sensitized guinea pigs in vivo.\r"

In addition, binding studies with (3H) dexamethasone have been performed to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and receptor numbers (Ro) in the monocytes of these two groups of subjects. The concentration of corticosteroid producing 50% inhibition (IC50) was 600 nM, 70 nM, and 0.5 nM for hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, respectively, in monocytes from CS individuals. There was only weak inhibition of the generation of enhancing activity by the corticosteroids in the CR asthmatic individuals. The dexamethasone Kd was 2.45 +/- 0.58 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CS group and 1.6 +/- 0.35 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CR group of patients (p = 0.14). The Ro in the CS group was 3,605 +/- 984 binding sites per nucleus (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) and 4,757 +/- 692 binding sites per nucleus (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) in the CR group (p = 0.23). These findings indicate that corticosteroid resistance in bronchial asthma cannot be explained by abnormalities in corticosteroid receptor characteristics.\r"

Further, there was a mean fourfold increase in urinary LTE4 levels at 3 to 6 h after aspirin, but not placebo, challenge in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects that was not seen in the control asthmatic individuals. Leukotriene release may play a central role in the mechanisms of asthmatic attacks produced by aspirin ingestion.\r"

  ".W": "Standard pulmonary function and mechanics studies were done in eight female patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis diagnosed by open-lung biopsy. Five patients were studied before hormone treatment. The mean age of the patients was 40 +/- 3 (SEM) years. Two of the eight had a smoking history of 10 pack-years or more, but all had quit smoking several years before evaluation. There was a trend toward increased total lung capacity (114 +/- 7% expressed as mean of percentage predicted +/- SEM) and increased residual volume (207 +/- 24%). Of the eight patients seven had expiratory obstruction as evidenced by the reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio [( FEV1/FVC] 61 +/- 6%). Steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was reduced in seven of the patients (57 +/- 12%). Pulmonary mechanics studies performed in a body plethysmograph revealed a modest reduction in retractive force both at total lung capacity and at 90% total lung capacity (67 +/- 10 and 59 +/- 9%, respectively). Static compliance tended to be increased (128 +/- 19%). Pulmonary flow resistance was markedly elevated (266 +/- 46%). Maximal flow-static recoll curves revealed that in the seven patients with expiratory obstruction the cause was predominantly airway narrowing rather than loss of lung elastic forces. We conclude that in this group of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis there was no evidence for significant restriction. Although there was some decrease in retractive force consistent with emphysema, expiratory flows were reduced predominantly because of airway narrowing or obstruction rather than loss of pulmonary elastic recoil forces.\r"

Metered-dose inhalers of metaproterenol maintained at the experimental temperatures were activated in the mouth of the model at the onset of inspiration. We measured the amount of drug released and that which was able to penetrate the model at each temperature. At low canister temperatures considerably more drug was released than at higher temperatures. However, at higher temperatures much more drug was able to traverse the upper airway, raising lower airway deposition from 17.7% at 4 degrees C to 32.2% at 37 degrees C. Aerosol size became progressively smaller as temperature was raised: mass median diameter (MMD) was 3.65 microns at 0 degrees C and 2.50 microns at 37 degrees C. These findings are most likely due to greater canister vapor pressures at higher temperatures. We conclude that patients should probably be instructed to prewarm metered-dose inhaler canisters prior to use when canister temperatures are low.\r"

  ".W": "A great deal of experimental evidence suggests that emphysema in smokers is caused by the action of neutrophil elastase on lung elastin. In order to test this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a drug that reduces the load of neutrophil elastase in the lungs of patients with emphysema. In a previous study we treated smokers with emphysema with colchicine, a drug that prevents neutrophil elastase secretion, to determine if it would reduce the elastase burden in the lungs. Colchicine was unable to reduce the elastase load while the stimulus of smoking continued. In this study we treated ex-smokers with emphysema to determine if colchicine could reduce the elastase burden in the lungs. The objective of the study was to determine if colchicine can reduce the elastase load and putative indicators of elastase load in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. The subjects were outpatients seeking treatment at the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler. We studied 16 ex-cigarette smokers between 45 and 75 yr of age with lung disease defined by FEV1 less than 70% of predicted but greater than 1.2 L whose airflow obstruction was less than 20% reversible with bronchodilators. Colchicine or placebo was taken by mouth in disguised capsules, 0.6 mg three times per day. Volunteers were placed on a baseline bronchodilator regimen of theodur by mouth and albuterol by inhalation. Blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were obtained after 1 wk of stabilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen ventilator-dependent premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the effects of 3 days of intravenously administered dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg/day) on pulmonary function, pulmonary inflammation, and the requirement for respiratory support (FIO2, ventilator peak pressure [PP], and respiratory rate [RR]). Assessment of pulmonary function included measurement of FVC, flow at 25% vital capacity (V25), and static compliance of the respiratory system (Crs), whereas pulmonary inflammation was assessed by the neutrophil count, ratio of elastase/2 x alpha-1-antitrypsin, and the concentrations of albumin and fibronectin in the tracheobronchial lavage (TBL) fluid. After 3 days of placebo treatment there were no significant changes in any of the measured parameters. In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated group demonstrated a significant decrease in respiratory support (FIO2: 50 versus 36%; PP: 21 versus 16 cm H2O; RR: 22 versus 14 breaths/min) and improved pulmonary function (Crs: 0.63 versus 0.85 ml/cm H2O/kg; V25: 23 versus 68 ml/s/kg). In addition, pulmonary inflammation was suppressed in the dexamethasone-treated group (neutrophils: 23 versus 11 x 10(4)/mg albumin: elastase/2 x alpha-1-antitrypsin: 0.24 versus 0.10; albumin: 7.1 versus 3.5 mg/dl; fibronectin: 33 versus 17 micrograms/mg albumin). We conclude that short-term treatment with dexamethasone improves pulmonary function and suppresses pulmonary inflammation as well as decreasing the respiratory support required by ventilator-dependent premature infants with BPD.\r"

To evaluate the accuracy of a simple and inexpensive sampling device in this setting, we compared quantitative cultures of paired single-sheathed plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) and protected specimen brush (PSB) samples in 55 patients during 78 suspected episodes of nosocomial pneumonia. PTC and PSB samples were taken in randomized order, and patients were also randomized to have PTC samples taken \"blindly\" or via a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Fifteen PSB and 27 PTC samples were culture positive (greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml). The two sampling procedures gave similar results in 58 (74%) episodes. A major discrepancy occurred in 20 episodes, including six false negatives of PSB in episodes of proved pneumonia, four possible false positives of PSB, and 10 possible false positives of PTC (three of which rapidly evolved towards overt pneumonia). The sensitivity and specificity of PTC were 100 and 82.2%, and those of PSB were 64.7 and 93.5%, respectively. Blinded or directed PTC samples had similar concordance with PSB samples taken via bronchoscopy. We conclude that PTC is at least as accurate as PSB in the bacteriologic diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in intubated patients, and that its use can result in substantial cost savings, especially when fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not otherwise indicated.\r"

A significant increase (p less than 0.05) in C3a and C5a concentrations was demonstrated in lavage fluids from subjects who developed influenza illness as compared with uninfected control subjects and infected subjects who remained asymptomatic. Maximal levels of C3a and C5a were detected during the recovery phase of illness. These results suggest that complement is activated in the airway in response to influenza illness.\r"

Patients with P. carinii pneumonia and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were asked to participate in this study. All patients had P. carinii identified on methenamine silver stain of BAL fluid. BAL fluid was also stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa technique. The Wright-Giemsa stain was done to determine the cell differential count, and the number of P. carinii clusters associated with 500 nucleated cells was used as an estimate of P. carinii burden in the BAL. Initial and follow-up lavage was performed in 56 patients. Patients were classified based on their clinical response to anti-P. carinii therapy at 21 days. Nonresponders were patients with persistent or worsening symptoms. Responders were patients who improved and had therapy discontinued. Responders were further classified as responders with relapse if P. carinii pneumonia recurred within 6 months of the initial episode or responders without relapse if they remained disease free during the follow-up period. Responders without relapse reduced P. carinii cluster counts more than 50% in 24 of 25 cases. In responders with relapse P. carinii cluster counts were unchanged. The responders as a group had a significant decrease in the percentage of neutrophils in the BAL, with only 2 of 32 still having increased neutrophils in the follow-up lavage compared to 17 of 24 nonresponders (p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The factors responsible for the predisposition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients for PC infection are not fully understood. We postulated that changes in the alveolar lining material (ALM) could play a role in the pathogenesis of PC infection in AIDS. We have compared constituents of ALM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from normal, nonsmoking volunteers with that of HIV-infected patients with pneumonia. Using an ELISA, we found that surfactant protein A (SP-A) was markedly elevated in the pneumonia patients. Mean SP-A values for the normal nonsmoking individuals (n = 21) were 1.50 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SEM). SP-A levels in the HIV-infected patients (n = 22) were significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) with a mean of 5.23 +/- 0.54 micrograms/ml. This increase was greatest in the patients with more clinically severe pneumonia. The increase in SP-A did not appear to be pathogen-specific as it was also observed in cases of non-PC pneumonia. We also found that total protein levels were nearly five times higher in the HIV-infected pneumonia patients. These studies indicate that the protein component of the ALM is markedly different from normal in cases of HIV-associated PC and non-PC infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism of these alterations and their role, if any, in AIDS-related pneumonia.\r"

Therefore, we measured plasma TNF activity during sepsis and development of lung injury in a porcine model of ALI. Plasma samples were obtained from anesthetized saline-infused control pigs (n = 10) and those infused for 1 h with live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10(8) organisms/ml, 0.3 ml/20 kg/min) (n = 16). TNF activity was measured in plasma using the L929 fibroblast cytolytic assay. L929 cytotoxicity caused by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta was determined in plasma by measuring the cytotoxicity neutralized by TNF antisera. No significant TNF activity was detected in control pig plasma. In septic pigs, TNF activity appeared in plasma 15 min after onset of septicemia and remained elevated throughout the experiment (6.1 +/- 10.2% to 80.0 +/- 5.0%, 15 and 300 min, respectively). The appearance of pulmonary arterial hypertension, increased lung water, decreased lung compliance, and deteriorating gas exchange was correlated with the rise in plasma TNF activity, which reached a peak at 90 to 120 min in septic pigs. Our results provide evidence that both TNF subtypes are present in plasma during septicemia. Anti-TNF-alpha and anti-TNF-beta neutralized TNF activity in whole septic plasma at 15, 30, and 45 min after onset of septicemia, and the antibodies blocked TNF activity in serially diluted septic plasma at all time points up to 210 min of sepsis. TNF activity in septic plasma at 210 to 300 min was not neutralized entirely by TNF antisera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We hypothesized that PMN would be primed during their transit through injured tissue beds, which in turn can lead to modulation or retention of the primed PMN by downstream tissues like the lungs. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the transpulmonary gradient of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by zymosan-activated PMN. We examined the mixed venous to arterial difference in H2O2(delta H2O2) produced by zymosan-activated PMN in septic patients without lung infiltrates, patients with lung injury, and a control group of patients undergoing elective surgery or coronary catheterization. Septic patients had higher mixed venous H2O2/10(6) PMN, whereas lung injury patients had higher arterial H2O2/10(6) PMN. The control group had the same H2O2/10(6) PMN in mixed venous and arterial blood. The delta H2O2 in septic, lung injury, and control groups were 0.35 +/- 0.22, -0.31 +/- 0.48, and -0.01 +/- 0.04 nmol H2O2/10(6) PMN, respectively. The mixed venous to arterial H2O2 gradient distinguished septic patients from the control and lung injury patients (p less than 0.05). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that in septic patients PMN are primed in the periphery and downregulated or sequestered in the lung, and in lung injury patients PMN are primed in the lung and sequestered in the periphery. Alternatively, neutrophil-endothelial interactions may downregulate toxic O2 metabolite production by PMN during their transit through microvascular beds.\r"

We found that addition of AM to perfusates decreased lung weight gain in isolated rat lungs perfused with the H2O2-generating system of beta-D-glucose and glucose oxidase (G/GO) and that AM were as effective as the addition of erythrocytes or catalase in reducing injury. The ability of AM to protect isolated lungs corresponded with their ability to reduce H2O2 concentrations in vitro. By comparison, azide-treated AM had decreased catalase activity, did not prevent injury to lungs perfused with G/GO, and ineffectively decreased H2O2 in vitro. Mechanical disruption or stimulation of AM by phorbol myristate acetate or zymosan did not alter the AM H2O2-scavenging ability. We conclude that AM can scavenge H2O2 and limit oxidant-mediated injury.\r"

The monocytic phagocytes, that is, alveolar macrophages, were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 12 nonsmoking subjects; 10 subjects who smoked T only (TS); 13 subjects who smoked M only (MS); and 6 smokers of both T and M (MTS). The replication of these cells was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of dividing cells and visually counting 2,000 cells on autoradiographically prepared cytocentrifuge cell preparations. This study demonstrated that the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled monocytic phagocytes with characteristics of alveolar macrophages from either TS or MS have a higher proliferative index compared to cells (macrophages) from nonsmokers, p less than 0.05 by one-way ANOVA. The total number of BAL macrophages that are in mitosis in TS (17.90 +/- 4.50 labeled AM x 10(3)/ml) or MTS (10.50 +/- 4.20 labeled AM x 10(3)/ml) are 18- and 10-fold greater, respectively, than the number obtained from nonsmokers (1.01 +/- 0.18 labeled AM x 10(3)/ml). Interestingly, the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled macrophages from MS (2.90 +/- 0.66 labeled AM x 10(3)/ml) are also greater than the number obtained from nonsmokers, although this is not statistically significant. The stimulus augmenting alveolar macrophage replication is as yet unknown but may likely be found in the T or M smoke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 9 normal control subjects (Group A) and 60 sarcoidosis patients, 52 with an evolving disease (Group B) and 8 recovered (Group C), underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The second aliquot of fluid was used to measure urea, glucose, potassium, and albumin, which were also investigated in plasma. Urea was used to determine the volume of alveolar epithelial lining fluid (AELF volume). Results are expressed as the ratio of solute concentration in AELF over that in plasma (A/P ratio). In Group A there were clear concentration gradients of glucose, potassium, and albumin between the AELF and plasma, as the A/P ratios of glucose, potassium, and albumin were 0.02 +/- 0.006 (mean +/- SEM), 3.2 +/- 0.34, and 0.04 +/- 0.008, respectively.

The albumin but not the glucose A/P ratio was correlated with the percentage of lymphocytes recovered from BAL (p less than 0.02); however, there was no correlation between the albumin A/P ratio and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio. In group C there was a striking contrast between the albumin A/P ratio, which was normal, and the glucose A/P ratio, which was clearly elevated despite a normal lymphocyte count.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the hypotheses that amiodarone-induced pulmonary inflammation may be related to direct drug toxicity, groups of 10 or more Wistar rats were fed amiodarone by gavage at concentrations of 175, 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg/day, or vehicle alone. After 6 wk of drug feeding, the rats were examined for histologic and cellular evidence of pulmonary inflammation. In addition, the amounts of amiodarone, the major metabolite of amiodarone N-desethylamiodarone (N-des), and phospholipid in the lungs were determined. We found that rats fed 175 mg/kg of amiodarone were essentially no different from control animals. The 175 mg/kg group had normal lung histologies, no change in lavage cell counts or differential counts, and very little amiodarone, N-des, or phospholipid in the lungs. In contrast, the three high-dose groups had abnormal lung histologies along with increases in lavage cell counts and change in differential counts. There were also significant increases in the amounts of amiodarone, N-des, and phospholipid in the lung. We conclude that the development of amiodarone-induced pulmonary inflammation is dose dependent, and that there is a direct correlation between the amount of amiodarone, N-des, and phospholipid in the lung with the development of inflammation. It therefore appears that the drug is directly toxic to lung tissue.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the histopathologic pulmonary changes induced by mechanical pulmonary ventilation (MV) with a high peak airway pressure and a large tidal volume in healthy baby pigs. Eleven animals were mechanically ventilated at a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 40 cm H2O, a respiratory rate (RR) of 20 min-1, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 to 5 cm H2O, and an FIO2 of 0.4. High airway pressure MV was terminated in 22 +/- 11 h because of severe hypoxemia in the animals. Five of the baby pigs were killed for gross and light microscope studies. The pulmonary changes consisted of alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar neutrophil infiltration, alveolar macrophage and type II pneumocyte proliferation, interstitial congestion and thickening, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, emphysematous change, and hyaline membrane formation. Those lesions were similar to that seen in the early stage of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The remaining six animals were treated for 3 to 6 days with conventional respiratory care with appropriate ventilator settings. Prominent organized alveolar exudate in addition to lesions was also found in the five animals. These findings were indistinguishable from the clinical late stage of ARDS. Six control animals were mechanically ventilated at a PIP of less than 18 cm H2O, a RR of 20 min-1, a PEEP of 3 to 5 cm H2O, and an FIO2 of 0.4 for 48 h. They showed no notable changes in lung functions and histopathologic findings. Aggressive MV with a high PIP is often applied to patients with respiratory distress to attain adequate pulmonary gas exchange.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the means for early and accurate diagnosis of ventilator-associated (VA) pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients because of its high incidence and mortality. A good diagnostic yield has been reported from quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or a protected specimen brush, both obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. As bronchoscopy requires specific skills and is costly, we evaluated a simpler method to obtain BAL fluid, that is, by a catheter introduced blindly into the bronchial tree. Quantitative cultures from bronchoscopically sampled BAL (B-BAL) and blindly nonbronchoscopically collected BAL (NB-BAL) were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value for the diagnosis of VA pneumonia. A total of 40 pairs of samples were examined in 28 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and presenting a high risk of developing pneumonia. For comparison with bacteriologic data we defined a clinical score for pneumonia ranging from zero to 12 using the following variables: body temperature, leukocyte count, volume and character of tracheal secretions, arterial oxygenation, chest X-ray, Gram stain, and culture of tracheal aspirate. To quantify the bacteria in BAL the bacterial index (BI) was used, defined as the sum of the logarithm of the number of bacteria cultured per milliliter of BAL fluid. A good correlation between clinical score and quantitative bacteriology was observed (r = 0.84 for B-BAL and 0.76 for NB-BAL; p less than 0.0001). Similar to studies in baboons, patients with pulmonary infection could be distinguished by a BI greater than or equal to 5 with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% (B-BAL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are complex conditions with imprecise definitions, which make definitive morphologic comparisons difficult. Broadly, the airways in asthma are occluded by tenacious plugs of exudate and mucus, and there is fragility of airway surface epithelium, thickening of the reticular layer beneath the epithelial basal lamina, and bronchial vessel congestion and edema. There is increased inflammatory infiltrate comprising \"activated\" lymphocytes and eosinophils with release of granular content in the latter, and there is enlargement of bronchial smooth muscle, particularly in medium-sized bronchi. Three conditions contribute to COPD. In chronic bronchitis there is mucous hypersecretion with enlargement of tracheobronchial submucosal glands and a disproportionate increase of mucous acini. In small or peripheral airways disease, there is inflammation of bronchioli and mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia, with increased intraluminal mucus, increased wall muscle, fibrosis, and airway stenoses. Respiratory bronchiolitis is a critically important early lesion that may predispose to the development of centrilobular emphysema. The severity of emphysema, rather than type, appears to be the most important determinant of chronic deterioration of airflow, and in this there may be significant loss of elastic recoil prior to the observed morphologic destruction of the acinus.\r"

Circumstantial evidence exists implicating neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocytes in asthma pathogenesis based on increased numbers and activation of these cells in blood, BAL fluid, or biopsy material, and the propensity of these cells to release products causing tissue damage. There is increasing evidence that the accumulation and activation of these cells is orchestrated by lymphokines elaborated by sensitized T lymphocytes. In COPD, attention has been focused on the secretion of proteases by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, although there is no incontrovertible evidence that these are relevant to the disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients with normal serum concentrations of protease inhibitors. In the future, studies of the functions of inflammatory cells actually at the sites of inflammation using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and molecular biology may provide further information as to the role of these cells in the inflammatory processes associated with asthma and COPD.\r"

This would explain why there are no clear differences in the pharmacologic responsiveness of tissue from patients with asthma or COPD and those with no obstructive disease. Future in vitro studies should be directed towards reproducing the in vivo environment. this would entail the establishment of a chronic inflammatory condition created by the continuous presence of neural and humoral factors.\r"

Two factors might contribute to the different form and position of this curve: (1) mediator-induced airway muscle hypersensitivity and (2) thickening of the airway wall. We attempted to estimate the effect of a combination of these two factors on the increase in airway resistance of a single isolated human airway to increasing concentrations of MCh. The result suggests that mediator-induced hypersensitivity to cholinergic stimuli may explain a small part of the leftward shift of the asthmatic dose-response curve to MCh, especially at lower levels of bronchoconstriction, and that increased thickness of the airway wall may be more important for the increased slope and maximum of the asthmatic dose-response curve.\r"

Of these patients 32.8% had hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than or equal to 43 mm Hg). PaCO2 was directly related to lung resistance (RL; r = 0.53) and inversely related to FEV1 (r = 0.53) and to an expression of the dead space/tidal volume ratio (1 - VD/VT) (r = 0.48). RL was found to be a major determinant of the mean intrathoracic pressure swing developed during inspiration (PI) at rest (r = 0.85). Maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) was found to improve the predictive value for PaCO2 of several mechanical loads, with RL/PImax the best predictor (r = 0.57). The prevalence of hypercapnia increased from virtually 0 to 100% with increases in the RL/PImax value and was higher in the obese subjects at intermediate RL/PImax values, probably because of the burden placed on the respiratory muscles by chest wall mass loading. Our results show that chronic alveolar hypoventilation is likely to develop in COPD patients who have a combination of high inspiratory loads and inspiratory muscle weakness. hypercapnia may be one strategy available to avoid overloading of the inspiratory muscles leading to fatigue and possible irreversible failure.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports on the relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness (AH) with respiratory symptoms and diurnal peak flow expiratory (PEF) variation in 221 hyperresponsive patients with moderately severe airways obstruction. The disease was in a stable phase in all patients. Closely adhering to the American Thoracic Society criteria, patients were divided into three syndrome diagnoses based on a standardized history: asthma (n = 81), asthmatic bronchitis (AB, n = 69), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [( COPD] n = 44); 27 subjects could not be placed in any group. Mean (+/- SEM) log2 PC20 histamine values were significantly lower in the asthmatic group (-2.77 +/- 0.20 mg/ml) than in the COPD (-0.89 +/- 0.29 mg/ml) and AB groups (-1.37 +/- 0.25 mg/ml; one-way ANOVA, p less than 0.001). However, considerable overlap of individual responses existed. Differences between the groups could not be attributed to differences in prechallenge FEV1 levels. For every level of FEV1, asthmatic subjects were more hyperresponsive than patients with COPD. The dependence of PC20 on prechallenge FEV1 was comparable in all groups. There was a significant correlation between the degree of AH and diurnal PEF variation (rho = -0.401, p less than 0.001), which was stronger in asthma (rho = -0.409) than in COPD (rho = -0.325). Despite this obvious association, a wide range of diurnal PEF variation values existed for every level of PC20, indicating that PEF variability and AH are not interchangeable. The relationships between symptoms and both AH levels and PEF variation were weak. No significant differences were found between syndrome diagnosis groups with respect to diurnal PEF variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The three groups demonstrated a similar reduction in the FEV1. In addition, static and dynamic lung volumes, maximal expiratory flows, diffusing capacity for CO, airway resistance (Raw), and elastic lung recoil were measured. The observed alterations of Rrs and Xrs consisted of an increase in Rrs, a decrease in Rrs with frequency, and a decrease in Xrs. However, significant differences were found between the three groups: Rrs at 6 Hz and average Rrs were most increased in group A, whereas the negative frequency dependence of Rrs and the decrease in Xrs were least pronounced in group E. In all groups Rrs at 6 Hz, the average slope of Rrs, and the average level of Xrs were tightly interrelated and showed in addition a high correlation with airway resistance; the correlations with FEV1 were less satisfactory. Discriminant analysis performed on the complete set of data, excluding diffusing capacity and elastic lung recoil, which were used as selection criteria, demonstrated that forced oscillation parameters were the most important factors discriminating among the groups.\r"

  ".U": "91221400\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and presumed respiratory muscle fatigue may benefit from therapeutic maneuvers aimed at reducing the magnitude of inspiratory muscle effort. Recent work has demonstrated that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can significantly reduce inspiratory effort and work of breathing in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure. Accordingly it was reasoned that prolonged CPAP administration may similarly reduce the work of breathing in stable COPD patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, thereby allowing recovery from respiratory muscle fatigue. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of employing nasal CPAP during sleep as a means of implementing this approach to reducing inspiratory muscle effort in such patients. Standard polysomnographic parameters were recorded during nocturnal administration of nasal CPAP in eight stable patients with severe COPD (FEV1 = 26.7 +/- 3.9% of predicted). Esophageal pressure, diaphragmatic (EMGdi) and parasternal intercostal (EMGic) electromyographic activity, arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2), and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) were also measured. Breathing pattern was determined by respiratory inductive plethysmography. In each patient an optimum level of nasal CPAP could be determined that produced consistent reductions in indices of inspiratory muscle effort without changing tidal volume or breathing frequency. Highly significant reductions in the tidal excursions of esophageal pressure and the pressure-time integral for the inspiratory muscles occurred at the optimum CPAP level in all patients. EMGdi and EMGic were similarly reduced. SaO2 and PtcCO2 were unaffected by CPAP. These results indicate that nasal CPAP can effectively reduce inspiratory muscle effort during sleep in patients with severe COPD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have described compliance with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) only in terms of the number of patients able to use it beyond their initial trial night or those continuing after some home use. Because of a possible difference between the level of compliance (mean number of hours of use per 24 h) needed for symptomatic relief of OSA versus cardiovascular improvement, the level of hourly compliance in chronic nCPAP users may be important. The first part of this study prospectively examines compliance in a stable population of OSA patients already using nCPAP for 6 months to 2 yr. The second part is a prospective randomized, crossover study examining the effect of weekly (three times) then monthly (twice) positive reinforcement on hourly compliance of new nCPAP users for 3 months versus no reinforcement for 3 months. Positive reinforcement consisted of telephone discussions with the patients about the severity or complications of OSA, benefits of nCPAP, and suggestions about minimizing side effects. Using self-assessment scales, each patient reported the perceived level of improvement from the untreated to the treated condition and the prevalence and severity of side effects from the nCPAP therapy. The level of compliance in stable, chronic nCPAP users with OSA was 6.1 +/- 2.2 h/24 h (n = 9). For the new nCPAP users during the nonreinforced period, the mean compliance was 6.0 +/- 2.8 h/24 h; that during the reinforcement period was 6.0 +/- 2.7 h/24 h (NS). There was no significant correlation between perceived improvement in OSA symptoms or between the perceived side effects of nCPAP versus hourly compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that those obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with upper airway collapse during sleep within the transpalatal airway would have a more favorable response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPP) than those patients with obstruction within the hypopharyngeal airway. We tested this hypothesis in seven OSA patients with transpalatal and seven with hypopharyngeal obstruction undergoing UPP. Preoperatively the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was different between palatal and hypopharyngeal obstructors, 37.8 +/- 6.0 (+/- SEM) and 63.9 +/- 6.3, respectively (p less than 0.05), but the apnea-associated arterial oxygen desaturation and the lowest sleep saturation level were not different between the two groups. Postoperatively the AHI was 17.6 +/- 7.2 in the palatal obstructors and 40.3 +/- 15.6 in the hypopharyngeal obstructors (both p less than 0.05 from preoperative AHI). The palatal obstructors had a significant decrease in the percentage of sleep time spent apneic and the hypopharyngeal obstructors had a significant decrease in the hypopnea, but not apnea, time following surgery. The palatal obstructors had a significantly higher postoperative arterial oxygen saturation than the hypopharyngeal obstructors. Two hypopharyngeal obstructors worsened postoperatively. In addition we found that regardless of the site of the obstruction preoperatively, all obstructions occurred at the level of the palate postoperatively. We conclude that patients with preoperative transpalatal obstruction had diminution in obstructive apneas and those with hypopharyngeal obstruction had diminution in hypopneas but not apneas. Oxygenation was better postoperatively in the palatal obstructors, and none worsened postoperatively. These results suggest that identification of the site of upper airway obstruction in OSA may be beneficial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

N and D sleep studies were performed in random order at a minimal interval of 36 h. No treatment (drug, CPAP) was initiated between the two studies. Both studies included the recording of sleep stages (EEG, EOG, EMG), nasal and mouth flows, thoracoabdominal movements, electrocardiogram, and SaO2 (ear oximetry).

As expected, the total sleep time (TST) was significantly shorter during the D than during the N study (2.6 +/- 0.2 and 6.2 +/- 0.2 h, respectively, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test).

The ratio Pnp/Pes MRR was 1.20 +/- 0.2 in COPD, 1.14 +/- 0.12 in IPF, and 1.07 +/- 0.13 in SLE. We confirm that the transmission of pleural pressure to the upper airways during brief dynamic maneuvers is impaired in the presence of airway obstruction and lung fibrosis.

Hamster diaphragm strips were studied in Krebs solution aerated with 21% O2 and 12% CO2. The force-frequency responses and the tension and relaxation of brief, submaximal contractions were studied. Mild fatigue was produced by a series of 45 submaximal contractions, after which recovery of force was followed for 15 min. Theophylline (0.55 mM) was added at the time of exposure to HHA (early theophylline) in half the strips and at the end of the fatigue run (late theophylline) in the others. In contrast to our hypothesis, early theophylline had a limited effect on force production in unfatigued HHA diaphragm strips and resulted in lower force production in the recovery period. Late theophylline improved force in the recovery period for low-frequency contractions. Thus the effect of theophylline in the setting of HHA depended on the time it was added and was beneficial only if added after the muscle stopped contracting.\r"

More specifically, we assessed if expiratory airflow limits were achieved and how this may modulate the regulation of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). We found that with only mild to moderate (50 to 75% VO2max) exercise, the mean EELV was reduced 0.38 +/- 0.07 L, and that expiratory flow limitation was present over 25 +/- 4% of the VT. In 11 subjects during this intensity of exercise, EELV was within their closing capacity. As exercise intensity progressed, VT plateaued at 58 +/- 2% of the vital capacity, and increased expiratory air flow rates were achieved by significantly increasing the EELV back to near resting levels, thereby moving a portion of the expiratory tidal flow-volume envelope away from the constraints of the effort independent portion of the maximal flow-volume curve. During heavy exercise, end-inspiratory lung volume (EILV) approached 90% of TLC. To achieve greater expiratory flow with maximal exercise, EELV remained similar to the previous intensity, and a significantly greater portion of the tidal expiratory flow-volume envelope (greater than 40% of the VT) became flow-limited. Despite this significant expiratory limitation, a rise in EELV, and an EILV approaching TLC, TI/Ttot remained constant throughout exercise, and the ventilatory response for the metabolic demand (VA/VCO2) was appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured the optimal transpulmonary pressures for maximal expiratory airflow and the capacity of the muscles of inspiration for developing pleural pressure (taking into account the effects of lung volume and flow rate). Within these mechanical constraints to ventilation we plotted tidal pleural pressure-volume loops for mild through maximal exercise according to a measured end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). We found EELV to decrease a mean of 0.26 +/- 0.09 L and maximal effective pleural pressures to be reached in nine subjects near EELV with only light to moderate exercise intensities, whereas peak inspiratory pressure was only 45% of the capacity for pressure generation. With progressive increases in exercise intensity, EELV increased, and pleural pressures encroached to a greater extent on the maximal effective pressures; however, they remained effective in the majority of subjects. During maximal exercise EELV was 0.13 +/- 0.10 L greater than resting values, 20% of the Vt reached maximal effective pressures, and 83% of the capacity for inspiratory pressure was achieved. Three subjects significantly surpassed their maximal effective expiratory pressures, and four subjects achieved 95 to 100% of the capacity for inspiratory pressure generation. These subjects also showed no further increase in ventilation while breathing 0.02 to 0.05 FICO2 at maximal exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Methacholine airway responsiveness was analyzed as both a continuous (dose-response slope) and categorical (PD20 FEV1 greater than 8.6 mumol; PD20 FEV1 less than or equal to 8.6 mumol) variable. Methacholine responsiveness, as assessed by dose-response slope, displayed a significant inverse relationship to the prechallenge level of FEV1 (p less than 0.001). The dose-response slope was directly related to age among former smokers (p = 0.003) but not among current and never smokers. Using a categorical variable rather than the dose-response slope to characterize responder status yielded very similar results. A logistic regression model of the data predicts an approximately threefold greater odds of a positive methacholine challenge test in association with a 500 ml lower FEV1. The model predicts that among former smokers a 20-yr increase in age is associated with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of a positive methacholine challenge test. This analysis suggests that nonspecific airway responsiveness increases with advancing age among former smokers even after adjustment for prechallenge level of FEV1.\r"

The study included 933 schoolchildren from the fourth and fifth grades. The protocol included the standardized 1978 American Thoracic Society (ATS) questionnaire for children, skin testing using common aero-allergens and controls, and antigenic measurements of dust samples from mattresses (Group I antigen). The prevalence of asthma with positive skin test to HDM and the overall prevalence of positive skin test to HDM were significantly lower in mountain schoolchildren. The mean geometric HDM antigenic level in mattresses was much lower in the Alps (0.36 micrograms/g dust) than at sea level (15.8 micrograms/g dust). In contrast, the prevalence of hay fever and positive skin test to grass pollens as well as the overall prevalence of positive skin tests to grass pollens were significantly higher in the Alps.

In the present report, we reexamine this relationship, after taking into account asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and positive skin prick tests, using data collected in 1985 in a subsample of 363 men from the initial population. Blood eosinophilia, defined by 5% or more eosinophils or by 250 or more eosinophils per cubic millimeter appeared to be associated with a lower FEV1, primarily in nonsmokers. A difference of approximately 0.40 L was observed in never-smokers with eosinophilia (greater than or equal to 5% of eosinophils) compared with those without. This association persisted after exclusion of subjects with atopy, asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Longitudinally, no significant association was observed between 1980 eosinophilia and the annual FEV1 decline between 1980 and 1985, even in nonsmokers. The results of our cross-sectional analyses suggest that asthma or asthma-like disorder does not explain the association between eosinophilia and FEV1. The role of eosinophil in respiratory disorders may go beyond its intervention in allergy. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand discrepancies between cross-sectional and longitudinal data and whether eosinophilia is a risk factor for chronic air-flow limitation.\r"

We proposed that if MC plays a significant role in acute illness, MC should be impaired during the exacerbation but improve after recovery. To test this hypothesis, five asthmatic patients with attacks requiring hospitalization underwent measurement of MC using radiolabeled aerosol and a gamma camera. They were studied on the second or third day after admission with repeat measurements after discharge. Spirometry was performed before all studies. After an equilibrium xenon scan (133Xe), which defined lung borders and measured regional volume, radiolabeled saline particles containing technetium-labeled (99mTC) sulfur colloid were deposited and used to label airway mucus. Deposition patterns were matched by regulating particle distribution and breathing pattern. MC was then measured as percentage retention of radioactivity at 10-min intervals for 2 h. When hospitalized, 96.0 +/- 2.06% (SEM) of the initial radioactivity was retained in the lung after 2 h, indicating little clearance of mucus from the lung. In fact, no significant changes were detected when activity at 120 min was compared with measurements at 10 min (99.2 +/- 0.22%, NS). After discharge clearance was markedly enhanced. That is, retention of lung activity was significantly lower at all time intervals from 10 min onward, with only 70.9 +/- 3.86% retained at 120 min (p = 0.008). During an asthmatic attack warranting hospital admission, MC is significantly impaired, with marked improvement following recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the magnitude and duration of the effect of inhalation of formoterol (12 and 24 micrograms), albuterol (200 micrograms), and placebo in terms of protection against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. The 16 stable adult asthmatic subjects were studied on four separate study days. On each study day the subjects inhaled 2 puffs of the study medication, and methacholine tests were performed at 30 min and 4, 8, and 12 h later. Results were expressed as the provocative concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). At 30 min, 12 and 24 micrograms formoterol caused a mean 14- to 20-fold decrease in responsiveness, and albuterol a 12-fold decrease. However, albuterol had no significant protective effect at 4 h or thereafter, whereas there was still an 8-fold decrease in responsiveness for 24 micrograms formoterol and a 6-fold decrease for 12 micrograms formoterol at 12 h. This study has shown that both doses of formoterol were still actively protective against induced bronchoconstriction 12 h after inhalation, with minimal side effects. This suggests that formoterol may prove to be a very useful bronchodilator for the treatment of patients with asthma who have significant airway hyperresponsiveness or nocturnal symptoms and who require inhaled beta 2-agonists at least twice daily.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the independent contributions of bone mass and existing fractures as predictors of the risk for new vertebral fractures. SUBJECTS: Postmenopausal Japanese-American women. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline measurements of the distal radius, the proximal radius, and the calcaneus were obtained in 1981 using single-photon absorptiometry. Measurements of the lumbar spine were obtained in 1984 using dual-photon absorptiometry. Prevalent vertebral fractures were identified using dimensions measured on lateral radiographs; vertebral height values more than 3 SD below vertebra-specific means were considered to indicate fracture. Statistical models were used to evaluate the utility of bone mass and existing (prevalent) fractures to predict the risk for new fractures during an average follow-up of 4.7 years. MAIN RESULTS: Differences of 2 SD in bone mass were associated with fourfold to sixfold increases in the risk for new vertebral fractures. A single fracture at the baseline examination increased the risk for new vertebral fractures fivefold. Presence of two or more fractures at baseline increased the risk 12-fold. A combination of low bone mass (below the 33d percentile) and the presence of two or more prevalent fractures increased the risk 75-fold, relative to women with the highest bone mass (above the 67th percentile) and no prevalent fractures. Stature, body mass index, arm span, and spinal conditions such as scoliosis, osteoarthritis, and sacroiliitis did not predict fracture incidence (P greater than 0.05). Weight was marginally predictive (P = 0.04) of fracture incidence but became nonpredictive after adjusting for bone mass (P greater than or equal to 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both bone mass and prevalent vertebral fractures are powerful predictors of the risk for new vertebral fractures. Combining information about bone mass and prevalent fracture appears to be better for predicting new fractures than either variable alone. Physicians can use these risk factors to identify patients at greatest risk for new fractures.\r"

PATIENTS: Eighty-six patients enrolled in a trial of plasmapheresis for severe diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-six of the patients received high-dose steroid therapy plus cyclophosphamide therapy for 8 weeks. Thereafter, cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued, and steroid therapy was tapered (standard treatment group). Forty patients received identical treatment and had 12 plasmapheresis procedures during the first 4 weeks of the treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were examined for the development of infection. MAIN RESULTS: No statistical difference in age, sex, race, serum creatinine level, proteinuria, or complement levels was found between the two groups. Over a follow-up period of 5376 patient-weeks, 74% of patients in the standard treatment group had 62 infections, yielding an aggregate infection rate of 1.15 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 1.08; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.44). This rate was comparable to that seen in the plasmapheresis-treated patients who were followed for 4187 patient-weeks: 68% had 51 infections, for an aggregate infection rate of 1.22 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 0.94; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.32). The infection rate was also comparable in the initial acute phase of the study, despite the fact that patients who received plasmapheresis then had significantly lower immunoglobulin (IgG) levels (P less than 0.001). Neither the site (superficial compared with systemic) nor the nature (conventional compared with unconventional) of infection differed statistically between the two groups. Of 14 patient deaths, 7 were from infection (4 in control group and 3 in the plasmapheresis group). CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis did not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis.\r"

DESIGN: Clinical experimental study. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 14 welders recruited through public advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Participants welded galvanized steel. MEASUREMENTS: We measured lung volumes, airflow, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and airway reactivity at baseline as well as either 6 or 20 hours after welding. We carried out bronchoalveolar lavage either 8 hours (early follow-up, 5 participants) or 22 hours (late follow-up, 9 participants) after welding, assaying the fluid for total and differential cell counts and bronchoalveolar lavage supernatant concentrations of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). MAIN RESULTS: Changes in pulmonary function and airway reactivity were minimal. Cumulative zinc exposure and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at late (r = 0.87; P less than 0.01) and early (r = 0.93; P less than 0.05) follow-up were positively correlated. Among the late follow-up group, the mean proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was 37% (range, 19% to 63%), a statistically greater proportion than the 9% (range, 2% to 21%) seen among the early follow-up group (P less than 0.05). We did not detect TNF or more than a trace amount of interleukin-1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc oxide welding fume was associated with a marked dose-dependent increase in the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 22 hours after exposure but was not associated with a clinically significant change in pulmonary function or airway reactivity. Although we did not identify increases in either interleukin-1 or TNF levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cytokines or a cytokine-like mechanism may mediate the syndrome of metal fume fever.\r"

DESIGN: Dose escalation, drug interaction study. SETTING: University clinical research center. PATIENTS: Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex. INTERVENTIONS: Acetaminophen and 200 mg of zidovudine simultaneously every 4 hours. For 13 patients, the unit dosage of acetaminophen was 325 mg for 3 days; for 8 patients, the dosage was 650 mg for 3 days; and, for 6 patients, the dosage was 650 mg for 7 days. MEASUREMENTS: Zidovudine clearance and production of the glucuronide conjugate of zidovudine were assessed after acetaminophen treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Neither zidovudine clearance nor production of the glucuronide conjugate of zidovudine was impaired after treatment with acetaminophen. Clearance of zidovudine was actually accelerated by 5%, 11%, and 33% with the three acetaminophen regimens, respectively (P = 0.002 by analysis of variance; P = 0.04 for linear trend when changes in the area-under-the-curve for zidovudine were compared). CONCLUSION: Because serum concentrations of zidovudine decrease after the coadministration of acetaminophen, a pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine and acetaminophen is unlikely to increase the risk for hematologic toxicity associated with zidovudine.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient facilities of the New York University Medical Center/Bellevue Hospital and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. PATIENTS: Case patients were 22 patients hospitalized with disease exacerbation and no evidence of parenchymal lung disease on chest roentgenogram. Four patients with stable disease were followed in the outpatient clinic, and five healthy normal volunteers served as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels of complement split products (C3a, factor Bb fragment), alveolar-arterial (A-a) Po2 gradients, and pulmonary function were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Nine episodes of hypoxemia or hypocapnia (mean A-a gradient, 30.4 +/- 4.8 mm Hg) or both (despite normal chest roentgenogram results) were noted in six hospitalized patients (group 1). Gas exchange improved within 72 hours of steroid therapy (mean A-a gradient, 11.6 +/- 4.3 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). These patients had an elevated initial mean C3a level (938.4 +/- 246.8 ng/mL) that decreased within 72 hours (407.8 +/- 80.9 ng/mL; P less than 0.01), concomitant with improved oxygenation. Ventilation-perfusion scans, obtained for four of six group 1 patients, excluded pulmonary emboli. Four hospitalized patients (group 2) had a normal A-a gradient (mean, 7.5 +/- 2.7 mm Hg). The mean C3a level of this group (358.3 +/- 39.2 ng/mL) was lower than that of group 1 (P less than 0.05). Four patients with stable disease (group 3) had a mean A-a gradient and a mean C3a level of 3.3 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and 237.8 +/- 105.7 ng/mL, respectively, similar to values found in five normal volunteers, in whom the mean A-a gradient was 3.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg and the mean C3a level was 124.8 +/- 9.2 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: A syndrome of reversible hypoxemia, unassociated with parenchymal lung disease, is unexpectedly common in acutely ill, hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unclear, although the data are compatible with the hypothesis that hypoxemia may be related to pulmonary leukoaggregation.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: Patients recovering from a first confirmed episode of AIDS-related P. carinii pneumonia who had no evidence of either another active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or another pulmonary abnormality were considered eligible for the study but were included only if they had received no immunomodulators or antiretroviral agents other than zidovudine within 30 days of entry. One hundred sixty-two patients were randomized and started on the study drug. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive aerosol pentamidine, 60 mg per dose, or placebo, delivered using a hand-held, patient-triggered, ultrasonic nebulizer. The induction phase of treatment consisted of 5 doses over 14 days, followed by a maintenance phase beginning on day 21 and consisting of one dose every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases of P. carinii pneumonia were diagnosed before the termination of the trial; 27 cases occurred among 78 patients receiving placebo and 5 occurred among 84 patients receiving aerosol pentamidine. Estimates of the cumulative relapse rate of P. carinii pneumonia by 24 weeks were 50% and 9% for the placebo and pentamidine groups, respectively (P less than 0.001). Adverse reactions attributed to the study drug occurred in 15 of 78 patients receiving placebo and in 28 of 84 patients receiving pentamidine (P = 0.04). These were all mild or moderate in severity and did not preclude continued administration of the study drug. CONCLUSION: Intermittent therapy with aerosol pentamidine is highly effective and well tolerated as secondary prophylaxis for AIDS-related P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To examine the evidence for a relation between advancing patient age and the risk for adverse drug reactions. DATA SOURCE: A computer-assisted search of the English-language literature (MEDLINE, 1966 to 1990) followed by selective review of all pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that stratified data on adverse drug reactions by patient age were screened for review. Article selection was not limited by study design; the relation between age and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions did not have to be a primary focus of the study. DATA EXTRACTION: Pertinent data were abstracted from the results of case-control and cohort studies and from clinical trials. The methodologic strengths and weaknesses of these studies are discussed with particular reference to gerontologic issues. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Most studies have neglected the issue of whether the increased frequency of adverse drug reactions in the elderly is attributable to age alone or to the fact that older patients are more likely to have coexisting illnesses and to be taking several medications. Studies that combine all drug exposures for each patient and report the risk for any adverse effect provide little useful information about the risks associated with specific drug therapies in the elderly. The association between age and the risk for adverse drug reactions is best examined for individual pharmacologic agents. However, the exclusion of elderly subjects from clinical trials makes the determination of age effects impossible in many studies. Where subjects do represent an adequate age range, most studies fail to control for important clinical differences among subjects of different ages to distinguish the independent effects of chronologic age. CONCLUSION: Conventional clinical wisdom suggests that the risk for adverse drug reactions increases with advancing age, but available data do not confirm this \"truism\" of geriatric medicine. The inter-individual variability of the aging process, including the non-uniform nature of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that occur with aging, indicates that clinical reality is far more complex. Patient-specific physiologic and functional characteristics are probably more important than any chronologic measure in predicting both adverse and beneficial outcomes associated with specific drug therapies.\r"

In this conference, we attempt to re-evaluate the data on the relation between alcohol intake and coronary heart disease, emphasizing the effects of alcohol on lipoprotein metabolism. Epidemiologic data generally show an inverse correlation between coronary heart disease risk and moderate alcohol intake (variously defined but generally corresponding to 2 to 4 drinks per day). The potentially drastic effects of excessive alcohol intake on health, however, preclude any recommendation that patients increase their alcohol consumption. Equally, there may be no basis for prescribing moderate alcohol intake but, even here, the data are far from complete. The mechanism by which moderate alcohol intake \"protects\" remains unclear. Perhaps the best available hypothesis relates to the increased concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol associated with moderate alcohol intake. However, it should be stressed that we are still uncertain about the mechanisms linking a high HDL level to protection against coronary heart disease. If a high HDL level is only a marker (and not directly protective), raising HDL levels need not confer protection. Alcoholism, on the other hand, is associated with marked elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is among the most common causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Moreover, once hepatic damage occurs, plasma HDL levels may actually be lower than normal. The determining point is that high alcohol intakes are associated with increased overall mortality. Until we know more about the metabolic and behavioral effects of alcohol and about its linkage to atherosclerosis, we have no basis for recommending either that patients increase their alcohol intake or that they start to drink if they do not already.\r"

Mild to severe endolymphatic hydrops was sometimes observed. The study shows diffusion of drugs taking place against the longitudinal flow of endolymph.

Ninety-six percent of the patients had incision and drainage of their abscesses; 8 patients required more than one incision and drainage. Two patients required airway intervention, 1 by intubation and 1 by trachetomy. Most pediatric cervical abscesses respond well to appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage.\r"

Cilia reappeared after 1 week. The number of ciliated cells increased progressively and within 1 month large areas of the aggregates were ciliated. These newly formed cilia were ultrastructurally normal. The ciliary activity as well coordinated and resulted in continuous movements of the aggregates in the culture medium. In the supranuclear cytoplasm the different ciliogenetic precursors were found: fibrogranular aggregates with occasionally small tubules, deuterosomes with procentrioles, kinetosomes, basal bodies, and short cilia. Initial stages of ciliary shaft formation, such as elevation of the apical membrane above the basal bodies without axonemal ultrastructure, could be well documented. The results indicate that in cystic fibrosis, ciliogenesis and the resulting ciliary activity in vitro are indistinguishable from those seen in cells from control tissue.\r"

In contrast to the superficial epithelium, which showed a fairly constant keratin composition consisting of the neutral-to-basic keratins K4, K5, K6, and K8 and the acidic keratins K13, K14, K16, and K19, the keratin profiles of tonsillar crypt epithelial cells were found to be more variable, particularly with respect to the expression levels of K4 and K13. These were identical to those of surface epithelium, reduced, or abolished. Since K4 and K13 characterize the mature stage of differentiation in squamous nonkeratinizing epithelia, their decrease is indicative of an incomplete epithelial differentiation. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed this hypothesis and allowed us, furthermore, to correlate the expression of K13 with the morphologic alterations of tonsillar crypt epithelium in the course of reticulation.\r"

Premedication with morphine and atropine and local anesthesia with lidocaine hydrochloride significantly decreased the CBF. Among the control subjects, a significantly higher CBF (13.6 +/- 1.5 Hz) was found in the young age group (10 to 19 years) as compared to other groups (12.2 +/- 1.7 Hz). Gender and ethnic origin did not influence CBF in any age group. These data support the possible use of the in vitro study of nasal epithelium to reflect the CBF in the lower respiratory tract.\r"

Large-diameter, M-type vestibular nerve fibers terminate in a calyx at the heminode, and labeling is coextensive with the base of the calyx. Intermediate, M/U-type nerve fibers have short, unmyelinated preterminal segments that sometimes bifurcate intramacularly, and small-diameter, U-type nerve fibers have long, unmyelinated preterminal axons and up to three branches. Preterminals of these nerve fibers display ultrastructural heterogeneity that is correlated with labeling patterns for sodium channels and/or associated polyanionic sites. They have a nodelike ultrastructure and label heavily from near the heminode to the base of the macula. Their intramacular branches, less organized ultrastructurally, label only slightly. Results indicate that vestibular nerve fibers have one impulse initiation zone, located near the heminode, that varies in length according to nerve fiber type. Structural heterogeneity may favor impulse conduction in the central direction, and length of the impulse initiation zone could influence nerve discharge patterns.\r"

The aim was to better understand the role of mast cells in the middle ear defense mechanism. The density of mast cells was highest in the pharyngeal orifice of the eustachian tube, and decreased in the direction of the tympanic orifice. The density was higher in adults than in developing animals. Mast cells were also found in the tubotympanic membrane of the fetal guinea pig. Mast cells in the middle ear mucosa appeared in areas covered by ciliated epithelia or areas richly vascularized. Almost all mast cells found in the middle ear and eustachian tube mucosa were the connective tissue type. The results of this investigation suggest that mast cells distribute in the tubotympanum in response to continuous stimuli to the tubotympanic cavity.\r"

The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser was used for tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for all obstructing endobronchial neoplasms. Indications for therapy included severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonitis. All patients had relatively central lesions. A rigid bronchoscope was used to treat 88% of patients, and 12% of patients were treated with a flexible bronchoscope. One death occurred during the intraoperative period. Eleven deaths occurred within 1 week of therapy and were related to the presence of extensive malignant lesions or to coronary artery disease. Our experience indicates that bronchoscopic application of the CO2 or Nd:YAG laser affords effective palliation for patients with obstructive tracheobronchial lesions. The Nd:YAG laser is recommended for patients with bulky vascular endobronchial neoplasms, and the CO2 laser is best reserved for patients with benign tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue.\r"

Tissue-invasive and angioinvasive aspergillosis can be a rapidly lethal disease, particularly in the immune-compromised host. The allergic form of paranasal sinus aspergillosis is presumed to be initiated by hyperreactivity to fungal antigens. Not all allergic fungal sinusitis is associated with Aspergillus species, and culture confirmation is necessary to distinguish the fungal agent. Surgical removal of the offending fungus is the mainstay of therapy in all forms of sinonasal aspergillosis and other fungal sinusitis. Antifungal agents and steroids complement surgical removal, depending on the form of the sinusitis.\r"

The median CSF bactericidal titers were 1:128 against both organisms at 1 h of uninfected animals, the mean penetration was 4.5%. There was a significant reduction in the concentrations of bacteria in CSFs of both groups of animals treated with cefpirome compared with that in untreated groups. Mortality was also significantly lower in treated animals than it was in untreated animals.

  ".W": "Most bacteria at an infection site obtain energy by the breakdown of glucose via microaerophilic or anaerobic pathways and in the process yield various end products. In this study, production of D-lactic acid by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was correlated with glucose utilization by bacteria during exposure to antibiotics at subinhibitory, inhibitory, and suprainhibitory concentrations. D-Lactic acid production was further correlated with production of a tissue-destroying enzyme, hyaluronidase, by S. aureus. For E. coli, all agents tested showed dose-related bacterial killing, with the most noticeable being with ampicillin, piperacillin, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol had the most dose-related effects on D-lactic acid production. With few exceptions, hyaluronidase production correlated well with D-lactic acid production in S. aureus. Subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin and clindamycin effectively decreased accumulation of D-lactic acid and hyaluronidase. Determination of D-lactic acid production may perhaps serve as a means of independently monitoring the effects of antimicrobial agents on bacterial metabolic activity, which is an important aspect of antimicrobial action that remains relatively unexplored.\r"

  ".W": "The ROB-1 beta-lactamase-encoding plasmids from eight Pasteurella and two Haemophilus strains were compared by restriction endonuclease and hybridization analyses. Two types of ROB-1-encoding plasmids, which differed in size, were detected. One (4.1 kb) was found only in Pasteurella strains. The other (4.4 kb) was found in both Haemophilus influenzae and in one of the eight Pasteurella strains examined. These two plasmids shared multiple homologous fragments, suggesting that one was derived from the other. The ROB-1-encoding gene from Pasteurella haemolytica LNPB 51 was cloned and sequenced. An open reading frame of 915 nucleotides was found; it encoded a 305-amino-acid protein. Analysis of this amino acid sequence confirmed that the enzyme was found; it encoded a 305-amino-acid protein. Analysis of this amino acid sequence confirmed that the enzyme is a class A beta-lactamase. It had 32 to 48% homology with other class A enzymes and exhibited several common features of the gram-positive beta-lactamases. The ROB-1 mature protein, however, contained only one cysteine residue at position 123. These results suggest that ROB-1 is a link between beta-lactamases of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. An internal 230-bp DraI fragment from ROB-1 hybridized only with plasmid DNA from ROB-1-producing strains. This specific probe could be useful in epidemiological studies.\r"

For in vitro studies, a sensitive immunoassay was used for assessment of Toxoplasma growth in tissue cultures; dapsone was found to have a significant inhibitory effect at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml in the cultures, and the 50% inhibitory concentration was estimated to be 0.55 micrograms/ml. When pyrimethamine and dapsone were combined, an important synergistic effect which was associated with morphological alterations of the parasites was observed. In vivo studies were performed in a murine model of acute toxoplasmosis in which a tissue culture method was used to estimate the parasite burden in the blood, lungs, and brains of infected mice. Dapsone alone, which was administered at 100 mg/kg/day for 10 days from day 1 after infection, was unable to prevent parasite dissemination and only delayed the time to death of treated mice compared with the time of death of untreated controls. When dapsone and pyrimethamine (18.5 mg/kg/day) were administered in combination from day 4 after infection, parasites were cleared from blood and organs within 6 days, but relapses were observed 15 days after the cessation of therapy. When treatment was started at day 1 after infection, 100% of mice survived and relapses were not observed, suggesting a good efficacy of this combination for preventive therapy.\r"

It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.\r"

The uptake of p-aminobenzoic acid was not inhibited by the sulfa drugs. However, infected erythrocytes took up more labeled sulfamethoxazole than did uninfected erythrocytes. Thus, the concentration of sulfa drugs by malaria parasites may explain how sulfa drugs inhibit in vitro growth of parasites through the inhibition of dihydropteroate synthetase.\r"

The drug was administered orally in the milk replacer over a period of 3 to 14 days at doses ranging from 30 to 500 micrograms/kg of body weight. Over a period of 4 weeks, the animals were examined twice a week for shedding of C. parvum oocysts and were scored semiquantitatively for diarrhea. Weight gain was assessed after 2 and 4 weeks. Subclinical infections by rota-, corona-, and bovine picobirnaviruses were equally distributed in the different groups. In total, 93% of the unmedicated calves eliminated C. parvum within 10 days after arrival at the rearing unit and 62% of them showed diarrhea. Immediately after treatment with halofuginone was started, no more signs of Cryptosporidium-associated diarrhea were established. From the level of 60 micrograms/kg on, oocysts were no longer detected in 98% of animals 5 to 6 days after the start of treatment. Animals remained negative for at least 7 days after withdrawal of the drug. From 7 to 10 days after withdrawal, some animals excreted oocysts again. The number of shedders was closely linked with increasing doses of the drug, which indicates that lower doses do not interrupt infection completely and allow development of immunity. In this respect, a dose of 60 to 125 micrograms/kg over a period of 7 days seems most appropriate in practice. Toxic side effects were noticed only at 500 micrograms/kg.\r"

After 17 days of therapy, fluconazole decreased the fungal colony counts of the choroid-retinas significantly more than did the saline control (P less than 0.05); however, after 24 days of fluconazole therapy, this treatment effect was lost and fluconazole was no more effective than saline. In contrast, treatment for 24 days with amphotericin B reduced the vitreous and choroid-retina fungal colony counts significantly more than either fluconazole or saline (P less than 0.05 for both treatment groups). After 17 days of therapy, indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed less severe eye involvement in both antifungal treatment groups than in saline controls; however, this difference reached statistical significance only for the amphotericin B-treated rabbits (P less than 0.05). Also, there was a trend towards worsening eye lesions, as seen by indirect ophthalmoscopy, in the fluconazole-treated rabbits after 24 days of therapy, which roughly paralleled the quantitative culture results. Despite the presence of negative choroid-retina cultures, some rabbits in all treatment groups had persistently visible eye lesions, indicating that ophthalmoscopic resolution of Candida endophthalmitis may lag behind lesion sterilization. Amphotericin B was superior to fluconazole in the treatment of Candida endophthalmitis in this model.\r"

Replication within human foreskin fibroblasts of tachyzoites of seven different strains, five of them isolated from AIDS patients, was inhibited by concentrations as low as 4.8 x 10(-9) M. In vivo, a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, administered by gavage for 10 days, protected 100% of mice against death due to infection with five different strains of T. gondii, including the highly virulent RH strain. A dose of 50 mg/kg/day protected at least 80% of mice infected with the same inoculum, and a dose as low as 9.3 mg/kg/day protected 40 to 60% of mice. Treatment with 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days completely eradicated parasites from mice infected with four of five strains of T. gondii. 566C80 was active in vitro against the cyst stage of T. gondii at concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms/ml. In vivo activity against this form of T. gondii was examined in mice infected for 6 weeks with strain ME49 and then treated orally with 100 mg of 566C80 per kg per day for 8 weeks. Treated mice sacrificed at 2-week intervals revealed a steady decline in the numbers of cysts in their brains compared with untreated controls. In addition, mortality as well as clinical signs of brain infection was absent from treated mice, whereas control mice had a high mortality rate and showed clinical signs of central nervous system infection. These results reveal remarkable in vitro and in vivo activities of 566C80 against T. gondii.\r"

The sequences of the PBP 2 genes (penA) from two penicillin-resistant isolates were almost identical (less than or equal to 1% sequence divergence) to that of a penicillin-susceptible isolate, except in a 175-bp region where the resistant and susceptible isolates differed by 27%. The nucleotide sequences of these divergent regions were identical (or almost identical) to the sequence of the corresponding region of the penA gene of N. flavescens NCTC 8263. Altered forms of PBP 2 with decreased affinity for penicillin in the two penicillin-resistant isolates of N. lactamica appear, therefore, to have arisen by the replacement of part of the N. lactamica penA gene with the corresponding region from the penA gene of N. flavescens.\r"

No correlation was observed between the inhibitions of DNA gyrase activity and topoisomerase II activity. On the other hand, the inhibitory effects of these quinolones against topoisomerase II were closely correlated with their inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, among the oxazine derivatives tested, the derivative with a methyl group at position 3 in an S configuration showed the highest activity against DNA gyrase and derivatives without a methyl group on the oxazine ring were more potent against topoisomerase II than those with a methyl group. Among these derivatives, DR-3355, the S isomer of ofloxacin, showed the highest activity against DNA gyrase and low activity against topoisomerase II. These results indicate that the methyl group on the oxazine ring plays an important role in the inhibitory activities of ofloxacin derivatives for these enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "Using the techniques of gap misrepair mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis, we have generated two novel quinolone resistance mutations of the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A protein. DNA sequencing showed these mutations to be Ser-83----Ala and Gln-106----Arg. The mutant proteins were overproduced and purified, and their enzymatic properties were analyzed and compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. With ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, the inhibition of DNA supercoiling, relaxation, and decatenation and the induction of DNA cleavage were investigated for both wild-type and mutant enzymes. In each assay, the mutant enzymes were found to require approximately 10 times more drug to inhibit the reaction or induce cleavage than was the wild-type enzyme. However, the Ca2(+)-directed DNA cleavage reaction was indistinguishable for wild-type and mutant gyrases. We discuss models for the gyrase-mediated bactericidal effects of quinolone drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro activities of nine quinolones (seven fluoroquinolones, nalidixic acid, and acrosoxacin) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were compared with those of the glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin. MICs against 160 strains of ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC, less than 2.0 micrograms/ml) MRSA and 40 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) MRSA were determined. The following MICs for 50% of the strains tested (in micrograms per milliliter) were obtained for ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant strains, respectively: tosufloxacin, 0.06 and 2.0; ofloxacin, 0.25 and 16; ciprofloxacin, 0.5 and 16; pefloxacin, 0.5 and 32; acrosoxacin, 1.0 and greater than 256; enoxacin, 1.0 and 64; fleroxacin, 1.0 and 32; norfloxacin, 2.0 and 64; nalidixic acid, 64 and 512; teicoplanin, 1.0 and 1.0; vancomycin, 2.0 and 2.0. In mutation rate studies using a range of antibiotic concentrations to reflect those achievable in vivo, resistant mutants grew only on plates containing nalidixic acid (rate of mutation to resistance, 10(-7) to 10(-8) and on plates containing low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin (rate of mutation to resistance, 10(-8) to 10(-9). In time-kill studies, 99.9% killing was found within 8 h for all of the quinolones tested (norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were not tested). Teicoplanin and vancomycin were less rapidly bactericidal. For the clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA, different levels and patterns of quinolone resistance were found. Generally, cross-resistance among the fluoroquinolones was complete; however, incomplete cross-resistance did occur with the nonfluorinated quinolone acrosoxacin.\r"

The toxic effect of endotoxin and tobramycin, alone or in combination, was investigated in primary cultures of rabbit proximal tubular cells grown to confluence in serum-free medium. Sodium-dependent uptakes of Pi and alpha-methylglucopyranoside (MGP) and enzymatic activities (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] released as a marker of cell necrosis and gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase [NAG] present in the homogenate as markers of brush border membrane and lysosome integrity) were measured. Cells were exposed to (i) endotoxin (20 mg/liter), tobramycin (1 mM), or endotoxin plus tobramycin for 48 h, or (ii) endotoxin (100 mg/liter), tobramycin (4 mM), or endotoxin plus tobramycin for 72 h. Endotoxin alone did not alter Pi uptake, but tobramycin inhibited Pi uptake through a decrease in Vmax. The effect was not enhanced by the combination of endotoxin and tobramycin. Endotoxin and tobramycin alone exerted no significant effect upon MGP uptake, but strong inhibition of the Vmax was observed after exposure to a combination of endotoxin plus tobramycin, without alteration of the Km. Endotoxin decreased residual GGT activity in the cell homogenate. Tobramycin increased LDH release in the medium and NAG activity in the homogenate. Endotoxin plus tobramycin resulted in an additive effect upon LDH and NAG activities. In conclusion, by disturbing apical membrane integrity, endotoxin increased tobramycin toxicity in vitro in the absence of serum hormonal mediator.\r"

  ".W": "A study was done to determine the genetic locus responsible for altered expression of AmpC beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E and several mutants derived from E. cloacae 029. These phenotypes were defined by units of enzyme activity found in sonic extracts of cells before and after induction with cefoxitin and included (units uninduced/units induced) the wild-type (7/219), high-level constitutive (10,911/10,862), temperature-sensitive (at 30 degrees C 82/706 and at 42 degrees C 5,031/6,020), and hyperinducible (19/1,688) phenotypes. When the ampD region of each E. cloacae strain was cloned and introduced into an ampD mutant Escherichia coli strain, the altered phenotypes were found to reside within this locus. Furthermore, transformants containing wild-type ampD were poorly inducible at 42 degrees C while those with high-level constitutive or hyperinducible ampD were unaffected by temperature. Since the source of ampD was the only variable in these E. coli transformants, these results suggested that ampD encodes a protein that is involved in sensing the inducer. To test this possibility, the responses to different inducers of E. coli transformants containing various ampD regions were assessed. In the presence of wild-type ampD, transformants responded equally to cefoxitin and cefotetan, regardless of temperature. In the presence of temperature-sensitive ampD, induction by cefotetan was similar to that by cefoxitin at 30 degrees C but greater than that by cefoxitin at 42 degrees C. These results suggest that ampD encodes a protein involved in induction of AmpC beta-lactamase in E. cloacae.\r"

These two groups were comparable for demographic parameters and degree of exposure. Clinical manifestations were of similar severities in the two groups, but parasite counts were significantly higher in the subjects who received no prophylaxis (P less than 0.00005). Side effects of prophylaxis were frequent (31%), minor, and related to chloroquine, and they usually resolved within 4 to 6 weeks. Prolonged administration of Ch-P is safe and effectively prevents P. falciparum malaria in an endemic area with a high prevalence of chloroquine resistance.\r"

Plasma drug levels determined by bioassay were higher than those measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, indicating that one or more active metabolites were formed. Individual high-performance liquid chromatography plasma rufloxacin concentrations were fitted with a one-compartment open model with first-order input. There were considerable variations in the plasma concentration-time profiles among subjects; for example, the elimination half-life in plasma varied from 14.6 to 95.5 h. However, pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for the two periods did not differ significantly. These results suggest that the intrasubject variation in the pharmacokinetics of rufloxacin is usually small in spite of the considerable intersubject variation.\r"

There was no significant difference between 0.001% tretinoin and the vehicle, and no obvious dermal changes were detected in any group.

  ".W": "Using repeated minimal erythema dose (MED) testing, we investigated the magnitude and duration of tolerance to short-wave UV radiation in the B range (UV-B) in 37 patients with psoriasis who received at least 12 UV-B phototherapy treatments. Without substantial erythema developing, half of the patients received UV-B doses in excess of 13 times their pretreatment MED dose and a fourth received UV-B doses in excess of 28 times their pretreatment MED dose. On average, tolerance faded to about half that present at the last UV-B treatment in 3 weeks. Six weeks after therapy was stopped, most posttreatment MEDs were less than twice the pretreatment MED. The magnitude of tolerance achieved and the rate of decay did not vary with skin type. Our findings indicate that repeated exposures to suberythemal or mildly erythematous doses of UV-B can induce exceptional degrees of tolerance to UV-B radiation. The duration of this increase in tolerance is, however, short.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized study to assess the effects of tretinoin pretreatment on healing after trichloroacetic acid (TCA) chemical peel. Sixteen male patients (mean age, 67 years) with actinically damaged skin were treated daily with 0.1% tretinoin and placebo creams to the left and right halves of the face and the left and right forearms and hands, respectively, for 14 days prior to the 35% TCA peel. We subjectively noted that during the peel, \"frosting\" was more pronounced and uniform and occurred earlier in tretinoin-pretreated skin in 94% of the patients. Healed skin was measured planimetrically, and the healed area was determined with point stereology. Regardless of pretreatment, the face healed twice as fast as the forearm or hand. In all regions, the mean area healed was significantly greater in skin that had been pretreated with tretinoin. The differences between tretinoin and placebo, respectively, in healed skin were maximal after 5 days for the face (68% vs 52%), after 11 days for the forearms (72% vs 24%), and after 9 days for the hands (61% vs 29%). After 7 days, 75% of the tretinoin-pretreated hemifaces were completely healed, as opposed to 31% of the placebo-pretreated hemifaces. By visual inspection, we could not appreciate a cosmetic difference between tretinoin- and placebo-pretreated skin 2 weeks and 3 months after the TCA peel. We conclude that 0.1% tretinoin pretreatment for 2 weeks prior to the TCA peel will significantly speed healing, which may result in greater patient satisfaction. Patients presently being treated with tretinoin who later undergo a TCA peel might be expected to have similar results.\r"

The photosensitizer dihematoporphyrin ether and red light were used to treat normal and human papilloma virus type 18-transfected keratinocytes in vitro. Although both cell lines were sensitive to treatment, normal keratinocytes retained more dihematoporphyrin ether and were more sensitive to photodynamic therapy than were transfected cells. In vitro data fail to show the selective retention of dihematoporphyrin ether reported elsewhere in the literature in papillomas and tumors. We did not find selective uptake or retention of dihematoporphyrin ether by human papilloma virus-transfected cells, despite previously published in vivo data to the contrary. Dihematoporphyrin ether retention and thus selective photosensitivity of papillomas in vivo is not caused by individual cellular differences in the processing of dihematoporphyrin ether. In addition, because in vitro results may not parallel in vivo results, both in vivo and in vitro models must be investigated in the study of phototherapeutic agents.\r"

This condition should be recognized as an occupational dermatosis as well as the result of past incidental cuts or abrasions, which result in the development of granulomas, many in old wound scars. Differentiation from cutaneous sarcoidosis is possible with polarized light microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.\r"

  ".W": "A patient had acquired perforating dermatosis and suffered from renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and lupus vulgaris. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the bulk of the coarse granular basophilic material being extruded by transepidermal elimination was of nuclear origin obviously derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes that were particularly abundant in an early, nonperforated lesion. At the lower boundary of the material being eliminated transepidermally, leukocytes were seen to accumulate, to undergo pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and to transform into nuclear debris. As a minor component, the material contained collagen fibers with altered staining qualities and, in an early lesion, elastic fibers. We speculate that accumulation, disintegration, and enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may represent an important, hitherto disregarded driving force in transepidermal elimination. Lysosomal enzymes may later be responsible for the alteration of staining properties in collagen fibers, the degradation of elastic fibers, and for opening up the transepidermal route by impairing intercellular keratinocyte cohesion.\r"

After an 18-hour anhepatic period, a second donor liver was transplanted. During this interval, the patient was warmed with an infrared heat lamp that emitted bright visible light. Following the anhepatic period, a photodistributed cutaneous erythema was noted. The level of total serum porphyrins during the anhepatic period was significantly elevated at 1.548 mumol/L (normal, less than 0.018 mumol/L). Fractionation showed that the levels of the hydrophobic porphyrins, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin, were elevated, while the levels of the hydrophilic porphyrins remained normal. Following the successful second liver transplantation, the patient's porphyrin levels declined. This is the first reported case of acquired porphyrinemia in a liver transplant recipient.\r"

This is inconsistent with published results and current concepts of the outcome for children with cardiac malformation. Of the 222, death occurred in intrauterine life in 57, 87 died as neonates, and 31 in infancy or childhood. There are 47 survivors of whom only five have survived beyond 4 years. Factors influencing the outcome in these cases were examined further. A high mortality was associated with the presence of extracardiac anomalies in 71 (32%) and prenatal cardiac failure in 28 (13%). As many patients were referred for these reasons, referral methods preferentially select patients with a different range of heart disease from that seen postnatally. In addition, some forms of heart disease progress in severity during fetal life. Those involved in the management and counselling after diagnosis of heart disease in early pregnancy must be aware of the additional prenatal factors influencing prognosis and allow for them in making predictions of outcome.\r"

A comparative trial of three different methods of preschool vision screening is described. Some 7000 children initially aged 5 months (younger cohorts) and 30 months (older cohorts) in three matched areas entered the trial during 1987. During 18 months of follow up new visual and ocular defects among these children were ascertained through ophthalmology outpatients and from optician records. Screening at 35 months by an orthoptist based in the community is superior to conventional health visitor surveillance at 30 months and to an agreed programme of primary care screening for squint at 30-36 months as judged by screening sensitivity (100% v 50% v 50%) and the incidence of treated target conditions (17 v 3 v 5 per 1000 person years). A notable feature in the area served by the orthoptist is that 13 children received treatment for straight eyed visual acuity loss from among 1000 children whereas there were no such cases among 2500 in the comparison areas. In the younger cohorts (that is, screening at age 5-9 months) all three programmes showed equally poor results, only one of the eight treated target conditions arising from all 3500 younger children being screen detected.\r"

Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese.

The median concentrations in the different age groups varied between 7-13 micrograms alpha-lactalbumin/1 serum/1 human milk/kg body weight. Twenty-eight children with cows' milk allergy were studied before introduction of a diet free of cows' milk. Nineteen had gastrointestinal and nine skin symptoms. High serum alpha-lactalbumin concentrations were found. Only two children had alpha-lactalbumin concentrations below 100 micrograms alpha-lactalbumin/1 serum/1 human milk/kg body weight. Altogether 76 children on a diet free of cows' milk were studied directly after a cows' milk challenge; 26 developed symptoms. They had significantly higher serum alpha-lactalbumin values than the 50 children with no symptoms upon challenge. Eighteen of the 26 children with symptoms had serum alpha-lactalbumin concentrations of more than 100 micrograms/1 serum/1 human milk/kg body weight in contrast with two of the 50 with no symptoms. Total serum IgE antibodies were analysed in 43 children. No correlation was found between concentrations of serum IgE and serum alpha-lactalbumin in the children with cows' milk allergy.\r"

Fourteen of 31 children with chronic diarrhoea had giardiasis compared with only four of 33 healthy age and sex matched control children. Four of 15 malnourished children without diarrhoea were giardia positive. Twenty-three children with chronic diarrhoea were reinvestigated after treatment with metronidazole; giardia was found in 11 of them. These results show that giardia is highly prevalent in children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition and that the infection does not respond to standard therapeutic measures.\r"

The clinical and radiological features in nine patients with cystic fibrosis who had appendicitis were studied. All but one of the patients had an appendiceal abscess at surgery. Four patients had a delay in diagnosis of greater than three days before the correct diagnosis was made. This delay may have been due to a more indolent presentation or because these patients were initially considered to have distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a contrast enema demonstrates extrinsic compression of the caecum. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and gallium scans were found to be of limited help in our series.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 599 children with phenylketonuria, who had been treated early, were followed up prospectively in order to examine the association between intellectual progress from 4 to 14 years of age and control of phenylalanine concentrations. The phenylalanine rose from around 400 mumol/l during the first four years to above 900 mumol/l by 12 years. The children were divided into two cohorts: cohort I comprised 224 children born in the United Kingdom between 1964 and 1971 and cohort II 375 children born between 1972 and 1978. In a previous study it was shown that by 4 years of age these children already had a mean intelligence quotient (IQ) over half a standard deviation below general population norms, and that IQ fell linearly as average phenylalanine concentrations rose. Multiple regression was used to estimate the size of the associations between IQ at later ages and average phenylalanine concentrations in the periods between assessments, after controlling for previous IQ and phenylalanine control, social class, type of phenylketonuria, and factors relating to diagnosis and early management. For each 300 mumol/l rise in average phenylalanine concentrations for those aged 5 to 8 years IQ at 8 years fell by 4-6 points. This compared with a 7-10 point fall in IQ at 4 years for a similar rise in phenylalanine. After 8 years of age the association between IQ and phenylalanine control disappeared in cohort I but persisted in cohort II and was significant up to 10 years of age, although the association was smaller than at 8 years.\r"

There were eight deaths due to leukaemia, five of the myeloid type, in first and second degree relatives; this is significantly more than the expected on the basis of national age specific mortality rates. In comparison, mortality among siblings, parents, aunts and uncles, and grandparents from all causes was within the expected. Screening the five patients with myeloid leukaemia for the delta F508 mutation showed that four were carriers of this mutation. It is concluded that carriers of the delta F508 mutation may have an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia. This could happen through the direct effect of the cystic fibrosis gene itself, or through its influence on another gene, such as the met oncogene, or gene(s) involved in granulocyte function on the long arm of chromosome 7.\r"

There were two neonatal deaths in the study group but none among the controls. Hypoplasia of the finger or toenails was a common congenital anomaly in those infants whose mothers had received phenytoin alone or in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs (11 of 40, 28%). The mean serum phenytoin concentration was higher among mothers of infants with hypoplastic nails than among those with normal nails. Jitteriness was a common neonatal condition affecting infants of epileptic mothers (11 of 61, 18%) but not controls The mean cord serum phenytoin concentrations were similar among jittery and non-jittery infants. At follow up (after excluding one infant with Down's syndrome from the study group) the infants seemed to have developed normally, though one had serious learning difficulties at school. We suggest that hypoplasia of the nails is related to high maternal serum concentrations of phenytoin, and though 18% of infants born to epileptic mothers were jittery compared with no control infants this may not be the result of withdrawal of the drug in all cases.\r"

Infantile cerebral palsy (ICD Code 343-) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22%) cases. On 28 (38%) certificates there was no mention of any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28%) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented.\r"

Lateral and anteroposterior chest diameters and chest circumference correlated with PEFR but did not differ between index and control cases.

The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury.\r"

Reduction in SaO2 was positively correlated with duration of apnoea, but the scatter of results was such that reductions in SaO2 of up to 40% occurred with apnoeas of less than 10 seconds duration. The median initial SaO2 was significantly lower in those episodes that resulted in bradycardia (92% compared with 95%), and there was also a significantly greater reduction in median SaO2 (9% compared with 5%). This study illustrates the difficulty of setting alarm limits for the detection of apnoea. We suggest that rather than simply detecting apnoea it is more appropriate to monitor heart rate and SaO2 in infants with recurrent apnoea.\r"

Tricuspid regurgitation was detected at some stage in all preterm babies and most of those born at full term. Pulmonary arterial pressure could be measured from peak regurgitant velocity in babies with pansystolic regurgitation. The incidence of pansystolic regurgitation among 34 term babies at 0-12, 13-36, and 32-72 hours of age was 22, 27, and 19%, and in 17 preterm babies (within the same age groups) was 53, 50, and 31%, respectively. Estimates of pulmonary artery pressure in the term babies were in accord with known catheter values. Pressure fell rapidly during the first day in all 51 babies. The ratio of pulmonary:systemic arterial pressure was comparable between the two groups throughout. Ductal flow patterns mirrored the fall in this ratio with age--bidirectional flow was associated with a ratio of between 0.88:1 and 1.22:1 and high velocity left to right flow with a ratio of between 0.49:1 and 0.66:1. Both these techniques are noninvasive ways of assessing neonatal pulmonary arterial pressure.\r"

There was a 27% increase in the cardiac output as a result of increasing stroke volume, whereas heart rate did not change significantly. Mean blood pressure increased by nearly the same extent as cardiac output (21%), so that the overall resistance remained unchanged. Packed cell volume, red cell aggregation, and red cell deformability did not change significantly during the first five postnatal days. Plasma viscosity rose significantly (by 12%) so that whole blood viscosity increased during that period.

Lungs were examined histologically by light and electron microscopy, and immunocytochemical studies were used to identify nerves. There was extension of medial smooth muscle distally along the arterial pathway so that most precapillary arteries had completely muscular walls, which in some cases completely obliterated the vessel lumen. Enlarged endothelial cells also contributed to the reduction in the size of the lumen. Nerve fibres accompanying muscular arteries were found in the alveolar region, more distal than is normal. The predominant neuropeptide was the vasoconstrictor tyrosine. Possible aetiological factors in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn are increased muscularity of the peripheral pulmonary arteries antenatally, an increase in the number of vasoconstrictor nerves, or an imbalance in the production of leukotrienes and prostacyclins in the perinatal period.\r"

Survival was independently related to weight, gestation, sex, and inborn delivery. When these variables had been taken into account, survival was 56% greater at the end of the decade compared with 1980. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage (diagnosed by cranial ultrasound scanning) was related to birth weight, gestation, sex, inborn delivery, and caesarean section, but there was no significant trend in the incidence with time. Rates of caesarean section in this group increased from 31% in 1980 to over 50% more recently. Haemorrhage affecting the brain parenchyma was related to gestation and inborn delivery, and showed a small but significant decline over time. The lack of association between changes in survival rates and rates of cerebral haemorrhage may indicate that factors associated with both neonatal mortality and the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage may not be causally related as previously assumed.\r"

Factors associated with renal calcification included hypophosphataemia, hypercalcaemia, hypercreatininaemia, and prolonged oxygen requirement during the first month of life. Multivariate analysis showed that the strongest clinical indicator of calcification was duration of oxygen treatment. Infants who still required oxygen treatment at 28 days had a 62% chance of developing renal calcification.\r"

The purpose of this study, using the data of a large randomised trial on iron prophylaxis during pregnancy, was to find out whether iron supplementation causes fetal growth to deteriorate. At their first antenatal visit, 2912 pregnant women were randomised into non-routine iron and routine iron supplementation. The mean length of gestation was shorter in the non-routine group. Birth weight did not differ between the groups, but due to longer gestations boys in the group receiving routine iron were taller than in the non-routine group. In both groups, whether studied by various values of packed cell volume or correlation coefficients, the lower the packed cell volume, the heavier and taller the infant and heavier the placenta. These negative correlations could be seen even with a packed cell volume measured early in pregnancy. Standardising for blood pressure did not influence the correlation coefficients. The correlation between a high ratio for packed cell volume and poor fetal growth thus may not be caused by iron supplementation, nor mediated by blood pressure, but by some other mechanism.\r"

Patient triggered ventilation was administered via the SLE ventilator at a series of inflation times (0.24, 0.3, and 0.4 seconds). Comparison was made between the trigger systems of the trigger delay, inflation volume delivered, and proportion of spontaneous respiratory efforts detected. The airway pressure trigger gave a superior performance: at the two lower inflation times the trigger delay was shorter and inflation volume delivered greater. At the longest inflation time a greater proportion of respiratory efforts were detected. We conclude the airway pressure trigger should be used in preference to the respiration monitor as the triggering system of choice for neonatal patient triggered ventilation.\r"

Head up tilting to 45 degrees achieved the best oxygenation at the angles studied, and decreased the respiratory and heart rates; there was no significant change in blood pressure. Residue in the stomach was also significantly less at 45 degrees, and the neonates' weight gain was higher. We conclude that nursing stable very low birthweight infants with a higher head up tilt than is conventional may have some advantages.\r"

Four of the uncapsulated strains were of biotype III, and three were of biotype II. None of the strains of H influenzae was of biotype IV, which has been reported to be characteristic of neonatal and genital isolates of H influenzae. All nine mothers had some sign of infection at the time of or shortly after delivery. H influenzae was isolated from five mothers: from the blood (n = 1) or from the placenta or cervix (n = 4).

Age at operation was 53.9 +/- 8.4 years, and 1485 were men (88%). Angina was present in 1637 patients (96%). There was single-vessel disease in 306 patients (18%), double-vessel in 642 (38%), triple-vessel in 550 patients (32%) and left main stenosis in 200 (12%). Preoperative left ventricular quality was good in 1185 (70%), poor in 508 (30%), and unknown in five patients. Survival at 20 years was as follows: for single-vessel disease, 40%; double-vessel, 26%; triple-vessel, 20%; and left main, 25%. At 20 years of follow-up, 67% of surviving patients were asymptomatic and 26% were improved. Antianginal drug therapy consisted of nitrates in 49% of patients and beta-blockers in 26%. Graft patency at 0 to 5 years was 633 of 780 grafts (81%); at 6 to 10 years, 415 of 606 grafts (68%); at 11 to 15 years, 271 of 449 grafts (60%); and at 16 to 20 years, 65 of 140 grafts (46%). Coronary bypass reoperation was performed in 324 patients (19%) and survival of these patients was 62% compared to 37% for nonreoperation patients (p less than 0.05). Cox analysis demonstrated that the major determinants of survival related to age at operation, extent of coronary disease, quality of ventricle, history of stroke, and preoperative congestive heart failure. At 20 years of follow-up of this early experience with coronary bypass, 76% of surviving patients had one or more patent grafts and the probability of freedom from reoperation was 0.62.\r"

A new electrophysiologic screening test was developed to identify those patients at risk for development of postoperative AF. The test was validated in 50 patients (43 men and 7 women) with a mean age of 59.6 +/- 1.3 years who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with or without other cardiac surgical procedures. After aortic and venous cannulation, but before initiation of bypass, the mid-right atrium was stimulated with a bipolar probe at 25 microA for 3 seconds. Alternating current was increased by 25 microA until AF was induced or up to a maximum of 200 microA. Postoperative AF occurred in 18 patients (36%), 17 of whom had inducible AF (sensitivity = 0.94). Of the remaining 32 AF-free patients, 13 had negative tests (specificity = 0.41). Age and sex were not factors affecting inducibility, although patients who developed AF were older than those who were AF free (63.6 versus 57.3 years, p = 0.02). Length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer for those with postoperative AF than for AF-free patients (3.6 versus 1.9 days, p = 0.02). The negative predictive value of the test was 0.93, and the positive value was 0.47. These data show that this new intraoperative technique may be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative AF. Prophylactic therapy can therefore be directed to only those patients at risk for postoperative AF.\r"

  ".W": "Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has been performed in 15 consecutive neonates and children since 1987. Diagnoses include hypoplastic left heart syndrome (5 patients), critical aortic stenosis with small left ventricle (1 patient), complex cyanotic heart disease (6 patients), and cardiomyopathy (3 patients). Twelve patients survived operation and have been followed from 1 to 45 months. Patients less than 6 years of age are managed with cyclosporine +/- azathioprine; in older patients steroid weaning is attempted. Monitoring for rejection is performed with serial echocardiography in patients under 6 years of age; older patients undergo serial biopsies. Actuarial freedom from rejection was 26% 3 months after operation; 47% were free of infection 6 months after operation. There have been no late deaths. Actuarial survival at 3 years is 79%. Nine patients have undergone postoperative catheterization. Resting hemodynamics were normal in every patient. All long-term survivors are asymptomatic and fully active. It is concluded that cardiac transplantation in neonates and children is an effective treatment option for end-stage cardiomyopathy or otherwise incurable congenital heart disease. Long-term survivors have excellent potential for full rehabilitation.\r"

  ".U": "91221748\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of severe infection on luminal transport of amino acids and glucose by the small intestine were investigated. Studies were done in endotoxin-treated rats and in septic patients who underwent resection of otherwise normal small bowel. In rats the kinetics of the brush border glutamine transporter and the glutaminase enzyme were examined. In patients the effects of severe infection on the transport of glutamine, alanine, leucine, and glucose were studied. Transport was measured using small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles that were prepared by Mg++ aggregation/differential centrifugation. Uptake of radiolabeled substrate was measured using a rapid mixing/filtration technique. Vesicles demonstrated 15-fold enrichments of enzyme markers, classic overshoots, transport into an osmotically active space, and similar 2-hour equilibrium values. The sodium-dependent pathway accounted for nearly 90% of total carrier-mediated transport. Kinetic studies on rat jejunal glutaminase indicated a decrease in activity as early as 2 hours after endotoxin secondary to a decrease in enzyme affinity for glutamine (Km = 2.23 +/- 0.20 mmol/L [millimolar] in controls versus 4.55 +/- 0.67 in endotoxin, p less than 0.03), rather than a change in Vmax. By 12 hours the decrease in glutaminase activity was due to a decrease in Vmax (222 +/- 36 nmol/mg protein/min in controls versus 96 +/- 16 in endotoxin, p less than 0.03) rather than a significant change in Km. Transport data indicated a decrease in sodium-dependent jejunal glutamine uptake 12 hours after endotoxin secondary to a 35% reduction in maximal transport velocity (Vmax = 325 +/- 12 pmol/mg protein/10 sec in controls versus 214 +/- 8 in endotoxin, p less than 0.0001) with no change in Km (carrier affinity). Sodium-dependent glutamine transport was also decreased in septic patients, both in the jejunum (Vmax for control jejunum = 786 +/- 96 pmol/mg protein/10 sec versus 417 +/- 43 for septic jejunum, p less than 0.01) and in the ileum (Vmax of control ileum = 1126 +/- 66 pmol/mg protein/10 sec versus 415 +/- 24 in septic ileum, p less than 0.001) The rate of jejunal transport of alanine, leucine, and glucose was also decreased in septic patients by 30% to 50% (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that there is a generalized down-regulation of sodium-dependent carrier-mediated substrate transport across the brush border during severe infection, which probably occurs secondary to a decrease in transporter synthesis or an increase in the rate of carrier degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The authors have established the only long-term cell line of a functioning human pancreatic carcinoid tumor (BON) that produces tumors in nude mice. In this study the authors examined the effect of three agents, alpha-interferon (IFN), a somatostatin analog, SMS 201-995 (SMS), and an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), on the growth of BON tumors. BON was implanted bilaterally as 3-mm2 pieces (subcutaneously [sc]) into male BALB/c nude mice. In the first study, 23 mice were randomized to four groups: control, IFN (1 x 10(6) units, sc, four times a day), IFN + SMS (300 micrograms/kg, intraperitoneally, three times a day), and IFN + 3% DFMO in drinking water. Treatments were initiated on day of tumor implantation. In the second study, mice were randomized to six groups: control, IFN, SMS, DFMO, IFN + SMS, IFN + DFMO, and IFN + SMS + DFMO. Treatments were started on day 15 after tumor implantation. Tumor area and body weights were measured weekly. In both studies mice were killed on day 28 after BON implantation and tumors removed, weighed, and analyzed for DNA and RNA content. In the first study, IFN either alone or in combination with SMS or DFMO suppressed BON tumor growth. When treatment was initiated after established tumor growth (study 2), however, the only effective treatments for suppression of growth of BON were IFN + DFMO and IFN + DFMO + SMS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91221750\r", 
  ".W": "Acute rupture was confirmed at operation in 117 patients treated for descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Descending thoracic (n = 80) aortic rupture occurred into lung or esophagus in 8, the pleural cavity in 49, and the mediastinum in 23. Upper abdominal aortic (n = 37) rupture occurred into peritoneal cavity in 3 and into retroperitoneal tissues in 34. Aneurysmal size (range, 5 to 17 cm; median, 8 cm) could be determined retrospectively in 86 patients; 59 (74%) descending thoracic and 27 (73%) abdominal aorta. Size (external diameter) in the former was 8 (14%), 5 to 6 cm; 21 (36%), 6 to 8 cm; 23 (39%), 8 to 10 cm; and 7 (12%) greater than 10 cm. Size at the abdominal site was similar. Thus size was not greater than 10 cm in 52 (88%) (range, 5 to 10 cm), which contradicts opinions that thoracic aneurysms rupture only when size exceeds 10 cm. Twenty-nine patients (25%) were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg), of whom 16 (55%) had cardiac arrest before operation. Associated conditions included advanced age (greater than or equal to 75 years) in 26 (22%), coronary artery disease in 41 (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 46 (39%), renal insufficiency in 25 (21%), and cardiovascular disease in 22 (18%). The overall early survival rate (30-day) was 89 of 117 patients (76%); 69% in patients with hypotension, 56% of patients with cardiac arrest, 88% in good-risk patients. Five-year (Kaplan-Meier) survival was 28%. Because elective operation is associated with 92% survival, this should be considered before rupture when aneurysm is 5 cm or larger in good-risk patients, in patients with symptomatic aneurysms, and in most patients with larger aneurysms.\r"

Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia.\r"

The methodology is designed to determine morbidity rate, mortality rate, cost, and length of stay, as well as to understand the effect of pre-existing chronic disease, physician, and hospital volume on these outcome variables. The data source consisted of hospital discharge abstract data uniformly collected on all admissions (N = 5.9 million) to acute care hospitals in the state. In the decade 1979 to 1988, 11,199 patients underwent CE. Mortality rate from CE was 2.1%, and the postoperative stroke rate was 3.7% over this period. High physician volume decreased the mortality rate (p less than 0.05) and stroke rate (p less than 0.01) by 50% and significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced hospital cost and length of stay independent of patient complexity. Examination of cost data, adjusted for inflation, showed a decrease in mean cost for CE over the decade. Thus physicians are providing better care for less hospital dollars. Both patient and payor outcome is improved by concentrating CE patients in the hands of high-volume surgeons. Although the data suggests this trend is already evolving, the pace of this evolution can be expected to increase as payors recognize that regionalization of this procedure lowers costs.\r"

Nine patients with superficial femoral artery occlusions of 4.5 to 49 cm in length were operated on and the recanalized artery harvested for pathologic examination. There were two arterial perforations. The ease of recanalization was determined by plaque composition. Heavily calcified and yellow fibro-fatty lesions were rapidly removed. Smooth white fibrous lesions resisted laser ablation. Direct angioscopy often disclosed discontinuous areas of occlusion that were more susceptible to recanalization. These were not seen on preoperative arteriograms. Microscopic examination of the specimens showed a central core of ablation. There was no evidence of acute damage to the vessel wall, with intact internal elastic lamina demonstrated in the recanalized segments. It appears that fibrous lesions will require a different laser for ablation; however, the delivery/angioscope systems function satisfactorily.\r"

  ".W": "This retrospective review of data collected during a recent 42-month period from 58 consecutive patients with ischemic nephropathy submitted to operative management in the authors' center was undertaken to report the rate of decline in their renal function during the period before intervention and to examine the impact of operation on their outcome. Based on serum creatinine values, immediate preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates (EGFR) ranged from 0 to 46 mL/minute (mean, 23.85 +/- 9.76 mL/minute). Eight patients were dialysis dependent or anuric at the time of operation. Patients with at least three sequential measurements for calculations of EGFR changes during the 6 months before operation (n = 50) and the first 12 months after operation (n = 32) were used to describe the preoperative rate of decline in EGFR and the impact of operation on this decrease in the operative survivors. In addition comparative analyses of data from patients with unilateral versus bilateral lesions and patients classified as having improvement in EGFR versus no improvement after operation were performed. Comparison of the immediate preoperative EGFR with the immediate postoperative EGFR for the entire group showed significant improvement in response to operation. Likewise the rate of deterioration in EGFR for the total group was improved after operation. A similar improvement in the rate of deterioration in EGFR was seen in the subgroup of patients who received an immediate improvement in EGFR in response to operation. These data argue that ischemic nephropathy is a rapidly progressive form of renal insufficiency. Although individual responses to operation were heterogeneous, renal revascularization may provide both immediate improvement in renal function and an improvement in its rate of deterioration during follow-up in patients with ischemic nephropathy.\r"

Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.0%. Postoperative surveillance identified 18 stenotic grafts (4.1%), which were revised while still patent (primary revised patency); 36 grafts (8.2%) underwent revision after graft occlusion (secondary patency). Five-year life-table analysis showed overall primary revised patency of 78%, secondary patency of 83%, limb salvage of 88%, and patient survival of 66%. Femoroperoneal and inframalleolar bypasses fared well. The presence of diabetes did not diminish late graft patency. In contrast to reversed vein grafts, long infrapopliteal in situ grafts had long-term secondary patency similar to shorter femoropopliteal bypass grafts (p greater than 0.05). These results, coupled with the versatility and simplicity of the technique as used in the present series, suggest that in situ vein grafting is the procedure of choice for long infrapopliteal bypass.\r"

Eleven of eighteen patients 12 years or younger (61%) received antivenin, whereas 12 of 49 patients older than 12 years (24%) received antivenin (p = 0.0085, Fisher's exact test). Second species of snake was an indicator. Sixty-two snakes were identified (93%). Of 39 rattlesnake (Crotalus and Sistrurus) bites, 20 patients received antivenin (53%), but of 23 copperhead and water moccasin (Agkistrodon) bites, only three patients (12.5%) received antivenin (p = 0.0025). Antivenin may be indicated for use in systemic rattlesnake envenomation, especially in younger patients.\r"

To answer this question, the authors performed a 5-year review of 70 limbs in 67 patients. Patients were identified as presenting with major lower extremity trauma and an associated arterial injury. Nineteen (27%) of the 70 limbs were amputated. Limb salvage was not related to the presence or absence of shock and order of repair (orthopedic or vascular). No statistical difference was noted between the time of injury to operative repair in either the amputated or limb salvage group. Limb salvage was related to warm ischemia time and the quantitative degree of arterial, nerve, bone, muscle, skin, and venous injury. A limb salvage index (LSI) was formulated based on the degree of injury to these systems. All 51 patients with an LSI score of less than 6 had successful limb salvage (p less than 0.001). All 19 patients with an LSI score of 6 or greater had amputations (p less than 0.001). Although statistics cannot replace clinical judgment, this index can be a valuable objective tool in the evaluation of the patient with a severely traumatized extremity.\r"

Multicentered, blinded, prospective randomized studies were developed comparing 250 mL of HSD versus 250 mL of normal crystalloid solution administered before routine prehospital and emergency center resuscitation. During a 13-month period, 422 patients were enrolled, 211 of whom subsequently underwent operative procedures. Three hundred fifty-nine patients met criteria for efficacy analysis, 51% of whom were in the HSD group. Seventy-two per cent of all patients were victims of penetrating trauma. The mean injury severity score (19), Trauma Score plus Injury Severity Score (TRISS) probability of survival, revised trauma scores (5.9), age, ambulance times, preinfusion blood pressure, and etiology distribution were identical between groups. The total amount of fluid administered, white blood cell count, arterial blood gases, potassium, or bicarbonate also were identical between groups. The HSD group had an improved blood pressure (p = 0.024). Hematocrit, sodium chloride, and osmolality levels were significantly elevated in the Emergency Center. Although no difference in overall survival was demonstrated, the HSD group requiring surgery did have a better survival (p = 0.02), with some variance among centers. The HSD group had fewer complications that the standard treatment group (7 versus 24). A greater incidence of adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and coagulopathy occurred in the standard treatment group. No anaphylactoid nor Dextran-related coagulopathies occurred in the HSD group. Although this trial demonstrated trends supportive of HSD in hypotensive hemorrhagic shock patients requiring surgery, a larger sample size will be required to establish which subgroups of trauma patients might maximally benefit from the prehospital use of a small volume of hyperosmolar solution. This study demonstrates the safety of administering 250 mL 7.5% HDS to this group of patients.\r"

The average Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index score was 23.9 for the diversion group and 26 for the primary repair group. There were five (17.9%) septic-related complications in the diversion group. This included four intra-abdominal abscesses and one subcutaneous wound infection. There were six (21.4%) septic-related complications in the primary repair group. This included one wound infection, two positive blood cultures, and three intra-abdominal abscesses. There were no episodes of suture line failure in the primary repair/anastomosis group. The authors conclude that, independent of associated risk factors, primary repair or resection and anastomosis should be considered for treatment of all patients in the civilian population with penetrating colon wounds.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercalcemic reperfusion of the postischemic heart has been associated with ventricular dysfunction and with ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria. The isolated working rat heart model was used to correlate ventricular function, mitochondrial damage, and high-energy phosphate content with degree and timing of hypercalcemia during reperfusion. When administered early during reperfusion, calcium chloride caused a dose-dependent deterioration in ventricular function, whereas calcium augmented function when it was administered after a 15-minute period of normocalcemic reperfusion. Hearts treated with calcium early during reperfusion demonstrated more mitochondrial damage and decreased stores of adenosine triphosphate than those in which calcium administration was delayed. The data indicate that a period of normocalcemic reperfusion should precede calcium administration in the postischemic heart. Mitochondrial damage resulting in decreased synthesis of adenosine triphosphate is likely the cause of ventricular dysfunction associated with calcium administration in the postischemic heart.\r"

They were classified into four groups: group 1 (lifeless), 38; group 2 (agonal), 16; group 3 (shock), 33; and group 4 (stable), 22. Thirty-six patients in group 1 (94%) and 8 of 16 patients in group 2 (50%) underwent emergency room thoracotomy; 24 of 33 in group 3 (73%) and 20 of 22 (90%) underwent thoracotomy in the operating room. Twenty-one (38%) of 55 patients undergoing emergency room thoracotomy survived, whereas 47 (87%) of 54 patients undergoing operating room thoracotomy survived. Survival was 12 of 38 (31%) in group 1, 11 of 16 (69%) in group 2, 26 of 33 (79%) in group 3, and 18 of 22 (82%) in group 4 with an overall survival of 67 of 109 (61%). Gunshot wounds of the heart portend a worse prognosis than stab wounds. Survival of gunshot wounds was 20 of 49 (40%) compared with 47 survivors of 60 stab wounds (78%). Aggressive treatment, including emergency room thoracotomy, is justified for lifeless and deteriorating cardiac injury victims.\r"

  ".W": "Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest.\r"

  ".W": "Temporary atrial and ventricular pacing in the DVI, VVI, and AOO modes using atrioventricular sequential DVI devices is routinely used in cardiac operations. This study evaluated a new temporary external DDD pacemaker (Medtronic 5345 External Pulse Generator) capable of ten pacing modes. Thirty-nine devices have been applied to 38 adult patients (27 male, 11 female) after a variety of open heart procedures. Group 1 had atrial pacing wires placed 1.5 to 2.0 cm apart superiorly on the right atrium, group 2 had atrial wires placed 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart on the right atrial free wall, and group 3 had atrial wires placed on the right atrial free wall 0.8 cm apart, using a Silastic ring for fixation. Ventricular wires were placed on the free wall (group 1) or the diaphragmatic surface (groups 2 and 3) of the right ventricle. Postoperative atrial and ventricular sensing and pacing thresholds were obtained on return to the intensive care unit; analysis of variance demonstrated a significantly greater atrial sensing threshold in group 3. Four patients in group 1 permanently lost atrial sensing, 1 patient in group 2 intermittently lost atrial sensing at 24 hours with return at 36 hours postoperatively, and 1 patient in group 1 lost ventricular sensing capability. All other patients had adequate atrial and ventricular sensing capability documented until elective pacemaker removal (mean, 166 hours; range, 17 to 667.5 hours). Nineteen patients required some form of temporary pacing postoperatively; 11 patients demonstrated hemodynamic benefit from a pacing mode that is not available on the currently used DVI devices, and 7 of these required true DDD pacing capability. Six patients benefited from atrial pacing with adequate atrial sensing and simultaneous ventricular backup. Burst pacing with the device was used successfully to treat postoperative atrial flutter in 2 patients. We conclude that temporary external DDD pacing is feasible and effective in postoperative cardiac surgical patients. Atrial sensing is possible in most patients but electrode positioning is important for adequate thresholds. In some patients, hemodynamic as well as electrophysiologic improvement can be demonstrated with universal DDD pacing capability as compared with standard DVI pacing.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable controversy exists regarding relative morbidity associated with the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and internal mammary artery (IMA) graft in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. As a part of the cooperative study on use of antiplatelet drugs for graft patency, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected on 1,150 patients who underwent either SVG (n = 656) or IMA anastomosis (n = 494) to the left anterior descending coronary artery. There were no differences in baseline characteristics of patients, distribution of randomization among treatment groups, and total number of distal anastomoses performed between the two groups. The aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, operative time, and chest tube drainage were greater (p = 0.0001) in the patients with IMA grafts compared with SVG. However, there was no difference in the operative mortality rate, the amount of blood and blood products received, the reoperation rate for control of postoperative bleeding, and incidence of wound complications between the two groups. The early and 1-year patency rates for the IMA were slightly but not significantly better than the SVG patency rates (92.8% versus 90.1% for 1-year patency; p = 0.309). In conclusion, use of IMA is associated with a longer operative time as well as increased postoperative bleeding compared with the SVG. It, however, does not increase operative mortality or postoperative morbidity.\r"
