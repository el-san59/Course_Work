  ".W": "Neutrophils migrate to areas of inflammation and, when stimulated, produce O2-, H2O2, and other reactive O2 metabolites. To assess the effects of stimulated neutrophils on enterocytes, rat enterocytes were incubated with peripheral neutrophils. To assess cell viability, trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase and protein release were measured. When 10(6) enterocytes/mL were incubated with 2.5 x 10(5) neutrophils/mL stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, trypan blue exclusion decreased and lactate dehydrogenase and protein release increased. With the addition of 0.10 mg/mL of superoxide dismutase, trypan blue exclusion further decreased and lactate dehydrogenase and protein release increased. This suggests that H2O2- or H2O2/O2(-)-derived metabolites are more damaging to isolated enterocytes than O2-. To test this hypothesis, enterocytes were incubated with xanthine and increasing concentrations of xanthine oxidase in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase. With increasing concentrations of xanthine oxidase, the cell number decreased and protein release increased. With the addition of superoxide dismutase, fewer cells were present, suggesting that cell lysis occurred. Protein release was further increased by the addition of superoxide dismutase. Enterocytes were then incubated with leucine and increasing concentrations of amino acid oxidase. With increasing concentrations of amino acid oxidase, trypan blue exclusion decreased and protein and lactate dehydrogenase release increased. These effects were ameliorated by the addition of 500 IU catalase/mL. These data suggest that O2- and H2O2, whether created by stimulated neutrophils or an enzyme-generating system, are damaging to isolated enterocytes. Superoxide dismutase did not offer enterocytes protection.\r"

In a colon cancer rat model, the authors have shown that lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli induced the regression of carcinomatosis and cured 20%-30% of the rats. Some synthetic derivatives of lipid A, which are less toxic than lipopolysaccharides, were injected 14 days after the tumor cells. They induced the complete regression of peritoneal carcinomatosis consisting of numerous nodules measuring 1-5 mm in 20%-30% of rats. Only compounds with three or more hydroxymyristic acid residues were effective. In vivo effects were correlated with the capacity to induce the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but not with the capacity to induce macrophage-mediated cytolysis. It is therefore possible to synthesize weakly toxic derivatives of lipopolysaccharides retaining their antitumoral property in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relative contributions of neural reflexes and intestinal hormones to the inhibition of gastric acid secretion by intestinal fat, rats with an extrinsically denervated, transplanted segment of jejunum and those with an innervated segment of jejunum were studied. Postoperatively, meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion was measured by extragastric titration. When secretion reached a plateau, graded doses of oleic acid or saline were instilled into the jejunal segments. In both groups, acid secretion was inhibited by intrajejunal fat but not saline. At doses of 0.4 and 0.08 mmol oleic acid, there was a 25% and 17% greater maximal inhibition of plateau acid response in the innervated rats than in the transplanted rats, presumably because of the neural contribution. To examine the hormonal mediators, the effects of a somatostatin monoclonal antibody and a cholecystokinin A receptor antagonist (L-364,718) on fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion were studied in transplanted rats. Treatment of the patients with transplants with a somatostatin monoclonal antibody (2.18 mg IV) or L-364,718 (1 mg/kg IV) reduced the fat-induced inhibition of acid secretion by 95% and 28%, respectively. In conclusion, both neural and hormonal mechanisms mediate fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion, with the hormonal mechanism predominating. Somatostatin, and to a lesser extent cholecystokinin, contribute to the hormonal mechanism.\r"

However, no study using current manometric techniques has compared manometric, radiographic, and clinical findings in vigorous and classic achalasia or questioned the usefulness of making this distinction. Fifty-four cases involving patients with achalasia whose radiographic and manometric studies were performed within 6 months of each other were available for review. Patients with vigorous achalasia (n = 17), defined by amplitude greater than or equal to 37 mm Hg, and patients with classic achalasia (n = 37), defined as amplitude less than 37 mm Hg, had substantial overlap in radiographic parameters of esophageal dilation, tortuosity, and tertiary contractions. Manometric properties of repetitive waves and lower esophageal sphincter pressure and clinical aspects of chest pain, dysphagia, heartburn, and satisfactory responses to pneumatic dilation were similar in both forms of achalasia. A separate analysis of patients with mean contraction amplitude greater than 60 mm Hg revealed similar findings. It is concluded that use of amplitude as a criterion for classifying achalasia is arbitrary and of dubious value.\r"

A presumed synthetic defect in apolipoprotein B synthesis was thought to be responsible for this disorder. The present study quantitates apoprotein B synthesis and apolipoprotein B messenger RNA levels in duodenal mucosa from normal patients and four patients with abetalipoproteinemia. After in vitro [3H]leucine incorporation, small intestinal biopsy specimens from three of four patients with abetalipoproteinemia synthesized immunoprecipitable apolipoprotein B of identical mobility (on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis) to normal apolipoprotein B. In abetalipoproteinemia, the apolipoprotein B content of intestinal mucosa by radioimmunoassay was 15% of normal mucosal values, whereas apolipoprotein B messenger RNA quantitation showed 3-20-fold increased levels compared with normal mucosa. In one patient, smaller-molecular-weight fragments of apolipoprotein B were immunoprecipitated from duodenal biopsy specimens. The synthesis rates and messenger RNA levels of two other chylomicron apoproteins (apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-IV) were found to be reduced by 50%. These results show the synthesis of immunologically recognizable apolipoprotein B48 in abetalipoproteinemia. The significance of mucosal apolipoprotein B content in abetalipoproteinemia is discussed in terms of factors controlling apolipoprotein B synthesis in normal mucosa and in abetalipoproteinemia.\r"

This augmentation of secretagogue-stimulated acid secretion was dependent on extracellular calcium because potentiation was abolished by calcium depletion of the medium or in the presence of the calcium antagonist lanthanum chloride. Potentiation was independent of the H2 and muscarinic receptors and did not appear to involve guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins. Proton pump activity was unaffected by indomethacin. Furthermore, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs increased calcium efflux through the plasma membrane, as measured by calcium 45, and decreased endogenous prostaglandin E2 content. Exogenous dimethyl prostaglandin E2 inhibited the potentiating effect of these drugs on histamine-stimulated but apparently not on dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated acid secretion. The data indicate that nonsalicylate nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs interacted at a postreceptor site between adenylate cyclase and the proton pump. The potentiating effects of these drugs were regulated by calcium and possibly modulated by prostanoids.\r"

Significant improvement (P less than 0.002) of both the clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy and the electroencephalographic abnormalities was observed after administration of the benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists: comatose rats with no spontaneous righting reflex regained consciousness immediately after injection of the drug. Only slight improvement in clinical hepatic encephalopathy grade was seen after administration of 25 mg/kg of flumazenil. The present data strongly support a role of increased gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone in the pathogenesis of acute hepatic encephalopathy and provide a rationale for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists to restore consciousness in hepatic encephalopathy in humans in the near future.\r"

Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy was shown to be a reproducible test. The maximum mean gallbladder ejection fraction occurred 15 minutes after cholecystokinin infusion and was 74.5% +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM). A gallbladder ejection fraction greater than 40% (mean -3SD) was arbitrarily defined to be normal. The gallbladder ejection fraction test was then used to identify patients with acalculous biliary symptoms who may respond to cholecystectomy. A total of 103 patients was tested; 21 had abnormal gallbladder ejection fractions and were randomized into two groups, cholecystectomy or no operation. These patients were followed up symptomatically at 3-month intervals for 13-54 months (mean, 34 months). Of the 11 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 10 (91%) lost their symptoms and 1 improved. Of the 10 patients in the group that did not undergo surgery, all continued to be symptomatic, 2 of whom requested cholecystectomy after 13 and 24 months, respectively. Of the 13 gallbladders obtained from surgery, 12 showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis, muscle hypertrophy, and/or narrowed cystic duct. A normal gallbladder ejection fraction was recorded in 82 patients, and further treatment was left to the discretion of their referring clinician. On follow-up, 50 patients were asymptomatic and 10 were symptomatic without specific treatment of the biliary tract; 14 underwent cholecystectomy, 8 of whom were asymptomatic. Pathological abnormalities were recorded in 6 of the removed gallbladders. It is concluded that the gallbladder ejection fraction obtained after a 45-minute infusion of cholecystokinin during cholescintigraphy is a reproducible measure of gallbladder emptying, and that cholecystectomy alleviates the biliary-type pain of patients with a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction.\r"

Serial tomographic scans were performed over a 120-minute period after injection of [2-11C]thymidine together with tritium-labeled thymidine. Within 10 minutes after injection, positron emission tomography scans showed a twofold higher hepatic uptake in regenerating than in nonregenerating livers. Time-activity curves over the liver area indicated that the maximal uptake was followed by a faster decrease of 11C radioactivity in controls than in regenerating animals, so that total 11C activity remaining in the liver at 120 minutes accounted for 68% of maximum in regenerating and only 38% in controls. Tissue distribution studies performed at 120 minutes showed that total 11C radioactivity, expressed in percent injected dose per gram, was six times higher in regenerating livers than in controls (0.62% +/- 0.07% in regenerating livers and 0.10% +/- 0.03% in nonregenerating livers; P less than 0.001) and correlated with 3H radioactivity measured in the nuclear fraction (r = 0.92; P less than 0.001). When the hepatic uptake was expressed in percent of dose per organ, the difference between both groups increased (2.31% +/- 0.23% in regenerating livers and 0.29% +/- 0.02% in nonregenerating livers; P less than 0.001) because of higher weight of regenerating livers than of nonregenerating livers (3.83 +/- 0.11 g in regenerating livers and 2.96 +/- 0.16 g in nonregenerating livers; P less than 0.001). In other organs examined, no difference in 11C radioactivity was found between the two groups of rats.

Portal venous pressure gradient, determined as the difference between transhepatic portal and hepatic vein pressure, increased by a mean of 31.1% +/- 14.5% in 8 (73%) and decreased by a mean of 30.1% +/- 11.7% in 3 (27%) patients, with no statistically significant change overall (P = 0.1). These changes in portal venous pressure gradient occurred despite an improvement in the laboratory and clinical parameters of hepatic function. Deep abdominal sonography with color flow imaging at variceal obliteration showed patent paraumbilical veins in 6 (55%) patients, 3 of whom had decreases in portal venous pressure gradient (29%, 19%, 42.5%) at variceal obliteration. In 5 (45%) patients without patent paraumbilical veins, a statistically significant increase in portal venous pressure gradient between initial endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy and variceal obliteration was noted (P = 0.008). Rebleeding (single episode in all 4 patients, before obliteration in 3 patients) occurred in those with an increase in portal venous pressure gradient; all patients with portal venous pressure gradient decreases were nonbleeders. No correlation between changes in portal venous pressure gradient and time to variceal obliteration, number of sclerotherapy treatments, or rebleeding episodes was observed. Thus, an increase in portal venous pressure gradient was noted in the majority of patients at variceal obliteration. Although the portal venous pressure gradient decrease may be explained by a patent paraumbilical vein, the mechanism of portal venous pressure gradient increase is not clear. It is speculated that this portal venous pressure gradient increase may be caused by an increase in collateral resistance or flow or a combination of both, resulting from obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy.\r"

Experimental iron overload was produced by feeding three groups of rats a chow diet supplemented with 3.0% (wt/wt) carbonyl iron for up to 8 weeks achieving graded increases in hepatic iron concentrations ranging from 1360 to 3170 micrograms/g. At low levels of iron overload, there were no changes in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism or calcium sequestration, whereas at moderate and high degrees of iron loading, both of these parameters were significantly reduced. In contrast, there were significant decreases in microsomal cytochrome P450 levels and microsomal calcium sequestration at all three levels of iron loading. These abnormalities occurred at hepatic iron concentrations at which the authors have previously found evidence of hepatic organelle lipid peroxidation. These alterations in organelle calcium sequestration may impair intracellular calcium homeostasis in the liver and contribute to subsequent cellular injury.\r"

  ".U": "91317430\r", 
  ".W": "Gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog is preceded by an increase in mucin secretion by the gallbladder epithelium, and mucin hypersecretion is believed to promote cholesterol gallstone formation by accelerating the nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Some studies have suggested that gallbladder mucin hypersecretion is mediated by increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis, but other observations are difficult to reconcile with this view. An organ culture technique was used to measure mucin secretion in normal prairie dog gallbladder in response to exogenous prostaglandins and agents that increased or decreased endogenous prostaglandin production. Incubation with indomethacin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis with virtually complete inhibition at 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin. However, indomethacin had no effect on gallbladder mucin secretion at concentrations as high as 10(-5) mol/L, and significant inhibition of mucin secretion was only found at 10(-4) mol/L indomethacin, a concentration that also produced a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release from cultured explants. Incubation of gallbladder explants with the calcium ionophore A23187 significantly stimulated endogenous prostaglandin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, increasing synthesis of prostaglandins E and F to as much as 278% +/- 20% and 335% +/- 21% of basal values, respectively; however, the same concentrations of A23187 did not stimulate mucin secretion. Incubation of gallbladder explants in the presence of exogenous prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin F2a in concentrations as high as 10(-6) mol/L also did not stimulate mucin secretion. Prairie dogs fed a lithogenic 1.2% cholesterol diet showed a significant increase in gallbladder mucin secretion after 1 week (117.5 +/- 10.2% of control, P less than 0.05), and 4 of 5 had formed cholesterol monohydrate crystals after 3 weeks. Long-term treatment with indomethacin, 1.2 mg.kg-1.day-1, failed to inhibit gallbladder mucin hypersecretion (129.2 +/- 10.7% of control after 1 week) or cholesterol monohydrate crystal formation (3/5) in cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. Furthermore, incubation of explants with 10(-5) mol/L indomethacin failed to prevent in vitro mucin hypersecretion in cholesterol-fed animals. These findings suggest that prostaglandins do not regulate gallbladder mucin secretion in the prairie dog, and it is unlikely that increases in gallbladder prostaglandin synthesis are responsible for mediating gallbladder mucin hypersecretion during cholelithiasis in the prairie dog.\r"

The discriminant analysis using these bile acid parameters led to complete separation between intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones in the case of brown pigment stones. In contrast, cholesterol stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts showed the bile acid composition close to those found in the extrahepatic ducts and gallbladder. The above data show that the bacterial infection plays a less important role in the formation and ensuing growth of most intrahepatic brown pigment stones than in extrahepatic stones, and that factors other than or in addition to bacterial infection are involved.\r"

This includes adenomatous hyperplasia, extensive fibrosis, and carcinoma. The first case was also complicated by hepatic abscesses, left hepatic lobar atrophy, gastrobiliary and biliarocutaneous fistulae. The second case features an unusually dilated pancreatic duct containing pancreaticoliths that was found later to consist of hyperplastic bile duct epithelium, presumably carried by worm migration in the biliary tree. Liver sections from both patients showed typical features of hepatic clonorchiasis with the cancer. A knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of clonorchiasis, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, might aid Western physicians in averting this serious sequela through prompt eradication of the helminthic infection and early recognition and treatment of its complications.\r"

  ".W": "Until recently, a variety of studies had suggested that luminal stirring in the jejunum is relatively poor, with unstirred layers of about 600 microns reported for humans and 300-900 microns for animals. Unstirred layers of this magnitude would markedly retard the absorption of all solutes, and diffusion through this layer would be the rate-limiting step in the uptake of all rapidly absorbed compounds. As a result, luminal stirring, rather than epithelial transport, would be the major variable influencing absorption rate. However, recent studies in dogs and humans have shown that the unstirred layer has a maximal apparent thickness of only about 40 microns. This layer is far thinner than what can be achieved in vitro with vigorous stirring with a magnetic bar, suggesting that some unique stirring mechanism, perhaps villous contractions, is responsible for this extraordinarily efficient mixing. A 40-microns unstirred layer would produce only about 1/15 the resistance of the previously reported 600 microns value; with this thinner layer, alterations in either luminal stirring or epithelial function could readily influence the absorption rate of rapidly transported compounds.\r"

No significant difference was seen between the prevalence rate in males (0.9%) and females (0.8%) or between urban (0.7%) and rural dwellers (1.0%). A significant variation of rates (0% to 5.7%) was seen from one region to another. The Gizan population, noted for hyperendemic hepatitis B virus infection, had the highest prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus despite its cultural and socioeconomic similarities to other regions. In some regions of Saudi Arabia the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus among children was 0% despite endemic rates for both hepatitis B virus and hepatitis A virus infections. An inverse relationship between age and antibody to hepatitis C virus positivity was noted, suggesting an early acquisition of infection in the population studied. Although the overall prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus in Saudi children appears low, endemic foci exist where transmission of infection appears to occur early in childhood. The significance of this characteristic for the incidence of chronic sequelae of hepatitis C virus infection needs further evaluation.\r"

This variant is unable to produce HBeAg because of the presence of a novel translational stop codon at the end of the precore region of the genome. By direct sequencing of DNA, generated by the polymerase chain reaction, we have evaluated the association between infection with this variant and the fulminant course of hepatitis B. Eighteen patients with fulminant hepatitis B were studied. Of the 15 cases from whose serum viral DNA could be sequenced, the variant was found in the admission sera of 8 of 9 HBeAg- patients but in none of 6 HBeAg+ patients who had fulminant hepatitis B. Patients harboring the variant progressed more rapidly into hepatic encephalopathy, but those infected with the variant strain alone had a greater likelihood of survival than those infected with the normal strain or a mixture. The mutant strain may emerge spontaneously during fulminant hepatitis as occurs in chronic hepatitis B infection during seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody. Alternately, and perhaps less commonly, patients may be infected with the variant ab initio.\r"

To further investigate local immune responses, we studied the expression of lymphocyte antigens and cell-cell interaction molecules known to be involved in effector-target cell interactions by light and electron microscopy in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. CD8+ lymphocytes were found to be the predominant population of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. In contrast, CD4+ cells constituted a comparably higher proportion of cells and were more numerous than CD8+ cells in chronic autoimmune hepatitis. In both viral and autoimmune hepatitis, a substantial portion of lymphocytes expressed activation antigens such as T11/3 (CD2R) and IL-2-R (CD25). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (CD58), which mediates lymphocyte adhesion and activation and is the natural ligand of the CD2/T11 lymphocyte surface receptor, could be demonstrated on endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Hepatocellular lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 expression in chronic hepatitis showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and had a positive correlation with the degree of inflammatory activity. These results suggest that effector-target interactions between hepatocytes and lymphocytes mediated by the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3/CD2 pathway play a role in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Possible functional consequences of this interaction include enhancement of antigen-specific immune reactions and antigen-independent mechanisms of T cell activation, which may contribute considerably to the degree of inflammatory activity and tissue damage in chronic hepatitis.\r"

To verify this hypothesis, we evaluated intrarenal sodium handling by lithium clearance in 51 nonazotemic ascitic cirrhotic patients and in 23 controls who were maintained on the same low-sodium diet (80 mmol/day). Seven of 51 cirrhotic patients underwent spontaneous diuresis, whereas 44 required diuretic treatment. Treatment was started with spironolactone at a dose of 150 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 300 mg and then to 500 mg once daily if no response ensued. Cirrhotic patients who did not experience ascites mobilization with 500 mg spironolactone were then treated with a combined diuretic regimen that included spironolactone at a fixed dose (500 mg once daily) and furosemide at an initial dose of 50 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 100, 150 and 200 mg once daily if no response was noticed. Response to diuretic treatment was defined as body weight loss greater than 700 gm every 3 days until ascites became clinically undetectable. Nonresponders (43%) to spironolactone showed lower sodium fractional excretion (0.34% +/- 0.28% vs. 0.80% +/- 0.50%; p less than 0.001) because of a lower fractional sodium delivery to the distal tubule (18.2% +/- 5.8% vs. 23.4% +/- 7.2%; p less than 0.025) than responders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 23 cirrhotic patients, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined in an artery, the azygos vein, the right renal vein and a hepatic vein before and after an oral 80-mg dose of propranolol. Baseline azygos and renal venous norepinephrine levels were significantly higher than arterial norepinephrine levels (+20%, p less than 0.005; and +28%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Hepatic venous norepinephrine and all venous epinephrine values were below the arterial values (all p less than 0.05). After propranolol intake, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine increased (+16%, p less than 0.01; and +93%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Significant increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine were found in azygos and renal veins (all p less than 0.01), whereas hepatic venous norepinephrine and epinephrine remained unchanged. Azygos and hepatic blood flow decreased after propranolol intake (-27%, p less than 0.05; and -16%, p less than 0.01, respectively). Azygos spillover of norepinephrine (an estimate of locally released norepinephrine delivered to the circulation) and clearance of epinephrine remained unaltered. Hepatointestinal clearance showed no significant change for norepinephrine, but showed a borderline-significant decrease for epinephrine (-23%, p = 0.08). Our results show a net production of norepinephrine in the prehepatic splanchnic area drained through superior portalsystemic collaterals and in the kidneys. The increase in circulating catecholamines after propranolol intake is probably due to a combination of further enhancement of sympathetic activity and a decrease in catecholamine degradation.\r"

The relative mobility of the protein reactive with fibronectin receptor antibody was nearly identical to that of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor, confirming that fibronectin receptor is present in human serum. Serum levels of the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor were analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with various liver diseases. The serum level of fibronectin receptor (micrograms/ml) was significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis (inactive, 2.59 +/- 0.04; active, 3.45 +/- 0.13), cirrhosis (4.77 +/- 0.30), alcoholic liver disease (2.96 +/- 0.16) and hepatocellular carcinoma (4.71 +/- 0.49) than in normal subjects (2.11 +/- 0.08). Strong positive correlation was observed between serum levels of fibronectin receptor and histological findings, particularly in the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Immunohistochemical studies with fibronectin receptor antibody revealed that the beta-subunit of fibronectin receptor was present on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells in the normal liver and was increased in fibrotic areas and on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells of fibrotic liver. The serum level of fibronectin receptor in patients with chronic liver diseases may therefore be a useful marker of hepatic fibrosis.\r"

Total heparin usage was significantly decreased by antithrombin III supplementation (median 5,200 U; range = 2,000 to 13,000) as compared with the control group (median 10,200 U; range = 5,000 to 16,500; p less than 0.005). Blood heparin level (antifactor Xa activity) after the initial bolus was significantly greater in the antithrombin III-supplemented subjects (0.40 +/- 0.07 U/ml compared with 0.22 +/- 0.05 U/ml in the control group; p less than 0.05). The significant reduction in platelet count observed in the control patients (18% +/- 6% at 1 hr; p less than 0.05) did not occur in antithrombin III patients (6% +/- 4% at 1 hr), which was reflected by a lower release of the platelet-specific protein beta-thromboglobulin. Two of 12 patients in both groups showed minor bleeding around vascular access sites during the first hemodialysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical, biochemical and radiographic assessment and bone mineral density measurements of the lumbar spine were carried out in two groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis; group 2 consisted of 18 patients with newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis. Only one patient had bone pain. All patients were normocalcemic; two had elevated serum parathormone levels. Fourteen patients (47%) from group 1 but no patients from group 2 had low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Mean bone mineral density was significantly reduced in group 1 patients (0.97 +/- 0.04 gm/cm2) compared with age-matched and sex-matched controls (1.25 +/- 0.01 gm/cm2, p less than 0.0001), and in 15 patients (50%) bone mineral density was below the fracture threshold (0.98 gm/cm2). The bone mineral density in group 2 was not significantly different from controls, and no patient was below the fracture threshold. In neither group did bone mineral density correlate with serum bilirubin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fecal fat excretion, previous drug therapy or the presence of chronic ulcerative colitis. Histomorphometrical examination of bone from four group 1 patients showed increased bone resorption, reduced bone formation, moderate-to-severe osteopenia and no osteomalacia. In conclusion, severe osteopenic bone disease is common in advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis and, like that seen in other cholestatis diseases, is consistent with osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "A multivariate analysis of data from 90 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was performed using Cox's regression model to identify factors possibly affecting their prognoses. Thirty-one patients underwent arterial anticancer chemotherapy, and the remaining 59 patients received transcatheter arterial embolization with anticancer agents. Four of 27 variables tested for all the patients (i.e., encapsulation [p less than 0.05], gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma [p less than 0.01], clinical stage [p less than 0.01] and therapy [p less than 0.01]) were found to be prognostically significant. Five of 27 variables tested were prognostically significant for the transcatheter arterial embolization group; they were an extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (p less than 0.01), encapsulation (p less than 0.01), alpha-fetoprotein (p less than 0.01), prothrombin time (p less than 0.01) and serum sodium (p less than 0.01). Regression equations were used to describe a prognostic index. A prognostic index was defined as the regression equation derived from the results of a total of 90 patients; PI-1 = eY, where PI-1 = prognostic index 1 Y = 1.549 (gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.344) + 0.778 (encapsulation - 1.622) + 0.818 (clinical stage - 1.800) + 1.760 (therapy - 1.344) and prognostic index 2, the regression equation derived from the results of the transcatheter arterial embolization group of patients; PI-2 = eY, where PI-2 = prognostic index 2 Y = 1.210 (extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.576) + 1.179 (encapsulation - 1.475) + 0.0001277 (alpha-fetoprotein - 1420.792) -0.039 (prothrombin time - 72.237) - 0.214 (serum sodium - 138.427).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two polyclonal antibodies that were produced in rabbits were directed against the amino terminal of transforming growth factor-beta 1. Staining by anti-CC(1-30) was primarily extracellular and located in the portal and periportal fibrotic areas of all seven cases with chronic active hepatitis. No staining was noted in the four chronic persistent cases studied. A strong reaction was seen with the antibody in nine of the ten cirrhotic samples, whereas it was negative in one inactive cirrhosis case and in all five cases with normal liver histological findings. No positive staining could be detected by the anti-LC(1-30) in any of the liver tissues. Detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in active liver diseases at the site of fibrosis suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might have a role in the process and progression of fibrosis during the development of the disease.\r"

In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection.\r"

Binding of 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell surface receptors was specific, saturable and calcium-independent. Both cell lines exhibited a single class of high-affinity (Kd = 2.2 x 10(-10) mol/L) binding sites (4.5 x 10(3) for the Hep G2 cell; 1.5 x 10(3) for the Hep 3B cell) for both human and porcine transforming growth factor-beta 1. Binding was temperature dependent, time dependent and pH dependent. Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was removed by brief exposure to acidic medium (pH less than 4) but was converted into an acid-resistant state rapidly after shifting the cells to 37 degrees C. Spontaneous dissociation of bound ligand over a 6 hr period at 4 degrees C was less than 10%. Disuccinimidyl suberate was used to covalently label 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell-surface binding sites. Labeling of the ligand/receptor complexes was inhibited by unlabeled transforming growth factor-beta 1 but was unaffected by other growth factors. The radiolabeled complexes showed approximate molecular weights of 280,000, 85,000 and 65,000 when run on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was internalized and degraded at 37 degrees C, and the products were released into the medium as trichloroacetic acid-nonprecipitable radioactivity. The lysosomotropic base chloroquine and the carboxylic ionphore monensin inhibited degradation and release of 125I-labeled products from the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean (+/- S.D.) bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in 210 ambulatory women with primary biliary cirrhosis was 1.02 +/- 0.19 gm/cm2, 7% lower than that in 139 age-matched normal women (after adjustment for age and body weight) (p less than 0.001). Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was inversely related to a risk score index of liver disease severity (r = -0.29, p less than 0.001). The mean rate of bone loss in 105 of these 210 women was 2%/yr +/- 4%/yr, twice as great as in the 139 normal women (p less than 0.02). In 20 women with primary biliary cirrhosis followed up after orthotopic liver transplantation, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine decreased at 3 mo (p less than 0.01), and this decrease may have resulted in atraumatic fractures in 13 of them. Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine then increased (p less than 0.01) so that by 12 mo the median bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was similar to that before transplantation and by 24 mo it was 5% above it. Therefore we conclude that the progressive bone loss observed in primary biliary cirrhosis (which is further accentuated immediately after transplantation) may be halted, and the bone mass may be restored toward normal within 2 to 3 yr after orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

Wolf) lithotripter. Since each stone triplet was obtained from the same gallbladder, the concrements of one such set were identical in physicochemical parameters. According to the maximal diameter, the calculi were divided into group A (6 to 15 mm) and group B (16 to 30 mm). Shockwave application was terminated when residual fragments measured 4 mm or less. Forty-five triplets were fragmented at energy settings mainly used in clinical treatment of patients with gallbladder stones (MPL 9000: 20 kV; Lithostar Plus: setting 9 (maximal); Piezolith 2300: setting 3). The fragmentation endpoint was achieved in group A (n = 3 x 36) with the Piezolith 2300 after median 150 (range = 50 to 500) pulses and with the Lithostar Plus after 150 (50 to 750) pulses compared with 500 (50 to 1,500) pulses using the MPL 9000 (p less than 0.01).

In this study, we characterized changes in sulfated proteoglycan production by hepatic macrophages following in vivo activation with lipopolysaccharide. We found that both resident Kupffer cells and liver macrophages from lipopolysaccharide-treated rats incorporated [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans. Lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages incorporated two to three times more of the label than did resident Kupffer cells. In addition, although both cell types produced chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, resident Kupffer cells synthesized more chondroitin sulfate whereas lipopolysaccharide-activated cells produced more heparan sulfate. Using specific antibodies and flow cytometry, we also found that hepatic macrophages produced chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate and chondroitin-O-sulfate. Lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages contained more chondroitin-4-sulfate and chondroitin-O-sulfate and less heparan sulfate than did resident Kupffer cells. Both tunicamycin and beta-D-xylosides, inhibitors of sulfated proteoglycan biosynthesis, were found to block phagocytosis by the cells. Taken together, these results suggest that sulfated proteoglycans are important in activation and functional responsiveness of liver macrophages.\r"

We have tested the hypothesis of hematogenous infection of the biliary system in cats. The animals were treated in three different groups: group A (no biliary obstruction), group B (acute biliary obstruction) and group C (chronic biliary obstruction). A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was infused into the splenic vein of cats at three different dosages (10(7), 10(5) and 10(3) with sham controls. In the unobstructed biliary system, the mutant E. coli was isolated from the bile 30 min and 90 min after the infusion of 10(7) and 10(5) E. coli, respectively. No bacteria were found in the bile with the infusion of 10(3) E. coli and in the control animals. Bile flow was significantly reduced with the infusion of bacteria. The biliary excretion of E. coli in group B was similar to that in group A. In group C, the bile output in the first hour was very high but declined rapidly. E. coli was excreted into the bile at all three dosages of infusion after 30 min. Histological sections of the liver showed that the infused bacteria entered the sinusoidal blood and that some were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. The portal-venous blood was considered an important route of bacterial invasion into the biliary system, and the penetration of bacteria was facilitated in biliary obstruction.\r"

The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, we have conducted a systematic investigation of various aspects of cell viability and function of isolated hepatocytes stored at 4 degrees C for 24 and 48 hr in either University of Wisconsin solution or Hanks' HEPES buffer, a control solution clinically unsuitable for organ preservation. After 24 hr, hepatocytes stored in Hanks' HEPES buffer had viability (measured by trypan blue exclusion and ALT and lactic dehydrogenase leakage), transport function (measured by 22Na+ and [3H]taurocholate uptake) and cell size similar or only slightly altered when compared with freshly isolated and University of Wisconsin solution-stored hepatocytes. ATP content was decreased in both groups; however, the reduction was much greater in Hanks' HEPES buffer-stored cells. Furthermore, ATP regenerating capacity was greatly reduced in Hanks' HEPES buffer- stored but not in University of Wisconsin solution-stored hepatocytes. By 48 hr viability and function of Hanks' HEPES buffer-stored hepatocytes were decreased; University of Wisconsin solution afforded partial protection. When examined by light and electron microscopy, cells stored in both University of Wisconsin solution and Hanks' HEPES buffer for 24 hr appeared essentially normal except for the presence of numerous membrane blebs in the Hanks' HEPES buffer group. Tissue sections of livers preserved in Hanks' HEPES buffer but not in University of Wisconsin solution revealed the presence of extensive amounts of blebs in the sinusoidal lumen and loss of endothelial elements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The viability (oxygen consumption), bile secretion, structural integrity and secretion of nascent lipoproteins by FC-43-perfused rat livers was compared with livers perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer that contained rat erythrocytes (25% hematocrit) and 1.5 mg/ml glucose (red blood cell medium). Oxygen consumption was somewhat higher in livers perfused with FC-43 emulsion. Bile secretion of livers perfused with FC-43 emulsion for 4 hr was reduced significantly to 40% of that by red blood cell medium. The structural integrity of livers perfused with FC-43 emulsion varied from normal to marked cellular damage. Light-microscopical examination of rat livers perfused with FC-43 emulsion showed ballooning of sinusoids, presence of vacuoles in sinusoidal lining cells in some hepatocytes and detachment of endothelium in sinusoids. The number of vacuoles progressively increased in longer perfusions. Electron-microscopical studies showed the presence of small (60 to 100 nm) vesicles of varying electron density, presumably fluorocarbon particles inside the vacuoles in sinusoidal lining cells (Kupffer and endothelial) and hepatocytes. After 4 hr of perfusion with FC-43 emulsion, most of the sinusoidal endothelia were denuded, and the microvilli of the hepatocytes all but disappeared. In contrast, the ultrastructure of rat livers perfused with red blood cell medium for 4 hr was unaltered. The accumulation of nascent lipoproteins in perfusates of FC-43-perfused livers was markedly reduced, and no normal very-low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein were isolated. Chemical analysis showed the presence of Pluronic F-68 in all lipoprotein fractions. Our data strongly suggest that, during recirculating liver perfusions with FC-43 emulsion (between 1 and 4 hr), the nonionic surfactant detergent Pluronic F-68 dissociated from the emulsion and markedly affected hepatic structure, lipoprotein secretion and the composition of lipoproteins isolated from perfusate. Therefore FC-43 emulsion is not a suitable liver-perfusion medium for studies of lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

Serum bile acid levels were increased, bile acid-independent bile flow was decreased and biliary glutathione concentrations were markedly decreased in the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat. Biliary excretion of sulfobromophthalein was markedly impaired and almost no glutathione conjugate was excreted in the bile of the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat. Biliary excretion of lithocholate-3-O-glucuronide and lithocholate-3-sulfate in the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat was markedly delayed, whereas that of lithocholate was only slightly delayed. After [14C]chenodeoxycholate infusion (1 mumol/min/100 gm for 60 min), the increases in bile flow and biliary excretion of isotope in the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat were not so prominent as those observed in control rats, and the glucuronide of chenodeoxycholate, which constituted about 15% of biliary chenodeoxycholate in control rats, was not observed in the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat. Initial uptake of lithocholate and its glucuronide and sulfate by isolated hepatocytes was not impaired in the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat; the profiles of cytosolic bile acid binding proteins in Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat liver were identical to those in control liver. These data indicate that the Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rat has excretory impairment of organic anions, bile acid glucuronide and sulfate and that it has characteristics very similar to those of the hyperbilirubinemic mutant Wistar rats TR- and GY.\r"

From rats given a mixture of [14C] ornithine and [3H]arginine, hepatic collagen and serum albumin were obtained. The hepatocyte contribution was calculated from the 14C and 3H in arginine purified from collagen and albumin by high performance liquid chromatography. The contribution was less than 10% of total collagen production in normal and early fibrotic livers induced by a single dose of carbon tetrachloride or dimethylnitrosamine. We conclude that hepatocytes may play a minor role in collagen production in normal and early fibrotic rat livers.\r"

This stimulator of Kupffer cells is a normal endogenous component of portal venous blood. After partial hepatectomy (6 to 48 hr), when hepatic regeneration rates were greatest, regenerating liver Kupffer cells demonstrated a significantly greater capacity to produce prostaglandin E2 in response to bacterial endotoxin than did equal numbers of Kupffer cells from time-matched, sham-operated control animals. However, by 12 days after partial hepatectomy, when liver mass had been more than 83% restored, regenerating liver Kupffer cell prostaglandin E2 production had decreased to levels produced by sham KC. We postulate that high levels of Kupffer cell-derived prostaglandin E2 provide a critical paracrine signal fundamental to the initiation and control of growth by neighboring hepatocytes during liver regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "In mammalian cells, nucleoside transport usually is mediated by facilitated diffusion. In addition, a Na(+)-dependent, concentrative nucleoside transport system has been detected in several tissues but not the liver. To further clarify hepatic nucleoside transport mechanisms, we measured the uptake of [2-14C]uridine (2 to 100 mumol/L) and of [8-14C]adenosine (10 to 75 mumol/L) by the isolated perfused rat liver in the presence or absence of extracellular sodium or specific inhibitors of facilitated nucleoside diffusion. Uridine transport and metabolism were monitored by the release of labeled catabolites including 14CO2, which indicated complete degradation of the pyrimidine. Adenosine, uridine and uridine catabolites were measured in the effluent perfusate by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and a radioactivity flow monitor. The existence of a Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system could be inferred from the following observations: (a) Sodium depletion caused a strong inhibition of nucleoside transport reflected by an up to threefold and 15-fold increase in extracellular uridine and adenosine, respectively. The sodium-dependent transport of uridine was saturated when the influent uridine concentration was raised beyond 20 mumol/L. No such saturation was observed for much higher concentrations of adenosine used (10 to 75 mumol/L). (b) Na(+)-free perfusion resulted in a strong suppression of the release of uridine catabolites by the liver. Complete uridine breakdown was depressed to 7% of the amount of 14CO2 released in the presence of sodium and at influent uridine concentrations below 20 mumol/L. (c) Inhibition of uridine (10 mumol/L) transport and degradation was observed after coperfusion with adenosine, deoxyadenosine, guanosine and deoxyguanosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neonates with DBH deficiency have had episodic hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension, but survivors sometimes cope relatively well until late childhood when overwhelming orthostatic hypotension profoundly limits their activities. The hypotension may be so severe that clonic seizures supervene. Most currently recognized patients are young or middle-aged adults. The diagnosis is established by the observation of severe orthostatic hypotension in a patient whose plasma norepinephrine/dopamine ratio is much less than one.\r"

Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated. Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls. At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats. At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes. Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group). In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26). The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36). These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure.\r"

To determine whether altered cell calcium metabolism precedes the development of overt hypertension, we measured [Ca2+]i under resting and stimulated conditions in blood platelets and thymic lymphocytes isolated from 4-week-old prehypertensive SHR and WKY rats. Blood pressure was similar in both groups (SHR 95 +/- 8 versus WKY rats 92 +/- 7 mm Hg). Basal [Ca2+]i in platelets was higher in SHR than WKY rats (63.4 +/- 3.9 versus 54.8 +/- 3.1 nM, p less than 0.003). Also the [Ca2+]i response to thrombin was greater in SHR than WKY rats in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. For lymphocytes, although no difference was detected in basal [Ca2+]i, the concanavalin A-induced peak [Ca2+]i was higher for SHR than WKY rats in both calcium-containing and calcium-free media. These results suggest that agonist-stimulated calcium influx and calcium discharge from intracellular stores are enhanced in both platelets and lymphocytes of 4-week-old SHR. We conclude that abnormalities in calcium metabolism in two different cell types precede the development of overt hypertension in the SHR.\r"

Twelve control animals were given regular tap water. Systolic blood pressure in the ethanol-treated rats was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that in controls after 1 week and remained higher throughout the study. At 13 weeks of age, platelet cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake by aortas were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in ethanol-treated animals as compared with those in controls. Ethanol intake did not affect aortic ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake. The in vitro effect of ethanol on calcium-45 and 86Rb uptake was also investigated in aortas of untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats at 13 weeks of age. In vitro ethanol (2.5-20 mmols/l) did not significantly affect 45Ca and 86Rb uptake in rat aortas. The increases in systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, and vascular calcium uptake suggest that increases in cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake mechanisms are associated with ethanol-induced hypertension.\r"

Obtained DNA fingerprints revealed that, in both the stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat, there is a substantial genetic difference between the rats from the National Institutes of health and from Shimane Institute of Health Science. By contrast, only a small genetic difference was observed either between the rats from the National Institutes of Health and Charles River Laboratories or among the substrains of the spontaneously hypertensive rat in the Shimane Institute of Health Science. Further, in the strains from the Shimane Institute of Health Science, there were fingerprinting bands that could distinguish either the Wistar-Kyoto rat from all the substrains of the spontaneously hypertensive rat or the stroke-prone from the stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat in spite of their close genetic backgrounds. From the observations above, we concluded 1) that there is substantial genetic variance of the spontaneously hypertensive rat between the two major sources in the world, the National Institutes of Health and the Shimane Institute of Health Science and 2) that by DNA fingerprinting analysis, it is possible to identify the restriction fragment length polymorphisms that are specific for the spontaneously hypertensive rat or the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat.

The peptidic Ang II antagonist saralasin lowered arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal decrease in pressure was similar to that observed after the Ang II infusion was discontinued. The nonpeptide Ang II antagonist, 4'-[( 2-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-imidazole-1-yl] methyl) [1,1'-biphenyl] -2-carboxylic acid (SC-48742), lowered acutely elevated arterial pressure to a level similar to that on discontinuation of the angiotensin infusion. Chronic (8 days) infusion of Ang II (20 ng/kg/min i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure from 116 +/- 3 to 164 +/- 7 mm Hg, which then decreased to 121 +/- 6 mm Hg on termination of the infusion. Saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min, a maximally effective dose during acute angiotensin infusion) decreased mean arterial pressure from 168 +/- 7 to 141 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was discontinued. SC-48742 decreased mean arterial pressure from 167 +/- 7 to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure not statistically different from the minimum pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was terminated. The mechanism of blood pressure elevation during acute high dose or chronic low dose Ang II infusion is different, the latter having a significant neural component as measured by the response to trimethaphan. The peptidic antagonist saralasin was fully effective in lowering acute angiotensin hypertension but only partially effective during chronic hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of angiotensin peptides to stimulate prostaglandin release and raise intracellular calcium levels by activating a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C was assessed in three human astrocytoma cell lines (CRTG3, STTG1, and WITG2). The addition of angiotensin II to CRTG3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin, the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Angiotensin-(1-7), previously considered to be an inactive metabolite of angiotensin II, was as potent as angiotensin II for prostaglandin release but did not activate phospholipase C or mobilize intracellular calcium. In contrast, angiotensin-(2-8) caused only a slight increase in prostaglandin release, even though it was as effective as angiotensin II in augmenting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization. Moreover, neither the release of prostaglandins in response to angiotensin II or angiotensin-(1-7) nor the mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II required extracellular calcium. Angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) caused the release of prostaglandins from all three human astrocytoma cell lines, but changes in the level of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II only occurred in CRTG3 cells. Although previous studies have provided evidence for angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of selectivity of antagonists or signal transduction mechanisms, these data suggest that human astrocytes contain multiple angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of their response to different angiotensin heptapeptides--angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(2-8).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lesion of the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle causes hypernatremia, adipsia, and attenuation of the pressor response to intravenous administration of angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In addition, these lesions prevent the development of several experimental models of hypertension. In this study, a lesion of the third cerebral ventricle region was made in 14 dogs. In seven dogs in which hypernatremia developed the lesions included the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis; seven animals in which the circumventricular organ was spared by the lesion remained normonatremic. Vascular responsiveness of isolated right carotid artery rings to angiotensin II and phenylephrine was assessed 3 days after lesioning the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle. In endothelium-denuded ring vessels, vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine were significantly decreased in animals both with and without inclusion of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. A similar effect was observed in intact vessels of dogs in which the circumventricular organ was spared but not in those with lesions that included this area. In contrast, angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction was significantly decreased in the arteries with intact endothelium of both groups of lesioned animals. These data show that lesion of the anteroventral third ventricle area alters alpha 1-adrenergic and angiotensin II vascular responsiveness in isolated carotid artery rings with the possible participation of the endothelium.\r"

Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded and plasma catecholamines were measured in conscious rats receiving microinfusions of either artificial cerebrospinal fluid or a gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist, bicuculline methiodide, bilaterally into the paraventricular nucleus. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid had no effect on any of the recorded variables. In contrast, infusion of bicuculline into the region of the paraventricular nucleus produced increases in blood pressure (20 +/- 2 mm Hg), heart rate (110 +/- 11 beats/min), and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (640 +/- 107 pg/ml) and epinephrine (1,266 +/- 267 pg/ml). Pretreatment with a ganglionic blocking agent abolished both the blood pressure (-1 +/- 2 mm Hg) and heart rate (5 +/- 18 beats/min) effects. Bilateral adrenal medullectomy reduced the changes in plasma norepinephrine concentrations (81 +/- 14 pg/ml) significantly and abolished the changes in plasma epinephrine concentrations (5 +/- 4 pg/ml). Conversely, adrenal medullectomy reduced the pressor effects (18 +/- 2 mm Hg) only slightly while the heart rate responses were attenuated (42 +/- 9 beats/min) by approximately 50%. These results suggest that an endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid system exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on the sympathetic nervous system at the level of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".U": "91317538\r", 
  ".W": "Regional spillover of norepinephrine (NE), based on isotope dilution and single-compartment steady-state kinetics, is considered one of the best parameters for estimating organ sympathetic activity. However, the effects of local changes in clearance of NE on the spillover have not yet been investigated. We studied local NE kinetics and clearance in the forearm of 10 healthy subjects using intra-arterial infusions of NE, tritiated NE, the neuronal uptake inhibitor desipramine, and tyramine, which competes with NE for the neuronal uptake carrier. Before and during complete blockade of neuronal uptake by desipramine the venous concentration-time curves for tritiated NE and for NE released by tyramine were biexponential, consistent with the presence of (at least) two compartments for circulating tritiated NE and for locally released NE. The time constants for tyramine-induced release of NE and, in the same subjects during desipramine infusion, for tritiated NE were almost equal at the same level of forearm blood flow. This argues against possible diffusion or transport differences for NE to and from the circulation and the synapse. The regional intrinsic clearance capacity (a measure of the maximal ability of an organ to irreversibly remove drug by all pathways in the absence of any flow limitations) for NE decreased in the forearm by 65% (p less than 0.01) during neuronal uptake blockade by desipramine; the forearm clearance decreased by 59% (p less than 0.001), whereas the spillover rate of NE increased from 33 +/- 5 to 63 +/- 11 pmol.min-1 (p less than 0.05). Nitroprusside-induced increments in blood flow increased the spillover of NE from 18 +/- 4 to 35 +/- 6 pmol.min-1 (p less than 0.01); the clearance of circulating NE also increased (by 58%, p less than 0.05), and the intrinsic clearance capacity remained unchanged. This demonstrates that regional spillover of NE is markedly influenced by local changes in clearance and flow. The new parameter plasma appearance rate of NE is proposed. Although also derived from isotope dilution, this parameter may better approximate the regional entry of NE into the blood pool than spillover. This is corroborated by the nonsignificant changes of plasma appearance rate of NE during our desipramine and nitroprusside infusions.\r"

We studied the reproducibility of a rapid method for assessing sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure as well as the effect of age on this phenomenon. Blood pressure after volume expansion with 2 l intravenous saline (0.9%) over 4 hours was compared with that after 1 day of 10 mmol sodium chloride intake and 3 and 40 mg oral doses of furosemide. Normal and hypertensive subjects (n = 28) were studied twice within a year. Cross-sectional observations of the effect of age were made from studies in 230 hypertensive and 430 normotensive subjects. Longitudinal observations of blood pressure change over time were made 10 or more years after categorization of sodium responsivity in 31 subjects. The blood pressure response was reproducible in 28 subjects studied twice (r = 0.56, p less than 0.002). Four subjects changed salt-responsiveness status and six were indeterminate on restudy. Sodium sensitivity of blood pressure increased significantly with increasing age in the entire population (n = 660, r = -0.38, p less than 0.001). The relation was more striking in hypertensive subjects (n = 230, r = -0.31, p less than 0.001) in whom a progressive increase in salt sensitivity with decades was seen than in the normotensive group (n = 430, r = -0.19, p less than 0.01) in whom salt sensitivity was not observed until the sixth decade. Salt-sensitive subjects had a significantly greater increase in systolic (p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.01) pressure over time than those who were salt-resistant. Salt sensitivity is a reproducible phenomenon that is related to the age-associated increase in blood pressure characteristic of industrialized societies. In addition, salt sensitivity can be shown to be a predictor of subsequent, age-related blood pressure increase.\r"

Since past studies have usually based hypertension on a single blood pressure assessment or have often included treated hypertensive patients, this inconsistency is not surprising. The current study compared the prevalence of Type A behavior (assessed by Rosenman's structured interview) between 109 untreated hypertensive subjects and 109 age-, sex-, ethnic-, and occupation-matched normotensive subjects. Hypertension status was based on five repeated assessments over a 5-month period. Results indicated that Type A behavior is more prevalent in untreated, mildly hypertensive employed individuals than occupationally matched normotensive subjects. Type A component analysis confirmed the importance of hostility and certain vigorous voice stylistics in predicting cardiovascular conditions. These findings, taken together with the evidence linking Type A behavior with high cholesterol and cigarette smoking, further support the view that this behavior pattern is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "In severe preeclampsia, short-term peripartum management of hypertension with hydralazine is complicated by relatively prolonged hypotensive episodes, resulting in fetal distress. We hypothesized that nitroprusside's rapid onset and brief antihypertensive action would permit more controlled blood pressure reduction. Nitroprusside was infused into 10 invasively monitored subjects until mean arterial pressure either 1) was gradually reduced 10-20% or 2) fell abruptly. Subjects fell into two groups, defined by whether the hypotensive effect of nitroprusside was accompanied by a fall in heart rate (group A, n = 8) or a rise (group B, n = 2). Group B showed the expected sinoaortic baroreceptor reflex elevations in heart rate (+17 +/- 6 beats/min) in response to moderate falls in mean arterial pressure (-32 +/- 9 mm Hg) elicited by moderate doses (1.03 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min). However in group A, steep reductions in mean arterial pressure (-75 +/- 22 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), significantly greater than in group B (p less than 0.05), occurred at much lower doses (0.35 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.05) and were accompanied by falls in heart rate (-21 +/- 7 beats/min). The apparently paradoxical falls in heart rate and extreme hypotensive responses in group A indicate severe circulatory compromise, corresponding to the cardiac and vasomotor depression that characterizes severe hemorrhage and other forms of acute/severe hypovolemic hypotension. This hemodynamic pattern represents a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex presumably related to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The appearance of this pattern in the present study probably reflects the imposition of nitroprusside's prominent venous dilator action on the relatively reduced blood volume that generally characterizes severe preeclampsia.\r"

The effects of chronic administration of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a specific irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase and thus polyamine biosynthesis, on vascular polyamine contents, structure, and function as well as the development of hypertension was studied. Control and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats received either tap water or a drinking solution containing alpha-difluoromethylornithine for 6 weeks, during which period systolic blood pressures were recorded. Vascular reactivity studies were performed on rings of aorta and tail artery. Medial thickness, vessel weight, and vascular polyamine contents were also assessed in these arteries. alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment had no significant effect on either systolic blood pressure or vascular structure, function, and polyamine contents of control animals. The elevation in blood pressure and the increase in medial thickness, ring weight, and vascular polyamine contents as well as altered vascular reactivity observed in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats was significantly attenuated by alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment. These results are the first to demonstrate that vascular polyamine contents are elevated in the deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rat and that chronic alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment prevents the rise in vascular polyamines as well as the elevation in blood pressure and attendant changes in the vasculature. Thus, the increase in vascular polyamines may comprise a critical link between the initiating stimuli and the alterations in vascular structure and function implicated in the pathogenesis of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension.\r"

The gene frequencies in DS rats were s = 0.690, r = 0.284, and z = 0.026.

We also measured concentrations of this peptide in another model of malignant hypertension, the two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats chronically given caffeine. Plasma irET-1 concentrations in young (6-week-old) and mature (18-week-old) SHR did not differ from those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Four weeks of treatment with DOCA-salt increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and plasma irET-1 in SHR but not in WKY rats. Eight weeks of DOCA-salt treatment further increased these values in SHR. Plasma irET-1 concentrations were not increased in the 2K1C rats. Six weeks of caffeine administration increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, and plasma irET-1 in the 2K1C rats but not in the sham-operated rats. High-performance liquid chromatographic profiles of plasma extracts pooled from these rats with malignant hypertension showed that a major component of irET-1 eluted in the position of synthetic ET-1 (1-21). Furthermore, acute hypertension induced by angiotensin II or phenylephrine did not affect the plasma irET-1 concentration in rats. The results suggested that the plasma ET-1 concentration is increased in rat models of malignant hypertension and that the high blood pressure itself is not the main factor involved in the increase of plasma ET-1.\r"

Oral Mg was then supplemented in an open design for the next two months. At the 2nd month, the Pain Total Index was decreased by both Placebo and Mg, with patients receiving active drug showing the lowest values (P less than 0.03). The number of days with headache was reduced only in the patients on active drug. Mg treatment also improved premenstrual complaints, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) scores. The reduction of PTI and MDQ scores was observed also at the 4th month of treatment, when Mg was supplemented in all the patients. Intracellular Mg++ levels in patients with menstrual migraine were reduced compared to controls. During oral Mg treatment, the Mg++ content of Lymphocytes (LC) and Polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) significantly increased, while no changes in plasma or Red Blood Cells were found. An inverse correlation between PTI and Mg++ content in PMN was demonstrated. These data point to magnesium supplementation as a further means for menstrual migraine prophylaxis, and support the possibility that a lower migraine threshold could be related to magnesium deficiency.\r"

Considerable criticism against our contention has been raised by Swerdlow and Dieter (Headache 29:562-568, 1989, ref. 1), who claim that the cold patch constitutes a \"fixed geography\" of the vasculature of migraine patients. In the present paper we replicate and extend our previous findings reporting the results of facial thermography in a sample of 246 consecutive migraine patients. Of these the 206 exhibiting a typical cold patch or a significant asymmetry in the forehead thermal dissipation were admitted to prophylactic treatment (beta blocker or calcium channel blocker). The thermography was performed at entry in the study and after six months of active treatment. The clinical outcome was compared to the thermographic findings. The patients were subdivided in three classes on the basis of the clinical outcome. Among the 136 patients who experienced complete or substantial relief from headache the cold patch disappeared or markedly improved in 85% of the cases. In the 46 patients with partial relief the thermogram showed an improved pattern in 48% of cases, most of the time of smaller extent than in the previous class. In 24 patients we observed no clinical improvement. Among these the thermogram remained unchanged in 85% of cases. Taken together these findings corroborate our previous suggestion that thermography is useful to monitor the clinical course of the disease. One additional suggestion from the present data is that thermography closely parallels the clinical course so as to represent a useful criterion for the decision of discontinuing the therapy.\r"

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a polypeptide secreted by antigen or mitogen-actuated T lymphocytes that functions as a growth factor for T cells. To investigate cellular immune functions in patients with chronic headache, we measured the IL-2 concentration of sera in patients with migraine and in patients with tension-type headache. Thirteen subjects suffering from migraine without aura (5 males and 8 females, mean age: 32.8 years) and 46 subjects (20 males and 26 females, mean age: 39.7 years) with tension-type headache (TH) were selected for this study. Forty-three normal healthy volunteers composed the control group (15 males and 28 females, average age 41.6 years). The IL-2 levels of sera were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. The IL-2 levels of sera were 3.18 +/- 1.8 U/ml (mean +/- SD) in the healthy controls, 2.29 +/- 2.6 U/ml in the patients with migraine and 1.59 +/- 1.0 U/ml in the patients with TH. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with migraine was significantly lower than in the controls. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with TH was significantly lower than in the controls. The central nervous system (CNS) has been considered to be involved in the development of the immune phenomena. In the patients with TH or migraine, reduction in platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and sympathetic hypofunction have been observed. These phenomena might reflect decrease in 5-HT levels in CNS in the patients with TH or migraine. The decreased serum IL-2 level, observed in this study, might reflect a reduction in 5-HT or catecholamine levels in CNS in the patients with migraine or TH.\r"

  ".W": "Several clinical and circulatory physiological observations indicate that the internal carotid artery (ICA) with proximal pial and orbital-periorbital branches, as well as external carotid vessels adjacent to the orbital region, are involved in the autonomic symptoms of an attack of cluster headache. Evidence is presented here that an activation of pain fibers innervating the intracranial segment of ICA may cause not only the retroorbital pain of an attack but also, via the mechanical effect of a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel wall, the local symptoms of a sympathetic defect and, via a reflex are to the parasympathetic pathway along the greater superficial petrosal nerve, the local symptoms from glands and vessels of parasympathetic discharge. Dilation of the intracranial ICA due to activation of this parasympathetic pathway may aggravate pain. Possible mechanisms behind such a local pain fiber activation are discussed.\r"

Measurements in patients were made before and after biofeedback therapy. All EMG levels were on average significantly higher in patients than in controls. 62.5% of patients had at least one abnormal EMG level, but only 34% were beyond the normal range, if 1 muscle and 1 recording condition was considered. EMG levels were not correlated with headache severity, anxiety or response to biofeedback treatment. It is therefore suggested that pericranial EMG activity is not pathogenetic in chronic tension type headache, but merely one of several pathophysiologic changes, that are produced by a central dysfunction.\r"

In both samples symptom combinations corresponding to the syndromes of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and tension headache did indeed occur with significant frequency. The same clear-cut symptom patterns appeared when patients with preceding visual disturbances were excluded from analysis. These results seem to lend strong support to a categorical model of headache, rather than to the concept of headache as a spectrum.\r"

Subjects completed various self-report measures and monitored headache activity four times per day over a 4-week period. Analyses revealed that smokers experienced greater weekly peak headache intensity, and reported higher levels of depression and general physical symptoms. Among smokers, nicotine content of the preferred brand was associated with mean headache index and weekly headache-free days, as well as depression and anxiety scores. Daily smoking rate and pack-year history were related to level of general physical symptoms only. Thus, both smoking status and the nicotine content of the preferred cigarette appear to adversely impact headache activity. Further, smokers who are more anxious or depressed may increase their headache activity via their preference for higher nicotine-content cigarettes. These results are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying these effects, and implications for the clinical management of headache suffers who smoke.\r"

The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol.\r"

The extent of each subsequent excision was recorded until tumor-free tissue was reached. The results showed that BCCs have a highly irregular infiltration pattern and a predilection for small, fingerlike outgrowths whose bases occupy 1-30 degrees of the tumor circumference. When superficial extension was expressed mathematically, the resulting exponential functions varied highly significantly (P = .001) according to histologic tumor type and diameter. The resulting curves permitted very precise prediction of the probability of tumor-positive margins (ie, subtotal excision), depending on the safety margin, histologic tumor type, and tumor diameter. For example, the probability of tumor-positive margins after excision of a BCC up to 10 mm in diameter is 30% with a safety margin of 2 mm, 16% with a safety margin of 3 mm, and 5% with a safety margin of 5 mm. The probability of tumor-positive margins for fibrosing primary BCCs 10-20 mm in diameter is 48, 34, and 18% with safety margins of 2, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Recurrent tumors have a significantly higher probability of positive margins (P = .001) than primary ones. Anatomic location and tumor age affect subclinical extension only indirectly.\r"

Patients frequently failed to recognize infection and signs of inflammation. When asked if wound infection was present, patients' false positive diagnostic rate was only 8%, but the false negative diagnostic rate was 48%. Medical examiners diagnosed wound infection in 21 wounds, and patients correctly identified their infections in only 11 of these cases. These results indicate that for the population studied, patients cannot be expected to recognize infection in their own wounds using verbal or printed instructions. Clinical investigators of wound healing should not use patient-reported data about wound infection that is obtained by telephone interview or other means.\r"

Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries. Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated. Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function.\r"

These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory.\r"

Five of 10 dogs were negative for proliferative responses to BpA in node cells from infected limbs, yet they had positive PBL responses, and another was negative in both node cells and PBL. Production of BpA-specific antibody was detected in cultures of node cells from infected limbs of 9 of 10 dogs, but only in two cultures of node cells from uninfected limbs and not at all in PBL cultures. Three dogs with responsive node cells produced the least amount of anti-BpA antibody in culture. Injections of B. pahangi adult worm excretory/secretory products (ES), totaling 1 mg over 48 h, into the limb of the original infections in seven dogs, resulted in inhibition of Ag-driven proliferation by cell populations previously responsive to BpA. There was a loss of PBL responsiveness by all but one infected dog and a loss of node cell response by the two dogs previously responsive in infected and uninfected nodes. This loss of responsiveness lasted at least 28 days in three dogs. There was no evidence of suppression of responses to mitogens either before or after ES injection. In contrast, BpA-specific antibody production was greatly increased in node cells from infected limbs injected with ES. Similar injections into the uninfected limbs of two infected dogs produced no change of proliferative responses or of antibody production in the uninfected node. These results indicate that ES can modulate immune cell, Ag-driven proliferation, and simultaneously enhance antibody production in previously infected nodes. This may promote parasite survival by inhibiting cellular attack based on delayed-type hypersensitivity while directing immune responses toward production of antibodies that are less damaging to the adult helminth.\r"

The 5' untranslated region of the TAPA-1 gene resembles housekeeping gene promoters with respect to G + C content and the presence of potential Sp1 binding sites. The chromosomal localization of human and murine TAPA-1 genes was determined by Southern blot experiments using DNA from somatic cell hybrids. The genes were found to be part of a conserved syntenic group in mouse chromosome 7 and the short arm of human chromosome 11.

  ".W": "CD28, initially detected on human T lymphocytes with the help of antibodies, and CTLA-4, obtained by reverse genetics through its preferential expression in mouse activated T cells, are both single-V domain members of the Ig superfamily. Early work showed a relationship between these two molecules, which we wished to further document, in particular because of the growing realization of the functional importance of CD28 in some T cell activation pathways. Isolation and analysis of the mouse CTLA-4 gene and further analysis of the human CTLA-4 gene showed that both of these and the human CD28 gene share the same overall intron/exon organization. The nucleic acid sequence homology of the exons was found to extend across both molecules and species, whereas the 5' and 3' flanking regions exhibited homology across species but not between molecules. Message expression of human CTLA-4 was only detected in activated T cells and, thus, shares with that of mouse CTLA-4 and of mouse and human CD28 a lymphoid tissue distribution, although apparently broader for the latter. Two main human CTLA-4 transcripts of about 1.8 and 0.8 kb were detected, the smaller of which may derive, as reported for human CD28, from the use of an alternate degenerated polyadenylation signal sequence. The nucleic acid sequence data allowed a direct comparison of the four putative complete protein sequences of CD28 and CTLA-4 in the mouse and the human, showing striking homologies, especially in some stretches (such as a MYPPPY hexamer in the hinge region) conserved across molecules and across species. The mouse CD28 gene was localized to chromosome 1 band C by in situ hybridization with three different radioactive probes, indicating, together with previous data, that the CD28 and CTLA-4 genes map to the same chromosomal region in both the mouse and the human. Thus, CD28 and CTLA-4 were found to be strikingly similar in most respects, in terms of structure, sequence, expression, and gene location, furthermore in two species, strongly suggesting that their genes are the direct products of a duplication event and raising the possibility of functional homologies between the corresponding proteins.\r"

A TATA box sequence is located at position -25 relative to the transcription initiation site, which was determined by RNase protection. The genomic organization of granzyme F is similar to that of granzyme B and granzyme C, leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, rat mast cell protease II, and complement factor D (adipsin). By the use of two fluorochromes for simultaneous high resolution in situ hybridization, the granzyme F gene was localized in close proximity distally from the TCR alpha-chain locus on mouse chromosome 14.\r"

  ".U": "91318147\r", 
  ".W": "TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (LT, TNF-beta) genes are tandemly arranged and map within the MHC centromeric to HLA-B and telomeric to the class III genes. Both cytokines encoded by these genes are potent immunomodulators. On the other hand, some MHC-linked autoimmune diseases are characterized by abnormal levels of their expression or inducibility. A search for the putative disease-associated TNF/LT alleles depends on the informative genetic markers at the TNF locus. Previously, a low degree of genetic polymorphism at the human TNF locus has been reported, mostly bi-allelic RFLP. To localize and define additional polymorphic markers, we probed the collection of genomic clones with synthetic tandemly repeated dinucleotides, corresponding to the sequences known as microsatellites. We mapped and characterized three (TC/GA) and one (AC/GT) repeats within cloned 40-kb DNA comprising the human TNF locus. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique, we analyzed three of these four microsatellites and observed their length of polymorphism. Using DNA samples from blood donors, two families, and three human cell lines, we detected 13 distinct alleles of the AC/GT microsatellite neighboring human TNF genes. The variability was further increased by simultaneous analysis of the second linked microsatellite. This linked TC/GA repeat showed at least five alleles, whereas the least polymorphic TC/GA repeat located in the first intron of LT (TNF-beta) gene had two alleles. TNF alleles defined by microsatellites were stably inherited and segregated in the Mendelian way. Therefore, we describe thus far the most informative level of DNA sequence polymorphism in this part of human MHC. We propose a nomenclature for microsatellite tagged LT/TNF alleles based on their size and variability, which could also be extended to include RFLP and other not yet identified polymorphic markers. Microsatellite tagged polymorphism described here can be used in systematic linkage studies of HLA-associated diseases.\r"

The murine Fc epsilon RII gene spans 12.9 kb and includes 12 exons surrounding 11 introns. The composite exon sequence is virtually identical to previously reported murine Fc epsilon RII cDNA sequences. Much of the proximal promoter regions of the mouse and human homologues of Fc epsilon RII show remarkable homology to each other, including three promoter elements previously identified for MHC class II genes. The reported exon/intron structure of the human FC epsilon RII is similar to the murine homologue, except that the latter has an additional exon coding for a fourth amino acid repetitive sequence (vs three in the human gene). RNase protection studies have identified an additional transcript within intron 2 of murine Fc epsilon RIIa, similar to the human Fc epsilon RIIb form but with a different predicted sequence of the first six amino acids. This transcript is present in the mRNA of purified splenic B cells, but not in the mRNA of the Fc epsilon RII+ B lymphoma cell line M12.4.5. The murine Fc epsilon RII gene contains a large intron (4.2 kb) separating the lectin and nonlectin coding regions, and several repetitive sequences are found clustered within this intron. These results emphasize the importance of the demarcation between these domains and allude to their evolutionary and functional significance.\r"

  ".U": "91318151\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the mouse antiidiotypic mAb MK2-23 elicited with the syngeneic anti-human high molecular weight melanoma-associated Ag (HMW-MAA) mAb 763.74 elicits anti-HMW-MAA antibodies in syngeneic hosts and in patients with melanoma. The present investigation has characterized the fine specificity of antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23, tested its ability to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells and analyzed the variables that influence the immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23. The anti-HMW-MAA antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23 recognize the same population of molecules recognized by mAb 763.74, react with the same (or spatially close) determinant(s) and express the idiotopes recognized by mAb MK2-23 in their Ag-combining sites. The antiidiotypic antibodies that bind to HMW-MAA have a lower titer than those that do not. These results in conjunction with those obtained in mice using a suboptimal immunization schedule suggest that the idiotope(s) that mimic(s) the mAb 763.74-defined determinant of the HMW-MAA is less immunogenic than those that do not. mAb MK2-23 induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells. Therefore, mAb MK2-23 represents the first example of mouse antiidiotypic mAb that induces a cellular and humoral immunity to a human tumor-associated Ag (TAA), because the previously described mouse antiidiotypic mAb that bear the mirror image of TAA have been shown to induce only humoral anti-TAA immunity. The immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23 is markedly enhanced by its conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and its administration with FA. Furthermore, the number of immunizations and the doses of mAb MK2-23 injected influence its immunogenicity, although to a lower extent than conjugation to a carrier and mixing with an adjuvant. The information derived from the present investigation represents a useful background to optimize the immunization schedule with mAb MK2-23 in patients with melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "It has previously been reported that T lymphocytes can be targeted by using bispecific antibodies consisting of anti-target antibody and anti-CD3. In the present study, a bispecific mAb was developed by somatic hybridization of mouse hybridomas, one producing a mAb against the Id determinant of the mouse B cell lymphoma 38C13 and the other a mAb against a polymorphic determinant on murine CD3. The bispecific antibody, anti-38C13 x anti-CD3, is bi-isotypic (IgG1 x IgG2a) and was purified by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. The dual specificity of the hybrid hybridoma-produced mAb could be demonstrated by flow cytometry, the induction of T cell proliferation, the induction of IL-2 secretion by polyclonal T cells, and redirected lysis of the relevant target cells. The hybrid (bi-isotypic) Fc part of the bispecific antibodies was nonfunctional in FcR-dependent redirected lysis. In vivo studies demonstrate that this bispecific mAb could efficiently target T cells towards the tumor cells, resulting in long term survival and cure of the lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify human melanoma-associated Ag (MAA) that are immunogenic in patients, because these molecules may be useful immunogens to implement active specific immunotherapy. To this end, an expression cDNA library constructed from the human melanoma cell line A375 was screened with sera from patients with melanoma. A 1029-bp cDNA (designated D-1) was isolated. Its nucleotide sequence showed no significant homology with viral and mammalian sequences stored in GE-NETYX. cDNA D-1 hybridized to a 2.0-kb mRNA species from human melanoma, neuroblastoma, erythroleukemia, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid cell lines but not from a renal carcinoma cell line, PBL, and cultured skin fibroblasts. The D-1 clone produced a fusion protein that displayed a significantly higher reactivity with sera from patients with melanoma than from healthy controls. Furthermore, D-1 fusion protein induced in mice antibodies that immunoprecipitated a 50-kDa component from cultured human melanoma cells. The structural properties of D-1 MAA are different from those of previously described MAA. These results suggest that the approach we have applied may be useful to identify novel MAA expressed by melanoma cells. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of recombinant D-1 protein suggests that it may be a valuable immunogen to implement active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, if additional experiments show that it has the appropriate tissue distribution.\r"

Neonatal B cells are markedly deficient in proliferative responses to anti-Ig antibodies + IL-4 or to anti-Ig conjugated to dextran, both of which induce strong proliferation of adult B cells in the absence of T lymphocytes. Anti-Ig antibodies actually inhibit the functional responses of neonatal B cells, even to polyclonal stimuli such as LPS. However, Th cells induce both proliferation and Ig secretion by neonatal B cells in the presence of Ag that bind to B cell Ig and are subsequently presented by the B cells. Thus, in neonatal B lymphocytes, cross-linking of membrane Ig in the absence of Th cells has a net inhibitory effect, and this inhibition is overcome by T cell help. These results also suggest that unresponsiveness or tolerance to thymus-independent Ag is induced in the B cells themselves, but tolerance to thymus-dependent proteins resides primarily in the T cell compartment.\r"

  ".U": "91318156\r", 
  ".W": "In this report, we describe a Jurkat cell variant, termed JCT8, the selection of which is based upon its resistance to cell-growth inhibition mediated by the holotoxin of Vibrio cholerae, cholera toxin (CT). JCT8 cells exhibit normal cAMP production in response to various cAMP inducers, including CT, together with conserved ADP ribosylation in vitro of G-protein Gs alpha by the A subunit of the toxin. However, after a 4-h pretreatment with CT, JCT8 cells have a conserved expression of cell-surface CD3 molecules. These effects are in contrast to those elicited by the toxin in long term PGE2-desensitized Jurkat cells, which remain as sensitive as the wild type to the inhibitory action of CT on cell growth and CD3 cell-surface expression, despite poor responsiveness to CT with regard to cAMP production. In JCT8 cells, Ca2+ mobilization induced via the CD3/TCR is maintained after CT treatment contrasting with its complete suppression in the wild-type and in the PGE2-desensitized cells. However, as in the other cell types, CT still suppresses Ca2+ influx in JCT8 cells. Increase in inositol phosphates by CD3 stimulation of JCT8 cells, including of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), is only partially antagonized by CT. This suggests either that in JCT8 cells there is a different susceptibility of Ca2+ mobilization and influx to partial inhibition by CT of CD3-triggered phospholipase C (PLC)-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis or that an additional and PLC-independent suppressive effect of the toxin on Ca2+ influx may exist. To investigate this particular point further, we use Thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor that can mobilize in human T lymphocytes I(1,4,5)P3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ pools by a PLC-independent pathway. We demonstrate that the Ca2+ influx triggered in the wild-type Jurkat cells or in JCT8 cells by Thapsigargin is antagonized by CT. The present data are therefore consistent with the idea that CT specifically impairs in the Jurkat T cell model the entry of Ca2+ from extracellular spaces by a mechanism independent not only from cAMP but also in part from inhibition by the toxin of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.\r"

  ".U": "91318157\r", 
  ".W": "Incubation of peritoneal macrophages in vitro before fixation increased their ability to present exogenous peptides to 3A9 T hybridoma cells. The enhanced level of presentation correlated with a greatly increased, peptide-specific adhesion of 3A9 cells to the macrophages, whereas peptide-independent adhesion was minimal and essentially unaltered. 3A9 cells exhibited rapid peptide-specific adhesion (plateau by 5 to 10 min) and deadhesion (complete reversal by 5 min). Peptide-specific adhesion was blocked by anti-I-Ak and anti-LFA-1. Interaction of T cell receptors and CD-4 with peptide-I-Ak complexes appeared to provide little direct contribution to the avidity of T cell-macrophage adhesion, but activated a LFA-1-mediated adhesion mechanism. In addition, anti-T cell receptor, anti-CD3, and anti-CD4 antibodies themselves activated LFA-1-dependent adhesion in the absence of peptide. Unlike the peptide-induced adhesion, this adhesion was similar for macrophages whether or not they were incubated in vitro before fixation. We conclude that the different macrophage populations supported LFA-1-mediated adhesion equally. Therefore, the enhancement of T cell stimulation observed after in vitro incubation of macrophages was due to increased peptide presentation and consequently increased triggering of LFA-1-mediated adhesion. Mechanisms may exist to regulate the effectiveness with which peptide-class II MHC complexes are displayed for T cell recognition.\r"

We now demonstrate that MHC class II+ T cell clones can present myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide autoantigen in the absence of traditional APC to autologous MBP reactive T cell clones. MBP peptide-pulsed T cell clones specifically stimulated autologous MBP-reactive T cell clones to flux calcium and proliferate. Activation responses were peptide epitope specific and blocked by mAb to MHC class II, indicating a TCR-mediated response. In addition, mAb to the adhesion molecules LFA-3, CD2, LFA-1, CD29, and to the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 also inhibited proliferation, indicating the involvement of T to T cell interactions. In contrast to peptide Ag, T cell clones did not respond to autologous T cells pulsed with HPLC-purified MBP, suggesting that T cells are unable to process whole MBP. However, batch-purified MBP Ag preparations containing lower m.w. breakdown products were presented by T cells, indicating that naturally occurring breakdown products of autoantigens could be presented by activated T cells in vivo. These results raise the possibility that T cell presentation of autoantigen at inflammatory sites may be important in regulation of immune responses to self Ag.\r"

The capacity of NK cell clones to function as APC was also observed using the house dust mite allergen Der p I and the Der p I-derived peptide Val89-Cys117. As with EBV-transformed B cell line, NK cell clones could present the peptide 3-13 derived from the 65-kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium leprae, but they were unable to present the whole M. leprae Ag. Freshly isolated NK cells, IL-2-activated NK cells, and NK cell lines expanded in vitro could also process and present TT. The ability of the different NK populations to act as accessory cells correlated with their levels of class II HLA expression. These data demonstrate that NK cell clones can efficiently function as APC, however they may be restricted in the types of Ag that they can process.\r"

Rapid cleavage of target cell DNA into oligonucleosomes has been demonstrated as a very early event in CTL-mediated killing of murine hematopoietic targets. However, the results presented herein and by other investigators have shown that this extensive dsDNA fragmentation does not occur in all CTL targets. In terms of actual DNA damage, there is a wide range in the extent and type of DNA cleavage in various targets. Differences exist at both the species and the cell lineage level. The extent of DNA damage generally corresponds to the efficiency of lysis; thus, murine hematopoietic cells, which undergo dsDNA fragmentation, are killed more rapidly and at lower E/T cell ratios than are murine nonhematopoietic cells, which sustain single-stranded nicks. Experiments using cloned CTL demonstrate that the same effector cell kills both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic targets, producing different types of DNA damage. These observations indicate that the fate of the target cell DNA is determined by the nature of the target cell and not by the CTL. We propose that DNA damage results from an enzyme pathway inherent to the target, which is activated by, not transferred from, the CTL.\r"

In this study we have analyzed a panel of autoreactive T cell hybridomas from normal C57BL/26 mice produced by fusing peripheral lymph node cells with a variant of the BW5147 thymoma line, which does not express endogenous TCR alpha- and beta-chains. All of the autoreactive hybridomas responded to spleen cells expressing the syngeneic I-Ab allele, but not to allogeneic spleen cells. Although all hybridomas were I-Ab restricted, they demonstrated different patterns of reactivity to a panel of APC expressing I-Ab but derived from different genetic backgrounds. In a panel of APC expressing recombinant I-A molecules, changes in the second half of the first domain, which encodes alpha-helix segments that flank the Ag binding site and directly contact the TCR V regions in proposed models, eliminated reactivity of all hybridomas tested. In addition, most of the autoreactive hybridomas also demonstrated inhibition of reactivity to mutations in the amino half of the first domain of the I-A alpha- and beta-chains, which encodes the beta-pleated sheet of the floor of the Ag-binding groove. To confirm the role of processed peptides in the different patterns of reactivity, APC were incubated with competitor Ag and fixed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking before incubation with the autoreactive T hybridomas. The hybridomas were effectively inhibited by exogenous protein and peptide Ag. These results indicate that processed self-peptides are required to activate the autoreactive T cells.\r"

HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines. This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5. It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a glycolipid named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and stained PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of galactose. When its binding to isolated glycolipids was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other glycolipids including CTH. When its binding to neutral glycolipids extracted from tonsillar lymphocytes was studied, HJ6 bound only globoside; Forssman Ag was not detected in tonsillar lymphocytes. Taken together, we conclude that globoside is a B cell Ag expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B cells.\r"

  ".U": "91318166\r", 
  ".W": "The integrin beta 1 (CD29) is a marker for total very late activation Ag integrins on cells, and exhibits considerable fluctuation in cell surface density at various stages of T cell development. We have analyzed beta 1 integrin expression on subsets of human thymus, and on T cells from healthy babies and children, in comparison to healthy adults aged 26 to 75. T cells from adult peripheral blood include a CD29-, a CD29lo, and a CD29hi set. Compared with adults, PBMC T cells from children have reduced numbers of both CD29lo and CD29hi subsets but equivalent numbers of CD29- T cells. The number of CD29hi T cells increases gradually with age, achieving adult levels only at about 26 yr of age; in aged adults (69 to 75 yr), nearly all T cells have a CD29hi phenotype. Most thymocytes and cord blood T cells, in contrast, have a single peak of CD29 staining that is intermediate to the two peaks seen in adults. Multi-negative progenitor and CD45RO- thymocytes (presumptive thymic generative line-age) are 98% CD29hi. Progenitor thymocytes and adult PBMC T cells express equivalent amounts of beta 1 and alpha 4, but progenitors are alpha 5hi, whereas PBMC T cells are alpha 5lo. T cells from children have reduced beta 1hi and alpha 5lo, but nearly comparable numbers of alpha 4hi. This suggests that the major very late activation Ag integrins during childhood may be alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 4 complexed with an alternate beta chain. In children, the majority of CD29hi cells are also CD45RAhi, in contrast to the pattern in adults, in whom the majority of CD29hi T cells are CD45RA-. This suggests that in children, the main defense against infection may reside in the CD29hi45RAhi T cells, which have not yet made the transition to CD45RO and to bona fide memory status. The proliferative response to tetanus toxoid of 4- to 6-mo-old babies correlates with the number of CD29hi45RAhi T cells, suggesting that it derives at least in part from cells that do not express a \"memory\" phenotype. These observations show a pattern of alternating high and low density CD29 during T cell development, which is consistent with the idea that CD29 is a marker for functionally defined T cell sets. Analysis of the CD29 expression of CD29hi thymocytes developing in vitro supports this view. We suggest that the intensity of CD29 expression on a T cell varies, dependent upon the microenvironmental interactions required by a differentiating T cell.\r"

In this study, we examined C activation by anti-Fx1A in cultured rat GEC. In addition to anti-Fx1A IgG, anti-Fx1A F(ab')2 and Fab' led to GEC injury in the presence of rat or human sera as sources of C. Cytotoxicity was Mg2+ and factor B dependent, but Ca2+ independent, indicating that anti-Fx1A activated the C alternative pathway (AP). Furthermore, in the presence of Mg2+ and factor B, anti-Fx1A enhanced 125I-C3b deposition on GEC in the absence of classical pathway activation. AP C3 and C5 convertases formed on GEC (GEC-C3bBbP) were inactivated over time, probably due to binding of GEC C regulatory proteins. This inactivation was prevented when GEC-C3bBbP were incubated with anti-Fx1A IgG. An antibody raised against cultured GEC that binds to GEC in vitro and in vivo had no effect on C3 and C5 convertases, suggesting that stabilization of C3bBbP is unique to anti-Fx1A. Anti-Fx1A Fab' also stabilized GEC-C3bBbP, indicating that cross-linking of membrane Ag was not required. C3bBbP on E were not affected by anti-Fx1A, excluding direct stabilization of convertases by anti-Fx1A. Therefore, anti-Fx1A inhibits C regulation on GEC, which can account for its ability to activate the AP. This represents a potentially powerful mechanism of producing disease in vivo.\r"

An i.v. bolus of [Ala-IL-8]77 (12 micrograms/kg) produced a marked and selective reduction of circulating PMN within 3 min, which returned toward preinjection levels within 30 min, and subsequently exceeded this level. A similar response was observed for circulating radiolabeled PMN, and gamma-scintigraphy determined that the lungs were the primary site of leukosequestration. During the 30- to 150-min interval after i.v. infusion of [Ala-IL-8]77, PMN emigration into acute inflammatory sites, elicited by various chemoattractants or cytokines, was significantly reduced, as judged histologically and quantitated with 51Cr-labeled PMN and myeloperoxidase measurements. Intravenous administration of [Ser-IL-8]72 yielded similar results. This inhibitory effect of i.v. IL-8 was transient and reinducible and did not reflect a suppression of the responsiveness of circulating PMN to chemoattractants. Intradermal injections of [Ala-IL-8]77 or [Ser-IL-8]72 induced dose-dependent PMN accumulation, which also was significantly reduced by i.v. administration of either form of IL-8. These results indicate that i.v. IL-8 can function as a PMN-directed leukocyte adhesion inhibitor and suggest that local secretion of IL-8 by activated endothelium may differentially modulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions at sites of acute inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "P48 is a recently described 48-kDa differentiation-inducing cytokine isolated from the culture medium of the human leukemia line Reh. P48 induces differentiation and cytolytic activity in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, and stimulates the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1 from peripheral blood monocytes. In further studies designed to examine the biosynthesis and function of P48, surface immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis as well as 125I surface labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed the presence of P48 on the surface of Reh cells. Triton X-114-treated Reh cells were partitioned into detergent and aqueous phases and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis revealed that P48 partitioned exclusively into the detergent phase, suggesting an integral membrane association. Reh cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, but not K562 or P815, were able to stimulate the release of TNF-alpha from peripheral blood monocytes in a manner similar to that of secreted P48. Isolated plasma membranes from Reh cells could also stimulate TNF-alpha release. This TNF-alpha-releasing activity could be removed from detergent solubilized Reh membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-P48 column. This study suggests that, in addition to being secreted into the culture medium, P48 is expressed on the surface of Reh cells in a biologically active form. The membrane form of P48 may be 1) a final maturation step before secretion or 2) a cell membrane-associated form that may be analogous to the membrane forms of TNF-alpha and IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Idiotypic vaccines appear to have many advantages over conventional vaccines. Maternal Id or anti-Id that are passively transferred to the fetus or neonate could provide another avenue for vaccination. Based on this premise we have investigated the transmission of idiotypic antibodies from dam to embryo by inoculating laying hens and analyzing their egg yolks for the presence of Id, anti-Id, and anti-anti-Id. The Ag chosen for these studies was BSA. After isolation and concentration BSA Id titers were approximately 256,000. The presence of anti-Id antibody in yolk samples is characterized by the ability of anti-Id to inhibit BSA binding to Id. The anti-Id extracted from yolks inhibited BSA binding to Id by 7 to 53%. Not all of the anti-Id present in samples was binding to a paratope-associated Id because 11 to 16% of the fluoresceinated anti-Id bound to Id-coated beads in the presence of excess BSA. Because a portion of the anti-Id antibodies were internal images of the BSA Id, they should be able to mimic Ag. This idea was confirmed when anti-Id inoculated in hens caused the synthesis of antibodies that would bind BSA and could be detected in an ELISA. Binding of anti-anti-Id to BSA-coated wells could be inhibited by preincubation of anti-anti-Id with BSA in solution. The chicken model provides a novel system to investigate maternal-fetal and maternal-neonatal interactions in the idiotypic network and the cellular mechanisms involved in the ontogeny of the Id network in neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Covalent binding of C3 fragments to U937 cell membranes involved a cell surface-associated proteolytic activity. Two proteases able to cleave C3 were purified from U937 plasma membranes. Purification involved solubilization of the membranes and ion exchange chromatography. One of the purified proteases was identified as elastase, based upon a substrate specificity for benzyloxycarbonylalanine-o-nitrophenyl ester and complete inhibition by elastatinal and methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-chloromethyl-ketone. The other protease (m.w. 28,000) is cathepsin G, as deduced from the amino acid composition, the amino-terminal sequence, and the substrate specificity for succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide. These two lysosomal proteases are present on the U937 cell surface, as confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Plasma membrane elastase and cathepsin G from U937 cells cleave C3 into C3a- and C3b-like fragments; further incubation leads to C3c- and C3dg-like fragments, as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis of the digests. Sequencing of the C3b-like fragment purified by reverse phase chromatography indicates that initial cleavage of C3 by purified cathepsin G occurs at two positions in the amino-terminal part of the alpha-chain, at a Arg-Ser bond located between residues 748 and 749 and at a Leu-Asp bond between residues 751 and 752. These proteases are, thus, able to generate, on the U937 surface, active fragments of C3, which are likely to be involved in cell-protein and cell-cell interactions.\r"

  ".W": "A C intermediate, LAC14, was prepared from TNP-aminocaproyl liposomes sensitized with anti-TNP antibody (Ab) and purified human C1 and C4. LAC14, containing radiolabeled C4, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography, and yielded a 210-kDa band and a predominant 400-kDa band. The 210-kDa band consisted of monomeric C4b bound to low molecular mass acceptors. The 400-kDa band was comprised of a 200-kDa moiety, as well as beta- and gamma-chains of C4. The 200-kDa moiety contained neither C1 nor sensitizing Ab, but it was largely decreased by treatment with NH2OH to the 90-kDa moiety with the mobility corresponding to the alpha'-chain of C4b. A covalent dimer of C4b, therefore, is the predominant form of C4b deposited on liposomes sensitized with antibody. The C4b-C4b dimer formed rapidly (within 5 min) followed by slow dissociation into monomers. The LAC14 bearing the C4b dimer but not the monomer was lysed, although with relatively low efficiency, by the addition of oxyC2 and EDTA-supplemented C3-deficient serum (C3DS), and, furthermore, LAC142 possessed the ability to convert C5 into C5a and C5b. Moreover, lysis was inhibited not by anti-C3 Ab but by anti-C4 Ab. In other experiments, the dimer served as an element of C3 convertase, as well. These findings imply that the C4b dimer, when complexed with C2, expresses C3/C5 convertase activity without participation of C3, and may provide a molecular mechanism whereby sera from patients with complete C3 deficiency retain the ability to induce C-mediated cytolysis.\r"

  ".U": "91318182\r", 
  ".W": "The leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1, TQ=1, Leu-8) in humans, like its murine homologue, MEL-14, is the principal receptor that mediates the binding of leukocytes to high endothelial venules (HEV) of peripheral lymph nodes. In this study, several regions of the protein which mediate receptor function were identified by using a large panel of murine mAb reactive with LAM-1. Individual mAb reacted with LAM-1+ cells with characteristic intensities of immunofluorescence staining, and each bound both lymphocytes and neutrophils. Lymphocyte attachment to HEV was significantly inhibited by the binding of five mAb. In contrast, only two of these mAb were able to completely block the binding of phosphomannan monoester core complex from the yeast Hansenula holstii cell wall (PPME), a phosphomannan monoester core polysaccharide that serves as a soluble model of the natural ligand of LAM-1. Interestingly, the binding of two anti-LAM-1 mAb to cells induced a significant increase in PPME binding, reminiscent of the increase in receptor affinity observed after leukocyte activation. Antibody cross-blocking studies indicated that many of the functionally important epitopes were spatially distinct, and domain mapping indicated that they recognized distinct domains of LAM-1. The expression and function of these epitopes were further assessed by using a variety of animal species to further characterize the functionally relevant epitopes defined in these studies. At least some anti-LAM-1 mAb reacted with leukocytes from monkey, cow, rabbit, sheep, dog, cat, pig, and goat, but not from chicken, rat, or mouse. The reactivity of anti-LAM-1 mAb in several animal species correlated with the ability of leukocytes to bind PPME, and mAb that inhibited lymphocyte binding to HEV in man could also inhibit this function in rhesus monkey and dog. Thus, several LAM-1 epitopes are structurally and functionally well conserved throughout recent mammalian evolution, emphasizing an important role for LAM-1 in the regulation of leukocyte traffic.\r"

  ".U": "91318183\r", 
  ".W": "An enzyme with sulfatase activity has been isolated from the granules of a rat NK leukemia cell line, CRNK-16. The enzyme has been purified from crude preparation, with a specific activity of 52 nmol/min/mg of protein, by DEAE ion exchange and Con A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, resulting in a specific activity of 230 nmol/min/mg of protein. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 40 kDa by gel filtration chromatography at pH 7.4, but the enzyme had the ability to complex to molecular masses of greater than 300 kDa at low pH when crude granule extract was used as the starting sample, suggesting that it associates with other granule components. The enzyme was determined to be an arylsulfatase by its ability to (a) hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl sulfate (Km = 26.0 mM) and p-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNC sulfate) (Km = 1.1 mM) and (b) be inhibited by sulfite (Ki = 6.0 x 10(-7) M), sulfate (Ki = 1 x 10(-3) M), and phosphate (Ki = 4 x 10(-5) M) in a competitive manner. The pH optimum for enzymatic activity was determined to be 5.6. The role of this enzyme in cytolytic function was investigated by examining the effect of its substrates and inhibitors on granule- and cell-mediated lysis. pNC sulfate was shown to cause a dose-dependent inhibition of target cell lysis by isolated cytolytic granules (complete inhibition at 12.5 mM). Sulfite induced an incomplete inhibition (50% at 1 mM), whereas phosphate was essentially without inhibitory effect. Sulfate, on the other hand, altered lytic activity in a biphasic manner, inasmuch as it induced an inhibition of lysis at high concentrations and an increase of lysis at low concentrations. Cell-mediated lysis was inhibited by pNC sulfate in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations greater than 2.5 mM, with nearly complete inhibition at 50 mM. Sulfate also altered the lytic activity by intact cells in a biphasic manner, although the effect was much less pronounced. Sulfite and phosphate caused only a 30% inhibition of lytic activity. These results suggest that the sulfatase enzyme is involved in NK cytolytic function, presumably at the lethal hit stage.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive fluid and electrolyte secretion, resulting symptomatically in diarrhea, has been associated with mast cell activation in a variety of experimental and clinical settings. The present study has used a human colonic epithelial cell line to examine mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Acute addition of mixed mast cell mediators (as a lysate of rat basophilic leukemia cells) to epithelial cells led to prompt and sustained chloride secretion. The response was partially inhibitable by an antihistaminic drug and an adenosine antagonist, suggesting that histamine, adenosine, and possibly other mediators are responsible for producing the acute effect. Supernatants from immunologically activated rat basophilic leukemia cells had similar effects. Chronic exposure of epithelial cells to the lysate mediator preparation, followed by washing, had no effect on their basal electrical or electrolyte-transporting properties. However, the chloride secretory response of the cells to subsequent addition of vasoactive intestinal peptide, carbachol, and heat-stable enterotoxin of Escherichia coli was significantly enhanced, whereas responses to an adenosine agonist or PGE1 were unaffected. This study has, therefore, demonstrated two ways in which mast cell mediators can directly influence intestinal epithelial cells to secrete more chloride and, hence, to enhance fluid secretion in the gut. The findings may be of relevance to our understanding of inflammatory diarrhea and may aid the development of novel therapies for this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils express receptors (CR3) for the complement fragment C3bi. CR3 expression can be increased by exposure of the cells to chemotactic factors such as FMLP or to the calcium ionophore A23187. It has been suggested that CR3 moieties are stored in the membrane bounding either the secondary or the tertiary (gelatinase containing) granules. To help define the mechanisms mediating CR3 up-regulation, the effects of several inhibitors upon CR3 expression and secondary granule exocytosis were investigated. Pertussis toxin inhibited FMLP-induced (but not A23187-induced) CR3 expression and exocytosis, indicating that an early step in FMLP-induced CR3 expression is activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. However, CR3 expression and exocytosis appeared to be controlled by separate mechanisms distal to G protein activation because 1) DBcAMP and the protein kinase inhibitor H-7 inhibited or stimulated exocytosis, respectively, without affecting CR3 expression; 2) the calmodulin (chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine) and myosin L chain kinase (ML9) inhibitors had greater effects on exocytosis than on CR3 expression; and 3) the kinetics of CR3 expression and exocytosis differed markedly. Thus, although G protein activation is a common early step in both processes, there is a bifurcation of the two processes distally. The mechanisms mediating CR3 up-regulation and tertiary granule exocytosis were also investigated. Extracellular Ca2+ was essential for tertiary granule exocytosis, but not for CR3 up-regulation. We conclude that because the mechanisms controlling CR3 up-regulation and exocytosis diverge soon after the binding of a chemotactic ligand to its receptor, that at least the bulk of increased CR3 expression is not simply a by-product of secondary and tertiary granule exocytosis but is the result of the mobilization of CR3 moieties from an intracellular pool of uncertain identity.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in mononuclear phagocytes occurs within the airways during airway inflammation. Bronchial epithelial cells could release monocyte chemotactic activity and contribute to this increase. To test this hypothesis, bovine bronchial epithelial cells were isolated and maintained in culture. Bronchial epithelial cell culture supernatant fluids were evaluated for monocyte chemotactic activity. Epithelial cell culture supernatant fluids attracted significantly greater numbers of monocytes compared to media alone and the number of monocytes attracted increased in a time dependent manner. Endotoxin and smoke extract induced a dose and time dependent release of monocyte chemotactic activity compared with cells cultured in media (52.5 +/- 2.6 (endotoxin), 30.5 +/- 2.3 (smoke) vs 20.5 +/- 2.2 cells/high power field (HPF) p less than 0.001). The released activity was chemotactic by checkerboard analysis. Stimulation of the epithelial cells by opsonized zymosan, calcium ionophore (A23187), and PMA also resulted in an increase in monocyte chemotactic activity (p less than 0.01). Because the release of activity was blocked by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and diethycarbamazine, epithelial cell monolayers were cultured with 3 microCi [3H]arachidonic acid for 24 h and then exposed to A23187, PMA, or both stimuli, for 4, 8, and 24 h. Analysis of the released 3H activity was performed with reverse-phase HPLC and revealed that the major lipoxygenase product was leukotriene B4. These data suggest that monocytes may be recruited into airways in response to chemotactic factors released by bronchial epithelial cells.\r"

Other regions that were also frequently recognized were 341-362 by 13/42 (30%), 297-318 by 10/42 (23%), and 182-205 by 9/42 (21%) of individuals. These peptides covered highly conserved regions in NP of influenza A viruses, suggesting that they could be useful in boosting cross-reactive immunity against the known type A virus strains. In order to define the class II restriction molecules used to present particular T cell epitopes, 22 persons from the donor panel were HLA-typed. The majority of persons who expressed DR2, and proliferated to NP also responded to the major immunodominant region 206-229. In addition, this peptide was also immunodominant in the one person expressing DRw13. The observation that recognition of this peptide is associated with DR2 was confirmed by using short term T cell lines and APC from a panel of typed donors. Further results with virus-specific T cell lines and clones and transfected L cells expressing DR molecules showed that DR1 could also present this peptide. Therefore the results suggest that recognition of 206-229 is associated with at least three different DR haplotypes and this may explain the high frequency with which this peptide is recognized in the population. The fine specificity of the response to peptide 206-229 was distinct when presented by DR1- or DR2-expressing APC. The DR1 response was dependent on the N terminus, and the DR2 response was directed to the C terminus of the peptide.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent negative regulator of normal human B cell growth mediated by exogenous signals, including IL-2 and low m.w. B cell growth factor 12 kDa (BCGF-12 kDa). In the present study, we investigated the regulatory linkage between viral or nonviral transformation of human B cells and the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. A panel of EBV+ and EBV- B cell lines, derived either by in vitro EBV B cell transformation, or from cases of lymphoma was used to quantitate the negative growth effects of TGF-beta 1. The proliferative response of three EBV- B cell lines to rBCGF-12 kDa or serum was inhibited by low concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.2-0.5 ng/ml for 50% maximal effect), as measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and viable cellular recovery. In contrast, rBCGF-12 kDa or serum mediated proliferation of three EBV+ B cell lines was refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) for this differential growth control in EBV+ and EBV- B cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta 1, c-myc, and TGF-beta 1 receptors. No correlation was observed between the expression of TGF-beta 1 or c-myc gene and growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 in the cell lines studied. Our results indicate that sensitivity or resistance to TGF-beta 1 correlated with the presence or absence (loss) of high affinity receptors for TGF-beta 1. EBV- B cell lines expressed levels of high affinity receptors similar to those found on activated normal B or T cells. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines showed no detectable high affinity receptors. Chemical cross-linking studies with a bifunctional reagent, dissuccinimidyl suberate revealed a normal expression of type I (65-70 kDa), type II (85-90 kDa), and type III (280-300 kDa) TGF-beta 1 high affinity receptors on EBV- B cell lines. In contrast, EBV+ B cell lines did not express type I and type II receptors, whereas type III receptors were expressed but could not be inhibited by unlabeled TGF-beta 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Four common final pathways are involved in this model. One of these final common pathways is the sympathetic nervous system. Most Obesities kNown Are Low In Sympathetic Activity states the MONA LISA Hypothesis. A second common pathway is the endocrine system involving adrenal glucocorticosteroids. The third common pathway is hyperphagia. Although not essential for most obesities, hyperphagia may be essential in animals with injury to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. The final pathway is reduced physical activity. The tonic activity of these systems and their response to changes in the diet affect nutrient partitioning between fat and protein. This framework has been used to review genetic obesity, hypothalamic obesity and dietary obesity.\r"

  ".W": "For 16 wk Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts were fed practical-type diets that contained either fish oil (FO) or sunflower oil (SO) as the lipid component. Both diets contained adequate (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress.\r"

Reproductive performance and outcome in the 0.02% group was substantially better than in the 0 and 0.01% groups but not as good as in the 0.05% group. Kittens in the 0.05% group had higher body weights and brain weights at birth and at 8 wk after birth than did kittens in the other groups. The concentration of taurine in milk was much higher in females fed 0.05% taurine (approximately 1.9 mmol/L) compared with females fed 0.02% taurine (approximately 0.55 mmol/L) or females fed 0 or 0.01% taurine (approximately 0.2 mmol/L). The concentration of taurine in tissues and fluids of adult females, newborn kittens and 8-wk-old kittens in the 0.05% group was significantly higher than in all other groups. In general, the concentration of taurine in tissues and fluids of the 0.02% group were not significantly different than in the 0 or 0.01% groups, with the exception of 8-wk-old kittens, in which several values, including retina and five brain regions, were significantly higher than in the 0 and 0.01% groups. These results indicate that the postnatal supply of taurine in the mother's milk had a greater impact than the intrauterine environment on the taurine concentration of the offspring in the 0.02% group; this amount of dietary taurine is still insufficient for a normal reproductive performance and resulted in significantly smaller taurine concentrations in adults and offspring.\r"

The cells were isolated by centrifugal elutriation from rats fed diets containing normal, low or high amounts of vitamin E. The parenchymal cells contained about 90% of total hepatic alpha-tocopherol content in rats fed a nonpurified diet (reference group). However, the Kupffer and the endothelial/stellate cells contained four and two times more alpha-tocopherol, respectively, than the parenchymal cells per milligram of cell protein. When the rats were deprived of vitamin E for 8 wk, the content of alpha-tocopherol in parenchymal cells was reduced to 30% of values obtained from rats fed the nonpurified diet, and nonparenchymal cells contained very low levels of alpha-tocopherol (less than 5% of reference values). A diet enriched in vitamin E resulted in a sixfold increase in the content of alpha-tocopherol in parenchymal cells but in small changes in nonparenchymal cells compared to the reference diet. Accordingly, the parenchymal cells may have storage capacity for alpha-tocopherol. The light mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained high amounts of alpha-tocopherol. These fractions were subdivided by density gradient centrifugation to examine the alpha-tocopherol content in different cell organelles. The lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus were found to contain high levels of alpha-tocopherol, whereas peroxisomes contained small amounts.\r"

  ".W": "Phenytoin (PHT) has long been known to cause folate depletion with chronic use. In animal models PHT has been shown to interfere with folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. Folic acid supplementation in humans has been shown to restore blood levels of folates to normal, but the effects of folic acid supplementation on the PHT-induced effects on one-carbon metabolism have not been addressed. In the present study rats were treated for 8 wk with 1) PHT, 2) folic acid, 3) PHT plus folic acid or 4) vehicle (propylene glycol). Phenytoin treatment caused a decrease in weight gain over the 8 wk of treatment. This effect on weight gain was reversed by folic acid supplementation, but the decrease in brain folate concentration caused by PHT was not reversed by folic acid supplementation, which by itself apparently caused a decrease in brain folate concentration. Phenytoin treatment tended to increase methylation capacity (S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio) in the brain and decrease methylation capacity in the liver. Folate supplementation by itself increased methylation capacity in the liver but had no effect in the brain. Folic acid and PHT apparently had independent but opposite effects in the liver, leading to a normalization of methylation capacity. These data suggest that folic acid supplementation in PHT therapy may be effective in reversing the peripheral effects of chronic PHT treatment on one-carbon metabolism but not the central effects.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a copper-deficient diet (less than 1 mg Cu/kg) for 10 wk. Copper-deficient rats were characterized by low copper concentrations in plasma and liver, anemia, low plasma ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and increased 64Cu whole-body retention. Freshly isolated liver parenchymal cells from copper-deficient rats showed a higher 64Cu influx, which was associated with a higher apparent Vmax of 45 +/- 4 pmol Cu.mg protein-1.min-1 as compared with 30 +/- 3 pmol Cu.mg protein-1.min-1 for cells isolated from copper-sufficient rats. No significant difference in the apparent Km (approximately 30 mumol/L) was observed. Relative 64Cu efflux from cells from copper-deficient rats was significantly smaller than the efflux from cells from copper-sufficient rats after prelabeling as determined by 2-h efflux experiments. Analysis of the medium after efflux from cells from copper-deficient rats showed elevated protein-associated 64Cu, suggesting a higher incorporation of radioactive copper during metalloprotein synthesis. Effects of copper deficiency persist in primary cultures of parenchymal cells derived from copper-deficient rats, and short-term cultures of these cells offer a prospect for the study of cell biological aspects of the metabolic adaptation of the liver to copper deficiency.\r"

Within 2 d of feeding the Co-deficient diet, the rumen succinate concentrations rose 200-fold and peaked at a level 1000-fold higher than that in Co-sufficient controls. Rumen propionate concentrations decreased, suggesting that an alteration in the balance between succinate- and propionate-producing microorganisms had occurred. The rumen succinate can be absorbed and thus may lead to elevated plasma succinate concentrations in Co-deficient animals, whether fed barley or grass. Thus, the absorbed succinate can at least partially overcome the effect on gluconeogenesis of a decreased activity of methylmalonyl CoA mutase induced by Co-deficiency. These findings suggest that impaired propionate metabolism may not be the primary metabolic defect in ovine Co-deficiency.\r"

Purified p-GSHPx was trypsin digested, and three of the peptides were sequenced. Only one of the peptide sequences was partially homologous to a sequence found in human cellular glutathione peroxidase. Because p-GSHPx is a secreted enzyme, we determined whether GSHPx in milk (another extracellular fluid) is due to this form of the enzyme. Ninety percent of human milk GSHPx activity could be precipitated by anti-p-GSHPx-immunoglobulin G. Thus, most, if not all, GSHPx activity in milk is due to the plasma selenoprotein form of the enzyme. In milk of two North American women, 3.6% and 14.3% of selenium was associated with GSHPx.\r"

Absence of measurable liver norepinephrine was used to indicate completeness of denervation. Four weeks following surgery, 18-h fasted conscious dogs were given a glucose load (0.7 g/kg body weight) by gavage, and arterial blood samples were drawn over a 180-min period. The glucose and insulin excursions from baseline (incremental area) were 29% and 22% greater (P greater than 0.05) in DN than in C, respectively. Resting blood lactate levels were similar between groups, but they increased significantly more (P less than 0.05) following the administration of the glucose load in DN (peak change from resting level was 376 +/- 90 mumol/L in C and 728 +/- 81 mumol/L in DN). No significant differences between groups in glucagon, glycerol or alanine concentration were evident either prior to or following glucose administration.

The high dose fish and safflower oil regimens diminished lung clearance of inspired Staphylococcus aureus by approximately 50% compared with the saline controls, but they did not alter lung neutrophil recruitment or alveolar macrophage bacterial phagocytosis. Only high dose fish oil decreased macrophage superoxide anion generation (by 30%). With high dose fish or safflower oil supplementation, the fatty acid content of lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage effluent and alveolar macrophages increased significantly. Low dose supplementation did not have this effect. We conclude that pharmacologic dietary (n-6) and (n-3) fatty acid supplementation impairs the ability of the neonatal rabbit lung to kill intrapulmonary S. aureus. It has been proposed that human infant formula be supplemented with fatty acids either to alleviate dietary deficiencies or to treat pulmonary inflammatory disorders. Based on our findings, the effects of such supplementation should be monitored relative to the possible heightened risk of bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that supplemental arginine may enhance in vitro lymphocyte mitogenesis. To determine whether dietary arginine could reverse age-associated losses in immune functions, we fed purified amino acid diets to young (2-mo-old) and aged (24-mo-old) Fischer 344 rats. Rats receiving control (1.12% arginine) or supplemented (3% arginine) diets were pair fed to intakes of deficient (0% arginine) rats. Another group was fed the supplemented diet ad libitum. On d 15, responses of splenocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) were lower (P less than 0.01), but interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was higher (P less than 0.05) in aged rats than in young rats. At mitogen doses producing maximal stimulation, supplemental arginine did not enhance PHA-, Con A- or PWM-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation; PWM responses at sub-maximal doses were higher in pair-fed supplemented rats than in control or ad libitum supplemented rats (P less than 0.05). Arginine supplements did not increase thymus weights or IL-2 production above controls. In another experiment, weanling rats received control and supplemented diets in amounts equal to the intake of deficient rats for an average of 37 d. Splenocytes were cultured with mitogens at various arginine levels. No diet effect was observed. Mitogenesis was maximal when media arginine approximated normal plasma levels. Our results suggest that supplemental arginine has little effect on lymphocyte proliferation or IL-2 production in healthy young and aged rats.\r"

  ".W": "Four-week-old male rats were maintained for 10 d on a series of diets containing a constant high level of dietary protein and total energy at 100, 70, 60 or 50% of the ad libitum intake rate. Under these conditions, growth rate varied as a function of dietary energy. Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I was decreased in the energy-restricted animals. Total hepatic IGF-I mRNA was decreased by approximately the same factor as circulating IGF-I protein. In contrast to previous results obtained with protein-restricted animals, serum albumin mRNA was not decreased in the energy-restricted animals. Brain IGF-II mRNA was slightly decreased in animals fed the 70 and 60% energy diets and was decreased by 50% in animals fed the 50% energy diet. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) gene expression was increased in the liver but not in the brain of the energy-restricted animals, indicating that dietary energy regulates IGFBP-2 gene expression differently in liver and brain. The results demonstrate specific changes in liver IGF-I and IGFBP-2 gene expression and brain IGF-II gene expression in animals that are growth-retarded because of a restriction of dietary energy.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of developing reliable commercial Doppler systems for measuring vessel diameter and velocity changes during the cardiac cycle appears to be near. Reaching this goal would enable us to obtain volume-flow information continuously. In animal experiments, continuous measurements of Doppler velocity, pressure, and flow add important insights into hemodynamic measurements. Incorporating Doppler methods in microcirculatory research could also provide a link between the microcirculatory and the macrocirculatory hemodynamic research. Although Doppler methods have been validated, Doppler findings in clinical research (using commercial systems) must be considered at best to reflect qualitative circulatory alterations indicating directions of change. Because of inherent technologic limitations and considerable intersubject and intrasubject variability, direct extrapolation of the numeric findings from one study to the other can lead to misleading conclusions. The Doppler results are also influenced by measurement conditions and equipment settings. However, Doppler-derived information can be used as an adjunct to clinical management in many of the diseases discussed above. As with any physiologic variable, serial measurements probably are of greater value than single measurements. With continued improvement in technology, Doppler methods hold promise of becoming an important adjunct in cerebral hemodynamic monitoring in perinatal-neonatal intensive care units.\r"

Their mean (+/- SD) age and diabetes duration were 18.6 +/- 3.6 and 12.1 +/- 3.5 years, respectively. For periods of observation ranging from 1 to 6 years (mean 4.4 +/- 1.5), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured two to six times yearly (mean of 8.8 +/- 3.9 determinations per patient). Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured in single-void urine samples two to four times in 93 patients and once in the other seven patients. The 52 patients with mean HbA1c no more than 9.0% had significantly lower mean AER than those whose HbA1c was greater than 9.0% (20.1 +/- 24.6 vs 265 +/- 1005 mg/gm Cr, p less than 0.001). Only five (9.6%) of these 52 patients had elevated AER values (greater than 40 mg/gm Cr), whereas 21 (43.7%) of 48 patients whose mean HbA1c was greater than 9.0% had elevated AER values (p less than 0.001). Six male but no female patients had mean AER values greater than 300 mg/gm Cr. The 74 patients with normal AER had significantly lower mean HbA1c values than the 26 with elevated AER (8.6 +/- 1.5 vs 10.1 +/- 1.6%, p less than 0.001). These results support the contention that maintenance of HbA1c levels at no more than 9% (one and one-half times the upper limit of normal) will significantly decrease the likelihood that diabetic nephropathy will develop.\r"

Of the 37 patients, six were not initially thought to have measles, which resulted in exposure of 107 patients and 24 personnel. Of the exposed patients, measles developed in four. One nosocomially infected infant died of pneumonia. Another exposed patient was subsequently admitted to another hospital with unrecognized measles, which led to exposure of an additional eight patients. Of seven employees in whom measles developed, two required hospitalization because of pneumonia. Two hundred eleven employee days were lost because of measles exposure or infection. Infection control interventions included prophylaxis of exposed patients, employee education, and measles immunization for susceptible personnel. Of 1103 hospital personnel considered susceptible to measles, 800 received monovalent measles vaccine. No secondary cases of measles occurred in hospital personnel who received appropriate prophylaxis. We conclude that infection control programs aimed at mandating measles immunity in hospital employees at risk should be instituted.\r"

  ".U": "91318372\r", 
  ".W": "From October 1988 to April 1989, a large mumps outbreak occurred in Douglas County, Kansas. Of the 269 cases, 208 (77.3%) occurred among primary and secondary school students, of whom 203 (97.6%) had documentation of mumps vaccination. Attack rates were highest for students attending junior high school (8.0%), followed by high school (2.0%) and elementary school (0.7%). A retrospective cohort study conducted at one junior high school with an attack rate of 12.9% did not find age at vaccination or type of vaccine received (single or combined antigen) to be risk factors for vaccine failure. Students vaccinated more than 4 years before the outbreak appeared to have a higher attack rate than those vaccinated more recently (relative risk (RR) = 4.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6, 30.0); however, this association did not exist when risk was evaluated based on number of vaccine doses received. Students who had documentation of receiving only one dose of vaccine were at greater risk than those who had received two doses (RR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 206.2). Overall, vaccine effectiveness among Douglas County junior high school students was estimated to be 83% (95% CI = 57%, 94%). These data suggest that mumps vaccine failure and the failure to vaccinate have contributed to the relative resurgence of mumps observed in the United States since 1986. The recent change in immunization policy to recommend a two-dose schedule of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine should help reduce the occurrence of mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations.\r"

Abnormal levels of either IgG or IgA were found in 6% of the 150 children. In the latter group the prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity increased with age. Parents and siblings of the infected children had 94% and 71% seropositivity, respectively, suggesting intrafamilial spread. Abnormal levels of IgG or IgA against H. pylori identified infected children with 95% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Eradication of the infection was accompanied by a significant decrease in IgG and IgA titers, with normalization in 10 cured patients in 12 months or less. We conclude that the method described for evaluation of H. pylori-specific IgG and IgA antibodies gives helpful information on the epidemiology of the infection and represents a useful adjunct to diagnosis and management of chronic gastritis in children.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To define the epidemiologic features of childhood hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) on a national level in Canada, to determine the proportion of patients in whom Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from stools, and to examine risk factors for more severe HUS. DESIGN: From January 1986 to December 1988, patients with HUS were reported prospectively to the Canadian Pediatric Kidney Disease Reference Centre, a national registry for pediatric renal disorders, or were identified retrospectively through a medical records search at participating institutions. SETTING: All children's hospitals in Canada and the children's wards of general hospitals in Canadian cities with populations greater than 350,000. PATIENTS: Two hundred twenty-six children, including 126 girls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The average annual incidence of HUS in children younger than 15 years was 1.44 per 100,000; the peak age-specific incidence was 3.11 per 100,000 younger than 5 years. The incidence of HUS varied by region; the risk of HUS in Alberta was 2.9 times that in Ontario (p less than 0.0001). Of the 169 patients whose stools were screened, E. coli O157:H7 was isolated in 87 (51%). Risk factors for prolonged dialysis or death included young age, seizures, elevated white blood cell count at admission to hospital, and shorter, more severe prodromal illness. The rate of dialysis was higher in female patients (55% vs 39%; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: HUS is relatively common in Canadian children younger than 5 years, and is strongly associated with E. coli O157:H7 infection. Reasons for the striking regional variation in the incidence of HUS and for the increased rate of dialysis in female patients are unexplained and deserve further investigation.\r"

However, when the cases found on screening were subtracted, the numbers after the onset of mass screening were similar to those before screening. It is likely that neuroblastoma mass screening has identified a unique type of tumor, which may not be recognized without mass screening, rather than that it has contributed to the earlier diagnosis of tumors in older children.\r"

Biochemical and morphologic investigations of quadriceps muscle biopsy tissue were done, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain function, enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of at least two of five criteria: (1) abnormal results of oximetry, (2) abnormal results of spectrophotometry, (3) enzyme histochemical evidence of cytochrome x oxidase deficiency, (4) deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, and (5) abundant ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria. With the combined biochemical and morphologic investigation, 20 of the children were found to have mitochondrial disorders. In an additional 10 children a mitochondrial disorder was neither excluded nor verified. Mitochondrial disorders are thus an important cause of central nervous system and neuromuscular disease in children with hyperlactatemia.\r"

Each diagnosis was based on the results of thorough biochemical and morphologic investigations. The patients were separated into one series with mainly encephalopathy (n = 14) and another with mainly myopathy (n = 6). The patients with encephalopathy had the following syndromes: Kearns-Sayre (n = 2), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; n = 2), MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; n = 3), Alpers (n = 3), Leigh (n = 1), and other variants (n = 3). In patients with myopathy, three had hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria were the most common morphologic changes in the muscle biopsies. Complex I deficiency was most common in the patients with encephalopathy. All of the patients with myopathy had complex IV deficiency. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA were found in six patients with encephalopathy. We conclude that identification of defects at the DNA level and determination of the phenotypic expression with clinical, morphologic, and biochemical methods are fundamental for future rational classification of mitochondrial disorders.\r"

We report the clinical course of the liver disease, histologic progression of the hepatic lesions, and etiologic investigations in five patients (four girls, three kinships). All had grown and developed normally until seen at 6 to 36 months of age (mean 20 months), with vomiting (n = 5), progressive hypotonia (n = 3), or seizures (n = 2). All had been given anticonvulsants, including valproic acid in three. Liver disease was noted at a mean age of 35 months (range 9 to 67 months), with hepatomegaly (two patients), abnormal hepatic synthetic function (three) or transaminase values (three), and cirrhosis in one. Patients survived for a mean of 4.6 weeks (range 1 to 8 weeks) after the identification of liver disease; all died of hepatic failure. Results of evaluation for infectious and metabolic causes of liver disease and causes of degenerative neuromuscular disease were negative in all patients. Premortem liver biopsy specimens (n = 3) demonstrated an early lesion consisting of lobular disarray, microvesicular steatosis, periportal acute and chronic inflammation, and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Autopsy findings (n = 5) consisted of macrovesicular steatosis, massive hepatocyte dropout, and proliferation of bile ductular elements, with almost complete replacement of hepatocytes by proliferating bile ductular elements in two patients. Brain showed characteristic neuronal degeneration. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction.\r"

During GH treatment some of the girls had a slight reduction in the percentage of CD20+ B cells, but we observed no impairment of B lymphocyte function as demonstrated by the normal in vivo antibody response to the primary antigen Helix Pomatia hemocyanin, administered 6 months after the start of GH treatment. The number of CD16+ natural killer cells returned to normal. Although the number of children with thyroid antibodies increased from two before treatment to five after 1 year, no conclusion about an adverse effect of GH is warranted, because the phenomenon might be part of the natural course of the disease. We conclude that girls with Turner syndrome have minor changes in some immunologic measurements and that GH treatment resulted in some alterations that have no effect on immune function.\r"

  ".W": "All neonates (n = 581) with birth weights less than 1501 gm admitted to seven neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin and Iowa were candidates for a study aimed at the multivariate assessment of risk factors for chronic lung disease while controlling for baseline severity of respiratory disease. Data from 361 neonates were analyzed for all risk factors except fluids; only neonates weighing less than 1200 gm were included (n = 220). Information on traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease was abstracted. A total of 110 (30%) of the analyzed neonates were oxygen dependent on day 30 of life. The following baseline factors were associated with increased risk of oxygen dependence in a joint multivariate model: lower birth weight (odds ratio 1.4/100 gm), higher baseline severity score (odds ratio 2.7/doubling at 32 weeks gestational age), lower gestational age (odds ratio 2.4/week at severity 0), Apgar score at 1 minute (odds ratio 1.6/2 points), male gender (odds ratio 1.9), and nonblack race (odds ratio 2.2). After adjustment for all baseline factors, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilator pressure at 96 hours, oxygen at 96 hours, and fluid intake were associated with oxygen dependence. Neonates with a low baseline severity score who remained oxygen dependent had a higher intake of fluid relative to output, whereas neonates with a higher baseline severity score had higher fluid intake and output. Lack of weight loss was associated with increased severity but not with oxygen dependence. The results of this study generally confirm the significance of previously reported risk factors for chronic lung disease in a multivariate setting but show that risk factors may not have the same impact in neonates with different baseline severity.\r"

Between 1977 and 1989, 1,286,000 infants were screened. The fluorescent spot test was used on samples extracted from dried blood spots. Abnormal fluorescence due to G6PD deficiency (severe or partial) was found in 3.14% of the samples (1 in 22 males and 1 in 54 females). The sensitivity of the test for homozygosity and hemizygosity was 100%. In heterozygosity the test identifies only subjects who have considerably diminished enzyme activity. The test is inexpensive when added to the PKU screening program ($0.90 US per test). We believe that screening a population for G6PD deficiency is justified if the incidence of the deficiency in the population is high and the clinical manifestations serious. The fluorescent spot test is recommended because it is reliable, easy to perform, and inexpensive. The test must be performed within a fortnight from sampling, and the cards must not be exposed to high temperature or humidity.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the pharmacokinetics of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) would show dose dependency, we studied three different single oral doses in eight children (aged 3.6 to 15.1 years) with acute leukemia in remission. Marked interindividual differences in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were observed when children received the 50 mg/m2 dose. This variability decreased when the doses were increased. Six of the eight children showed a disproportionate increase in the AUC with increasing doses; the other two had a proportionate relationship between the AUC and dose. Overall mean (+/- SD) Cmax and AUC values increased disproportionately (88 +/- 123, to 326 +/- 194, to 653 +/- 344 ng/ml for Cmax, and 147 +/- 180, to 451 +/- 177, to 1291 +/- 415 ng/ml per hour for AUC, respectively) when the dose increased from 50 to 87.5 mg/m2 and then to 175 mg/m2. The results suggest that a saturable first-pass metabolism of oral 6-MP occurs with increasing oral doses in some, but not all, children. Whether and to what extent this pharmacokinetic character of oral 6-MP affects the interindividual difference in systemic exposure to the drug in children with leukemia receiving maintenance therapy require further studies.\r"

In each case, rapid clinical improvement occurred within 10 days; subsequent complete healing was observed in 14 children, and partial healing in 2 others in whom treatment was a component of palliative care. Mean duration of treatment was 3.5 months (range 2 to 6 months). Systemic treatment was averted in 11 patients because response to topical therapy was so favorable, but bone marrow or respiratory failure led to a fatal outcome in 5 other patients. Adverse effects were minimal. One patient developed contact allergy to topical nitrogen mustard after 2 years of intermittent therapy, but was successfully desensitized and was then able to continue treatment. We conclude that the topical application of nitrogen mustard is an effective treatment for cutaneous Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although adverse effects were minimal in the short term, there remains concern about the possibility of long-term cutaneous carcinogenicity.\r"

Over-all survival is 83%, 73% and 70% at 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Unfavorable histology, age at diagnosis and the most advanced stage of the individual tumors remain the most important prognostic variables. No significant difference in survival was noted between patients undergoing initial surgical resection of the tumor and those managed with initial tumor biopsy followed by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy and subsequent surgical resection. Survival does not appear to be compromised by attempting to conserve native renal function with renal-sparing operations.\r"

Normal bladders were obtained from children with vesicoureteral reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation. Myelodysplastic bladder specimens were obtained from patients undergoing bladder augmentation. The functional studies included agonist (calcium chloride) dose response experiments and the determination of apparent antagonist dissociation constants for various calcium channel antagonists. The receptor binding studies were performed using the ligand (+)-3H-PN200-110 (specific activity 86.6 Ci./mmol.). The mean maximal response of myelodysplastic bladders to calcium ions was 31% less than normal bladders (p greater than 0.05). The mean EC50 for calcium mediated isometric tension and the mean -log antagonist dissociation constant values of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil were similar in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The radioligand receptor binding studies demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant of (+)-3H-PN200-110 in myelodysplastic bladders was 4-fold greater than in normal bladders. The density of dihydropyridine binding sites in myelodysplastic and normal bladders was similar. Our study demonstrated that the pathophysiology of the poorly compliant hyperreflexic bladder is not related to up regulation of dihydropyridine calcium channel receptors or alterations in the response of detrusor muscle to calcium ions. The relative abundance of calcium channel receptors in the normal and myelodysplastic bladders, and the regulation of detrusor contraction by calcium ions suggest that calcium channel receptors have a meaningful role in detrusor function.\r"

Standard cystometrograms with simultaneous pressure recording of the submucosal portion of the neourethra were undertaken with a 10F, triple lumen, urethral pressure profile catheter. Baseline pressures in the submucosal neourethra were higher than in the bladder (mean 25.3 versus 13.4 cm, water, p less than 0.001). Submucosal tunnel and bladder pressures paralleled throughout filling, with mean tunnel pressures remaining greater at the time of first (53.6 versus 45.5 cm. water, p less than 0.01) and peak (62.9 versus 55.8 cm. water, p greater than 0.05) cystoplasty contractions. Bladders augmented with detubularized ileum had fewer significant contractions (greater than 40 cm. water) than other types of cystoplasties (36% versus 92%) and over-all they had first and peak contractions at greater volumes and lesser magnitude. We conclude that continence following urethral lengthening/reimplantation results from an anatomical arrangement allowing transmission of dynamic bladder pressure changes to the submucosal neourethra and that urethral pressure exceeds bladder pressure throughout filling. Additionally, our data suggest that detubularized ileum provides a large capacity, low pressure reservoir suitable for augmentation.\r"

Two patients had bony vertebral abnormalities and 2 had normal plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine. Therefore, early urodynamic study is recommended for all patients with an imperforate anus and it should complement neonatal uroradiographic evaluation. The finding of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia should alert the urologist to the need for adjunctive management.\r"

To study this concern 8 infant and 3 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) underwent treatment with the XL1 experimental lithotriptor to 1 kidney varying the amount of voltage and shocks. Followup consisted of measurement of renin levels and quantitative renal scans, using 131iodine hippurate to calculate effective renal plasma flow. In the infants a slight change was noted in the absolute effective renal plasma flow of the treated kidney versus the untreated side but it was not statistically different. When indexed to body surface area in the growing animal, there was a statistically significant decrease in renal function. However, peripheral renin levels were markedly elevated in the infants at 3 weeks, and they gradually declined during the 6-month period, although levels remained elevated over baseline. The adults also had central renin levels drawn from the renal vein on the treated side, and there was a close correlation with the peripheral levels, which peaked at 3 weeks and returned to normal. Thus, it seems that at least in the short term renin production is increased in infants more than adults. This finding may be an indicator as to renal damage and is a possible explanation for hypertension occurring after ESWL.\r"

Two animals had a significant decrease in the size of the cystoplasty. Intraoperative measurements of bowel viability after pedicle ligation were not predictive of the outcome. The functional outcome after pedicle division seems to be variable and probably reflects how well the patch has been vascularized before interruption of the blood supply. The augmented bladder may remain viable if sufficient time has elapsed to allow revascularization of the intestinal segment before its mesenteric blood supply is divided.\r"

  ".W": "Enterocystoplasty is commonly used in clinical practice. Many of its undesirable effects, that is infections, stones, mucus production, absorption of urinary components into the blood stream and risk of cancer, result from the intestinal mucosa lining the urinary tract. We report on the feasibility of creating an enterocytoplasty with a seromuscular colonic segment that acquires a transitional epithelial lining. Augmentation enterocystoplasty was performed in 51 male, 500 gm., Sprague-Dawley rats with a 1.82 cm.2 patch of left colon from which the mucosa had been stripped. The serosal surface was used as lining for the enterocystoplasty. The intestinal patch and the bladder capacity at known pressure were measured at operation and at sacrifice. The histology of the enterocystoplasty was studied in detail following sacrifice. Of the animals 40 survived without significant complications and were sacrificed at a mean postoperative time of 30 days (range 5 to 80 days). In the remaining 11 rats a bladder stone developed but it did not seem to affect the outcome of the experiment. The size of the patch could be measured in 22 rats: it was 1.82 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 0.86) at operation and 2.30 cm.2 (standard deviation +/- 1.1) at sacrifice. In none of the rats did the patch decrease in size. The bladder capacity at a known pressure (mean 17 cm. water) could be measured in 26 animals: it was 2.35 ml. (standard deviation +/- 0.65) at operation and 5.18 ml. (standard deviation +/- 1.19) at sacrifice. Histological analysis was done in 40 rats. In all cases the serosal surface was lined with transitional epithelium, there was no fibrosis or inflammation and the structure of the muscular layer of the bowel remained intact. The earliest growth of uroepithelium in the serosal surface of the bowel was noted at 5 days. This model suggests that the seromuscular enterocystoplasty can be constructed successfully in the rat model. The seromuscular intestinal patch does not shrink. The bladder capacity increases and histology shows a uroepithelial lining of the augmentation.\r"

Antireflux surgery is often difficult in such a clinical setting. The diseased and thickened detrusor makes reimplantation into the bladder difficult, and successful reimplantation into the intestinal component is tricky and time-consuming. Augmentation alone was done in 14 patients with significant vesicoureteral reflux in the face of a noncompliant, high pressure neurogenic bladder. No effort was made to correct reflux surgically because, in theory, reflux is secondary to abnormal bladder pressure. Of the 13 patients who have had adequate evaluation with postoperative cystograms 12 no longer have reflux. The reflux in the remaining patient has improved from grade IV to grade II. Postoperative cystometric examination in 12 patients demonstrated low pressure and adequate volume. Correction of bladder dynamics alone reversed the reflux. Conversely, persistence of reflux postoperatively is an indication that augmentation has not successfully returned the bladder to a low pressure reservoir. Our experience indicates that antireflux procedures are not routinely needed in this group of patients.\r"

This condition is characterized by precipitous hypotension, tachycardia and upper body flushing, and it often causes termination of the procedure. Latex allergy has been identified as the possible inciting event. Contact of latex rubber gloves with intra-abdominal structures (handling bowel) appears to be the most dramatic trigger mechanism for this reaction. We report on 10 patients with latex allergy, 6 of whom have myelomeningocele, who have undergone reconstructive surgery. Severe anaphylactic shock developed intraoperatively in 5 patients and during a barium enema performed with a latex catheter in 1 patient. These 6 patients had previous allergic reactions to latex material, which was not detected preoperatively. In the remaining 4 patients latex allergy was diagnosed preoperatively. A total of 6 patients agreed to a skin prick test to liquid latex. Three patients reacted with a wheal size greater than or equal to a histamine control at a dilution of 1:1,000 and 3 patients at 1:100. In contrast, none of the 5 normal controls reacted to any of the concentrations including full strength latex. A history of exposure to latex products (balloons, surgical gloves, catheters, condoms and so forth) with allergic reactions should heighten surgeon awareness of a potentially severe intraoperative reaction. Furthermore, a skin prick test may be used to screen high risk patients such as those with myelomeningocele. A protocol involving preoperative corticosteroid and antihistamine therapy is recommended.\r"

The peritoneal end of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing usually is exposed during the procedure, making the system vulnerable to infections and malfunction. The records of 103 myelomeningocele children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts and bowel-bladder reconstructive surgical procedures (27) were reviewed for evidence of an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst (6). Pseudocyst formation occurred in only 1 of 76 ventriculoperitoneal shunt patients (1.3%) who had not undergone versus 6 of 27 (22%) who had undergone an intra-abdominal procedure. The 6 children had a total of 8 pseudocysts, including 7 pseudocysts that developed 8 days to 47 months (average 15.1 months) after the reconstructive surgery and 1 that developed before reconstructive surgery. All patients had abdominal symptoms (pain or mass) or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Treatment included computerized tomography-guided needle aspiration or abdominal exploration with cyst evacuation and shunt repositioning or replacement. The walls of the pseudocyst were formed by matted loops of bowel. Additional shunt surgery was required in 5 patients with conversion to ventriculoatrial shunts. We conclude that the development of an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst is at least in part related to the prior abdominal surgery. Thus, pediatric urological and general surgeons caring for children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be aware of this complication.\r"

Inbred Brown-Norway rats frequently have kidneys with a delayed urine outflow. In 26 male rats 99mtechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc-DTPA) furosemide renography was performed to assess the presence and degree of obstruction, and the contribution of each kidney to the total glomerular filtration rate. The total glomerular filtration rate was measured as the plasma clearance of 51chromium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The measurements were first done at the age of 3 months, and repeated at ages 6, 10 and 15 months. From the renography curve we derived an obstruction score ranging from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) based on the time to peak, the 99mTc-DTPA accumulation at 15 minutes and the furosemide response. Kidneys were classified as normal, obstructed or equivocal. At the first renography 21 kidneys were normal, 8 were equivocal and 23 were obstructed. The total obstruction score of the next 3 renographies indicated that 29 units were normal, 14 were equivocal and 9 were obstructed. Two groups of rats with unilateral hydronephrosis (hydronephrotic kidney-1 and hydronephrotic kidney-2) were selected based on the total obstruction score of all 4 renographies. These groups were compared with rats with 2 normal kidneys. The hydronephrotic kidney-1 rats had an obstruction score indicating equivocal obstruction, while the obstruction score of the hydronephrotic kidney-2 rats indicated obstruction. During the 15 months of followup the presence of a unilateral hydronephrotic kidney with an obstruction score indicating obstruction did not affect the contribution of the hydronephrotic kidney to the total glomerular filtration rate, or the total glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that the obstruction score of a hydronephrotic kidney in rats may change considerably with time. In cases in which renography suggested the permanent presence of ureteral obstruction the glomerular filtration rate remained stable. Thus, renal functional criteria did not indicate obstruction. In Brown-Norway rats a hydronephrotic kidney is able to maintain a normal glomerular filtration rate during at least 50% of the normal lfie span.\r"

At all urinary flow rates examined renal pelvic pressure increased to more than 20 cm. water as the bladder approached 100% fullness. To quantitate the combined effects of these changes in renal pelvic pressure and urinary flow on the renal pelvis a renal pelvic work index (renal pelvic pressure times urinary flow rate) was defined. Using this index the magnitude of the change between low urinary flows with an empty bladder and high urinary flows with a full bladder can be observed. The results of these studies in this model might be applicable to high urinary flow states or bladders that fail to empty completely.\r"

Obstructive uropathy with oligohydramnios produces pulmonary hypoplasia characterized by small lungs (decreased lung volume/body weight) and retarded maturation (reduced total airspace). Lung growth and maturation were studied in a model of early gestation obstructive uropathy to understand better their relationship and their prenatal regulation. Of 26 fetal sheep studied at near term (135 days of gestation) 9 had bladder obstruction created at 60 days of gestation, 11 had bladder obstruction at 60 days with in utero decompression at 95 days, and 6 served as controls and shams. Amniotic fluid volume was measured, kidneys were prepared and evaluated histologically, lungs were inflation-fixed and volumes were measured, and airspace volume percentage was measured morphometrically. Experimental and serendipitous variations in the condition of the kidneys and amniotic fluid at delivery permitted an analysis of the contribution of the kidneys and the amniotic fluid to lung growth and maturation. Impairment of growth and maturation was dissociated in certain animals, and this dissociation was referable to the histological status of the kidneys and the presence or absence of amniotic fluid at delivery. Growth was normal when amniotic fluid was present or likely to have been present in late gestation, even with structurally damaged kidneys. With severe renal damage amniotic fluid was not restored even with in utero decompression and it resulted in severely impaired lung growth. Maturation was normal only in the presence of amniotic fluid and intact kidneys. The dissociation of lung growth and structural maturity suggests their independent regulation. The data suggest that the kidneys are important in early lung growth, while the presence of amniotic fluid contributes to growth later in gestation. Lung maturity requires both factors, suggesting a primary kidney contribution with the amniotic fluid acting in a permissive or supportive role.\r"

Controversy continues to exist with respect to methodology and interpretation of intermediate obstructive patterns. In this study radionuclide diuresis pyelography was performed in 11 renal units with hydronephrosis and a pre-existing percutaneous nephrostomy tube in place. The procedure consisted of the introduction per kidney of 20 muc./kg. 99mtechnetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and sterile saline as a bolus into the renal pelvis via a percutaneous nephrostomy tube to produce a volume equal to the capacity of the hydronephrotic system. The kidney was monitored with a gamma camera and computer system. Furosemide (0.3 mg./kg.) was injected intravenously halfway into a 40-minute study. The time/activity curves thus generated were relatively independent of the cortical transport phase. The 2 types of curves were accelerated and constant. Analysis of these pyelogram curves revealed a strong correlation between the presence of an accelerated clearance rate response to furosemide and hydronephrosis without obstruction in 5 of 6 renal units. A constant clearance rate response to furosemide correlated with the presence of obstruction in 4 of 5 units. These observations may indicate that diuretic pyelogram curve dynamics may reflect not only the presence or absence of obstruction but also the ability of the hydronephrotic kidney to respond to the diuretic. More experience must be accumulated to determine the conditions under which diuresis pyelography may become useful clinically.\r"

The highest elevations in renal resistive indexes were recorded in nonpaired kidneys, which included 7 of the 10 kidneys in the obstructed group. In the 3 unilaterally obstructed kidneys the 10-minute post-diuretic renal resistive indexes did not differ significantly. However, renal resistive indexes in these kidneys increased at least 15% over baseline readings after diuretic administration. Diuretic Doppler sonography appears to be another useful method for differentiating functionally significant hydronephrosis from nonobstructive hydronephrosis in children.\r"

At the time of presentation 18 patients had undergone 1 closure while 6 patients had undergone 2 prior exstrophy closures. Closure was performed for complete bladder dehiscence in 16 cases and for significant bladder prolapse in 8. None of the patients underwent any form of osteotomy at the time of initial closure and in 19 closure was done within 72 hours of birth. Two patients underwent posterior iliac osteotomy elsewhere at the time of secondary closure. All patients referred to our institution underwent either posterior iliac osteotomy (8 patients) or anterior innominate osteotomy (16 patients). Epispadias repair along with reclosure of bladder exstrophy was done in 13 boys. The upper tract remained normal in all patients. There were no instances of failure in this group of reclosures. Eight patients have undergone subsequent bladder neck reconstruction of whom 7 are dry for 4 hours and 1 remains totally incontinent. Two patients have undergone simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation cystoplasty, and they are dry on intermittent self-catheterization. The failed exstrophy closure presents a formidable dilemma. However, a secure reclosure can be achieved with careful surgical technique, a well performed osteotomy (even if previously performed) and concomitant epispadias repair for male subjects.\r"

Additions and/or adjunctive procedures included revision of the vesical neck reconstruction, bladder augmentation and/or placement of an artificial urinary sphincter.

There were 8 genetic female subjects, 6 genetic male subjects raised as girls and 1 genetic male subject raised as a boy. The genetic female subjects had all undergone urethral reconstruction. In 4 patients urethral reconstruction was done with local tissues and they have subsequently undergone bladder neck reconstruction: 1 is continent and voids through the urethra, 2 are dry on intermittent catheterization and 1 is dry on intermittent catheterization after augmentation with a hindgut patch. One girl underwent a Kropp procedure along with bladder augmentation, and she is dry on intermittent catheterization, in 1 urethral reconstruction was done with an ileal nipple through which she performs intermittent catheterization and 2 await a continence procedure. The urethral reconstructions in the genetic male subjects were more difficult. Of the 6 genetic male subjects raised as girls 5 have undergone continence procedures and 1 awaits establishment of urinary continence. In only 1 patient was urethral reconstruction possible from local tissues to allow intermittent catheterization. In the other 4 the perineal urethra was closed in favor of an abdominal stoma for intermittent catheterization. Ileal plication with nipple formation of the stoma was done in 3 patients and a Benchekroun stoma was used in 1. The genetic male subject raised as a boy underwent exstrophy reclosure plus epispadias repair and subsequent bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation. Augmentation was performed in 5 patients with hindgut segments in 3 and ileum in 2. All 5 patients are currently dry on intermittent catheterization, although 1 required revision of the ileal nipple to a Benchekroun stoma. Staged reconstruction can produce acceptable urinary continence in this complex anomaly. An innovative approach is required to find the most suitable solution for each patient anatomy, bladder size and function, and mental, neurological and orthopedic status.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative assessment of spermatogenesis by flow cytometry reproducibly correlates with histological examination. Flow cytometry of fine needle aspirates from the testis was used to analyze normal spermatogenesis of Sprague-Dawley rats. Aged matched male weanlings were divided into 3 groups: group 1-5 rats underwent bilateral percutaneous aspiration of the testes with a 22 gauge Chiba needle on postpartum days 19, 24, 30 and 40; group 2-5 rats aspirated on days 24, 30 and 40, and group 3-4 rats aspirated on days 30 and 40. This sequential approach allowed for evaluation of normal spermatogenesis and the effects of repeated fine needle aspiration on spermatogenesis. Deoxyribonucleic acid distribution analysis by flow cytometry correlates with haploid (1N), diploid (2N), tetraploid (4N) and S phase cell populations. These cell populations were evaluated and comparisons among each group were made at all biopsy times. No significant differences in mean 2N, 4N or S phase cell populations in single versus repeat biopsied testes were detected. However, there was a significant increase in the 1N population at 30 days post partum in the repeat biopsy group (p = 0.037), which normalized by day 40. This increase in 1N corresponds to the beginning of meiosis, which is maximal between postpartum days 30 and 40, and occurs earlier in the repeat biopsied testis. Repeat fine needle aspiration of the testis can be performed without significantly affecting spermatogenesis in the \"weanling\" rat. This provides a useful technique in the future investigations of the time related effects of varicocele, chemotherapy and toxicologic drugs on spermatogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "91318512\r", 
  ".W": "It has been previously postulated that many cases of cryptorchidism are manifestations of a forme fruste of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In support of this theory the earliest postnatal histological abnormality in cryptorchid testes demonstrated by this morphometric study of semithin microscopic sections of testicular biopsies was hypoplasia of the Leydig cells, which was obvious from the first month of life. The second abnormality, defective transformation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia, was significant from early in life. No reduction in the mean number of germ cells was detected in the first 7 months of life. The abnormal persistence of the untransformed gonocytes resulted in a total germ cell count that was similar to normal controls until the seventh month, when secondary degeneration of untransformed gonocytes led to a decrease in the total germ cell count. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the blunted neonatal surge of gonadotropins previously demonstrated in cryptorchid boys triggers a cascade of hormonal and secondary histological abnormalities that may culminate in a reduced fertility potential in adults. Early replacement hormonal therapy deserves further investigation as a rational approach to the treatment of germ cell maldevelopment and reduced fertility potential associated with cryptorchidism.\r"

  ".W": "The underlying injury to undescended testes may be hormonal, a transient perinatal form fruste of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by blunting of the surge in gonadotropins normally seen at age 60 to 90 days. Ischemia is the underlying injury to testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. To determine if the histopathology of these 2 injuries is different histomorphometric analyses were performed on semithin microscopic sections of biopsies of 21 control testes, 17 undescended testes and 13 intrascrotal testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. The infants in all groups were 30 to 120 days old. The results showed that, as in previous studies, undescended testes at this age are characterized by hypoplasia of Leydig cells, normal germ cell counts and defective maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. In contrast, testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias were characterized by hyperplasia of Leydig cells, reduced germ cell counts and normal maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. One might conclude that the underlying injury of undescended testes, presumably the blunted surge of gonadotropins, causes a primary hypoplasia and hypofunction of Leydig cells, which in turn causes a secondary defect in transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. In contrast, ischemia may primarily cause a tubular epithelial lesion leaving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis intact and allowing normal transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. Reduced gonadotropins and ischemia appear to produce distinctly different primary and secondary pathophysiological effects on the testes.\r"

The contralateral descended testes from boys with testicular agenesis demonstrated higher numbers of Leydig cells, higher numbers of total germ cells and a higher rate of transformation of adult dark spermatogonia into primary spermatocytes than did the contralateral descended testes from the patients with unilateral cryptorchidism.

  ".W": "Among the surgical procedures to treat vesicoureteral reflux trigonoplasty is a conservative technique that preserves the integrity of the vesicoureteral junction. Since its introduction in 1984 by Gil Vernet it gained only little attention in small series. Between 1986 and 1989 we performed trigonoplasty in 51 children 4 months to 13 years old, of whom 47 had primary vesicoureteral reflux. Our study includes 44 patients who have sufficient followup and 69 refluxing units. Reflux was grade II in 25 units, grade III in 39 and grade IV in 5. Patients were arbitrarily divided into 2 age groups: less than (13) and greater than (31) 3 years old. All children underwent standard preoperative assessment. The operation, with technical modifications (absorbable sutures in all cases and muscular incision added in 12), was performed after failed conservative treatment in all patients except 5 who were operated on at diagnosis. Surgery was successful in 97.7% of the patients and in 92.3% of the children less than 3 years old. The only recurrence was noted on 1 side of a 2-year-old child who had had grade IV bilateral reflux. Considering that reimplantation threatens the integrity of the vesicoureteral junction and endoscopic injections still have unclear side effects, indications for trigonoplasty can be extended to higher grades of reflux if ureteral tapering is not required and a sufficient intramural length of ureter can be obtained.\r"

After full thickness resection of a varying amount of skin from the central abdomen, the anterior wall is sutured in double-breasted fashion, thus, preserving all vascularization and the umbilicus. Since 1969 we have successfully performed this procedure on 9 prune belly patients including 1 girl. The results were excellent in terms of duration and cosmetic appearance.\r"

The M inverted V glansplasty was designed to address the factors leading to meatal retraction and the abnormal glans shape sometimes seen after the MAGPI. The M inverted V glansplasty derives its name from the initial M-shaped incision that reconfigures during the course of the procedure into an inverted V. Of 16 boys followed for more than 2 months after an M inverted V glansplasty 14 have achieved good results. The remaining 2 cases had a definite degree of meatal retraction but because of the meatal and glanular relationships they have a good cosmetic result.

  ".W": "Different techniques are available today for repairing distal (coronal and subcoronal) hypospadias but none is universally recommended. We developed the technique of a distal urethral advancement glanuloplasty operation that is specifically intended for distal hypospadias repair even with mild chordee. Mobilization of the distal urethra is performed for 1.0 to 1.5 cm. after subcoronal circumcision and a deep Y-shaped incision of the glans. The mobilized urethra is dorsally split and slid forward to the tip of the dart of the glans previously prepared. Glanuloplasty is performed using the 2 lateral flaps of glans tissue. From January 1987 to December 1989 we used this technique in 74 cases of distal hypospadias with mild or no chordee (patient age 18 months to 9 years, mean 3.5 years). A transurethral catheter was left indwelling for 3 to 4 days. Hospitalization time was 5 (plus or minus 1.5) days. Results after 4 to 40 months of followup are encouraging cosmetically and functionally. All patients were cured. In 3 cases (4%) meatal stenoses occurred requiring meatotomy and in 8 boys meatal dilations were performed on an outpatient basis. In 1 case (1.3%) a fistula developed, which was subsequently repaired without further complications. This operation may be successfully used in most cases of distal hypospadias, with a low complication rate and excellent cosmetic results. It also may be used if mild chordee is present, thus reducing the indications for flip-flap urethroplasty in those cases when meatal advancement procedures may not be effective.\r"

Our operation involves partial mobilization of the vagina through an inverted U flap from the perineum followed by detachment from the urogenital sinus from above by splitting the trigone. Exteriorization is accomplished by mobilizing 2 lateral skin flaps from the perineum and joining them with the inverted U flap to reach the vagina. Cosmetic results have been excellent, although anastomotic stenosis occurred in 1 young infant.\r"

Nonrefluxing controls were obtained from children undergoing evaluation for a history of infection, hematuria or voiding abnormality. Patients with evidence of obstruction, neuropathic bladder dysfunction, urinary tract infection or renal failure were excluded. Bladder (32 cases) and ureteral (5 cases) urine from children with reflux was obtained at cystography or at antireflux surgery. Control and reflux patients were not significantly different with regard to sex or age. The mean urinary NAG level in nonrefluxing control patients was 10.63 IU/mg. (range 0.94 to 26.61, standard error of mean 0.43). Mean urinary NAG for all patients with reflux was 16.47 IU/mg. (range 2.85 to 52.02, standard error of mean 0.9). Two children with intrarenal reflux had urinary NAG levels of 52 and 48 IU/mg. Urinary NAG levels are elevated with higher grades of reflux and this relatively simple assay may have clinical usefulness in the assessment of tubular dysfunction associated with reflux.\r"

The spontaneous rates of reflux resolution were 85% for grades I and II, and 36% for grade III reflux during a median observation period of 40 months. These figures suggest that the spontaneous resolution of mild to moderate reflux into completely duplicated collecting systems is similar to that of identical degrees of single system reflux during a comparable observational period.\r"

  ".W": "Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Current methods for the evaluation of retention of endothelial cells seeded on vascular grafts are limited by the inability to specifically identify and quantitate seeded cells on a long-term basis. To address this problem we developed a method of quantification of graft surface coverage using genetic labeling of endothelial cells combined with computer-assisted image analysis. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells were transduced with a marker gene (lac-Z) and seeded on polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. After histochemical staining in which the genetically labeled cells turn blue, computer-assisted image analysis was used to measure the percentage of graft surface covered by the seeded cells. The utility of the method was evaluated by using it to assess the effect on graft coverage of seeded cell density and by precoating with fibronectin. Quantification of surface area coverage was automated and reproducible both between scans and between observers. Use of this method allowed the determination of a linear correlation between cell density in the seeding suspension and graft coverage (r2 = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The method also permitted confirmation of the positive contribution of fibronectin coating to graft coverage by seeded cells: 73% coverage coated versus 8% coverage uncoated (p less than 0.0001). The ability of this method to specifically identify genetically marked endothelial cells and their progeny makes it attractive for use in studies targeted at optimization of graft coverage in vivo.\r"

These functions contribute to the nonthrombogenic nature of endothelium. Damage during harvest and ex vivo storage of vein grafts may result in dysfunction of this endothelial anticoagulant barrier and possibly contribute to early graft thrombosis. We studied the functional activity and antigenic expression of thrombomodulin on saphenous veins before (initial) and after (harvested) harvest and storage for coronary artery bypass grafting in 15 patients. Also, fresh saphenous vein was studied after mechanical endothelial stripping. After storage for 2.7 +/- 0.6 hours at room temperature in heparinized saline, thrombomodulin functional activity in harvested vein segments was 28% less than initial segments (p = 0.08). Endothelial stripping resulted in a 79% reduction in thrombomodulin activity compared with initial segments (p = 0.04). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed thrombomodulin antigen on vein grafts after harvest and storage, but not on segments stripped of endothelium. Thrombomodulin functional activity and antigenic expression on human saphenous vein grafts is not significantly changed by harvest and relatively short periods of storage at room temperature in heparinized saline.\r"

Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease.\r"

The present study was undertaken to assess the value of 18 clinical parameters, of 7 clinical scoring systems, and of quantitative dipyridamole-thallium imaging for predicting the occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Vascular surgery was performed in 125 patients. Thirteen postoperative cardiac events occurred, including 10 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal infarctions. Clinical parameters were not useful in predicting postoperative outcome. All 63 patients with normal scan results or fixed perfusion defects underwent surgery uneventfully, whereas 21% (13/62) of patients with reversible defects had a postoperative cardiac complication. By use of quantitative scintigraphic indexes we found that patients with reversible defects could be stratified into intermediate and high-risk subgroups with postoperative event rates of 5% (2/47) and 85% (11/13), respectively, despite intensive postoperative monitoring and antianginal medication. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who had a postoperative cardiac event. By use of quantification we found that patients with reversible defects can be stratified into an intermediate risk subgroup that can undergo surgery with minimal complication rate and a high-risk subgroup that requires coronary angiography.\r"

However, we have recently treated nine patients with sepsis and life-threatening complications after cardiac catheterization alone or after catheterization and subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The common denominator in all patients was either repeat puncturing of the ipsilateral femoral artery or leaving the femoral artery sheath in for 1 to 5 days after the procedure. Two patients died as a direct result of their septic complications. One death occurred in a patient in whom bacterial endocarditis with congestive heart failure developed, and the other patient had a large retroperitoneal hematoma that became secondarily infected. Infected aneurysms that were successfully treated developed in three patients. Our study suggests that colonization of the needle tract by skin flora predisposes to septic complications if repeat arterial punctures are required or if a femoral artery sheath is left in place for more than 24 hours. Patients in whom sepsis develops after these procedures should be initially treated with antibiotics effective against gram-positive organisms. CT scanning or angiography should be considered for patients with persistent sepsis, septic emboli, and abdominal or flank pain. Infected aneurysms require resection or ligation because of the propensity of these aneurysms to rupture.\r"

Of 443 studies, 243 were done retrospectively on 59 patients from 3 to 144 months (mean, 38 months) after graft implantation. Forty-seven additional patients were studied prospectively, with direct measurement of external graft diameter after aortic clamp release. Subsequent ultrasound examinations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually (n = 200) were routinely performed. Mean follow-up was 12 months (range, 3 to 48). Knitted double velour Dacron prostheses were used in all cases reported in this study. This cohort was culled from our ongoing graft surveillance program, which includes grafts of other materials and manufacturers. Comparison of the manufacturer's recorded box size with follow-up ultrasound measurements in all cases demonstrated a mean increase in graft diameter of 3.7 mm (23%). Little dilation occurred after 1 year. In 47 patients with direct graft diameter measurements taken after declamping, an immediate mean increase of 1.7 mm (11%) was noted. Dilation was not related to surgical indication (aneurysm vs occlusive disease) or hypertension. Analysis of the 10% segment of the series with the greatest dilation (mean, 39%) did not demonstrate a predilection for graft complications. No significant dilation was noted in the single cases encountered of femoral and iliac anastomotic aneurysms and perigraft seroma. Although dilation of knitted Dacron grafts is to be anticipated, no association between graft dilation and graft complications was found in this series.\r"

Either a transverse or a longitudinal incision can be made, but no study has been done to determine if one technique results in more stenosis or flow disturbance than the other. Six-millimeter arteriotomies were made on the carotid and femoral arteries of six dogs. Transverse arteriotomies were made on the right, and longitudinal arteriotomies were made on the left. Four weeks later the vessels were reexplored. Duplex scanning was used to assess the amount of turbulence at each arteriotomy. Afterward, latex casts of the arteries were made to determine the percent stenosis caused by each arteriotomy. The mean percent stenosis associated with transverse arteriotomies was 10.5% (+/- 4.4%), versus 22.8% (+/- 9.4%) for the longitudinal arteriotomies, (p = 0.001, matched t test). No difference in the amount of turbulence associated with each technique was demonstrated. A longitudinal arteriotomy results in significantly greater stenosis than does a transverse arteriotomy. Unless there is a specific indication for a longitudinal arteriotomy, a transverse arteriotomy should be used.\r"

Recently, use of absorbable sutures and laser-assisted vascular anastomoses has been advocated because of their improved healing characteristics. This study compared arterial repairs with the argon laser, absorbable suture, and nonabsorbable suture for technical characteristics including additional suture and overall success rates, burst strength, and cost. Absorbable and nonabsorbable suture closures were comparable with respect to technique, but laser-assisted vascular anastomosis was technically more demanding and required almost twice as much time for completion. The argon laser successfully closed only 58.6% of the arteriotomies, and 90% of the closures required additional sutures for complete hemostasis. All sutured arteriotomies were successfully completed by use of either absorbable or nonabsorbable suture. Burst strength was similar for all groups, but was uniformly greater than 300 mm Hg for sutured repairs, whereas two of five laser-assisted closures burst below 300 mm Hg. Finally, costs for purchasing ($35,000) and operating ($300/hr.) an argon laser make laser-assisted vascular anastomosis much more expensive than sutured repair. These data suggest argon laser-assisted vascular anastomoses are more technically demanding, less successful, and more expensive than conventional sutured anastomoses when evaluated in large caliber arteries in a canine model. Absorbable suture, however, is comparable to conventional nonabsorbable sutured arterial repairs in expense, handling characteristics, and success rates with the added advantage of eliminating permanent foreign body in the arterial wall when it is absorbed.\r"

We found that patients who were admitted with acute vascular occlusion had a higher incidence of perioperative complications (63% vs 26%, p = 0.001), perioperative mortality (26% vs 3%, p less than 0.05), lower graft patency at 1 year (60% vs 90%, p less than 0.05), lower rate of freedom from reoperation in first year (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01), and lower rates of limb salvage (76% vs 94%, p less than 0.05) than patients undergoing axillofemoral bypass grafting for chronic symptoms or conditions. These two groups did not differ in any of the other risk factors or perioperative characteristics examined. We conclude axillofemoral bypass grafting performed for indications other than acute vascular occlusion is associated with acceptable morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and limb salvage rates.\r"

Fifty-six patients (27%) had a 50% or greater stenosis in the celiac or superior mesenteric artery, and seven patients (3.4%) had significant stenoses in both mesenteric arteries. Patients with celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were older (p = 0.002) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.029) than those without significant mesenteric stenoses. Fifty of the 205 patients had significant renal artery stenoses, and 20 had advanced (greater than 75% diameter loss) renal stenoses. Ten of the 20 patients (50%) with advanced renal stenoses had a concomitant celiac artery stenosis, compared to 40 of the 185 patients (22%) who did not have advanced renal stenoses (p = 0.011). In the present study asymptomatic celiac or superior mesenteric artery stenoses were common among male veterans evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, but the prevalence of significant stenoses in both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries was low. The prevalence of significant celiac stenosis was higher in patients with advanced (greater than 75%) renal artery stenoses who might be considered for prophylactic renal revascularization. Lateral aortography with evaluation of the celiac artery is always appropriate in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Renal artery stenosis with resultant renovascular hypertension has attracted clinical attention because the disease is potentially curable and because numerous diagnostic and therapeutic modalities compete for clinical acceptance. An exercise-mediated disturbance of renal hippurate transport was recently described, and has been implicated as having a role in nephrogenic fixed hypertension. To predict the final course of renovascular hypertension before operation we carried out a prospective study with the goal of verifying the predictive value of exercise hippurate scintigraphy. The study was to test the hypothesis that patients with disturbance of renal hippurate transport (pathologic renogram) induced by exercise would have stabilized hypertension and would continue to be hypertensive after operation. Thirty-one patients with hypertension who had unilateral or bilateral renovascular stenosis documented on angiography were referred to rest and exercise hippurate scintigrams before operation. The results of the examinations at rest served as standard and were compared with the exercise scintigrams. In 19 of the 31 (61%) patients a disturbance of transrenal hippurate transport evolved during exercise, whereas 12 (39%) patients failed to respond to exercise with altered hippurate kinetics. Twenty-six patients went on to renovascular operations; five had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Revascularization results differed markedly when the blood pressure response of patients with positive results on exercise (abnormal) and patients with negative results on exercise (normal) were compared. Ten of 12 patients with hypertension who had normal exercise renograms were cured. In comparison, blood pressure values were little influenced by therapy in patients with an abnormal response, where 17 of 19 patients continued to have hypertensive disease after therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The development of aneurysmal disease involving the rarely encountered celiomesenteric anomaly is extremely unusual. Aneurysmal disease of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries is itself an extremely uncommon finding, accounting for less than 10% of all visceral artery aneurysms. The existence of aneurysmal disease involving a celiomesenteric anomaly has been alluded to only briefly in two previous clinical reports. We review the case of a young woman with aneurysmal disease involving a common celiomesenteric trunk. The patient underwent excision of the aneurysm with successful vascular reconstruction. Although extremely unusual, the development of this extremely rare lesion can be predicted on the basis of specific etiologic theories. Variations in the patterns of embryologic formation of the visceral arteries account for the development of celiomesenteric anomalies, whereas atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and infection lead to the development of most visceral aneurysms. Surgical treatment of celiac or mesenteric aneurysms is almost always indicated. Awareness of potential vascular anomalies and patterns of collateral circulation are necessary for appropriate surgical intervention.\r"

A 25-year-old man was admitted with thoracic outlet syndrome in the C8-T1 nerve roots. The first rib was removed through a supraclavicular approach with excision of the medial clavicle. All symptoms disappeared. On histologic examination fibrous dysplasia was found in the rib. Tumors of the first rib are uncommon and are rarely responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. When the tumor is very large, as in our case, we recommend a supraclavicular approach associated with excision of the medial clavicle. During the liberation of the brachial plexus, great care should be exercised to avoid nerve injuries. Because malignancy of the tumor cannot be eliminated with certainty before or during the operation, wide excision of the entire rib is recommended.\r"

Thoracic radiotherapy (TR) was given to all patients receiving PR (median dose, 43 Gy) and ET (median dose, 53 Gy). With a median follow-up of 44 months, overall 2- and 5-year survival was 25 and 5%, respectively. Patients undergoing ET plus TR had a significantly worse survival than those treated by CR (P = 0.041) and PR plus TR (P = 0.046). Only completely resected patients became long-term survivors (5-year survival, 29%) and significant predictors of their survival were previous weight loss, hemoglobin, and creatinine level, in univariate analysis, and previous weight loss in multivariate analysis. The site of initial treatment failure was mainly local for PR plus TR (85%) and systemic for CR (71%) and ET plus TR (86%). Presented results suggest that surgery might play a role for selected patients with T4 NSCLC, but advances in systemic and local therapy are necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Through histologic review of 1,766 cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions, 35 cases (2%) were selected as probable histiocytic neoplasias. Proliferating cells in these cases had voluminous, granulated cytoplasm, and round to irregularly shaped nuclei often with bi- or multinucleated forms showing monomorphous or polymorphous proliferation accompanying small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and, less frequently, eosinophils. Cases showing proliferation of convoluted cells with numerous benign-appearing histiocytes or large cells with clear cytoplasm were excluded under a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. To evaluate the immunologic character of proliferating cells, immunohistochemistry using antibodies Mx-Pan B, MB-1, MT-1, UCHL-1, lysozyme, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, S-100 alpha, S-100 beta, Leu M1, epithelial membrane antigen, and Ki-1 were carried out in 23 cases. Naphthol-ASD-chloracetate reaction and toluidine blue stain were also performed. These procedures revealed that 12 cases (52%) were B-cell type, three cases (13%) T-cell type, six cases (26%) true histiocytic type, and two cases null type. Therefore, the frequency of cases with true histiocytic neoplasias among cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions in Japan may be 0.5%.\r"

Three thousand seventy-two patients with thyroid cancer, listed in the Israel Cancer Registry during a 16-year time span, were studied to determine the true incidence of another primary cancer. Ninety-two cases were reported as having an additional primary cancer. The prevalence of multiple primary malignancies was 3%. The frequency was higher among patients of European rather than of Asian or African origin. The second primary cancers in order of decreasing frequency were of the breast, lung, colorectum, head and neck, and lymphoma/myeloma. Most of the deaths were due to the additional cancer. The 5-year survival rate was highest for head and neck and lowest for lung cancer patients. These results emphasize the need for greater awareness of the possibility of developing additional cancers, and indicate the need to incorporate strategies for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of multiple primary neoplasms.\r"

In a retrospective analysis of 265 patients, referred to the University Hospital in Leiden, The Netherlands, comparisons were made between palliative effects of surgical resection (N = 92) and irradiation (N = 128). Several methods of comparing surgery with irradiation are possible: (1) all surgical patients vs. all irradiated patients; (2) only those surgical patients who survived the operation (N = 70) vs. all irradiated patients (N = 128); and (3) survivors after resection (N = 70) vs. only those irradiated patients treated with \"curative\" radiation (N = 62). Analysis of prognostic factors showed that in both surgical and irradiated patients, the only statistically significant factor was the (dis)ability to eat. Criteria to be considered to make individual recommendations for either treatment are presented.\r"

This vaccine has been given to 129 stage I and 61 stage II melanoma patients. All were followed at least 5 years and had 87.5% and 63.9% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Sixty-four stage I males and 65 stage I females had 84% and 90% 5-year survival rates, respectively. We saw no difference between those with or without lymph node dissection. Thirty-six stage II males and 25 stage II females had 66.7% and 60% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Of stage II patients, 23 had only one positive node, 22 had two to four positive nodes, and 9 had five or more positive nodes with 69%, 63%, and 55% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Large published series were used as historical controls [6,27,28], and significant differences were noted when compared to our stage II patients (P = 0.001)--those with two to four positive nodes (P = 0.03), and those with five or more positive nodes (P = 0.04). We conclude that there is a significant increase in survival for these stage II patients, at high risk of recurrence, receiving a tumor homogenate vaccine. This vaccine warrants further analysis, development, and use in a phase III randomized clinical trial.\r"

The mathematical model uses four distinct types of cells (normal, transformed, polypoid, and cancerous) and two kinetic processes (mutation and promotion). Arachidonic acid metabolites play a role in the model in the promotion of cancer from polyps, and account for that promotion through: (1) their effect on encouraging more polypoid cells in mitosis to move toward cancer; and (2) their immunosuppressive effect over time. The model also shows that one defect in allowing more cells to mutate to the transformed state is sufficient to account for the chain of events leading to the clinical sequelae of familial polyposis coli. A second genetic effect at another point in the process is unnecessary. The mechanism of action of Sulindac on colon polyps is explained by the model through inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites, most notably prostaglandin E.\r"

Recently a patient receiving 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid for 11 months for small bowel carcinoma experienced a catheter fracture with distal segment embolization in the right atrium. A literature survey revealed 13 cases where mechanical shearing forces on the catheter caused by compression of the catheter between the clavicle and first rib were thought to be the cause for this complication. Interestingly all cases involved patients receiving chemotherapy. Radiologically, potential candidates for catheter fracture can be identified by the pinched-off sign with bending and pinching of the catheter at the thoracic inlet. Recommendations are for more lateral insertions of such percutaneously placed catheters and if the pinched-off sign is seen, then said catheters should be followed radiologically and probably should not remain in situ for longer than 6 months.\r"

Vertical banded gastroplasty seemed to be an attractive alternative operation because it provided an externally reinforced (banded) stoma that would not enlarge over time. In this study, our aim was to determine prospectively the results of vertical banded gastroplasty used as a primary, weight-reducing procedure in patients with morbid obesity. Seventy consecutive patients with morbid obesity (mean weight, 139 kg), all of whom had obesity-related complications, underwent vertical banded gastroplasty and prospective follow-up. The hospital mortality was nil, and substantial morbidity occurred in 3% (two patients). Long-term achievement and maintenance of satisfactory weight loss, however, were variable. The median weight loss at 1 year after operation was 36.7 kg or 48% of excess body weight. At 3 years postoperatively, however, weight loss was only 32.4 kg or 40% of excess body weight, and only 38% of patients had achieved and maintained a weight loss of 50% or more of their preoperative excess body weight. Vertical banded gastroplasty caused major changes in eating habits, and many patients were unable to eat red meat or untoasted bread; moreover, approximately 30 to 50% of patients continued to vomit once or more per week. Despite theoretically attractive advantages as a weight-reduction operation, vertical banded gastroplasty does not seem to be the optimal procedure for most patients with morbid obesity.\r"

  ".W": "In 15 male and 15 female healthy subjects who were 10 to 48 years of age, we studied alterations in heart rate and finger blood flow in response to the cold pressor test and four strong vasovagal maneuvers: diving response (apneic facial exposure to an ice water bag), Valsalva maneuver (forced expiration against a column of mercury to 40 to 50 mm Hg), unilateral carotid sinus massage, and oculocardiac reflex (inflation of a Honan balloon against one eye). Peripheral vasoconstriction as a consequence of the diving response paralleled the vasoconstriction from the cold pressor test, but it preceded the bradycardia that resulted from the diving response maneuver. In contrast, the rate of finger blood flow was high during the bradycardia that followed stage 4 of the Valsalva maneuver. Changes in heart rate correlated with age for the diving response, the Valsalva maneuver, and the oculocardiac reflex. Changes in heart rate and finger blood flow were not dependent on sex. The change in heart rate noted with the diving response was significantly correlated with that noted with the Valsalva maneuver and the oculocardiac reflex. Changes in finger blood flow did not correlate with changes in heart rate for any maneuver. This study provides a response profile of relative sensitivities to strong vasovagal maneuvers in normal children and adults.\r"

Several studies of adjuvant hormonal therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated a moderate reduction in the risk of recurrence in the treated patients. With relatively limited follow-up, however, overall survival has not improved with use of adjuvant therapy. The use of prognostic factors to select those patients at highest risk for relapse is an active area of oncologic research. The decision to recommend adjuvant therapy necessitates assessment of the probability of recurrence, the expected reduction of risk with adjuvant therapy, the toxic effects of therapy, and the influence of treatment on the patient's overall quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis originated by Carl Rokitansky a century ago that thrombosis contributes substantially to atherosclerosis has been rekindled by accumulating experimental and clinical evidence. On the basis of our experience with the experimental porcine model, several important biologic determinants of thrombosis have been identified. The degree of vascular injury seems to be the primary determinant of the thrombotic response. In addition, hemodynamic shear stress and the presence of the von Willebrand factor have important roles in the process of thrombosis. Although there is little evidence that thrombosis is a factor in the initiation of spontaneous, or naturally occurring, atherosclerosis, substantial evidence suggests that thrombosis has an essential role in the progression of spontaneous atherosclerosis and also in the early pathogenic process of the syndromes of accelerated atherosclerosis-namely, heart transplant atherosclerosis, vein graft disease, and coronary restenosis after angioplasty. Advances in the understanding of vascular injury and of the interactions of blood cells with the vascular wall have allowed development of new experimental antithrombotic strategies and subsequent clinical applications in the prevention of these vascular diseases.\r"

A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis. While mastectomy or breast irradiation following lumpectomy prevent expression of the marker they do not lower the risk of distant disease. These findings further justify the use of lumpectomy.\r"

Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term haemodialysis is frequently complicated by amyloid deposition in which the fibrils consist of beta 2-microglobulin. Dialysis-related amyloid disease causes extensive morbidity and has been associated with deaths in some cases. All amyloid deposits contain amyloid P component that is derived from the normal circulating protein, serum amyloid P component (SAP). We have used scintigraphic imaging after injection of 123I-labelled SAP to assess the distribution of amyloidosis in 38 patients receiving long-term haemodialysis for end-stage renal failure. There was focal localisation of tracer at all sites where histological examination confirmed amyloid deposition. Splenic uptake was seen in 12 patients, indicating splenic amyloidosis, but there was no evidence of other visceral involvement. 6 control subjects who had been dialysed for under 1.5 years showed no localisation of tracer, nor was there any uptake of 123I-labelled human serum albumin in 3 long-term dialysis patients with histologically confirmed amyloidosis and positive 123I-SAP images. Negative scans were also obtained in 5 patients who had been transplanted 0.8-2.4 years previously, despite past evidence of dialysis arthropathy (5) and histologically proven amyloidosis (4). 123I-SAP scintigraphy may be helpful as a non-invasive method for both the diagnosis and monitoring of dialysis-associated amyloidosis.\r"

To assess the efficacy of cutaneous antisepsis to prevent catheter-associated infection, we prospectively studied three antiseptics for disinfection of patients' central venous and arterial catheter insertion sites in a surgical intensive care unit. 668 catheters were randomised to 10% povidone-iodine, 70% alcohol, or 2% aqueous chlorhexidine disinfection of the site before insertion and for site care every other day thereafter. Chlorhexidine was associated with the lowest incidence of local catheter-related infection (2.3 per 100 catheters vs 7.1 and 9.3 for alcohol and povidone-iodine, respectively, p = 0.02) and catheter-related bacteraemia (0.5 vs 2.3 and 2.6). Of the 14 infusion-related bacteraemias (4 due to contaminated infusate or catheter hub, 10 due to infected catheters), 1 was in the chlorhexidine group and 13 were in the other two groups (odds ratio 0.16, p = 0.04). We conclude that use of 2% chlorhexidine, rather than 10% povidone-iodine or 70% alcohol, for cutaneous disinfection before insertion of an intravascular device and for post-insertion site care can substantially reduce the incidence of device-related infection.\r"
