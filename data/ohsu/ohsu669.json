  ".W": "1. The relationship between plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (Ir-ANF) and the urinary excretion of sodium, guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) and of tissue kallikrein was examined in seven healthy female volunteers. 2. Each volunteer attended on two occasions, a control and a saline infusion day. On the infusion day saline (2 litres, 0.9% NaCl) was administered over 60 min. Measurements of plasma Ir-ANF and urinary excretion of sodium, cyclic GMP and of tissue kallikrein were made at 30 min intervals during the infusion and for 3 h after the infusion. 3. Mean (+/- SEM) urinary sodium excretion increased from a basal value (time 0) of 102 +/- 15 mumo/min to 222 +/- 47 mumol/min 60-90 min from the start of the infusion and thereafter remained significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) above sodium excretion on the control day. 4. In response to saline infusion there was a transient rise in mean (+/- SEM) plasma Ir-ANF from 6.7 +/- 0.8 pmol/l to a peak of 22.5 +/- 3.7 pmol/l at 75 min, falling to 12.7 +/- 1.9 pmol/l at 135 min. The peak plasma Ir-ANF level on the infusion day was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) above the time-matched measurement on the control day. 5. Similarly, there was a transient rise in mean (+/- SEM) urinary cyclic GMP excretion on the infusion day from 30.9 +/- 4.4 fmol/min to 64.6 +/- 11.4 fmol/min during the 60-90 min collection period, returning to 43.7 +/- 14.5 fmol/min at 210-240 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. The renal function changes induced by dietary protein are thought to result from the activity of hormonal factors that remain as yet undefined. Since a meat meal and high dose atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) infusions have similar effects on glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis and kaliuresis, we decided to investigate the possibility that a protein meal could stimulate ANF activity. 2. We studied 10 normal volunteers who had a fixed protein and sodium intake for 7 days before the experiments. The subjects received a meat meal (1-1.5 g of protein/kg) and, on a separate occasion, a carbohydrate meal that had a similar caloric, sodium and potassium content. Diuresis was stimulated with water ingestion, and urine collections were obtained before the meals (baseline) and after the meals for a period of 3 h. Blood samples were obtained 30 min and 5 min before the meals and every hour for 3 h in the period after the meal. 3. The protein meal, but not the carbohydrate meal, was associated with parallel increments in plasma immunoreactive ANF (i-ANF), natriuresis, kaliuresis and glomerular filtration rate (estimated from creatinine clearances) which reached peak values 2-3 h after the meal. The mean increment of plasma i-ANF after the protein meal represented a twofold increase over baseline levels. 4. We conclude that ANF may participate in the physiological response to an oral protein load.\r"

Clearance of inulin and p-aminohippurate and excretion of water and sodium were measured for eight to 11 clearance periods of 20 min duration in anaesthetized, 3% volume-expanded rats, before and after intravenous infusions of the amino acids L-dopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and 5-hydroxytryptophan. During the final two clearance periods, the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (S-alpha-hydrazino-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-methylbenzenepropanoic acid monohydrate), was infused additionally. 2. Renal formation of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) and 5-hydroxytryptamine was demonstrated during infusions of L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan, respectively; carbidopa blocked the renal formation of these biogenic amines. 3. During infusion of dopa, a diuresis and a natriuresis were observed; during the infusion of 5-hydroxytryptophan, slight reductions in clearances of inulin and p-aminohippurate, but significant reductions in sodium and water excretion, were measured. 4. The addition of carbidopa diminished diuretic and natriuretic responses to dopa as renal dopamine excretion decreased; the infusion of carbidopa also ameliorated the antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan, as 5-hydroxytryptamine excretion decreased. 5. Although dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan are substrates for the same enzyme, aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, simultaneous infusions of both amino acids at comparable rates gave no evidence of competitive inhibition of amine synthesis. However, the infusion of dopa, after 5-hydroxytryptophan, decreased its antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects. 6. These data raise the possibility that dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are formed as reciprocal intrarenal hormones by the identical enzyme, aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, which is located within cells of the renal tubule.\r"

Tritiated dopa ([3H]dopa) was infused for 90 min into the left renal artery of seven anaesthetized foxhounds, and levels of labelled and unlabelled dopa and DA were measured in the ureteral urine and in the femoral arterial and left renal venous plasma. 2. Only a small percentage of [3H]dopa delivered to the kidneys was excreted as [3H]DA (0.59% from the left kidney, 0.68% from the right); however, the arterial concentration of endogenous dopa (1220 pg/ml) and the renal plasma flows (144 and 141 ml/min by p-aminohippurate clearances) were such that all of the urinary excretion of endogenous DA (about 1 ng/min from each kidney) could be accounted for by uptake and decarboxylation of circulating endogenous dopa. 3. Plasma dopa is the main source of urinary DA.\r"

As we have found for other cytoskeletal proteins, actin formed stable covalent adducts under reductive and non-reductive conditions. Under non-reductive conditions, individual and competition binding studies versus albumin both showed that the G-form of actin is more reactive toward acetaldehyde than the F-form. When proteins were compared on an 'equi-lysine' basis under non-reducing conditions, G-actin was found to preferentially compete with albumin for binding to acetaldehyde. Time-course dialysis studies indicated that acetaldehyde-actin adducts become more stable with prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. These data raise the possibility that actin could be a preferential target for adduct formation in cellular systems and will serve as the basis for ongoing studies aimed at defining the role of acetaldehyde-protein adducts in ethanol-induced cell injury.\r"

Controls were pair-fed the same liquid diet in which ethanol was substituted by isocaloric glucose. 2. In immature rats, total hepatic protein, RNA and DNA contents were reduced by 12-23%. The amount of RNA, relative to protein or DNA, was also decreased by 11-12%, though the amount of protein relative to DNA was unaltered. In mature rats, no change in total hepatic protein and DNA contents were observed, though total RNA, RNA/protein ratio, RNA/DNA ratio and the amount of protein relative to DNA was reduced by 7-18%. 3. Rates of protein synthesis were measured with a flooding dose of L[4-3H]-phenylalanine without anaesthesia or surgical stress. In both immature and mature rats the fractional and absolute rates of hepatic protein synthesis and protein synthesis relative to DNA were reduced by approx 25%.\r"

Medical students seeking postgraduate training in categorical surgery residency programs were less likely to be matched with programs located in areas where the numbers of reported AIDS cases were high in 1987 as compared with the \"pre-AIDS\" years of 1980 or 1983. This trend was more pronounced for students from medical schools located in cities with high numbers of AIDS cases. There was a decline in matches to residencies in categorical internal medicine nationally, regardless of location; this decline was also greater among the students coming from medical schools in cities with high numbers of AIDS cases. The authors discuss the implications for medical educators of declines in matches to specialties in which the care of AIDS patients is most concentrated. The imperfect nature of available measures of students' exposure to AIDS patients makes the data of this study preliminary, and further studies are being undertaken. However, the finding of significant effects in spite of the imprecision of some measures suggests that future work will confirm the results of this study.\r"

Their specialty preferences as premedical students were shown by their responses to the Premedical Student Questionnaire, administered when they registered for the Medical College Admission Test; their specialty choices at the end of their medical school training were shown by their responses to the Medical Student Graduation Questionnaire, which they completed shortly before graduation. Racial-ethnic backgrounds, self-recorded, were classified into black, other underrepresented minorities, Asian, other non-underrepresented minorities, and white. Specialties were clustered into primary care, medical specialties, surgical specialties, and supporting services. Before entering medical school, the students had similar specialty preferences regardless of background. As seniors in medical school, there was even greater convergence of specialty choices among the students of all backgrounds. Racial-ethnic background in itself appears not to have been a major factor influencing the senior medical students' specialty choices.\r"

A total of 11.5% of the women and 5.9% of the men expressed a preference for pediatrics on the earlier questionnaire, when they were premedical students; 13.5% of the women and 4.8% of the men actually chose pediatrics when they were senior medical students, as reflected on the later questionnaire. On both questionnaires, 31.3% of the women's preferences and 14.6% of the men's preferences for pediatrics did not change. More than 70% of all the graduating students choosing pediatrics had expressed a premedical preference for a primary care specialty. Fifty-one percent of the women and 42% of the men who abandoned their early preferences for pediatrics chose another specialty within primary care. More students of both genders shifted from a premedical preference for family practice into pediatrics than kept their early preference for pediatrics. If the direction of change noted in this study and others continues, pediatrics will increasingly become a specialty chosen by women.\r"

Since students in the upper 15% of the class are likely to obtain the specialties of their choice, any change in the pattern of their specialty preferences probably reflects a general trend. Specialties that feature a controllable lifestyle (CL) were defined as anesthesiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, neurology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, pathology, psychiatry, and radiology. Non-CL specialties were surgery, medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and obstetrics-gynecology. The results showed that the percentages of students entering CL specialties increased significantly at all three schools, the percentages of students entering non-CL specialties decreased significantly at all three schools, and there was no significant change in the percentage of students entering surgical specialties.\r"

These five characteristics of U.S. medical schools during the mid-1980s, together with the school tuition levels, were examined with both univariate and multivariate analysis to observe their relationships to the percentage of U.S. medical graduates entering family medicine between July 1986 and December 1987. With univariate analysis, each characteristic was significantly related to the percentage of graduates entering family medicine. Using multivariate analysis, only the number of weeks required and the type of ownership of the school were significantly related to the percentage of graduates entering family medicine, with the higher percentages related to greater numbers of required weeks of family medicine training and to public ownership of the school.\r"

The data were analyzed to discern career selection differences among the total population studied, between the men and women, and between the graduates of public and private institutions. Internal medicine showed statistically significant declines in its attractiveness to the students in all the categories but remained overrepresented as a career choice by honors students compared with its attractiveness to medical students in general for the years studied. Radiology was chosen by an increasing percentage of the honors students in the 1980s, but mostly by students from private medical schools. The men who were honors graduates in the 1980s chose surgery fields more often, while women honors graduates tended to enter pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology. These data indicate that the career choices of honors graduates in the early 1980s more closely mirrored the career choices of all students entering medical specialty fields and do not reveal gross imbalances. Of the primary care disciplines, only internal medicine attracted fewer honors graduates in the 1980s.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have raised the concern that personal care specialties, especially primary care specialties, are attracting fewer medical school graduates. In the present study, the authors evaluated the proportions of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), medical school graduates entering personal care specialties and technology-oriented specialties from 1982 through 1988 and found no significant trend away from personal care specialties such as internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and psychiatry during these years. For the graduating class of 1988, admissions and questionnaire data were used to evaluate the importance of pre-admission, medical school, and postgraduate factors as determinants of specialty choice. The group entering personal care specialties (66% of all 1988 graduates) was significantly older and included more women and fewer minority students than the group entering technology-oriented specialties. Students rated income and lifestyle factors as being less important determinants of specialty choice than are medical school experiences and intrinsic qualities of the chosen specialties. However, compared with the students who entered personal care specialties, those who chose technology-oriented specialties over an alternate choice in personal care rated as significantly more important the opportunity to do procedures (p less than .001), income (p less than .005), the lesser degree of diagnostic uncertainty (p less than .005), and the rejected specialty's allowing less time for family (p less than .005) and for other interests (p less than .008). Exposure to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and loan indebtedness were rated the least significant influences on specialty choice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To educate future physicians adequately, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will have to change its system for delivering ambulatory care services and for teaching in ambulatory care settings. Workshop discussions focused on five major areas regarding educating residents in the ambulatory setting: educational goals and objectives, clinical experiences, curriculum development and evaluation, faculty issues, and fellowship opportunities. Recommendations include the need for residency programs to develop explicit educational goals and objectives for resident training, the identification of transdepartmental needs and coordinated planning, the support of academic clinical faculty, research and development of educational programs, and further development of fellowship training in ambulatory care. Further integration of ambulatory care activities in graduate training will require significant effort, a shift in manpower and resources and, more fundamentally, a shift in attitude and commitment at all levels of the VA and medical schools.\r"

These represent significant barriers to developing an effective and efficient system of outpatient health care delivery for veterans and to expanding educational opportunities for trainees. Based on impact and feasibility rankings from the symposium, review of the literature, and the personal experiences of USDVA ambulatory care managers, several recommendations emerged: (1) implement a system of matrix management; (2) invest in a leader; (3) develop \"user-friendly\" management information systems; (4) utilize existing resources efficiently; (5) embrace quality assurance; and (6) improve support from clerical and diagnostic services, nursing, and pharmacy personnel. Although intervention from leadership at the level of the USDVA Central Office will be necessary, many of these recommendations can be adopted by managers at the local facilities. The biggest challenge is to change the attitudes of clinical and support staff whose responsibilities have traditionally been inpatient-oriented.\r"

Results from a national survey of academic general internal medicine units suggest that those that share VA and university affiliation tend to be more successful than those that are unaffiliated. The VA must strive to improve the environment for ambulatory care research. Among other things, this will entail providing adequate protected time to ambulatory care faculty and developing a uniform ambulatory care database to facilitate longitudinal, population-based research. Extended fellowships in ambulatory care and faculty development programs for existing staff will be required to create a core of competent investigators. The VA must also provide increased funding to the Health Services Research and Development and Cooperative Studies programs. Special funding programs targeted to key areas such as quality assurance, medical education, and direct patient care should be established. In addition, the VA should seek to develop joint ventures with other funding agencies for innovative ambulatory care initiatives.\r"

Presently there is not adequate methodology in the VA to determine costs in ambulatory care and education. (Experience with the VA allocation model suggests that selected characteristics of reimbursement systems are incompatible with educational goals.) Barriers that inhibit the cost-effective delivery of ambulatory care in many VA hospitals must be eliminated so that effective patient care and training care can take place. These barriers include inadequacies of information systems, physical layouts, and staffing. Despite the perception that outpatient care is less costly than inpatient care, the transition from an inpatient-based education model to an ambulatory care model will require an infusion of resources to improve the ambulatory care environment in the VA.\r"

It is estimated that from 50% to 60% of all medical students receive some portion of their medical training in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. However, only about 5% of the total student ambulatory care educational experience is taking place at VA facilities. The problems in implementing and maintaining ambulatory care teaching programs for medical students encompass a variety of areas, such as lack of faculty incentive, time, expertise, and commitment; student resistance to training in this less attractive arena, and economic obstacles. Medical schools and VA medical centers will have to work in a mutually supportive relationship to develop joint goals and objectives for medical student teaching. Commitment of resources is essential, as is the need to reward ambulatory teaching through academic advancement and salary incentives. Faculty recruitment and development will be necessary, and research to identify the most successful of the VA ambulatory care teaching settings should be undertaken. The time has come for improved medical student education in VA ambulatory care settings, and there is now a need for collaborative planning between the medical schools and the VA.\r"

In addition, the intraoperative technique and attendant problems, as well as postoperative complications, are presented. The overall advantages and disadvantages of this flap as compared with the more traditional pectoralis myocutaneous flap are outlined.

The majority of these complications have arisen secondary to a loss of structural support following the interruption of the lower lateral cartilages. This article describes the \"lateral crural steal,\" a method of increasing nasal tip projection and nasal tip rotation while preserving the integrity of the lobular cartilage complex. The procedure uses the external rhinoplasty approach for exposure. By elevating both the dorsal and the vestibular skin from the domes of the lobular cartilages, the lateral crura may be advanced onto the medial crura to further project the nasal tip and to reorient the tip upward. This technique along with its philosophy and long-term follow-up results are presented.\r"

Myringotomy with tube insertion provided more disease-free time and better hearing than either myringotomy alone or no surgery; however, some subjects who underwent myringotomy with tube insertion developed otorrhea or persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane. Myringotomy offered no advantage over no surgery regarding percent of time with middle-ear effusion, number of acute otitis media episodes, and number of subsequent surgical procedures.

The interpretation of images was then correlated with the operative findings. In 9 of the 10 cases, computed tomography accurately predicted the extent and destructiveness of the disease but did not consistently differentiate between cholesteatoma and associated granulation tissue. In 2 of the 10 cases, the T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated high signal, suggestive of cholesteatoma. In one case, magnetic resonance imaging predicted cholesteatoma on the basis of bony destruction. However, in 7 of 10 cases the scan was nonspecific for cholesteatoma. We conclude that high-resolution computed tomography remains the primary imaging modality for chronic otitis media.\r"

Air-contrast (air cisternography) computed tomography is the \"gold standard\" by which all techniques of diagnosis are compared. Most physicians, however, are reluctant to use this test as a screen for tumors because of the associated morbidity, time, and expense. We present three case reports of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of small intracanalicular or cerebellopontine angle tumors, and review the literature of this new and exciting technology. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is now the procedure of choice for evaluating patients with suspected temporal bone tumors.\r"

Since the advent of various reconstructive techniques, it is often forgotten as a valuable alternative to immediate surgical reconstruction of wounds. In certain situations the cosmetic and functional results of secondary intention healing are equal to the results of more complex reconstructive surgery. We describe a case in which remarkable results were obtained from spontaneous healing of a facial wound.\r"

A 50-year-old woman with stage 1 squamous carcinoma of the left side of the tongue was treated in 1973 with 73 Gy of supravoltage irradiation. Twelve years later a painful, ulcerated lesion that eventually was shown to be fibrosarcoma developed in the contralateral mandible. The fibrosarcoma in this case fulfills all criteria for diagnosing radiation-induced neoplasia and demonstrates that supravoltage irradiation, like other forms of irradiation, can cause malignancy. The occasional occurrence of sarcoma should be recalled during follow-up of patients treated with supravoltage radiation. Similarly, the possibility of radiation-induced tumors should be considered in planning treatment for younger patients with tumors that can be treated equally well by surgery or irradiation.\r"

The whole recording period was analysed in 11 patients (five inferior and six anterior), and intermittent hourly periods were analysed in all 21 subjects. Mean RR counts were significantly lower in patients with anterior than inferior infarction, and below the normal range. Although mean heart rates were faster in the group with anterior infarction, there was a dissociation between RR counts and mean heart rate that was consistent with RR interval variability being an independent measure of parasympathetic activity. This study indicates that cardiac parasympathetic activity during acute myocardial infarction can be simply and reliably assessed from continuous electrocardiographic recordings, and it showed significantly lower cardiac parasympathetic activity in patients with anterior infarction.\r"

Aortic regurgitant murmurs were recorded in only three of 87 patients and in none of the controls. Colour Doppler echocardiography showed an aortic regurgitant signal in 20 (23%) of the patients and three (6%) of the 48 controls. The colour Doppler signals typical of aortic regurgitation were limited to the left ventricular outflow tract. There were no significant differences between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with and without aortic regurgitation in terms of age (59 years v 56 years), blood pressure (140/84 mm Hg v 136/80 mm Hg), aortic diameter (34 mm v 33 mm), or frequency of calcification of the aortic valve (15% v 10%) and of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with mitral-septal contact (25% v 16%). On cross sectional echocardiograms, the degree of septal protrusion into the left ventricular outflow tract during systole was significantly more prominent (15 v 10 mm), and the portion of the basal septum that protruded most deeply into the left ventricular outflow tract was significantly closer to the aortic annulus in patients with aortic regurgitation than in those without it (11 v 14 mm). Mild aortic regurgitation was found in almost a quarter of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The regurgitation was related to the morphological abnormality of the left ventricular outflow tract.\r"

This interpolation allows correction of the artificially produced skewness of velocities across the flow sector caused by the time taken to scan the flow sector for velocity recording of pulsatile blood flow. These results suggested that early mitral flow studied in an apical four chamber view is variably skewed both at the leaflet tips and at the annulus. The maximum flow velocity overestimated the cross sectional mean velocity at the same time by a factor of 1.2-2.2. Also the maximum time velocity integral overestimated the cross sectional mean time velocity integral to the same extent. This cross sectional skew must be taken into account when calculation of blood flow is based on recordings with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound from a single sample volume.\r"

  ".W": "Acromegaly is associated with an increased cardiac morbidity and mortality, but it is not clear whether this is the result of increased incidence of hypertension and coronary heart disease or of a specific disease of heart muscle. Thirty four acromegalic patients were studied by non-invasive techniques. Seven of these patients had raised plasma concentrations of growth hormone at the time of study; three were newly diagnosed and had not received any treatment. Hypertension was present in nine (26%) but only three (9%) had electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography showed ventricular hypertrophy in 12 (48%) and increased left ventricular mass in 17 (68%) patients. Holter monitoring detected important ventricular arrhythmias in 14 patients. Thallium-201 scanning showed evidence for coronary heart disease in eight patients. Systolic time intervals were normal except when there was coexistent ischaemic heart disease. A comparison between 19 acromegalic patients with no other detectable cause of heart disease and 22 age matched controls showed appreciably abnormal left ventricular diastolic function in the group with acromegaly. The abnormalities shown did not correlate with left ventricular mass or wall thickness. There was no difference in diastolic function between patients with active acromegaly and those with treated acromegaly. Hypertensive acromegalic patients had worse diastolic function than hypertensive controls, suggesting that hypertension may further impair the left ventricular diastolic abnormality in acromegaly. This is the first study to find evidence of subclinical cardiac diastolic dysfunction in acromegaly and it supports the suggestion that there is a specific disease of heart muscle in acromegaly.\r"

In 40 patients who had narrow complex tachycardias (QRS less than 0.12 s) adenosine (2.5-25 mg) restored sinus rhythm in 25 with junctional tachycardias (46 of 48 episodes) and produced atrioventricular block to reveal atrial or sinus tachycardia in 15. In 24 patients with broad complex tachycardias (QRS greater than or equal to 0.12 s) adenosine terminated the tachycardias in six patients and revealed atrial or sinus arrhythmias in four. The tachycardias persisted in 14 patients despite doses up to 20 mg, but adenosine allowed the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia with retrograde atrial activation in two patients by producing transient ventriculoatrial dissociation. Diagnosis based on adenosine induced atrioventricular nodal block was correct in all patients with narrow complex tachycardias and in 92% of those with broad complex tachycardias, compared with correct electrocardiographic diagnoses in 90% and 75% respectively. Adenosine gave diagnostic information additional to the electrocardiogram in 25%. The response to adenosine in broad complex tachycardias identified those of supraventricular origin with 90% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 92% predictive accuracy. Adenosine restored sinus rhythm in all patients with junctional reentrant tachycardias, but in 10 (35%) the arrhythmias recurred within two minutes. Symptomatic side effects (dyspnoea, chest pain, flushing, headache) were reported by 40 (63%) patients and, although transient, were severe in 23 (36%). There were ventricular pauses of over 2 s in 16% of patients, the longest pause being 6.1 s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adenosine was prepared in a sterile solution of 0.9% saline (1 mg/ml) and given in incremental doses of 0.05 mg/kg every two minutes to a maximum of 0.25 mg/kg. Ninety of the 117 episodes were terminated. This included 88 of the 102 episodes of junctional tachycardia (79 of the 92 episodes of atrioventricular reentry tachycardia, seven of the eight episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, and both of the episodes of long R-P' tachycardia). Only one of four episodes of His bundle tachycardia and one of the eight episodes of ectopic atrial tachycardia were terminated. None of the three episodes of atrial flutter were terminated. Side effects were frequent but mild and included transient complete atrioventricular block (less than 6 s), sinus bradycardia (less than 40 s), ventricular extrasystoles, flushing, nausea, headache, and respiratory disturbance. Reinitiation (within 5 s) of supraventricular tachycardia occurred in 13 of the terminated episodes. Although reinitiation limited its clinical efficacy in some patients, intravenous adenosine offered a safe and efficient method of rapid termination of most episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and in some cases facilitated diagnosis of the mechanism.\r"

The maximum value measured by Doppler when the patient was unsedated was significantly higher than that measured when the patient was sedated for catheterisation, and the maximum gradient was significantly higher shortly after than several days later. In a patient with pronounced infundibular obstruction after dilatation the Doppler signal clearly showed that the obstruction was dynamic, with a superimposed lower fixed signal that correctly predicted the final low gradient. The Doppler gradient in an alert and unsedated patient may be a better measure of the true physiological value. The highest Doppler value so obtained is a more appropriate indicator of the need for balloon dilatation than a single catheter measurement. The result of dilatation is best assessed by Doppler measurement at least a day after the procedure.\r"

In the case of HLA Class I disparity, where all donor cells express the target antigen, the presence of alpha-donor antibody was associated with complete graft failure and death. In the case of ABO blood group antigen disparity, the presence of alpha-donor antibody resulted in erythroid hypoplasia.

As a result, the remnant cells are depleted of these proteins. We suggest that alterations in the architecture of the RBC membrane that precede vesiculation lead to selective polarization of GPI-anchored proteins within the domain of the membrane destined to become a vesicle. Since vesiculation occurs in many cell types, and if the loss of GPI-anchored proteins accompanies this process, it may have important biologic significance.\r"

Two genetic changes in factor X have been observed in this patient. The patient is most likely a compound heterozygote since there is only 14% activity associated with factor X. A point mutation that resulted in the substitution of cysteine (TGC) for arginine (CGC) at amino acid 366 was found in exon VIII of one allele of the factor X gene. This mutation, which occurs in the catalytic domain, can affect the formation of a disulfide bridge and thus could result in a reduction in factor X activity. Sequencing all the regions revealed a second mutation: a deletion of one nucleotide (TCCT to TCT) in exon VII that would cause a frame shift at amino acid 272 followed by termination. We have also shown that the point mutation in exon VIII creates an ApaL1 restriction site and destroys the HinP1 site. Enzymatic DNA amplification followed by restriction digestion provides a quick, reliable, and sensitive method for carrier detection and antenatal diagnosis in affected kindreds. This is the first characterization of factor X deficiency at the molecular level. We propose to name this mutation Factor XSan Antonio.\r"

  ".W": "The combination of high-dose busulfan (16 mg/kg) and 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide is gaining increasing significance as a preparative regimen prior to autologous, syngeneic, or allogeneic marrow transplantation. A new regimen of high-dose busulfan in conjunction with a reduced dose of 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide has recently been described as a preparative regimen prior to allogeneic transplantation. To determine the drug-related nonhematologic toxic effects of this new regimen without confounding factors associated with allogeneic transplantation, we conducted a pilot study using this new regimen in 20 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first remission prior to autologous unpurged marrow transplantation. All patients experienced transient non-life-threatening acute drug-related toxicity with skin reactions in 20 (100%), nausea and vomiting in 20 (100%), oral mucositis in 18 (90%), hepatic functional impairment in 17 (85%), hemorrhagic cystitis in three (15%), and generalized seizures in two (10%) of these patients, respectively. Two procedural, fatal complications resulted from infectious causes that were not directly related to the speed of hematopoietic reconstitution or the toxicity of the preparative regimen. The 3-year event-free survival estimate (55% +/- 11%) and probability of leukemic recurrence (38% +/- 11%) attained with this new regimen in recipients of autografts in first remission of AML are promising and challenge comparisons with preparative regimens employing combinations of cytotoxic agents or total body irradiation (TBI).\r"

  ".U": "90001532\r", 
  ".W": "Mice homozygous for an autosomal recessive scid (severe combined immune deficiency) mutation on chromosome 16 exhibit a defect that specifically impairs lymphoid differentiation but not myelopoiesis. Consequently such mice are deficient in both humoral and cell-mediated immune functions. Despite their defect, scid mice survive under pathogen-free conditions and are fertile. The mutation does not impair the hematopoietic microenvironment necessary for lymphoid differentiation, since these mice can be cured with grafts of normal bone marrow (BM) or cells from long-term BM cultures (LTBMC); however, reconstitution requires sublethal (400 cGy) irradiation of recipients. Engraftment with cells from LTBMC gave near-normal levels of colony-forming B cells (CFU-B) in spleen and BM of the recipients by 6 weeks postgrafting. Since LTBMC are devoid of all mature B and pre-B cells but contain stem cells that restore lymphoid function in scid mice, we used a limiting-dilution assay to characterize and enumerate the number of stem cells in LTBMC capable of restoring lymphoid function. Curing was determined by the CFU-B-cell assay, since CFU-B are not detectable in normal scid mice. The results indicate that fewer cells from LTBMC than from fresh BM are required to obtain lymphoid reconstitution. As few as 10(3) LTBMC cells can repopulate significant B- and T-cell function in scid recipients. From these results we conclude that scid mice can be used as recipients to quantify lymphoid-restricted stem cells and that there is a functional separation of lymphoid- and myeloid-restricted stem cells in LTBMC with an enrichment for lymphoid-restricted stem cells in these cultures.\r"

Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that specifically neutralizes mouse IL-6 but not human IL-6 inhibited megakaryocyte development in cells cultured either with or without the addition of mouse IL-6 but did not inhibit megakaryocyte development induced by human IL-6. This MoAb to mouse IL-6 that does not neutralize mouse IL-3 also inhibited mouse IL-3-induced megakaryocyte development. Antibody to mouse GM-CSF did not inhibit the formation of megakaryocytes. The results show that the induction of megakaryocyte development by IL-3 is due to the production of IL-6 in the BM cultures. The present experiments demonstrate a new property of IL-6 and indicate that IL-6 is a regulatory protein of normal megakaryocyte development.\r"

Electrophoretic pattern of hemoglobin was used as a marker of donor-type erythrocytes, giant granules of bgJ/bgJ mice as a marker of donor-type neutrophils, and A-type phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK-1) as a marker of hematopoietic colonies produced by donor-derived progenitor cells. Repopulation of donor-type erythrocytes was significantly faster than that of donor-type neutrophils. Moreover, the extent of replacement was greater for erythroid progenitor cells than for nonerythroid progenitor cells. When nonirradiated WBB6F1-W/Wv mice with B-type PGK-1 received 10(5) bone marrow cells from C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ;Pgk-1a donors, only approximately 20% replacement of erythroid progenitor cells gave rise to total reconstitution of erythrocytes. The present result suggests that normal multipotential stem cells may preferentially differentiate into erythroid lineage cells in anemic WBB6F1-W/Wv hosts and that normal erythroid progenitor cells may suppress the differentiation of erythroid progenitors of WBB6F1-W/Wv hosts.\r"

The 3T3 fibroblast cell lines derived from WCB6F1-+/+ mouse embryos supported the proliferation of cultured mast cells (CMC), whereas the 3T3 fibroblast cell lines from WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mouse embryos did not. To investigate the relationship between growth factor-dependent and fibroblast-dependent growths of mast cells, we cocultured CMC and 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of diffusible growth factors. WCB6F1-+/+ mouse embryo-derived 3T3 cells did not affect the growth factor-dependent proliferation of CMC, but WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mouse embryo-derived 3T3 cells significantly suppressed the proliferation. Close cell-to-cell contact was necessary for the suppression. The NWS1 fibroblast cell line was established from the spleen cells of an adult WBB6F1-+/+ mouse. Although the NWS1 cell line had no supporting effect on the proliferation of CMC in the absence of diffusible growth factors, it did not suppress the proliferation of CMC induced by the growth factors. The present result suggests that a product of mutant Sl genes may be involved in the suppressive activity of WCB6F1-Sl/Sld mouse embryo-derived 3T3 cells.\r"

  ".W": "To develop a purification strategy for isolating the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells present in normal human marrow we have combined cell separation techniques with an assay for cells that initiate sustained hematopoiesis in vitro in the presence of irradiated human marrow adherent cells. These \"feeders\" were established by subculturing 2- to 6-week-old primary long-term marrow culture adherent layers at a density of 3 x 10(4) irradiated cells per square centimeter. Test \"long-term culture (LTC)-initiating cells\" were plated on top of the feeders and the cocultures then maintained as standard long-term marrow cultures with half-media changes and removal of half of the nonadherent cells each week. The total number of myeloid, erythroid, and multilineage clonogenic progenitors present after 5 weeks was used to provide a quantitative assessment of the number of LTC-initiating cells originally added. Using this assay, the density, light scatter, and two cell surface antigen properties of LTC-initiating cells have been defined and compared with cells capable of directly forming colonies in methylcellulose. While the majority of the clonogenic cells were found in the high forward light scatter (FLS) \"blast\" window, LTC-initiating cells had significantly lower FLS properties and in this respect were more similar to lymphocytes. LTC-initiating cells also expressed less HLA-DR antigen than clonogenic cells. The majority of LTC-initiating cells were found in the top 2% of the CD34 (My10) fluorescence profile, whereas clonogenic cells were found throughout the top 5% of the CD34 fluorescence profile. By combining low FLS, low orthogonal light scatter (OLS), low HLA-DR expression, and high CD34 expression, a population could be obtained that was enriched for LTC-initiating cells approximately 800-fold over unseparated marrow. This population contains only 0.06% of the marrow cells and 2% of the total clonogenic cells, but retains 50% to 60% of the LTC-initiating cells present in the original marrow. The ability to purify these two populations independently shows that the LTC and clonogenic assays identify distinct, although not necessarily nonoverlapping cell types in human marrow. Since clonogenic cells are derived from LTC-initiating cells, the LTC assay clearly detects a more primitive population. The availability of a simple approach that allows the purification of such cells by three orders of magnitude in high yield should be useful for the investigation of early events in hematopoiesis as well as for the definitive isolation of human hematopoietic stem cells with long-term in vivo repopulating potential.\r"

The effect of these treatments was assessed by serial bone marrow cultures and by measuring HbF production in the progeny of bone marrow progenitors and in peripheral-blood reticulocytes. Administration of IL-3 alone to hematologically normal or anemic baboons produced an early increase in erythroid colony-forming units (CFUe) and erythroid clusters (e-clusters) with an increase in reticulocyte counts and a late increment in the relative frequency of erythroid burst-forming units (BFUe). In parallel to the increase in peripheral-blood reticulocytes, IL-3 increased the frequency of F reticulocytes in the normal and anemic animals. When administration of IL-3 was followed by administration of Epo, expansion in all classes of erythroid progenitors and increase in reticulocytes occurred, beyond the levels observed when the animals were treated with Epo alone. The combination of IL-3 and Epo, however, did not increase consistently the rate of F reticulocytes beyond the level induced by Epo alone. These results suggest that IL-3 enhances the effect of Epo on erythropoiesis, but the combination of the two growth factors does not lead to a preferential and significant enhancement of HbF production.\r"

We investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of DS in humans. DS was injected in single bolus intravenous injections of four increasing doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mg/kg) to six healthy volunteers. The resulting anticoagulant activities were assessed by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the thrombin clotting time (TCT). There were dose-dependent prolongations of the APTT and TCT, and the anticoagulant activities disappeared in less than three hours. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the plasma concentrations of DS measured with a new chromogenic assay. The volume of distribution was approximately 1.8 times greater than the theoretical plasma volume and was independent of dose. In contrast, the clearance decreased with dose and the terminal half-life ranged from 0.45 +/- 0.08 hours at 0.5 mg/kg to 0.72 +/- 0.11 hours (mean +/- SD) at 2 mg/kg. The bioavailabilities of subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration relative to those of intravenous administration were determined in 12 other volunteers. The respective bioavailabilities were 24.7% +/- 12.9% and 12.4% +/- 9.2% for SC and IM administration. There was no detectable change in the APTT and the TCT when the volunteers were injected with 1.5 mg/kg SC or IM. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentrations of DS showed considerable interindividual variations by the two later routes of administration. Peak concentrations were noted 2.7 +/- 1.3 hours after SC injection and 4.3 +/- 4.9 hours after IM injection. The average peak concentrations were 0.7 +/- 0.3 and 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg/L after SC and IM injections, respectively. The half-lives of DS were 7.9 +/- 6.5 hours (SC) and 6.3 +/- 7.4 hours (IM). No adverse reaction to DS was recorded during this study.\r"

Kinetic parameters of the factor X activating reaction were determined by functional titrations of factors VII and X with macrophage tissue factor (TF) added. We found rapid activation of factor X to Xa on alveolar macrophage surfaces. Detection of rapid factor Xa formation on macrophages required addition of exogenous factors VII and X. At plasma concentrations of the purified factors, factor Xa was formed on freshly isolated macrophages at approximately 5.4 pmol/min/10(6) cells. After macrophage maturation in culture for 20 hours with LPS (endotoxin) added, the factor X activation rate was increased two- to sixfold. The km' (apparent km) of TF-factor VII enzymatic complexes assembled on alveolar macrophages for factor X were (258 +/- 55 and 475 +/- 264 nmol/L for human and rabbit cells, respectively). The km' did not change during macrophage maturation in culture, but V'max (apparent Vmax) was consistently increased. The K1/2 of human factor VII (concentrations giving half maximal rates of factor X activation) for the interaction with human and rabbit alveolar macrophage TF were 0.191 +/- 0.096 and 1.7 +/- 0.7 etamol/L, respectively. The K1/2 were not significantly changed after maturation, whereas rates of Xa formation at saturation with factor VII were increased. The fast rates of factor X activation observed at physiologic concentrations of plasma-derived factors VII and X indicate that TF on alveolar macrophages is likely to provide sites for binding of factor VII and activation of factor X in vivo during clotting reactions associated with alveolar edema and inflammation.\r"

In contrast, the pathogenetic mechanism in acute and chronic ITP in children is not known. In this report, we studied 39 children with destructive thrombocytopenia, 15 patients with acute ITP and 24 patients with chronic ITP. Platelet autoantibodies to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa were detected in 14 of 24 patients (58.3%) in the chronic ITP group and in four of 15 (26.7%) with acute ITP. Binding ratios (+/- SD) of positive patients were significantly greater (P = .01) in chronic ITP (8.0 +/- 9.1) when compared with those of acute ITP where the binding ratios were only slightly above the normal range (1.9 +/- 0.4). The results show that autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins are present in the majority of children with chronic ITP confirming the autoimmune nature of this disorder. The minimal elevation seen in the positive children with acute ITP suggests a different pathogenetic mechanism. These data suggest that this approach may be useful in differentiating acute from chronic ITP patients.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrin is a hallmark of immune-mediated tissue lesions. The presence of fibrin in such lesions implies both the formation of fibrin via coagulation and the accompanying restriction of fibrinolysis, allowing fibrin to persist. Previous work has shown that human monocytes exposed to an inflammatory stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produce both tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor--type 2 (PAI-2). These two proteins favor fibrin deposition, and evidence implies that cellular production of these two molecules may be linked. Another proinflammatory process pertinent to immune-mediated tissue damage and fibrin deposition is the response to alloantigen. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBM), consisting of lymphocytes and monocytes together, responded to alloantigen stimulation with differential expression of TF and PAI-2. PBM exposed to alloantigen developed high levels of TF activity, with no concomitant increase in PAI-2 activity or antigen. Alloantigen-stimulated PBM did not accumulate intracellular PAI-2, nor did they degrade PAI-2 added to cultures. This lack of PAI-2 production was not due to inadequate stimulation, as tritiated thymidine uptake and TF production demonstrated recognition of, and a vigorous reaction to, alloantigen. The divergent TF and PAI-2 responses of PBM exposed to alloantigen was maintained over 5 days and was reflected by mRNA profiles. These results imply that under specific physiologically relevant conditions, the procoagulant and antifibrinolytic effectors of inflammatory mononuclear cells can be independently regulated. This would imply more flexibility to monocyte mechanisms that favor fibrin deposition than previously thought.\r"

T-PLL cells expressed the phenotype CD1- CD3+ CD4+ CD8+. Incubation with the differentiating agent phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate markedly increased the percentage of cells with the CD4- CD8+ phenotype, suggesting that leukemic cells were already committed towards a differentiated element with the CD4- CD8+ phenotype. T-PLL cells were induced to proliferate by anti-CD2 MoAb 9-1 + 9.6 and by anti-CD3 MoAb OKT3. The two pathways exhibited normal functional interactions and were susceptible to modulation by anti-HLA class I MoAbs. These results indicate that regulation of cell proliferation was preserved to a significant extent in the T-PLL cells analyzed. At variance with normal resting T cells that require previous activation to proliferate when incubated with interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-2 (IL-2), T-PLL cells proliferated vigorously when incubated with either interleukin. Furthermore, T-PLL cells proliferated when incubated with immune interferon (IFN-gamma). The latter finding parallels the enhancement by IFN-gamma of the proliferative response of lectin-activated murine T lymphocytes. These results suggest that T-PLL cells, which express a high constitutive level of c-myc mRNA, may be in an activated state. The antigenic phenotype and the characteristics of the proliferative pathways of T-PLL cells from the patient TRT are compatible with the possibility that they may be derived from an intermediate thymocyte.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type II (HTLV-II) infection and its rate of spread have been difficult to determine owing to the serological cross-reactivity between HTLV-I and HTLV-II. The present study overcame this problem by directly detecting type-specific proviral sequences by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and liquid hybridization. Screening was performed on a cohort of primarily white intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs), and individuals of other behaviorally defined risk groups from the New York City area. Eleven percent (19 of 169) of the individuals in these high-risk groups were determined by PCR to have HTLV-II proviral infections. One of these patients displayed an exfoliative erythrodermatitis. Thirteen of the 19 subjects were positive in an HTLV-II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining six individuals, although negative in the HTLV-II ELISA, were confirmed as HTLV-II positive by analyzing their DNA with a second HTLV-II-specific primer detector system. Four additional individuals were reactive in the HTLV-II ELISA but were PCR-negative for HTLV-II. PCR analysis for HTLV-I revealed that all four were positive for that virus. Thirty-seven percent (seven of 19) of the HTLV-II PCR-positive subjects were also PCR-positive for HTLV-I, and 84% (16 of 19) of the HTLV-II positive individuals were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Six individuals were triply infected with HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HIV-1.\r"

  ".W": "Activation and expansion in culture with rIL-2 of peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) specimens derived from children with ALL and ANLL, with active disease (AP) and in remission were studied (RP). Baseline NK cytolytic activity from AP was found to be depressed, whereas RP-derived cells had normal NK activity, as assayed against K562 targets. Culture in rIL-2 significantly enhanced the NK activity of both AP- and RP-derived cells and generated LAK activity, as assayed by 4-hour 51Cr release, against NK-resistant Raji cell line and against fresh, allogeneic, and autologous tumor cells. Lytic activity against fresh, cryopreserved leukemia blasts was of lower than that found against cell lines. In three patients higher lytic activity against autologous than against allogeneic blasts was demonstrated. Expansion in culture with rIL-2 varied from twofold to 120-fold. rIL-2 activation and expansion was better in RP than in AP. The predominant phenotype of activated cells, as determined by flow cytometry, was [mean % (SD)]: CD3- = 54 (12), CD8+ = 55 (17), and NKH1+ = 26 (7). The consistently high level of CD8+ cells was accompanied by very low levels of CD4+ cells: mean = 11% (14). Double-marker analysis showed mean of 33% (10) for CD3+/NKH1+ cells and mean = 32 (11) for CD8+/NKH1+ cells, implying that these populations were overlapping. Kinetics of expression of cell surface markers during 2 to 3 weeks in culture showed that CD8+ and NKH1+ enrichment occurred during the first week and lasted for up to 4 weeks, whereas CD4+ expression decreased after the second week. A significant decrease in the expression of IL-2 receptors (CD25) was observed from the second week of culture. This study shows the feasibility of in vitro generation of killer cells from PB and BM of pediatric leukemia patients.\r"

  ".U": "90001555\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is likely to be an important mediator of the inflammatory response. We measured levels of this cytokine in plasma samples from 37 patients with sepsis or septic shock obtained at the time of admission to the intensive care unit and related these levels to hemodynamic and biochemical parameters as well as to clinical outcome. In 32 of the 37 patients, increased levels of IL-6 were found, occasionally up to 7,500 times the normal level. The highest IL-6 levels were encountered in patients who suffered from septic shock (P value of the difference between patients with and without shock less than .0001). In addition, IL-6 significantly correlated with plasma lactate (P less than .0001), heart rate (P = .05) and, inversely, with mean arterial pressure (P = .01) and platelet counts (P = .0002). Significant correlations of IL-6 with the anaphylatoxins C3a (P = .0001) and C4a (P = .0002) and with the main inhibitor of the classical pathway of complement, C1-inhibitor (inverse correlation, P = .05), were also observed. IL-6 on admission appeared to be of prognostic significance: levels were higher in septic patients who subsequently died than in those who survived (P = .0003), in particular when only patients with septic shock were considered (P less than .0001). All nine septic patients with levels of less than 40 U/mL on admission survived, whereas 89% of the nine patients with levels exceeding 7,500 U/mL died. These data provide evidence for a role of IL-6 in the pathophysiology of septic shock. Further studies are needed to reveal whether IL-6 in sepsis is directly involved in mediating lethal complications or whether it is to be considered as an \"alarm hormone\" that reflects endothelial cell injury probably mediated by the anaphylatoxines.\r"

  ".W": "Latent transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta) are easily detectable in embryonic and adult hematopoietic tissues and in vitro studies show that they are potent antagonists of lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis when converted to biologically active form. To learn more about possible roles in hematopoiesis, active TGF-beta 1 was added to cultures prepared to support myeloid cells (Dexter conditions) or B lineage lymphocytes (Whitlock-Witte conditions) and studied in detail. Hematopoiesis was permanently arrested in Dexter cultures treated with 40 pmol/L (1 ng/mL) of active TGF-beta from initiation. In addition, adipogenesis was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and adherent layers from treated cultures were defective when recharged with fresh bone marrow cells. Ongoing neutrophil production was terminated in established cultures when addition of the factor was delayed for 8 weeks. In contrast, in experiments with Whitlock-Witte cultures, some of the flasks produced lymphocytes in the continuous presence of TGF-beta 1 (40 pmol/L). Lymphopoiesis was completely arrested by ten-fold higher concentrations, and this was most effective when added at the beginning of culture. Precursors of lymphocytes as well as the microenvironmental elements necessary for supporting their growth survived 2 weeks of cytokine treatment (400 pmol/L) in Dexter cultures. Normal outgrowth of lymphocytes occurred when the cultures were switched to Whitlock-Witte conditions. Surface marker expression on lymphocytes growing in TGF-beta resistant or previously treated cultures was not unusual. These studies demonstrate that TGF-beta is a negative regulator of hematopoiesis in long-term cultures and show that this includes effects on microenvironmental elements. At low concentrations, production of myeloid cells was preferentially affected.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) on in vitro proliferation and M-protein secretion in human myeloma cells were investigated. Human myeloma cells were purified from bone marrow aspirates in 12 multiple myeloma patients. Purified myeloma cells were cultured for 48 hours with IFN alpha at its lower concentrations (0.1 to 100 U/mL). The cells were then pulsed with 3H-TdR for the last 12 hours and 3H-TdR uptake was measured (in vitro proliferation). After 48-hour culture, supernatants were harvested and the amount of M-protein in these fluids were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (in vitro M-protein secretion). In vitro M-protein secretions of myeloma cells were significantly suppressed even at 0.1 U/mL of IFN alpha, while 3H-TdR uptakes were not so suppressed until 10 or 100 U/mL of IFN alpha were added. The expressions of secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) mRNA of these myeloma cells were also selectively suppressed by IFN alpha. Furthermore, after IFN alpha had been administered intramuscularly, 3 to 6 x 10(6) U/d for at least 1 month, in vitro M-protein secretions of these myeloma cells were decreased compared with those before IFN alpha administration. Therefore, these results suggest that IFN alpha has more sensitive inhibitory effect on M-protein secretion of human myeloma cells rather than on myeloma cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Two human tumor cell lines exhibiting acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) with increased expression of a cell surface glycoprotein (GP-170) were tested for their sensitivity to human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF). The drug resistant mutant lines (CEM/V, a T-cell leukemia line resistant to vinblastine, and 8226/D, a multiple myeloma line resistant to doxorubicin), were markedly more sensitive to rTNF in clonogenic assay than were their drug-sensitive parental lines (CEM, 8226). As determined by radioreceptor assay, the number of cell surface receptors for rTNF did not differ on the parental and drug-resistant lines. During the first 24 hours after addition of rTNF, there was a decrease in intracellular ATP content in the CEM/V line but not in the CEM line. No differential effect of rTNF on ATP content was observed between 8226 and 8226/D. As determined by RNA dot-blot analysis, total cellular RNA for GP-170 was increased in the 8226/D cells. After rTNF exposure, expression of total cellular RNA for GP-170 was not altered. Accumulation of radiolabeled doxorubicin by 8226/D cells was not altered by previous or coincubation with rTNF. These findings suggest that the effects of rTNF on MDR cells is not related to TNF receptor number and is mediated at a step subsequent to rTNF binding and not by either inhibition of synthesis of GP-170 or by alteration in the function of the GP-170 efflux pump.\r"

  ".U": "90001559\r", 
  ".W": "Previously we showed that starvation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells for a single essential amino acid induced irreversible differentiation into more mature monocyte-like cells. Although not an essential amino acid, glutamine is important in the growth of normal and neoplastic cells. The glutamine analogue, alpha S,5S-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) inhibits several glutamine-utilizing enzymes and therefore depletes cells of certain metabolic end products. The current study was designed to examine in vitro the effects of acivicin on growth and differentiation of several established human myeloid leukemia cell lines, including the HL-60 cell line, and of freshly isolated cells from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Four-day culture of HL-60 cells with acivicin at concentrations of 0.1 to 10.0 micrograms/mL (0.56 to 56 nmol/L) decreased cell growth by 33% to 88% as compared with untreated control cells. Viability of cells was greater than 92% for untreated cells and 93% to 41% for acivicin-treated cells. Cells treated with acivicin differentiated along a monocytic pathway as shown by increased H2O2 production and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (NSE) content. Differentiation was time and dose dependent, and was irreversible. Changes in H2O2 production and NSE content were partially abrogated by co-culture with 10 mmol/L exogenous cytidine and guanosine but not by co-culture with other nucleosides or glutamine. At these concentrations of acivicin, differentiation was associated with expression of the N-formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-receptor (FMLP-R) on 8% to 29% of cells as compared with 8% for control cells. Acivicin potentiated the differentiating effects of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, dihydroxyvitamin D3, dimethylsulfoxide, and retinoic acid. Culture of cells from the U937 (monoblastic), K562 (erythroleukemia), and KG-1 (myeloblastic) cell lines resulted in decreased growth and viability, but not consistently in differentiation. Acivicin decreased survival of freshly isolated ANLL cells and increased their H2O2 production and NSE content. These results suggest that the glutamine analogue acivicin may be useful as a differentiating agent with antileukemia activity in patients with ANLL.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of negativity for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and absence of lineage-associated antigens on the cell surface, 11 children were diagnosed as having acute undifferentiated leukemia. To analyze the molecular events associated with hematopoietic cell differentiation, we analyzed the configuration of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) delta, alpha, gamma, and beta genes in these patients. In parallel, transcription of the genes for MPO, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), CD3-gamma, Ig-mu, TCR-gamma, and beta was also examined. Six patients showed rearrangements of both the Ig heavy (H) and TCR-delta genes, frequently accompanied with Ig-kappa, TCR-alpha, gamma, and beta gene rearrangements. These findings indicated that the leukemic cells from the six patients had been committed to the lymphoid lineage. This concept was supported by the presence of TdT transcripts in three analyzed specimens from these patients. In contrast, the remaining five patients did not display rearrangements of the Ig or TCR genes, and TdT transcripts were undetectable in two patients tested. MPO transcripts were not detected in four patients analyzed, thus providing no evidence of myeloid differentiation. After hybridization with the CD3-gamma gene, three of six patients showed transcription of the CD3-gamma gene. In addition to CD3-gamma transcripts, one patient with rearrangements of the Ig-H, TCR-delta, alpha, gamma, and beta genes also had full-length TCR-beta and gamma transcripts, indicating a T-precursor-cell origin of the leukemic cells from this patient. The Ig and TCR genes were in the germline configuration in the other two patients with CD3-gamma transcripts. One of them did not express the CD7 antigen but did express the CD33 antigen on the cell surface, suggesting that CD3-gamma transcription may not always be an event restricted to cells differentiating along the T-cell lineage.\r"

Two of these four patients had evidence of acute leukemia by criteria other than marrow involvement at the time of presentation: one patient had evidence of multifocal dermal involvement; and the other patient had a cytogenetic abnormality, t(8;21), found predominantly in acute leukemia. The fifth patient developed acute leukemia 2 years after initial presentation with greater than 30% peripheral blasts. Although our series of patients is small, it does suggest that patients who have greater than 30% peripheral blasts should be considered an acute leukemia, even with less than 30% marrow blasts.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the most important factors in the prognosis and staging of multiple myeloma (MM), the presenting clinical features of 163 previously untreated patients with MM were correlated with survival duration using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. The univariate proportional hazard analysis ranked the parameters in the following order of importance: platelet count, hemoglobin level (Hb), tumor cell mass stage, lytic bone lesions, creatinine, and age. When the individual contribution of each variable was assessed by multivariate regression analysis, platelet count was confirmed to be the dominant feature for prognosis and clinical stage provided additional information. The introduction of platelet count could then be used to improve the reliability of the Durie and Salmon staging, by allowing to separate the high-risk group (stages II and III) into a smaller subgroup (22%) of thrombocytopenic patients (less than 150 x 10(9) platelets/L) whose risk of death was actually very high (median survival, 9 months) and a larger subgroup (46%) of patients with normal platelet count and intermediate or standard risk (median survival, 48 months). This simple change in the prognostic system gave rise to markedly different survival curves also after the exclusion of patients with renal failure and applied successfully to both old and young patients (greater than and less than 50 years, respectively). Finally, platelet count, Hb, and lytic bone lesions could be combined simply to stratify patients with normal renal function into three risk groups: (1) low (39% of cases; median survival, 79 months), (2) intermediate (53% of cases; median survival, 48 months), and (3) high (8% of cases; median survival, 19 months).\r"

  ".W": "Cytologic and cytogenetic results obtained from patients fulfilling the FAB criteria for the diagnosis of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) of megakaryocytic lineage (ANLL-M7) are reported. Eleven cases were de novo ANLL-M7, of whom three presented with acute myelofibrosis. Four cases were megakaryoblastic transformations of chronic myelogenous leukemia (two cases), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (one case), and polycythemia vera (one case). Four patients showed a minority of granular blasts, with occasional Auer rods in one. Positive myeloperoxidase and/or sudan black-B stainings and CD13 positivity in these cases were consistent with the presence of a myeloid involvement. Morphologic evidence of associated myelodysplastic features was detected in all evaluable patients with de novo ANLL-M7. These cytologic findings indicate that ANLL-M7 may frequently represent a multilineage proliferation. Cytogenetic studies revealed -7/7q- and +8, alone or in combination with additional aberrations, in three cases each. Rearrangements involving bands 3q21 or 3q26 were seen in two patients and +21, as an additional aberration, in one. Other structural rearrangements all observed in a single patient were inv(16)(p13q22) at megakaryoblastic relapse with bone marrow eosinophilia, t(13;20)(q13 or 14;q11), del(20)(q11), and der(7)t(7;17)(p14;q22). Most breakpoints of these aberrations are located at bands frequently rearranged in malignant myeloid stem cell disorders. A review of 31 cases of the literature showed a frequent occurrence of -7/7q- and -5/5q- in ANLL-M7. Many of the chromosome aberrations so far described in ANLL-M7 appear to be shared by a spectrum of myeloid neoplasias and may be related to mechanisms conferring proliferative advantage to undifferentiated stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the production of reactive oxygen species and total superoxide dismutase activity have been observed during differentiation of some hematopoietic cells. We therefore investigated whether the steady-state level and rate of transcription of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) mRNA change during terminal differentiation of the human leukemia cell lines THP-1, HEL, and HL-60 into macrophages and/or granulocytes, respectively. Macrophage differentiation is accompanied by a gradual decrease in both the transcription rate (10x) and the steady-state level (6x) of SOD-1 mRNA. No decrease was observed after treatment with the diacylglycerol analog 1,2 dioctanol-rac-glycerol (di-C8), which like phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also activates protein kinase C but does not induce differentiation at the concentration used. The same decrease in SOD-1 mRNA level was observed when HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes by treatment with dimethylsulfoxide. These data suggest that a decrease in SOD-1 mRNA to almost undetectable levels accompanies differentiation of macrophages and granulocytes.\r"

  ".W": "An atypical sickle cell trait with a very low level of hemoglobin S and features of heterozygous beta-thalassemia was recently described. In vitro globin chain synthesis strongly suggested the presence of the two abnormalities on the same chromosome. We report the corresponding beta S-thal gene. DNA sequence revealed a C----T base substitution in the distal promoter element CACCC, at position-88 from the cap site, in addition to the expected GAG----GTG mutation responsible for the structural variant (beta 6 Glu----Val). Reticulocyte mRNA titration and transient assay of the mutant gene in COS cells showed a defect in beta-mRNA production. Restriction haplotype and DNA sequence analyses revealed that the doubly mutated gene is associated with haplotype 19 (or Benin/Algeria haplotype). In particular, we found the (AT)9(T)4 repeated sequences specifically encountered 5' to the beta S gene of Benin Algeria type. These results support the view that the beta S-thal gene resulted from an independent thalassemic mutation having occurred on a beta S chromosome rather than (a) from a beta S mutation having altered a beta-thalassemic gene or (b) from a recombination event between two chromosomes, each carrying one of the mutations.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that circulating hemoglobin (Hb) CC erythrocytes contain oxygenated HbC crystals with little or no HbF and that HbF inhibits in vitro crystallization of HbC. We now report that HbS accelerates in vitro crystallization of HbC. Crystals were formed in 1.8 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30 degrees C and were counted in several time intervals with a hematocytometer. The hemoglobin composition of Millipore-isolated crystals and supernatant were also analyzed. Under the conditions selected, 100% HbS formed needle-shaped crystals only after two hours. Pure HbC does not form crystals within 15 minutes, whereas a ratio of 10% HbS:90% HbC forms 1,100 crystals/mm3, 20% HbS:80% HbC forms 370 crystals/mm3, and 30% HbS:70% HbC forms 5 crystals/mm3. Crystals formed in the presence of HbS are tetragonal, as are pure HbC crystals. As compared with 100% HbC, HbA or albumin mixed with HbC showed a decreased number of crystals as a result of dilution. Analysis of the Hb content of isolated crystals by citrate agar gel electrophoresis showed that HbS was rapidly incorporated into the crystal in the same ratio over time. These results demonstrate that HbS accelerates crystallization of HbC with respect to the rates of crystallization of any of these two Hbs separately, through a mechanism that involves cocrystallization. These results may be significant in understanding SC disease.\r"

  ".W": "The rare McLeod blood group phenotype is characterized by weak Kell antigens, lack of the common Kx antigen, and acanthocytic morphology. Previous studies that did not detect membrane or cytoskeletal protein abnormalities suggested a lipid disturbance. In normal red cells, dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) is transported across the membrane by an enzymatic process and accumulates in the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer causing discocyte to stomatocyte shape changes. Scanning electron microscopy of McLeod red cells shows a mixture comprised of 15% discocytes, 51% with irregular surfaces, and 34% acanthocytes. On incubation with various concentrations of DMPS at 37 degrees C for periods up to two hours, McLeod red cells transported DMPS across the membrane and caused irregularly shaped and acanthocytic McLeod red cells to attain normal discocyte shape and later to become stomatocytes. Chlorpromazine, which at 0 degrees C preferentially partitions into the inner monolayer of the membrane, had a similar effect on the shape of McLeod red cells. This suggests that in McLeod cells acanthocytosis is due to a lack of lipid in the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer but that the imbalance is not caused by defective transport of phosphatidylserine across the membrane.\r"

Lysosomal activities, normally found in the same pellet, are excluded from the transferrin receptor-containing exosomes, suggesting that there is a common mechanism to segregate and externalize specific plasma membrane proteins. In addition to the sheep, electron micrographic studies show that exosomes can be retrieved from the circulation of anemic pigs, rats, and rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-five percent of untransfused and 70% of transfused patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) are cured with bone marrow transplants from histocompatible sibling donors. Use of partially matched family donors or unrelated donors has been relatively unsuccessful because of high incidences of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thirteen children with SAA received marrow grafts from alternative donors (sibling 4, parent 5, unrelated 4). The first three patients were pretreated with cyclophosphamide (CYCLO) +/- irradiation and received methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. Subsequent children were pretreated with CYCLO + high-dose cytosine arabinoside + methylprednisolone + total body irradiation, had monoclonal antibody T-cell depletion of the donor marrow, and received cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis. Three heavily transfused patients with haploidentical-related donors failed to engraft and died. All 10 patients with more closely matched donors engrafted. Acute GVHD was grade II in only one patient (non-T-depleted); this patient is the only one with severe chronic GVHD. Three engrafted patients died (Pneumocystis pneumonia, systemic parainfluenza, venocclusive disease). Seven children are alive 33+ to 2,692+ days. Donors for the survivors were siblings 3, parent 1, unrelated 3. These data suggest that bone marrow transplantation from closely matched donors other than histocompatible siblings can be effective therapy for SAA if an intensive conditioning regimen is used. These results must be confirmed with larger numbers and longer follow-up.\r"

This analysis revealed a significantly higher frequency of DQw7 containing haplotypes in DR4 positive rheumatoid patients (64%) than in DR-matched healthy controls (42%).

There was a good positive predictive value (70%) between aCL and overall disease activity, but not for individual systems. A strong association between aCL and renal involvement irrespective of activity was also found (80%). Nine SLE patients fulfilled both the clinical and serological criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and a further 18 patients fulfilled the serological criteria for APS.

Using a well characterized antiserum (R 102M) we have assayed serum and synovial fluid samples from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related levels to serological and radiological markers of disease. There were 21 patients with RA (mean age 58.2 years, 15 F) and 33 with OA (mean age 69.2, 28 F). Paired serum and synovial fluids (SF) were available in 19 RA patients and 30 OA patients. Serum osteocalcin levels were related to age-/sex-matched normals and to a small group of elderly disease controls. Serum levels tended to be lower in RA than controls, but not significantly so: RA 5.56 (3.67); control 6.09 (2.54) ng/ml; expressed as mean (SD) and the mean serum/SF ratio was 0.88 (0.86). The results were much more variable in OA (mean serum osteocalcin 6.1 (3.9]. Elevated levels were mainly due to a small number of patients with a destructive form of OA and were higher than those with non-destructive OA (10.3 (3.5), n = 20, versus 3.83 (1.6), n = 10). Patients with non-destructive OA had a lower serum osteocalcin than age-/sex-matched normals. In this study, synovial fluid levels were usually less than serum concentrations, but in two RA and four OA patients the ratio was reversed, suggesting local production. Osteocalcin may be an important marker of bone activity in OA.\r"

In most patients the macrocytosis was noted during the first 6 months but did occur in the second and third 6-month period of treatment. Only one patient (0.8%) developed neutropenia and no cases of thrombocytopenia were observed. Regular blood counts should be performed while patients remain on treatment but haematological side-effects are seldom the reason for withdrawal of sulphasalazine.\r"

The present in vitro study of PHA-stimulated human T-lymphocytes showed that CPH 82 arrested cell division in a metaphase-like configuration. The cell cycle effects of CPH 82 were indistinguishable from the cell cycle effects of the classical microtubule depolymerizers, Colcemid (a colchicine derivative) and podophyllotoxin. A CPH 82 concentration of 1 microgram/ml, which is close to therapeutic serum concentrations, had an almost maximal effect on cell division. It is suggested that at least part of the anti-inflammatory effect of CPH 82 is due to a colchicine-like activity on, for example, proliferating lymphocytes.\r"

Our results showed treatment with ticlopidine significantly (p less than 0.01) improved both the ESR (-28%) and the whole blood filterability rate (-15%), pain (-24%), and morning stiffness (-28%). These clinical benefits correlated with improvement in the whole blood filterability rate. Clinical benefits may have resulted from improved perfusion and transport of NSAID to target tissues.\r"

This produces major problems in delineating the tumour as well as verifying that vital structures such as the spinal cord are not included in the target volume. The use of computed tomography (CT) generally overcomes some of these problems and we have developed an algorithm to reconstruct transverse CT images into the appropriate oblique plane. Software has been written on the Picker Independent Treatment Planning System (ITPS) to allow planning on central axis and off-axis oblique planes. In addition we have used a beam's eye view facility to aid in the verification process.\r"

Two-phase bone scintigraphy, using 600 MBq of 99Tcm-HMDP, and perfusion and late-phase nanocolloid scintigraphy, using 370 MBq of 99Tcm-nanocolloid, were performed on each patient. In both methods, photon deficiency at the site of interest was taken to indicate avascularity. The perfusion phase of both methods was found to be unhelpful. Agreement between methods was obtained in 18 patients (95%). Six patients had abnormal nanocolloid scans, one of which was normal on the conventional bone scintigram. The remaining 13 patients had no evidence to suggest avascularity in either method. Three of the patients with abnormal scans have had hip replacement surgery following which avascularity of the femoral head was confirmed. 99Tcm-nanocolloid scintigraphy is thus shown to be a very sensitive method of demonstrating avascularity of bone following trauma.\r"

The diagnosis was made by rectosigmoidoscopy in all patients. The limitations and pitfalls of both examinations were studied. The mean interval between radiotherapy and diagnosis was 1.7 years and the mean follow-up period was 3.5 years. The main radiological features varied from normal findings (15% of the initial examinations) to decreased distensibility of the bowel wall, intestinal fixation, mucosal and contour abnormalities, ulceration, stenoses and fistula formation. During follow-up, the number of all pathological findings increased. Pre-stenotic dilatation of the descending colon was always absent. The contrast enema examinations and endoscopies were found to be complementary. The barium enema showed the extent of the disease and accurately identified stenoses and fistulas, but underdiagnosed ulceration and overdiagnosed malignancy. Endoscopy allowed unequivocal detection of mucosal damage, especially ulceration, and was accurate in showing stenoses but sometimes failed to demonstrate fistulas. Moreover, in 25% of examinations it was impossible to examine the entire abnormal area.\r"

Three types of image were constructed using computer graphics: disc-shaped targets of variable radius, model chest radiographs showing a variable heart diameter and model arterial angiograms with variable vessel width. Five factors were investigated: observer experience, variation of detectability with theoretical signal-to-noise ratio, the prior probability of the presence of an abnormality, viewing distance, and uncertainty in the location of an abnormality. In all but one experiment, excellent agreement was found between measured detectabilities and the predictions of signal detection theory, providing an initial practice session was included for each observer. No significant variation in detectability was found using six different prior probabilities and two different viewing distances, and the reduction in detectability for a four-alternative location task was in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The high statistical efficiencies found for the detection of geometrical signals suggest that the levels of observer \"internal\" noise arising from decision-making processes during an ROC experiment are very low.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the mechanical properties of pig skin have been studied in vivo, using a dermal extensometer, after irradiation with a single dose of 18 Gy of X rays. There was no significant change in the stiffness of irradiated skin, when compared with unirradiated skin, until 9 weeks after irradiation when the irradiated skin was significantly stiffer. This effect was also found at 12 and 15 weeks after irradiation. When the increase in skin thickness, as a consequence of oedema, was taken into account a significant increase in the unrelaxed elastic modulus of irradiated skin was only seen at 12 and 15 weeks after irradiation. There were no significant changes in force relaxation, after extension of the skin, over this time period. After the resolution of oedema, which was associated with a significant 20% reduction in the thickness of irradiated skin relative to unirradiated skin, the mechanical properties of irradiated skin were not markedly different from those of unirradiated skin. However, between 30 and 39 weeks after irradiation there was a further wave of dermal thinning, resulting in a total reduction in the thickness of irradiated skin relative to unirradiated skin of 26%. This was associated with a rapid rise in the skin stiffness and unrelaxed elastic modulus by approximately 65 and approximately 140%, respectively. It was only at these late times after irradiation that the force relaxation of the skin was modified significantly. At 9 and 12 weeks after irradiation the reduction in skin stiffness and the unrelaxed elastic modulus were dose related. Based on the percentage of fields showing a significant reduction in these biomechanical parameters, ED50 values of between 12 and 14.5 Gy were established. This would appear to be a sensitive method for assessing radiation-induced dermal changes since few gross changes are observed in this dose range.\r"

Thermoluminescent dosemeter chips and discs were calibrated and used for all measurements in the primary and scattered radiation fields. Skin doses as well as mean doses received by the thyroid, lung, lens of the eye, breast, uterus and the ovaries were measured. A 30 degree right anterior oblique (RAO) cardiac DSA study produces a beam entrance dose of about 121 mGy at a rate of 0.48 mGy/frame. The highest mean organ dose from cardiac DSA was to the lung with a value of 14.4 mGy. The rest of the organs received doses below 1 mGy. In carotid DSA, the mean entrance doses resulted from the RAO, left anterior oblique, and the Towne's view projections give an average of 168 mGy at a rate of 8.4 mGy/frame. The highest mean organ dose from the three projections, 21 mGy, was received by the thyroid. The uterus and ovaries received the lowest doses from both procedures with values below 0.04 mGy. Patient and phantom surface exposures were compared using an exposure area product system. Hence, exposure conditions used for measuring organ doses on the phantom were adjusted to resemble those used for patients.\r"

Sixteen swine, evenly divided into four groups, underwent BESWL. One group had one BESWL session targeted on the gallbladder and another group had two BESWL sessions targeted on the gallbladder. The third group had one BESWL session targeted on implanted gallbladder stones and the fourth group had one BESWL session targeted on the region of the common bile duct (CBD). Half of each group were sacrificed on the day of lithotripsy and half 1 week later. Post-mortem examinations were performed. Each implanted gallstone had fragmented. There were no findings attributable to BESWL in 11 animals. Three animals had pulmonary haemorrhagic spots (the largest was 10 mm in diameter) and one had a submucosal CBD petechia; these findings were attributable to BESWL. In two animals, microscopic haemorrhage associated with bronchopneumonia (usually present in our pig population) was more prominent than usual. This was possibly attributable to BESWL. The swine's deep posterior costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to avoid the lung base during BESWL in swine. We conclude that this BESWL device can fragment gallstones without causing clinically significant soft-tissue damage.\r"

Sixty-seven patients received induction chemotherapy. Actuarial survival of the entire group at 3 and 5 years was 25 and 23%, respectively, and 3-year actuarial survival rates for T1, T2, T3 and T4 lesions were 42, 48, 20 and 17%, respectively. The local control rate at the primary site was 55% and 78% in the neck. Distant metastases occurred in 10% of patients and 8% had a second primary. Nodal status was the only other prognostic factor. The local control rate obtained with irradiation alone was not good. For limited T1 and T2 tumours, interstitial therapy or surgery should improve the local control rate.\r"

The result has been an effective method to achieve fairness in the selection of postgraduate trainees for participating Canadian specialty programs.\r"

Significant differences in the probability of dying were found between those with and without diabetes mellitus, between those who had received a renal transplant and those who had not, between white and nonwhite patients and between various age groups. The mortality rates of the ESRD patients were at least three times higher than those of the general Canadian population. Primary diagnosis and treatment were significantly associated with the risk of dying among the ESRD patients. For those who had received a transplant, the length of time spent waiting for a transplant was positively associated with the risk of death from ESRD. Patients who had received peritoneal dialysis before transplantation had a higher risk of death than those who had received either hemodialysis (risk ratio 1.3) or transplantation (risk ratio 3.2) as the first treatment. No significant differences were found in the cause of death between those who had received peritoneal dialysis and those who had received hemodialysis. Almost half of the deaths among women without diabetes who had received a transplant were due to infection.\r"

We undertook a large epidemiologic study of the current health status and the selected morbidity rates among 2152 people in the exposed area. We established two comparison groups: one was a demographically similar unexposed population and the other a demographically different group also exposed to sour gas emissions in another region. The methods included a cross-sectional survey of current residents and separate historical cohort studies involving registry linkage to investigate cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. The cross-sectional survey involved a comprehensive health questionnaire, standardized clinical examinations by physicians blinded to the subjects' symptoms and concerns, and several laboratory tests. We were able to contact just under 60% of the people who we knew had moved from each area since 1958 and found no evidence of selective migration for health reasons. Although the residents of the exposed area reported an excess number of symptoms and health problems there were no significant differences in the mortality rate, incidence of cancer, reproductive problems, major ailments, hair levels of arsenic and certain metals or respiratory function between the groups.\r"

  ".W": "There is ample evidence of the value of intensive therapeutic strategies in the management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the commonest form of malignant disease in children. Such a program, devised at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston, and incorporating high-dose L-asparaginase, was adopted in 1984 by the Children's Hospital at Chedoke-McMaster, Hamilton, Ont., and the Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, London. We describe the experience of these institutions in the treatment of 82 children with ALL, 19 of whom were switched to the DFCI protocols while in continuing first remission with other treatment programs to complete a minimum of 2 years of maintenance therapy; the remaining 63 children, who had recently diagnosed disease, were consecutively enrolled in the DFCI protocols. Each child was assigned at diagnosis to a category of risk for relapse and treated accordingly. There were no remission induction failures or deaths due to induction therapy among the patients with newly diagnosed disease. There were no differences in total or event-free survival rates between the patients in Hamilton and those in London or between those whose protocols were switched and those who were treated from the beginning with the DFCI protocols. With a median follow-up interval of 144 weeks the total survival rate was 95% and the event-free survival rate 88%. For patients at standard risk of relapse the event-free survival rate was 100%, for those at high risk the rate was 82%, and for those at very high risk the rate was 67%. If infants (all of whom suffered a relapse) are excluded from the last category the rate was 89%. These results were achieved with moderate toxic effects (except for two deaths, one of which was due to a therapeutic misadventure) and suggest that the prospect for cure in children with ALL. may now approximate 80%, a degree of success that demands that consideration be given to reducing total therapy, at least for children with standard-risk disease. Further follow-up will determine whether these high event-free survival rates will stabilize and meet the criteria for cure.\r"

Noncompliance and overtreatment are among the causes of excessive health care expenses. An effective means of improving compliance and avoiding unwanted or fruitless treatment is improved physician-patient communication. Improved communication is also the most ethical means of avoiding these expenses. The educated participation of patients in treatment decisions and of the public in health policy formation is ethically and economically preferable to bureaucratic responses and user fees. The public must be made aware of the costs and limited benefits of medical treatments and of the effects of lifestyle on health. The medical encounter must become more supportive and educational. Medical school curricula must emphasize patient involvement, which must be reinforced to medical students and residents by staff physicians' genuine concern and effort. Quality assessments and assurance should include evaluation of communication, patient satisfaction, use of follow-up and duplication of services.\r"

  ".U": "90002664\r", 
  ".W": "A simple model was developed to project the potential effect of intravenous thrombolytic therapy on the caseloads of revascularization early after acute myocardial infarction. Published data were used to estimate the proportion of infarct patients eligible for thrombolytic treatment and their subsequent rates of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) within 2 weeks and up to 6 to 12 weeks after treatment. Toronto regional caseload data were obtained from registries and hospital discharge records. Our primary projections, based only on coronary angiography for evidence of spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia, suggest a 165% increase in the post-thrombolysis use of PTCA within 2 weeks of infarction and even greater increases 6 to 12 weeks after infarction. Adding in selective use of salvage PTCA for some patients with persisting pain despite thrombolysis increases the overall PTCA caseload within 2 weeks by 242%. Data on the current caseload of post-thrombolysis CABS are unavailable. However, our projected caseload for the 30% of infarct patients treated with thrombolytic drugs equals or exceeds the current number of CABS procedures performed on all infarct patients within a month of the event. All these projections are conservative, in that they consider neither procedures 3 to 12 months after infarction nor restenosis after PTCA. This analysis illustrates that current approaches to revascularization after thrombolytic therapy could have a substantial effect on PTCA and CABS caseloads. Further studies with improved caseload data are needed to validate these preliminary projections.\r"

The study population included seven communities in which five ethnic groups were represented: Inuit, Innu, mixed Inuit and European ancestry (\"settler\"), nonnative/nonsettler transient population (\"white\") and people of Innu-white or Innu-Inuit origin (\"mixed\"). Blood samples from 2156 people (62% of the area residents) were tested for antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV e antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBc IgM and antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs). The overall crude prevalence rate of HBV seromarkers was 14.7% and the HBsAg carrier rate at least 3.2%; the rates were highest for Inuit (26.4% and 6.9% respectively), followed by settler (10.0% and 1.9% respectively) and Innu (7.6% and 0.4% respectively); the white and mixed groups had the lowest overall rates (2.5% and 3.3% respectively). Although the overall prevalence rates were about the same for the two sexes, the HBsAg carrier rate was higher in males (male:female ratio 1.6:1.0). No HBV carriers were positive for HBeAg or anti-HBc IgM antibody. The rate of exposure to HBV was 4% for those below the age of 20 years and reached a peak for those aged 45 to 54 years (85% for Inuit, 40% for settlers and 37% for Innu). There was also a wide variation in the age-standardized prevalence rates (0% to 27.9%) among the ethnic groups in the seven communities surveyed.\r"

Ten patients undergoing elective surgery for primary colorectal cancer received intravenous HpD (2-5 mg/kg) either 3 or 72 hours preoperatively. Fluorescent photographs were taken of freshly resected specimens and analyzed using a computerized videodensitometric technique. This technique subtracted contaminating non-HpD fluorescence and facilitated estimation of HpD tissue levels. The HpD-specific fluorescence localized to tumors in all cases, and the mean HpD concentration was six-fold greater in malignant tissue than in surrounding normal mucosa (0.6 microgram/g versus 0.1 microgram/g, P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that HpD preferentially localizes to human colorectal cancer and this is relevant to the photodetection and phototherapy of colorectal neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Lorazepam, oxazepam, and methylprednisolone were compared for antiemetic efficacy in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. Three consecutive courses of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy were administered at equal doses so that each patient acted as his own control. Of 100 patients randomized, 85 received at least two of the three agents and were evaluable for analysis. Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with more than ten vomits compared to either oxazepam (P less than 0.05) or methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Lorazepam also significantly reduced the number of patients with the most severe degrees of vomiting compared to either oxazepam or methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.005). The duration of vomiting was reduced significantly after the first 48 hours postchemotherapy for those patients receiving lorazepam over those receiving methylprednisolone (P less than 0.05). Lorazepam significantly reduced the number of patients with severe nausea compared to both oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.05), but there were no significant differences in duration of nausea among the groups. The results of linear analogue self-assessment scores indicated a strong patient preference for lorazepam over both oxazepam and methylprednisolone. Drowsiness was significantly more common with both lorazepam and oxazepam compared to methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Patients who received lorazepam or oxazepam also experienced significantly more severe drowsiness than those patients receiving methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001). Lack of recall was significantly more common with lorazepam than with oxazepam and methylprednisolone (both P less than 0.001) and was more profound when lorazepam was compared with oxazepam (P less than 0.05) and with methylprednisolone (P less than 0.001). Methylprednisolone was administered with minimal side effects. The results of this randomized cross-over study indicate that, in the dosage/schedule used, lorazepam is a significantly superior premedicant than is either oxazepam or methylprednisolone in alleviating the distress of cytotoxic-induced emesis in patients receiving cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.\r"

Biopsies that produced three of these xenografts gave rise to parallel culture cell lines. Biopsy-derived and xenograft-derived cell lines from the same tumor behaved similarly in culture and exhibited similar markers when assessed immunohistochemically. Collagen substrate was beneficial in the primary culture of 50% of the specimens tested. Collagen was required for the successful propagation of two cell lines.\r"

Seventy-nine (95%) of the 83 patients had early disease that included 61 Stage I, 15 Stage IIA (pelvic or paraaortic lymph node involvement less than or equal to 5 cm), and 3 Stage IIB (pelvic or paraaortic lymph node involvement greater than 5 cm) patients. The 15-year actuarial survival for this group of Stage I and II patients was 95% (+/- 5%). Stage I patients were treated with a mean paraaortic/pelvic dose of 2924 cGy and only one patient developed recurrent disease. This recurrence was at the margin of the radiation field and probably represents a marginal miss. The Stage IIA patients were treated with slightly higher doses (mean, 3335 cGY) to the paraaortic/pelvic region and there were no recurrences. The three Stage IIB patients received tumor doses of 3245 cGy, 4090 cGy, and 4500 cGy, respectively, and there were no recurrences. Low dose prophylactic mediastinal and supraclavicular irradiation (mean, 2320 cGy) was used in 17 (94%) of the 18 Stage II patients and there were no mediastinal or supraclavicular recurrences. Four patients presented with advanced disease (one Stage III, three Stage IV) and the only disease-free survivor was treated with cisplatinum-based combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Three patients developed minor complications from the radiation therapy: one patient had persistent scrotal and leg edema and two patients treated with prophylactic mediastinal irradiation had chronic low leukocyte counts. Two of the 79 Stage I and II patients developed a second malignancy: one had bronchogenic carcinoma at the margin of a mediastinal field, and one had diffuse histiocytic lymphoma both in and out of the radiation therapy fields. The 15-year actuarial probability of developing a second malignancy was 3.3%. Radiation therapy after operation is a successful treatment option for most patients with Stage I and II seminoma.\r"

Median performance status (World Health Organization) was 0, ranging from 0 to 2. One complete response and one partial response was observed. All patients experienced flu-like symptoms attributed to alpha-IFN. Leukopenia was observed in 12 patients and a planned dose escalation of VBL was undertaken for the patients only. It is concluded that combined alpha-IFN and VBL is only marginally effective in patients with advanced malignant melanoma who have had prior chemotherapy.\r"

Two cases had an early intrathymic immunophenotype (CD4-negative, CD8-negative, CD1-negative), seven cases had an intermediate intrathymic immunophenotype (CD1-positive, CD4-positive, CD8-positive), and two cases had a late intrathymic immunophenotype (CD1-positive, CD8-positive, CD4-negative); one case expressed T-cell and B-cell markers. The peripheral T-cell lymphomas were morphologically subclassified according to the updated Kiel classification. T-cell lymphomas of low-grade malignancy--chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, T-zone lymphoma, and pleomorphic small cell lymphoma--in general had a complete immunophenotype matching the immunophenotypes of normal peripheral T-cells. In addition these cases were CD38-positive and HLA class II-positive. The T-cell lymphomas of high-grade intermediate and large cell, immunoblastic and large cell anaplastic lymphoma--were characterized by loss of T-cell markers.

LAK cells were produced by culturing all PBL in rIL-2 (500 U/ml) for 4 days. In 4-hour chromium release assays, LAK cells showed greater cytotoxicity than ASL against natural killer (NK)-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cell lines; by 18 hours, the effectiveness of ASL equaled that of LAK cells. By electron microscopic study, PBL, LAK cells, and ASL showed differences. The helper/inducer to suppressor/cytotoxic ratio (T4+/T8+) of PBL, LAK cells, and ASL was 1.1:1, 1.0:1, and 0.4:1, respectively. ASL, when compared with PBL or LAK cells, have a significantly higher percentage of MO1+/DR+ and T8+/9.3+ subpopulations. ASL and LAK cells, used for the therapy of gliomas, are distinct.\r"

There was no correlation between the positivity of CEA immunocytochemistry for any of the four antibodies and histologic grade, lymph node stage, locoregional recurrence, disease-free interval (DFI), or patient survival. This large study with a long follow-up period for patients has shown that CEA and CEA/NCA immunocytochemistry have no relation to prognosis in breast cancer. An extensive review of the literature that confirms these findings should end the controversy over the place of CEA and CEA/NCA immunocytochemistry in breast cancer.\r"

It was found that 83% (25/30) of the patients with psoriasis and 80% (12/15) of the patients with eczema had SCC levels in excess of the cut-off value of 2.5 ng/ml. In psoriasis the serum SCC level correlated positively with the body surface area affected by the disease (r = 0.64). Seven patients with miscellaneous skin disorders, all with an inflammatory component, showed high serum SCC levels as well. Thus the existence of an inflammatory skin disease or a hyperkeratotic skin disease with an inflammatory component interferes with the usefulness of the SCC antigen as a tumor marker in SCC of the uterine cervix.\r"

The mean nuclear DNA content (MNDC) of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas was significantly larger than that of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas both in Stages I + II and III + IV (P less than 0.001, each), and the MNDC of Stages III + IV was significantly larger than that of I + II in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (P less than 0.01). There was a tendency for histogram Patterns III and IV, in which more aneuploid cells were present than in I and II, to be more common and for the incidence of the aneuploid stem cell line to be higher in less differentiated and more advanced adenocarcinomas, although the differences were not significant statistically. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between MNDC and MNA (P less than 0.01) and between MNDC and SDNA (P less than 0.05). The averages of the MNA according to the histogram pattern increased significantly in the increasing order of Patterns I to IV. These results indicate that the nuclear DNA content increases in less differentiated and more advanced adenocarcinomas, and that the nuclear atypia is reflected in abnormal nuclear DNA content (DNA aneuploidy).\r"

  ".W": "Forty seven patients with early gastric cancer received a 30-minute intravenous injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), 1000 mg each 1 hour before laparotomy, to label tumor cells in the S phase. In 13 of 47 patients, specimens obtained by endoscopic biopsy were cultured in vitro at 37 degrees C for 1 hour under three times the atmospheric pressure in a vial with 400 microM BrdU. Labeled cells were detected in the resected specimen and the cultured specimen by immunohistochemical staining procedure. The BrdU labeling index (LI, defined as the percentage of labeled cells in relation to the 1000 tumor cells) was calculated for each specimen. All patients without lymph node metastasis had an in vivo BrdU LI of less than 12%. In contrast, 31% of patients with early gastric cancer with an in vivo BrdU LI greater than 12% had lymph node metastasis. There was a correlation between the in vivo and the in vitro LI. Therefore, the in vitro BrdU LI of specimens obtained by endoscopic biopsy may be a useful indicator of lymph node status in patients with individual early gastric cancers before operations. If the in vitro BrdU LI is less than 12% lymph node dissection may not be necessary.\r"

A comparison of ploidy with staging and standard histologic variables was performed. None of the patients who presented without metastases died of disease during the follow-up period. Eleven of 13 patients of this group had a diploid/near diploid pattern, and metastases developed in only one patient. Patients with metastatic disease and a diploid/near diploid DNA content had a significantly better survival rate than those with aneuploid primary tumors. Statistical analysis showed that grade and ploidy contributed significant but independent prognostic information. We concluded that DNA content is a useful prognostic factor in renal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of the extent of metastatic disease in the circulating levels of CA 15-3 and carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) was studied in 173 patients with advanced breast carcinoma. Estimates of the extent of metastatic disease were obtained by an objective arbitrary scale. Patients were observed clinically after serum samples were obtained, and survival was recorded. Elevated values of CA 15-3 (greater than 40 U/ml) were seen in 130 patients and CEA values (greater than 5 ng/ml) in 97 cases (75% versus 56%, P less than .0001). Elevated CA 15-3 values correlated with the estimated extent of metastatic disease (P less than .0001), number of metastases (P = .0006), and survival from study entry (P = .01). Elevated CEA values correlated with extent of disease (P less than .0001), but not with the number of metastases or with survival. No correlation was found between the elevated values of CA 15-3 or CEA and age, menopausal status, and initial tumor size or nodal status. The combination of the elevated values of CA 15-3 and CEA was more sensitive than CA 15-3 alone (P = .04), but there were no significant improvements when subgroups were considered. Significant differences, that depended on which specific organ was affected dominantly by metastases, were seen in the mean levels of CA 15-3 antigen. Similarly, patients with liver involvement had higher mean levels of CA 15-3 than those without hepatic metastases. A stepwise regression analysis of the dominant site of metastases, liver involvement, and estimated extent of disease showed that only the latter parameter retained a significant correlation with CA 15-3 antigen levels (P less than .0001). Median survival of patients who showed abnormal CA 15-3 levels was significantly shorter than that of patients with nonelevated CA 15-3 (10.1 versus 18.0 months, P = .04). This difference was not appreciated with CEA levels (10.2 versus 12.2 months, P = .4). We conclude that tumor marker levels in patients with advanced breast carcinoma correlate with the extent of metastatic disease. In addition, the CA 15-3 assay is more sensitive and correlates more accurately with the extent of disease than CEA. Finally, the observed CA 15-3 differences by organ involvement are related to the extent of disease variations. The objective evaluation of the extent of metastatic disease provides a new approach in the study and comparison of breast cancer-associated tumor markers.\r"

Follow-up indicates that this group represents 70% of all patients with recurrent disease. Because patients with less than 20% nodal involvement were found to have a statistically significant better progression-free-survival (PFS) than those with greater than 20% nodal involvement, we examined the exact anatomic sites of nodal metastases. The status of obturator, external iliac, internal iliac, and common iliac nodes was compared to PFS and overall survival in 198 patients with D-1 disease in both protocols. Results demonstrate no significant difference in either PFS or overall survival relative to anatomic sites of positive nodes. These data suggest that although minimal pelvic nodal metastasis is consistent with improved PFS, there is no predictable anatomic distribution of disease consonant with that better prognosis.\r"

Patients underwent percutaneous transbrachial artery catheterization of the hepatic artery followed by 21-day continuous 5-FU infusion (CT). Hepatic irradiation of 25.5 Gy was delivered to 19 patients 14 days after completion of infusion (CT + RT). All patients received subsequent weekly maintenance 5-FU. A 37% (seven of 19) response rate was observed in CT + RT, and a 50% response rate (nine of 18) in CT: median survival was 6 months for CT + RT, and 8 months for CT, (P = 0.106). Improved survival was observed in two subsets of patients. Tumor vascularity was graded angiographically from 0 to 4+; those patients with highest vascularity (4+) had a 20-month median survival (P = 0.0009). Patients with Grade 1, well-differentiated, histologic type had a median survival of 20 months (P = 0.0001). Four patients with both 4+ vascularity and Grade 1 histologic type had 27.5 months' median survival (P = 0.0019). Age, performance status, elevated liver function tests, previous systemic therapy, and time interval between diagnosis and entry on this study did not impact on survival (P greater than 0.05), nor did these variables eliminate the significance of vascularity and grade (P less than 0.05). Survival after intraarterial 5-FU infusion was not improved by this regimen of sequential external irradiation. Regional therapy may benefit those patients with 4+ vascular tumors and/or well-differentiated tumor grade. Future trials are needed to explore the interaction of halogenated pyrimidines with irradiation and determine whether these prognostic factors can aid in patient selection for regional therapy of hepatic metastases.\r"

VCR concentrations were determined by a sensitive radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed by a nonlinear weighted least-square regression program (SAS-NLIN). A tri-exponential model fitted the raw data better than a bi-exponential model in five of 14 (35%) patients treated with VCR alone and in seven of 12 (58%) patients treated with VCR plus NIF (P = NS). The T1/2 alpha was shorter in NIF-treated patients, whereas the T1/2 gamma was longer in the NIF-treated group. The NIF-treated group showed an increase in the AUC O-infinity and AUC 1 to 96 hours, and a decrease in the AUC 0 to 1 hour. Total plasma clearance of VCR and 7-day urinary excretion of VCR was reduced in the NIF-treated patients. These data suggest that, when VCR is administered to NIF-treated patients with cancer, there is a decrease in VCR clearance from the body. Theoretically, a greater cytotoxicity may be anticipated.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and aggressive chemotherapy was assessed in 67 patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In most cases, treatment was started because of worsening peripheral cytopenia, increase in bone marrow blasts, or transition of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Of 51 patients (age range, 18-82 years) receiving low-dose Ara-C by subcutaneous bolus injection (10 mg/m2 every 12 hours) or continuous intravenous infusion (20 mg/m2/day), nine (18%) entered complete remission (CR) and four (8%) had a partial response (PR). Duration of CR varied from 4 to 25+ months. Overall survival of patients treated with Ara-C was not superior to that of a historical control receiving supportive care only. Hematologic toxicity of low-dose Ara-C was considerable, with 12 patients (24%) dying of hemorrhage or infection during the initial treatment course. Sixteen patients (age range, 17-65 years) who presented with a Karnofsky score of more than 80% were chosen for aggressive chemotherapy using standard AML protocols. In this group, nine CR and two PR were obtained. Early death from pneumonia occurred in two patients, and three patients had refractory disease. The factors most strongly associated with successful remission induction were (1) presence of Auer rods in granulocyte precursors, and (2) a comparatively low medullary blast count (less than 30%) at the start of treatment. Median duration of bone marrow aplasia for patients entering CR was 21 days (range, 6-51). Prolonged remissions (22+, 27+, and 29 months, respectively) could be achieved in three of four patients receiving consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy after induction of CR. From these data we conclude that aggressive chemotherapy should not generally be considered contraindicated in advanced MDS. In patients with a good Karnofsky score, this form of treatment may be more advantageous than the currently favored low-dose Ara-C, which is also myelotoxic, but induces remissions in only a minority of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Postmenopausal women who underwent modified radical mastectomy for Stage II, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive endocrine treatment (tamoxifen [T], 40 mg daily for 3 years) alone versus endocrine treatment plus five-drug chemotherapy (Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide, C], methotrexate [M], 5-fluorouracil [F], vincristine [V], and prednisone [P], CMFVP, for 1 year). Chemotherapy consisted of oral P (1 month), oral C (12 months), and intravenous MFV weekly for the first 3 months, biweekly for 3 months, and triweekly for 6 months. Patients were entered into the study from October 1979, to October 1985, and the median follow-up is 55 months. Results show that with 94 postmenopausal women, disease-free survival (DFS) is significantly greater (P = 0.04, log-rank test; P = 0.03, multivariate analysis) in patients receiving CMFVPT as compared to those receiving T alone. These results suggest that intensive chemotherapy combined with T is more effective in delaying recurrence than T alone in postmenopausal patients.\r"

Eleven patients received 1500 cGY ICR and 4000 cGy EBR (Group 1) and ten patients received 1500 cGy plus 2000 to 3000 cGy EBR (Group 2). Effectiveness of radiotherapy was expressed as the ratio between depth of radiation effect and depth of tumor invasion. Depth was expressed as one of four levels: Level I, not deeper than the muscularis mucosa; Level 2, involving but not deeper than submucosa; Level 3, involving but not deeper than muscularis propria; and Level 4, involving periesophageal soft tissue. The depth of radiation damage to tumor cells was comparable between the two groups. However, residual tumor was present in the periesophageal tissue in only one of 11 patients after high-dose EBR compared to of ten patients with lower dose EBR (P less than 0.01, chi-square test). A ratio of one between radiation effect and depth of tumor invasion was present in six patients receiving high-dose EBR and one patient receiving lower dose EBR (P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that ICR combined with EBR affords good local tumor control in the majority of patients. Higher doses of EBR give a better radiation effect in deeper layers of the esophageal wall. The ratio between depth of radiation effect and tumor invasion provides a simple and objective approach to the pathologic analysis of esophagectomy specimens.\r"

It has also been shown that multiple biopsy is superior to clinical examination in evaluating the extent of disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Multiple biopsies are suggested for the early detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in high-risk cases. Although the better-defined tumor extent do not currently influence the treatment policy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and it is too early to assess its prognostic significance, it betters our understanding of the behavior of this tumor. Future analysis in correlation with long-term follow-up data may help to improve the stage classification systems and treatment strategy.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (LCL), bone marrow involvement at the time of diagnosis is a poor prognostic sign. Since 1980, the authors have encountered 13 patients LCL who had simultaneous bone marrow involvement by small cleaved cell lymphoma (11 cases) or mixed small and LCL (two cases), a phenomenon known as \"discordant\" or \"divergent\" bone marrow histology. The patients ranged in age from 33 to 85 years (median, 61 years) and presented most commonly with Stage III or IV disease, independent of bone marrow involvement. Seventy-seven percent achieved complete remission (CR) with combination chemotherapy; 50% of these eventually relapsed and died of their disease. One patient died of unrelated causes. No recurrences of low-grade lymphoma were observed, as judged either by clinical behavior or rebiopsy. The survival of the patients with discordant bone marrow histology was compared with that of patients with LCL with or without bone marrow involvement by LCL. Of the 11 patients with discordant marrow histology followed for a minimum of 2 years, four (36%) are long-term survivors; this is comparable to the 2-year survival of patients with LCL without bone marrow involvement (45%). In contrast, 89% of patients with bone marrow biopsy specimens positive for LCL died within 18 months from the time of diagnosis (mean survival, 5.7 months). All diffuse LCL tested were of B-lineage. The authors attempted to determine whether the presence of discordant bone marrow histologic types indicated an underlying low-grade B-cell lymphoma in these patients by evaluating the peripheral blood of the long-term survivors for the presence of clonal excess. Of the three surviving evaluable patients tested, one had evidence of clonal excess in the peripheral blood. For patients with LCL who have a simultaneous bone marrow biopsy positive for low-grade lymphoma (discordant marrow histology), survival is no different from that of patients with negative marrows, and markedly better than that for patients with marrows positive for diffuse LCL. The biological significance of discordant bone marrow histology is not clear at this time.\r"

Currently, 19% (19/101) of the patients have recurred. No significant relations have been found between recurrence or survival and age, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, tumor size, and tumor type. The DNA index (ploidy) was not related to any clinical variable, time to recurrence, or survival. Aneuploid tumors did, however, have significantly higher %S phase activity. Patients with %S activity less than or equal to the median value were significantly different from those patients with %S above the median. They were older and had a higher frequency of ER/PR positive and well- or moderately differentiated tumors. Patients with %S + G2/M greater than the median value showed shorter time to recurrence (P = .055) and shorter survival (P = .006), whereas %S alone was significantly associated only with survival. Multivariate analysis showed that neither DNA index nor cell kinetics was significantly associated with time to relapse. DNA index was not significantly associated with survival; %S was of borderline significance whereas %S + %G2/M was a significant independent predictor of survival. Although FC data may provide independent information related to survival in N-women, additional research in a larger number of patients is needed to define its precise role in patient management.\r"

Suitable histologic material was accessible in 137 of these patients, of whom 70% had ER-positive tumors. The ER-positive patients had a significantly longer median overall survival than ER-negative patients (67 versus 32 months, P much less than 0.001) and this was an effect of both a prolonged disease-free interval (27 versus 17 months, P less than 0.05) and a prolonged survival after recurrence (41 versus 15 months, P much less than 0.001). Response to endocrine therapy was obtained in 49% of the patients with ER-positive tumors and in 7% with ER-negative tumors (P much less than 0.001). Relationship between response and semiquantified individual staining features could not be established. It is concluded that ER analysis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue offers clinically useful information for allocation of patients to endocrine therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We did a multivariate analysis of 1262 patients with operable, invasive ductal breast carcinoma to assess the prognostic value of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) histologic grading system. Nodal metastasis and SBR were the two most important factors for metastasis-free survival (MFS), P = 10-9 and P = 10-5, respectively, for total study time. In patients who were node negative, the SBR and International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stages were the most important for MFS (P = 4 X 10-4 and P = 0.03). In order to try to improve the SBR prognostic value, we first studied the three components of the SBR separately: ductoglandular differentiation proved the least predictive and nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index the most predictive. A rearrangement of the two nuclear scores alone produced higher risk values and better risk separation of patient subpopulations than SBR, and eliminated the SBR from the multivariate model. This rearrangement, modified SBR (MSBR), defined five new risk subgroups with statistically different risk ratios for MFS (P = 3 X 10-8). SBR grade II (55% of patients) was separated into three MSBR groups significantly different according to MFS (P = 0.008). In the patients who were node negative, MSBR replaced the SBR and was the most important factor for prediction of relapse of MFS (P less than 0.00001). The MSBR is more accurate and predictive than the standard SBR grade and is particularly useful when the nodal status of the patient is negative or unknown.\r"

Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) were measured by dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) method whereas proliferative activity was measured by 3H-thymidine autoradiographic labeling index (LI). The percentages of ER+ and PgR+ cases resulted lower in IBC than in LABC (ER+, 44% versus 64%; PgR+, 30% versus 51%, respectively), pertaining to both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Inflammatory breast carcinoma showed a higher median LI value than LABC (3.5% versus 1.6%; P = 0.006). Regarding clinical aspects, time to progression (TTP) in IBC patients was not affected by hormone receptor status (19 evaluable patients) or by LI (17 evaluable patients); PgR+ status and low LI resulted important for individualizing women with a longer median overall survival (OS). Inflammatory breast carcinoma has been verified to be a heterogeneous biological entity for which hormone receptors and cell kinetics could be useful in identifying patients with different prognoses and therefore candidates for a personalized therapy.\r"

  ".W": "All patients diagnosed with primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma in one institution between 1962 and 1987 were reviewed. Of the 26 cases studied, 16 had been diagnosed originally as PNETs, seven tumors were rediagnosed as PNET or EOE by histologic review, and three tumors had an original diagnosis of extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma. To determine whether these diagnoses determine a group of tumors with unique biologic behavior and identifiable pathologic characteristics, clinical and treatment response data were compiled, and electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies were done for those patients with adequate samples. With combined modality therapy, this group achieved a substantially shorter disease control interval than patients with disseminated osseous Ewing's sarcoma or disseminated neuroblastoma--10.8 months versus 17 months and 16 months, respectively. The pattern of relapse and distant spread also differed among these tumor types. Immunohistochemical studies (for example, neuron-specific enolase and beta 2 microglobulin) were helpful in confirming the diagnosis but were not definitive in themselves. Tentative diagnostic criteria are proposed for use in studies designed to provide further information on the nature and treatment of PNET. Some of the controversies regarding diagnosis are discussed. The authors propose a uniform approach to treatment of extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma and PNET in order to try to clarify their relation.\r"

This practice derives from the observation that these characteristics are typical of the rare, nonpolyposis inherited colorectal cancer syndromes. This study examines these two characteristics in cases of common colon cancer to determine whether they actually distinguish individuals at increased risk for familial colorectal cancer. Familial clusters of colon cancer in the Utah Population Data Base were examined. Common colon cancers were found to cluster excessively in families; however, the measure of familial clustering for distal colonic cases was increased to the same degree as proximal colonic cases. Early age onset was likewise not a distinguishing factor of familial cases. These results suggest that factors other than those that predispose to the rare syndromes are important in determining familial risk for common colon cancers, and that the absence of these two clinical features should not suggest the absence of familial risk of colorectal cancer.\r"

It is less time consuming, permits the use of a variety of standard preformed guiding catheters, is associated with less patient discomfort, and the sheaths may be left in place for many hours if the angioplasty is complicated and/or long-term anticoagulation is desirable. Complications were limited to the female patients in this series. This technique is most suited to those operators who employ the brachial approach infrequently and only out of necessity in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease.\r"

Ejection times, stroke volumes (thermodilution), ejection rates, and pressure gradients were measured. For each parameter, ejection was then divided into two components: accelerative (onset systole to peak gradient) and decelerative (peak gradient to end systole). After valvuloplasty, there was 1) a decrease in overall ejection time and in mean and peak pressure gradients; 2) an increase in overall ejection rate; 3) no change in stroke volume or heart rate; 4) an increase in both accelerative and decelerative ejection rates and a decrease in the decelerative ejection time (expressed as a percentage of the R-R interval); and 5) a decrease in the time for the ejection of the final 25% of stroke volume (P less than 0.01) and time occupied by the final 25% of the gradient. Immediately following balloon aortic valvuloplasty, there is a decrease in ejection time and in increase in ejection rate. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty has a significant effect on the dynamics of left ventricle ejection, with changes primarily expressed in late systole. By improving the mobility of calcified leaflets, balloon aortic valvuloplasty may reduce the forces opposing forward blood movement during the decelerative phase of ejection.\r"

  ".U": "90003214\r", 
  ".W": "Global ventricular function parameters such as the ejection fraction and the sum of wall motion scores for segments of the left ventricle are excellent predictors of long-term survival in patients with coronary heart disease. These are usually determined from a monoplane right anterior oblique view. It was hypothesized that a biplane weighted wall motion score that included the left anterior oblique projection might better predict survival. A new score (BISCORE) was derived for 1,433 Mayo Clinic ventriculograms coded by the methods of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS). Weighting coefficients for each left ventricular segment were derived by the proportional hazards technique, and this resulted in the equation BISCORE = 120 - (8.6 x anterobasal + 3.4 x basal septum + 2.9 x apical + 2.7 x posterolateral + 2.4 diaphragmatic), which yielded a score from 0 (all segments aneurysmal) to 100 (all segments normal). This score stratified the original 1,433 patients into distinct groups by survival. As a single variable it was better than previous wall motion scores and ejection fraction at predicting survival. When prospectively applied to 5,172 Coronary Artery Surgery Study patients, this new score again proved to be a better predictor of survival than previous unweighted scores. Since the new score contains terms from the left anterior oblique ventriculographic projection, it is concluded that this projection adds information to that of the right anterior oblique projection regarding survival. Furthermore, this weighted score appears more highly associated with survival than unweighted scores.\r"

Sixteen adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to receive as premedication 15 micrograms sufentanil either intravenously or intranasally. Before administration and at fixed time intervals thereafter, the degree of sedation was assessed, vital signs were recorded and venous blood samples were taken for the determination of sufentanil plasma concentrations. Peroperative sedation of rapid onset and limited duration was seen in both groups. However, the onset of sedation was more rapid after intravenous injection. At 10 min, all patients in the IV group were sedated versus only two in the intranasal group (P less than 0.01). No significant intergroup differences in sedation were seen at 20 to 60 min. This clinical effect is in agreement with the measured plasma levels, which were significantly lower after intranasal application at 5 and 10 min, being 36 and 56 per cent of those after IV dosing, respectively. From 30 min, plasma concentrations were virtually identical for the two routes of administration. The AUC0-120 min after intranasal dosing was 78 per cent of that after intravenous injection. Intranasal dosing induced no clinically significant changes in vital signs, whereas after IV sufentanil, a clinically significant decrease in PaO2 was seen at 5 min. The results of this study show that sufentanil, when administered intranasally, is rapidly and effectively absorbed from the human nasal mucosa, so that this route may be an attractive alternative for a premedicant, avoiding the discomfort of an intravenous or intramuscular injection.\r"

We performed IVRA with three solutions of lidocaine (0.25, 0.375, 0.5 per cent) administered in a volume equal to the forearm venous system. Angiographic results indicate that: a forearm tourniquet provides adequate vascular isolation; the volume of the forearm venous system can be correlated with body weight; the progression of the fluid in the venous system follows a pattern that is similar for all patients with the small veins of the distal forearm and proximal hand being filled last. With this technique, lidocaine 0.5 per cent resulted in a dose of 1.5 mg.kg-1 and provided excellent analgesia. Lower concentrations were unsatisfactory. We conclude that the use of a forearm tourniquet allows reduction of the local anaesthetic dose to a non-toxic level and thus increases the safety of IVRA.\r"

Forty ASA physical status I and II patients were randomized to two groups. In a double-blinded fashion, patients in both groups received an epidural injection of 15 ml of local anaesthetic (LA) solution via a Tuohy needle at the L3-4 interspace. Local anaesthesia for Group I was prepared by adding 3 mEq NaHCO3 to 27 ml three per cent 2-CP and for Group II was prepared by adding 3 ml 0.9 per cent NaCl to 27 ml three per cent 2-CP. Both solutions contained epinephrine (1:200,000). The pH of commercially prepared Nesacaine MPF was 3.19 +/- 0.02. The pH of the solutions used for Group I and Group II patients were 7.32 +/- 0.01 and 3.27 +/- 0.02, respectively. Times to analgesia and anaesthesia at the L2 dermatome were significantly decreased in Group I patients by 2.5 and 6.6 minutes, respectively. Likewise, pH-adjustment accelerated the attainment of maximum level of block by 2.8 min. No statistical differences were found between groups in the maximum level of epidural block, or in time to 2-segment regression. No precipitation of LA was observed in pH-adjusted solutions of 2-CP after 24 hours. We recommend the use of pH-adjusted three per cent 2-CP (Nesacaine MPF) to accelerate the onset of epidural block.\r"

Nitrogen concentration was monitored continuously while the women breathed 100 per cent O2 for three minutes and took four deep breaths of 100 per cent O2 using a circle anaesthesia system and 8 L.min-1 fresh gas flow. Parturients achieved 95 per cent denitrogenation significantly (P less than 0.0005) faster than non-pregnant women (54.5 +/- 17.8 vs 110.8 +/- 35.7 sec). In parturients, denitrogenation for three minutes lowered expired N2 concentration to 1.0 +/- 0.2 per cent while four deep breaths lowered it to 5.1 +/- 1.7 per cent (P less than 0.0001). This difference, while statistically significant, is predicted to supply only 10-15 sec of extra protection against hypoxaemia, and thus is probably not clinically significant. The authors conclude that either two minutes of tidal breathing or four deep breaths of 100 per cent O2 provide adequate denitrogenation and similar protection against apnoeic hypoxaemia in normal parturients.\r"

Heart rate, blood pressure and echocardiographic measurements of cardiac output, stroke volume and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were obtained prior to the induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with 25 mg.kg-1 two per cent rectal methohexitone. Immediately following the onset of sleep all cardiovascular measurements were repeated. Following the induction of anaesthesia with rectal methohexitone there was a significant increase in heart rate. Blood pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume and ejection fraction were unchanged. It is concluded that rectal administration of two per cent methohexitone for the induction of anaesthesia in healthy paediatric patients has minimal haemodynamic effect.\r"

Thirty-eight patients undergoing coronary artery surgery who had normal electrocardiograms before induction of anaesthesia were included. Leads II and CS5 were recorded on a Holter monitor and radial arterial and pulmonary artery catheters were used to measure haemodynamic variables. Eight patients developed ST-segment changes greater than or equal to 0.1 mV before sternotomy. Preoperative factors could not be used to predict which patients would develop ST-segment changes. In all 38 patients haemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and demand remained within an optimal range despite evidence of ischaemia in eight. This syndrome of ECG changes in the absence of tachycardia and hypertension resembles the syndrome of silent ischaemia documented in awake patients. Our findings suggest that myocardial ischaemia may be caused by decreases in coronary blood flow not associated with changes in haemodynamic variables.\r"

  ".W": "Seven Yorkshire swine, ages 7-11 days and weighing 1.4-2.8 kg were studied to determine the effects of temperature and volume of injectate, depth of anaesthesia, position of the central venous catheter tip and vagotomy on the R-R interval after central venous injection of saline. The swine were anaesthetized with halothane in 100 per cent oxygen and their lungs ventilated to normocapnia. The length of the R-R varied inversely with the temperature of the injectate between 0 and 20 degrees C reaching a maximum prolongation of 152 per cent above control values with 0 degrees C saline. Injecting saline at 37 degrees C did not affect the R-R interval. The length of the R-R interval varied directly with the volume of injectate between 1.5 and 4.5 ml.kg-1 (P less than 0.05). The R-R interval response also varied directly with the depth of anaesthesia: the post-injection R-R interval increased from 185 per cent to 341 per cent as the end-tidal halothane concentration increased from 0.45 to 1.20 per cent. The position of the tip of the central venous catheter that produced the maximum increase in the R-R interval, as determined radiographically, was at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. Neither bilateral vagotomy nor atropine (50 micrograms.kg-1) affected the R-R interval after injecting 3 ml.kg-1 saline 0 degrees C. We conclude that the increases in R-R interval after injection of fluid into the right atrium are due to direct effects on the nerve conduction system of the heart, possibly on the sino-atrial node.\r"

  ".W": "General anesthetics, typically octanol, were found to inhibit the influx of calcium in isolated sodium-loaded adult rat heart cells, using 45Ca, quin 2, or indo 1. Inhibition by octanol, like inhibition by sodium, was competitive with calcium. Octanol and sodium together inhibited calcium influx synergistically. At physiological levels of extracellular calcium and sodium, the EC50 was 177 +/- 37 microM for octanol and 48 +/- 5 microM for decanol. These values are threefold to fourfold larger than those reported to cause 50% loss of righting reflex in tadpoles, a measure of their anesthetic effectiveness. We conclude that general anesthetics inhibit Na-Ca exchange at the sarcolemma. We suggest that octanol inhibits like sodium, and the synergism stems from the cooperativity of sodium inhibition at the binding and regulatory sites of the exchanger. Insofar as Na-Ca exchange may regulate inotropy, the inhibition of Na-Ca exchange by general anesthetics could contribute to their negative inotropic effect.\r"

  ".W": "In studies of ischemia and reperfusion, a major experimental problem has been the inability to measure intracellular ionized calcium ([Ca2+]i) in the intact heart. We have developed a new approach in which the bioluminescent calcium indicator aequorin is used to measure [Ca2+]i in the isolated, coronary-perfused ferret heart. Aequorin is loaded into subepicardial myocytes of the left ventricle, and the signals are recorded simultaneously along with isovolumic left ventricular (LV) pressure at a constant pacing rate. This system shows 1) no attenuation or change of time course of LV pressure development or coronary perfusion pressure after aequorin loading; 2) consistent responses to physiological interventions and drugs; 3) individual aequorin and pressure signals that do not require signal averaging for analysis; and 4) [Ca2+]i levels comparable with those reported in tissue or isolated myocyte cell preparations. During 5 minutes of hypoxia, diastolic [Ca2+]i and LV diastolic pressure increased while the systolic values of both [Ca2+]i and pressure decreased. The peak-to-peak systolic [Ca2+]i versus LV isovolumic pressure relation remained close to the control curve. In contrast, during 3 minutes of global ischemia, LV systolic and diastolic pressures fell rapidly, while [Ca2+]i increased substantially. The [Ca2+]i versus pressure relations for both systole and diastole shifted to the right, indicating desensitization of the contractile apparatus to [Ca2+]i. These results provide evidence that different primary mechanisms determine the systolic and diastolic responses to acute hypoxia versus ischemia. During hypoxia, changes in [Ca2+]i handling probably play a major role, while during ischemia, changes in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments appear to be of primary importance in the modulation of contractile dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "90003643\r", 
  ".W": "The roles of H+-Na+ and Na+-Ca2+ exchange in the depression of ventricular function were studied in the reperfused isolated ischemic rat heart. Zero-flow global ischemia was induced for either 15 or 30 minutes and was followed by 30 minutes of aerobic reperfusion. Intracellular Na+ (Na+i) and 45Ca2+ uptake were measured during ischemia and reperfusion. Accumulation of Na+i was modified by prior glycogen depletion and by treatment with amiloride, a H+-Na+ exchange inhibitor, or monensin, a Na+ ionophore. Na+i rose continuously during ischemia and rapidly during the first two minutes of reperfusion. The larger inhibitory effect of amiloride and preischemic glycogen depletion was on Na+i accumulation during reperfusion; this finding suggests that the uptake occurs by H+-Na+ exchange. Reduction of Na+i accumulation by glycogen depletion was associated with less lactate and, presumably, H+ production and accumulation during ischemia. The rapid increase in Na+i during early reperfusion may reflect the readjustment of the low intracellular pH resulting from ischemia. The level of Na+i at the end of ischemia and especially after two minutes of reperfusion were linearly correlated with 45Ca2+ uptake and depression of ventricular function during subsequent reperfusion. This highly significant correlation between Na+i and 45Ca2+ uptake when Na+i was varied by several independent procedures, including monensin, strongly suggests that reperfusion 45Ca2+ uptake occurs at least in part by Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The rate of 45Ca2+ uptake during reperfusion was linearly and highly significantly correlated with elevation of diastolic pressure, reduced developed pressure, and decreased recovery of ventricular function. The data strongly support a mechanism of ischemic cell damage that involves excessive production and accumulation of H+ during ischemia that exchanges for extracellular Na+ during ischemia and rapidly during the first few minutes of reperfusion. Increased Na+i then causes excessive 45Ca2+ uptake and depressed recovery of cellular functions with continued reperfusion. Increased levels of Na+i may be a major event that couples a decreased intracellular pH during ischemia to excessive 45Ca2+ uptake and depressed recovery of cellular function with reperfusion.\r"

The A1 adenosine receptor radioligand [125I]aminobenzyladenosine bound to a single affinity class of receptors in heart cell membranes from control animals with Bmax and KD of 18.3 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg protein and 3.7 +/- 0.6 nM, respectively (n = 8). Heart cell membranes from animals fed theophylline for 2, 7, and 14 days bound the radioligand with about the same affinity, but the number of binding sites was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) to 30.6 +/- 1.7 (n = 3), 30.0 +/- 0.8 (n = 3), and 27.3 +/- 2.9 (n = 4), respectively. Nearly identical results were obtained with membranes prepared from enzymatically dispersed ventricular myocytes. Fourteen days of theophylline treatment also produced a small increase (12%, p less than 0.01) in the number of binding sites in membranes derived from cerebral cortexes. Isolated ventricular myocytes prepared from animals fed no drug or theophylline for 7 days were used to determine the effect of adenosine on 20 nM isoproterenol-stimulated calcium current (ICa) measured by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Adenosine reduced isoproterenol-stimulated ICa without affecting the activation or inactivation kinetics of the current; ICa density was reduced less by 5 microM adenosine in cells from control (25 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 3 microA/microF) than in cells from theophylline-fed animals (26 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 2 microA/microF). Although a high concentration (0.5 mM) of adenosine abolished isoproterenol-stimulated ICa in cells from control or theophylline-fed animals, the IC50 for adenosine was sixfold less in cells derived from theophylline-fed animals than in cells from control animals (4.6 +/- 0.6 microM and 28.3 +/- 1.4 microM, respectively, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the increase in ICa in response to isoproterenol alone and the potency of acetylcholine to antagonize this effect of isoproterenol were the same in both groups of cells. A maximally effective concentration of R-phenylisopropyladenosine (0.1 mM) inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation less in cardiomyocytes from control than from theophylline-fed animals (28.7 +/- 1.8% vs. 42.0 +/- 4.2%, p less than 0.05). In summary, exposure of the myocardium to theophylline increases the number of adenosine receptors and the effects of receptor occupancy by agonists. These findings imply that the endogenous concentration of adenosine is high enough in the normoxic guinea pig heart to chronically maintain adenosine receptors in a partially down-regulated state.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously studied the relation between long-chain fatty acid and pyruvate metabolism in reperfused myocardium and noted a rapid return of fatty acid oxidation to at least preischemic values accompanied by a marked decrease in pyruvate oxidation. The purpose of the present report is to further characterize carbohydrate metabolism during reflow by describing rates of glucose oxidation using [6-14C]glucose. Oxidative performance was determined with and without preserved fatty acid utilization; the latter condition was effected by oxfenicine, which inhibits palmitoylcarnitine transferase I. In the main protocol, two groups of working swine hearts (n = 18) were perfused aerobically for 30 minutes, rendered regionally ischemic (-60 delta % in anterior descending coronary flow) for 45 minutes, and reperfused at control flows for a final 50 minutes of perfusion. An emulsion of Intralipid with heparin was administered systemically throughout the studies to augment serum fatty acids (average fatty acid values, 1.05 +/- 0.05 mumol/ml for both groups). Serum glucose was monitored and maintained at or about 100 mg/dl with additional infusions of glucose as needed. Oxfenicine (33 mg/kg) was administered systemically by bolus injection at time 0 and 60 minutes of perfusion in nine animals. Decreased mechanical performance, that is, stunning, during reflow was evident in both groups (-50 delta % in regional systolic shortening, p less than or equal to 0.05 compared with aerobic values in the control group, and -32 delta %, p less than or equal to 0.05 compared with aerobic values in treated hearts).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the vasodilator minoxidil sulfate (MNXS) were examined in isolated smooth muscle cells and strips from rabbit portal vein. At micromolar concentrations, MNXS inhibited norepinephrine (0.1-1.0 microM)-induced contractions in isolated muscle strips. In isolated cells, norepinephrine caused a dose-dependent depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which was significantly attenuated by MNXS (5 microM); MNXS alone caused a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. This hyperpolarization was insensitive to Na+-K+ pump blockade by ouabain, but was inhibited by the K+ channel antagonist, tetraethylammonium (20 mM). In voltage-clamp experiments, a resting (background) conductance associated with the resting membrane potential was identified. This conductance, which previously has been shown to be reduced by Ba2+ as well as tetraethylammonium, was increased by MNXS (2 microM). In additional experiments, whole-cell L-type Ca2+ currents were inhibited by micromolar concentrations of MNXS. These experiments show that concentrations of MNXS that inhibit norepinephrine-induced contractions promote K+ conductance and inhibit Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. These electrophysiological effects of MNXS may be responsible for the vasorelaxant effects of the drug observed in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Ultrasonic crystals placed in ischemic and control myocardium were used to measure systolic wall thickening during a 15-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery and for 3 hours after reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow was measured with tracer-labeled microspheres before occlusion, after 10 minutes of occlusion, 3 minutes of reperfusion, and at 1 and 3 hours after reperfusion. Six animals receiving anti-Mo1 antibody had antibody excess demonstrated with immunofluorescence techniques at 5 minutes and 3 hours of reperfusion; this finding indicated saturation of binding sites. Five animals served as controls and received an antibody (murine immunoglobulin G) that does not influence neutrophils. The two groups did not differ hemodynamically during ischemia and reperfusion. Risk areas and myocardial blood flow were also not significantly different between the two groups. The main parameter used to define regional myocardial stunning, percentage systolic wall thickening in the ischemic/reperfused area, did not differ significantly between the two groups. Specimens from nonischemic myocardium were compared with ischemic specimens for myeloperoxidase content. There were no significant differences within or between groups. These data indicate that the anti-Mo1 monoclonal antibody (904) is not effective in improving the profound myocardial dysfunction that persists for 3 hours of reperfusion after 15 minutes of ischemia.\r"

The experiments were performed on renal arteries that had been isolated from adult rats, chemically sympathectomized, mechanically denuded from endothelium and mounted under distension. Exposure of arterial segments for up to 3 weeks to culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum resulted in the following consecutive changes: a strong acute contraction, selective pharmacological changes that included decreased contractile responses to phenylephrine and vasopressin and increased relaxing responses to isoproterenol, increased incorporation of BrdUrd, a progressive fall in contractile responses to all vasoconstrictor stimuli, and an increase in excitability. Serum-free medium resulted in a much smaller acute arterial contraction, induced less incorporation of BrdUrd, accelerated the occurrence of hyperexcitability, but did not affect early pharmacological changes or the subsequent fall in overall arterial contractility with tissue culture. Dialysis of the serum or addition of ketanserin abolished the contractile effect of serum but did not affect the incorporation of BrdUrd or the loss of contractility with tissue culture. Addition of serotonin to serum-free culture medium mimicked the contractile response to serum but not the stimulation of BrdUrd incorporation. These data indicate that tissue culture alters the properties of the arterial wall, that contraction does not underlie the proliferative response of arterial smooth muscle to serum-derived mitogens in vitro, and that stimulation of DNA synthesis does in itself not lead to selective changes in arterial contractility.\r"

The beta-receptor density in crude sarcolemma prepared from left ventricular myocardium was 110.0 +/- 15.3 fmol/mg in the unmatched donors and 52.1 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg in the excised failing hearts.

Highly purified canine myocytic sarcolemma were peroxidized by a superoxide-driven (from dihydroxyfumarate) and Fe3+-catalyzed free radical-generating system. Hydroxyl radicals (.OH), identified by electron spin resonance signals as DMPO-OH adducts, were generated in the aqueous phase. Propranolol up to 500 microM did not effectively reduce the intensity of the DMPO-OH adducts. When the sarcolemma were incubated with MNP before the addition of free radicals, MNP adducts characteristic of carbon-centered radicals were produced. Pretreatment of the membranes with propranolol (3-100 microM) decreased the intensity of the MNP adducts in a log concentration-dependent manner; the EC50 is about 7 microM. D- and L-propranolol were found equally effective. When protein-depleted sarcolemmal lipids were similarly incubated with MNP and the free radical system, identical MNP adducts were observed; this finding suggests that the adducts were lipid-derived products arising from lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, their formation was also inhibited by propranolol pretreatment. Since propranolol is not an effective scavenger of oxygen radicals in the aqueous phase, the data suggest that the antiperoxidative effect of propranolol is due to its lipophilic interaction with the membrane and thus subsequent interruption of the free radical chain reactions.\r"

The rate of 86Rb uptake in the presence of ouabain was used as a measure of potassium conductance. Treatment of cells with rotenone plus p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) rapidly depleted ATP levels and strongly stimulated the rate of 86Rb uptake. The stimulated uptake and the ATP depletion were inhibited by oligomycin; thus, the uptake was not induced by rotenone plus FCCP directly. The stimulated uptake, but not the ATP depletion, was inhibited potently by glyburide (IC50, 38.3 nM), quinidine (IC50, 2.7 microM), verapamil (IC50, 4.5 microM), and amiodarone (IC50, 19.1 microM). The stimulated uptake was also inhibited by tetraethylammonium ion and by 4-aminopyridine but not by tetrodotoxin or manganese. We conclude that 1) the stimulated 86Rb uptake is measuring ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity, 2) the ATP-sensitive potassium channel is strongly inhibited by quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone, and 3) this inhibition may contribute to the antiarrhythmic action of these drugs.\r"

Twelve weeks after surgery to induce hypertension, in vivo arteriolar and venular dimensions were measured in the cremaster muscle of rats with one-kidney, one-clip hypertension (1K1C), rats in which the clip was removed after 8 weeks (1KNT), and controls. Systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated after 3 days in 1K1C rats and reached a plateau by 6 weeks. In 1KNT rats, systolic blood pressures were similar to 1K1C rats but were normalized 1 day after unclipping. A marked medial-intimal hypertrophy was found by histological techniques in the thoracic and abdominal aortae (45% and 69%, respectively) but not in cremaster feeding arteries of 1K1C rats. These arterial changes were reversed after unclipping. In 1K1C rats, medial-intimal area decreased in first- through fourth-order (1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A) arterioles along with a decline in relaxed diameter (41%, 30%, 20%, and 21%, respectively), which was only partially restored after unclipping. Heart weight was increased by 67% in 1K1C rats, but it did not differ between 1KNT and controls. Therefore, the reversal of chronic renal hypertension can normalize gross structural alterations in the heart and large vessels, but more time may be required to normalize completely the arteriolar changes. These data indicate that long-term structural adaptations in renal hypertension are different in arterioles and arteries, and they may be related to chronic changes in blood flow and/or pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The ionic mechanisms of amantadine-induced changes in membrane potential and automatic activity in guinea pig ventricular myocytes were studied using the suction-pipette whole-cell clamp method. While 25-100 microM amantadine decreased the action potential amplitude and duration, 200 and 400 microM amantadine lengthened the action potential duration and decreased the maximum diastolic potential with an appearance of diastolic depolarization and automaticity. In the presence of 25-100 microM amantadine, the preparations developed an afterpotential due to incomplete repolarization and a delayed afterdepolarization that eventually brought about triggered automaticity. The former type of afterpotential was abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the latter by Co2+. Spontaneous activity from the diastolic depolarization was also abolished by Co2+ but not by Cs+. Amantadine suppressed the calcium current to as much as half of the control at the concentrations used (25-200 microM). The drug also produced a depression of the inward rectifier K+ current. The outward current showing time-dependent decay was activated at the plateau voltages by concentrations lower than 100 microM, whereas the delayed outward K+ current was depressed by the drug in a concentration-dependent manner at more positive potentials. Amantadine activated the TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive inward currents on repolarization from depolarized states, without producing the transient inward current. These results indicate that the amantadine-induced diastolic depolarization and afterpotentials are caused by changes in multiple ionic currents and that, therefore, the drug can be used as a unique model for the study of arrhythmogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of extracellular acidosis on contraction of single isolated ventricular cells from rabbit was measured in a system in which pHo could be changed in less than 200 msec. The contractile response to acidotic levels was complete within 25 seconds. The response was measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased to 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5 at each of 8 [Ca]o levels (0.125-4.0 mM). Cell shortening versus [Ca]o was plotted to construct a curve for each pHo level, with each point relative to shortening at pH 7.5, [Ca]o = 1 mM (100% value). Calcium current (1 mM [Ca]o) was also measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased from 7.5 to 6.5 with single-cell patch clamp technique. The contractile response to extracellular acidosis is accurately predicted by assuming two (probably sarcolemmal) sites at which H+ ions affect calcium binding and/or flux: (equation; see text) The first factor represents a set of sites that are proposed to control access, dependent on the degree of their ionization, to sites represented by the second factor. The latter sites are proposed to accept calcium according to mass-action law. The response of calcium channel current to extracellular acidosis was also complete and reversible within 25 seconds. The current response indicates that the two-site model could be predictive for the effect of extracellular acidosis on calcium current in ventricular cells.\r"

Electrical field stimulation induced tetrodotoxin-sensitive relaxations in guanethidine-pretreated BMAs. The relaxation occurred after a delay of about 5-8 seconds and amounted to 25-35% in different sets of experiments. The relaxation was not affected by classical receptor antagonists such as atropine (1 microM), cimetidine (3.9 microM), clemastine (2.8 microM), naloxone (1.2 microM), 8-phenyltheophylline (1 microM), propranolol (3.4 microM), ritanserin (5 microM), or droperidol (13 microM). The nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor stimulant 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (10 microM) was without effect on the relaxation, and removal of the endothelium of the arteries also had no effect. The bee venom component apamin (1 microM), which has been shown to block the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic relaxation in intestinal and vascular smooth muscle from other species, was also found to be without effect on the relaxation induced by electrical field stimulation in BMAs. Pretreatment of the arteries with capsaicin (1 microM) had no effect per se and did not affect the relaxation induced by a subsequent stimulation. Capsaicin has been suggested to release neurotransmitter and eventually deplete neurons containing substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Furthermore, exogenously applied calcitonin gene-related peptide (1-100 nM), substance P (10 nM-1 microM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (0.3-30 nM) gave relaxations amounting to less than 10%. It is postulated that electrical field stimulation induces a neurogenic relaxation of a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nature in BMAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under control conditions (0.2 Hz, pH 7.4) total heat and steady-state force production due to 120 twitches were 1.0 +/- 0.4 J/g and 29.5 +/- 5.1 mN/mm2 (mean +/- SD; n = 5), respectively. Increasing the CO2 of the bicarbonate-buffered superfusate from 5% (pH 7.4) to 24% (pH 6.6) led to a decrease of force and heat production, 54% and 72%, respectively, of the control value. The recovery heat-time constant, reflecting the time course of oxidative phosphorylation, increased from 23.0 +/- 5.1 seconds at pH 7.4 to 69.5 +/- 34.7 seconds at pH 6.6. The ratio of recovery and initial heat equaled 1.06 under both conditions. Enhancing the metabolic rate by increasing the stimulation frequency to 1.0 Hz led, after an initial maximum, to a decline of force and heat presumably as the consequence of shortage of oxygen in the muscle core. The recovery phase in this case was characterized by a double exponential function having time constants of 7.6 and 64.4 seconds. When pH was lowered to 6.6 together with the enhancement of the stimulation frequency to 1 Hz, an additional exothermal process, unrelated to force production, was observed during contraction and for some time thereafter. It was concluded that severe acidosis slows down the rate of oxidative phosphorylation and may reduce the economy of contraction. However, it does not change the nature of recovery and initial heat processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rabbit peritoneal PMNs (4 x 10(3)-4 x 10(5) cells/ml) added to muscle bath chambers containing phenylephrine-precontracted rabbit isolated aortic rings produced no effect on vascular tone. However, when PMNs were activated with the chemotactic peptide, f-met-leu-phe (0.1 microM), PMNs produced concentration-dependent vascular contraction, which was dependent on the presence of the endothelium. Aortic rings denuded of endothelium were unaffected by activated PMNs. Superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml) treatment of tissues blocked completely PMN-induced vascular contraction, whereas mannitol (20 mM) had no significant effect on PMN-induced vascular contraction. Pyrogallol (a generator of superoxide anion) produced a response that was similar to that observed with activated PMNs. Superoxide anion production was measured separately, and the time of peak rate of superoxide anion production corresponded to the time of the maximal vascular contractile responses. Activated PMNs added to vascular tissues undergoing endothelium-dependent relaxation mediated by either acetylcholine or A23187 produced a reversal of vascular relaxation. Furthermore, activated PMNs did not have any effect on endothelium-independent vascular relaxation produced by either isoproterenol or nitroglycerin. The present investigation reveals that activated PMNs can release superoxide anion and produce endothelium-dependent contraction. The endothelium-dependent contraction may be the result of superoxide anion inactivation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

The pressor response to the highest intracerebroventricular dose of AVP tested in Brattleboro rats (30 ng) was 46 +/- 13/21 +/- 6 mm Hg (n = 6). Intracerebroventricular AVP caused a tachycardia in Brattleboro rats but had no effect on heart rate of Long Evans rats. At doses greater than 1 ng, the increases in blood pressure produced by intracisternal AVP in both groups of rats were significantly greater than the increases produced by the same doses given intracerebroventricularly. Heart rate fell in a dose-dependent manner after intracisternal AVP in Long Evans rats but not in Brattleboro rats. Cardiac baroreflex sensitivities of Brattleboro rats were not significantly different from those of Long Evans rats and were not modified by intracerebroventricular (0.3 ng) or intracisternal (0.1 ng) AVP. In Long Evans rats, intracisternal AVP (0.3 ng) increased cardiac baroreflex responses to both increases and decreases in pressure. Intracerebroventricular AVP (0.3 ng) increased the sensitivity of the reflex in response to an elevation but not to a reduction in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cyclosporine, 25 mg/kg/day, was administered subcutaneously daily on days 10-31 (experiment 1) and days 30-51 (experiment 2). Treated groups were compared with infected controls for each experiment. In experiment 1, the survival rate of the cyclosporine-treated group was low (17/25 vs. 24/25, p less than 0.05). The severity of myocardial lesions and the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in myocardium and spleen on days 15-18 did not differ between treated and control groups; on the other hand, the percentages of peripheral Thy 1.2+ (pan T) and L3T4+ (activated helper T) cells on days 15-18 were decreased in the treated group, and those of B, Lyt 1+ (helper/inducer T), and Lyt 2+ (suppressor/cytotoxic T) subsets did not differ significantly. Notably, myocardial interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) positive cells, through which cyclosporine is considered to act, were scarce in both groups. In experiment 2, survival rates of two groups did not differ (treated, 32/34; untreated, 34/34; p = NS). The severity of myocardial lesions and the distribution of splenic lymphocyte subsets on days 35-38 also were not different between two groups. The percentages of peripheral lymphocyte subsets (Thy 1.2+ and L3T4+) were decreased in the treated group; those of B, Lyt 1+, and Lyt 2+ subsets did not differ significantly. In experiments 1 and 2, the thymus/body weight ratio in the treated groups was smaller than in the untreated group, but the spleen/body weight ratio in the treated group did not differ from the untreated group; histologically, medullary cellular depletion was evident in the thymus, not in the spleen, of the treated groups. We conclude that cyclosporine failed to change the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in the spleen as well as in the myocardium in CB3 myocarditis although it had effects on the peripheral blood and thymus, which may account for the higher mortality in the treated groups. The absence of beneficial effects of cyclosporine upon the CB3-infected myocardium may be related to the paucity of cyclosporine-sensitive cells (IL-2R, L3T4, and Lyt 2 positive cells) in the myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, chest compression with an unobstructed trachea raises and maintains intrathoracic pressure by collapsing airways and trapping air in the lung, we studied 11 dogs (20-32 kg). An inflatable vest compressed the thorax after induction of ventricular fibrillation. First, tracheal airflow was measured by a pneumotachometer during vest inflation and deflation in nine of the dogs. As expected, during the initial phase of vest inflation of cycles after ventilation, air moved out of the lungs, but then airflow stopped. After vest deflation, however, more air moved out of the lungs in eight of the nine dogs; this occurrence indicated that a portion of the inspired tidal volume was trapped during vest inflation. During cycles without prior ventilation, the amount of air expired by chest compression decreased, paradoxically, at higher peak vest pressure (p less than 0.002); this occurrence indicated that air was trapped at the higher vest pressures. The change in right atrial pressure was higher on cycles after ventilation than on cycles without prior ventilation (79 +/- 12 vs. 67 +/- 12 mm Hg [mean +/- SEM], p less than 0.005), and lung volume was higher on cycles after ventilation (p less than 0.001). Next, a 5-Fr micromanometer was advanced down the airway in eight of the dogs. With the tip of the micromanometer 5-8 cm distal to the carina, a zone of high pressure was noted in seven dogs; this high pressure suggested a zone of airway collapse distal to the carina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmias that accompany myocardial infarction in dogs may be secondary to the altered electrophysiological properties of the subendocardial Purkinje fibers that survive 24 hours after the coronary occlusion. To better understand the ionic mechanisms that underlie the altered electrical activity of these fibers, we have dispersed, using an enzymatic technique, Purkinje cells from the subendocardium of the infarcted ventricle (IZPCs) and compared their electrical and structural properties to Purkinje cells dispersed from fiber strands (SPCs) and from the subendocardium of the noninfarcted ventricle (NZPCs). Ultrastructural analysis of these cells shows that IZPCs contain an increased number of lipid droplets when compared with the SPCs and NZPCs. In addition, transmembrane action potentials of IZPCs have reduced resting potentials, action potential amplitudes, and upstroke velocity and are increased in duration when compared with either SPCs or NZPCs. Input resistance of IZPCs is increased over that measured in control cells (SPCs and NZPCs). Furthermore, the time course of the process of electrical restitution of action potential duration is altered in IZPCs with long action potentials. Finally, using K+-sensitive microelectrode techniques, we have determined that intracellular free K+ activity (aKi) in IZPCs (93.7 +/- 15 mM) is not significantly different from control aKi measurements (SPC, 106 +/- 13 mM; NZPC, 103 +/- 12 mM). Thus a reduction in aKi does not provide a basis for the reduced resting potentials observed in IZPCs. By studying the relation between the resting potential and log [K+]o we determined that in IZPCs with reduced resting potentials, there is a significant increase in the PNa/PK ratio when compared with control. In summary, to better understand the cellular basis of ventricular arrhythmias postinfarction, we have developed a single cell model that will allow for more rigorous electrophysiological studies of the specific ionic currents that underlie the abnormal electrophysiology.\r"

The findings were compared with results in littermates with compensated LV hypertrophy and with a third group of normal dogs. At rest, there was a marked difference in the intramyocardial distribution of coronary flow, measured with radiolabeled microspheres. The endocardial/epicardial (endo/epi) flow ratio in the LV failure dogs was 0.96 +/- 0.08 as compared with control dogs (1.28 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05) or dogs with compensated LV hypertrophy (1.23 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.05). During near-maximal coronary vasodilation with adenosine, all groups showed similar increases in subepimyocardial (epi) flow. While significant increases in subendomyocardial (endo) flow during adenosine infusion were seen in the control group (0.88 +/- 0.10 to 3.53 +/- 0.24 ml/min/g) and in dogs with compensated LV hypertrophy (1.12 +/- 0.14 to 3.60 +/- 0.16 ml/min/g), there was no change in endo flow in the LV failure dogs (1.55 +/- 0.20 to 1.71 +/- 0.47 ml/min/g) and a further significant reduction in the endo/epi flow ratio was observed (0.30 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.01). These hemodynamic changes were associated with chronic multifocal interstitial or discrete areas of fibrosis observed preferentially in endo layers. Thus, endo flow reserve is nearly exhausted in dogs with decompensated pressure overload LV hypertrophy, which may induced periodic episodes of endo ischemia resulting in myocyte necrosis and fibrosis, which in turn results in exacerbation of LV failure.\r"

Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing [32P]Pk and freeze-clamped at different times during the positive inotropic response. Exposure of the hearts to 0.1 microM isoproterenol for up to 1 minute was associated with significant (up to threefold) increases in phospholamban and troponin I phosphorylation, but there was no significant increase in 32P incorporation into phospholipids. However, longer exposure (2 minutes or more) to isoproterenol was associated with increases in the degree of 32P labeling of phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acid. Examination of 32P labeling of inositol trisphosphates in the same hearts revealed that the radioactivity associated with these compounds decreased with time. The decreases were significant at times of exposure of 2 minutes or longer to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The tissue levels of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate isoform were also measured in hearts perfused with isoproterenol for 3 minutes, and they were found to be significantly lower compared with values obtained in control hearts. The effects of isoproterenol on 32P incorporation into phospholipids and proteins were observed in the presence of prazosin, and they were completely abolished by the beta-receptor blocker propranolol. Examination of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity in the perfused hearts revealed that isoproterenol stimulation was associated with a decrease in the membrane-associated enzymatic activity at physiological calcium concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To quantitate the rates of permeation via these two routes of transport across capillary wall, we have developed a linear model for transendothelial transport and illustrated its suitability for the design and analysis of multiple simultaneous indicator dilution curves from an organ. Data should be obtained for at least three solutes: 1) an intravascular reference, albumin; 2) a solute transported by endothelial cells; and 3) another reference solute, of the same molecular size as solute 2, which neither binds nor traverses cell membranes. The capillary-tissue convection-permeation model is spatially distributed and accounts for axial variation in concentrations, transport through and around endothelial cells, accumulation and consumption within them, exchange with the interstitium and parenchymal cells, and heterogeneity of regional flows. The upslope of the dilution curves is highly sensitive to unidirectional rate of loss at the luminal endothelial surface. There is less sensitivity to transport across the antiluminal surface, except when endothelial retention is low. The model is useful for receptor kinetics using tracers during steady-state conditions and allows distinction between equilibrium binding and reaction rate limitations. Uptake rates at the luminal surface are readily estimated by fitting the model to the experimental dilution curves. For adenosine and fatty acids, endothelial transport accounts for 30-99% of the transcapillary extraction.\r"

Results of defibrillation testing were used to derive 50% and 90% successful energy requirements (ED50 and ED90) using logistic regression and were compared with analysis of variance.

Right-sided congestive heart failure was produced in 16 dogs by tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary artery constriction. Seven sham-operated dogs were included for comparison. Baroreflex function was measured in the conscious dogs after pretreatment with either normal saline or an opiate-receptor antagonist by bolus administration of phenylephrine. The slope of the regression line relating systolic blood pressure to cardiac cycle (R-R) interval was taken as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. Plasma beta-endorphin was elevated in the dogs with heart failure (15.3 +/- 2.5 pmol/l) compared with the sham-operated dogs (4.2 +/- 0.4 pmol/l, p less than 0.001). The dogs with heart failure also exhibited a reduced baroreflex sensitivity (3.84 +/- 0.19 msec/mm Hg) after saline pretreatment when compared with the sham-operated dogs (10.86 +/- 1.20 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.001).

To further study the site of action for the effect of naloxone, we measured baroreflex sensitivity in the dogs with heart failure after pretreatment with naloxonazine, a selective mu-receptor antagonist, with ICI 154,129, a selective delta-receptor antagonist, or with naloxone methobromide, a quaternary analogue of naloxone that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Afterload is varied by the inflation of an intra-aortic balloon catheter positioned in the ascending aorta. Balloon inflation is timed to interrupt ventricular ejection transiently at different times during the ejection phase, therefore, producing contraction at different ventricular volumes. Simultaneous measurement of left ventricular pressure and aortic flow during the occlusion sequence allows pressure versus ejected volume loops to be generated, from which the end-systolic pressure-volume relation is determined. End-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) was measured in six anesthetized Dorsett sheep with normal and enhanced contractile states. ESPVR was analyzed using both linear and nonlinear techniques. Although nonlinear components were seen in ESPVR, for the pressure-volume data range produced by the transient occlusions, linear approximations of ESPVR fit the end-systolic data points well. In the normal state, Emax, the slope of the linear ESPVR, was 1.01-5.08 mm Hg/ml in animals with body weights of 23-32 kg. After epinephrine infusion, Emax increased from 3.07 +/- 1.49 to 5.79 +/- 1.97 mm Hg/ml, which is consistent with previous investigations. Linear and nonlinear volume intercepts had a small increase with positive inotropic stimulation. Furthermore, serial measurements of Emax tracked cardiac function in depressed hearts with rapidly changing contractility.\r"

Angiograms were obtained before, 10 minutes after, and 28 days after BA and read by two blinded observers using electronic calipers. The in vivo balloon-to-vessel ratio was measured for each group. There were eight non-BA controls. Rabbits were sacrificed either immediately (n = 34) or at 28 days after BA (n = 36), with the femoral vessels pressure perfused for histologic and morphometric analysis. The latter was performed at 28 days only. Absolute angiographic diameters increased in all groups immediately after BA (p less than 0.01). Acute angiographic success, defined as greater than 20% increase in luminal diameter, was higher using high inflation pressure (group 2, 32/36 [89%] and group 4, 16/19 [84%] vs. group 1, 23/35 [66%] and group 3, 9/17 [53%]; p less than 0.05). A 3.0-mm balloon resulted in significant oversizing irrespective of inflation pressure (balloon-to-vessel ratio, 1.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 to 1, for the 2.5-mm balloon). Vessels exposed to high inflation pressure had a significantly higher incidence of mural thrombus, dissection (p less than 0.01), and medial necrosis versus low pressure (p less than 0.05). At 28 days, the rates of restenosis (defined as greater than 50% loss of initial gain) were 14/20 (70%), 11/16 (69%), 5/10 (50%), and 5/10 (50%) for groups 1 through 4 (p = NS; a trend in favor of the groups using an oversized balloon). There was an increase in the degree of intimal hyperplasia by morphometric analysis in all groups, being most marked in group 2 (oversized balloon and high inflation pressure, 1.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.2 mm for controls, p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "We investigated the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in response to serotonin and histamine in the human internal mammary artery and saphenous vein. The arteries and veins were obtained intraoperatively and were suspended in organ chambers to record isometric tension. In mammary arteries, histamine (10(-8) to 3 X 10(-6) M) induced relaxations in rings with (70 +/- 5%, IC50, 6.5 +/- 0.2) but not without endothelium (p less than 0.005 for rings with compared with those without endothelium, n = 7-10). The response was inhibited by methylene blue or hemoglobin, but not meclofenamate, and, therefore, EDRF was delineated as the mediator. Because chlorpheniramine but not cimetidine inhibited the response, EDRF was released by the H1-histaminergic receptor (n = 5-8). In contrast, in saphenous veins, histamine caused only weak or absent endothelium-dependent relaxations, but contractions were enhanced in rings with endothelium (p less than 0.05, n = 6). Serotonin did not induce endothelium-dependent relaxations, but contractions were markedly greater in veins compared with arteries (p less than 0.005, n = 6). The endothelium inhibited the maximal contraction to serotonin in arteries (p less than 0.034) but not in veins. Thus, EDRF protects against contractions induced by histamine and serotonin in the mammary artery but not in the saphenous vein. This may be important for improved graft function and patency of the artery compared with that of the vein.\r"
