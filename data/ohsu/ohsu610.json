The faculty members who conduct the workshops have received training on how to present them. The most powerful learning experience offered by TIPS is the opportunity for participants to present 10-minute teaching segments that are videotaped and later viewed privately by the participants. Eight workshops have been attended by 166 faculty members, and two others have been attended by 42 residents. This project demonstrates faculty development for both the participants and the people who teach the workshops.\r"

  ".U": "89028001\r", 
  ".W": "Dehydrated patients usually present with an elevated serum urea level, owing in part to increased renal reabsorption of urea mediated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). We carried out a study to examine whether, during dehydration, the variations in the serum urea level could discriminate patients with central diabetes insipidus (CDI) from those with dehydration not due to CDI. We studied retrospectively 27 episodes of dehydration in 23 patients with CDI and 14 episodes in 14 patients without CDI. The mean serum urea level was 2.9 mmol/L in the CDI group and 15.4 mmol/L in the patients without CDI (p less than 0.001); the mean serum sodium level was 155 mmol/L in both groups. All the patients with CDI had a sodium/urea ratio greater than 24.2, whereas the ratio was less than 21.7 in all the patients without CDI. In the patients with CDI a positive correlation was found between the magnitude of diuresis and the percentage decrease in the serum urea level compared with the level before dehydration (p less than 0.001). In the patients with CDI the serum urea level returned to the level before dehydration after the administration of vasopressin; a striking increase in the clearance of urea, which exceeded the creatinine clearance, was observed during dehydration in the three patients in whom clearance studies were done. The results suggest that serum urea values can be used to distinguish patients dehydrated because of CDI from those with hypertonic dehydration but without ADH deficiency and that during dehydration the net reabsorption of urea is dependent on the renal action of ADH.\r"

Studies have shown that the time that patients take to decide to seek help accounts for most of the delay. We documented the length of time from onset of symptoms to arrival in hospital for 201 patients consecutively admitted to one of four hospitals in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton between October 1986 and February 1987 for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Of the 160 survivors 42% waited more than 4 hours (a critical time for effective thrombolytic therapy) before coming to hospital, and nearly a third did not arrive within 6 hours. On the basis of interviews conducted with 42 patients, sociodemographic factors, education, past experience with an acute myocardial infarction, a previous diagnosis of angina and a coronary-prone behaviour pattern did not explain the delay. How patients perceived the seriousness of their symptoms and how they used other illness-related coping strategies explained 46% of the variance in the delay. Interventions aimed at reducing the delay between onset of symptoms and treatment must focus on patients' preadmission behaviour.\r"

Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration provides control of fluid and electrolyte balance but is inefficient in the management of azotemia. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) combines dialysis with hemofiltration. We performed 15 CAVHD treatments of 2 or more days' duration in 12 critically ill patients aged 23 to 85 (mean 64.4) years who had acute oliguric renal failure as a component of multiple organ system failure and who were unsuitable for conventional hemodialysis. The total treatment time was 106 days. The serum creatinine and urea levels were controlled in all the patients during CAVHD. The ultrafiltrate losses were sufficient to allow appropriate nutrition and fluid administration and still maintain a negative fluid balance. Renal function returned in five patients (42%), of whom four survived to be discharged home. CAVHD is an effective means of managing acute oliguric renal failure in critically ill patients.\r"

In the second phase of the study, patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors received sequential courses of methotrexate and vinblastine. Other patients, who were estrogen receptor-positive or unknown, were randomized to receive either tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen plus methotrexate and vinblastine. All therapy was completed within 1 year. The estimated disease-free rate at 5 years was 68% among patients with Stage II disease and 52% for patients who had Stage III disease. Among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, disease-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients who received methotrexate and vinblastine in addition to tamoxifen (P = 0.04). However, this difference was less pronounced when all randomized patients (including those whose estrogen receptor status was unknown) were included in the comparison. Although most patients experienced moderate to severe granulocytopenia, infectious complications were infrequent. One patient died of septicemia. Congestive heart failure developed in two patients, one of whom had a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.\r"

At the conclusion of 16 cycles of chemotherapy, all treatment was stopped. Patients were assessed for toxicity and disease response after each treatment. Duration of response and survival rate were determined for 41 evaluable patients. The overall response rate was 80% with 24% complete responses, 15% to PAC alone. Median duration of response (8 months) and median survival (17 months) were not superior to other reported multiagent chemotherapeutic programs. Toxicity included neutropenic fever, sepsis, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalance. Administration of sequential multiagent chemotherapy with a cisplatin-containing combination did not improve response rate, complete responses (CR), duration of response, or survival in this group of previously untreated breast cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-one maxillary carcinoma patients who survived more than 10 years after initial treatment were surveyed. Performance status was unrestricted in 35.1% of the patients, slightly restricted in 34.5%, moderately restricted in 21.1%, restricted in 7.0%, and very restricted in 2.3%. Radiation-induced cataracts on the affected side occurred in 100% of the patients treated with radiation. Good visual acuity was maintained in only 65.8% of the patients, even on the contralateral side. Fifty-five percent of the patients retained symmetric facial animation due to our policy of conservative therapy. Restricted mouth opening occurred in 32.2% of the patients, taking liquid diet in 21.1%, and middle ear effusion in 26.3%, which were closely linked to maxillectomy operation. This study suggests that avoiding excess radiation dosage, strict control of radiation field, adaption of two portals with 60 grades wedge pair filter, use of appropriate protectors, limiting removal at the maxillactomy, and postoperative care for trismus or tympanic effusion are necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The candidacidal activity and the production of oxygen radicals by monocytes were investigated in untreated and long-term remission patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). Both groups showed a decreased candidacidal function of monocytes with a chemiluminescence (CL) response significantly lower and delayed with respect to normal controls. Indomethacin at 1 microgram/ml corrected the monocyte deficiency increasing the CL response to normal values and normalizing the kinetics in the untreated patients. However, in patients in remission, the peak was delayed and followed by a significant increase in the production of oxygen radicals compared with untreated patients. A direct linear correlation was found between the percentages of lysed Candida and maximum CL peak of stimulated monocytes. When prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) levels, measured in supernatants of cultured mononuclear cells, were plotted against the percentages of killed Candida, an inverse linear correlation was found. Therefore, monocytes from HD patients have a dysfunction in the generation of oxygen radicals and a decreased candidacidal activity associated with excessive production of PGE-2. Indomethacin can correct the oxidative metabolism in the untreated patients while in apparently \"cured\" patients the disorder persists.\r"

  ".W": "Mammary angiosarcoma appears to be a heterogeneous group of neoplasms morphologically, in which growth pattern or grade is an important prognostic factor. In this report, 63 patients whose slides were seen in consultation and/or who were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) are described. Included are 32 MSKCC patients from an earlier study (with additional follow-up for 15 who are alive) and 31 new cases. Twenty-five (40%) patients had low-grade (Type I) lesions (including the only man in the series), 12 (19%) patients had intermediate-grade (Type II) tumors, and 26 (41%) patients had high-grade (Type III) angiosarcomas. Because prognosis is significantly related to the type of angiosarcoma, the lesion should be thoroughly studied microscopically to establish tumor type. Estimated probabilities of disease-free survival 5 years after initial treatment were as follows: Type I: 76%; Type II: 70%; and Type III: 15%. The median length of disease-free survival also was related to tumor type (Type I: greater than 15 years; Type II: greater than 12 years; and Type III: 15 months). Pretreatment duration of the lesion and primary tumor size were not significantly related to the risk of recurrence or to survival. Total mastectomy is recommended for most mammary angiosarcomas. Adjuvant chemotherapy was used in 31 of 63 (49%) patients and, in this group, recurrences developed in 14 (45%) patients. Among 32 (51%) patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, 18 (56%) had recurrences. Whereas the few long-term survivors with Type III tumors received adjuvant chemotherapy, recurrences developed in most patients with comparable lesions who were given this treatment. Because Type III angiosarcoma has a poor prognosis, such treatment may be appropriate for these patients. We were unable to demonstrate that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis for patients with Type I and Type II tumors, although recurrences tended to be less frequent among treated patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study determines the effectiveness and reproducibility of a previously published method of grading gliomas. The method under study is for use on \"ordinary astrocytoma\" cell types, i.e., fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, and is based upon the recognition of the presence or absence of four morphologic criteria: nuclear atypia, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis. The method results in a summary score which is translated into a grade as follows: 0 criteria = grade 1, 1 criterion = grade 2, 2 criteria = grade 3, 3 or 4 criteria = grade 4. The histologic material and clinical data were derived from a previously reported series of patients with astrocytomas, radiotherapeutically treated at Mayo Clinic between the years 1960 and 1969. From this series, initially graded 1 to 4, according to the Kernohan system, 287 \"ordinary astrocytomas\" were entered into the study; 51 pilocytic astrocytomas and microcystic cerebellar-type astrocytomas also were included for comparison. Among ordinary astrocytomas, the grading method under study distinguished 0.7% of grade 1, 17% of grade 2, 18% of grade 3, and 65.3% of grade 4. A 15-year period of follow-up was available on all surviving patients. Statistical analysis showed that in ordinary astrocytomas, each of the four histologic criteria, as well as the resultant grade, were strongly correlated to survival (P less than 0.0001). Median survival was 4 years in grade 2, 1.6 years in grade 3, and 0.7 years in grade 4 tumors. Of the two patients with grade 1 ordinary astrocytomas, 1 had 11 years of survival, and the other was alive at 15 years. Furthermore, based upon the Cox Model, grade was found to be the major prognostic factor, superceding the effects of age, sex, and location. Among ordinary astrocytomas, the grading system under consideration clearly distinguished four distinct grades of malignancy, whereas, the Kernohan grading system accurately distinguished only two major groups of patients. Survival curve of patients with our grade 2 tumors coincided with the grade 1 and 2 Kernohan survival curves. Similarly, our grade 4 survival curve coincided with the Kernohan grade 3 and 4 survival curves. As a result, our proposed grading method generated an individualized curve corresponding to grade 3 tumors. Double-blind grading between two independent observers was concordant in 94% of ordinary astrocytomas; reproducibility was 81% in low-grade (grades 1 and 2) and 96% in high-grade (grades 3 and 4) astrocytomas of ordinary type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Of the four histologic grades of epithelial dysplasia (focal mild, mild, moderate, and severe), most of the cases were diagnosed as mild (54.1%) and the fewest (8.1%) were in the severe category. The overall mean age at time of diagnosis was 56.7 years. A predilection for occurrence in males was confirmed, but a lower than expected incidence in blacks was noted. The most common anatomic sites were the buccal mucosa, palate, and floor of mouth. The anatomic areas which were most likely to have a severe epithelial dysplasia were the ventral surface of the tongue and the lip. Patients with dysplasias in more than one site had a slightly higher probability of being diagnosed as either moderate or severe. The cases associated with lichen planus usually were found on the buccal mucosa and demonstrated a shift toward a milder degree of dysplasia.\r"

The clinical course was rapid with tumor recurrence on the chest wall less than 1 month after mastectomy. Other cutaneous and abdominal metastases occurred shortly thereafter, and death followed within 3 months despite chemotherapy. The cultured cells, designated RW-972, produced large amounts of acid mucopolysaccharides (hyaluronic acid) and mimicked the aggressive growth characteristics seen in the patient. After injection into nude mice, the tumor grew rapidly and occasionally produced metastases. This unique cell line, RW-972, presumably derived from the stromal component of a human malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes, might be useful in studies of experimental therapy of this rare tumor type and of lobular stromal cells of breast. It may also be used to investigate hyaluronic acid production by tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "To optimize the prognostic value of DNA flow cytometry in breast cancer the authors calculated several parameters from the DNA histogram, including the DNA index, the size and number of aneuploid peaks as well as S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle fractions. Of these, DNA index and S-phase fraction (SPF) proved to be the most valuable prognostic indices. DNA aneuploidy was associated with a three-fold risk of death as compared to DNA diploidy (P less than 0.0001). The highest risk of death was associated with hypertetraploid (greater than 2.20) DNA index, whereas a tetraploid DNA index (1.80-2.20) was associated with a relatively low risk. The SPF had significant additional prognostic value in both DNA diploid (P = 0.0002) and DNA aneuploid (P = 0.02) tumors. By combining DNA index and SPF the authors defined three types of DNA histograms, which were associated with favorable, intermediate, and poor prognosis of the patients. DNA diploidy together with low (less than 7%) SPF (type I DNA histogram) was associated with very favorable prognosis, whereas DNA aneuploidy with high DNA index (greater than 2.20) or high (greater than 12%) SPF (type III DNA histogram) was related to the worst prognosis with approximately eight-fold relative risk of death. In a Cox multivariate regression analysis the type of DNA histogram was an independent and most powerful prognostic indicator in breast cancer. The other independent factors in the Cox analysis were primary tumor size, nodal status, and progesterone receptor status.\r"

  ".W": "Two thousand five hundred forty cases (1628 males and 912 females) of primary gastric cancer (GC) histologically diagnosed in gastroscopic biopsy or resected specimens, occurring from 1973 to 1982 in a high risk area in Italy (Florence), were reviewed. According to Lauren's criteria, 1587 (62.5%) were classified as intestinal type, 624 (24.6%) as diffuse type and 329 (12.9%) as mixed unclassified. The intestinal type is more frequent in males and increases in both sexes with advancing age; conversely for the diffuse type. In the two 5-year periods (1973-1977 and 1978-1982) the intestinal type shows a reduction over time more evident in females than in males, in contrast to the increasing trend for the diffuse type. In males, the distribution of Lauren's histologic types is stable over time for resected specimens, whereas there is a significant reduction of intestinal type for biopsy specimens. In females, both for resected and biopsy specimens there is a reduction of the intestinal type and an increase of the diffuse type from the first to the second period. For a subgroup of 297 subjects two different specimens were available (gastroscopic biopsy and surgical); sensitivity and positive predictive value, for biopsy specimen as compared with the resected one, in the diagnosis for Lauren's histologic types were calculated. An excess of diagnoses in the mixed/unclassified category for biopsy material was evident (positive predictive value = 44.3%). However, for the two main histologic types, the biopsy appears a quite reliable indicator of the final diagnosis on surgical material (intestinal: ppv = 88.6%; Diffuse: ppv = 87.0%). The study supports the hypothesis that the reduction in GC mortality in the Province of Florence in recent years may be associated with a moderate reduction in the frequency of the intestinal type.\r"

Although 14 of the lesions were detected preoperatively with confirmation by endoscopic biopsy, the other 26 remained unrecognized until the gross examination of the formalin-fixed specimens. Histologically, all were tubular adenomas of the intestinal type with varying degrees of epithelial atypia. Carcinoma in adenoma was present in 5% of these depressed lesions, in contrast to 2.5% of the conventional protruded adenoma. Thus, depressed adenoma seems to be a variant of gastric adenoma which has a somewhat higher malignant potential.\r"

Cases with limited BM deposition showed an overall significant shorter survival and were overrepresented in Dukes' Stages C/D. Stratification of the cases, for limited versus moderate/extensive BM deposition and Dukes' Stages A/B and C/D, showed that in Dukes' Stages C/D, cases with moderate/extensive BM deposition reached a plateau phase in the survival curve after 2 years. Cases with limited BM deposition showed a continuous downward course on the survival curve. The results suggest that immunostaining of BM in cases in Dukes' C differentiates tumors with relatively high invasive and metastatic capacity from tumors with low invasive and metastatic capacity.\r"

Data from 368 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 6.0 years) were analyzed to investigate the possibility that the histologic features of implants of this type of tumor may correlate with the prognosis. Eighty-five percent of the 56 patients were clinically free of tumor at the time of death or at last contact. Thirteen percent of the patients died of tumor, and one patient (2%) was alive with widespread progressive tumor. The product-limit estimate of the probability of death from tumor (+/- standard error) was 4% (+/- 3%) at 5 years and 23% (+/- 9%) at 10 years. The following three histologic features of the implants correlated with an adverse prognosis: (1) invasion (P = 0.0004), (2) severe cytologic atypia in both invasive and noninvasive implants (P = 0.0008) and in noninvasive implants alone (P = 0.02), and (3) the presence of mitotic activity in both types of implants (P = 0.02) and in noninvasive implants alone (P = 0.02). The only other feature that correlated with the prognosis was the presence of residual tumor postoperatively as assessed by the surgeon (P = 0.01). The product-limit estimate of death of tumor in patients with at least one of these four adverse prognostic factors was 56% (+/- 20%) at 10 years. Whether or not the patients received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both had no statistically significant effect on the outcome. These data and the results of a stratified analysis suggest that patients may benefit from additional therapy if adverse prognostic factors are present, especially invasiveness or severe cytologic atypia. It is unlikely that additional therapy is necessary in patients without adverse prognostic features, because no deaths occurred in this group.\r"

Although the hematoma resolved completely by the time that complete remission was achieved, an indurated, erythematous mass subsequently developed, which when biopsied revealed leukemic cells in the dermis. The patient had a relapse in her peripheral blood shortly thereafter. The authors reviewed recent literature and their own experience with CV catheters and report on localized dermal relapse as a previously unpublished risk of CV catheter placement. They also speculate on the role of the dermis as a sanctuary for leukemic cells and a potential source for relapsing disease.\r"

All patients underwent the same scheduled investigation program: history, physical examination, blood tests, bone scanning, bilateral iliac crest biopsy, radiologic bone survey, chest x-rays, and ultrasound scanning of the liver. The current article focuses on the diagnosis of intrathoracic (ITH) recurrence. Most patients recurred in a single site and 50% of the recurrences were diagnosed within the first 2 years from initial diagnosis. Chest x-ray revealed ITH recurrence in 27% (109 patients), and in 8% the lung, pleura, and/or mediastinum were the only signs of recurrence. Generally, the status of primary demographic, clinical, and pathoanatomical characteristics were not predictive as to the development of ITH recurrence, although patients with pleural recurrences often had centrally located primary tumors, locally advanced disease, and often received adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinical symptoms and signs of ITH recurrence were present in only one third of the patients, and the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of serum lactate dehydrogenase were only 33% and 85%, respectively. Since ITH recurrences often are silent, and since recurrence in this site may have both prognostic and therapeutical implications, routine chest x-ray is indicated in all patients with first recurrence of breast cancer.\r"

Tumor size was the major prognostic factor in the leiomyosarcoma group; five of eight patients with neoplasms measuring less than 5 cm in maximum dimension survived, whereas no patient with a larger tumor did so. Other pathologic and clinical variables, including mitotic rate, tumor necrosis, degree of nuclear pleomorphism, vascular invasion, and patient age, had no significant relationship to survival or tumor behavior in leiomyosarcoma when tumor size was taken into account. The nine cases of leiomyoma variants consisted of three atypical leiomyomas (which had nuclear pleomorphism, one or no mitotic figures per ten high-power fields, and no necrosis), two plexiform leiomyomas, two cases of peritoneal leiomyomatosis, one palisaded leiomyoma, and one case of intravenous leiomyomatosis; all of these patients were tumor-free on follow-up.\r"

Ten patients were retrospectively reviewed after having been clinically diagnosed without venography, and treated without anticoagulation. Five thromboembolic complications occurred, two of which proved fatal. Fifteen patients were prospectively evaluated by angiography and then treated with anticoagulants. Angiographic evidence of intraluminal subclavian vein or superior vena caval thrombosis was found in five of these patients, and no thromboembolic complications occurred. Of the 20 patients ultimately anticoagulated, two fatal intracranial hemorrhages developed. The authors suggest the need for randomized prospective trials if the role of venography and anticoagulation in this syndrome is to be determined.\r"

An inverse association was found between level of carotene intake and lung cancer risk, and this protective effect was specific for squamous and small cell carcinoma (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.09, high intake). A stronger protective effect for these tumors was associated with dietary vitamin C intake (OR = 0.65, 0.50-0.87, high intake). A significant inverse gradient in risk with retinol intake was limited to adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.64, 0.44-0.94, high intake) and more pronounced among blacks.\r"

The material consisted of 4980 cases of melanoma of the skin diagnosed in Finland in 1953 to 1981 and reported to the Finnish Cancer Registry. In the last diagnostic period, 1974 to 1982, the 5-year relative survival rate for male patients was 61.1% and that for female patients 76.6%. The analysis included variables sex, age, stage, year of diagnosis, follow-up year, and site of the tumor. All of them were needed to explain the differences in survival. The patients had the greatest relative risk of dying from skin melanoma during the second year from diagnosis. However, the difference in death risk due to melanoma by stage was most remarkable during the first follow-up year: the risk of patients with nonlocalized disease was over 12 times that of others. The male-female ratio in the risk of dying from skin melanoma was (to a marked extent) attributable to differences in the distributions of stage and site of the tumor. In all site groups males did worse than females but risk ratio varied from 1.15 (trunk) to 1.89 (limbs). The effect of some important prognostic factors on survival could be quantified with ample material and with a method taking into account the competing causes of death. The results suggest a difference either in biological behavior of skin melanoma or in a patient's delay between males and females.\r"

Raised CEA levels were found significantly more frequently in intrathoracically localized tumors than in cervical cancers. Patients surviving less than 6 months showed a higher rate of elevated CEA assays than those who survived 6 to 18 months.

One hundred fifteen of these 117 patients had false-positive elevations. The CA 19-9 concentration was elevated mostly in benign hepatobiliary diseases. In this group of patients, CA 19-9 was correlated to alkaline phosphatase values. Eleven patients showed an elevated CA 19-9 level for 10 months without any malignancy developing. One patient had a normal CA 19-9 concentration 8 months before clinical signs of pancreatic carcinoma developed.

The mice were killed at 1 to 6 weeks after tumor transplantation; the sixth group was killed 1 week after excision of SCC grafts. Plasma samples were obtained from each mouse at the time of death for the determination of SCC-associated antigen (SCCAA), a cytoskeletal protein fraction of about 48,000 daltons originally derived from SCC of the uterine cervix. The plasma SCCAA level rose gradually and proportionately to the growth of SCC xenografts from a baseline of 0.66 ng/ml [standard error (SE) + 0.12] to the preoperative peak of 8.44 ng/ml (SE + 1.86) at 5 weeks, to fall precipitously to the postoperative level of 1.05 ng/ml (SE + 0.27) at 6 weeks. No rise in plasma SCCAA level was observed in mice bearing a human malignant melanoma, and only modest rises were observed in mice bearing human adenocarcinomas and oat cell carcinoma. In this experimental model rising plasma SCCAA levels were found to be dependable indicators of SCC tumor growth. These observations and preliminary data on SCCAA levels in patients with or without SCC of the head and neck lend support to the clinical usefulness of serial plasma SCCAA determinations in monitoring patients with SCC of the oral cavity.\r"

This was followed by full-course radiation therapy for unresectable patients or surgery and postoperative radiation therapy for those with resectable disease. Sixteen patients had bulky unresectable disease, and ten were candidates for curative resection at study entry. Of 26 patients evaluable for response to chemotherapy, there were seven complete responses (CR) (five of six pathologically confirmed) and ten partial responses (PR) (65% CR + PR). Toxicity was generally mild with Grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting occurring in 15% and diarrhea in 12%. Nineteen percent of the patients developed transient nephrotoxicity (serum creatinine greater than 2), 62% anemia (hemoglobin decrease greater than 2 g/dl), 23% leukopenia (leukocyte count less than 3500 cells/microliters) and 8% thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50,000 cells/microliters). Anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss occurred in nearly all patients. The median survival time of all patients was 17.5 months; complete responders, 43 months; partial responders, 16 months; and nonresponders, 9 months (P = 0.0025). In a multivariate analysis of stage, primary site, resectability status, response to chemotherapy, and local treatment (surgery plus radiation versus radiation), complete response was the only statistically significant covariate for survival. In Phase II single agent trials, mitoguazone has been shown to have a 15% response rate in head and neck cancer and cisplatin, a 30% to 40% response rate (less than 10% CR). Thus, our results, both complete and overall response rates, were higher than would be expected from either drug alone. A possible mechanism for this high response rate may be mitoguazone-induced cell synchronization. In vitro studies demonstrate the accumulation of tumor cells exposed to mitoguazone in S- and G2-phases of the cell cycle. These results would support further evaluation of mitoguazone in combination to explore the theoretical potentiation of antitumor effects by sequencing with cycle-specific agents.\r"

This Phase I study established the optimal dose rate for the individual components of the admixture and demonstrated that CDDP decreases the maximum tolerated dose rate for 5FUDR. The optimal dose rate for 5FUDR is 0.075 mg/Kg/d, and for CDDP the optimal dose rate is 7.5 mg/M2/d. Dose rate limiting toxicity is an enteritis which is radiographically similar to regional enteritis and is related to the 5FUDR. An ancillary finding was a significant decrease in serum magnesium levels in 11 of 13 monitored courses presumably related to the platinum.\r"

The most durable visceral responses were partial regressions (lung, 11 months; and central nervous system, 34 months). Eleven of the 13 responders showed tumor regression within 3 months of commencing therapy, and the median response duration was 7 months (range 2-34 months). The median survival among all 34 patients was 15 months, and was 18 months among the 13 responders. Hence, a response to treatment did not necessarily confer any long-term survival advantage. Although gastrointestinal toxicities were troublesome with the earlier regimens, contemporary antiemetics (dexamethasone, metoclopramide) have substantially modified these sequelae. Platinum programs may provide useful palliation for selected patients with these neoplasms, but the impact on survival is negligible.\r"

The sex incidence, age of the patient at time of diagnosis, and location of the PRS correlated only with the clinical characteristics of the initial treated condition. The latency period (mean 10 years) showed an indefinite relationship to patient survival but no definite relationship to the patient's age at the time of the initial radiation. There was no difference between patients treated with megavoltage radiation (39 patients) and with orthovoltage radiation (seven patients) in the type of sarcoma, location, or survival, although the orthovoltage group received a lower mean radiation dose (3880 rads) than the megavoltage group (4446 rads). Megavoltage radiation, however, produced deeper tissue radiation changes and was associated with a shorter latency period. Most PRS were poorly differentiated, produced abundant collagen, and had a dismal prognosis.\r"

The results showed that (1) in normal thyroid glands, the lectin, UEA-I, is able to discriminate between follicular cells and C-cells; (2) pathologic follicular epithelium had an increased expression of UEA-I, SBA, and WGA receptors; (3) no lectin or group of lectins allow a distinction between follicular carcinoma and papillary carcinoma; (4) when benign and malignant tumors are compared for UEA-I affinity there is a significantly greater frequency of malignant tumour with UEA-I receptor; and (5) although all investigated lectins have shown receptors in endothelial cells at least in one case, the most constant findings have been obtained with UEA-I and WGA. These findings suggest that lectins are not useful in routine diagnostic pathologic examination; however, in particular cases of follicular carcinoma, UEA-I may be a useful tool for the recognition of small vessels invaded by tumoral cells and the demonstration of fucose residues in malignant tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer of the large bowel is relatively rare in persons younger than 50 years of age, but its incidence increases sharply in persons older than 60 years of age. We thought that the evaluation of colonic cell proliferation, an accurate biomarker of predisposition to colorectal cancer, might help to elucidate the susceptibility of elderly persons to this common malignancy. Accordingly, 30 persons with normal lower endoscopy results were divided into three age groups (30 to 50,51 to 65, and 66 to 90 years of age; Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Samples of rectal mucosa were taken at endoscopic examination, incubated with [3H]thymidine, and processed with standard autoradiographic techniques. At histologic examination, each intestinal hemicrypt was divided into five equal longitudinal compartments from the fundus (compartment 1) to the surface (compartment 5). The number and the position of labeled cells along the crypt were recorded. The total labeling index (LI) (the ratio of labeled cells to total cells) was significantly higher in Group 3 than in the two other groups. Similarly, the LI per crypt compartment in the most superficial portions of the crypts was consistently higher in persons older than 65 years of age (P less than 0.01 at least), indicating an expansion of the proliferative zone to the most superficial portion of the colonic glands. When the proliferative profiles of the three groups of subjects investigated were compared with those of patients with polyps, an almost complete overlap of values was observed between this population at increased risk for cancer and the subjects in Group 3. We conclude that aging is characterized by an overall increase of epithelial cell proliferation in colorectal mucosa and by an upwards expansion of the proliferative compartment, similar to that observed in a population at risk for cancer of the large bowel.\r"

  ".U": "89028132\r", 
  ".W": "In 349 patients with pure seminoma the authors determined human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) plus the free beta-subunit (HCG-beta) by a polyclonal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and found elevated serum levels in 42 patients (12%). In addition, each HCG and HCG-beta were specifically measured by monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (IRMA) in 19 of these patients. Overall 12 patients were HCG-beta positive and 12 HCG positive. Elevated serum levels of both molecules were found in five patients, whereas seven patients showed elevation only in HCG and another seven patients only in HCG-beta. In serum samples of patients with high HCG-beta and minimally elevated HCG levels the free beta-subunit could be detected by gel filtration and immunoradiometric assays, whereas both HCG-beta and holo-HCG were found in ultrafiltered and concentrated urinary samples. The authors conclude that HCG-beta can be present as the major form in serum even if both HCG-beta and HCG are detectable in urine. When measuring hormone concentration as a tumor marker in seminoma patients, methods which determine both activities, HCG plus HCG-beta, seem to be the most reliable. Whereas 16 patients with Stage I-IIc had HCG-beta levels between 0.1 and 2.8 IU/l and currently have no evidence of disease, two patients with Stage IV had HCG-beta levels of 18 and 37 IU/l and died. Current investigations have to clarify the prognostic significance of beta-subunit secretion.\r"

Breast specimens received in Surgical Pathology between December 1985 and February 1987 were aspirated, and the cells stained with propidium iodide for flow cytometric DNA analysis. A total of 344 specimens were aspirated, of which 204 (59%) were malignant and 140 (41%) benign. One hundred fifty-three malignant and 111 benign specimens contained sufficient cells for analysis. Cytologic smears were available for 177 malignant and 123 benign specimens. DNA histograms were considered diagnostic of malignancy if an aneuploid peak was present which contained at least 20% of the cells in the distribution, and had a DNA index greater than or equal to 1.2. Using these criteria, 73 of 153 (48%) carcinomas could be identified. None of the benign lesions satisfied these criteria. One fibroadenoma with atypical hyperplasia produced a distinct peak which contained less than 5% of the cells in the histogram, and had a DNA index of 1.25. Flow cytometric analysis provides objective data that complement the subjective cytologic interpretation of fine needle aspirates.\r"

Smoking habits were recorded by trained interviewers using a questionnaire. In men, a fairly consistent reduction in risk with years of cessation for each category of cigarettes per day before giving up smoking was found. In women, however, a much less consistent pattern was observed. Analysis of the data by histologic type of lung cancer showed that among women, as among men, risk was less and declined more consistently in those with Kreyberg I cancers than in those with Kreyberg II tumors. The inconsistency was seen mainly in patients with Kreyberg II cancers, which were more common among women.\r"

The left nephrectomy specimen demonstrated multiple, fungating, papillary tumors. The largest tumor measured 10 X 9 X 6 cm and invaded the renal parenchyma. Smaller tumors with long stalks were found. Microscopically, the papillary fronds of each neoplasm were lined by a single layer of cuboidal to low columnar epithelium admixed with a few areas of invasive tubular adenocarcinoma. The adjacent pelvic mucosa was the site of cuboidal epithelial metaplasia. The ultrastructure of both the papillary tumor and the pelvic mucosa suggested that they originated from the nonmucigenic metaplastic epithelium with a partial similarity to the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule. The growth pattern and the multicentric development of this unusual neoplasm suggest that this is a case of the malignant counterpart of the nephrogenic adenoma in the kidney and ureter, and reflect a biologic behavior corresponding to ordinary urothelial papillary tumors.\r"

The typical plasma cell neoplasms accounted for only one third of the cases, multiple myeloma (MM) and systemic amyloidosis (AL) being diagnosed in 18% and 15% of the patients, respectively. Eighteen (27%) of the patients were recognized as having malignant nonHodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), 21 (32%) had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 2 (3%) had hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Three patients (5%) without apparent evidence of any malignant immunoproliferative disease were classified as having a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The greatest urinary concentrations of BJP were found in plasmacytic neoplasms, the daily excretion of MM patients being significantly higher than that of AL patients. Considerably lower BJP outputs were recorded in the other diseases, the lowest ones being associated with MGUS. NHL patients had a daily excretion four times higher as compared with that of CLL patients. The distribution of NHL by histologic type was: follicular center cell lymphomas (FCCL) 39%, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 33%, immunoblastic lymphoma (IBL) 17%, and plasmacytoid lymphocytic lymphoma (PLL) 11%. The highest BJP levels were found in PLL, and the lowest ones in FCCL. In CLL patients the amount of urinary BJP correlated significantly with the tumor load, as estimated by the number of enlarged lymphoid areas. The study suggests that detection and measurement of isolated urinary BJP may provide useful data for the clinical evaluation of a wide spectrum of immunoproliferative disorders.\r"

The patients with a high mast cell count showed a significantly better 5-year survival rate than those with a low count (85.9% versus 30.5%; P less than 0.01). Five patients with distant metastases at first admission all belonged to the low count group.

  ".W": "Splenectomy has been used as initial therapy in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) for many years and usually causes rapid improvement in peripheral blood counts. However, most patients eventually require further therapy. We have analyzed the case histories of 194 patients with HCL who had splenectomy as initial therapy. The median time to failure (second therapy or death) was 18.8 months. Univariate analysis of prognostic variables demonstrated that age, hemoglobin level, platelet count, bone marrow cellularity, bone marrow hairy cells, and hairy cell index (HCI) were statistically significant predictors of failure-free survival (FFS). However, only the bone marrow cellularity and platelet count were significant independent prognostic variables by Cox analysis. The patients were divided into the following three subsets by prognosis after splenectomy: (1) low risk of failure (cellularity less than 85% and platelet count greater than or equal to 60,000/microliters), (2) intermediate risk (cellularity less than 85% and platelet count less than 60,000/microliters), and (3) high risk (cellularity greater than or equal to 85%). The median FFS for each of these subsets was 56.5 months, 11.7 months, and 5.4 months, respectively. The median overall survival after splenectomy has not been reached with follow-up of up to 22 years. Patients diagnosed since 1982 have a better overall prognosis than those diagnosed earlier, with 4-year survivals of 88% and 68%, respectively (P less than 0.01). We conclude that splenectomy should continue to be the standard initial therapy in HCL. However, patients with bone marrow cellularity of 85% or greater have a short duration of response to splenectomy, and thus, may be considered for initial systemic therapy.\r"

After careful alpha and beta adrenergic blockade in 32 patients, no complications occurred during or after tumor resection. When this procedure was ignored even in patients who had normal blood pressure before surgery, severe cardiovascular complications occurred and two patients died. In familial pheochromocytoma, bilateral adrenalectomy with preservation of normal adrenal cortical tissue when possible may be the method of choice, but careful follow-up is warranted.\r"

To investigate this issue, the US incidence of this rare lymphoma was assessed using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program (1973 through 1984). Never-married men, a relatively high risk group for AIDS, were excluded from the analyses. Brain lymphoma incidence increased from 2.7 in 1973 through 1975 to 7.5 cases per ten million population in 1982 through 1984 (chi-square trend, 15.25; P less than 0.001), and it increased among both men (chi-square trend, 6.74; P = 0.009) and women (chi-square trend, 10.48; P = 0.001). Increases in incidence also were observed among persons younger than 60 years of age (chi-square trend, 4.10; P = 0.04) and persons 60 years of age and older (chi-square trend, 9.16; P = 0.002). This increased incidence of brain lymphoma appears to be real: It antedates the AIDS epidemic and does not appear to be related to organ transplantation, another cause of increased risk of brain lymphoma. Although part of the increase may be an artifact of improvements in diagnostic technology and practice, most of the observed increase antedates the widespread use of such technologies. Finally, the increase in incidence of brain lymphoma does not appear to be related to overall trends in the incidence of brain tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it is not related to time trends in nosology.\r"

A catheter with a 90-degree primary curve was used when the proximal RCA had horizontal or inferior orientation. When the proximal segment of the RCA was oriented superiorly (shepherd's crook), the catheter with a 75-degree primary curve was used. Catheters were fabricated with short (1.5 cm) or long (2.3 cm) (USCI, C.R. Bard, Inc., Billerica, MA) distal tips. Short-tip catheters were satisfactory in the majority of cases. When the RCA had a complex course and more backup was necessary or when the ascending aorta was wide, long-tip catheters were found to be the best choice. Angioplasty of 49 lesions was attempted in 42 consecutive patients. In 39 patients successful dilatation was achieved (93%). In three patients the procedure was unsuccessful. In one patient, the lesion could not be crossed with the guidewire despite an excellent backup. In another patient, two of three stenoses were dilated successfully; the distal lesion was crossed with a guidewire but could not be crossed with the balloon catheter in spite of a good backup. The lack of a satisfactory engagement and inadequate backup were responsible for the failure in only one patient. There were no complications related to these guiding catheters. We conclude that double loop guiding catheters are safe and can be the primary choice in all right coronary angioplasties. These catheters provide an excellent backup with consequent high success rate.\r"

We measured with a Doppler tip balloon catheter, in 12 patients before and/or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty the hyperemic response following 12.5 mg intracoronary papaverine and following gradually incremental bolus injections of intracoronary adenosine, starting from 0.05 mg until a maximal hyperemic response or side effects. The mean dose (+/- SD) of adenosine needed to produce maximal hyperemia was 0.23 (+/- 0.20 mg). Coronary blood flow velocity after adenosine increased to 1.6 +/- 0.3 times resting coronary blood flow velocity, comparable in magnitude to the hyperemia following intracoronary papaverine. The time from injection to peak effect after adenosine was 7.4 (SD +/- 2.2) sec and after papaverine 26 (SD +/- 7) sec. Adenosine resulted in a bradyarrhythmia in three patients. Intracoronary adenosine is a potent and very short acting vasodilator for studying coronary flow reserve, but the side effects and unpredictability of the dosage needed to produce maximal hyperemia may limit its applicability.\r"

The first group was treated with 19 mm balloon percutaneous transluminal valvuloplasty, where the balloon diameter was always smaller than the aortic anulus diameter. Peak-to-peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 76 +/- 32 mmHg to 30 +/- 19 (P less than .05), and the aortic valve area, calculated by Gorlin formula, increased from 0.40 +/- 0.17 cm2 to 0.57 +/- 0.17 (P less than .05). The second group was treated with a trefoil 25 mm balloon, always larger than the aortic anulus diameter. In this second group, peak-to-peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 73 +/- 34 mmHg to 23 +/- 15 (P less than .05), and aortic valve area increased from 0.47 +/- 0.14 cm2 to 0.88 +/- 0.36 (P less than .05), increasing thus more than in group I (P less than .05). Clinical tolerance to balloon inflation was not the same according to individual patients but was similar between the two groups; complications were comparable in the two groups. These results suggest that aortic valvuloplasty by trefoil balloon larger than aortic anulus can provide wider aortic valve area without increasing complication rate.\r"

During cardiac catheterization and angiography, blood is sampled and contrast media, fluid, and heparin are administered. To determine the effects of these perturbations on the blood cell count and coagulation, femoral vein samples were obtained at the beginning of cardiac catheterization, before heparin, 4,000 U; at the end, before protamine reversal; and after protamine, 40 mg, was administered. At the end of catheterization, 41 +/- 3 min after heparin administration, all cellular constituents were significantly lower than control: White (W) blood cells (BC) were 8.1 +/- 2.7% lower (P less than 0.05), red (R) BC, 10 +/- 1.8% (P less than 0.05), and platelets (P) 10.9 +/- 1.5% (P less than 0.05). Protamine lowered further WBC by 23 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05 and P) by 14 +/- 2% (P less than 0.05), but did not change RBC (4.13 +/- 0.20 x 10(6) to 4.25 +/- 0.23 x 10(6]. Before protamine administration, all patients had a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 1.5 times the control value and ten of 13 patients had a value greater than 100 sec. Although four of 13 patients had an incomplete reversal of PTT after protamine, none suffered an untoward event. In conclusion, cardiac catheterization produces changes in the cellular composition of the blood, and such changes might influence hemodynamic measurements.\r"

This method outlines the parietal percardium. The curved sheath directs the bioptome to the left or right wall. Eighteen consecutive patients had an average of eight pieces of pericardium removed. On histological examination, three patients had malignancy. Six had tuberculous granuloma, and mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from all six tissue specimens but only once from the fluid. Tissue smears showed acid fast bacilli in four out of six, whereas the fluid was negative in all. The biopsy yielded diagnostic information in nine out of ten patients with a thickened pericardium.

One hundred and fifty patients with a total LAD occlusion were selected from 639 consecutive patients who had diagnostic coronary angiography during an 18-month period; the ICA was found in 45 patients. Among these patients, 30 showed the ICA as a collateral vessel supplying the distal LAD. In nine of these patients, conventional left and right coronary angiography did not reveal any other significant collateral vessels, and the distal LAD was perfused mainly by the collaterals from the ICA. No serious complications such as ventricular fibrillation or myocardial infarction occurred during these procedures. These results indicate that the selective ICA visualization is clinically important when conventional left and right angiography does not demonstrate collaterals to the obstructed LAD.\r"

  ".W": "To study the cardiac effects of progressive hypoxemia, we measured the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR), myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and myocardial oxygen delivery (MQO2) in eight thoracotomized dogs anesthetized with fentanyl and droperidol. We specifically looked for evidence of oxygen supply limitation of MVO2 and depressed contractility (altered ESPVR) during stepwise decreases in inspired oxygen fraction. We hypothesized that the reported relation between MVO2 and left ventricular pressure-volume area (PVA) may hold when inadequate MQO2 determines MVO2, which then may limit PVA, manifested partly as a change in the ESPVR. Initially, as arterial oxygen saturation was decreased from 95 +/- 3% to 64 +/- 14%, coronary blood flow increased so that MQO2 was maintained with no change in myocardial extraction ratio (ERm = MVO2/MQO2). During this first phase, lactate utilization, PVA, and ESPVR did not change. When oxygen saturation was further reduced, coronary blood flow rose no higher and ERm increased, but not enough to maintain MVO2. Lactate consumption decreased and ST segments rose, signaling a change from aerobic metabolism. MVO2 decrease was associated with a fall in PVA, which was due to a fall in blood pressure and a significant depression of the ESPVR. Specifically, the volume intercept of the ESPVR increased in all dogs (6.5-20.1 ml, p less than 0.0001), accounting for two thirds of the increase in end-systolic volume. The slope of the ESPVR decreased during hypoxia (13.3-6.1 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.02), accounting for only one third of the observed increase in end-systolic volume. We believe that the evidence of anaerobic metabolism, the decrease in PVA, and the depression of the ESPVR demonstrates onset of oxygen supply limitation of MVO2. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that limited MVO2 may limit PVA. The hypoxic volume intercept alteration of the ESPVR is different from changes in the slope of ESPVR seen with other interventions. This may be analogous to recent observations in isolated muscle that show hypoxic depression in contractility to be different from other interventions.\r"

Lidocaine (43-200 microM) reduced sodium current during repetitive depolarizing pulses in a use-dependent manner. To clarify the nature of the use-dependent block, we characterized the time course of block development using a two-pulse protocol. Two distinct phases of block development were found: a rapid phase (tau = 1-6 msec) having a time course concurrent with the time course of channel activation, and a slower phase (tau = 100-900 msec), which developed after channels inactivated. The amplitude of the block during the rapid phase of development was a steep function of transmembrane voltage over the range of -70 to +20 mV. The voltage-dependence was similar to that for sodium channel activation (sodium conductance) but was too steep to be attributed solely to the passive movement of a singly charged molecule under the influence of the transmembrane voltage gradient. These results suggest that use-dependent block of sodium channels in cardiac tissue may result from an interaction of lidocaine with sodium channels in the activated as well as the inactivated channel states. Possible mechanisms underlying the fast component of block are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed on canine superfused ventricular epicardial tissue slices to determine the effects of 1.0-2.0 mM heptanol, an uncoupling agent, on conduction longitudinal and transverse to myocardial fiber orientation. Conduction velocities were measured between proximal and distal pairs of epicardial electrodes oriented transverse and longitudinal to the direction of a conducted wavefront evoked by pacing at a basic cycle length of 2,000 msec from one margin of the tissue before and after the addition of heptanol. In a separate group of tissues, the dual bipolar orthogonal electrode was used to sequentially map epicardial activation at 40 to 45 sites in a 1 cm x 2 cm area before and 30 minutes after the introduction of heptanol. In a third group of tissues, transmembrane potentials were recorded with standard microelectrode techniques to determine the effects of heptanol on action potential characteristics. Heptanol did not significantly effect action potential amplitude or maximum rate of depolarization. After 1.0 mM heptanol, conduction velocity began to decrease in 1-2 minutes and reached a steady state in 15-20 minutes. Conduction velocity in the longitudinal direction decreased from a control value of 0.56 +/- 0.13 to 0.46 +/- 0.10 M/sec (+/- SD) at 30 minutes after heptanol (p = 0.005). In the transverse direction, it decreased from 0.24 +/- 0.09 to 0.17 +/- 0.05 M/sec (p = 0.002). The ratio of longitudinal to transverse conduction velocities increased from 2.54 +/- 1.00 to 2.94 +/- 0.82 (p = 0.042). Thus, heptanol preferentially slowed conduction in the transverse direction. Because heptanol did not greatly influence active membrane properties, we used cable equations to calculate the time course of the change in effective junctional resistivity, which rose from 133.2 omega.cm before heptanol to 312.2 omega.cm 30 minutes after heptanol administration. We conclude that heptanol slows conduction velocity by selectively increasing junctional resistivity. The preferential slowing of conduction in the transverse direction is most likely due to the fact that more junctional resistances are encountered per unit distance in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction.\r"

In intact muscles exposed to 128 mM K+, the Vmax reached a maximum before the peak of the phasic component of contraction and reduced proportionally with changes in the amplitude of the subsequent tonic contraction. TPA (0.1 microM) enhanced to a greater extent the amplitude of the tonic than the phasic contraction. During the tonic phase, TPA enhanced the Vmax and amplitude of the contraction more than the phosphorylation of MLC20. In skinned muscles, Ca2+ (0.3-1.0 microM) increased the force, Vmax and MLC20 phosphorylation, in a dose dependent manner. The relation between any two of the above three parameters was always linear. TPA (0.1 microM) with phosphatidylserine (50 micrograms/ml) time-dependently increased the force and Vmax observed with 0.3-0.5 microM Ca2+. The relation between the force and Vmax shifted in the direction of that observed in the presence of high Ca2+, but in 0.5 microM Ca2+, TPA with phosphatidylserine showed little change in the phosphorylation of MLC20. As estimated from the actions of TPA, protein kinase C may contribute to activation of contractile proteins through MLC20 phosphorylation dependent and other regulatory processes.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of the newer inotropic drugs, pimobendan (UD-CG 115 BS) and milrinone (Win 47203), on the electrical, mechanical and biochemical activity of intact and detergent-skinned preparations of cardiac muscle. Both of these agents increased contractile force of guinea pig papillary muscle preparations bathed under physiological conditions or depolarized with 25 mM K+o. The positive inotropic action was associated with potentiation of the Ca2+-dependent slow action potentials (APS). Contractile force developed in the presence of 25 mM [K]o and 1 microM isoproterenol was increased further by addition of 50 microM pimobendan with no effect on the slow action potential. Milrinone (50 microM) did not produce a further increase in the force or potentiate the slow APs. Pimobendan, in a dose-dependent manner, increased active tension developed by chemically-skinned dog heart muscle fibers at submaximally activating concentrations of Ca2+, whereas milrinone did not. At pCa 6.25, the half-maximal concentration of pimobendan for stimulation of force development was about 40 microM. At maximally activating levels of Ca2+ (pCa 4.5), pimobendan had little or no effect on force development. The effect of pimobendan on force was paralleled by changes in the Ca2+-activated Mg-ATPase activity of the isometric skinned fiber preparations. Moreover, the tension-cost (unit increase in ATPase rate/unit increase in force) was unchanged in the presence of pimobendan. Milrinone did not affect ATP hydrolysis by the skinned fiber preparations. Force-pCa and ATPase-pCa relations of skinned fiber preparations contracting isometrically were shifted to the left by 0.15-0.20 pCa units in the presence of 50 microM pimobendan. In contrast, there was no effect of pimobendan on the ATPase activity of unloaded myofibrillar preparations. The stimulation of force and ATPase activity of the skinned heart muscle fibers could be accounted for by an effect of pimobendan on the affinity of the regulatory (low affinity, Ca2+-specific) binding sites of cardiac troponin C. Ca2+ binding to the \"structural\" high affinity sites of troponin C was slightly inhibited. The results indicate that the positive inotropic actions of pimobendan, but not milrinone, may involve activation of the cardiac myofilaments by a direct effect involving an increased affinity of the regulatory site on troponin C for Ca2+.\r"

Increasing stimulation frequency from 0.5 to 3.0 Hz in the presence of O2 caused no significant change in ri. Hypoxia to a level of PO2 = 30 mm Hg caused an increase in ri that averaged 13.7% at a stimulation frequency of 0.5 Hz and 46% at 3.0 Hz. In all experiments, the increase in ri during hypoxia at 3.0 Hz was greater than the increase at 0.5 Hz, but conduction velocity did not change at either rate. These results indicate that hypoxia causes rate-dependent cellular uncoupling but, under the conditions of our experiments, does not cause significant changes in conduction.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we examined phosphoinositide metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion using an isolated and perfused rat heart. When myocardial phosphoinositides were prelabeled with [3H]inositol, reperfusion after 30 minutes of normothermic global ischemia resulted in significant accumulations of radiolabeled inositol phosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate. Isotopic incorporation of [3H]inositol into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate was increased significantly in the heart reperfused with [3H]inositol after 30 minutes of ischemia compared with that perfused with [3H]inositol after 30 minutes of nonischemic perfusion. However, isotopic incorporation of [3H]glycerol into diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and all of the three phosphoinositides was diminished in the reperfused hearts. Reperfusion of the ischemic heart prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid resulted in significant increases in [14C]diacylglycerol and [14C]phosphatidic acid. The enhanced accumulations of [3H]inositol phosphates during reperfusion were not affected by treatment with prazosin plus atropine or indomethacin, but were inhibited by hypoxic reperfusion, reperfusion with Ca2+-free buffer, or by mepacrine. These results suggest that myocardial reperfusion stimulates phosphodiesteratic breakdown and turnover of phosphoinositides, and increased Ca2+ influx caused by reperfusion may be involved in the mechanism of stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity in the rat heart.\r"

To investigate the role of the sympathoadrenergic system in this arteriolar wall thickening, we partially constricted or sham-constricted the abdominal aorta in adrenal-demedullated, 6-week-old rats that had had guanethidine injections to produce peripheral sympathectomy (S rats, n = 17 coarcted, 16 sham-coarcted) and in sham-demedullated, sham-sympathectomized control rats (SS rats, n = 13 coarcted, 15 sham-coarcted). In both SS and S rats with coarctation, tail and femoral arterial and conscious abdominal aortic pressures were not increased but carotid pressures rose by greater than 30% (p less than 0.01), accompanied by 46-75% increases in cardiac ventricular weight/body weight. In coarcted rats, 4-6 weeks after aortic constriction, compared with sham-coarcted rats, whether S or SS, observation of the cremaster microcirculation revealed increased wall area, wall thickness, and W/L of third- to fifth-order arterioles, both in the resting state and after maximal relaxation with topical nitroprusside. For example, in coarcted S rats wall area after nitroprusside was elevated by 24%, 39%, and 37% in third-, fourth-, and fifth-order arterioles (p less than 0.01). These findings indicate that arteriolar wall thickening in hypertension may occur independently of intra-arterial pressure or sympathoadrenergic influences. Humoral growth factors may be involved.\r"

  ".U": "89028998\r", 
  ".W": "Disagreement regarding the cardioprotective role of superoxide dismutase may relate to the use of different durations for induction of ischemic injury and reperfusion. The present study employed superoxide dismutase conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG-SOD), which has a half-life greater than 30 hours. Two protocols differing in the mode of administration and the duration of the reperfusion interval were used. Dogs were subjected to occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery for 90 minutes, then reperfused for 6 hours (Protocol A) or 4 days (Protocol B). The dogs received either polyethylene glycol conjugated to albumin (PEG-ALB) or PEG-SOD (1,000 U/kg). In Protocol A, treatment was administered starting 15 minutes before coronary occlusion and continued for 2 hours, terminating 15 minutes after reperfusion. Infarct size was determined 6 hours later. In Protocol B, the conjugated proteins were given 15 minutes before reperfusion and ended simultaneously with reperfusion. Infarct size was measured after 4 days. Infarct size (percentage of area at risk) in control (n = 9) and treated (n = 9) dogs in Protocol A differed between groups: 46.7 +/- 3.5% versus 28.3 +/- 2.9%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.005); risk regions did not differ: 42.8 +/- 1.5% versus 43.8 +/- 2.1%, respectively. Myocardial salvage also was observed in Protocol B. Infarct size in control (n = 13) and treated (n = 13) groups was 44.2 +/- 2.6% versus 29.2 +/- 1.6%, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.005), with risk regions being 44.4 +/- 1.4% versus 46.0 +/- 1.6% (p = NS). Hemodynamic variables did not differ during the period of coronary artery occlusion. The respective collateral blood flows to the inner two thirds of the ischemic myocardium determined 60 minutes after occlusion were 0.05 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g and 0.06 +/- 0.04 ml/min/g (p = 0.806) for the PEG-ALB and PEG-SOD treated groups, respectively. Infarct size was related inversely to collateral blood flow in the PEG-ALB treated group. This relation shifted downward (analysis of covariance, p = 0.017). Plasma SOD activity in Protocols A sustained for 6 hours. Significant enzymatic activity was present after 4 days in Protocol B. Previous negative studies with native SOD may be related to the short half-life of its free-radical scavenging capacity, which compromises the chances of observing a protective effect after 4 days of reperfusion. The present results support our previous observations, as well as those of other investigators, demonstrating that superoxide dismutase can reduce that component of myocardial injury associated with reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Microscopic, myofilament motion caused by spontaneous oscillatory Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of unstimulated rat papillary muscles produces scattered light intensity fluctuations (SLIF) in a laser beam scattered by the tissue. SLIF frequency increases with Ca2+ loading of resting muscle. We used novel time-gated SLIF measurements to determine how electrical stimulation (which per se both induces SR Ca2+ release and modulates total cellular Ca2+ loading) affects SLIF. Stimulation of thin rat, right ventricular muscles at 1 Hz in bathing [Ca2+] (Ca0) of 1.5 mM at 29 degrees C abolished SLIF for 5-7 seconds; SLIF then reappeared and monotonically increased for 10-15 seconds to reach the steady resting level. Resting force transients paralleled those of SLIF. The magnitude of depression and time course of recovery of both resting force and SLIF at this Ca0 vary inversely with the rate of prior stimulation and the number of stimuli given. An increase in Ca0 or disablement of the Na-K pump increased both resting SLIF and force; transient stimulation under these conditions (i.e., in a 2.5-5.5-second \"diastolic window\" after cessation of stimulation) augmented SLIF and force above the resting level. Isoproterenol caused a modest reduction of resting SLIF, but it transiently increased SLIF after stimulation up to 10-fold above the resting level. Nifedipine did not affect resting SLIF but transiently depressed SLIF after stimulation. Ryanodine abolished SLIF both after stimulation and at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89029000\r", 
  ".W": "Scattered light intensity fluctuations (SLIF) (which monitor spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR]) and resting and twitch tension were measured during intervals after stimulation in rat and rabbit papillary muscles. For 1 to 5 seconds after stimulation of rat muscle bathed in 1.5 mM [Ca2+] (Cao), twitch and resting tension are depressed and SLIF are transiently abolished. SLIF and resting tension then recover simultaneously and monotonically but lag behind the restitution of twitch tension. In the absence of further stimulation, SLIF persist and the rested state twitch amplitude remains potentiated. When Cao is increased above 2.5 mM, the restitution of all parameters following stimulation is accelerated and becomes oscillatory; the lag of SLIF and resting tension restitution behind that of the twitch increases such that twitch amplitude increases, overshoots, and decreases to a nadir as SLIF and resting tension reach their initial maximum. In a given muscle, the maximum twitch amplitude occurs at approximately the same level of SLIF; when this level is exceeded, either transiently during monotonic or oscillatory recovery after stimulation in a given Cao or in the steady rested state by an increase in Cao, twitch tension decreases. Ryanodine (1 microM), caffeine (10 mM), or replacement of Cao with strontium abolishes SLIF and causes twitch amplitude to decay with rest. In contrast to rat, twitch amplitude in rabbit muscle bathed in physiological Cao decays with rest and SLIF are nonmeasurable at any interval following stimulation. When Cao is increased to 20 mM during rest, SLIF occur and the rest decay of the twitch is abolished. We interpret the parallel behavior of SLIF and rest potentiation to indicate that in the presence of SLIF, the average SR Ca2+ load within the tissue is high. Depolarization of a tissue exhibiting SLIF causes a large twitch but also a transient depletion of the average SR Ca2+ load. That the restitution of SLIF lags behind recovery of twitch amplitude suggests that the onset of spontaneous SR Ca2+ release requires a delay following SR Ca2+ replenishment. The simultaneous occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ release in a sufficient number of cells places an upper limit on twitch amplitude either during recovery following stimulation or at rest.\r"

To determine the relation between serial changes in ventricular dilatation and changes in ejection fraction, we studied 61 patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation by echocardiography and radionuclide angiography before, 6-8 months after, and 3-7 years after aortic valve replacement. Between preoperative and early postoperative studies, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension decreased (from 75 +/- 6 to 56 +/- 9 mm, p less than 0.001), peak systolic wall stress decreased (from 247 +/- 50 to 163 +/- 42 dynes x 10(3)/cm2), and ejection fraction increased (from 43 +/- 9% to 51 +/- 16%, p less than 0.001). Between early and late postoperative studies, diastolic dimension and peak systolic wall stress did not change, but ejection fraction increased further (to 56 +/- 19%, p less than 0.001). The increase in ejection fraction correlated with magnitude of reduction in diastolic dimension between preoperative and early postoperative studies (r = 0.63), between early and late postoperative studies (r = 0.54), and between preoperative and late postoperative studies (r = 0.69). Late increases in ejection fraction usually represented the continuation of an initial increase occurring early after operation. Thus, short-term and long-term improvement in left ventricular systolic function after operation is related significantly to the early reduction in left ventricular dilatation arising from correction of left ventricular volume overload. Moreover, late improvement in ejection fraction occurs commonly in patients with an early increase in ejection fraction after valve replacement but is unlikely to occur in patients with no change in ejection fraction during the first 6 months after operation.\r"

We report our initial experience with the emergency implantation of endoluminal stents for acute vessel closure after coronary balloon angioplasty. Nine patients received one stent, and two patients received two stents during the study period. Implantation was technically successful in all patients; there were no deaths, no myocardial infarctions as evidenced by Q wave on the electrocardiogram, and no need for emergency surgery. One additional patient, not satisfying the study inclusion criteria, died 16 hours after stent implantation from left ventricular failure and intractable arrythmias. Two patients in the study group had a moderate creatinine phosphokinase rise during the first 48 hours after implantation. During a median follow-up period of 3 months (range, 1-20 months), there have been no deaths and no need for elective coronary bypass surgery. One patient required emergency recanalization 3 months after implantation because of acute occlusion of the stented segment with limited myocardial infarction. Six patients have undergone control angiography, and none has developed chronic restenosis within the stented segment. For selected patients, coronary artery stenting appears to be a promising alternative to emergency bypass surgery after acute vessel occlusion during balloon angioplasty.\r"

Each lesion was dilated three times with the autoperfusion inflation bracketed between two inflations by standard angioplasty catheters. Chest pain score, 12-lead electrocardiogram, heart rate, and mean aortic pressure were recorded before each inflation and at 1-minute intervals after inflation.

The maximum ST-segment elevation and depression in any lead during autoperfusion angioplasty (0.3 +/- 0.5 and 0.6 +/- 0.8 mm) was significantly less than for the pre- (2.4 +/- 1.7 mm, p = 0.002 and 2.2 +/- 1.3 mm, p = 0.0004) or post- (1.9 +/- 1.3 mm, p = 0.002 and 1.6 +/- 1.3 mm, p = 0.018) standard dilatations at the same point in time. Maximal chest pain score during autoperfusion (3.2 +/- 3.5) was lower than for the pre- (6.1 +/- 2.1, p = 0.003) but not the post- (5.2 +/- 3.1, p = 0.07) standard angioplasty.

Trains of ultrarapid subthreshold stimulation were delivered with cycle lengths of 100 to 10 msec in decremental steps of 10 msec. A 5-second pause was allowed between each step (decrement). A 2-msec pulse width was used in all patients, and a 4-msec pulse width was also tested in eight patients. Any apparent captured beat was disregarded. In eight (53%) patients, ultrarapid subthreshold stimulation terminated VT, and in the remaining seven (47%) patients, it did not. The lowest subthreshold stimulation that effectively terminated VT was 0.05 mA. In 10 patients, the site of early activity during VT was determined by endocardial catheter mapping, and subthreshold stimulation more effectively terminated VT in eight patients when it was applied close to the site of early activity. In seven patients who underwent mapping-guided arrhythmia surgery, subthreshold stimulation was applied close to the site of early activity and successfully terminated VT. In no patient did subthreshold stimulation produce acceleration of VT or induce ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that defibrillation success could be predicted from a single measurement of defibrillation threshold.

Each patient was then assigned to one of five energy subgroups (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 times defibrillation threshold) for a single shock (followed by a rescue shock if necessary) for a subsequent ventricular fibrillation episode. A curve relating percent success to energy was then constructed for the group. Defibrillation threshold averaged 4.7 +/- 2.98 J for the group (mean +/- SD). There was a curvilinear relation between the energy of the defibrillation threshold ratio test shock and percent success: 33.3%, 58.3%, 81.8%, 91.7%, and 100% at mean defibrillation threshold ratios of 0.56 +/- 0.14, 1.02 +/- 0.07, 1.53 +/- 0.14, 1.88 +/- 0.09, and 2.60 +/- 0.14, respectively. We conclude that consistent defibrillation is predictable from a single measurement of defibrillation threshold. Furthermore, for an individual patient, a safety margin of 2.6 times defibrillation threshold should approximate 100% successful defibrillation for a single test shock.\r"

In the other patients, late survival and functional status were good, but survival was poorer than in the control population.

Late sudden death occurred in only three patients, between 10 and 21 years postoperatively.

Twenty-nine patients had a newly occluded coronary artery. Twenty-five of these 29 patients had at least one artery with a greater than 50% stenosis on the initial angiogram. However, in 19 of 29 (66%) patients, the artery that subsequently occluded had less than a 50% stenosis on the first angiogram, and in 28 of 29 (97%), the stenosis was less than 70%. In every patient, at least some irregularity of the coronary wall was present on the first angiogram at the site of the subsequent coronary obstruction. In only 10 of the 29 (34%) did the infarction occur due to occlusion of the artery that previously contained the most severe stenosis. Furthermore, no correlation existed between the severity of the initial coronary stenosis and the time from the first catheterization until the infarction (r2 = 0.0005, p = NS). These data suggest that assessment of the angiographic severity of coronary stenosis may be inadequate to accurately predict the time or location of a subsequent coronary occlusion that will produce a myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The clinically important coronary segmental anatomy has been described in a format useful for quantitative analysis and standardized display. We have determined the intrathoracic location and course of each of the 23 coronary artery segments and branches commonly used for clinical description of disease. Measurements were averaged from perpendicular angiographic view-pairs in 37 patients with normal-sized hearts. Each segment or branch is described by several points along its course; each point is specified in polar coordinates as the radial distance from the principal coronary ostium and by angles about the patient, corresponding to those describing rotation in c-arm radiographic systems. This computer-assisted measurement method is accurate to within +/- 0.2 cm (SD) and +/- 2 degrees in phantom studies. Coronary segment location among a group of normal-sized hearts can be specified to within +/- 1.0 cm (SD). For example, the left anterior descending coronary artery segment at the apex of the heart is 12.2 +/- 1.0 cm from the left coronary ostium, 32 +/- 4 degrees to the left of the anterioposterior axis, and at 46 +/- 7 degrees of caudal angulation. There are several clinically important applications of this new knowledge. First, this anatomic format provides the basis for estimating regional myocardial contraction and the relative size of the myocardial region at risk from a given arterial occlusion. Second, precise knowledge of \"normal\" segment location greatly simplifies the computation of dimensional correction factors for quantitative arteriography. Third, viewing angles most appropriate for videodensitometric assessment of lesion lumen area may be computed from these data. The theoretical basis and numerical values needed for most of the above estimates are provided. Finally, a computer program has been written to generate a three-dimensional tree-branch vascular model from these anatomic locations. This easily used interactive program aids in teaching coronary angiographic anatomy and, of importance, permits selection of viewing angles that \"best\" visualize the traditionally difficult parts of the coronary tree.\r"

  ".W": "The application of balloon aortic valvuloplasty to elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis and a low ventricular ejection fraction is undefined. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in a subset of 28 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 +/- 11%), severe aortic stenosis, and a mean age of 79 +/- 5 years. After valvuloplasty, significant increases were seen in aortic valve area (from 0.5 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.2 cm2), aortic systolic pressure (from 120 +/- 12 to 135 +/- 22 mm Hg), and cardiac output (from 4.2 +/- 1.1 to 4.8 +/- 1.6 l/min) (p less than 0.01), and significant decreases were seen in transaortic pressure gradient (from 69 +/- 25 to 35 +/- 15 mm Hg) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (from 24 +/- 9 to 20 +/- 7 mm Hg) (p less than 0.01). All patients had symptomatically improved at the time of discharge. Serial radionuclide ventriculography showed an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 37 +/- 11% before valvuloplasty to 44 +/- 14% within 48 hours after dilatation and to 49 +/- 13% at 3 months after dilatation. However, there was substantial heterogeneity of response. Thirteen patients (group A) showed progressive increases in left ventricular ejection fraction (from 34 +/- 11% to 49 +/- 15% to 58 +/- 11%, p less than 0.0001), whereas 15 patients (group B) showed no significant change in ejection fraction (from 41 +/- 10% to 40 +/- 13% to 41 +/- 10%, p = NS) over 3 months. There was no difference between these groups with respect to age, extent of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, and aortic valve area before and after valvuloplasty. However, peak systolic wall stress and left ventricular dimensions were higher in group B compared with group A. In conclusion, balloon aortic valvuloplasty may result in symptomatic improvement in patients with aortic stenosis and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction; some patients develop progressive increases in ejection fraction, whereas others fail to show improvement.\r"

In this study, we used MIBG with tomographic imaging to evaluate noninvasively the differences in myocardial sympathetic innervation in 14 healthy volunteers and 16 patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy (CM). Initial (15-minute) images demonstrated no significant differences in MIBG concentration in the hearts of patients with CM and of healthy volunteers. However, the myocardial retention of MIBG was significantly reduced in the patients with CM. Expressed as the percent washout from 15 to 85 minutes, the patients with CM had a 28 +/- 12% washout rate compared with 6 +/- 8% in the controls (p less than 0.001). A small subset of patients from each group imaged at 4-hour intervals demonstrated even greater disparity in washout rates. In addition, the patients with CM had significantly greater heterogeneity in the MIBG activity distribution within the myocardial images. There was 47 +/- 15% intraimage variability in MIBG distribution in the patients with CM and 22 +/- 9% variation in the controls (p less than 0.001). We conclude from these data that the myocardial distribution and kinetics of MIBG in images obtained from patients with CM differ significantly from those of controls and that the MIBG patterns may be used as a relatively noninvasive means to evaluate the severity of altered adrenergic innervation in the hearts of these patients.\r"

In 15 normal subjects and 30 patients with coronary artery disease, 201Tl and 15-(p-123I-iodophenyl)-pentadecanoic acid (IPPA) were administered during exercise under fasting conditions and at rest. In 10 patients, the study was repeated after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty; in three patients, the study was repeated after infarction. The initial accumulation of IPPA, related to that of 201Tl (both background and crossover corrected), was used for determinations of the regional rate constant of IPPA influx into myocardial tissue (k1*). In normal subjects, no significant differences in k1* between major myocardial segments were found; the average value of k1* was 0.57 +/- 0.13/min (mean +/- SD) at rest and 0.42 +/- 0.06/min at exercise (average workload, 123 +/- 47 W). With increasing free fatty acid plasma concentration and perfusion, free fatty acid influx increased in a saturable fashion. The Michaelis-Menten constant (KM*) and the maximal velocity (Vmax*) for IPPA influx into myocardial tissue were estimated to be 470 nmol/g and 430 nmol/g.min, respectively. In ischemic areas, k1* was reduced to 57 +/- 18% of k1* value in nonaffected segments. The areas were larger than those showing reduced 201Tl uptake. Preinfarction and postinfarction studies showed that the size of 201Tl defects in postinfarction images corresponded with the size of the area with reduced k1* observed in preinfarction scintigrams. Revascularization led to an increase of 201Tl uptake and to normalization of k1*.\r"

The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was 40% lower in the lymphocytes of smoking twins compared with their nonsmoking cotwins (beta-receptor density, 6.7 +/- 1.2 and 11.1 +/- 1.8 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively; p less than 0.05). The corresponding apparent Kd values were 31.7 +/- 5.5 and 26.7 +/- 5.4 pM, respectively. Stimulation of the lymphocyte beta-receptors resulted in significantly lower levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the smokers compared with the nonsmokers (16.2 +/- 3.3 vs. 29.2 +/- 6.5 pmol/10(6) cells, p less than 0.05). When subjected to submaximal exercise, the smokers had a lower level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in plasma (25.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.0, p less than 0.05) and a net decrease was seen in plasma free fatty acids in the smokers compared with a net increase in the nonsmokers (-15% vs. +19%, p less than 0.01). The total plasma catecholamine level was, in the basal state, significantly higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers (74.8%, p less than 0.05). The intrapair difference in plasma norepinephrine predicted well the intrapair difference in beta-receptor density (r = -0.84, p less than 0.001). We conclude that the autonomic neurohumoral response evoked by cigarette smoking results in downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in long-term smokers.\r"

  ".W": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are depolarizing potentials that occur before complete repolarization. They may be important in the acquired and possibly the idiopathic long QT syndrome and associated ventricular tachycardia (VT). The purpose of these experiments was to study in 20 open-chest dogs the effects of sympathetic stimulation on EADs and VT produced with cesium chloride (84 mg/kg i.v.) alone or combined with left (LAS), right (RAS), or bilateral (BAS) ansae subclaviae stimulation (2 Hz, 4 msec, 2 mA). We compared the EAD amplitude and area as a percentage of monophasic action potential amplitude and area, respectively, recorded simultaneously with contact electrodes from right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and recorded the prevalence of VT induction during each intervention. Both LAS and BAS produced left ventricular EADs with larger amplitudes and areas than did RAS or cesium alone. BAS and LAS produced larger EADs recorded from the LV than from the RV. Cesium produced VT in six of 20 dogs, RAS in three of 20, BAS in 12 of 20, and LAS in 16 of 20. Norepinephrine (0.1-1.5 micrograms/kg/min) caused VT in all dogs by producing a dose-related increase in EAD amplitude that was similar in RV and LV, suggesting that the response of RV and LV EADs to catecholamine stimulation was not intrinsically different. During stimulation of left ansae subclaviae at increasing frequencies (1, 2, 4, and 6 Hz), EADs were significantly larger in LV than in RV at all stimulus frequencies, and the amplitude of EADs in both ventricles increased with increasing stimulus frequencies. Based on the increased LV amplitude and area of cesium chloride-induced EADs during LAS and BAS, with EAD amplitude dependent on the frequency of LAS but with an equal RV and LV EAD amplitude during norepinephrine infusion, it is possible that more norepinephrine released into the LV during LAS and BAS compared with RAS causes larger amplitude LV EADs that reach threshold to cause VT more often. Thus, quantitative differences between the effects of left and right stellate ganglia stimulation rather than qualitative differences or imbalance may account for the arrhythmogenic potential of the left stellate ganglion.\r"

To determine the effect of arginine vasopressin upon systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flows, we administered the specific inhibitor of the vascular action of vasopressin [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid),2-(O-methyl)-tyrosine]-arginine vasopressin [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP] to 15 dogs with chronic right-heart failure produced by tricuspid avulsion and progressive pulmonary artery constriction. The animals exhibited increased plasma arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine levels. Vasopressin inhibition increased cardiac output and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P, and it decreased total peripheral vascular resistance, whereas mean aortic pressure did not change significantly. Simultaneously, blood flow increased to skeletal muscle, kidneys, skin, and right and left ventricular myocardium. Plasma catecholamines also increased. Pretreatment with propranolol and prazosin abolished the increases in cardiac output and left ventricular function produced by vasopressin inhibition. Pretreatment also led to a decrease in mean aortic pressure after vasopressor inhibition. In contrast, administration of d(CH)2)5Tyr(Me)AVP to 11 sham-operated animals or administration of normal saline to nine sham-operated and eight heart-failure dogs was without effect either in the absence or in the presence of adrenergic receptor blockade. Thus, arginine vasopressin participates in the control of the circulation in right-sided congestive heart failure, with both a direct constrictor action on blood vessels and an indirect action by inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

The heart rate (HR) response (delta HR/delta SaO2) under control conditions was 0.39 +/- 1.29 beats/min/% (mean +/- SD, n = 11; values greater than 0 indicate a tachycardiac response to hypoxemia). After sulfur dioxide insufflation, all nine rabbits had a bradycardiac response (-2.02 +/- 1.13 beats/min/%), which was significantly less than control (p less than 0.0001). After bupivacaine inhalation, the heart rate response (0.27 +/- 1.04 beats/min/%) was unchanged from control. There were no significant differences in the percent increase of minute ventilation during hypoxemia in all runs. Our results indicate that in rabbits the receptors responsible for the increase in heart rate during progressive hypoxemia are the slowly adapting receptors.\r"

One pair of crystals spanned the entire ventricular wall (transmural), and the other spanned the outer half of the ventricular wall. Inner wall thickness was computed as the difference between transmural wall thickness and outer wall thickness. Dogs performed control treadmill exercise and exercise with a coronary stenosis that reduced circumflex artery flow to resting control levels. Percent systolic thickening at rest for the transmural, inner, and outer regions was 21.3 +/- 11.8%, 35.5 +/- 20.3%, and 10.3 +/- 5.0% (mean +/- SD), respectively. During exercise without stenosis, systolic thickening increased to 143 +/- 37% of control for outer wall crystals and 137 +/- 26% of control for the inner portion of the wall. During exercise, the addition of a coronary stenosis caused a reduction in thickening to 17.7 +/- 28.5% of control for the outer wall and 40.1 +/- 32.3% of control for the inner portion of the wall; these were not significantly different. In contrast, normalized inner wall blood flow during exercise with circumflex artery stenosis (25.0 +/- 16.0%) was significantly less than for the outer portion of the wall (48.5 +/- 20.9%). Further, there was a close relation between changes in inner wall thickening and inner wall blood flow (r = 0.84), whereas there was only a very weak relation between changes in outer wall blood flow and function (r = 0.62; p = 0.04). During ischemia in the exercising dog, outer wall thickening is depressed out of proportion to reductions in outer wall blood flow and is not preserved relative to inner wall thickening.\r"

Reentry occurred around a fixed path with incomplete recovery of excitability. Among 18 experiments, there was complete concordance between the occurrence of spontaneous cycle length oscillation and spontaneous terminations; both were observed in 10 experiments and neither in the other eight (p less than 0.001). Local changes in conduction during oscillations resulted from the dependence of both conduction velocity and action potential duration on the preceding local diastolic interval. Interval-dependent changes in action potential duration contributed to the oscillation by altering the next diastolic interval. Because of changes in action potential duration, changes in cycle length were poorly correlated with changes in diastolic interval and, therefore, with local conduction velocity. Complex oscillations resulted from variations in conduction time at multiple sites in the circuit. Oscillations caused most spontaneous terminations. The critical event was an exceptionally long diastolic interval preceding the next-to-last cycle that accelerated local conduction (which tended to shorten the last cycle) and prolonged action potential duration and refractoriness at the site of block. Ninety-two of 99 recordings of spontaneous termination showed evidence of oscillation of conduction and refractoriness causing block.\r"

In 15 anesthetized, closed-chest dogs, a 6F electrode catheter was inserted via the jugular vein into the coronary sinus (CS). A second catheter was inserted via the femoral artery into the left ventricle and positioned beneath the mitral valve, high against the anulus, and directly opposite the CS electrode. The LV tip electrode was positioned to record the largest LA potential to ensure proximity to the anulus. Thirty-four sites were tested (five anterior, 14 lateral, and 15 posterior). Radiofrequency current (continuous wave, 625 kHz) was delivered between the CS and LV electrodes at 37-55 V (median, 41 V) for 4-60 seconds (median, 20 seconds). Current ranged from 0.10 to 0.35 A (median, 0.18 A), resulting in power ranging from 4.3 to 19.2 W (median, 7.3 W) and total energy of 51-446 J (median, 152 J). Dogs were sacrificed 2-9 days later. The CS was grossly intact in all dogs and thrombosed in one dog. The circumflex artery was grossly normal in all dogs. Necrosis of a small segment of the arterial wall was found microscopically in one dog. Lesions were identified at 30 of the 34 sites. Twenty-two (73%) of the 30 lesions consisted of a cylindrical-shaped area of necrosis extending between the anulus and CS with diameter ranging from 2.1 to 15.0 mm (median, 4.0 mm). Atrial and ventricular epicardial necrosis extended 0-7.0 mm (median, 2.5 mm) and 0-6.8 mm (median, 2.6 mm) beyond the anulus, respectively. At the remaining eight (27%) sites, little or no epicardial injury occurred, possibly because of downward displacement of LV electrode (four sites) or positioning of LV electrode within a trabecular recess (four sites). We conclude that 1) radiofrequency current delivered between CS and LV produced, at 22 (65%) of 34 sites, LA and LV necrosis adjacent to the anulus without rupture of the CS and that 2) large, sharp LA potentials help identify an optimal anular location of LV electrode. This technique may have clinical usefulness for ablating left free-wall accessory atrioventricular connections.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular end-systolic pressure-wall thickness and pressure-segment length relations have been used to assess regional myocardial contractility. The purpose of these studies was to determine whether the method of afterload alteration, coronary perfusion pressure, and the definition of end systole affected regional end-systolic relations. In paced open-chest pig hearts (n = 10), left ventricular pressure, wall thickness, and segment length were measured during vena caval occlusions. First, regional end-systolic relations were obtained before and after an increase in afterload with intravenous phenylephrine. This comparison was performed with the coronary circulation intact (closed loop) and with coronary perfusion pressure controlled extracorporeally (open loop). Second, with the open-loop preparation, the independent effect of a range of coronary perfusion pressures (45-155 mm Hg) on end-systolic relations was assessed. In both procedures, end systole was defined by the maximal isochronal slope, termed regional Emax, and by the maximal ratio of left ventricular pressure to regional dimension, termed Ees. In the first procedure, the slope and x-axis intercept of regional Emax were unchanged with phenylephrine. In contrast, the slope of Ees decreased with phenylephrine, consistent with a decrease in contractility. The extrapolated x-axis intercept of Ees shifted in a direction consistent with an increase in contractility. In the second procedure, increases in coronary perfusion pressure did not affect regional Emax but increased the slope of Ees. A decrease in the coronary perfusion pressure, particularly with ischemia, shifted the x-axis intercepts of both Emax and Ees in a direction consistent with a decrease in contractility. Thus, regional end-systolic relations in intact hearts are dependent on the method of afterload alteration and the coronary perfusion pressure. Furthermore, Emax differs from Ees, so the assessment of regional relations depends on how end systole is defined.\r"

Renal blood flow, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were measured. Both dosages of fenoldopam increased renal blood flow without altering blood pressure, similar to the effects of DA (1 and 2 micrograms/kg/min). Administration of fenoldopam with only DA (1 microgram/kg/min) produced further increase in renal blood flow. After administration of phenoxybenzamine (15 mg/kg i.v.), DA produced significant increments in renal blood flow and reductions in renal vascular resistance when compared with experiments without phenoxybenzamine, suggesting even low dosages of DA exert alpha-adrenoceptor agonist activity. Dobutamine (2 and 4 micrograms/kg/min) increased renal blood flow about 37% of that produced by DA. Fenoldopam added to dobutamine produced similar increments in renal blood flow as DA. Fenoldopam did not affect the increase in cardiac contractile force produced by DA and dobutamine. Thus, fenoldopam alone or in combination with DA had no advantage over 2 and 4 micrograms/kg/min DA to further increase renal blood flow. In contrast, fenoldopam with dobutamine produced greater increments in cardiac contractile force than DA and equivalent increases in renal blood flow as DA.\r"

In contrast to current practice, these patients were managed with the objective of performing a Senning operation as the definitive procedure. Five of these 100 patients died on the first day of life of sequelae of perinatal hypoxia, four died within the first month of life (often of complications of catheterization and septostomy), and three died later than the first month but before definitive operation (12% preoperative mortality). There were four operative deaths, and two late deaths have occurred to date. Actuarial survival was 84% at 5 years and 81% at 9 years. The postoperative attrition rate was 0.4 deaths per 100 patient-years. Actuarial survival of all patients treated for simple arterial transposition seems to be the best index for comparing arterial switch with interatrial repair protocols, because each protocol is associated with different patterns of preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative mortality.\r"

Metabolic substrate enhancement has been shown to be necessary for the survival and homeostasis of the functioning preparation. To define basic metabolic requirements and to determine the resting energy expenditure of the working canine heart-lung preparation, two groups were studied. Ten canine heart-lung blocks were placed in a normothermic autoperfusion circuit. In Group 1 (n = 5), a hyperalimentation solution of balanced substrate was infused (15% dextrose, 4.25% amino acids, 8 meq magnesium sulfate, 30 IU/dl insulin, and 10% lipids). In Group 2 (n = 5), no substrate was given. The preparations were ventilated with a mixture of room air and 5% CO2 at a rate of 4 breaths/min to maintain physiological pH. Myocardial function was assessed by cardiac output determinations and mixed venous gases. Pulmonary function was assessed with arterial blood gases. The oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured with a Metabolic Cart, and the resting energy expenditure was calculated. The mean survival time for Group 1 was 360 minutes, and all preparations were terminated electively. The mean survival time for Group 2 was 219 +/- 43 minutes (p less than 0.01) with congestive heart failure as the common terminal event. All parameters of cardiac function and blood gases remained within physiological limits without significant differences between groups. The resting energy expenditure, a measure of metabolic rate, was 2.5 +/- 0.3 kcal/hr in Group 1 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 in Group 2 at termination (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated 45 patients treated with centrifugal (n = 18) or pulsatile (n = 27) VAD for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock to determine the effect of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) on survival. The patients ranged in age from 15 to 72 years (mean age, 55.1 years). VAD support was left ventricular in 29, right ventricular in seven, and biventricular in nine, and the flow-rate range was 1.6-5.2 l/min (mean rate, 3.97 l/min) for 0.2-22 days (mean time, 4.1 days). PMI was determined by analysis of postoperative electrocardiogram (EKG), enzyme levels, or at necropsy. PMI was considered \"possible\" if there were either EKG or enzyme level changes, and \"definite\" if there were EKG and enzyme level changes or necropsy evidence. Of the 45 patients, 19 were successfully weaned from ventricular assistance; 12 were discharged (Group 1), and seven died (Group 2); the remaining 26 patients could not be weaned from VAD support (Group 3). In Group 1, one patient had a definite PMI, and three had a possible PMI. Among the 33 nonsurvivors (Groups 2 and 3), 24 patients had PMI by necropsy examination. Definite PMI was much more common in nonsurvivors (72.7%) than in survivors (8.3%) (p less than 0.05). However, Group 2 nonsurvivors were weaned despite PMI in 100% of cases. These data suggest that, although PMI is a strong negative determinant of survival in postcardiotomy patients, it cannot be considered a contraindication because it does not preclude myocardial recovery.\r"

The maximum exercise tolerance was 67 W with SSI 70, 71 W with Activitrax pacing, and 91 W with Nova MR pacing; the maximum oxygen uptake as 17.6, 19.5, and 21.5 ml/min/kg, respectively. The highest heart rate achieved was 81 beats/min with SSI 70, 98 beats/min with the Activitrax, and 118 beats/min with the Nova MR on average; the mean rate increase from rest to maximum exercise was 11, 29, and 47 beats/min, respectively. With both rate-adaptive types of pacing (Nova MR and Activitrax), an increase in exercise tolerance and maximum heart rate could be achieved, but this increase was significantly more obvious with the temperature-controlled Nova MR than with the activity-controlled Activitrax. However, with a different form of exercise, for example, treadmill ergometry, the rate response of the Activitrax would presumably have been somewhat clearer.\r"

Ischemia reduced myocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) content by 37%. Left ventricular performance was assessed from pressure-dimension loops generated by minor-axis-diameter crystals for a range of controlled loading as high as end-diastolic pressures of 15 mm Hg. Myocardial oxygen consumption was determined at 6-9 steady-state steps throughout this range, including those at basal conditions of the empty beating ventricle. The hearts were artificially paced at 160 beats/min. Higher oxygen consumption with epinephrine (0.5 microgram/min/kg) administration was demonstrated at all levels of left ventricular performance and at all end-diastolic lengths. Several mechanisms for higher oxygen cost for similar external work performances have been suggested. From this study, it appears that increased uptake of free fatty acids, which increased threefold during epinephrine infusion, contributes to less efficient use of oxygen for mechanical work. We conclude that the use of inotropic support in ischemically injured hearts for reasons other than overt heart failure is not well based because myocardial oxygen consumption increases even when greater work is performed at lower end-diastolic dimensions.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular tachycardia that requires surgical management frequently arises from intramural sites in the ventricular septum. However, epicardial and endocardial activation-time maps are incapable of identifying these intramural sites. To overcome this limitation, we have developed potential-distribution mapping with newly designed epicardial and endocardial electrodes for the right and left ventricles. During normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in eight dogs, these endocardial electrodes were introduced into the right ventricular and left ventricular cavities through right and left atriotomies. The heart was paced with a plunge-needle electrode positioned to mimic ventricular tachycardias originating intramurally in the ventricular septum. Potential-distribution maps were then constructed from 61 epicardial, 30 right ventricular endocardial, and 31 left ventricular endocardial unipolar electrograms to determine if surface potential-distribution maps could localize the intramural septal pacing site. The primary potential minima (less than -3 mV) in both right ventricular and left ventricular endocardium occurred in the electrodes closest to the intramural septal pacing site. At the instant of occurrence of the primary potential minimum, the amplitude of the adjacent potential maximum was more positive when the pacing site was more distant from the endocardial surface. Therefore, the amplitude of the coexisting potential maximum was an important indicator of depth of the pacing site. The time difference between the occurrence of right ventricular and left ventricular primary potential minima correlated with depth of the intramural pacing site and was also a valid predictor of the intramural pacing site. The intramural pacing site interpolated from the endocardial sites and the time difference of right ventricular and left ventricular primary potential minima was within 3.2 +/- 1.2 mm of the actual pacing site determined by postmortem examination. Endocardial breakthrough of wavefronts on the right ventricular and left ventricular septal surfaces obtained from corresponding activation-time maps were less accurate in indicating the electrodes closest to the pacing site. Neither epicardial activation-time maps nor potential-distribution maps were capable of identifying the intramural septal pacing site. Thus, unlike conventional endocardial activation-time maps, endocardial potential-distribution maps are capable of more accurate localization of the origin of ventricular tachycardias arising in the intramural ventricular septum.\r"

We prospectively studied 59 patients for 18 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD) years postoperatively by Doppler echocardiography and by 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring. Right ventricular outflow gradients were estimated from the peak continuous-wave Doppler pulmonary artery velocity. The severity of valvular regurgitation was determined by mapping the proximal chamber by pulsed Doppler methods. Right ventricular diastolic cavity area was measured by planimetry of the apical image. The right ventricular outflow tract gradient had a mean value of 9.4 +/- 9.0 mm Hg (range, 0-58 mm Hg; median, 6.6 mm Hg). Pulmonary regurgitation was present in 78% of patients, with 59% of patients graded as mild and 19% as moderate. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in 65% of patients, with 56% of patients graded as mild, 7% as moderate, and 2% as severe. The severity of pulmonary regurgitation correlated with right ventricular cavity area (p less than 0.05). The severity of tricuspid regurgitation was not related to pulmonary stenosis or to the severity of pulmonary regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation is unusual (n = 11) and correlates with aortic root size. The frequency and type of ventricular arrhythmia were not related to the severity of pulmonary stenosis; however, ventricular bigeminy and couplets were related to the severity of pulmonary regurgitation (p less than 0.025). The majority of patients with total repair of tetralogy of Fallot have remarkably good long-term valvular function. For the minority with moderate or severe valvular dysfunction, pulmonary regurgitation is the best marker for ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Therefore, this technique may provide a practical and effective method for treating patients undergoing a major cardiac catastrophe who are unresponsive to the usual resuscitative efforts. We tested whether PCPB could effectively unload the heart and provide myocardial salvage during left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion complicated by ventricular fibrillation in the canine model (n = 13). All 13 dogs fibrillated within 20 minutes of LAD occlusion, and none could be successfully resuscitated by manual cardiac compression, sodium bicarbonate administration, antiarrhythmic agent administration, and electrical defibrillation. All 13 dogs were then placed on PCPB by way of the right jugular vein and right femoral artery; in seven, we used a synchronous pulsatile pump and in six a standard roller pump. No vent was placed in the left ventricle. All animals returned to normal sinus rhythm within 20 minutes of institution of PCPB. The LAD snare was released after 2 hours, and all animals were maintained on PCPB during 3 hours of reperfusion. At sacrifice, the area of infarction was determined by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and was expressed as a percentage of the left ventricular area-at-risk for infarction. The tension time index was also measured and expressed as percent change from baseline. The left ventricular area-at-risk for infarction was similar in both groups (31.5% for roller pump vs. 29.2% for pulsatile pump; p greater than 0.05), but the area of infarction as a percentage of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the pulsatile-pump group (22.0%) than in the roller-pump group (35.4%; p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Superimposition of cardioplegic arrest on acute low-cardiac-output states, as may occur after failure of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty requiring emergency surgery, is associated with an increased operative risk. This increased risk is possibly attributable to reperfusion, which, after sequential episodes of myocardial ischemia, exacerbates tissue injury mediated by oxygen free radicals. One of the most cytotoxic of these active oxygen species is the hydroxyl radical, which is formed from superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide through an iron-catalyzed reaction. This study assesses the effects of peroxidase, a hydrogen-peroxide scavenger, and of deferoxamine, an iron chelator, in isolated working rat hearts subjected to 30 minutes of low-flow ischemia (75% reduction in coronary flow) followed by 2 hours of cardioplegic arrest at 15 degrees C and by 30 minutes of normothermic reperfusion. Three groups of hearts (n = 7) were studied. Two groups were pretreated with either peroxidase (10,000 units/l) or deferoxamine (0.03 mM) during the last 15 minutes of the low-flow ischemic period. The third group received no prearrest intervention and served as a control group.

In four dogs, the LDPGs were stimulated chronically; the remaining four dogs served as unstimulated controls. Right-sided cardiac filling pressures were normal in all dogs when measured 4 months after graft application. Mean tension generated by the viable LDPGs was 153 +/- 49.9 g. LDPGs contracting in synchrony with the heart did not increase cardiac output. In one dog, the aortic pressure changed from 140/100 to 155/85 mm Hg during synchronous contraction of the LDPG. Three dogs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and their hearts were placed in fibrillation. The LDPGs were then stimulated at a burst frequency of 85 Hz and contracted vigorously. Under these conditions, the left ventricular pressure increased by an average of 15 mm Hg with each LDPG contraction; however, the mean aortic pressure was virtually unchanged. Left ventricular and aortic pressures of 125/20 and 125/65 mm Hg, respectively, could be obtained with manual compression of the fibrillating heart. This study indicates that although LDPGs can be made to contract chronically and in synchrony with the heart, they do not necessarily augment left ventricular performance.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical case is reported indicating that intracranial pressure (ICP) rises with cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta (CCTA) in humans and does not fall if arterial blood pressure (BP) is lowered by nitroprusside. Hantler and Knight (Anesthesiology 1982;56:146-147) also reported a similar case. We investigated this phenomenon prospectively, measuring ICP, aortic arch BP, and right atrial pressure in 10 halothane-anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits ventilated to pH 7.45-7.55. When CCTA was applied, BP and ICP rose significantly (by paired t test, p less than or equal to 0.01), although right atrial pressure did not change. After removal of the cross-clamp and a period of stabilization, BP was elevated to the same level as that attained with CCTA with phenylephrine. Although phenylephrine induced BP elevation, neither ICP nor CVP changed significantly from control or recovery measurements. In six animals, after applying CCTA, BP was lowered to control levels with nitroprusside (in combination with CCTA). Nitroprusside was effective in lowering BP to control level, but ICP remained elevated as long as the cross-clamping continued. With no rise in central venous pressure, venous engorgement is an unlikely mechanism for ICP elevation. Time constants of ICP change are too short to invoke increased cerebral spinal fluid production or decreased absorption. BP does not rise above the expected range for autoregulation, but recruitment of either arterial capacitance vessels or of a neuroreflex arc, or the effects of cord ischemia disrupting cerebral autoregulation may be the cause of an acute increase in cerebral blood volume.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical management of patients with biventricular hearts and complex double-outlet right ventricle with noncommitted ventricular septal defect, hypoplastic ventricles, common atrioventricular orifice, straddling tricuspid valve, and straddling mitral valves is controversial. More recently at our institution, 23 of these patients underwent Fontan-type procedures as an alternative to the intraventricular tunnel repair. In all cases, the presence of more than one associated anomaly would have prevented adequate biventricular correction. The ventricular septal defects were of the inlet type in 14 patients, inlet and subpulmonary in one, multiple in one, subpulmonary in three, and subaortic in four. Twenty-one patients had atrioventricular junction anomalies, and 14 had hypoplastic ventricles (left ventricle in 11 and right ventricle in three). Pulmonary stenosis was present in 13 patients and pulmonary atresia in two. At operation, an extracardiac conduit was used in two patients and an atriopulmonary direct anastomosis in 21. There were six hospital deaths (26%). Seventeen patients had a mean follow-up period of 25 months. At the follow-up evaluation, nine patients were assigned to New York Heart Association Class I and seven to Class II; one patient assigned to Class IV died at 9 months postoperatively. Cumulative mortality was 30.4% (seven deaths). Univariate analysis identified hypoplastic left ventricle with any type of ventricular septal defect and atrioventricular junction as the only incremental risk factor for early and late outcome (p less than 0.01), which also influenced functional status and use of drug therapy (p less than 0.01) at the time of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89029065\r", 
  ".W": "In our approach to dynamic cardiomyoplasty, which consists of wrapping a skeletal muscle around the heart and stimulating the former in synchrony with heart contractions to augment ventricular contractility, we have transferred a latissimus dorsi muscle flap to the heart by way of a partial resection of the second rib and subsequently suturing the muscle flap around the ventricles. The muscle flap is stimulated by a Cardio-Myostimulator burst-pulse generator (Medtronic SP 1005) connected to intramuscular electrodes. In preclinical animal research, the latissimus dorsi muscle flap was shown to maintain adequate contractile force and to increase its fatigue resistance by gradual conversion of glycolytic-fatigue-sensitive-to-oxidative-fatigue-resistant muscular fibers (100%). Histochemical and biochemical studies of chronically stimulated muscles showed a total transformation of muscle fast myosin to slow myosin with characteristics similar to those of myocardium. Electron microscopy showed preserved myofibrillar cytoarchitecture and increased mitochondrial density in the cell. At 9 months, cardiac output and ultrasonic Doppler studies showed a significant increase in ventricular function (cardiac output, +21%; peak blood velocity, +40% -80%; and stroke volume, +98% -102%) during muscle stimulation. In the clinical situation, long-term (range of follow-up interval, 4-42 months) beneficial cardiac effects of cardiomyoplasty have been documented in eight patients with various pathologies (ventricular tumor, left ventricular aneurysm, ischemic disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy). Our current understanding of this process is that dynamic cardiomyoplasty acts in two ways: 1) it promotes more vigorous systolic contraction, and 2) it appears to limit heart dilatation.\r"

Animals were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and cooled systemically. The aorta was clamped, and the hearts were arrested with a bolus infusion of hypothermic (4 degrees C) hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution delivered either into the aortic root or through a balloon catheter placed in the coronary sinus. After 45 minutes of ischemic arrest, hearts were reperfused, and blood flow patterns were measured at 1, 5, 10, and 60 minutes. In the normal region, a significant hyperemia occurred with both CSC and ARC. However, the peak reactive transmural flow was 120% more with ARC than with CSC (4.55 +/- 0.45 vs. 2.12 +/- 0.19 ml/min/g, respectively; p less than 0.05) and remained elevated after 60 minutes of reperfusion, when CSC flows had returned to control levels. In the collateral-dependent region, a significant hyperemia was observed with ARC that persisted throughout reperfusion. However, with CSC, no significant changes in blood flow were detected at any time during reperfusion. Thus, the decreased hyperemic response after arrest suggests a reduced energetic debt with CSC compared with ARC and may indicate superior myocardial protection with CSC. This is particularly evident in chronically inflow-restricted myocardial regions.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to differentiate myocardial reperfusion injury from that of ischemia. We assessed the role of the myocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) catabolites, hypoxanthine and xanthine, generated during ischemia and the early phase of reperfusion, in reperfusion injury by modulating adenosine transport and metabolism with specific metabolic inhibitors. This was followed by intracoronary infusion of exogenous hypoxanthine and xanthine. Twenty-four dogs instrumented with minor-axis piezoelectric crystals and intraventricular pressure transducers were subjected to 30 minutes of normothermic global myocardial ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion. In Group 1 (n = 7), normal saline was infused into the cardiopulmonary bypass reservior before ischemia and before reperfusion. Saline solution containing 25 microM p-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and 100 microM erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) was infused in Group 2 (n = 10) dogs. Group 3 (n = 7) dogs were treated exactly like those in Group 2 except, at the end of the ischemic period and immediately before releasing the cross-clamp, a solution of EHNA-NBMPR containing 100 microM hypoxanthine and 100 microM xanthine was infused into the aortic root. Left ventricular performance and myocardial adenine nucleotide pool intermediates were determined before and after ischemia. ATP was depleted by about 50% (p less than 0.05 vs. preischemia) in all groups after 30 minutes of ischemia. Inosine was the major ATP catabolite (9.29 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg protein) in Group 1, while adenosine (9.91 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg protein) was the major metabolite in EHNA-NBMPR-treated dogs (Groups 2 and 3). Hypoxanthine levels were fivefold more in Group 1 compared with Groups 2 and 3 (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular performance in Group 1 decreased from 76.8 +/- 7.6 to 42.9 +/- 9.8 and 52.3 +/- 8.4 dynes/cm2 x 10(3) (p less than 0.05), while myocardial ATP decreased from 30.9 +/- 2.2 to 17.2 +/- 1.0 and 16.5 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg protein during 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion, respectively (p less than 0.05 vs. preischemia). Ventricular function in Group 2 dogs completely recovered within 30 minutes of reperfusion, and myocardial ATP recovered to the preischemic level at 60 minutes of reperfusion. In Group 3, left ventricular performance was depressed by 39% and 30% during 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05), respectively, and myocardial ATP did not recover during reperfusion despite a significant intramyocardial adenosine accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The results of early correction were therefore assessed in 12 children with transposition of the great arteries and a large VSD who underwent arterial repair. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 90 days (median age, 19 days) and in weight from 2.5 to 3.7 kg. The VSD was infundibular in eight, inlet in three, and muscular in one. Coronary artery anomalies were present in five patients, including one patient with a single left coronary artery. There was one early death (8%) in the only patient with a pulmonary artery band. There were no late deaths. The 11 survivors have been followed up from 2 to 59 months (mean follow-up period, 20 months) and remain free of cardiac symptoms. Catheterization (n = 5) and Doppler echocardiography in all patients show no significant left ventricular outflow obstruction, aortic insufficiency, or residual VSD. Catheterization documented normal pulmonary artery pressure and unobstructed coronary arteries. Only one patient had significant pulmonary stenosis and underwent successful reoperation. These data indicate that arterial repair and VSD closure can be successfully performed in early infancy with low mortality and morbidity. Repair in this age group is advocated before changes of pulmonary vascular disease occur.\r"

The indication for this approach was either preoperative aortic outlet obstruction or likelihood that the repair would produce such obstruction. A modification of the original technique is introduced that involves transection of both great arteries, anastomosis of the contiguous aortic and pulmonic walls, and connection of the distal aorta to the perimeter of the new (bivalved) great artery. Eleven of the 16 patients survived operation: six of six who underwent a concurrent Fontan operation, four of six who underwent a concurrent right-ventricle-to-pulmonary-artery-conduit procedure, and one of four who underwent a concurrent systemic-pulmonary shunt procedure. Postoperative status in the 11 survivors is good: one patient has a gradient from the left ventricle to the aorta, 10 of 11 have little or no aortic regurgitation, and the remaining patients have a normal physiological status. We conclude that the Damus procedure is a useful addition to the surgical armamentarium for treatment of certain types of cyanotic congenital heart disease.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups. Thirty-one patients had severe congestive heart failure in infancy and presently have a large ventricular septal defect that has no tendency to close or to produce aortic valve regurgitation (Group 1). Ideally, these defects should be closed in infancy, and the transpulmonary approach is recommended to achieve closure. In the first group, there was one death in a patient with a hypoplastic right ventricle. In Group 2, nineteen patients had aortic valve prolapse or aortic valve regurgitation. The DCVSD were moderately large or small. A number of DCVSD in Group 2 patients had maintained the normal offsetting of the arterial valves. These defects must be closed by the time mild aortic valve regurgitation has occurred. In Group 2, there was one late death in a patient who developed subacute bacterial endocarditis. The two patients who had severe aortic valve regurgitation required aortic valve replacement and underwent multiple surgical procedures to replace calcified bioprostheses. Group 3 comprised 13 patients who were diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot. All of these patients had a large DCVSD with aortic valve overriding. All Group 3 patients survived radical repair of the defect, which required a transannular patch in most cases (76%).\r"

  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1986, 26 patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and multifocal pulmonary blood supply underwent surgery (median age, 2 years) to reconnect major aortopulmonary collateral arteries to other collateral arteries or to the central pulmonary arteries in an attempt to prepare the pulmonary circulation for complete repair. In four patients, central pulmonary arteries were found to be absent at exploratory thoracotomy, and therefore, the surgery aimed for optimal palliation. Four (15%) patients died perioperatively. The survivors had symptomatic improvement. At restudy 1 week-110 months (median time, 25 months) postoperatively, modest growth of central pulmonary arteries had occurred [right plus left pulmonary artery diameters/descending aortic diameter from 0.64 +/- 0.61 (mean +/- SD) preoperatively to 0.95 +/- 0.60 postoperatively (p less than 0.01)], with a greater number of bronchopulmonary segments connected to central pulmonary arteries [from 6.3 +/- 4.8 preoperatively to 10.0 +/- 4.5 postoperatively (p less than 0.001)]. However, only seven (27%) patients met the established criteria for repair, of whom three (12%) have undergone definitive surgery. Thirteen (50%) patients are unsuitable for repair, and two (8%) await restudy. Failure of anastomoses involving major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (13 of 33) was higher than for grafts from a systemic artery to the central pulmonary artery (1 of 22, p = 0.003). Failure was not related to the number of anastomoses per operation, suggesting that poor distal runoff may have been responsible. This surgical approach provided reasonable palliation but was rarely effective as a prelude to complete repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A simple self-perfusing self-cleaning system has been developed that kept the heart, lungs, and kidney functioning for a mean time of 24 hours. Nine adult dogs were anesthetized and artifically ventilated. The heart and lungs were removed en bloc while being perfused by the heart. One kidney was connected to the descending aorta and inferior vena cava. No anticoagulant was used. Another group of six dogs without functioning kidneys was used as the control group. In the experimental group, urine output ranged from 26 to 48 ml/hr, aortic systolic pressures were 80-107 mm Hg, heart rate was 85-100 beats/min, serum potassium content was 3.25-4.40 mmol/l, and serum sodium content was 155-163 mmol/l. In the experimental group, blood creatinine levels decreased from 0.95 to 0.47 mg/dl during preservation; in the control group, blood creatinine levels decreased from 0.96 to 0.79 mg/dl. Lung biopsies in the preparation with the longest survival showed good preservation for as long as 24 hours, and no thrombi were present. This preparation has the advantage of no ischemic time, no foreign material in the circulation, and the ability to automatically maintain acid-base balance and blood electrolytes. The simplicity of this autoperfusion preparation may allow greater transport distance in organ procurement for subsequent transplantation.\r"

Two groups of rabbit preparations were studied to evaluate the effect of hypothermia during the initial 120 minutes of harvesting (n = 8 at 36 degrees C and n = 5 at 4 degrees C). The significance of these changes was assessed in a second experiment in which lungs were reperfused in vitro at selected intervals of hypothermia (5, 12, and 24 hours) and assessed for injury. Hypothermic preservation sustained a significantly higher energy state. The depletion of energy state was correlated with injury, particularly as measured by lung edema (r2 = -0.715). Short periods of warm ischemia (30 minutes) result in a significant depletion of energy state, which may be a component of pulmonary injury during harvesting and preservation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective assessment of psychiatric morbidity in a sample of 207 patients with inner ear disorders, attending an ENT clinic, was carried out. As a group, they were found to have higher psychiatric morbidity on the general health questionnaire (GHQ) than either normal samples or samples affected by other forms of physical disease. Within the sample tinnitus patients scored the highest, and presbyacusis patients the lowest. High GHQ scores predicted an exaggerated self-rating of symptom severity in a visual analogue scale. Past psychiatric history did not play a role in the development of psychiatric morbidity. Elderly subjects complained more often of fear of collapsing in the street but this was not related, as has been suggested, to the subsequent development of agoraphobic symptoms. Factor analysis of GHQ items for the 'cases' yielded 'depression', 'anxiety' and 'personality' factors. No correlation was found between these factors and the rest of the clinical variables. It is concluded that tinnitus shows the clearest association with psychiatric morbidity and hence merits detailed psychological analysis. Such a study has been started at Addenbrooke's Hospital.\r"

Large saccules reaching the upper border of the thyroid cartilage were unilateral in 23 and bilateral in 20. Saccular volume is significantly related to ventricular volume but not to age, sex or laryngeal size. Large bilateral saccules are common and, therefore, a likely underlying factor in laryngocoele. However, the unilaterality of the disease, its male predominance and its age distribution, suggest that local laryngeal pathologies are perhaps the determinant factor in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

Flow limitation is predicted in the model by incorporation of a term describing nasal valve stiffness. The interrelationship of the alar wing and nasal valve are demonstrated and the model is discussed in terms of aiding the understanding of normal airflow physiology and what implications this may have for septal spur surgery.\r"

During suction a flow of cold, dry room air replaces the warm, moist cavity air, causing cooling both directly and by vaporization of water.

BMD for patients with bone biopsy documented osteitis fibrosa was 1.6 standard deviation (SD) above the normal value for age and sex matched controls, while those patients with low turnover osteodystrophy had a mean BMD 1.2 SD below normal (p less than 0.0001). Three patients with osteitis fibrosa who had previously been treated with prednisone had a low BMD (1.8 SD below normal, different than O, p = 0.0015). There was no correlation between BMD and time on dialysis (r = 0.1). An N terminal PTH level greater than 150 pg/ml was a sensitive (94%) and specific (100%) method of separating those patients with osteitis fibrosa from those with low turnover osteodystrophy, while BMD was much less useful in this differentiation. A low BMD was not predictive of fracture history but the type of renal osteodystrophy was. Patients with low turnover osteodystrophy had a fracture rate of 0.2 fractures/dialysis year in comparison to those with osteitis fibrosis who had 0.1 fractures/dialysis year. Patients with the former bone disease fractured mainly axial rather than appendicular bones in contrast to those patients with osteitis fibrosa. In conclusion we found that patients with osteitis fibrosa had increased BMD compared to normal while those with low turnover osteodystrophy had decreased BMD, but that the N terminal PTH level was a better predictor of the type of bone disease present than was BMD.\r"

The method, which employs access to the circulation via a double-lumen central venous catheter and a BSM 22 blood systems module, can be performed safely in the intensive care unit of a general hospital if closely supervised by a trained nephrologist. The results of treating 16 consecutive cases of complicated acute renal failure in a large general hospital without a hemodialysis unit are described. The method, whose simplicity makes it suitable for intensive care unit nurses without previous hemodialysis training, was not associated with any serious accidents or complications, and was tolerated well by even the most critically ill and hemodynamically unstable patients. The advantages of this approach over more traditional continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) are discussed.\r"

In mild CRF, both in males and females, PRL level proved to be higher than controls while its circadian rhythm of secretion disappeared. The MANOVA analysis (multivariate analysis of variance) showed that all 3 considered factors (sex, age, creatinine) have a systematic effect on PRL values, that of creatinine being the most prominent. With the progression of renal failure, the physiological PRL oscillations tended to diminish. In general, increasing creatinine levels progressively shifted the acrophase (that is the time-distance between a given hour and the maximum peak of the function) to the morning, with hemodialysis patients showing acrophases between 12 p.m. and 1 a.m. It is possible that in CRF the PRL feedback system could no longer function.\r"

The clinical features, renal biopsy findings and subsequent course were compared with those in the 14 without such changes. All 42 patients had hematuria. Eighty-two percent of the patients with the GBM changes showed progression of nephritis and 39% showed neurosensory deafness when last seen. In contrast, all patients without the GBM changes had a normal audiogram, ran a nonprogressive course and had hematuria only when last seen. Light microscopy of renal biopsy specimens revealed segmental glomerular sclerosis and interstitial foam cells only in patients with the GBM changes. Our study shows that the presence or absence of these GBM changes is the most reliable indicator of the prognosis in children with hereditary nephritis.\r"

Renal biopsy was performed at the same time to evaluate the type of the GN and to quantify interstitial cellular infiltration. Proteinuria, serum albumin and creatinine were measured. There was a significant correlation between the level of 67Ga kidney activity and the degree of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. On the contrary, no correlation was found between isotopic activity and the degree of renal failure or the degree of interstitial cellular infiltration. Increased kidney 67Ga activity did not appear characteristic of a specific histologic type of GN. Increased glomerular permeability may alter renal uptake of Ga; therefore 67Ga scanning does not appear to contribute significantly to the diagnosis and the follow-up of either primary or secondary GN.\r"

Renal function was evaluated before and five days after CDDP administration (5 mg/kg). The rats were treated with various doses of N (0.1; 0.3; 0.6 mg/kg/day) 2 days before CDDP administration and throughout the study. The severity of CDDP-induced acute renal failure was markedly modified in N-treated animals according to the daily dosage of N. At 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg BW/day, N enhanced CDDP nephrotoxicity. Serum creatinine was 637 +/- 45 and 611 +/- 71 mumoles/liter, respectively, 5 days after CDDP administration (vs. 313 +/- 24 mumoles in animals treated with CDDP alone; p less than 0.05). In these animals the plasma potassium level was significantly elevated at day 7 when compared with CDDP-treated and control rats. In contrast, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg BW/day N attenuated CDDP nephrotoxicity with a serum creatinine of 214 +/- 35 mumoles at the end of the study. The pathologic changes were also more severe in the groups receiving 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg of nifedipine. We postulate that at the higher doses (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg) the systemic hemodynamic effects of nifedipine may override the potentially beneficial intrarenal effect which may account for the favorable results recorded with a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg.\r"

  ".W": "Because renal vasodilator systems may be involved in the physiologic response to a protein meal, we studied the relationship of prostaglandin E (PGE) and kallikrein (KE) activity to the renal hemodynamic changes induced by a meat meal. Ten normal subjects on a maintenance diet providing 1 g protein per kg and 100 mmol Na daily were studied before and after a meal of 86 g of meat protein, once without medication, and again after treatment with indomethacin (150 mg daily for 3 days before and 50 mg the morning of the test). A carbohydrate meal of similar caloric, Na and K content was used in control studies. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR, inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF, para-aminohippurate [PAH] clearance), PGE and kallikrein urinary excretion were determined. All studies were performed during water diuresis to avoid bladder catheterization. The protein load induced an increase in GFR (ml/min, mean +/- s.e.m.: baseline 107.2 +/- 6.05, peak postmeal 146.4 +/- 6.79, p less than 0.01) and RBF (baseline 529.7 +/- 42.9, postmeal 678.9 +/- 61.9, p less than 0.05). Renal hemodynamic changes were unrelated to changes in urinary PGE and KE excretion. Indomethacin treatment inhibited PGE excretion by 73% during the test meal but did not modify the protein-induced hyperfiltration. Our results suggest that these renal vasodilator systems are not primarily responsible for the hyperfiltration response. In addition, the data show that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is not a practical approach to prevent glomerular hyperfiltration in clinical practice.\r"

A 50-year-old man with an eight-year history of hemodialysis treatment was admitted because of headache, nausea and double vision. Computed tomographic scans and nuclear magnetic resonance revealed intracranial abnormal shadow. The left vertebral arteriography showed that the distal portion of the left vertebral artery was dilated to 17 mm in diameter. The basilar artery showed a large tortuous vascular channel and globular aneurysms over 25 mm in diameter. This giant serpentine aneurysm is a rather rare disease. To our knowledge, it has not been reported as a complication in a hemodialysis patient, although fourteen cases have been reported in the literature. In our case, several conditions such as long-term hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, atherosclerosis and abnormal blood flow due to arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis treatment might be considered to play a role in the formation of the giant serpentine aneurysms.\r"

Improvement of hemodynamic parameters was especially pronounced in older patients, who had cardiac risk factors in a high percentage of cases. Age and cardiac risk factors had the highest impact on the outcome, thus explaining the higher mortality in the older patient group. Older patients with renal insufficiency can be treated with CAPD leading to equally good results as those documented for younger patients.\r"

  ".W": "In patients on peritoneal dialysis drug movement across the peritoneum depends on the physiology of the peritoneal membrane, the physiochemical properties of the drug, the dialysis regimen and the basic pharmacokinetic properties of the particular pharmacon. Besides the low dialysate flow rate in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the latter point-drug kinetics-is thought to be of major importance for the influence of CAPD on drug kinetics. The eliminative potency of CAPD for drugs is limited due to the low dialysate outflow rate, an unfavorable ratio of the dialysate to the body volumes of distribution, the usually low ratio of the peritoneal to body clearance and the effect of drug protein binding. With intraperitoneal application, the drug appears rapidly in the circulation. This again results from the large differences in the volumes of the body to the peritoneal compartments, leading to a high concentration gradient across the peritoneal membrane. Thus a rapid disappearance of a pharmacon from the peritoneal cavity following intraperitoneal application combined with an insufficient drug elimination by CAPD may be explained by basic pharmacokinetic considerations. Unidirectional peritoneal transport of a particular drug has so far not been demonstrated.\r"

Method choice was left to the patient, after extensive counselling. However, CAPD selection was very negative, and CAPD patients were older, with a much larger percentage of diabetics and loaded by more risk factors, suggesting an influence of the staff preferences on patient choice. After a first period with unsatisfactory results, we obtained an important improvement of patient and method survival coinciding with the introduction of a new connector with disinfectant (Y-system) which allowed a reduction of peritonitis rate to 1 episode for 36 patient/months. For the period 1.1.81 to 31.12.86 a comparison was made (life table analysis) between new ESRF patients placed initially on CAPD or on HD. The 5-year survival was not statistically different in spite of the very negative CAPD selection of patients, who were 10 years older, on the average. Excluding diabetics, survival curves were identical in the two methods. Age at death and causes of death were not different. Method survival was better on HD (98% vs. 71% on CAPD, at 5 years, p less than 0.01): significance and limits of this evaluation are discussed. Drop-out figures were definitely lower than in the literature and this was attributed to the sharp reduction in peritonitis rate. Only 1.7% of CAPD patients discontinued the method due to inadequate ultrafiltration. In 29 CAPD and 28 HD patients with more than 4 years treatment some biochemical and clinical data were compared. Serum cholesterol was significantly higher and serum proteins lower in CAPD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The approach to treatment selection and the results of treatment including peritonitis rates and patient outcomes are described in the different groups. CCPD has become the treatment of choice for infants and children with ESRD awaiting kidney transplantation. In adults it is a considered a reasonable alternative, and may be the preferred dialysis, modality, in elderly patients, patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with severe cardiovascular disease who require or prefer assistance, who wish to be at home, and who tolerate hemodialysis poorly.

Compiled yearly, the clinical and therapeutical data were processed on a PDP 11-32 computer, according to UCLA BMPD-1L procedure. The survival rate was conditioned by age (more than 70) and by major clinical risk factors, with a large fraction of the deaths due to cardiovascular causes (40.6%) and cachexia (17.8%). The progressive reduction of peritonitis incidence (1/18.5 episodes/patient-month globally reached at the end of 1985) was due mainly to the wide spread adoption of the \"Y\" connection set (76% for 1985) and contributed to a decrease in drop-outs to 7.5% of 676 patients on CAPD during 1985.\r"

One hundred and seventy-seven patients (103M, 74F) started CAPD before December, 1981. There was no difference in primary renal disease. Age was significantly greater in 2 units (51.9 +/- 11.7 and 53.2 +/- 12.1 vs 40.6 +/- 16.2 and 42.5 +/- 14.6 years, p less than 0.05) and correlates with pre-CAPD activity scores (Scale 3-0). After 4 years: 34 patients (19.2%) remained on CAPD: the proportion was similar in all centers. Sixty-five percent of patients were alive but 54% transferred to HD mainly due to peritonitis (overall 2.0 episodes/intercenter variation p less than 0.001). Fourty-four patients were transplanted. Significant increases occurred in hemoglobin, albumin, calcium and creatinine; a decrease in activity score (2.4 +/- 0.7 to 1.5 +/- 0.9, p less than 0.005); no change in weight, BP, urea or bone disease. Thirty-eight patients died, mainly cardiac (14) or sepsis (11). Using Cox's method of analysis significant risk multipliers were age (2.07 per decade), male sex (2.18), frequency of peritonitis (1.36), activity score less than 2 (4.45) and amyloidosis (12.45). Despite differing techniques in different centers CAPD offered a satisfactory mode of therapy for many patients; peritonitis was the main reason for transfer to HD and several significant factors were identified.\r"

Twelve subsequently have experienced fatigue fracture of the patellar component at the peg-plate junction. All fractured patellar components demonstrated excellent ingrowth and fixation of the porous titanium fiber mesh-peg surfaces with no ingrowth into the porous plate underlying the polyethylene patellar surface. While the initial group of 122 arthroplasties was only slightly greater than one-third male, the preponderance of patellar fractures was in males (ten of 12). Patients with patellar component failure were on average younger and heavier and had a greater range of knee motion than the index group. The average time from implantation to recognition of fracture was 24 months. Biomechanical analysis of the force system about a domed patella demonstrated that loading of the patellofemoral joint results in eccentric loading of the dome surface. Peg fixation not accompanied by fixation of the overlying plate allows these high eccentric forces to load the peg-plate junction in shear with consequent fatigue at the peg-plate junction. These results indicate that the shear forces are sufficiently high to warrant caution in the use of peg-plate systems in which peg ingrowth without plate ingrowth occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The satisfactory knees had an average arc of motion of 100 degrees, while the unsatisfactory knees had an average arc of motion of 80 degrees. Fourteen fractures through the mid-body or superior pole of the patella not involving the implant, cement, or quadriceps mechanism (Type I) and two nondisplaced fractures through the inferior pole of the patella (Type IIIB) were managed nonoperatively, with all knees rating either a good or excellent score. Fractures of the patella disrupting the quadriceps mechanism or implant/bone/cement composite (Type II) were managed operatively in the six knees. Fractures of the inferior pole of the patella with disruption of the patellar ligament (Type IIIA) were managed operatively in seven of eight knees (one patient refused surgery). Lateral fracture-dislocations were managed operatively in all six knees. Six of the knees operated upon had a good or better score, and nine knees were rated as poor or failed.

The implant (47 knees) and nonimplant (53 knees) groups were comparable with respect to age, body size, and length of follow-up period. The analysis revealed equivocal results. Considering all diagnostic categories combined, rest pain was marginally better in the resurfaced group (p = 0.04), but this difference resulted from an unequal distribution of subjects between mild and zero pain categories. Pain with walking, maximum walking distance, ability to climb stairs and rise from a chair, active arc of motion, extensor lag, and quadriceps strength were similar in the two groups. When the DJD group was considered separately, no significant difference emerged. There was little evidence to support a recommendation for routine patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty.\r"

The ilioischial line projects over the medial acetabulum only fortuitously on the straight anteroposterior (AP) roentgenogram. Because of parallax, the relationship between the ilioischial line and the teardrop changes for views varying as little as 10 degrees in horizontal obliquity from the true AP roentgenogram. Because the teardrop comprises a well-defined, constant portion of the medial acetabular wall whereas the ilioischial line does not, the authors recommend using the acetabular teardrop rather than the ilioischial line for the detection and measurement of medial and superior acetabular migration.\r"

Although more emphasis is currently being placed on cementless arthroplasty, there is a large population of patients with cemented arthroplasties, and a number of surgeons continue to use pressurized cementing techniques. The diagnosis of stress fracture should be considered in addition to diagnoses of infection and loosening in patients with painful THAs and extruded femoral cement. Once the diagnosis of stress fracture is established, the authors advocate cement excision to the level of the endosteal cortex and bone grafting. The history of recent abrupt onset of pain and the bone scan with focal uptake have been found to be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis.\r"

Three extremities had partial release of the hamstring tendons behind the knee; the remaining 43 extremities had a complete release. The average position of the knee was 61.4 degrees of flexion preoperatively and 6 degrees postoperatively. The follow-up period averaged 21.3 months. Preoperatively, 87% of patients were nonambulatory. Following hamstring release 43% became ambulatory and 17% had gained the ability to transfer. Complications included two stroke patients with severe peripheral vascular disease; one developed a large nonhealing sore of the ankle and the other developed gangrene of the foot. Both patients required amputation. Three other patients developed recurrent flexion contractures that have since been rereleased with good results.\r"

Complications included three knees with presumed deep infection and three knees with tibial stud fractures. Aseptic loosening did not occur, although sinkage of the tibial component was observed. Revision arthroplasty was not successful mainly because of poor residual bone stock. Salvage surgery included three successful arthrodeses. The high incidence of patellofemoral problems and violation of bone stock make the current surface replacements attractive alternatives for TKA.\r"

Treatment of these patients consisted of thorough debridement of all infected tissue and components; a cement spacer was used in ten patients. The cement was impregnated with antibiotics. This procedure was followed for an average of 4.2 weeks with intravenous antibiotics and TKA utilizing antibiotic-impregnated cement. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis and ten had osteoarthritis. The organisms included Staphylococcus coagulase negative (seven patients), Streptococcus group B (two patients), Streptococcus bovis (one patient), Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase positive and Bacillus circulans (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa (one patient), and Clostridium perfringens (one patient). Of the 15 patients, 12 appeared to be free of infection, two were obvious failures and required knee fusion, and one was suspected of having continued infection at five years and was treated elsewhere. Eleven patients with revision TKA were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 2.9 years (range, one to six years). One patient died five years after reimplantation but had been functioning well. One patient functioning at three years postreimplantation did not return for a later follow-up examination. The average knee score (modification of the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score) was 75.5 points (range, 48-94); average flexion was 81 degrees (range, 52 degrees-120 degrees), and average extension was +6 degrees (range, 0 degrees-30 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For controls byproducts of BMP/NCP purification, bone marrow, eight nonskeletal tissues, purified matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich protein (MGP), and a composite of BMP/NCP and polylactic-polyglycolic acid polymer (PLA/PGA) were also implanted in the periosteal bone interface. Quantitative microcomputer image analysis and histologic studies were performed three weeks after the implantation. BMP/NCP and bone marrow or BMP/NCP implanted over a single drill hole into the marrow cavity produced three times more new bone than the bone marrow alone. BMP/NCP alone produced twice as much new bone as bone marrow alone. Control implants of bovine serum albumin or purified MGP produced no new bone. Autogeneic minced muscle and ten nonskeletal tissue controls produced little or no bone formation. Even at one-fifth of the dose of BMP/NCP, a composite of PLA/PGA incorporating BMP/NCP showed almost the same amount of new bone as BMP alone. Histologically, the response to BMP/NCP consisted of an external callus of calcifying cartilage and woven bone. The response to subperiosteal implants of BMP/NCP or BMP/NCP with bone marrow or with minced muscle occurred with the same sequence of developmental events as seen either in embryonic skeletogenesis or in fracture callus.\r"

Each chamber was implanted into the paraspinal muscle of the rabbit, where it remained for 16 weeks. The osteochondrogenic activity of the graft grew linearly when the pore size increased from 0.4 to 1.0 micron. In the chambers with a pore size of 2.0 micron, both bone and cartilage were found in only one chamber. Bone and cartilage were not found outside any of the chambers. The present results showed that the pore size of the filters significantly affected the ability of the periosteal graft to form bone and cartilage.\r"

An incision of the skin and superficial tissue only, similar to the skin incision of Groups A and B, was performed on rabbits in Group C. Certain differences in the development of the right tibia compared to the control side were observed in rabbits of Group B: (1) valgus deformity, 5 degrees-10 degrees; (2) overgrowth, 1-2 mm; (3) an S-shaped tibia deformity. The dynamics of the deformity support the mechanical theory because the direction of periosteum division was an important factor in the appearance of growth disturbances.\r"

As alternatives to sacrificing these normal structures, various allografts, xenografts, and synthetic materials have been investigated as ligament replacement materials. This study investigates Dacron fabric-covered and plain bovine xenograft tendon as such materials in the canine knee. The implants were tested to failure in an MTS machine following 13 weeks of implantation in a canine knee. Dacron woven fabric-covered implants became more firmly attached than those covered by Dacron mesh fabric or plain xenografts. The implants were also analyzed according to their method of attachment (fixation staples or sutures). Overall, the sutured implants failed at slightly higher forces than did the stapled ones. Histologically, limited vascular invasion of the xenograft was observed. No host fibrous or osseous tissue could be identified within the graft. Fibrous tissues did form between the bone and xenograft. The implants exhibited extreme intraarticular wear, which suggests a low potential for intraarticular ligament replacement.\r"

These data demonstrate differences in all parameters at different locations along the ligament and at different ages. Biochemical differences were noted between midsubstance and periinsertional areas. There were subtle differences between the two insertion sites of this ligament at all ages. These results indicate that the rabbit MCL is not homogeneous biochemically along its length and that its matrix composition changes with growth and maturation.\r"

The tibial segment was stripped of all soft tissue in one limb and the vascular pedicle was preserved in the contralateral limb. This allowed the healing of the tibial segments, vascular versus nonvascular, to be compared using sequential blood flow and roentgenographic and angiographic data. The blood flow to the vascular bone segment quadrupled at three weeks and then gradually decreased to 1.5 times baseline at one year. The nonvascular tibial segment showed a linear increase in flow for three months, achieving a level comparable to the contralateral vascular tibia segment. Peak flow in the vascular tibia at three weeks was four times that of the nonvascular tibia. Blood-vessel ingrowth from each osteotomy site progressed at a linear rate but was three times faster in the vascular bone. The deposition of callus and the rate of osteotomy healing were accelerated significantly in the vascular group. At three months 87% of the vascular tibial osteotomies healed versus 43% of the nonvascular osteotomies; these results represent significant advantages in the rate of healing in vascular versus nonvascular segmental tibial osteotomies. Segmental vascular bone grafts that are internally fixed with plate and screws can preserve the vascular structure and its advantages in bone regeneration.\r"

On level walking, cruciate-sacrificed TKA had more flexion in loading response and increased flexion and varus moments with increased muscle activity of quadriceps and biceps femoris. Abnormal gaits common to both types of knee were decreased flexion in stance and decreased single-limb stance. Both knees had a stiff-legged gait during stance. On stairs, the cruciate-sacrificed TKA substituted soleus muscle activity for knee stability. The single-limb stance and range of motion were similar for both knees. In clinical terms, the cruciate-sacrificed TKA is less efficient and has greater medial loading and higher joint reaction forces that may affect durability of the prosthesis. The five-year knee scores, patient satisfaction, and roentgenographic examinations were equal for both sets of knees.\r"

Unidirectional (varus or valgus) and total (varus and valgus) laxity were used as a basis of analysis. None of the examined parameters produced results suggesting that lax knees were worse than stable knees. Indeed, knees with increasing laxity through the categories of mild and moderate showed better statistically significant results in HSS score and pain than those with lesser degrees of laxity. Seventy-five percent of the knees with unidirectional laxity were classified as excellent; only 38.5% of the stable knees were graded as excellent (p less than 0.01). Only 9% of the lax knees had complaints of pain; 38% of the stable knees were painful (p less than 0.05). No significant difference in functional score and walking ability was noted between the lax and the stable knees.

The average age at the time of surgery was 62 years and follow-up time averaged 5.3 years. Results were determined using a modified Hungerford knee rating scale. Follow-up roentgenograms were evaluated for mechanical failure and progressive deterioration of the tibiofemoral joint. Eighteen of 25 (72%) patellofemoral arthroplasties were rated excellent or good. However, 15 of 17 patellofemoral arthroplasties (88%), all performed on women, had satisfactory results. There were seven failures. The presence of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis adversely affected the outcome; excluding the five patients with tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, 17 of 20 patellofemoral arthroplasties (85%) had satisfactory results.

Two different designs were evaluated. Twenty knees that were resurfaced with a patellar button prosthesis and implanted with conventional surgical technique constituted Group A. Twenty knees that were resurfaced with a new biconvex prosthesis and implanted with specially designed instrumentation constituted Group B. For Group A, the patellar tilt averaged 4.25 degrees preoperative and 8.35 degrees postoperative. For Group B the patellar tilt averaged 4.60 degrees preoperative and 1.83 degrees postoperative. In Group B, there was significant improvement in patellar position, with only two patients showing values exceeding the neutral range (p = 0.0409). The angle between the patellar component and the bony remnant in Group A averaged 5.975 degrees, and in Group B, 1.447 degrees. Two patients in Group A and 18 patients in Group B had values in the normal range for patellar tilt and the angle between the prosthesis and the bone. The prosthesis was inserted medial to the patellar center in six patients in Group A and one patient in Group B. A significant decrease in patellar height was noted for both groups, but values were still within the normal range. Both groups showed significant increase in the postoperative articular length, indicating that oversized prostheses were inserted and excess bone removed.\r"

The rationale for this resurfacing device and, later on, for the development of the author's total knee replacement ensemble was based on certain basic principles that were directed to the preservation of bone stock and the reconstitution of the normal knee joint modalities. Sixteen subsequent years of personal experience in the implantation of more than 1700 total knee replacements commencing in 1972, using both cemented and uncemented fixation technique, have clearly established the direct relationship between the successful results and the degree of precision in the implementation of correct anatomic principles.\r"

Diagnosis of implant failure was unknown prior to arthrotomy in seven of 25 cases (28%). Clinical findings and history were not helpful in making the diagnosis. Roentgenographic findings led to the diagnosis in 17 of 18 and were by far the most useful data. Metal-backed patellar component failure is a new complication of total knee arthroplasty and will be seen in increasing numbers. Caution is urged in implanting metal-backed designs until further design research is done.\r"

  ".U": "89029399\r", 
  ".W": "A specific type of failure of a metal-backed patella occurred, consisting of a separation of the polyethylene from the metal backing. This dissociation is followed by wearing of the metal backing against the femoral component. This produces clinical signs and symptoms that usually require revision. This failure occurred in 16 knees of 14 patients. Average time to failure was 14 months. Failure was associated with patellar implant design, surgical technique, patient characteristics, and femoral component design. The plastic of the metal-backed patellae was thin at the periphery. The metal plate did not extend to the edge of the plastic and acted like a sharp edge that cut the thin plastic. The plastic dome was not bonded to the plate and became separated from the plate once the plastic tore. The plate became deformed. Failure was more likely with a subluxated, tilted, or excessively thick patella or flexed femoral component. The typical patient was a large, active male who had achieved more than 115 degrees of flexion. A prominent edge on the lateral intercondylar ridge of the femoral component resulted in a concentrated load being applied to the plastic dome and favored rapid wear of the patella. Until a greater understanding of patello-femoral loading is acquired, caution in the use of metal-backed patellae is recommended.\r"

The role of the general academic pediatrician (GAP) as a consulting subspecialist also is in need of definition. We surveyed a consultation service staffed primarily by three GAPs in our tertiary care children's hospital. During the 12-month survey, 275 patients with a mean age of 5.6 years were evaluated. The mean duration of the chief complaint prior to the initial visit was 12.3 months. A total of 254 (92%) were evaluated initially as outpatients; of these, 20 (8%) were eventually hospitalized. Only 29 percent of the patients were referred to pediatric subspecialists. GAPs acting as consultants in a tertiary care setting most often see patients with long-standing complaints that do not require hospitalization or subspecialist referral, but their role at times is expanded to include more acute and more complex problems. Referrals may come from primary care physicians or from tertiary care subspecialists, particularly surgeons, or by self-referral from the patients' families.\r"

Of the nine children (69%) who qualified for a specific psychoeducational diagnosis, only three were receiving any special educational services. The failure of a previous assessment of this same group of children at our center and of other research reports to uncover a similarly high incidence of neurodevelopmental pathology may be due to the specific tests employed or to the later onset of measurable difficulties in these patients.\r"

The primarily elevated CRP levels (greater than or equal to 20 mg/l) usually increased about for a day but then decreased rapidly, provided the patient recovered uneventfully. If not, CRP remained at a high level or reincreased after transient decrease. Behaviour of CRP was not affected by the immunologic status of the patient. This property makes CRP especially useful in immunocompromised patients in whom other commonly used laboratory parameters may fail.\r"

The in vitro response of lymphocytes to T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) also was normal. The suppressor activity of JRA monocytes was essentially the same as controls. In contrast, monocytes from patients with JRA showed the following: decreased expression of receptors for Fc part of IgG immunoglobulin (FcR), diminished nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction activity, and depressed expression of Ia.7 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II determinants. This indicates that certain monocyte functions in selected patients with a variety of manifestations of JRA are depressed.\r"

Aside from a modest reduction in renal clearance, the kinetics of bumetanide in CHF were similar to those in healthy subjects. The extent of bioavailability was 81%, with a variability of 20% to 25% about the mean for both groups. The cumulative dynamic responses to bumetanide, whether administered orally or intravenously, were essentially the same in each group. Pharmacodynamic modeling showed that there were no significant differences between healthy subjects and patients with CHF in either ER50 (bumetanide urinary excretion rate producing 50% of maximum drug effect) or S (slope), although the baseline effect was 15 times lower in CHF. The maximum effect attributable to bumetanide was twofold higher in healthy subjects and there was a significant correlation between this parameter and creatinine clearance (r = 0.964; p less than 0.001). Overall, these results indicate that a predictable transition from 3 mg intravenous to oral doses of bumetanide is possible in CHF.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of hyperthyroidism on the protein binding and metabolism of prednisolone, eight subjects with hyperthyroidism were investigated before and after thyroid status returned to normal. Hyperthyroidism was associated with a reduced volume of distribution of prednisolone, a decreased systemic availability of prednisolone after oral prednisone, a displacement of the prednisolone in equilibrium with prednisone equilibrium toward prednisone, and an increased nonrenal clearance of unbound prednisolone in the presence of an impaired 6 beta-hydroxyprednisolone formation. After oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone, patients with hyperthyroidism had lower albumin-bound, transcortin-bound, and unbound concentrations of prednisolone but normal affinities of albumin and transcortin for prednisolone binding. These differences in prednisolone plasma concentrations were biologically relevant, because the capacity of these plasma samples to inhibit allogeneically stimulated lymphocytes was lower by 70% in the hyperthyroid than in the euthyroid state. Thus hyperthyroidism reduces the biologic effect of prednisolone and exhibits a differential effect on various enzymes involved in the catabolism of prednisolone.\r"

No change was seen in glomerular filtration rate, as measured by creatinine clearance, throughout the experiments. When compared with responses to piretanide challenge after placebo pretreatment, probenecid reduced by 65% the peak fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), with a corresponding reduction in diuretic excretion. Pretreatment with indomethacin reduced peak FENa by 35%, but urinary delivery of piretanide was not altered. In contrast, piroxicam did not influence FENa but significantly reduced the delivery of both sodium and piretanide into urine. We conclude that the activity of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs within the renal tubule varies among individual drugs and cannot be explained solely by their common mechanism of antiinflammatory action.\r"

Phenobarbital level/dose ratios indicated that compliance was similar with once- and twice-daily regimens, and both were better than thrice-daily dosing. Mean return tablet counts suggested that compliance was best with the once-daily regimen; both twice- and thrice-daily regimens were similarly inferior. This difference between the techniques may be explained by the inadequacies of the residual tablet count, which identified only 13% of cases identified by phenobarbital. We conclude that compliance with the once-daily regimen was best, but that compliance with a twice-daily regimen was very similar, and both were superior to dosing three times a day.\r"

Antacids reduced the aspirin-induced PDs. The mean (+/- SD) maximal PD was 27.4 +/- 1.7 mV with placebo vs. 10.7 +/- 2.2 mV with antacids (p less than 0.001). Recovery time was 65.5 +/- 5.2 minutes with placebo vs. 29.0 +/- 6.7 minutes with antacids (p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of both enantiomers of vigabatrin after a single oral dose in healthy young subjects (mean creatinine clearance 120 ml/min) were compared with kinetics in two groups of elderly subjects, one group aged 60 to 75 years (mean creatinine clearance 86 ml/min) and one group aged 76 to 97 years (mean creatinine clearance 30 ml/min). At a dose of 1500 mg, the group with the eldest subjects and the lowest creatinine clearance values showed mean increases of 3.3-fold in the time to reach the maximum concentration, 2.7-fold in the maximum concentration, and 9.8-fold in the AUC; a twofold prolongation of the t1/2; and reduced urinary excretion of the biologically and pharmacologically active S(+)-enantiomer. Changes in the intermediate group were qualitatively similar but quantitatively less. Parallel observations were made for the inactive R(-)-enantiomer. Most of these changes can be related to decreased renal clearance of vigabatrin. No interference of either enantiomer in the renal clearance of the other was noted. A nonlinear relationship between renal clearance and creatinine clearance for both enantiomers is suggested. Knowledge of the patient's renal function and an appropriate dose adjustment will minimize side effects during vigabatrin therapy, especially in elderly patients.\r"

With the ninth dose of enoxacin, 200 mg theophylline was coadministered. Blood and urine samples were assayed by sensitive and specific assays for the parent drugs and their metabolites. Significant reduction in the formation of theophylline's three major metabolites occurred on coadministration of enoxacin. At the 400 mg dose level, enoxacin caused a threefold decrease in theophylline's plasma clearance, a fourfold decrease in the urinary recovery of 3-methylxanthine and 1,3-dimethylurate, and a threefold decrease in the recovery of 1-methylurate.\r"

This family was compared with a control group. The rate of phenytoin metabolism was derived from the phenytoin/metabolite ratio in serum 6 hours after an oral test dose of 300 mg phenytoin. The propositus, a brother and a sister, were very slow metabolizers of phenytoin, with a metabolic ratio of approximately 20. In the other individuals, 22 family members of the second generation and 37 control subjects, a metabolic ratio of 4.7 +/- 2.2 (mean +/- SD; n = 59) was found. When comparing the members of the second generation (F2) with the control group, two statistically significantly different groups appear to exist: F2, with a metabolic ratio of 6.6 +/- 1.7 (mean +/- SD; n = 22), and the control group, with a metabolic ratio of 3.7 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- SD; n = 37) (p less than 0.001).

Only 1 fraction, containing 2 alkaloids, was capable of inducing delayed hypersensitivity in the animals; the sensitivity achieved, however, was weak. The substances were identified as masonin and homolycorin, which acted as elicitors, but masonin may also be a sensitizer. While homolycorin is a known daffodil constituent, masonin has not been found previously in Narcissus pseudonarcissus. 3 other alkaloids as well as chelidonic acid and isorhamnetin were non-elicitors in the sensitized guinea pigs.\r"

M up to 10% failed to irritate. Sensitization tests showed that all the guinea pigs treated with DTDM and MMBT were sensitized. Cross-sensitization tests showed that 60% of the DTDM-sensitized animals reacted to challenge with MMBT; 30% of the animals sensitized to DTDM reacted to challenge with M; 80% of the MMBT-sensitized animals reacted to challenge with MBT and 10% to challenge with M; 42% of the MBT-sensitized animals reacted to MMBT. The rank order of sensitization potential in guinea pigs observed from this study is DTDM, MMBT and then MBT. It appears that the disulfide bond, sulfur linkage and the sulfhydryl group may each play a role in the sensitizing capacity of these compounds.\r"

The reactions of representative amino acids, Cys, Lys & Gly, with morpholine, DTDM, MMBT & MBT were examined. New compounds were found between MMBT and all 3 amino acids. Additional new compounds were seen for Cys/MBT, Cys/DTDM, Lys/MBT & Gly/DTDM. No reaction was observed with morpholine. The new compounds were examined spectroscopically. Results suggest that the sensitizing nature of DTDM is probably a reaction of its disulfide bond with the -SH & -NH2 groups of amino acid moieties. The conjugation of Cys/MMBT may be via the same reaction mechanism. The -SH group of MBT may react either via oxidation and/or thioester formation with the carboxylate group of amino acids. These results also suggest that in vitro tests may predict the sensitizing potential of certain compounds.\r"

Hydrogenation of the conjugated double bonds of abietic acid decreases its susceptibility to air oxidation and would thus reduce the allergenicity of rosin. Portuguese gum rosin was therefore hydrogenated and its allergenicity was compared with that of unmodified rosin in animal experiments and by patch testing in humans. Its sensitizing potential was determined in 2 studies. No response was found according to the FCAT method while the GPMT gave significant response in the animals challenged with the highest test concentration. Hydrogenated rosin showed no eliciting activity in animals induced with unmodified rosin according to the GPMT method. A marked decrease was found in the frequency of allergic reactions to hydrogenated rosin compared to the reactions to unmodified rosin in patients with known allergy to gum rosin. We conclude that elimination of the unsaturated non-aromatic compounds by hydrogenation considerably reduces the allergenicity of Portuguese gum rosin.\r"

Furthermore, no short-term influences of UV exposure during the weekend preceding patch testing could be demonstrated. Therefore, reliable patch-test results can be expected at any season of the year from a general population, at least in Belgian-type climates.\r"

Approximately 2.5 times more patients with contact allergy to phenol-formaldehyde resins were diagnosed when routinely patch tested with P-F-R-2 in addition to PTBP-F-R. Although patch testing with a mixture of both resins was not as good as patch testing with the 2 resins separately, it was better than testing only with PTBP-F-R, since 1.6 times more patients with contact allergy to phenol-formaldehyde resins were still diagnosed. P-F-R-2 is therefore recommended for routine patch testing, preferably as a separate patch test but otherwise as a mixture with PTBP-F-R.\r"

The tests were performed on the back as follows: untreated skin, skin pre-treated with short-term occlusion and delipidized skin. Irritant reactions were induced by applying 0.5% and 2.0% SLS via Finn chamber patch tests and monitored by means of laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum water content (WC). Higher TEWL, LDV and WC were recorded for 2.0% SLS when compared to 0.5% SLS and baselines. Differences between white and hispanic skin reactivity were recorded. TEWL and WC responses showed a greater sensitivity in hispanics possibly reflecting a different modulation of the water barrier function after chemical exposure. On the other hand, the microcirculatory response, as long as detected with LDV, was similar in the 2 groups. Correlations between these data and findings observed in other races are discussed.\r"

Oral intake of ZnSO4 at both 250 micrograms/ml double-distilled deionized water (DDD) and 500 micrograms/ml DDD resulted in lower SIs than those of control guinea pigs drinking only DDD; the 250 micrograms/ml group had significantly lower SIs (p = 0.025) than controls. There was no significant correlation between intradermal test responses and the SI values of individual guinea pigs exposed to NiSO4. Mean zinc (Zn) concentrations in skin and in whole blood were not statistically different between the NiSO4 exposed control and Zn supplemented groups, nor between Ni-sensitive and non-sensitive animals within groups. The role of Zn homeostasis, role of the Langerhans cell, effect of Zn supplementation on Ni ACD in other species, and possible blocking effects of other metals should be investigated in future studies.\r"

Two sets of tests, including 12-lead electrocardiogram and a full radionuclear study, were performed in two time periods: (1) within the first 48 hours of admission; and (2) between the 12th and 15th day after admission. Comparison and correlation between the electrocardiographic data, QS waves in leads V2 and V3 and in V1 to V6 (sigma QV2-3 and sigma QV1-6), and radionuclear regional ejection fractions of the noninfarcted posterior muscle (inferior, infero-apical, and posterolateral regions and posterior index) were done. Significant linear correlations were demonstrated between the electrocardiographic variant differences in percentages (sigma QV2-3 and sigma QV1-6) and the radionuclear variant differences, especially the posterolateral and the infero-apical regions, as well as the posterior radionuclear index (r between 0.5 and 0.75; p less than 0.01). In addition, almost all of the patients who showed deepening of QS waves in the precordial leads also showed an increase in regional ejection fractions in uninvolved myocardium, and vice versa. It is concluded that the dynamic changes of the QS wave magnitude in the precordial leads within the evolution of acute anterior myocardial infarction well reflect the changes of the posterior noninfarcted muscle contraction and therefore offers a simple, inexpensive, and indirect electrocardiographic method for evaluating changes in contraction patterns of noninfarcted myocardium.\r"

Fatal hemoptysis occurred in six of eight patients with a hematologic malignancy and a fungal pneumonia. Examination of pathologic specimens from five of these patients revealed fungal invasion of blood vessels. An inflammatory response was absent in three, suggesting that granulocytes are not required for fungal-induced tissue destruction. In patients with a bronchogenic tumor, fatal hemoptysis occurred in six of seven patients with a necrotic squamous cell carcinoma. In contrast, hemoptysis was fatal in only two of ten patients with metastatic lung disease. We conclude that hemoptysis in cancer patients with a fungal pneumonia is an ominous sign that may warrant aggressive interventions to prevent a fatal complication.\r"

PMA stimulated a significant respiratory burst. Similar results were obtained with IgG IC stimulation, although the levels of H2O2 were lower. Agg IgE induced H2O2 release only by PBL and PE eosinophils and not by neutrophils. PMA stimulation resulted in detectable cytotoxic activity. IgG IC generated both PBL and PE eosinophil and PBL neutrophil cytotoxicity. Agg IgE induced significant cellular cytotoxicity in both PBL and PE eosinophils.

Bronchoalveolar lavage correctly identified five (100 percent) out of five patients, bronchial washings identified four (57 percent) of seven patients and either procedure identified nine (75 percent) of 12 patients. Bronchial brushings were positive in two (40 percent) of five patients, and transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in only four (44 percent) of nine patients. Transbronchial lung biopsy was uniquely positive in only one patient. One patient had a significant pulmonary hemorrhage following transbronchial lung biopsy, while no complications of BAL occurred. Two patients had significant coagulopathy, and one patient was severely agitated precluding transbronchial lung biopsy, and all three were positive by BAL. This study suggests that BAL should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of lymphangitic carcinomatosis before proceeding to a biopsy, especially when the risks of pneumothorax and hemorrhage are excessive.\r"

  ".W": "The use of bromocriptine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is increasing. More than 20 cases of suggested drug-induced pleuropulmonary disorders during bromocriptine therapy have been reported. We describe four male parkinsonian patients taking bromocriptine in whom pleuropulmonary abnormalities were discovered in a pulmonary hospital during a one-year period. In only one case were the roentgenographic changes reversible after withdrawal of the drug. Pleural fluid from two patients was analyzed and showed lymphocyte-predominant chronic inflammatory changes. Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein values decreased after cessation of bromocriptine. Lung function studies demonstrated volume restriction with normal or high CO transfer coefficient. The frequency of pleuropulmonary changes during bromocriptine therapy may be greater than assumed, and such patients may initially present with nonrespiratory symptoms. Follow-up of patients during bromocriptine treatment by ESR, C-reactive protein, and chest roentgenogram is recommended.\r"

With a cutoff level at 100 mg/L, the pleural fluid concentration of HA was raised in 73 percent of patients (11 of 15) with malignant mesothelioma and in 23 percent with nonmalignant inflammatory diseases, but in none with other cancer and in none with congestive heart failure. The median concentration of pleural fluid HA was significantly higher in patients with mesothelioma than in those with other cancer (p less than 0.005). Determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in pleural fluid further helped to differentiate between mesothelioma and other types of cancer; concentrations of CEA above 10 micrograms/L were found in four of 15 (27 percent) patients with mesothelioma, but in 38 percent of the patients with other cancer. We concluded that in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions associated with malignant tumors a high concentration of HA in pleural fluid combined with a low concentration of CEA suggests malignant mesothelioma as opposed to other types of cancer.\r"

The sinus node artery arose from the right coronary artery in 182 patients, from the proximal 3 cm in 179, near the origin of the acute marginal in one, and left of the crux in two. In 119 patients it arose from the left circumflex coronary artery, proximally in 87, and in 32 from anywhere throughout its length, running posteriorly as the posterior sinus node artery. Finally, eight patients had two sinus node arteries, one arising from the right coronary artery and one from the left circumflex.\r"

To analyze their differences we studied basal and postextrasystolic (post-PVC) peak-to-peak LV aortic gradients, aortic systolic pressure, and pulse pressure in 14 OCM and in 36 pure VAS without two-dimensional echocardiographic findings of OCM. Fifteen mild VAS had basal gradients similar to those of OCM (39 +/- 17 mm Hg vs 24 +/- 16 mm Hg). Patients with OCM show a post-PVC gradient (109 +/- 41 mm Hg) similar to that of VAS (110 +/- 50 mm Hg). However, the latter were departing from much higher gradients (VAS 72 +/- 30 mm Hg vs OCM 24 +/- 16 mm Hg). Decrement of post-PVC aortic systolic pressure and pulse pressure were frequent in both groups, but decrement of pulse pressure greater than 5 mm Hg were more frequent in OCM. We concluded that (1) post-PVC increased aortic gradients and decreased aortic systolic pressure occurred in both VAS and OCM; (2) post-PVC decreased aortic pulse pressure might occur in VAS; and (3) association of post-PVC gradient increment greater than 75 percent and pulse pressure decrement greater than 5 mm Hg are strongly suggestive of OCM.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the resistive, elastic, and total inspiratory muscle work and mainly the efficiency of the inspiratory muscle work in still standing and in exercising dogs. In 180 experiments with nine mongrel dogs, respiratory and circulatory functions were recorded at rest and during a 1.5-mph walk on a treadmill belt which was inclined by 9 degrees. Each dog had been trained and surgically prepared before the series of experiments started. An electronic pressure transducer together with a fluid-filled catheter was attached to the ribs at the midthoracic level. Airflow was monitored with a pneumotachygraph attached to a face mask. Aortic flow was monitored with an electromagnetic flow transducer. Catheters in the atria, the ventricles, and the pulmonary and systemic vessels were used to determine hemodynamic parameters and blood gas levels. All recorded and all derived functions were evaluated by a dedicated computer. At rest, resistive inspiratory work (0.98 kg cm) was smaller than elastic work (1.36 kg cm). Elastic work did not change with exercise but resistive work increased to 1.46 kg.cm. The increase of total work from 2.33 kg.cm at rest to 2.79 kg.cm during exercise did not reach significance. Inspiratory power increased with exercise. Estimated diaphragmatic oxygen consumption increased from 2.23 ml/min at rest to 3.64 ml/min during exercise. It was 1.6 percent of the total oxygen consumption at rest and 1.7 percent of the total oxygen consumption during exercise. The estimated efficiency of the work of inspiratory muscles was 15.8 percent at rest and 25.8 percent during exercise. These values did not vary substantially between different animals.\r"
