  ".U": "88120722\r", 
  ".W": "A randomised trial of 367 patients with acute myocardial infarction was performed to determine whether an invasive strategy combining thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rTPA), heparin, and acetylsalicylic acid, and immediate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) would be superior to a noninvasive strategy with the same medical treatment but without immediate angiography and PTCA. Intravenous infusion of 100 mg rTPA was started within 5 h after onset of symptoms (median 156 min). Angiography was performed 6-165 min later in 180 out of 183 patients allocated to the invasive strategy; 184 patients were allocated to the non-invasive strategy. Immediate PTCA reduced the percentage stenosis of the infarct-related segment, but this was offset by a high rate of transient (16%) and sustained (7%) reocclusion during the procedure and recurrent ischaemia during the first 24 h (17%). The clinical course was more favourable after non-invasive therapy, with a lower incidence of recurrent ischaemia within 24 h (3%), bleeding complications, hypotension, and ventricular fibrillation. Mortality at 14 days was lower in patients allocated to non-invasive treatment (3%) than in the group allocated to invasive treatment (7%). No difference between the treatment groups was observed in infarct size estimated from myocardial release of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase or in left ventricular ejection fraction after 10-22 days. Since immediate PTCA does not provide additional benefit there seems to be no need for immediate angiography and PTCA in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with rTPA.\r"

All patients were given heparin 5000 units before the infusion and heparin was continued, initially at 1000 units per hour, after the infusion. Minor bleeding was more frequent in the rTPA recipients, and during subsequent anticoagulant therapy there were three clinically significant bleeding episodes in this group. Patency of the infarct-related coronary artery was determined by coronary angiography about one week post-infarction, 125 angiograms being assessable. The infarct-related artery was patent in 70% of patients who received rTPA and in 41% of those who did not (p = 0.0015). In the 103 patients who had assessable contrast ventriculograms, the global ejection fractions were 57.7% and 51.7%, respectively (p = 0.04). The difference in ventricular function was largest in patients with anterior infarction (52.7% versus 40.0%, p = 0.02). The magnitude of these changes suggests an improvement in ejection fraction of 12% overall and about 30% in patients with anterior infarction.\r"

During this period, the average age on admission for long-term care rose by 0.24 years per year for women and by 0.09 years per year for men. The median length of stay also increased, more for women than for men, as did the proportion of the total lifespan spent in long-term care. Active-life expectancy became longer and terminal dependency was postponed, but the duration of terminal dependency increased. Active-life expectancy increased more rapidly in women than in men, as did the length of terminal dependency. As life expectancy continues to increase, high priority will have to be given to reduction of disability and dependency in advanced old age.\r"

A behaviour score of feeding characteristics was higher in children with cerebral palsy than in controls. Even long meal times do not compensate for the severity of these childrens' feeding impairment. The measurements of feeding efficiency provides the basis for early identification of children who cannot be adequately nourished without ancillary feeding by nasogastric tube or by enterostomy.\r"

The CO2 laser has provided a promising new approach in the management of these lesions with very low morbidity and improved control. Twenty-nine patients were treated with the CO2 laser for 38 extensive (from 1 x 1 cm to 6 x 8 cm) intraoral leukoplakic lesions, 28 for cure and one for palliation. Microscopically the lesions varied from hyperkeratosis to carcinoma in situ. Follow-up of these patients ranges from 3 to 10 years, with an average of 5 years. An initial recurrence rate of 10.8% (4/37) was observed, and a 3-year local control rate of 97% after one to two procedures. A malignant transformation rate of 2.6% was encountered. Excellent wound healing and few complications were observed with this treatment approach. Surgical technique and results are reported supporting the advantages of the CO2 laser over conventional modes of treatment in the management of oral leukoplakia.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to review a large experience at a single institution with the use of the carbon dioxide laser for treatment of congenital subglottic hemangiomas.\r"

  ".W": "Reimbursement of hospitals by Medicare under the prospective-payment system is based on patients' diagnoses as coded at discharge. During the period October 1984 through March 1985, we studied the accuracy of the coding for diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) in hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement. We used a two-stage cluster method to sample 7050 medical records from 239 hospitals that were stratified according to size. Using blinded techniques with reliability checks, medical-record specialists reabstracted the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to assign correct DRGs to discharged patients. The correct DRGs were then compared with those originally assigned by the physician and the hospital administration. The study revealed an error rate of 20.8 percent in DRG coding. Errors were distributed equally between physicians and hospitals. Small hospitals had significantly higher error rates. Previous studies had found that errors occurred randomly, so that half the errors benefited the hospital financially and half penalized the hospital. The present study found that a statistically significant 61.7 percent of coding errors favored the hospital. These errors caused the average hospital's case-mix index--a measure of the complexity of illness of the hospital's patients--to increase by 1.9 percent. As a result, hospitals received higher net reimbursement from Medicare than was supportable by the medical records. We conclude that \"creep\" does occur in the coding of DRGs, resulting in overpayment to hospitals for patients covered by Medicare.\r"

Previous studies have shown that the establishment of the pattern of en stripes depends upon the activity of the homoeobox-containing pair-rule genes fushi tarazu, ftz and even skipped, eve. Here we show that these two genes also control the spatial expression of wg. Whereas ftz and eve behave as activators of en we find that both genes are required to repress wg expression, so that wg becomes expressed only in the narrow stripes of cells which come to separate the ftz and eve bands at the end of the blastoderm stage. In contrast, we propose that the precise positioning of the en stripes depends upon signals generated in a combinatorial manner by the overlaps between the ftz or eve domains and those of other pair rule genes, specifically odd paired, opa and paired, prd.\r"

Like AA rats, patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated specific T-lymphocyte reactivity to the M. tuberculosis fraction containing the cross-reactive epitope. To characterize the critical M. tuberculosis epitope we used AA T-cell clones to screen mycobacterial antigens expressed in Escherichia coli and genetically engineered truncated proteins and synthetic peptides. The AA T-cell clones recognized an epitope formed by the amino acids at positions 180-188 in the sequence of a Mycobacterium bovis BCG antigen.

As the amino acid sequence of the human epsilon chain is now known, attempts have been made to map the Fc epsilon R1 binding site on IgE to a fragment smaller than Fc epsilon using proteolytic cleavage products, none of which proved to be active. Cleavage between the C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 domains released two inactive fragments, suggesting that the junction between these segments could be important in receptor binding. This region is protected against protease digestion in the rat IgE complex with the receptor of rat basophilic leukaemia cells. Here we report the mapping of the mast cell receptor binding site on human IgE to a sequence of 76 amino acids at the C epsilon 2/C epsilon 3 junction. Recombinant peptides containing this sequence inhibit passive sensitization of skin mast cells in vivo and sensitize mast cells to degranulation by anti-IgE in vitro almost as efficiently as a myeloma IgE. Fragments containing the separate domains are inactive. Additional sequences are required for rapid assembly of fragments into disulphide-linked dimers, suggesting that a single chain can form the active site. In a three-dimensional model of the human Fc epsilon, the two identical segments are far apart. Each folds to generate a cleft between the C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 domains on the surface of the Fc epsilon. The docking of IgE on to mast cells could take place within this cleft.\r"

A multicatalytic proteinase (MCP) of similar size and shape has been isolated from mammalian tissues. The apparent similarities of these high molecular weight complexes suggest a biochemical and functional homology between the small cytoplasmic 19S particle from Drosophila melanogaster (19S-scRNP) (ref. 7) and rat MCP (ref. 14). By means of electron microscopy, immunological techniques, RNA identification and proteinase activity assays, we were able to show that the two structurally similar complexes are immunologically related ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) with similar proteolytic activity.\r"

The severe form of the disease found in F1 mice is due, in part, to dominant NZW gene(s) mapping with the H-2 complex (the murine MHC). Here we present evidence that the tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) gene, which is located within the H-2 complex (the murine major histocompatibility complex), could be involved in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis in F1 mice. Thus, a restriction fragment length polymorphism in the TNF-alpha gene correlates with the reduced levels of TNF-alpha produced by NZW mice. Furthermore, replacement therapy with recombinant TNF-alpha induces a significant delay in the development of the nephritis.\r"

A mating scheme was used in which a set of X chromosomes was kept for 20 generations in either the active condition (known as hybrid dysgenesis) or the inactive condition (nondysgenic). Examination of 19 families of transposable elements by in situ hybridization indicated that only the P family was measurably mobilized under dysgenic conditions. Thus, P-M hybrid dysgenesis does not increase the transpositional activity of other families of transposable elements in D. melanogaster.

In family studies the poor-metabolizer phenotype behaves as an autosomal recessive trait with an incidence between 5% and 10% in the white population of Europe and North America, and extends to the deficient metabolism of more than 20 commonly prescribed drugs. Clinical studies have shown that such individuals are at high risk for the development of adverse side effects from these and probably many other drugs. Here we show that poor metabolizers have negligible amounts of the cytochrome P450 enzyme P450db1. We have cloned the human P450db1 complementary DNA and expressed it in mammalian cell culture. Furthermore, by directly cloning and sequencing cDNAs from several poor-metabolizer livers, we have identified three variant messenger RNAs that are products of mutant genes producing incorrectly spliced db1 pre-mRNA, providing a molecular explanation for one of man's most commonly defective genes (frequency of mutant alleles 35-43%).\r"

V gene selection could be random, or quite biased if the disease or the developmental status of the transformed cell somehow influenced DNA rearrangement. We have cloned and sequenced three germ-line VH gene segments that constitute a new human VH family (subgroup V) linked within 160 kilobase pairs of the DH-JH complex. One VH(V) member is rearranged in about 30% of patients with CLL and ALL, but not in IgM-expressing B-cell lines from peripheral blood. In some tumours, we detect a truncated (VH(V) RNA devoid of constant regions that originates from unrearranged VH(V) genes. In other tumours and in resting splenocytes, we detect large amounts of normally sized VH(V)-associated mRNA, although stimulation by mitogen of splenic B cells results in loss of VH(V)-hybridizing RNA. These features suggest that biased rearrangement of subgroup V may be under developmental selection.\r"

  ".W": "Several enzyme complexes drive cellular movements by coupling free energy-liberating chemical reactions to the production of mechanical work. A key goal in the study of these systems is to characterize at the molecular level mechanical events associated with individual reaction steps in the catalytic cycles of single enzyme molecules. Ideally, one would like to measure movements driven by single (or a few) enzyme molecules with sufficient temporal resolution and spatial precision that these events can be directly observed. Kinesin, a force-generating ATPase involved in microtubule-based intracellular organelle transport, will drive the unidirectional movement of microscopic plastic beads along microtubules in vitro. Under certain conditions, a few (less than or equal to 10) kinesin molecules may be sufficient to drive either bead movement or organelle transport. Here we describe a method for determining precise positional information from light-microscope images. The method is applied to measure kinesin-driven bead movements in vitro with a precision of 1-2 nm. Our measurements reveal basic mechanical features of kinesin-driven movements along the microtubule lattice, and place significant constraints on possible molecular mechanisms of movement.\r"

The sequence of the 56 amino acids at the N-terminal of the protein deduced from this insert is highly homologous to the basic trypsin inhibitor family, and the lysate from COS-1 cells transfected with the longer APP cDNA showed an increased inhibition of trypsin activity. Partial sequencing of the genomic DNA encoding APP showed that the 225 nucleotides are located in two exons. At least three messenger RNA species, apparently transcribed from a single APP gene by alternative splicing, were found in human brain. We suggest that protease inhibition by the longer APP(s) could be related to aberrant APP catabolism.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes recognize foreign molecules using the T-cell receptor (TCR), a disulphide-linked heterodimer closely associated with the CD3 polypeptide complex on the cell surface. The TCR alpha beta heterodimers seem largely responsible for the recognition properties of both helper (TH) and cytotoxic (TC) T cells. Recently, a second CD3-associated T-cell receptor heterodimer, gamma delta, has been described. Cells bearing the gamma delta receptor appear before those bearing alpha beta during thymic ontogeny and persist as a minor component (1-10%) of mature peripheral T cells. Their function is unknown. As there are a limited number of functional TCR V gamma gene segments, the size and potential diversity of the V delta repertoire is important for the number of different antigens that may be recognized by gamma delta heterodimers. The delta-chain locus is located 75 kilobases (kb) 5' to the TCR C alpha coding region, raising the possibility that the alpha and delta V-region repertoires may overlap. Also, analysis of rearrangements at the delta-chain locus in developing thymocytes shows distinct fetal and adult patterns indicating that there may be differences between the fetal and adult V delta repertoires. To address these questions, we have characterized a large number of delta-containing complementary DNA clones from adult double-negative thymocytes (CD4-8-), an immature population that is enriched for gamma delta-bearing cells. We find that a limited number of V delta sequences are used, showing little overlap with known adult V alpha s and differing significantly from fetal V delta s. But as two D elements may participate simultaneously in V delta gene assembly, and random nucleotides may be added at any one of three junctional points, the potential number of different delta chains that can be made in the adult thymus is very large (approximately 10(13)).\r"

Qualitative histochemical demonstration of cytochrome c oxidase showed a mosaic of fibers without detectable cytochrome c oxidase activity. Quantitative single fiber measurements in the patients' biopsies showed that the majority of the muscle fibers had decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity without selective involvement of a specific fiber type. Succinate dehydrogenase was measured and the ratio of the activities (succinate dehydrogenase/cytochrome c oxidase) was calculated. Normal muscle showed a ratio of about 2, whereas diseased muscle showed values between 10 and 20, due to a decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity. Ragged-red fibers showed very low or undetectable cytochrome c oxidase activity.\r"

The temporal bones were harvested, fixed in glutaraldehyde, and decalcified in 10% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). After 7 days of decalcification, the cochleas were dissected and incubated with a diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution. Sections with stained vessels were projected onto the digitizing plate with the help of the camera lucida. The computer was used to calculate tissue area, vessel length, and vessel surface area. A statistically significant increase (p less than 0.05) in both the tissue area to vessel length ratio and the tissue area to vessel surface area ratio was demonstrated in the SHR and the aged SHR groups when compared to the WKY in the stria vascularis. No statistically significant difference was found between the two SHR groups.

Facial paralysis was noted on presentation in 23% of the cases and regional neck node metastases were noted in 13%. Both findings correlated with prognosis. Seventy patients underwent surgery alone and 30 patients received combined therapy. The remaining patients were excluded from the study. The overall 5-year survival rate was 50%, with a 44% risk of recurrence. Fifty-six percent of the patients whose conditions subsequently recurred had their facial nerves sacrificed at time of surgery. Selected patients who received combined therapy experienced better local regional control and a prolonged disease-free interval as compared with those who underwent surgery alone. Combined therapy, however, provided no survival benefit for this group of patients. Adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended in the treatment planning of selected malignant tumors of the parotid gland.\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is an uncommon, histologically benign vascular tumor that occurs almost exclusively in adolescent males. While occasional mention is made of the occurrence of JNA in females and in older males, only four cases have withstood rigorous clinicopathological review. This neoplasm accounts for less than 0.05% of all benign lesions that originate in the nasopharynx. Its clinically malignant behavior is a result of its propensity for locally destructive growth and fatal hemorrhage. The evolution in the management of these tumors has been the subject of much interest and much confusion. The advents of computed tomographic (CT) scanning, selective angiography with embolization, and refinements in surgical approaches have revolutionized operative management of these lesions by allowing more realistic selection of surgical candidates, better preoperative planning, and more flexible (yet aggressive) primary surgical treatment. The attendant reduction in morbidity and mortality of contemporary surgical management of this disease has largely obviated the argument of those who advocate use of radiotherapy as the primary treatment modality for this benign lesion. This latter view is based on the reports of massive hemorrhage, significant incidence of incomplete removal, and mortality reported in the older surgical literature. This article details our experience with a series of 31 patients who had clinicopathological diagnoses of JNA and were treated between 1954 and 1984. It furthermore represents an update of our previously reported series.\r"

The use of evoked facial EMG activity was classified and described. Direct local mechanical (surgical) stimulation and direct electrical stimulation were of benefit in the localization and/or delineation of the facial nerve contour. Burst and train acoustic patterns of EMG activity appeared to indicate surgical trauma to the facial nerve that would not have been appreciated otherwise. Early results of postoperative facial function of monitored patients are presented, and the possible value of burst and train acoustic EMG activity patterns in the intraoperative assessment of facial nerve function is discussed. Acoustic facial EMG monitoring appears to provide a potentially powerful surgical tool for delineation of the facial nerve contour, the ongoing use of which may lead to continued improvement in facial nerve function preservation through modification of dissection strategy.\r"

Twenty-five subjects received oral acyclovir daily for one year, while 19 received the drug only during outbreaks of herpes. The number of patients who experienced recurrences of aphthous stomatitis and the frequency and duration of attacks per patient were not significantly different between groups. Furthermore, no consistent change in attack rate was observed in members of either group compared to that reported before they had entered the trial.

On the basis of clinical observations of patients treated perioperatively with dantrolene sodium for malignant hyperthermia, we hypothesized that pharyngeal muscle spasms are a major factor in tonsillectomy pain. We entered 113 patients, 11 years of age and older, into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of dantrolene sodium in reduction of tonsillectomy pain. Patients were randomly assigned either dantrolene (1.5 mg/kg per day) or placebo orally four times a day for 5 days postoperatively. On a standardized questionnaire, the patient recorded pain, diet, activity level, analgesics, and side effects, daily for 2 weeks. Also, alkaline phosphatase (alk phos) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) levels were determined before the operation and 2 weeks after. Patients who received dantrolene had no significant differences in subjective pain, diet, or activity level scores from those of patients who received placebo. Dantrolene patients did, however, require significantly less analgesic use than placebo patients (p = 0.034, 0.015, and 0.005 for postoperative days 2, 3, and 4, respectively). There was no significant difference in side effects or changes in liver enzyme between the dantrolene and placebo groups. We conclude that dantrolene sodium, given in the dosage noted, is effective in reduction of analgesic requirements after tonsillectomy.\r"

Multiple techniques exist for the reinnervation of muscles that have injured motor nerves. Reinnervation of denervated trapezius muscles was examined in the New Zealand white rabbit by use of three techniques of reinnervation: (1) neuromuscular pedicle transfer of the accessory nerve from the trapezius muscle, (2) direct accessory nerve implantation, and (3) neuromuscular pedicle transfer of the accessory nerve from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The reinnervated trapezius muscles were examined grossly by direct nerve stimulation, electrophysiologically by evoked electromyography, and histologically by enzymatic muscle staining and silver-reducing nerve staining. The gross, electrophysiologic, and histologic results confirmed successful reinnervation of the trapezius muscle within 6 weeks of operation. No significant difference was observed between the various techniques of reinnervation.\r"

However, even in well-compensated patients, the initial symptoms may reappear--under certain conditions that are briefly discussed (decompensation)--and, in addition, vestibular gaze stabilization deficits, (apparently permanent) appear whenever moderately rapid head movements are imposed. Thus, surgical ablation of unilateral peripheral vestibular function should not be considered \"a treatment of choice,\" and should be performed in only carefully selected cases.\r"

Conventional methods include standard radiographic views, plain tomography, photography, and computerized tomography. All of these methods produce a two-dimensional image of the patient. Three-dimensional computerized tomographic reconstruction allows the surgeon to visualize the entire facial skeletal deformity. The three-dimensional image produced also allows comparison of the deformity to surrounding normal structures, and thus makes the correction of facial asymmetrics more precise. This new modality is particularly useful in the preoperative planning for patients with zygomaticomaxillary defects that result from either trauma or maxillectomy. Illustrative examples of patients in whom autogenous bone graft zygomaticomaxillary reconstruction was performed, after trauma and subsequent to subtotal maxillectomy, are presented. The amount and exact placement of the grafts was determined preoperatively from the analysis of the three-dimensional CT reconstruction, and the surgical planning was thereby simplified.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive resection of carcinoma that involves the tongue base and supraglottic larynx is accompanied by significant potential morbidity and mortality. This is often indicated by poor rates of cure and the limited palliation afforded by radiotherapy alone. Removal of a significant portion of the posterior tongue frequently results in intractable aspiration. Techniques in reconstruction of the oropharyngeal defect and tongue base have included primary closure, random flaps, and myocutaneous flaps. Each of these techniques has been successful, to some degree, in resurfacing pharyngeal defects. However, the functional results in regard to deglutition are less than satisfactory as a result of aspiration. Frequently, simultaneous or delayed total laryngectomy is performed to deal with the pulmonary complications. Various types of laryngoplasty do not uniformly correct the problems of aspiration and deglutition associated with subtotal glossectomy. Our experience includes eight patients who had advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base, vallecula, and the supraglottic larynx. All patients underwent partial or subtotal glossectomy and laryngectomy. The mucosal defect was reconstructed with pectoralis myocutaneous flap. In order to reestablish voice, a primary tracheopharyngeal shunt was created with the use of a portion of cricoid and upper trachea. The majority of these patients have had successful rehabilitation of deglutition, mastication, and speech.\r"

In the latter instance, enlarged conchal bones may be removed by the technique of turbinate submucous resection, while diffuse stromal hypertrophy necessitates partial resection of the inferior turbinates. A number of techniques of inferior turbinate surgery have been described. I have used the procedure of \"inferior turbinoplasty\" with increasing frequency for more than 9 years. Three to five years after such surgery, a detailed followup of 40 patients revealed none of the once-feared sequelae of turbinate resection, such as bleeding, crusting, foul nasal discharge, or bothersome postnasal drainage. Histologic examination of turbinates almost 5 years after turbinoplasty revealed fibrosis and scarring, with a marked decrease in mucous gland population, and normal mucosa. To obtain the best possible functional result inferior turbinate surgery is a necessary adjunct to most septal surgery. If conservatively done, it does not impair normal turbinate function. It must be stressed, however, that if the underlying cause of the turbinate hypertrophy is not addressed, recurrent obstruction can and probably will occur.\r"

Of these, 11 patients whose superficial lesions were suitably located received radium implants, and the other 21 patients were treated with a combination of electron beam and 60Co. The implant doses ranged from 60 to 75 Gy and the external beam doses ranged from 55 to 70 Gy. In 12 patients, the submandibular and subdigastric nodes were electively treated with 60Co with doses of 45 to 50 Gy, and in 12 patients the strip of skin between the nose and the free border of the mandible was also electively irradiated. None of the 11 patients treated by interstitial implant experienced treatment failure. In the 21 patients treated by external beam, one patient had primary tumor recurrence and four patients failed in the unirradiated neck. A metastasis developed in the unrradiated tissues between the nose and the neck on the only patient who died of the disease. Necrosis of the anterior art of the upper jaw of one patient developed as a result of a hot spot. Today, when treatment is calculated with the help of a computer program and special techniques to optimize tumor dose, hot spots can be prevented.\r"

Accurate measurement of the VOR is therefore an important clinical method for evaluation of the vestibular system. We applied a new method of computerized vestibular testing, the Vestibular Autorotation Test (VAT), which is based on 18 seconds of active head movements. The VAT was used to prospectively study the horizontal VOR of nine patients with cancer who were being treated with cisplatin. Patients were instructed to move their heads in the horizontal plane in synchrony with audible clicks of a linearly increasing frequency range, from 0.5 to 6.5 Hz. Electro-oculographic (EOG) eye movements and head velocity were monitored and digitized to compute horizontal VOR gain and phase from 2 to 6 Hz. Patients were tested with the VAT before the initial cisplatin treatment, and then before each subsequent cisplatin treatment. The pretreatment gains and phases were compared with those obtained after the final cisplatin treatment. Results showed decreased VOR gains at 3.1 Hz, 3.9 Hz, and 5.1 Hz, and increased phase lags at 3.1 Hz and 3.9 Hz. We conclude that VAT analysis of the horizontal VOR at frequencies 3 to 5 Hz is useful for detection and monitoring of cisplatin vestibulotoxicity.\r"

Six of these were found to have active, free-flowing fistulas at the time of exploration.

This was particularly true for the older children (greater than or equal to 6 years). Home total parenteral nutrition onset and duration were unrelated to outcome. Medical complications, unrelated to home total parenteral nutrition, requiring lengthy and frequent hospitalizations were highly related to nonverbal intelligence and to perceptual-motor functioning.

  ".W": "To determine whether hepatitis B virus (HBV) regulates the expression of the human beta-interferon gene, a series of recombinant bovine papilloma virus plasmids containing the human interferon gene and various fragments of the HBV genome were constructed and used to transform C127 cells, a murine fibroblast line. Analysis of the DNA from transformed C127 cells indicated that the interferon gene was intact and that the plasmids replicated as stable multicopy elements. The 1828-base-pair BamHI HBV DNA fragment containing the core antigen gene, but not the 2755-base-pair Bgl II HBV DNA fragment encoding both the surface antigen and the X antigen, suppressed the production of human beta-interferon. No effect by any of the recombinant plasmids on the synthesis of murine interferon was detected. The suppression of human beta-interferon by HBV occurs via a trans-acting factor. A frameshift mutation within the HBV core gene alleviates the inhibitory activity; thus we infer that the core protein is this factor or is crucially associated with this activity.\r"

Using A1 (alpha), A2 (alpha+), and A3 (alpha III) Na+,K+-ATPase gene probes, we have analyzed the distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase mRNAs in adult and fetal rat tissues by RNA blot and hybridization histochemistry. A1 Na+,K+-ATPase mRNA was found ubiquitously among various tissues, with highest levels in transport epithelial and neural tissues. A2 mRNA was found in adult neural and muscle tissues, and A3 mRNA was found only in neural tissues and fetal heart muscle. Both A1 and A2 mRNAs were less abundant in fetal brain than in adult brain; in contrast, A3 mRNA was abundant at both stages. In situ mapping of brain areas that contain A3 mRNA suggests that this Na+,K+-ATPase isoenzyme is expressed predominantly by neural cells. Analysis of Na+,K+-ATPase proteins generated by cell-free translation of synthetic mRNAs suggests that the A3 protein has properties similar to A2 (alpha+).\r"

To elucidate possible mechanisms of selection underlying these distributions, large collections of the species were made from five Australasian localities spanning 24 degrees of latitude. Two replicate experimental populations were established from each collection, and each replicate was then released into an enclosure surrounding a natural habitat at a central-latitude locality. Genotype frequencies at the four loci were monitored for 15 months, covering 12 discrete generations, and selection coefficients on each polymorphism were then estimated by maximum likelihood procedures. For Est6 no coefficients were found to be significantly different from zero. For Pgm some nonzero coefficients were estimated, but these were heterogeneous across experimental populations of different geographic origins. For both Adh and Gpdh, nonzero selection coefficients were estimated that were homogeneous across populations and indicated heterozygote advantage. Predicted Adh and Gpdh equilibrium allele frequencies were consistent with those found in adjacent free-living populations. It is concluded that, at such intermediate latitudes at least, selection operates on the Adh and Gpdh polymorphisms to the advantage of heterozygotes.\r"

In vivo, both CO dehydrogenase activity and hydrogenase activity increased several hundred fold upon addition of 2 microM NiCl2. Apo-CO dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity and differed from holo-CO dehydrogenase only in its activity and Ni content, containing less than 0.2 mol of Ni per mol of protein, and a specific activity of 35 mumol of CO per min per mg. Optimal in vitro activation of purified apo-CO dehydrogenase resulted in an enzyme with a specific activity of 2640 mumol of CO per min per mg. No additional enzymes or low molecular weight cofactors were required for activation. Apo-CO dehydrogenase was not activated by MgCl2, MnCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, CoCl2, or Na2MoO4. 63Ni was incorporated into apo-CO dehydrogenase during activation.

The deduced primary translation product of 587 amino acids has a putative signal peptide, nine potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, and marked sequence similarity of the first two-thirds of the protein with pepsin-like proteases. Barrier activity was abolished by in vitro mutation of an aspartic acid predicted from this sequence homology to be in the active site. Therefore, barrier protein is probably a protease that cleaves alpha factor. The sequence similarity suggests that the first two-thirds of the barrier protein is organized into two distinct structural domains like those of the pepsin-like proteases. However, the BAR1 gene product has a third carboxyl-terminal domain of unknown function; deletion of at least 166 of the 191 amino acids of this region has no significant effect on barrier activity.\r"

The stimulation resulted from activation of the initial step of methanogenesis, the production of formylmethanofuran from methanofuran and CO2. These results establish a role for this heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-HTP) in the reduction of CO2 to formylmethanofuran. Evidence indicates that CoM-S-S-HTP is the labile intermediate that accounts for the coupling of the reduction of 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid by the methylreductase to formylmethanofuran biosynthesis, the \"RPG effect.\" The heterodisulfide was found to be labile in cell extracts due to enzyme-catalyzed reduction and possibly thioldisulfide exchange.\r"

Cardiac myosins undergo an adult-to-fetal isoform transition in various models of hypertrophy. Using gene-specific cDNA probes, we show here that in the adult myocardium the mRNAs encoding the fetal (skeletal muscle type) isoforms of alpha-actin and sarcomeric tropomyosin are re-expressed within 2 days in response to pressure overload. In addition, atrial natriuretic factor mRNA, so far believed to be expressed primarily in the atria, was readily detectable in the ventricles of neonates and was induced to markedly high levels in pressure-overloaded adult ventricles. In contrast, cardiac hypertrophy produced by thyroid hormone excess was not associated with induction of the atrial natriuretic factor gene or fetal contractile protein isogenes. Furthermore, the c-fos and c-myc protooncogenes and a major heat shock protein gene (hsp70) are induced in the ventricular myocardium within 1 hr after imposition of pressure overload. These results suggest that induction of cellular protooncogenes and heat shock (stress) protein genes is an early response to pressure overload, whereas reinduction of the genes normally expressed only in perinatal life, such as fetal isoforms of contractile proteins and atrial natriuretic factor, is a later event. These two types of responses might represent the general pattern of growth induction to work overload by terminally differentiated cells that have lost the ability to undergo DNA replication.\r"

The reaction center core of this photosystem, where photochemistry occurs, is a heterodimer of homologous polypeptides called D1 and D2. Besides chlorophyll and quinone, photosystem II contains other organic cofactors, including two known as Z and D. Z transfers electrons from the site of water oxidation to the oxidized reaction center primary donor, P+.680, while D+. gives rise to the dark-stable EPR spectrum known as signal II. D+. has recently been shown to be a tyrosine radical. Z is probably a second tyrosine located in a similar environment. Indirect evidence indicates that Z and D are associated with the D1 and D2 polypeptides, respectively. To identify the specific tyrosine residue corresponding to D, we have changed Tyr-160 of the D2 polypeptide to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis of a psbD gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. The resulting mutant grows photosynthetically, but it lacks the EPR signal of D+.. We conclude that D is Tyr-160 of the D2 polypeptide. We suggest that the C2 symmetry in photosystem II extends beyond P680 to its immediate electron donor and conclude that Z is Tyr-161 of the D1 polypeptide.\r"

  ".W": "Members of the family of transmembrane integral membrane proteins called integrins have been implicated in forming attachments to actin microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. These attachments are thought to involve one or more intervening peripheral membrane proteins linked to integrin. To detect such possible linkages in vivo, the integrin molecules on the surfaces of intact chicken peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected into caps by cross-linking with specific antibodies, and the capped cells were examined by double immunofluorescence to determine whether particular cytoskeletal proteins were co-collected with the integrin. With resting lymphocytes, the capping of integrin did not result in any detectable redistribution of either talin, vinculin, or alpha-actinin inside the cells. However, if the capping was carried out upon the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to the cells, then talin, but not vinculin or alpha-actinin, was found associated with the integrin caps. PMA is known to activate protein kinase C. These results suggest that after, but not before, PMA stimulation of intact cells, talin becomes linked either directly or indirectly with integrin, reflecting the formation of a membrane-cytoskeletal association that is metabolically regulated.\r"

To discover the molecular mechanism that causes alpha Gs deficiency in these patients, we examined eight kindreds with one or more members affected with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy or pseudohypoparathyroidism and alpha Gs deficiency. In these families, alpha Gs deficiency and the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype were transmitted together in a dominant inheritance pattern. Using a cDNA hybridization probe for alpha Gs, restriction analysis with several endonucleases showed no abnormalities of restriction fragments or gene dosage. RNA blot and dot blot analysis of total RNA from cultured fibroblasts obtained from the patients revealed approximately equal to 50% reduced mRNA levels for alpha Gs in affected members of six of the pedigrees but normal levels in affected members of the two other pedigrees, compared to mRNA levels in fibroblasts from unaffected individuals. By contrast, mRNA levels encoding the alpha subunit of the G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase were not altered. Our findings suggest that several molecular mechanisms produce alpha Gs deficiency in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia and that major gene rearrangements or deletions are not a common cause for alpha Gs deficiency in pseudohypoparathyroidism type I.\r"

The 13-amino acid NH2-terminal region of Cai was substituted by polypeptides from beta-galactosidase or from colicin A. Upon induction of the chimeric proteins, the rate of expression of the immunity protein could be correlated to the level of resistance to colicin A. The immunity protein has been \"tagged\" with an epitope from the colicin A protein for which a monoclonal antibody is available. Using this technique, we have directly demonstrated that the immunity protein is located in the cytoplasmic membrane.

The injected oocytes responded to the hormones by demonstrating oscillations in membrane currents as recorded by the voltage-clamp method. The response was dependent on the hormone concentrations and detectable between 5 and 1000 nM concentrations. Size fractionation of poly(A)+ RNA from the respective tissues showed that the mRNAs encoding the three hormone receptors were larger than 18S rRNA, suggesting a length of at least 2 kilobases. When vasopressin was added to the oocyte bath, an inward membrane current was generated in oocytes injected with rat poly(A)+ RNA from liver but not from kidney. This suggests that the V1-type (liver), not the V2-type (kidney), vasopressin receptor can be expressed and electrophysiologically identified in the oocyte. A V1-specific, but not a V2-specific, antagonist suppressed the vasopressin-dependent effect. Application of angiotensin II to liver poly(A)+ RNA-injected oocytes elicited oscillations in membrane current, indicating that these oocytes also expressed receptors for angiotension II; the antagonist [Sar1, O-methionyl-Tyr4]angiotensin II blocked this effect. Poly(A)+ RNA from tumor-derived GH3B6 cells, known to contain receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone, injected into oocytes induced receptors responding to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; the drug chlordiazepoxide suppressed the thyrotropin-releasing hormone response.\r"

The topological changes in a supercoiled DNA substrate generated by the two purified proteins were analyzed. More than 99% of the inversion products were unknotted rings. This result excludes synapsis by way of a random collision of recombination sites, because the resulting entrapped supercoils would be converted into knots by recombination. Instead, the recombination sites must come together in the synaptic complex in an ordered fashion with a fixed number of supercoils between the sites. The linking number of the substrate DNA increases by four during recombination. Thus, in three successive rounds of inversion, the change in linking number was +4, +8, and +12, respectively. These results lead to a quantitative model for the mechanism of Gin recombination that includes the distribution of supercoils in the synaptic complex, their alteration by strand exchange, and specific roles for the two proteins needed for recombination.\r"

The 38-kDa phosphoprotein was identified as synaptophysin (p38), a well-characterized integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. The three other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins distributed in the same manner as synaptophysin in all subcellular fractions. Like synaptophysin, the two high molecular weight phosphotyrosine proteins (105 and 94 kDa) were found to be glycoproteins by lectin chromatography. Tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptophysin was an intravesicular reaction and reached 50% of maximal level within 3 min. Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent, inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous protein substrates but not the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, poly(Glu80,-Tyr20). Tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptophysin was also demonstrated in synaptosomes, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle proteins occurs in intact nerve terminals.\r"

Transformed immunoglobulin-negative precursors either maintained their immunoglobulin genes in the germ-line configuration or had undergone DJ or abortive VDJ rearrangements (V, D, and J represent variable, diversity, and joining gene segments). All cell lines and their derivative clones, even those with no detectable immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, generated subpopulations of cells that produced high levels of joining (J) chain when analyzed by immunoprecipitation after biosynthetic labeling and by blot hybridization of cytoplasmic RNA. Morphologic and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that J-chain production was confined to clonal progeny that had exited the cell cycle to undergo plasma-cell differentiation. Analysis of cell surface antigens revealed expression of several B-cell maturational markers, including complement receptor type 2 (CR2) and plasma cell antigen 1 (PCA-1). Epstein-Barr virus can thus transform B-cell progenitors, allowing them to proliferate and undergo terminal B-cell differentiation coupled with J-chain expression. These events appear to occur independently of the immunoglobulin gene status of the transformed cells.\r"

The LH-RH receptors showed a low-binding affinity (Kd = 54 nM) and high capacity (Bmax = 12.0 pmol/mg). Treatment with the [D-Trp6]LH-RH decreased the binding affinity (Kd = 0.52 microM). Specific somatostatin receptors, with Kd = 1.3 nM and Bmax = 543 fmol/mg, were also found. Treatment with [D-Trp6]LH-RH lowered Bmax to 44 fmol/mg, and administration of RC-160 reduced Kd to 30 nM. After the combined treatment with the two analogs, Kd and Bmax were decreased. Specific PRL receptors (Kd = 0.72 nM; Bmax = 161 fmol/mg) were also detected. Treatment with either analog reduced Bmax by 50%, but a much greater reduction of PRL binding capacity was revealed after in vitro dissociation of the bound endogenous PRL by MgCl2. The dramatic fall in the total number of PRL receptors after combination treatment with both analogs could be partially responsible for the decrease in the weight and volume of prostate tumors. The findings support the concept that analogs of LH-RH and somatostatin can inhibit tumors directly through their own respective receptors. One of several mechanisms of the antineoplastic activity of these analogs could be the elimination of tumor growth-promoting effect of PRL by the reduction of the total number of PRL receptors.\r"

These constructs were inserted into M13 replicative form viral DNA, and the DNA from progeny virus generated by transfection of Escherichia coli was examined by sequence analysis at the site of oligomer insertion. With nonalkylated constructs, and with constructs containing only one BP adduct, no sequence alterations were found in progeny viral DNAs. With constructs containing two BP adducts, one in each strand and closely spaced, some progeny DNAs showed the original oligomer sequence, whereas others exhibited large deletions and illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination, both of which removed the damaged construct. Increasing the distance between BP adducts in the construct reduced the frequency of recombinant events. These sequence alterations occurred in both recA+ and recA- host cells. We speculate that the closely spaced adducts in opposite construct strands cause a rare distortion in DNA structure, which activates the recombinant machinery, and that mutagenic and carcinogenic agents other than polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may cause similar DNA distortions, which induce illegitimate recombination.\r"

As reported previously for a purified porin from Escherichia coli, voltage gating of conductance was found to be induced in a lipid bilayer by the solubilized purified porin, protein I, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The unitary response to an applied potential showed a cascade of current from an initial level through at least three levels, more or less equal, to a persisting lower level. The initial level of current corresponded to 1.0-1.3 nS for 0.2 M NaCl on either side of the bilayer. Briefly reducing the potential to zero restored the current to its initial level. Interpretation of the unitary response is suggested by electron microscopic data obtained on negatively stained outer membranes of E. coli indicating the presence of \"pores\" appearing in triplets. Moreover, low-resolution x-ray and neutron diffraction studies on crystals obtained with an E. coli porin show that three polypeptides associate to form a unit. Combining such structural data with the present electrical data lends support for the hypothesis that the unitary response results from three pores acting as a unit in response to an applied potential. Evidence obtained with the patch-clamp technique is mounting for a similar mechanism of many channels operating as a unit in a variety of cell membranes. The porin channel holds promise as a concrete model for the analysis of voltage gating of ionic conductance.\r"

Approximately 40% of the inducible clones detected by this procedure corresponded to either cytoskeletal beta- or gamma-actin genes. One nonactin clone, designated c99, was found to be derived from an 8.5-kilobase RNA whose abundance began to increase as early as 30 min after stimulation. DNA sequencing established the identity of this RNA as fibronectin. Several additional mitogens were then tested and found to efficiently induce fibronectin mRNA. These included fetal calf serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor type beta. For at least one inducer, fetal calf serum, the increase in mRNA was preceded by an increase in fibronectin gene transcription. This increase was rapid, reaching maximal levels within 10 min, and was accompanied by near-coordinate increases in both c-fos and beta-actin transcription. These results indicate that fibronectin is a member of a class of \"early-response\" genes, typified by c-fos and including beta-actin, whose rapid expression may be important in mediating cellular responses to peptide growth factors.\r"

Inducer strains contain several copies of the complete 5.4-kilobase (kb) I factor at various sites on the chromosomal arms; reactive strains contain no complete I factor. Incomplete and defective I elements occur at constant locations in pericentromeric heterochromatin of both types of strains. The 5.4-kb I factors transpose, whereas incomplete I elements do not transpose. The constant location of defective I elements in all strains indicates that they were in the genome before the spread of D. melanogaster throughout the world. Sequences homologous to I occur in other Drosophila species, and their distribution correlates with the phylogenetic relationships between species. We have studied the organization of I homologues in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila teissieri. These species seem to contain both transposable I elements, even though their structure may differ from that of the 5.4-kb I factors of the inducer strains of D. melanogaster, and nontransposable I elements, which are always at the same place in the genome when different stocks of the same species are compared.

None of the Cbx alleles studied shows variations in phenotype with extra doses of the Ubx gene. Only Cbx2 and CbxIRM (a revertant of Cbx1) show synapsis-dependent gene expression (\"transvection\"). The mesothoracic phenotypes of CbxIRM and Cbx2 heterozygotes are strongly modified when the homologous chromosome carries breakpoints proximal to or at the Ubx locus or null alleles of this gene. These lesions in the homologous chromosome enhance the Cbx2 mutant phenotype and reduce that of CbxIRM one.

  ".W": "Alterations in gene expression that orchestrate eukaryotic cellular differentiation often require appropriate interactions between differentiating cells and a specialized microenvironment. During T-lymphocyte differentiation, immature thymocytes undergo a stringent intrathymic selection process that requires intimate contact with thymic stromal elements. Since this selection process generates T cells that are self-tolerant and recognize nominal antigen only within the context of self-major histocompatibility antigen complex molecules, it is possible that thymocyte/stromal cell interactions are mediated, in part, by antigen-specific receptors expressed on differentiating thymocytes. However, the developmental stage at which alpha/beta antigen-specific receptors are expressed during T-cell maturation has been a matter of debate. To address this issue, we have studied alpha/beta T-cell antigen receptor gene and protein expression on normal thymocyte subsets of AKR/J mice, as well as on a panel of AKR/J primary thymic lymphomas characterized for CD4 (L3T4) and CD8 (Lyt-2) differentiation antigen expression. The data unequivocally demonstrate that alpha/beta heterodimers are expressed not only on phenotypically mature thymocytes but also on the majority of CD4+8+ double-positive cells that comprise the predominant nonmature thymocyte subset. Furthermore, a fraction of thymocytes in the CD4-8- double-negative compartment, known to contain progenitor cells, also expresses readily detectable cell-surface alpha/beta receptors. Therefore, during the process of intrathymic selection, interactions between nonmature thymocytes and stromal cells via the antigen-receptor complex may play a pivotal role in T-cell differentiation and should be considered in formulating schemes for functional T-cell selection.\r"

  ".W": "Synovial membranes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as other types of chronic destructive inflammatory arthritis contain infiltrates of activated T lymphocytes that probably contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In an effort to elucidate the nature of these infiltrates, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-responsive T lymphocytes were grown out of synovial fragments from 14 patients undergoing surgery for advanced destructive inflammatory joint disease. Eleven of the samples examined were from patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis, while three others were obtained from individuals with clinical osteoarthritis. Southern blot analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain genes in 13 of 14 cultures showed distinct rearrangements, indicating that each culture was characterized by the predominance of a limited number of clones. T-cell populations from peripheral blood stimulated with a variety of activators and expanded with IL-2 did not demonstrate evidence of similar clonality in long-term culture. These results suggest that a limited number of activated T-cell clones predominate at the site of tissue injury in rheumatoid synovial membranes as well as in other types of destructive inflammatory joint disease. Further characterization of these T-cell clones may aid our understanding of the pathogenesis of these rheumatic disorders.\r"

  ".U": "88125011\r", 
  ".W": "We previously have assigned N-terminal specificity to three hamster monoclonal antibodies (mAbs I, II, and III) produced to mouse recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), based on the ability of the N-terminal peptide IFN-gamma-(1-39) to block binding of 125I-labeled IFN-gamma (125I-IFN-gamma) and on the ability of these antibodies to bind 125I-IFN-gamma-(1-39). Only mAb I blocked function and binding to the IFN-gamma receptor, suggesting that it may bind to a region of the molecule involved in interaction with the receptor. To further define the epitope specificities of the antibodies, a series of N-terminal peptides were synthesized and tested for their ability to block antibody binding of 125I-IFN-gamma. Peptides IFN-gamma-(1-39), IFN-gamma-(1-20), IFN-gamma-(3-20), and IFN-gamma-(5-20) inhibited binding of 125I-IFN-gamma by mAb I in order of decreasing effectiveness, while peptide IFN-gamma-(7-20) was without effect. Peptides IFN-gamma-(1-39), IFN-gamma-(1-20), and IFN-gamma-(3-20) also inhibited binding of 125I-IFN-gamma by mAb II but were less effective when compared with their inhibition of mAb I. IFN-gamma-(5-20) and IFN-gamma-(7-20) did not inhibit binding by mAb II. Peptides IFN-gamma-(1-10), IFN-gamma-(10-30), and IFN-gamma-(21-44) did not inhibit either mAb I or mAb II. While IFN-gamma-(1-39) and IFN-gamma-(10-30) inhibited binding by mAb III, neither IFN-gamma-(1-20) nor any of its truncated forms were inhibitory. All three antibodies had similar Kd values for 125I-IFN-gamma. A prediction of the secondary structure of the molecule and the peptide inhibition data suggest that the epitope (possible receptor binding region) for mAb I involves a loop in the area containing residues 12-20, with sequences N-terminal to these residues possibly stabilizing the loop conformation. Direct evidence that the N-terminal 1-39 region of IFN-gamma is important in receptor binding was the observation that IFN-gamma-(1-39), but not the C-terminal IFN-gamma-(95-133), competed with 125I-IFN-gamma for the receptor on mouse L cells. IFN-gamma-(1-39) also specifically blocked IFN-gamma antiviral activity at concentrations that blocked binding to the receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The antiproliferative effects of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were found to be cell-dependent. Among the human cell lines examined, IFN-gamma had a greater antiproliferative effect against cell lines that exhibited induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, such as the KB oral carcinoma or WiDr colon adenocarcinoma, than against those that lacked the enzyme activity, such as the SW480 colon adenocarcinoma or NCI-H128 small-cell lung carcinoma. Induction of this dioxygenase showed a clear temporal relationship with increased metabolism of L-tryptophan and the depletion of this amino acid in the culture medium. While 70-80% of L-tryptophan remained in the medium of IFN-alpha- or vehicle-treated cells, virtually all of this amino acid was depleted in the medium of the IFN-gamma-treated group following 2-3 days of culture. Supplementing the growth medium with additional L-tryptophan reversed the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma against KB cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma on SW480 and NCI-H128 cells, which are independent of the dioxygenase activity, and the inability of added L-tryptophan to reverse the effects of IFN-gamma in WiDr cells suggest multiple mechanisms of action of the IFNs. The data show that the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma through induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, with a consequent L-tryptophan deprivation, is an effective means of regulating cell growth.\r"

  ".U": "88125022\r", 
  ".W": "The astrocyte is now recognized as a facultative immunocompetent antigen-presenting cell that can initiate intracerebral immune responses. However, despite the presence of activated T lymphocytes and their associated lymphokines within the central nervous system, there is a paucity in the expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens on normal neural tissue. These membrane-localized glycoproteins are required for the process of antigen presentation and, therefore, for the initiation of immune responses. To date, little is understood regarding the nature of inhibitory mechanisms that might be responsible for maintaining the brain as an immunoprivileged site. In this study we found that norepinephrine, a major brain transmitter, significantly inhibited gamma interferon-induced MHC class II antigen expression on astrocytes derived from neonatal Lewis rats. We show that this inhibition can be attenuated by the addition of a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, but not by the addition of a beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol, or by an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine. Furthermore, it was found that a similar inhibition could be achieved by the addition of either dibutyryl-cAMP or dipyridimole, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Therefore, it seems that norepinephrine-mediated inhibition of MHC class II antigen expression on astrocytes works through beta 2-adrenergic signal transduction pathways. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that the brain contains inhibitory factors that may play a pivotal role in the regulation of intracerebral immune responses by modulating the expression of MHC antigens on astrocytes.\r"

Galanin hyperpolarizes and reduces spontaneous electrical activity by activating a population of ATP-sensitive K+ channels with a single-channel conductance of 30 pS (at -60 mV). Galanin-induced hyperpolarization and reduction of spike activity are reversed by the hypoglycemia-inducing sulfonylurea glibenclamide. Glibenclamide blocks the galanin-activated ATP-sensitive K+ channel. 86Rb+ efflux from insulinoma cells is stimulated by galanin in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximum value of activation is found at 1.6 nM. Galanin-induced 86Rb+ efflux is abolished by glibenclamide. The half-maximum value of inhibition is found at 0.3 nM, which is close to the half-maximum value of inhibition of the ATP-dependent K+ channel reported earlier. 86Rb+ efflux studies confirm the electrophysiological demonstration that galanin activates an ATP-dependent K+ channel.\r"

In this series of experiments, we have tested t-PA in a reliable microvascular thrombosis model previously developed in our laboratory. Its action in preventing thrombus formation and lysing fresh clot by direct local infusion and systemic infusion was tested. The results revealed that t-PA was able to keep locally infused vessels open for 4 hours and reopen them after they were allowed to clot in 100 percent of the animals tested. Those vessels exposed only to systemic levels of t-PA achieved by the same local infusion remained thrombosed and were unaffected. Laboratory studies showed no evidence of activation of the systemic lytic state or alteration in coagulation parameters. t-PA has proved to be a protein with characteristics that make it attractive for use in microvascular surgery. The results suggest that further research may lead the way toward clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "Asian Pacific Americans are one of the smallest but fastest growing minority groups in the United States. Between 1970 and 1980, this population increased 142 percent, from 1.5 million to 3.7 million. This dramatic growth is due largely to a change in U.S. immigration policies in the mid-1960s and the continuous influx of refugees from Southeast Asia since 1975. Despite such sharp increase, Asian Pacific Americans remain one of the most poorly understood minorities, and their health care needs have received relatively little attention. Health policy makers, planners, and service providers need to have a better understanding of the population characteristics of Asian Pacific Americans in order to address their needs properly. Asian Pacific Americans are largely recent immigrants and refugees. They are extremely heterogeneous and bipolar in socioeconomic status and health indices. Because of their small numbers until the last two decades, many health workers have had little exposure to this minority, their culture, and health problems. Health workers need to be sensitive to the ethnocultural barriers that confront recent arrivals; be aware of the genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and mental health problems common in this population; and realize that anatomical and physiological differences may require attention in certain surgical procedures and medical management. Neglecting the health care needs of Asian Pacific Americans is not simply a violation of the principle of equality for all, but also an imprudent act that increases the mortalities and morbidities and health care costs of the nation.\r"

In this study, measurements of blood pressure were taken of 8,353 adults living in California, including 1,757 Asians and Pacific Islanders, and the subjects were asked six questions concerning high blood pressure. The results show that Asians and Pacific Islanders with hypertension, in comparison with hypertensive persons of other races, were less likely to be aware of their hypertension, to be under treatment with medication, and to be controlling their blood pressure; similarly, they had their blood pressure measured less frequently and visited physicians less often. Compared with the general population, Asians and Pacific Islanders were less knowledgeable about hypertension. In relation to health care, they recorded lower frequencies of hospital stays, days of bed disabilities, and days of not feeling well than persons of other races. Asians and Pacific Islanders' lower treatment rates and knowledge level concerning hypertension may be related to the fact that a high percentage are foreign-born. Consequently, they have been taught less about hypertension, rely more on traditional methods of medicine, and are hampered by the lack of availability of health care providers of their own ethnic background. In addition, Filipinos have experienced high levels of poverty and lack of education. These factors require additional study as part of efforts to help improve health care for these ethnic groups in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "Senile dementia is a progressive and irreversible decline of mental functions. The symptoms are mental confusion, memory loss, disorientation, cognitive decline, and inappropriate social behavior. It is one of the most common, costly, and distressful diseases among the elderly in the United States. Information on the economic costs of senile dementia is essential for determining research priorities and the allocation of resources to support aging and medical research. Economic consequences, such as direct medical and nonmedical expenditures by patients' families and the amount of time by third parties in caring for patients with senile dementia, are substantial. However, little systematic accounting to estimate these consequences has been undertaken. This paper attempts to estimate various costs associated with the care of senile dementia, based on available secondary data. We have used the direct cost and indirect cost approach and avoided double counting to identify the additional economic costs due to senile dementia. The total, direct national cost of senile dementia is $13.26 billion, which includes $6.36 billion of medical care costs, $2.56 billion of nursing home care costs, and $4.34 billion of social agency service costs. The indirect cost for community home care alone is $31.46 billion, more than twice the total direct costs. The costs of premature death and loss of productivity due to senile dementia are about $43.17 billion. Although most of the indirect costs were imputed from the value of housekeeping or productivity loss, the magnitude of indirect costs reflects the serious consequences and burden on society's resources of this disease.\r"

Since the last progress report, published in 1984, more than 200 research projects directly related to these objectives have been funded, and a variety of implementation actions have been undertaken. During this period, baseline data on such critical concerns as homicides among blacks and Hispanics, suicide, family violence, and perceived stress have been obtained, thereby encouraging further study and facilitating achievement of the objectives. The mid-decade status report and recommendations that are presented in this article were initiated in a September 1985 review, by the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health, of progress toward achieving the 10 stress and violent behavior objectives selected for Federal implementation by the year 1990. The most recent available data have been used to update information on these 10 priority objectives.\r"

An alternative strategy at the camp consisted of dispersal of exposed persons from the camp and their being quarantined in their home States. Three deaths (case-fatality ratio = 2.2 percent) were reported at the college; no serious complications were reported from the camp-associated epidemic. No transmission into the general community occurred in either epidemic. Public health officials are encouraged to be aware of the legal rights and obligations of religiously exempt groups so that outbreaks in these groups can be effectively controlled, even if standard immunization strategies are not possible.

None belonged to other AIDS risk groups. HIV antibody was detected in four (19 percent) of the female partners. HIV was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of one hemophiliac (4.8 percent), and one female partner (4.8) was antibody-positive. None of the couples engaged in anal intercourse. Compared with HIV antibody-negative female partners, HIV antibody-positive female partners were younger (P less than .05), had younger hemophiliac partners (P less than .05), and were likely (although not significantly so) to engage in oral sex (P = .08) and to have had more than one sexual partner in the previous 5 years (P = .08). Condoms were used all the time by only eight couples (40 percent), and pregnancy occurred in two other couples (9.5 percent), despite prior counseling. These data confirm the low frequency of heterosexual transmission of HIV from HIV antibody-positive hemophiliacs to their female sexual partners and suggest, moreover, that this may be due to the low rate of HIV infectivity in HIV seropositive hemophiliacs exposed to HIV. Further, these data document the need to design more effective educational programs to prevent heterosexual transmission of HIV.\r"

The hearing sensitivity for all subjects decreased with advancing age and at higher frequencies, but hearing loss over the range most susceptible to excessive noise exposure (3,000-6,000 Hz) was much greater for males than for females at all ages. The hearing loss was greater than could be accounted for by age and was similar whether the subject was a farmer or not. The results suggested that approximately 25 percent of the males had a communication handicap due to hearing loss by age 30, and the proportion rose to 50 percent by age 50. Less than 20 percent of farmers reported consistent use of personal hearing protection in their farm-related duties. Overall, the findings suggest that men who live in rural areas, including farmers, demonstrate a high prevalence of hearing loss and associated communication problems due to excessive noise exposure. This, in turn, clearly indicates a need for intensification of educational hearing conservation programs for the rural population.\r"

  ".W": "In a cooperative effort among the Centers for Disease Control, the Yale University Department of Epidemiology, and the Connecticut State Department of Health Services, an epidemiology demonstration training program was established in which student-faculty rapid response teams responded to requests from the State and from local health departments to investigate acute disease outbreaks or the health effects of natural experiments. Over five academic semesters, 23 teams, consisting of a total of 76 students, responded to requests and produced reports regarding the etiology and recommendations for control to the appropriate agencies. By the end of the fifth semester, there had been three papers or reports published in medical or public health journals, two papers accepted for publication, four presentations at meetings, and five additional manuscripts had been submitted to journals or were being prepared for submission. Throughout the experience, a high level of cooperation between local and State health departments and the school of public health was maintained. Involved students, faculty, and State investigators believed the experience to be highly productive and worthwhile.\r"

  ".W": "State Crippled Children's (CC) programs are known for their diversity in organization and varying coverage of diagnostic categories. Relatively little information is available concerning the programmatic priorities of CC agencies. To identify the activities central to the mission of State CC agencies, a survey was undertaken. Results from the survey revealed considerable unanimity among CC directors in identifying activities deemed to be very important to their agencies' missions. However, CC program directors indicated that their agencies were unable to spend sufficient amounts of time working on many of these activities. With few exceptions, the same activities were accorded high priority regardless of the particular organizational type of CC program and regardless of the tenure of the director. Directors of CC programs were also consistent in identifying activities that were relatively less important to their agencies' missions, including activities related to community-based care. Together with improvements in the treatment of childhood chronic illness, changes in the availability and financing of specialty medical care have substantially altered the problems that now face State CC programs. Despite major differences across the State CC programs, survey results reflect a broad consensus among CC directors concerning the current role of their agencies in the care of children with special health needs. Such a consensus may be an important element in gaining the additional resources needed to address current problems and to ensure high quality of care for these children and their families.\r"

  ".W": "The suspicion that the use of tobacco adversely affects health existed for some time before a case-control study appeared in 1950 of 684 cases of lung cancer strongly associated with cigarette smoking. This paper, a brief history, describes the background of the 1950 landmark study as well as other pertinent epidemiologic and experimental studies of the 1950s and 1960s. This body of research provided evidence for the causative association between tobacco use and lung cancer and other chronic diseases such as several other types of cancer and coronary heart disease. Despite this body of evidence, support from scientists, health professionals, and government officials on the issue of smoking and health came slowly. The scientific application of this discovery to prevent tobacco-linked diseases continues to be far more difficult than the discoveries themselves. Thus, although the low-yield cigarette has provided some assistance to smokers, smoking prevention is far more important, and greater efforts are needed to achieve cessation, particularly among women and minority groups. Beyond this approach, efforts to prevent children and young people from beginning to smoke should stress State-mandated school health education beginning in the earliest grades. The Know Your Body School Education Program, which includes an annual screening with the results entered into a personalized Health Passport starting in first grade, has demonstrated reductions in onset of smoking as well as improved health behavior in nutrition. To further reduce tobacco use, cancer prevention units staffed by health educators, behavioral scientists, and epidemiologists should practice prevention on a communitywide basis. The prevention of diseases as the ultimate aim of medicine and science can be demonstrated by the smoking and health issue that establishes that the prevention of many cancers is attainable.\r"

This paper presents the results of a cost-effectiveness analysis from a recently completed randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of self-help smoking cessation methods for pregnant women in public health maternity clinics. The study population--309 pregnant smokers from 3 prenatal clinics--were randomly assigned, during their first clinic visit, to 1 of 3 groups: (a) group 1 received the standard clinic information and advice to quit smoking, (b) group 2 received the standard clinic information and advice to quit plus the manual \"Freedom From Smoking in 20 Days\" by the American Lung Association, and (c) group 3 received the standard clinic information and advice to quit plus the pregnancy-specific manual \"A Pregnant Woman's Self-Help Guide to Quit Smoking.\" The quit rates by the end of pregnancy were 2 percent for group 1, 6 percent for group 2, and 14 percent for group 3. Analyses also indicated that the method used for group 3 was the most cost effective: group 3 achieved smoking cessation at less than half the cost experienced by the other two groups. Although additional studies are needed concerning the behavioral impact, cost effectiveness, and cost benefit of self-help health education methods for smoking cessation, the methods tested in this trial are promising as solutions to part of the problem of low birth weight among infants of smoking mothers in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "The use of primary health care services by urban American Indians and their health problems were compared with national and regional data compiled by the Indian Health Service, Bureau of the Census, Office of Technology Assessment, and the National Center for Health Statistics. A survey of medical records was conducted at urban Indian health clinics, one located in Oklahoma City, OK, and the other in Wichita, KS. Health records of 500 patients from each clinic were reviewed. Information was gathered concerning reasons for visit, diagnoses, and number of physician visits. In addition, predisposing variables and enabling variables from each patient's registration form were reviewed. According to the data collected in the survey, the clientele of these urban Indian clinics have annual incomes well below the average income of the general population and the overall American Indian population in these cities. Their lack of health insurance and low education levels were also evident. Use of primary health services was below that of the general population, and lower, but relatively close, to use levels of American Indians residing in rural Oklahoma and Kansas. Information on health problems indicated high levels of diabetes mellitus and hypertension among the middle-age groups, and high levels of use by young women for prenatal care and contraception. The absence of systematically collected and comprehensive health and health care use information about urban American Indians, who now comprise more than half the U.S. American Indian population, and the limitations in the available information leave important questions unanswered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of the synthesis of membrane-bound and secreted immunoglobulin mu heavy chains at the level of RNA processing is an important element for B cell development. The precursor mu RNA is either polyadenylated at the upstream poly(A) site (for the secreted form) or spliced (for the membrane-bound form) in a mutually exclusive manner. When the mouse mu gene linked to the SV40/HSV-TK hybrid promoter was microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, the mu messenger RNA (mRNA) was altered by coinjection of nuclei of mouse surface IgM-bearing B-lymphoma cells to include the synthesis of the membrane-bound form. An increase in the membrane-bound form was not observed when nuclei of IgM-secreting hybridoma cells or fibroblast cells were coinjected. Deletion of the upstream poly(A) site did not eliminate the effect of B-lymphoma nuclei suggesting that membrane-specific splicing is stimulated. Further, splicing of other mu gene introns was not affected by coinjection of B-lymphoma nuclei. These results suggest that mature B cells contain one or more transacting nuclear factors that stimulate splicing specific for membrane-bound mu mRNA.\r"

Treatment with either native or recombinant somatotropin augmented the production of O2- by both peripheral blood-derived and alveolar macrophages stimulated with opsonized zymosan in vitro. This effect was abolished by prior treatment with an antibody specific for somatotropin. When either native or recombinant porcine somatotropin or native rat somatotropin was administered to hypophysectomized rats in vivo, activation of peritoneal macrophages, as measured by release of O2- in response to opsonized zymosan, was equivalent to that of macrophages from rats primed with the macrophage-activating factor interferon-gamma. Priming of macrophages in vivo was observed at physiologically relevant doses of somatotropin that caused a 10 to 40 percent increase in growth rate. Priming of mononuclear phagocytes for augmented production of reactive oxygen metabolites is a newly defined property of somatotropin.\r"

Experiments with tumor-promoting phorbol esters indicated that activation of protein kinase C can also cause the glands to increase protein synthesis. Stimulation of protein synthesis by juvenile hormone did not occur in mutants deficient in kinase C activity. These results suggest a membrane-protein-mediated effect of juvenile hormone that involves calcium and kinase C.\r"

Patients were categorized as those having culture-negative TLC tips either with or without infection elsewhere (groups 1 and 2, respectively) and those with culture-positive TLC tips (group 3). Temperature, WBC, alkaline phosphatase value, and SGOT level were recorded one or two days before TLC removal (period 1) and one or two days or three to five days after TLC removal (periods 2 and 3, respectively). The incidence of catheter sepsis was 4%. Fourteen other tips were contaminated. Patients in group 1 remained afebrile during all three periods, and all tips removed were culture-negative. Removal of the TLC in groups 2 and 3 caused neither defervescence nor decreased WBC. We conclude that TLCs can be used for total parenteral nutrition with a low incidence of infection, that TLC tips need not be cultured in afebrile patients without other sources of infection, and that a TLC can be safely left in place so long as the patient is afebrile. However, the risk of infection or contamination is high for catheters left in place for more than two weeks.\r"

With extensive cross-reactivity, and several proposed sites of action, LAs and their effects may be heterogeneous. While the risk of thrombosis with phenothiazine-induced LAs is probably low, the incidence of thrombosis in association with procainamide-induced LAs is uncertain. Procainamide is a commonly used antiarrhythmic drug associated with the induction of autoantibodies, and occasionally with a lupus-like syndrome. Serologic and coagulation profile monitoring may be required to detect patients in whom LAs develop since these individuals may be at increased risk for thrombosis. Monitoring may be especially important in patients who are receiving procainamide and who have atherosclerosis and cardiac disease, since they may be at increased risk for thrombosis of coronary and other arteries. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether the development of lupus anticoagulants during procainamide therapy increases the risk of thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "We have isotopically determined rates of whole-body protein synthesis and catabolism in a group of normal volunteers and in two groups of cancer patients: 20 patients with advanced weight-loss (AWL) upper gastrointestinal cancer and 7 patients with early non-weight-loss (ENWL) lower gastrointestinal cancer. In both patients and volunteers we determined protein kinetics in the basal state and during glucose infusion at 4 mg/kg/min. In addition, in the AWL patients the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on protein dynamics was also assessed. The rate of net protein breakdown was determined with the primed constant infusion of either 15N-urea or 14C-urea, the rate of whole-body protein catabolism was measured with the primed constant infusion of 15N-lysine, and the rate of whole-body protein synthesis was deduced from the above two values. The basal rates of net protein catabolism, whole-body protein catabolism, and whole-body protein synthesis were similar in the volunteers and ENWL cancer patients. The basal values for net protein catabolism in the volunteers and ENWL patients were 1.46 +/- 0.18 and 1.34 +/- 0.08 gm/kg/min, respectively. In both volunteers and ENWL patients glucose infusion resulted in a significant decrease in net protein catabolism. In the ENWL patients this decrease was due to a significant decrease in whole-body protein catabolism (p less than 0.05); the rate of whole-body protein synthesis did not change significantly. In the AWL cancer patients the rate of net protein catabolism was significantly higher than in either the volunteer or ENWL group (p less than 0.05), and glucose infusion did not result in a decrease in net protein catabolism. However, when the AWL group was studied during TPN there was a significant decrease in net protein catabolism from 2.24 +/- 0.30 to 0.17 +/- 0.09 gm/kg/day (p less than 0.01). This decrease was due to the combined effect of a significant decrease in whole-body protein catabolism coupled with an increase in whole-body protein synthesis. From these studies we conclude the following: (1) ENWL cancer patients and normal volunteers have similar protein dynamics, and in both groups glucose infusion resulted in a significant decrease in protein loss. (2) AWL cancer patients have an elevated rate of net protein catabolism, and this is not sensitive to glucose infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To find a predictive value for the infection of the catheter, semiquantitative blood cultures taken through the TPN catheter were examined during the pyretic episodes. A total of 227 catheters from 204 patients were studied. Of these 149 were investigated during pyretic episodes. Twenty TPN catheters were removed because their semiquantitative blood cultures were positive, and in all cases the clinical conditions of the patients improved after removal of the catheters. The remaining 129 catheters investigated showed negative results and had predictive values of 100%. These catheters were left in place and all subsequently proved to be sterile on their removal at the end of the TPN. Thus 87% of the 149 suspected catheters were saved.\r"

Multiple abutting IORT fields were used in 76% of the patients; they encompassed treatment areas as large as 569 cm2 and involved as many as five separate IORT applications. Multiple fields were matched along straight edges on the treatment applicators or provided by means of lead shielding strips. Areas of field overlap were prevented by the use of lead shields.

Pulmonary haemodynamics were measured in 45 patients yielding the following mean values: pulmonary artery pressure 28.3 mm Hg; cardiac output 5.9 l min-1; total pulmonary vascular resistance 59.2 kPa l-1 S. Oxygen delivery systems, including 23 oxygen concentrators, were installed in the patients' homes. Flow rates were adjusted to raise PaO2 to more than 8.0 kPa (60 mm Hg) for at least 15 hours each day and close supervision was maintained. Overall five year survival was 62%, which is better than previously reported for this type of patient; but the 10 year survival was only 26% owing to an observed acceleration in death rate at about this time. Progressive disturbances of the pulmonary circulation were arrested. Mortality was associated with the severity of airflow obstruction, reflecting a continuing pathological process affecting the airways.\r"

The effect of heat treatment on factor VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and other proteins present in the concentrates (albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, IgG, and IgM) was evaluated. Heat-induced protein aggregation, particularly of fibrinogen and fibronectin, occurred within 48 hours in the intermediate-purity concentrates and correlated well with decreased solubility of these products. Heated fibrinogen-poor concentrates were readily soluble and did not show protein aggregation even after 72 hours at 60 degrees C. Neither concentrate developed detectable neoantigens when tested against antisera to whole human plasma and to heated and unheated concentrates. Aggregation of the vWf molecule, detected by altered mobility in crossed immunoelectrophoresis and multimeric analysis in SDS agarose gels, occurred in heated intermediate-purity concentrates but not in fibrinogen-poor concentrates. Thus, higher-purity factor VIII concentrates withstand heat treatment better than concentrates that contain greater levels of contaminating proteins, particularly fibrinogen.\r"

Nine women in the control group received normal saline in place of TRH. The TRH group demonstrated a significant drop in urethral closure pressure (p less than 0.01) within two minutes after TRH injection. Eight women complained of urinary urgency during the interval of observed drop in urethral closure pressure. No significant changes were seen in true detrusor pressure in both the TRH and in the control groups. The close association of drop in urethral pressure and urinary urgency suggests the presence of a motor component to this either centrally or peripherally mediated urinary urgency following TRH administration.\r"

  ".W": "Transient myocardial ischemia is more frequently silent than accompanied by angina. The frequency of ischemia varies markedly from day to day, so that in order to accurately define the total ischemic burden, it may be necessary to quantitate ischemic episodes for periods longer than 24 hours. Therefore, a programmable, digital device was developed for long-term, interactive, ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, which uses variations in a time-averaged ST level as an indicator of myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiographic signal is digitized at 256 Hz and analyzed by an algorithm. If ST depression is planar or downsloping and persists for more than 40 seconds, and if the ST depression is equal to or more than a user-programmed threshold, the device marks the onset of an ischemic event and times it. The algorithm has been validated by comparison of its analysis of the ST segment to human and computerized analyses of frequency-modulated Holter recordings and stress tests. To assess the feasibility and utility of long-term monitoring, patients with documented coronary artery disease were monitored continuously for 14-day periods. Of 26 patients enrolled, 8 completed a protocol for individualization of anti-ischemic therapy using transdermal nitroglycerin. Over 90% of ischemic episodes in this group of patients, all of whom had had a previous myocardial infarction, were silent. Treatment with 10 mg of transdermal nitroglycerin reduced the number of ischemic episodes by 59% and the duration of ischemia by 60% (p less than 0.001); there was no diminution in the effectiveness of treatment from week 1 to week 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this retrospective case-controlled study was to identify clinically useful parameters that would predict aggravation of arrhythmia. Patients in whom arrhythmia worsened while taking either quinidine, mexiletine or encainide were selected and matched to 2 similar patients who never developed this drug complication with any antiarrhythmic tested. A number of hemodynamic, electrophysiologic and pharmacologic parameters were compared. Only the presenting arrhythmia and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% identified patients at risk for drug-induced aggravation of arrhythmia. Patients who presented with either sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were 3.4 times more likely to have arrhythmia aggravation compared with patients presenting with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular premature beats. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% were 2.2 times more likely to develop this drug complication compared with patients with an ejection fraction greater than 35%. There was no association between other clinical parameters, electrocardiographic intervals, ventricular arrhythmia density, drug dose or drug levels and aggravation of arrhythmia. In addition, drug aggravation to 1 drug did not predict its occurrence with another drug of the same class. Patients with a history of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia, especially when left ventricular dysfunction is present, are at high risk for the development of aggravation of arrhythmia.\r"

Platelet function, plasma lipids, and apoproteins were similar before both treatment periods. The vitamin E treatment resulted in 1) diminution of platelet aggregation with ADP 2.5 microM (56 +/- 4 vs 47 +/- 4 cm2, p = 0.05) and 5 microM (70 +/- 5 vs 57 +/- 4 cm2, p less than 0.01); 2) diminution of malondialdehyde release from platelets (6.4 +/- 0.5 vs 5.0 +/- 0.7 nmol/10(9) platelets, p less than 0.02); and 3) diminution in the percentage of 14C TXB2 (38.1 +/- 2.8 vs 33.3 +/- 3.0%, p less than 0.05). No significant changes were observed on placebo. Results indicate that high doses of vitamin E diminish ADP-induced platelet aggregation in Type I diabetic patients and suggest that this effect is partly mediated through a diminution of the cyclooxygenase activity.\r"

In a cross-over design, each patient received two 6-d periods of isocaloric and isonitrogenous (450 mg.kg-1.d-1) infusions, differing only by the source of calories (high or low fat intakes). Half of the patients were studied at 60 kcal.kg-1.d-1, the other half at 80 kcal.kg-1.d-1. Nitrogen balance, urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion, glycemia, and insulin were compared. The results suggest that for an intravenous energy intake ranging from 60 to 80 kcal.kg-1.d-1, glucose and fat provide an equivalent nitrogen sparing effect in the newborn infant. At an energy level covering maintenance requirements, it is the infant's clinical condition rather than the source of energy which affects most the magnitude of amino acids participation in energy metabolism.\r"

Most of the free-living children in Dakar suffered from mild to moderate PEM. The specific thymulin activity (total plasma activity minus the activity recorded after adsorption of the plasma with a monoclonal antithymulin antibody) was almost undetectable in the infected children and was normal only in the children living in Paris. Such activity might be decreased by moderate and severe PEM and severe malnutrition may not be the only underlying cause of depressed level of thymulin in malnourished children from the Third World. Concurrent infections are important factors.\r"

The polymorphism of the MHC loci can be used as markers for immune response because the recognition of antigens involves their interaction with the MHC antigens. Specific portions of an antigen bind to the polymorphic region of class II molecules. Identification of an MHC class II molecule with a peptide results in a lack of an immune response as a result of self-tolerance. Similarities, but not identity of these molecules, result in immune responses restricted by the variable region of the MHC (class II molecule). This also explains a high repertoire of alloreactive T-cells. (2) By virtue of their restriction of the immune response to foreign antigens that cross-react with self-antigen, the MHC genes or genes within or near the MHC region show an association with the autoimmune diseases. (3) Several alleles encoded by different MHC loci are found nonrandomly associated at the population level. The resulting haplotypes could predict identity of segments of chromosome 6 among unrelated persons. (4) Matching of nonrandomly associated alleles (extended haplotypes) can serve potentially for selection of donors for allotransplantation, especially of bone marrow. (5) Several diseases associated with alleles of the class II MHc loci, and at least in the case of the lack of response to hepatitis B vaccine, have been shown to be more significantly associated with extended haplotypes. In such cases, the extended haplotypes may contain a susceptibility MHC allele of a known MHC locus or may contain a susceptibility gene of a yet undiscovered locus.\r"

A polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor, eflornithine (chemical name, DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, supplied as monohydrochloride monohydrate), was used to treat a 3 1/2-year-old child with newly diagnosed severe trypanosomiasis that had been acquired more than two years previously in Zaire or the Congo. Treatment consisted of 300 to 400 mg/kg/d of eflornithine by continuous intravenous infusion for 25 days followed by 300 mg/kg/d of eflornithine by mouth divided in four equal doses daily for 17 days. The child's recovery was dramatic, with eradication of blood and cerebrospinal fluid parasites in the first week. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis resolved completely. Her generalized adenopathy and fever gradually resolved. Severe ataxia, inability to walk or to change posture on her own, marked language regression, and lethargy all improved during and after her therapy. The drug was well tolerated; the only noted adverse effect was transient thrombocytopenia during the fourth week of therapy. Eflornithine was a safe and effective agent for treatment of trypanosomiasis with central nervous system involvement in this child.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of previous studies, we showed that misoprostol protects the gastric and duodenal mucosae against ulceration seen with the administration of both aspirin and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug tolmetin. The purpose of this study was to confirm, in addition, that misoprostol protects the mucosae against aspirin-induced damage and, for the first time, to compare its cytoprotective properties with those of sucralfate. Thirty healthy volunteers were randomized into three equal groups receiving either misoprostol 200 micrograms, sucralfate 1 g, or placebo, co-administered with 650 mg of aspirin, four times a day for 7 days. All subjects had endoscopically normal mucosae on entry and were reendoscoped 2 h after a single final dose on day 7. The mucosae were graded on a 0-4 scale as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = single hemorrhage or erosion, 2 = 2-10 hemorrhages or erosions, 3 = 11-25 hemorrhages or erosions, 4 = more than 25 hemorrhages or erosions or an invasive ulcer of any size. Utilizing a previously established criterion of a score of 2 or less as a clinically significant degree of protection to the gastric mucosae, we found that the success rate for misoprostol was 100% (10/10), compared to 20% (2/10) for sucralfate and 0% (0/10) for placebo. Misoprostol was statistically significantly superior to both sucralfate (p = 0.0001) and placebo (p = 0.00001), with 95% confidence intervals on the difference in success rates between misoprostol and sucralfate and between misoprostol and placebo of (44%; 100%) and (61%; 100%), respectively. In the duodenum, nine of 10 subjects taking misoprostol showed no damage (0 grade), whereas this was seen in only five sucralfate and three placebo patients. Misoprostol was significantly superior to placebo (p = 0.020) and marginally superior to sucralfate (p = 0.141) with confidence intervals of (29%; 91%) and (-5%; 67%), respectively. Adverse experiences were minor and did not differ in the three groups.\r"

To minimize risk of complications following PEG, we have modified the conventional method to include selection of a \"safe gastrocutaneous fistulous tract,\" using an aspirating, lidocaine-filled syringe and needle. \"Safe tracts\" prior to PEG placement were determined by simultaneous air return in the aspirating syringe and endoscopic visualization of the intragastric needle. This technique was used to compare the results of PEG in 27 operated and 80 nonoperated patients. Our results show that morbidity and mortality rates and types of complications following PEG in previously operated and nonoperated patients are comparable, but technical success rates are slightly lower in the surgical group (88 vs 100%). The incidence of failed PEGs was highest in patients with partial gastric resection compared to those with intact stomachs (29 vs 5.0% p less than 0.05). PEG was safely and successfully performed in all cases (surgical and nonsurgical) when safe tracts were confirmed. Selection of a safe tract should be made prior to PEG placement, especially in patients with prior abdominal surgery.\r"

The MAb 33B3.1 had been administered intravenously (IV) at 10 mg per day for 2 weeks. Clinical and biological tolerance were excellent. Only one patient had a rejection episode (reversible) during the MAb treatment period. These results were significantly better than those recorded from a historical group of patients that received only prednisone and azathioprine, and were similar to those from patients who received antithymocyte globulin instead of 33B3.1. There was no life threatening infectious episode and all patients are alive. Ninety-seven percent of the patients have a functional graft (follow-up, 30 to 210 days). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of 33B3.1 indicate that circulating trough blood level peaked at day 6 (30 nm). The majority of patients (85%) developed either IgG or IgM antibodies with a maximal response at day 24 for both isotypes. We conclude that this new treatment that targets a functional receptor present on activated lymphocytes only, is well tolerated and highly efficient in preventing early rejection after human renal transplantation.\r"

The toxin-related T cell growth factor fusion gene has been cloned in Escherichia coli K12. Recombinant strains of E coli produce a 68,086 K hybrid toxin, IL-2 toxin that retains immunologic properties intrinsic to both its diphtheria toxin and IL-2 components. IL-2 toxin has been found to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in both human and murine T cell lines that bear high affinity IL-2 receptors, whereas the hybrid toxin is not active against cells that do not bear this receptor. The cytotoxic action of IL-2 toxin is specifically blocked by free IL-2 and monoclonal antibodies that bind to the p55 (Tac antigen) subunit of the high affinity IL-2 receptor. In addition, IL-2 toxin, like diphtheria toxin itself, must pass through an acidic compartment in order to deliver its adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity to the cytosol of target T cells. In a murine delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) model system, we have shown that IL-2 toxin treatment induces a marked immunosuppression.\r"

Rejections reversed in 85% of 26 patients treated within 90 days of transplantation. Late rejections treated more than 90 days after transplantation were poorly responsive to OKT3 and graft survival for this group of five patients was poor (20%). However, for those patients treated with OKT3 for early resistant rejection, actuarial 4-year graft survival was 66%. Actuarial 4-year patient survival was 97%, and the incidence of serious infection was low. Acute rejections in cadaver transplantation are common and a small percentage of rejections are resistant to steroids and ATG. OKT3 has proven to be useful for reversing these resistant rejections without causing significant morbidity from infection or death.\r"

A similar phenomenon is known among the Ashkenazi Jews, in whom four of the most frequent hereditary disorders are lysosomal storage disorders, which are characterized by storage of sphingolipid derivatives. Similar findings are reported in the literature in other communities. We suggest that this phenomenon indicates a selection in favor of lysosomal storage disorders of similar nature in certain populations. The selection forces leading to this phenomenon have not been identified yet, and it has not yet been determined whether these forces are the same in the different communities presented here.\r"

Thirteen patients were randomized to receive intranasal buserelin (400 micrograms 3 times a day) or subcutaneous buserelin injection (200 micrograms once daily) for a 6- to 9-month period. Both routes of administration were effective in inhibiting serum estradiol levels to near the menopausal range after 1 month of treatment. The two dosage regimens had also a comparable efficacy in alleviating endometriosis symptoms and in reducing the revised American Fertility Society scoring at laparoscopic examination. The implant score mainly decreased by more than 70%. The occurrence of side effects was similar in both groups, and side effects were mainly hot flushes, dyspareunia secondary to decreased vaginal secretion, and decreased libido. Results of hemogram, urinalysis, and serum biochemical and hormonal tests remained in the normal range. The ovulatory cycle rapidly returned after the cessation of treatment, and three pregnancies occurred in six previously infertile patients. Intranasal and subcutaneous buserelin were well accepted and equally effective in inhibiting the pituitary-ovarian function, which caused mild menopausal symptoms but an important regression of endometriosis.\r"

Cross-sectional uterine biopsy specimens were taken from both horns at the time of implantation and at 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. Twenty-nine levonorgestrel-treated and 33 controls survived to the completion of the study. The incidence of endometrial neoplasia of 17.2% in the group treated with levonorgestrel was significantly less (p less than 0.05) than the 42.4% incidence observed in the control does. Before the completion of the study, one levonorgestrel-treated doe died and was found to have an endometrial tumor. When the findings of this doe are included in the report, the statistical significance is marginally lost. No endometrial neoplasia was found in the eight does with serum levonorgestrel concentrations greater than 0.12 ng/ml. Only one of the five tumors in the levonorgestrel-treated group occurred in the horn containing the levonorgestrel implant, which suggests that a dose effect is likely. Treatment with levonorgestrel decreases the incidence of endometrial neoplasia in rabbits. This finding gives further credence to the use of progestogen supplementation in women at risk for developing endometrial neoplasia.\r"

Patients were studied for a 1-hour control period breathing room air followed by four randomized 15-minute study periods with patients breathing either room air, a prepared gas mixture with 2% or 4% carbon dioxide, or undergoing controlled hyperventilation as determined by monitoring end-tidal PCO2. The percentage of time fetal breathing movements correlated significantly with maternal end-tidal PCO2 (r = 0.62, p less than 0.01), increasing with maternal breathing of 2% and 4% carbon dioxide and decreasing with maternal hyperventilation. Fetal gross body movements, fetal heart rate, and fetal heart rate variability showed no significant changes. It is concluded that as in adults, the carbon dioxide level in fetuses is an important stimulus for the generation of respiratory movements, acting independent of a change in behavioral state. It is hypothesized that tonic carbon dioxide level input is an important determinant of fetal respiratory center drive, but little or no phasic carbon dioxide input exists because of continuous placental excretion, thus resulting in the episodic occurrence of breathing movements with changes in the fetal behavioral state.\r"

Granulosa cells obtained from pregnant mare serum gonadotropin-primed rats were maintained in primary culture. Treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone (0.5 microgram/ml), 8-bromo-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (2 mmol/L), or cholera toxin (0.1 microgram/ml) for 5 hours or 24 hours markedly stimulated progesterone production. The concomitant presence of A23187 attenuated the elevated levels of progesterone induced by follicle-stimulating hormone, 8-bromo-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, or cholera toxin, with or without the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.2 mmol/L). Likewise, treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate suppressed follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone production, whether or not 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine was present in the cultures. The effect of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate was not mimicked by phorbol-13-monoacetate or 4 alpha-phorbol-12, 13-didecanoate. These results indicate that both A23187 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate inhibit follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone production, in part at a step or steps beyond adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate generation and degradation. They further support a role of calcium and protein kinase C in the intraovarian action of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone.\r"

We report the endocrine response of a quintuplet pregnancy that was reduced at 9 weeks' gestation to a twin pregnancy by selective embryocide and compared with quadruplet, triplet, and twin pregnancies. The human chorionic gonadotropin titer declined fourfold, but there were no clinically significant changes in the progesterone or estradiol levels. We conclude that, despite the drop in human chorionic gonadotropin, the placenta had attained adequate secretory maturation to prevent any significant decline in progesterone and estradiol levels, which demonstrates the efficacy of this procedure at this gestational age.\r"

A survey of the relevant literature suggests that management of the pregnant patient with neurofibromatosis is an obstetric challenge. After appropriate genetic counseling, patients with minimal or mild neurofibromatosis who wish to conceive should receive high-risk pregnancy care. Special attention should be directed toward maternal hypertension and the aggravating features of neurofibromatosis. The fetus may inherit the disease and also be at risk for growth retardation. Patients with severe neurofibromatosis should be advised not to conceive.\r"

In those women with normal pregnancies, the mean 24-hour values of atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone increased, compared with the levels in normal nonpregnant subjects. In cases of severe preeclampsia, levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher than in the other subjects, but aldosterone levels decreased to nearly those seen in the nonpregnant subjects. Atrial natriuretic peptide did not establish a rhythm in normal nonpregnant and pregnant subjects, but in the studies of aldosterone levels, a clear circadian rhythm was evident. In severe cases of preeclampsia, atrial natriuretic peptide established a circadian rhythm similar to that of blood pressure, and the circadian rhythm of aldosterone disappeared. The main characteristic of the rhythm in atrial natriuretic peptide and blood pressure in women showing preeclamptic signs is that the acrophase occurred at midnight. This evidence suggests that in women with symptoms of preeclampsia the load to the atria increases at midnight.\r"

In these experiments the authors have explored the role of lipoproteins in the activation of human blood monocytes. Monocytes were purified from citrated blood by Histopaque density gradient centrifugation and countercurrent centrifugal elutriation and cultured in DMEM in the presence of 20% acid-treated autologous serum or 100 micrograms/ml each of VLDL, LDL, Ac-LDL, and HDL. Secretion of beta-glucuronidase activity into the media was measured as a marker of activation. All of the lipoprotein density classes as well as serum stimulated secretion of beta-glucuronidase activity, with LDL and Ac-LDL having a greater influence than serum, VLDL, or HDL. Serum and LDL also stimulated secretion of prostaglandin E into the culture medium. Incubation of monocytes with serum or LDL in the presence of inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism (NDGA and indomethacin) resulted in a significant decrease in secreted and intracellular beta-glucuronidase activity, indicating a role for products of arachidonate metabolism in the activation of monocytes by lipoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "In schistosomiasis mansoni the parasite egg-induced granulomatous tissue inflammations resolve by fibrosis. Intralesional collagen synthesis and deposition are influenced by collagenase, elastase activity that is diminished at the chronic stage of the disease. To determine the cause of diminished neutral protease activity, the authors determined levels of the antiprotease/alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1Pi) in extracts or secretions of liver granulomas of infected mice. By ELISA, both antiproteases were detected in granuloma-derived substances, as well as supernatants of cultured, adherent granuloma macrophages. In all samples, alpha 2M was the predominant inhibitor. Antiprotease levels were similar in granuloma-derived samples obtained from acutely and chronically infected mice. However, supernatants of cultured adherent macrophages isolated from granulomas of mice with acute infection contained levels of protease inhibitors several times higher than those of similar preparations obtained from chronically infected animals. Gel filtration of samples on Sephacryl S-200 columns did not separate collagenase and elastase from protease inhibitors. By chromatofocusing, a few inhibitor-free collagenase as well as enzyme-free alpha 2M and alpha 1Pi-active peaks were eluted. The bulk of the material that eluted at the acidic region contained protease-antiprotease activity indicating the presence of enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The intragranulomatous presence of antiproteases complexed with protease enzymes emphasizes their importance in the possible enhancement of fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The histogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma was investigated by immunohistochemical staining of 20 skin specimens that represented four main histologic stages. The early phase of Stage 1 contained lymphatic-like clefts lined by endothelial cells with thin, discontinuous basement membranes shown by anti-laminin, absent Factor VIII-related antigen reactivity (FVIIIRAg), and only rare staining with dilute Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I). In the late phase of Stage 1, the clefts developed into anastomosing, blood-filled channels, and the basement membrane became complete. Endothelial marker reactivities were not definitive, but weak staining with UEA-I and variable staining for FVIIIRAg characterized the spindle cells of Stage 2. However, spindle cells in monomorphic nodules were individually enclosed by immunoreactive laminin. The sequence of events, particularly in light of previous angiographic findings of lymphaticovenous union, suggests a disturbance in lymphaticovenous differentiation in Kaposi's sarcoma. Sclerotic closure of channels unable to maintain competent blood flow may select against lymphendothelial traits in the developing spindle cell nodule.\r"

The goal of rehabilitation in head injured patients consists of returning to work and adaptation to: interpersonal consequences of disability; new affective needs; and capacity to attend to financial, legal and bureaucratic matters. The achievement of these goals goes far beyond neurological boundaries in the ordinary narrow sense and needs a neuropsycho-social approach. Neuropsycho-social rehabilitation in head injury has multidimensional clinical aspects. Two problems should be emphasised: a) gross neurological disability (mono, hemi, para and triplegia) found in the presence of good cognitive function (patients easy to rehabilitate) and b) minor neurological disability found in the presence of gross cognitive impairment (patients not easy to rehabilitate). Posttraumatic epilepsy needs general criteria for its management. It is preferable to wait for the first seizure in order to start anticonvulsant treatment, except for 3 at risk conditions: 1) diffuse bilateral injury 2) prolonged coma, and 3) intracerebral hematoma. The first 3 years is the maximum at risk period. The traumatic syndrome consisting of impaired insight and behaviour disturbances is underdiagnosed owing to the absence of neurological signs. The sleep disturbances accompanying head injury are usually underestimated.\r"

In this study we show how basic analysis of a large administrative data set, combined with a review of evidence on effectiveness, can be used as the first step in technology assessment. We analyze the use of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) in the province of Ontario, Canada. The annual number of procedures increased 52 per cent over a seven-year period between 1979 and 1985. Large increases in CABS rates in the over-65 population accounted for more than half of this increase in procedures. Increased rates of surgery in the over-65 population are unlikely to be caused by increased prevalence of coronary artery disease and may be the result of a change in clinical attitude toward the use of CABS. This change is discussed in the context of the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CABS. We conclude that there is a need to carefully monitor and evaluate the use of technologies especially in the elderly.\r"

The overall age-sex adjusted rate of two-year incident home care use was 3.2 per cent. For both men and women, the rates among the aged 85 or older group were approximately 12 times the rates of those aged 65 to 74. The multivariate predictors of incident home care, adjusted for age and sex, were five: receiving help with at least one activity of daily living (ADL), being dependent in Rosow-Breslau functional health areas, being homebound, more errors in mental status items, and no involvement with social groups. The dominance of indicators of frailty in physical function and cognitive function are consistent with the predictors of another group of LTC clients, those who subsequently enter nursing homes. However, in the present study the ratios of medical home care use were similar for those living alone and for those living with others in the multivariate model, suggesting the possibility of differences between home care and institutional LTC clients.\r"

Mice immunized with this Fasciola-derived 12 Kd antigen developed antibodies to Schistosoma mansoni adult worm extracts, demonstrating its cross-reactivity with schistosomes. Vaccination of mice with microgram amounts of the antigen in Freund's adjuvant induced up to 77% reduction in worm burdens after challenge with S. mansoni cercariae. F. hepatica 12 Kd degraded by proteinase K to lower molecular weight polypeptides which still retain their antigenicity as determined by the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot technique. Treatment with either Endoglycosidase H, neuraminidase, or dithiothreitol had no effect on its mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, or in its recognition by antibody, suggesting the absence of carbohydrate moieties or disulphide bonds in relation to its antigenic determinants and also suggesting that the antigen is a pure polypeptide. These studies establish that a molecularly defined cross-reactive component of one parasitic trematode (F. hepatica) induces resistance to challenge infection with another parasitic trematode (S. mansoni). Its polypeptide nature makes recombinant DNA technology an alternative for the manufacture of a vaccine.\r"

Collagen synthesis was estimated by measuring incorporation of 14C-proline into collagenase-sensitive proteins for both culture media and cell layers. Coculture of splenic T cells from infected mice with these hepatic fibroblasts caused greater selective and specific reduction in collagen production than did coculture using spleen cells from normal mice. There was a parallel inhibition in collagen within the cell layer which indicates that the marked decrease in collagen production was due to inhibition of synthesis and not related to changes in solubility or secretion. Primary culture of mouse skin fibroblasts showed similar responses to coculture but an established fibroblast line, 3T3, was unresponsive. Inflammatory cells appear to influence hepatic fibroblasts isolated under our experimental condition in several ways, such as opposite effects on collagen synthesis and cell proliferation.\r"

These antigens were studied by direct gold labeling in which anti-CAA and anti-CCA monoclonal antibodies were labeled with 5 and 15 nm gold particles, respectively. CAA and CCA were demonstrable in glomeruli at week 3 in the basement membrane and from 5 weeks in moderately electron-dense material of the mesangial matrix. Both antigens were also encountered in fenestrae of the endothelial cells, in filtration slit pores, and on the luminal membranes of the epithelial cells. It appears that CAA and CCA are arrested by the glomerular basement membrane and deposited in the mesangial matrix. CAA was seen in considerably smaller amounts than CCA. This was ascribed to the fact that CAA, but not CCA, is repelled by the negative charge of the capillary walls and the glomerular basement membrane.\r"

The effect of metrifonate on cure rate and reduction of infection intensity was limited by both age and pretreatment infection intensity. Rate of improvement from gross hematuria was similar in all ages and in all classes of intensity of infection. Two doses of metrifonate reduced the prevalence of gross hematuria as much as 3 doses did, while the effect of a single dose on morbidity remains to be clarified.\r"

The diagnosis is best established definitively by a wedge biopsy of the liver. The ability of abdominal ultrasonography to diagnose this condition was prospectively compared with two independent pathological examinations of wedge biopsies of the liver. Both pathologists and the ultrasonographer were unaware of the clinical diagnosis and each other's findings. Twenty-eight of 41 patients had Symmers' fibrosis by pathological examination and all were diagnosed correctly by ultrasonography prior to surgery. Symmers' fibrosis was not diagnosed by ultrasound in any of 10 patients without Symmers' fibrosis on biopsy. In 3 patients the diagnosis of Symmers' fibrosis was uncertain because the pathologists disagreed as to its presence. These results confirm the findings of previous studies and establish that ultrasonography is at least as sensitive as wedge biopsy in diagnosing Symmers' fibrosis.\r"

Forty-five (4.1%) of 1,102 schoolchildren and 64 (10.4%) of 618 junior high school students were positive for the skin test with veronal buffered saline-extracted Schistosoma japonicum antigen. None was positive by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, complement fixation test, double diffusion test in agar, and circumoval precipitin test. About one fifth of 356 adult inhabitants showed positive reactions in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and complement fixation test as well as in the skin test, although only 25 individuals (7%) were positive for the circumoval precipitin test. All of 70 individuals who had shown positive reactions in at least two of the immunological tests were negative for a series of 5 stool examinations with the AMS III method. Release of S.japonicum cercariae was not observed in 15,000 O. hupensis nosophora collected in this area. Repeated examinations by dipping mice into irrigation ditches were negative. These observations, with the fact that all of 15 patients reported from nearby hospitals to have schistosome eggs in their tissues were over 45 years old, suggest that schistosomiasis has become a disease of the past in this area.\r"

There was a significant increase in risk factors for decreased mesenteric blood flow in those patients with small bowel necrosis compared with those without this complication. In addition, the other 17 patients with abdominal distention (a manifestation of tube feeding intolerance) had a significantly increased number of risk factors for decreased mesenteric blood flow. Documented low-flow states should prompt discontinuation of tube feedings even in the patient without gastrointestinal symptoms and signs. Distention is a nonspecific but ominous finding and should prompt discontinuation of tube feedings permanently unless a reversible cause for distention is determined.\r"

Neither death appeared directly attributable to gastrostomy placement. The cost for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was less than that of an operative gastrostomy ($757 versus $1,446); however, if endoscopically placed tubes required replacement, as was seen in six patients, total percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy cost increased to $1,198. Definitive conclusions regarding the superiority of one technique over the other cannot be drawn from this data. Trends favoring the use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy merit continued study.\r"

The incidence of radiographically detected abnormal tube position was 1.3 percent. The presence of cuffed tracheostomy or endotracheal tubes did not prevent this occurrence. The institution of enteral feedings should, therefore, be performed according to strict guidelines which include radiographic confirmation of desired position before feedings are initiated, limited and supervised use of stylets, and a need for special precautions in patients who are obtunded or receiving intubated respiratory assistance.\r"

An experimental microvascular model in rats has been developed in our laboratory using Indium-111-labeled platelets to measure the amount of deposition on grafts inserted into the infrarenal aorta. This study was designed to assess the patency rates in these grafts and the pathologic maturation as determined by light and electron microscopy. Our study suggests that substantial patency rates can be achieved in aspirin-treated rats, although there was little influence on the pathologic maturation. Indium-111 oxine-labeled platelets can be used to document platelet aggregation, and the technique can be a valuable adjunct in the study of microvascular grafts.\r"

  ".W": "The results of this study demonstrate that lysine is the major amino acid participating in the binding of acetaldehyde to proteins. The formation of both stable and unstable acetaldehyde-albumin adducts was shown to occur via the reaction of acetaldehyde with lysine residues. This conclusion was based on the following experimental evidence: (a) the ratio of stable to unstable adducts of bovine serum albumin was similar to that observed for polylysine; (b) acetylation of albumin markedly reduced acetaldehyde binding; (c) the radio-activity profiles (obtained by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis) of [14C]acetaldehyde modified amino acids hydrolyzed from total and stable adducts of albumin were nearly identical to those of polylysine or alpha-t-boc-lysine. Analysis of stable adducts of albumin indicated two major modified lysine residues; one residue was much more acidic and the other more basic than unmodified lysine. Unstable adducts were shown to be Schiff bases since NaBH4 treatment resulted in the formation of N-ethyllysine residues. The reducing agents, NaCNBH3 and ascorbic acid, both increased stable adduct formation via increased binding to lysine residues; however, a different elution profile of modified lysine residues was observed for these reducing agents. NaCNBH3 increased the formation of N-ethyllysine residues exclusively, whereas ascorbate increased the formation of the acidic adduct of lysine and also caused the formation of an additional modified lysine residue which was present only in the ascorbate-treated polypeptides. In addition to their detection by radioactivity measurements, the acetaldehyde-lysine adducts could also be detected by the fluorescence of their ophthalaldehyde derivatives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their tracheas were intubated and all received a caudal block to eliminate surgical stimulation. Pneumotachography and capnography were used and in three cases movements of ribcage and abdomen were also studied by magnetometers. Respiratory drive was evaluated by occlusion tests. Ventilation was depressed at an end tidal halothane concentration of 1.5%, with smaller tidal volumes, higher respiratory rates, higher end tidal carbon dioxide tensions and a weaker respiratory drive compared with 1.0% and 0.5% halothane. Paradoxical breathing was noted at 1.5% as well as at 1.0% but not at 0.5% halothane anaesthesia; the ribcage moved inwards during inspiration. Respiratory compensation during periods of 4% carbon dioxide stimulation was inadequate at 1.5% halothane, as indicated by higher end tidal carbon dioxide tensions, less negative occlusion pressures and movements of ribcage and abdomen that were unresponsive to 4% carbon dioxide, when compared with 1.0% and 0.5% halothane. Respiratory rates were higher and duration of inspiration longer at 1.5% than at 1.0% and 0.5% halothane. Respiratory timing was unaltered by carbon dioxide stimulation. It is concluded that the ventilatory motor response to carbon dioxide is dose dependent and improves at more superficial anaesthetic levels, while respiratory timing is unresponsive to carbon dioxide stimulation irrespective of the halothane concentration used. Paradoxical breathing existed at end tidal halothane concentrations higher than 1%.\r"

In five dogs, the effects of 65% nitrous oxide (N2O) inspired and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were also examined. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.66 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min for a total dose of 40 mg.kg-1. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured by venous outflow technique) both decreased until a plateau level was reached at approximately 75% of control values (4.0 +/- 0.2 ml.min-1.100 g-1 and 49 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1, respectively, mean +/- SEM). This occurred after 6-10 mg.kg-1 of midazolam, corresponding to serum midazolam levels between 18.4 +/- 3.8 and 31.2 +/- 3.3 micrograms.ml-1. Serum midazolam levels increased throughout the midazolam infusion, reaching a mean value of 53 +/- 5.5 micrograms.ml-1 by the end of the midazolam infusion. A similar plateau was seen for changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which never developed burst suppression. Five dogs inspired 65% nitrous oxide/35% oxygen during minutes 30-45 of the midazolam infusion, rather than 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. Nitrous oxide had no effect upon CMRO2, but significantly increased CBF when compared to dogs receiving nitrogen. Ro 15-1788, 1.0 mg.kg-1 caused a return of CMRO2 and EEG activity to control levels. CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP) increased markedly, to greater than control levels immediately following Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was undertaken to compare the effects of cold crystalloid and blood cardioplegia on the functional recovery of the heart; on Ca++ binding and uptake, Ca++-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and sarcolemmal (SL) ATPase; and on serum MB fraction of creatine kinase (MBCK) after one and half hours of reperfusion following one hour of ischemic cardiac arrest in dog. This study was made also to determine if the functional changes are related to the changes in biochemistry at the molecular level. The dogs were divided into three groups: sham bypass (SB), cold crystalloid cardioplegia (CC), and pump blood cardioplegia (PB). There was a decrease in the cardiac index (CI), left ventricular work index (LVWI), and mean aortic pressure (MAP) in all three groups. The index of myocardial contractility [dp/dt)/IIP) and CI were lower in the CC group as compared with the SB and PB groups. All the hemodynamic values for the PB group were similar to those of the SB group except total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) which were lower in the PB group. The index of myocardial contractility and cardiac index appeared to be greater in the PB group than in the CC group. There was a decrease in the Ca++ uptake by SR from both the CC and PB groups. Ca++ binding and Ca++,-ATPase of SR from the PB group were depressed. The sarcolemmal ATPase was unaffected in both groups. The serum MBCK increased in both PB and CC groups, though the increase was smaller in the PB group. These results indicate that the functional recovery of the heart was slightly better with pump blood cardioplegia than with cold crystalloid cardioplegia. The depressed myocardial contractility and cardiac function in the CC group were associated with a decrease in the Ca++ uptake by SR. However, the decreases in the Ca++ binding, Ca++ uptake, and Ca++ ATPase by SR from the pump blood cardioplegic group were not accompanied by decreases in the cardiac contractility and cardiac function. Myocardial damage as assessed by serum MBCK was smaller in the PB group than in the CC group.\r"

The patients were randomized and treated for seven days with either 60 mg terfenadine twice daily, morning and evening, and a placebo at noon, or with 4 mg chlorpheniramine or placebo three times daily. The severity of nasopharyngeal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and itchy, watery, red eyes was ranked daily by patients and evaluated before and after treatment by the physician investigators. The patients reported a significant reduction in symptoms within one day. The physician investigators detected moderate to complete relief of symptoms in a greater proportion of the patients treated with terfenadine (70%) and chlorpheniramine (73%) than in the placebo-treated patients (48%). The incidence of sedation with terfenadine treatment (2.5%) was not different from that with placebo (2.4%) and both were lower than with chlorpheniramine (7.6%). We conclude that terfenadine is as effective as chlorpheniramine for the treatment of fall hay fever and that, unlike chlorpheniramine, the incidence of sedation with terfenadine was not different from placebo.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the in vivo response of the canine peripheral lung to 1 ppm ozone is mediated, in part, by histamine and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism. Ozone was delivered for 5 min to lobar segments through a wedged bronchoscope and resulted in a mean (+/- 1 SE) increase in collateral system resistance (Rcs) of 220.7 +/- 13.8% immediately after exposure. Four 5-min exposures of ozone to the same segments over a 3-h period yielded reproducible Rcs responses, i.e., tolerance to the exposure regimen was not exhibited. Analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the isolated segment 1 min after a single exposure to ozone indicated significant increases, compared with control, in mean concentrations of PGD2 (135.3 +/- 33.3 pg/ml versus 47.8 +/- 16.0; p less than 0.025) and histamine (1.43 +/- 0.19 ng/ml versus 1.18 +/- 0.17; p less than 0.05). Additionally, a molecule that exhibited high reactivity with LTB4 antibody was found in greater concentrations in ozone-exposed segments compared to controls (821.5 +/- 206.7 pg/ml versus 437.5 +/- 78.8; p less than 0.05). In contrast, the concentration of TxB2 was not significantly greater in ozone-exposed segments compared to controls (37.2 +/- 6.6 pg/ml versus 33.7 +/- 10.3; p less than 0.05). Cyclooxygenase inhibition (indomethacin, 5 mg/kg, IV) significantly inhibited the Rcs response by 32% (p less than 0.05) and histamine H1-receptor blockade (chlorpheniramine maleate, 5 mg/kg, IV) reduced the response by 30% (p less than 0.05). However, blockade of thromboxane synthetase (UK-37,248, 3 mg/kg, IV) had no significant effect on the ozone-induced response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether acute short-term exposure to oxidant pollutants can cause changes in respiratory mechanics, we gave 0.5 ppm ozone for 5 min to 7 baboons. We measured pulmonary resistance (RL) and obtained dose response curves to methacholine before and after the exposures. This brief insult increased resistance (control RL = 1.53 +/- 0.21 cm H2O.L-1 s; post-ozone RL = 3.53 +/- 0.54 cm H2O.L-1 s). On a second occasion, 6 of these animals were restudied before and after the administration of cromolyn sodium. Although this drug had no effect on the measurements of mechanics made in the control period, it significantly reduced the ozone-induced changes in mechanics. The increase in RL was 52% of that produced in the first study. The results demonstrated that the ozone injury with its acute and subacute airway sequelae occurs quite rapidly and after very brief exposure. The time course of the change in mechanics and the effects of cromolyn suggest the hypothesis that surface epithelial cells are disrupted, causing subsequent release of bronchoconstricting agents.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential lung injuries, such as oxygen toxicity followed by septicemia, are common during the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As these forms of vascular injury may be mediated in part by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), aberrant interactions between PMN and previously injured pulmonary endothelium are of both theoretical interest and clinical importance. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that early oxygen toxicity at a dose that injuries pulmonary endothelium relatively selectively alters intrapulmonary neutrophil kinetics. Unanesthetized rats breathing 1.0 atmospheres oxygen for 36 h showed ultrastructural endothelial damage but no edema, injury, or neutrophilic inflammation by histologic criteria. However, in these oxygen-toxic animals, whereas initial accumulation of radiolabeled PMN in lungs was normal, washout of PMN was abnormal at 120 min after infusion, at which point the pulmonary retention of radiolabeled PMN in the lungs of oxygen-treated animals was significantly higher than in control animals (139% of control, p less than 0.0096). Features of our methodology, including avoidance of osmotic stress and use of paired control animals, appear to have greatly enhanced the sensitivity of radiolabeled neutrophils for detecting a subtle abnormality of neutrophil-endothelial interactions. Our studies in the oxygen toxicity model provide the first demonstration in vivo of abnormal intrapulmonary neutrophil kinetics in early oxygen toxicity prior to the onset of histologic evidence of lung injury or inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Study Objective: To determine the efficacy of a 6-month course of combination chemotherapy with hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (H-CAP) in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Design: Prospective, non-randomized, single-institution trial with a 6-month course of chemotherapy, followed by second-look laparotomy for restaging. Minimum follow-up after completion of therapy is 83 months. Patients: Fifty-five patients with advanced (stage III or IV), intermediate- or high-grade epithelial carcinoma of the ovary. Twenty patients had limited residual tumor (3 cm or less maximal tumor diameter) after initial cytoreductive surgery; 35 had extensive residual disease. Interventions: All patients received chemotherapy with hexamethylmelamine (150 mg/m2 body surface area orally on days 1 to 14), cyclophosphamide (350 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8), doxorubicin (20 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8), and cisplatin (60 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1). Courses were repeated at 4-week intervals; 41 patients (75%) received six courses; 10 patients received five courses, 3 patients received four courses, and 1 patients received three courses. Forty-seven patients underwent second-look laparotomy after completion of therapy; 8 had their disease restaged clinically. Results: Fifty-three of fifty-five patients (96%) had either partial or complete response to treatment. Nineteen of forty-seven patients who had a second-look laparotomy had a surgically documented complete response; 17 of these 19 patients began chemotherapy with limited residual tumor. Ten patients (18%) remain disease-free 83 to 108 months after therapy, whereas three additional patients died of other diseases without clinical evidence of recurrent ovarian cancer. Nine of twenty patients who began chemotherapy with limited residual tumor remain disease-free, as compared to only 1 of 35 patients with more extensive tumor (P less than 0.001). All long-term, disease-free survivors had surgically documented complete response at second-look laparotomy. Conclusions: Treatment with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy after aggressive cytoreductive surgery should be considered standard treatment for advanced ovarian carcinoma. Our intensive, 6-month course of treatment produced results comparable to those previously reported with prolonged treatment.\r"

The level could be categorized as high (greater than 100 pg/mL) or low (15 to 65 pg/mL). Three patients with anti-p24 antibody had no antigenemia. Zidovudine (AZT), 200 or 250 mg every 4 hours, reduced antigenemia by about 90%; other regimens were less effective. Leukocyte cultures were positive for HIV from patients with antigenemia, and in one third of samples in the absence of antigenemia. High levels of antigenemia correlated with symptoms, CD4 cell count, and prognosis. Drug toxicity requiring a lower dose was followed by increased antigenemia, recurrent symptoms, and decreased CD4 cells, suggesting lymphocyte toxicity. Monitoring antigenemia can be useful in evaluating patients with HIV infection and in evaluating the effect of antiviral chemotherapy.\r"

Annual colonoscopy with biopsies for 99 patients with pancolitis and a mean duration of disease at entry of 17 years was evaluated. The outcomes of mucosal dysplasia or cancer were analyzed to determine the annual risk (hazard rate) of high-grade dysplasia or colon cancer. The hazard rates were used to recommend screening intervals. The delay in the diagnosis of cancer is minimized for any given number of tests when the time between tests is inversely proportional to the square root of the hazard rate. Since the hazard rate for cancer increases with duration of disease, intervals for screening tests should not be uniform. For a range of reasonable marginal benefits from additional testing, the number of tests recommended is less than the number of tests done in fixed-interval screening programs. Scheduling screening tests using patient-specific hazard rates to minimize the delay in the diagnosis of cancer reduces the number of colonoscopies, associated cost, and morbidity.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 9-month treatment period. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who did not have normal glucose control with diet alone. INTERVENTIONS: Once-per-day NPH insulin and placebo glyburide, or glyburide and once-per-day placebo insulin injection. Active drug and placebo adjusted in parallel to achieve fasting plasma glucose level less than 6.4 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) without hypoglycemia. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Insulin and glyburide produced similar improvement in fasting blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c concentrations, similar frequencies of mild symptomatic hypoglycemia, and similar weight gain despite dietary reinforcement. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ratios of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol increased in both groups, with a significantly greater improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ratio of high-density lipoprotein total cholesterol in patients treated with insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with glyburide or once-per-day NPH insulin provides a similar degree of glucose control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin may have a relative advantage in that it is associated with higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a higher ratio of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol.\r"

Hypometabolic zones were visualized in 25 patients (81%). Cortical lCMRGlc in hypometabolic zones was within 2 standard deviations of the mean for normal temporal cortex in all but 8 patients. However, in 24 patients asymmetry between the hypometabolic cortex and homologous contralateral cortex was more than 2 standard deviations above the mean cortical asymmetry for normals. There was good correlation between hypometabolic zones and electroencephalogram (EEG) foci in patients with unilateral well-defined EEG foci. Diffuse or shifting EEG abnormalities were often associated with normal PET scans. Of 28 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 10 showed focal temporal lobe abnormalities corresponding to focal hypometabolism. While the [18F]FDG PET scan cannot currently localize an epileptogenic zone independently, the absence of focal hypometabolism or its presence contralateral to a presumed EEG focus suggests the need for additional electrophysiological data.\r"

COX activity was also decreased in liver of 3 patients (2 to 13% of normal) and in cultured fibroblasts of 2 patients (18 and 27%), but it was normal in both liver and fibroblasts from 1 patient. Immunotitration using polyclonal antibodies against human heart COX showed essentially normal amounts of cross-reacting enzyme protein in various tissues from different patients. Electrophoresis of COX immunoprecipitated from brain mitochondrial extracts showed normal patterns of COX subunits in 2 patients.

  ".W": "Neurofibrillary tangles occur in a number of apparently distinct neurodegenerative diseases and in normal aging of the human brain. Antibodies raised against Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments immunolabel the tangles seen in all other tangle-associated disorders examined to date. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau, has recently been identified as an antigenic component of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites in Alzheimer's disease. Three different polyclonal antibodies with strong tau immunoreactivity are examined in this study. These antibodies were found to immunostain tangles in normal aged brain and in brains affected by a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease plus Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, as well as Pick bodies in Pick's disease. The findings further illustrate the relative nonspecificity of neurofibrillary lesions in neurodegenerative disorders.\r"

Measured by recovery of test organisms from endocardial lesions, the lowest-concentration inoculum was infective for 53% of the recipients; the higher-concentration inocula were infective for all recipients. A single-oral-dose penicillin V regimen (36 mg/kg of body weight) prevented endocarditis when rabbits were challenged with 10(4) CFU, but protection diminished with increasing inoculum concentrations. In contrast, addition of a second penicillin V dose (18 mg/kg of body weight) administered with a 7-h interval between doses achieved fully effective prophylaxis against even the highest inoculum tested (10(8) CFU). A repeated set of experiments in which half the dose of penicillin V was administered showed significantly reduced protection against S. sanguis endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "Beginning in 1985, relatively penicillin G-resistant (Penr) meningococci which did not produce beta-lactamase were isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients in Spain. We identified 16 Penr (mean MIC, 0.3 microgram/ml; range, 0.1 to 0.7 microgram/ml) and 12 penicillin-susceptible (Pens; mean MIC, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) strains of Neisseria meningitidis by the agar dilution technique using an inoculum of 10(4) CFU and questioned which disk susceptibility test would best differentiate these two populations. We compared the disk susceptibility of these strains using disks containing 2 (P2) and 10 (P10) U of penicillin G, 2 (Am2) and 10 (Am10) micrograms of ampicillin, and 1 microgram of oxacillin (OX1). We also investigated susceptibility with disks containing 30 micrograms of each of cephalothin (CF30), cefoxitin (FOX30), cefuroxime (CXM30), and cefotaxime (CTX30) and 75 micrograms of cefoperazone (CFP75) and determined by cluster analysis any correlation with the zone diameters obtained with P2 disks. Using the P2 and AM2 disks (in contrast to the P10 and AM10 disks), we correctly differentiated all the Penr from Pens isolates. In addition, the zone diameters with the P2 disk gave the best correlation with the penicillin G MIC determinations. All 16 Penr strains and 3 of 12 Pens strains showed zone diameters of 6 mm around OX1 disks, limiting the usefulness of OX1 disks. The zone diameters obtained with CF30, CXM30, and OX1 disks correlated with those obtained with the P2 disk, which suggests that these antibiotics have similar effects on these strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A47934, a peptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces toyocaensis, belongs to the glycopeptide class of compounds which includes ristocetin and vancomycin. Incorporation studies with radioisotope-labeled substrates indicated that tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylglycine, p-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate, acetate, and sulfate were efficiently incorporated into A47934. This is consistent with the reported biosynthesis of other glycopeptide antibiotics. Prototrophic mutants blocked in antibiotic biosynthesis were isolated at a low frequency (0.4%) after mutagenesis. Secretor-convertor pairings of the 36 mutants obtained demonstrated that they belonged to three classes: two groups of secretor-convertor pairs and a larger group of mutants that did not make antibiotic under any condition tested. Neither the secretor-convertor studies not supplementation of the cultures with putative biosynthetic intermediates was useful in identifying the location of the biosynthetic blocks. All studies to determine the timing of the sulfate addition step in the biosynthesis indicated that the sulfate is added prior to the formation of intermediates that possess antimicrobial activity.\r"

  ".U": "88132674\r", 
  ".W": "The quinone antibiotic streptonigrin is believed to kill bacteria by promoting formation of oxygen radicals. This antibiotic has also been used to select resistant bacterial mutants, some of which vary in iron utilization. We examined the effects of streptonigrin on Neisseria gonorrhoeae and several types of gonococcal mutants. Streptonigrin (0.025 microgram/ml) efficiently killed gonococcal strain FA1090, and this effect depended on iron. Streptonigrin-resistant mutant FA6271 had normal iron uptake but was moderately deficient in total iron. Resistance most likely resulted from failure of FA6271 to divert electrons to streptonigrin, as demonstrated by a reduction in KCN-insensitive respiration (a hallmark of the action of quinones) and superoxide formation. Other mutants selected for inability to use human iron-binding proteins (strains FA6273 and FA6275) had no increase in streptonigrin MIC and no decrease in KCN-insensitive respiration. Mutants did not demonstrate an increase in superoxide dismutase or catalase. Streptonigrin killing of gonococci depended on a reaction(s) in which extracellular iron was important, presumably because iron was required for catalysis of hydroxyl radical. The results suggest that a membrane component may be a target for the actions of streptonigrin.\r"

The isolates were obtained from 70 patients who had been treated with netilmicin as the only antipseudomonal antibiotic. Clinically, 83% of the patients were cured or improved, and 64% of the Pseudomonas isolates were eliminated by chemotherapy. The 74 clinical isolates and 38 additional isolates with known mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance were tested in three separate laboratories by disk diffusion methods and by microdilution tests with three broth media (Mueller-Hinton broth with full, half, and no cation supplements). Isolates that responded to netilmicin therapy and those that failed to respond were all susceptible by the disk test, and most were susceptible by microdilution tests with unsupplemented broth. However, over half of the clinical isolates appeared to be resistant when cations were added to the broth medium. Strains capable of producing enzymes that inactivate netilmicin were resistant by all methods tested. Broth dilution and agar dilution results were most comparable when half of the recommended cation supplements was added to Mueller-Hinton broth. Further consideration should be given to reducing the concentration of cations that are added to Mueller-Hinton broth when netilmicin susceptibility tests are being performed. However, additional studies with other aminoglycosides are needed before appropriate testing conditions can be standardized.\r"

Disk diffusion tests were performed according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards with two different media (Mueller-Hinton agar and chocolate Mueller-Hinton agar) and plates incubated under two atmospheric conditions (ambient air and 5 to 7% CO2). Optimum disk diffusion test results were obtained with Mueller-Hinton agar plates incubated in ambient air with all eight antimicrobial agents. On the basis of comparisons of MICs versus zones of inhibition, the following zone diameter interpretive criteria were defined for testing B. catarrhalis with disks containing 10 micrograms of ampicillin: greater than or equal to 38 mm, susceptible; 20 to 37 mm, moderately susceptible; less than or equal to 19 mm, resistant. The respective MIC correlates were less than or equal to 0.06, 0.125 to 0.5, and greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Because of the absence of frankly resistant test organisms, it was not possible to make definitive recommendations pertaining to disk diffusion tests with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalothin, cefaclor, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Evidence is presented, however, which suggests that the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk diffusion interpretive criteria for nonfastidious bacteria can be applied to B. catarrhalis, at least as they pertain to the susceptible category with cephalothin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. With cefaclor, a zone diameter of greater than or equal to 21 mm was determined to adequately define the susceptible category.\r"

  ".W": "Sinefungin, a natural nucleoside isolated from cultures of Streptomyces incarnatus and S. griseolus, is structurally related to S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine. Sinefungin has been shown to inhibit the development of various fungi and viruses, but its major attraction to date resides in its potent antiparasitic activity. This compound has been reported to display antiparasitic activity against malarial, trypanosomal, and leishmanial species. Very little is known about the antiparasitic mode of action of sinefungin. We found that S-adenosylmethionine was capable of reversing the inhibitory growth effects of sinefungin in Leishmania mexicana and that dATP was capable of reversing inhibitory effects of the drug on DNA polymerase activity when pyrophosphate release was measured. However, when incorporation of [3H]dTTP was used to measure DNA polymerase activity, no inhibition could be observed. Inhibition of DNA polymerase activity by sinefungin occurred only during the initial stages of purification of this enzyme, and inhibition by aphidicolin, a known DNA polymerase inhibitor, paralleled the inhibition by sinefungin. Neither sinefungin nor aphidicolin inhibited partially purified DNA polymerase. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase was partially purified, and sinefungin, at levels active in vitro, had no significant effect. Sinefungin was significantly suppressive against both L. donovani and L. braziliensis panamensis infections in hamsters when compared with meglumine antimonate (Glucantime).\r"

Posttreatment follow-up for patients with acute osteomyelitis was continued for at least 6 months, while follow-up for at least 12 months was done for patients with chronic osteomyelitis. A regimen of 2 g of ceftazidime intravenously every 12 h was used for most patients. The overall cure rates were 77% (acute disease) and 60% (chronic disease). Development of resistance to ceftazidime was not problematic, and the drug was well tolerated. Ceftazidime is effective for serious gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis, including that due to P. aeruginosa. The twice-daily regimen did not cause major organ toxicity, eliminating the need for concentration monitoring and making it feasible to use the drug for home parenteral therapy.\r"
