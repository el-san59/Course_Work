  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed as primary therapy in 215 consecutive patients (aged 56 +/- 11 years, 75% male) with acute myocardial infarction and single vessel coronary artery disease. Wide patency of the infarct-related artery was restored in 212 patients (99%). Complications consisted of one urgent coronary bypass operation (0.5%); there were no procedural deaths. A recurrent ischemic event before discharge occurred in eight patients (4%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 1%; five of six patients presenting with cardiogenic shock were alive at discharge. In 126 patients in whom predischarge angiography was performed, the ejection fraction improved from 55 +/- 12% to 61 +/- 12% (p less than 0.005) and increased by greater than or equal to 5% units in 66 patients (52%). Regional wall motion improved in 60 patients (48%). By multivariate analysis, a depressed initial ejection fraction, a limited increase in serum creatine kinase, young age and sustained patency of the infarct-related artery were found to be independent predictors of improvement in left ventricular function. Follow-up data were available in 214 patients (99.5%) at a mean interval of 35 months. The actuarial 3 year cardiac survival rate was 92%. By multivariate analysis, only the baseline ejection fraction correlated with long-term cardiac survival. Nine patients (4%) sustained a late nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 11 patients (5%) underwent subsequent coronary bypass surgery. At late follow-up study, 149 (77%) of 194 patients alive were free of angina. In summary, in patients with acute myocardial infarction and single vessel disease, coronary angioplasty without prior thrombolytic therapy can be performed with a high success rate and few procedural complications. After direct angioplasty, regional wall motion and global ejection fraction improve in 50% of patients, especially in those with depressed initial left ventricular function. This approach results in an excellent early and late event-free survival.\r"

Patients with significant coronary artery disease (greater than 30% stenosis in any vessel) were excluded. In 8 of the 21 patients in whom preoperative ventriculograms were available, regional wall motion was normal before valve replacement. Although average radial shortening (35.6 +/- 4.8% versus 35.3 +/- 3.8%, p = NS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (62.8 +/- 4.2% versus 57.9 +/- 2.8%, p = NS) were unchanged in the preoperative and postoperative studies of these eight patients, radial shortening in the vicinity of insertion of the posteromedial papillary muscle declined significantly (38.4 +/- 6.4% to 20.8 +/- 4.4%, p less than 0.04). Postoperative radial shortening for all 21 patients at the site of insertion of the papillary muscle was also reduced to a significant degree compared with the average radial shortening (32.9 +/- 10.3% versus 17.5 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.001). The findings demonstrate significant long-term and possibly permanent regional ventricular dysfunction after severing the chordae tendineae during mitral valve replacement.\r"

Long-term relative survival rates were analyzed in a consecutive series of 2,805 Swedish patients who, on the basis of clinical symptoms, underwent aortic valve replacement (n = 1,741), mitral valve replacement (n = 792) and double (aortic plus mitral) valve replacement (n = 272) between 1969 and 1983. The follow-up period, which closed August 1, 1985, included 100% of patients and covered 16,822 patient-years. Autopsy was performed in 75% of all deaths. The results underscore previously well known differences between the long-term survival after aortic valve replacement and mitral or double valve replacement, whereas no differences were noted between mitral and double valve replacement. Within the subgroup undergoing aortic valve replacement, analysis of relative survival rates disclosed a highly significant (p less than 0.001) difference between patients operated on for aortic stenosis and those operated on for aortic regurgitation, representing a mortality rate more than twice as high in the latter group. This difference was of much lesser magnitude when analyzed in the standard (actuarial) way. With a low (less than 2.5%) operative mortality rate for patients undergoing isolated elective aortic valve replacement in the current era and with an acceptable incidence of late valve-related death (5.2% at 10 years), these results may justify aortic valve replacement earlier in the course of chronic aortic regurgitation to prevent irreversible myocardial damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the frequency and degree of valvular regurgitation in combined heart and lung transplant recipients, 50 patients were investigated using Doppler color flow echocardiography 20 to 909 days (mean 369) after heart-lung transplantation. The mean age (+/- SD) of the patients was 25 +/- 9 years. No patient had evidence of rejection at the time of the study. Fifty normal volunteers acted as control subjects. Tricuspid, mitral and pulmonary regurgitation were commonly observed in the patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation (78%, 52% and 68%, respectively), but were not significantly more frequent than in the normal subjects (68%, 42% and 70%, respectively). Aortic regurgitation was uncommon in both groups (4% and 2%, respectively). However, tricuspid and mitral regurgitant jet areas were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in heart-lung transplant recipients than in normal subjects (156 +/- 120 and 84 +/- 52 mm2 compared with 40 +/- 38 and 28 +/- 26 mm2, respectively); pulmonary regurgitant jet area was not significantly different in the two groups (32 +/- 26 and 28 +/- 26 mm2, respectively). Regurgitant jet area was not significantly correlated with patient or donor age, donor organ total ischemic time, time after operation, use of steroids for immunosuppression or total number of rejection episodes. These results show that valvular regurgitation is not significantly more frequent after heart-lung transplantation than in normal subjects, but atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, when present, is significantly greater in degree. This suggests that the degree but not the frequency of AV valve regurgitation is related to transplantation.\r"

Seventeen (47%) continued to have ischemia that was limited in 12 to exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities, which were less severe compared with those of preangioplasty studies. Fifteen (65%) of 23 patients had improvement in rest wall motion abnormalities after angioplasty. The rest to immediate postexercise change in global wall motion score was significantly improved after angioplasty. The change in regional wall motion score was significantly improved after angioplasty in patients with single vessel right or left circumflex coronary artery disease and approached significant improvement (p = 0.06) in those with single vessel disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Exercise echocardiography improves the sensitivity of functional testing for ischemia, aids in localizing the ischemic zone and documents improvement in regional function after coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography is quantitatively reproducible, repeated intracoronary injections of sonicated albumin (5%) were performed in eight open chest dogs. Paired injections were performed at baseline, during ischemia produced by ligation of a coronary artery, and during hyperemia induced by intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg/kg body weight of dipyridamole. Contrast washout curves were generated for the left anterior descending coronary artery territory (ischemic area) and left circumflex coronary artery territory (nonischemic area) by beat per beat analysis of frozen end-diastolic frames of left ventricular short-axis views. Peak contrast intensity, contrast washout half-time and area under the curve were derived from these curves. A total of 75 contrast washout curves were analyzed for the study of interinjection, intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. The correlation coefficients between measurements obtained from paired injections of the echocardiographic contrast agent (interinjection reproducibility) ranged from 0.78 for peak contrast intensity to 0.87 for area under the curve. Percent error varied between 14.7% and 24.7%. The intraobserver variability in measurements was less than the interinjection variability, with a cumulative mean percent error of 17.8% and correlation coefficients of 0.72 (peak contrast intensity), 0.95 (area under the curve) and 0.96 (washout half-time). Interobserver correlation for all indexes was high (r = 0.92 to 0.96). It is concluded that peak contrast intensity, contrast washout half-time and the area under the curve derived from myocardial contrast washout curves can be measured reproducibly from videotapes. In addition, the variability between two injections attempted under identical conditions is greater than reader variability from videotapes.\r"

  ".W": "A new nongeometric echocardiographic technique for measurement of right and left ventricular volumes was recently validated in vitro. With this method, all images are taken from one point on the chest wall as the transducer is tilted through the ventricle. This approach offers several advantages. No geometric assumptions about ventricular shape are made. All images are acquired from the best echocardiographic window. Furthermore, the digitized points can be used to make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the ventricle. The present study addresses the clinical feasibility of imaging the heart from a single pivoting point in short axis and compares the accuracy of the method in determining left ventricular volumes with that of biplane cineangiography. Twenty-four patients underwent echocardiographic studies within 2 h before angiography. At catheterization, volumes determined by the biplane area-length method ranged between 95 and 368 ml at end-diastole and between 15 and 303 ml at end-systole. A good correlation was observed between ventricular volumes by angiography and echocardiography at end-diastole and end-systole (r = 0.92 and 0.96, respectively). Correlations between volumes by the two techniques were equally good in patients with wall motion abnormalities (n = 13; r = 0.97). Ventricular ejection fraction ranged between 18% and 84% at angiography and correlated well with echocardiographic measurements (r = 0.82). Thus, the echocardiographic tilt method provides accurate determination of left ventricular volume and ejection fraction. This nongeometric method offers the potential for the determination of right ventricular volume and three-dimensional display of the heart.\r"

Accordingly, serial ECGs (mean 8 days apart), derived from 10 s samples digitized at 250 Hz, were examined in 78 patients with no intercurrent change in clinical status. The coefficient of variation was calculated as 1 SD of the difference between paired voltage measurements, divided by the average mean value. Coefficient of variation for single leads was 22.3% for SV1, 27.0% for RV5 or RV6, 27.1% for RaVL and 34.7% for SV3. Coefficient of variation was lower for voltage combinations than for individual lead measurements: 18.5% for Sokolow-Lyon voltage (SV1 + RV5 or RV6), 22.3% for Gubner-Ungerleider voltage (R1 + S3) and 24.8% for Cornell voltage (RaVL + SV3). Serial reclassification due to variation above and below standard criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy occurred in only 3% of patients for Sokolow-Lyon voltage and 4% of patients for Cornell voltage in this group. Minute to minute reproducibility of voltage was assessed with electrodes in place in a separate group of 26 patients, and the coefficient of variation was 2.6% for Sokolow-Lyon voltage, 5.9% for Gubner-Ungerleider voltage and 2.9% for Cornell voltage. These data indicate that serial variability of computer-measured ECG voltage combinations is high, due primarily to changes in lead placement and body position, but less than the variability of computer-measured voltage in individual leads.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for intermittent bundle branch block are still under debate. The role of the time-dependent behavior of the slow calcium channel has recently been emphasized. To test this hypothesis and ascertain the possible involvement of the fast sodium channel, the effects of the slow calcium channel blocker verapamil and the fast sodium channel blocker procainamide were compared in 10 patients with intermittent bundle branch block. All 10 patients showed bundle branch block during spontaneous sinus rhythm. Maneuvers to slow cardiac rate (that is, carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver) were performed to identify normal conduction as well as phase 4 bundle branch block. Thus, the ranges of diastolic intervals (RR) resulting in phase 3 (tachycardia-dependent) bundle branch block, phase 4 (bradycardia-dependent) bundle branch block and normal conduction were measured in two control studies performed before intravenous administration of verapamil (control 1) and procainamide (control 2) and at the peak effect of both drugs. In the control studies, all 10 patients showed phase 3 bundle branch block, whereas phase 4 bundle branch block occurred in only 4 patients. The ranges of phase 3 bundle branch block, phase 4 bundle branch block and normal conduction were very similar in control studies 1 and 2. The phase 3 bundle branch block range was slightly shortened by verapamil (983 +/- 83.5 ms in control 1; 930 +/- 69.4 ms at the peak effect of verapamil), whereas phase 4 bundle branch block remained unchanged. In contrast, conduction was systematically worsened by procainamide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were classified into three groups on the basis of prestudy symptoms: group I, 15 asymptomatic patients; group II, 10 patients with infrequent symptoms but no documented arrhythmias; and group III, 17 patients with one documented episode of supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, or both. At electrophysiologic study, the number of patients with short anterograde accessory pathway effective refractory periods and rapid ventricular responses during induced atrial fibrillation did not differ statistically among the three groups. During a mean follow-up period of 7.5 +/- 4.9 years, 11 of the 42 patients had documented arrhythmias: 2 patients from group II and 2 patients from group III had supraventricular tachycardia and 7 patients from group III had atrial fibrillation. All nine patients from group III with subsequent arrhythmias had had clinical atrial fibrillation before study. No patient from group I had an arrhythmia during follow-up. There were no episodes of ventricular fibrillation or sudden cardiac death during follow-up in any of the patients. The only predischarge variables that correlated with the subsequent occurrence of arrhythmias were a history of documented arrhythmias before electrophysiologic study (p less than 0.01) and inducible supraventricular tachycardia at electrophysiologic study (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although, ideally, left ventricular function should be used to assess the hemodynamic state, right ventricular pulse pressure can be assessed in humans on a long-term basis with a transvenous lead. The potential utility of right ventricular pulse pressure to assess hemodynamic stability was studied in 22 patients with induced ventricular arrhythmias. Right ventricular pressure was measured with use of a transvenous right ventricular endocardial pacing lead with a piezoelectric bender pressure sensor 3 cm from its tip. Single ventricular premature paced beats administered in up to a bigeminal frequency did not alter the mean right ventricular pulse pressure (control 33.7 +/- 26, bigeminy 35.7 +/- 26 mm Hg). Twenty-one episodes of induced ventricular tachycardia were studied in the electrophysiology laboratory. Five seconds after tachycardia induction, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia had a longer cycle length (294 +/- 41 ms) and the right ventricular pulse pressure ratio was higher (0.55 +/- 0.26) than that in unstable ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 256 +/- 55 ms, p = 0.06; pulse pressure ratio 0.26 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.05). Twenty episodes of ventricular fibrillation were induced in eight patients. One second after induction, right ventricular pulse pressure decreased from 25 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). On the first beat after defibrillation, right ventricular pulse pressure increased to 24 +/- 14 mm Hg, a level not significantly different from that before the induction of ventricular fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heart rate was maintained at 10 to 15 beats/min above the sinus rate at rest, and relaxation was assessed during atrial pacing, AV pacing and repeat atrial pacing. The patients were classified into two groups.

Group 2 included 15 patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction or akinesia of one or more left ventricular segments on the contrast ventriculogram, or both.

  ".W": "To study the cardiac determinants of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension, left ventricular mass, fractional shortening and end-systolic wall stress were measured echocardiographically in 36 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. The patients were classified into two groups. Group I consisted of 15 patients with subnormal end-systolic wall stress, and Group II consisted of 21 patients with normal end-systolic wall stress. There were no significant differences between groups in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. After treatment for 4.4 +/- 1.7 years, echocardiographic studies were repeated. There were no significant differences between groups in the duration of the follow-up period and the kinds of antihypertensive drugs. After treatment, blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups (p less than 0.001 for both), with no significant difference between groups. Left ventricular mass increased significantly in Group I (from 331 +/- 7 to 363 +/- 24 g, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05), whereas it decreased significantly in Group II (from 318 +/- 16 to 268 +/- 17 g, p less than 0.001). Myocardial contractility (the relation between end-systolic wall stress and fractional shortening) remained almost the same as before treatment. In conclusion, in patients with hypertensive ventricular hypertrophy with subnormal end-systolic wall stress (inappropriate hypertrophy, probably induced by a neurohumoral factor), a decrease in blood pressure with antihypertensive treatment does not lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, but rather to an increase in left ventricular mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most common lesions were atrial septal defect (81%), ventricular septal defect (61%) and patent ductus arteriosus (85%). Most ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus were large. Valvular dysplasia of one or more valves, graded as mild in most cases, was found in 68%, but was not associated with Doppler evidence of significant regurgitation or stenosis in any subject. Of the four valves, the pulmonary valve, followed by the tricuspid valve, was the most commonly dysplastic. Doppler evidence suggestive of elevated pulmonary artery pressure (low velocity bidirectional flow across the ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus), although expected, was accompanied by greater than normal mean right ventricular cavity and free wall dimensions in these patients. Thus, although the cardiac anomalies most frequently encountered in trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 are nonlethal, the combined findings of frequent cyanosis and increased right ventricular dimensions suggest that other factors such as pulmonary hypertension, perhaps related to maldevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature, may contribute to early death in some of these infants.\r"

  ".W": "Five variations of atrial septal morphology occur in hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One variety, termed anomalous attachment of septum primum, has been described only in necropsy series. Two-dimensional echocardiography was utilized to determine the incidence of this anomaly in patients with left atrioventricular (AV) valve underdevelopment, including those with other ventriculoarterial alignments, such as transposition of the great arteries. Forty-eight (37%) of 129 patients with normally aligned great arteries (and two ventricles) had anomalous attachment of septum primum. Ten (34%) of 29 patients with double outlet right ventricle and left AV valve underdevelopment had this anomaly. Four (50%) of eight patients with single ventricle exhibited this atrial septal variant. The most reliable view to identify anomalous attachment was the subcostal left oblique-equivalent cut. Recognition of atrial septal morphology has implications for preoperative and intraoperative management of patients with left AV valve underdevelopment. The similar prevalence of this atrial septal variant in patients with normally aligned great arteries, double outlet right ventricle and transposed great arteries suggests that there may be a common mechanism for left AV valve underdevelopment that is independent of the development of the arterial portion of the heart.\r"

The immediate angiographic success rate was 90% for both occlusions and stenoses, and clinical success was obtained in 82% of patients. The stenoses were reduced from 83 +/- 13% to 17 +/- 18% acutely and to 31 +/- 26% at 6 months; the occlusions were reduced from 100% to 9 +/- 9% initially and to 60 +/- 34% at 6 months. Angiographic restenosis was found in 24% of lesions: 23% in concentric and 11% in eccentric lesions and 47% in total occlusions. At 1 year, 72% of patients had clinically patent arteries with maintained Doppler index and walking distance. Three of four patients undergoing repeat atherectomy had a second restenosis. In summary, the procedure was found to be safe and effective in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. It appears to be particularly beneficial in the treatment of eccentric stenoses and is not limited by the presence of calcification.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred nine patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter, or both, who had failed one to five previous antiarrhythmic drug trials were treated with propafenone and, subsequently, sotalol if atrial fibrillation recurred. The clinical profile of the study group was as follows: age 63 +/- 13 years, left atrial anteroposterior dimension 4.4 +/- 0.9 cm and left ventricular ejection fraction 57 +/- 14%. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurred in 56 patients (51%) and chronic atrial fibrillation occurred in 53 patients (49%). After loading and dose titration phases were completed, the maintenance doses of drugs were 450 to 900 mg/day for propafenone and 160 to 960 mg/day for sotalol. Life table estimates of the duration of freedom from atrial fibrillation were constructed for each drug trial. The percent of patients free of recurrent symptomatic arrhythmia at 6 months was 39% for propafenone and 50% for sotalol. The cumulative proportion of patients successfully treated with propafenone or sotalol, or both, by 6 months was 55% and remained relatively constant beyond that point. The incidence of intolerable side effects necessitating discontinuation of therapy ranged from 7% to 8%. Thus, despite previous unsuccessful drug trials, a substantial proportion of patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory to conventional therapy can be treated successfully and safely with newer antiarrhythmic drugs. Treatment failures tend to occur early in the course of follow-up, permitting easy identification of candidates for alternative therapeutic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the use of high energy ultrasound as an alternative energy for angioplasty, an experimental ultrasonic angioplasty device was developed. The device was studied in two bioassay systems: an in vitro system for the disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi and an in vivo system for the recanalization of occluded canine femoral arteries. In vitro, sonication efficiently reduced the size of the plaques. Atheromatous plaques (n = 11) disrupted at a rate of 21 +/- 8 s/cm2; complicated plaques (n = 14) disrupted at a rate of 132 +/- 45 s/cm2 (p less than 0.001). Histologic examination revealed that the disruption of the plaques took place without concurrent damage to the media or adventitia. Ninety percent of the disrupted plaque debris had a diameter of less than 20 microns and was composed primarily of cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Solid thrombus (n = 5) weight was reduced from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 g (p less than 0.0001) after 20 s of sonication. In vivo, sonication resulted in recanalization in all seven arteries tested in seven dogs. The obstruction was reduced from 93 +/- 11% to 18 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001). On histologic examination, the arterial wall injury index was found to be 1.56 +/- 0.42 in the test arteries compared with 1.37 +/- 0.47 in the control arteries (p = NS). The disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi, together with the efficient recanalization of the occluded arteries, demonstrates the potential of ultrasound angioplasty as a catheter-based technique for angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90154533\r", 
  ".W": "A certain critical mass of myocardium is believed to be necessary to initiate ventricular fibrillation. The right ventricular isolation procedure, employed clinically to confine ventricular tachyarrhythmias to the right ventricle, decreases the ventricular mass available for fibrillation by isolating the ventricles from each other. The effect of this procedure on ventricular fibrillation thresholds is unknown. Left and right ventricular fibrillation thresholds were measured before and after right ventricular isolation in 10 adult mongrel dogs utilizing a single 5 ms stimulus of increasing current strength applied to the epicardium during the vulnerable period. There were no significant differences in heart rate, aortic blood pressure, left atrial pressure, temperature, arterial blood gases or regional myocardial blood flow between the study periods. In 9 of the 10 dogs, the isolated right ventricle could not sustain ventricular fibrillation despite the utilization of stimulus strengths of up to 80 mA. In the 10th dog, the right ventricular fibrillation threshold increased 150%, from 20 to 50 mA. The left ventricular fibrillation threshold markedly increased in every dog, with an average increase from 23 +/- 2 to 40 +/- 4 mA (p less than 0.0005). To determine whether time, cardiopulmonary bypass or the right ventricular incision could cause similar changes in ventricular fibrillation threshold, five different dogs underwent the entire experimental protocol except for incomplete isolation of the right ventricle. There were no significant changes in ventricular fibrillation thresholds in these dogs. Thus, in the canine model, right ventricular isolation can prevent the occurrence of sustained fibrillation in the isolated right ventricle and can significantly increase the left ventricular fibrillation threshold.\r"

  ".U": "90154534\r", 
  ".W": "Prolonged depression of segmental systolic thickening after brief coronary artery occlusion may result principally from events during reperfusion rather than during the ischemic interval. Thus, cellular calcium overload at reperfusion may be a mediator of contractile dysfunction after brief ischemia, and reduction of calcium entry by diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist, may enhance recovery of systolic thickening after brief periods of ischemia. Thirteen awake unsedated dogs instrumented with hemodynamic catheters, left anterior descending coronary artery occluders and five to six pairs of intramyocardial sonomicrometers underwent two 15 min coronary artery occlusions with 24 h reperfusion. The order of infusion of diltiazem (15 micrograms/kg per min) or saline solution was alternated. Systolic thickening, hemodynamic variables and regional myocardial blood flow were measured serially over 24 h. Despite equally severe ischemic dysfunction during coronary occlusion, diltiazem-treated segments with systolic thinning during ischemia recovered control segmental thickening significantly earlier than saline solution-treated segments (at 30 versus 180 min of reperfusion). Blood pressure was mildly decreased during diltiazem treatment; therefore, a second group of 10 dogs underwent a similar occlusion and reflow period during infusion of nitroprusside to lower mean arterial pressure equivalently. Decreases in blood pressure in this group resulted in some improvement in segmental systolic function; however, this did not reach statistical significance at any time. Regional myocardial blood flows were similar in the saline solution- and diltiazem-treated groups during ischemia and reflow. Thus, it is concluded that 1) diltiazem infusion significantly enhanced recovery of segmental systolic thickening after 15 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion; 2) the enhancement in segmental systolic function could not entirely be attributed to decreased mean arterial pressure; 3) improvement in postischemic segmental ventricular function was seen only in those segments with systolic thinning during ischemia; thus, segments with the most severe ischemic dysfunction benefited most; and 4) there were no important differences in regional myocardial blood flow during ischemia and reperfusion between saline- and diltiazem-treated animals.\r"

These cutoffs are then used to compare groups with asthma and with positive allergy skin tests with the reference population. Distributions of IgE levels in these groups are vastly different, but defining an upper \"limit of normal\" for serum IgE is of doubtful clinical value because there is no single level of IgE that distinguishes different groups with any precision. The spread of IgE values is extremely wide in subjects with and without known allergic diseases.\r"

The mean IgE level (132 IU/ml) of infected subjects with a helper T-lymphocyte number less than or equal to 200/mm3 was significantly greater than mean IgE levels of the uninfected heterosexual (38 IU/ml) and homosexual (35 IU/ml) groups. IgE levels were inversely related to both helper T cell and suppressor/cytotoxic T cell numbers but not to IgG or IgA levels. The increase in IgE was not a reflection of an increased prevalence of atopic disease (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis) in the infected subjects. The elevation of IgE may be related to a difference among the groups in T cell production of IgE regulatory lymphokines.\r"

This patient has a dramatic persistent deficiency in her circulating \"classic\" NK cells (CD3-, CD16+, NKH1+) and a simultaneous persistent expansion of a normally minor lymphocyte cell subset (CD3+, CD4-, CD8-, NKH1+) that does not express the alpha beta heterodimer of the T cell receptor. T-lymphocyte function, as measured by mitogen and alloantigen responsiveness in vitro, was normal. The coexistence of this particular clinical complex with this unusual set of laboratory abnormalities tends to emphasize our meager understanding of the biologic role of NK cells. At the very least, these findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of NK cell deficiency need not be dominated by disseminated systemic viral infections and that perhaps there should be a higher index of suspicion for the scrutinization of NK cell function.\r"

Histamine was present in all samples with the highest levels in the crude insect venoms. The same held for LTC4 with highest quantities in a liquid commercial bee venom extract and in the crude venoms. Relatively large amounts of LTB4 were recovered from the sea nettles with a correspondingly high NCA. Although small levels of LTB4 were found in the other samples, there was no clear correlation to the NCA on a quantitative basis. The demonstration of these mediators offers an explanation for the occurrence of local immediate and persistent wheals at sites of bee, wasp, and sea nettle stings in nonsensitized individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Of 247 patients referred to the Pediatric Immunology Clinic, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Conn., for recurrent infections, 13 patients were found to have an abnormal delay in the onset of IgG synthesis and prolongation of the physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. At first observation, their mean age was 10.6 months. All patients had abnormally low serum IgG levels (less than or equal to 2 SD for their age). The mean serum IgG level for our patient population was 270 +/- 81 mg/dl; the mean serum IgG level of the control group was 749 +/- 440 mg/dl. Clinically, these patients were first observed with recurrent otitis media, respiratory infections, bronchitis and/or asthma, and formula intolerance. Despite recurrent respiratory tract infections, specific antibodies to the respiratory viruses were absent in nine of 11 patients tested who were observed before 17 months of age. On follow-up, two of the 13 patients never developed specific antibodies to viral agents, although their serum IgG levels normalized; one patient became serology positive at the same time that the serum IgG normalized. In two patients, the serum IgG levels returned to within the normal range for age before the appearance of specific viral antibodies. In eight patients, the appearance of specific viral antibodies was detected before the serum IgG levels returned to normal. Five of these eight patients were treated for short periods (9 months) with replacement immune serum globulin (intramuscular) therapy and did clinically well. These observations suggest that replacement immune serum globulin for short periods of time does not appear to suppress the production of specific, naturally occurring antibodies and the resolution of the hypogammaglobulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the development and evaluation of a behavioral measure of dietary patterns related to selecting low-fat diets. An 18-item questionnaire, based on an anthropological theory of dietary change, was developed to assess four relevant dimensions of dietary behavior: (a) excluding high-fat ingredients and preparation techniques, (b) modifying high-fat foods, (c) substituting specially manufactured low-fat foods for their higher-fat counterparts, and (d) replacing high-fat foods with low-fat alternatives. In this study, 99 women completed the diet behavior questionnaire twice and, to characterize precisely their dietary fat intake, also completed two 4-day food records and a food frequency questionnaire. Participants were aged 45 to 59 years and were selected to have a wide range of fat intakes (19.4% to 49.4% of calories from fat). Confirmatory factor analysis identified five scales that corresponded to those hypothesized, except for exclusion, which split into avoiding meat and avoiding fat as a seasoning. The scales had high test-retest and internal consistency reliabilities, and correlations with percent of calories from fat ranged from 0.34 to 0.57 (p less than .01). The correlation of the sum of the five scales (18 items) with percent of calories from fat was 0.68 (p less than .001) and, in multiple regression models, the multiple R2 using all factors to predict percent of calories from fat was 0.47. Overall, these findings supported the validity of the theoretical model of dietary patterns related to selecting diets low in fat. We conclude that a standardized, behavioral approach to measuring fat-related dietary behavior may be useful for designing and evaluating nutrition intervention programs.\r"

  ".W": "A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and oat bran supplementation for treatment of hypercholesterolemia were studied for their effectiveness in lowering blood lipids and their impact on dietary intake. Seventy-one free-living men and women with hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol greater than 75th percentile) were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (LFLC); low-fat, low-cholesterol diet plus 50 gm/day oat bran (LFLC + OB); 50 gm/day oat bran supplemented diet (OB); or 42.5 gm/day processed oat bran (ready-to-eat cereal containing beta-glucan concentrated from oat bran) (POB). Subjects assigned to regimens OB and POB were requested to add the oat supplement without making additional changes in their diet. Serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol analyses were performed at 4-week intervals, and diet records were assigned and analyzed. All groups experienced significant decreases in cholesterol from original levels (p less than .05). The average decrease in total serum cholesterol varied from 10% to 17%, with no significant differences among the four groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased in all groups except group 4, in which there was a slight increase; however, no differences were found between groups. Energy, fat, and cholesterol intakes decreased in all groups, suggesting that displacement of higher fat foods from the diet may be one of the many mechanisms whereby oat supplements lower serum cholesterol. In addition, all groups reduced their intakes of calcium, copper, folic acid, and potassium from marginal levels at the beginning of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The energy, nutrient, and food intake patterns of smokers, those how had quit smoking, and those who had never smoked cigarettes were compared. Mean energy intakes of smokers (1,627 kcal), those who had never smoked (1,620 kcal), and those who had quit at least 1 year before the interview (1,719 kcal) were not significantly different. Self-reported body weight was significantly different between never-smokers and smokers (p less than .01) and quitters (p less than .05) only for the oldest category of women (ages 41 to 50 years). The consumption of fruits (p less than .001) and vegetables (p less than .01) was significantly lower and the intake of eggs (p less than .01), sugars (p less than .001), regular carbonated soft drinks (p less than .01), coffee (p less than .001), and alcoholic beverages (p less than .001) was significantly higher for women smokers than for non-smokers. After controlling through regression analysis for physical activity, health status, and demographic characteristics, we found that smokers, compared with never-smokers, had significantly lower protein (p less than .04), dietary fiber (p less than .001), vitamin C (p less than .001), and thiamin (p less than .01) intakes and higher cholesterol (p less than .02) intakes per 1,000 kcal.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effectiveness of a nutrient-based (diet guide) approach with that of a food-group (exchange lists) approach to menu planning for persons with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Each method was presented to four groups in three-session workshops emphasizing meal planning to reduce risk of heart disease. The diet guide method evaluated menus specifically for calories, source of calories, cholesterol, fiber, sodium, and key vitamins and minerals. Of 105 subjects recruited, 97 completed the workshops and 83 the 6-month follow-up. Subjects responded positively to the diet guide method, finding it as easy to use as the exchange lists method. Menu planning and evaluation initially took longer using the diet guide than the exchange group method (25 vs. 16 minutes per day), but subjects indicated that time was well spent. Also, with practice, the time required to use the diet guide method decreased to 17 minutes per day. Both diet-education programs improved attitude and knowledge regarding diabetes, diet, and nutrition, with retention of knowledge gained for up to 6 months. Increases in applied nutrition knowledge scores were significantly greater, however, for diet guide than for exchange lists subjects both 3 months (24% vs. 15% increase) and 6 months postworkshop (15% vs. 8% increase). We conclude that the diet guide method can effectively serve as an alternative menu-planning system to exchange lists for patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes who have at least a high school education.\r"

  ".W": "On the premise that empathy is important in patient care and nutrition counseling, the empathy levels of 217 clinical dietitians and 168 dietetic interns were measured using the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index is designed to measure four aspects of empathy: empathic concern (EC), fantasy (FS), personal distress (PD), and perspective-taking (PT). Personal and professional characteristics were surveyed to determine possible influence on empathy. The instrument was mailed to 26 randomly selected internship programs. All of the dietetic interns and clinical dietitians who spend 80% of their time in patient care were requested to participate. The mean ages of the dietitians and interns were 35 and 25 years, respectively. Interns scored significantly higher on the EC (29.06, p less than .05) and FS (24.65, p less than .0005) scales than the dietitians (EC = 28.20, FS = 22.53). There was a highly significant negative correlation (r = -0.26, p less than .0001) between fantasy and age for dietitians and interns and between fantasy and experience for the dietitians (r = -0.23, p less than .0005). Dietitians and interns who had had graduate coursework in counselling, psychology, and/or educational psychology had significantly lower mean scores on the PD (17.14, p less than .05) and EC (27.82, p less than .05) scales and a significantly higher mean score on the PT (27.06, p less than .05) scale. Responses to an opinion question indicated that the mean for ideal percentage of time spent in direct patient contact was 70.1 for dietitians and 61.4 for interns, a highly significant difference (p less than .0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Attitudinal variables had a stronger relationship with the choice of feeding method than either the social influence or psychological variables. When all the variables that were associated with choice of feeding method were analyzed with multiple regression analysis, the positive attitudes toward breast feeding scale had the strongest impact on choice of method, followed in order by method preferred by the father, the positive attitudes toward formula scale, and the knowledge about breast feeding scale. The regression model consisting of those four variables explained 64% of the variation in choice of feeding method and correctly classified the women's feeding method choice in 82% of the cases. These findings suggest that breast-feeding promotion interventions should be provided by health care professionals at critical times during the prepartum period and that fathers should be included in the discussion of the infant feeding decision.\r"

Teaching teams, consisting of an extension agent and a registered dietitian, were used in course delivery. A wide variety of printed and audiovisual teaching aids helped participants learn through discussion, goal setting, games, and food tasting. Evaluation components of the course included demographic and pre- and post-course food frequency information as well as an overall evaluation by each participant. Post-course evaluation data were collected at a reunion session held 2 months after course completion. One hundred forty-two of 195 participants (73%) completed the course and the evaluation. Three-fourths of the participants had a family history of at least one of the life-style diseases addressed by the course. The food frequency results indicated that participants made some significant changes in their food practices. They decreased the number of times they selected high-fat cheese, regular red meats, foods from the saturated fatty acid group, desserts, sodium-rich products, and tea/coffee (p less than .05), and they increased selection of low-fat dairy products (p less than .05). Further study is recommended to determine whether individuals maintain the dietary changes and how those changes affect others in the person's immediate environment.\r"

Ergogenic drugs and a diuretic were self-administered. At the contest, the subject placed in the top three for his weight division. The strict diet enabled the subject to lose fat weight predictably in preparation for the contest. However, some weight lost was lean body tissue, suggesting the rate of loss was too fast. Blood chemistry studies revealed abnormalities, including hemoconcentration and alterations in cholesterol metabolism, which could have placed the subject at risk for thromboembolic phenomena because of increased blood viscosity. Those abnormalities could reflect the use of ergogenic drugs. For this subject, bodybuilding included diet, exercise, and drug regimens, which are common among competitive athletes.\r"

The study also evaluated three different needs assessment procedures. First, data were obtained from 22 clinical dietitians invited to participate in focus group interviews. The dietitians suggested continuing education topics representing four aspects of practice: clinical, procedural, professional development, and management skills. With the data obtained, two needs assessment instruments subsequently were prepared and distributed at a statewide conference. Fourteen percent of 650 attending dietitians volunteered to participate in the needs assessment process. Forty-four completed a survey using an electronic preference recording device, and 50 completed printed questionnaires. Although not directly comparable, responses to both questionnaire formats generally confirmed suggestions obtained from focus groups. Topics such as computer applications, patient education, staff development, and time management led the wide variety of choices selected. Respondents favored live, affordable, conveniently located programs delivered effectively by experts using a participatory format. Of the three assessment procedures used, focus group interviews provided the most detailed information for planning continuing education. Surveys based on focus group results are useful for contributing quantitative data. We conclude that a comprehensive plan for dietitians' professional development through continuing professional education should include structured needs assessments. The assessments are necessary to determine the diverse and changing concerns, needs, and preferences of dietitians and the organizations employing them.\r"

We examined changing direct and indirect effects of peptic ulcer and gastritis/duodenitis on the British population from 1970 to 1985. Death rates from gastric ulcer declined irregularly for all except women 65 years of age and older, in whom it increased, while for duodenal ulcer mortality declined only for men less than 65 years old and increased sharply for women 65 years and above. Mortality due to gastritis/duodenitis rose irregularly to 1980 and then fell inconsistently through 1985, and was but 1.0 to 1.5% that of peptic ulcer. Elderly women were disproportionately affected, much as with peptic ulcer. There was no significant change in essentially stable time trends for peptic ulcer perforation deaths. Hospitalizations for gastric and duodenal ulcer continued to fall through 1985 except for those age 65 years and above. Hospitalizations for peptic ulcer hemorrhage did not change overall, but the distribution favoring the elderly in the early 1970s reversed. Elderly men and women are now the most likely to bleed for both gastric and duodenal ulcer. Hospitalizations for gastritis/duodenitis increased for all populations. Peptic ulcer operations declined markedly for all groups, most for men and women less than 65 years old. Peptic ulcer as a cause of work loss declined sharply over time for men but was stable for women, while work loss due to gastritis/duodenitis plunged for both sexes beginning in 1979. Mean days off work per spell of absenteeism remained relatively constant: 35-45 days for peptic ulcer and 10-12 days for gastritis/duodenitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report the morphology and distribution of cavernous vessels in an autopsy liver of hepatocellular carcinoma, using a whole liver slice. In this case, antemortem angiography disclosed obstruction of portal veins at the hepatic hilus and portal trunk as well as many hepatopetal collaterals, mainly at the hepatic hilus. Tumor thrombi were diffusely distributed in the liver from the portal trunk to peripheral portal branches at autopsy. The cavernous vessels, which were positive for Factor VIII-related antigen, were also distributed throughout the liver from the hepatic hilus to the subcapsular regions, especially around the occluded portal veins by hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that these vessels were collaterals that developed as the result of portal obstruction. This study suggests that these vessels might be present from the hepatic hilus to the subcapsular regions, even if antemortem imaging techniques disclose collateral vessels only at the hepatic hilus.\r"

Epithelial tumors with melanosomes are very unusual. We report the case of a 76-year-old woman with rectal adenocarcinoma that invaded the intestine and vagina extensively. At the anorectal site, melanin pigment was found in the cytoplasm of the malignant neoplastic epithelial cells, and melanosomes were ultrastructurally confirmed at various developmental stages. Melanocytes with cytoplasmic processes spreading between neoplastic cells were also present as the apparent source of the pigment contained in the neoplastic cells.\r"

In order to determine the pattern of H2-antagonist usage for this indication, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 137 patients admitted with acute UGI bleeding over a 1-year period at two teaching hospitals in West Texas. An H2-antagonist was ordered in 89% of patients (77%) intravenous, 12% oral). It was administered within 2 h of admission in 25% of these patients, within 4 h in 54%, and within 8 h in 78%. An H2-antagonist was ordered among the initial six orders in 49% and among the initial 10 orders in 77% of patients. Considering orders for specific therapies, an H2-antagonist was in the initial three orders in 60% of patients and among the initial six orders in 97%. Of the patients who were prescribed an H2-antagonist and who also had upper endoscopy, the drug was ordered prior to endoscopy in 86%. This review of H2-antagonist usage in the management of acute UGI bleeding has identified a prescribing pattern of writing for these drugs early in the sequence of order writing, with the drugs being given early in the course of hospitalization.\r"

Moreover, intestinal motor response to a 600-kcal test meal was significantly impaired in the patient group (61.1 +/- 8.1 versus 113.2 +/- 4.2 min, p less than 0.05). We conclude that manometric techniques may be important for investigating patients with chronic dyspepsia and negative findings at previous conventional examinations.\r"

The duodenal folds receive an end-arteriole supply and are thus affected before other areas of the duodenum. Given the degree of necrosis associated with these lesions on pathological examination, we have chosen the term necrotizing duodenitis to describe the lesions observed.\r"

Although the precise mechanism is unknown, the most commonly postulated theories regarding its pathogenesis are bile stasis, sepsis, and ischemia. The role of ischemia in this process, whose etiology is multifactorial, has been difficult to elucidate. Consequently, we report two patients who developed acute acalculous cholecystitis without apparent risk for the disease other than severe visceral atherosclerosis. Both patients had symptomatic mesenteric vascular disease requiring revascularization and developed fulminant acalculous cholecystitis temporally related to exacerbation of their visceral ischemia. These cases suggest that patients with visceral atherosclerosis may be at increased risk for acute acalculous cholecystitis, perhaps due to impaired mucosal resistance when other factors, such as bile statis and sepsis, are also present.\r"

When the two techniques were considered separately, a final diagnosis of cirrhosis was possible in 78.4% by laparoscopy and in 78.8% by biopsy of the total of 411 cases, whereas, doing both procedures improved the diagnostic yield to 97.7% by decreasing the percentage of false negatives for each technique. Laparoscopy can also provide important additional information by detecting intrabdominal signs of portal hypertension and so improve the macroscopic diagnosis of cirrhosis.

They underwent 332 sessions of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy, 134 of which were performed for acute variceal bleeding. Most patients (90.5%) had nonalcoholic portal hypertension. Emergency sclerotherapy (1-6 h after presentation) was performed in 65 bleeding episodes in 43 patients, and delayed sclerotherapy (more than 24 h from presentation) was performed in 69 episodes in 41 patients. The selection of patients was randomized. Emergency sclerotherapy arrested active variceal bleeding in all patients and resulted in an earlier eradication of varices and for a longer period than delayed sclerotherapy. Larger volumes of sclerosant (a mean of 26 ml compared to 13 ml) were more effective in arrest of bleeding and in an early eradication of varices. We conclude that emergency sclerotherapy, mainly with a large sclerosant volume, is highly effective in arresting active variceal bleeding. Such earlier arrest of bleeding was associated with reduced morbidity and mortality.\r"

A heterogeneous hepatic venous pressure gradient, defined as a difference of greater than 4 mmHg between the highest and lowest values of the pressure gradient in any patient, was found in 46% of the hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 43% of the metastatic cancers. Comparing the diagnostic efficacy of this phenomenon with an elevated alpha-fetoprotein, based on 500 randomly selected catheterizations, showed that the heterogeneous gradient was 46% sensitive and 99% specific for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while the alpha-fetoprotein was 67% sensitive and 99% specific. Positive and negative predictive values were 86 and 95%, respectively, for the heterogeneous gradient, and 83 and 97% for the alpha-fetoprotein. Its expense and relative invasiveness make hepatic vein catheterization an unacceptable routine in patients suspected of having hepatic malignancy. However, we suggest that the unexpected finding of a heterogeneous pressure gradient should trigger a search for hepatic cancer.\r"

At endoscopy, prolapse of the gastric mucosa into the esophageal lumen was quite evident whenever the patients retched. The endoscopic features and pathogenesis of Mallory-Weiss syndrome were readily differentiated. It seemed probable that repeated retching causing intussusception of the cardia of the stomach can mechanically produce gastritis and should be a recognizable cause of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

There was a discrepancy between her unremarkable physical examination and extremely elevated amylase (3,210 U/L) which suggested nonpancreatic hyperamylasemia; normal serum pancreatic isoamylase, trypsinogen, and lipase confirmed this suspicion. The patient was noted to have self-induced vomiting in the hospital which she admitted was frequent behavior. her psychiatric disturbance was characterized as an atypical eating disorder. This case illustrates that hyperamylasemia in association with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may not be secondary to pancreatitis and that use of a second serum marker (such as trypsinogen, lipase, or isoamylase) helps to establish a definitive diagnosis.\r"

We refer to these cells that are detectable in the modified LDA as \"Ag-conditioned\" T cells (cHTL and cCTL). We have used the modified LDA techniques in conjunction with conventional LDA techniques (which enumerate all Ag-specific T cells) to evaluate the in vivo distribution of Ag-conditioned cHTL and cCTL following in vivo sensitization to alloantigens via sponge matrix or skin allografts. In general, we observed the following regarding the distribution of cHTL and cCTL: 1) Ag-conditioned HTL and CTL were detectable only after in vivo sensitization with alloantigen: 2) not all Ag-reactive T cells became conditioned T cells after in vivo Ag deposition; 3) the percentage of Ag-reactive T cells that converted to conditioned T cells after Ag deposition varied among different lymphoid compartments; 4) a high percentage of cHTL, but a low percentage of cCTL, accumulated in regional lymph nodes and spleen; 5) cHTL accumulated in peripheral blood, whereas cCTL did not; 6) Ag-conditioned cHTL were detectable in various lymphoid tissues for greater than 60 days following Ag deposition, whereas cCTL were detectable for only 14 to 20 days; and 7) unlike the other lymphoid sites, the site of Ag deposition accumulated a high percentage of both Ag-stimulated cHTL and cCTL. Furthermore, cHTL and cCTL appeared to reside in phenotypically distinct T cell subsets in that in vivo treatment with anti-L3T4 mAb abrogated the accumulation of HTL, but not CTL, at the site of Ag deposition. These data demonstrate differential compartmentalization of Ag-conditioned cHTL and cCTL subsequent to in vivo Ag deposition. The implications of these findings regarding the monitoring of in vivo immune responses are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of experimental animals to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) results in severe thymic atrophy and suppression of cell-mediated and humoral immune functions. However, despite much effort the mechanism by which TCDD produces these responses, particularly thymic atrophy, remains unclear. In this report, we have examined the effect of acute TCDD exposure on lymphocyte stem cells in young adult BALB/c mice to determine whether alterations to events early in T lymphopoiesis contribute to TCDD-induced thymic atrophy. TCDD produced a dose-dependent reduction in thymic weight and cellularity following a single dose of 5 to 120 micrograms TCDD/kg. This thymic atrophy correlated with a dose-dependent suppression of the biosynthesis and mRNA levels of the lymphocyte stem cell-specific DNA polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in bone marrow and thymus. However, the reduction in thymic terminal deoxynucleotidyl nucleotidyl transferase synthesis, on a per cell basis, was less than that observed in bone marrow. Intrathymic CD4/CD8 and IL-2R expression demonstrated only mild alterations after exposure to 30 micrograms TCDD/kg. These data suggest that thymocytes are more refractory to TCDD than are pre-T cells. To assess this possibility directly, bone marrow prothymocytes from TCDD-treated donor mice were examined for their capacity to reconstitute the thymuses of adoptive, irradiated recipients. Our results indicate that prothymocyte activity was severely impaired by TCDD exposure and that this effect occurred at low tissue levels of TCDD. In contrast, we observed no reduction in the number of colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage and a moderate decrease in colony-forming unit-spleen. These data suggest that TCDD-induced thymic atrophy is the result, at least in part, of impaired thymic seeding by prothymocytes.\r"

The ability of Lewis rat splenic T cells to transfer EAE after in vitro incubation with MBP-pulsed dendritic cells (DC) was used as an index of MBP-specific T cell activation. OVA, previously processed by macrophages, was incubated with MBP and DC at the pulsing stage to determine whether it could inhibit presentation of the autoantigen. At molar equivalents of 2.5:1 and 20:1 relative to MBP, processed OVA increasingly inhibited the ability of DC to activate MBP-specific T cells for EAE transfer. Unprocessed OVA, which cannot be presented immunogenically by Lewis rat DC, was much less effective. However, processed OVA added to DC after they had been pulsed with MBP could not compete. OVA also blocked appearance of EAE when mixed with MBP/CFA in the inoculum used for active induction of the disease. Splenic T cells from MBP + OVA/CFA-immunized rats transferred EAE with a substantially delayed onset, suggesting that a reduced number of MBP-specific T cells was generated by immunizing with the OVA + MBP mixture compared with MBP alone. Overall, the data indicate that fragments of a foreign protein, OVA, which can be bound by APC, can also inhibit presentation of encephalitogenic determinants of MBP to T cells.\r"

  ".W": "A hybrid murine class I gene, Q10/L, was injected into C3H/HeJ fertilized ova to produce transgenic (TG) mice. This fusion gene contained 414 bp of Q10 promoter sequences which was sufficient to direct liver-specific expression in two lines of animals. Animals from these lines did not have Q10/L mRNA in 10 nonhepatic tissues examined including thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. The ontogeny of Q10/Ld expression in both liver and yolk sac paralleled expression of endogenous Q10. Analysis of liver cells from these lines by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of the Q10/L Ag solely on hepatocytes. TG animals showed no signs of hepatic disease as evidenced by an absence of cellular infiltrates in the liver and a normal profile of serum enzymes that are elevated in association with hepatic disease. When spleen cells from TG animals were cocultured with splenocytes that express Ag cross-reactive with Q10/L, CTL were generated that recognized and lysed L cells which express Q10/L. However, the extent of lysis was less than that generated from non-TG control littermates. That these cross-reactive T cells were physiologically significant was demonstrated by adoptive transfer of in vivo primed T cell enriched spleen cells which produced a mononuclear infiltration of the liver of TG recipients. However, inoculation of Q10/L L cells or splenocytes expressing Q10/L cross-reactive Ag into TG mice did not induce cellular infiltration or overt hepatic disease. Whereas inoculation of normal C3H mice with these cells led to priming of Q10/L reactive CTL, anti-Q10/L CTL could not be primed in TG mice. This suggests that Ag expression solely on hepatocytes can lead to inactivation of specific CTL clones and thus account for the observed in vivo tolerance.\r"

Using a panel of murine T cell clones, we demonstrate that the IL-2-induced proliferation of Th1 clones is dramatically inhibited by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody, whereas that of Th2 clones is not. This unresponsiveness of Th1 clones to IL-2 is not due to decreases in IL-2R expression. Supernatants from Th1 or Th2 cell cultures fail to alter the effects of anti-CD3 on the two types of clones, suggesting that unresponsiveness induced in Th1 clones or the lack thereof in Th2 clones is not mediated by a stable cytokine(s). Accessory cells enhance the proliferation of Th1 cells exposed to low concentrations of anti-CD3, but the unresponsiveness induced by high concentrations of anti-CD3 is not prevented by accessory cells. Finally, soluble anti-CD4 antibody prevents the induction of the unresponsive state even at high concentrations of anti-CD3. These experiments demonstrate that two subsets of cloned CD4+ T cells differ in their responses to anti-CD3, and that CD4 molecules may play a critical role in regulating the outcome of receptor-mediated stimulation.\r"

Here we have expressed mutations at amino acid 91 and 92 of CD2 in the T cell hybridoma. The mutated CD2 molecules were functional in that pairs of anti-CD2 mAb that continued to bind were able to stimulate IL-2 production by the hybridomas. However, CD2 mutants with either the 91 or 92 amino acid substitution had lost the ability to bind to or be activated by either SRBC, which bear an LFA-3 homologue, or by murine L cells expressing human LFA-3. Unlike hybridomas expressing the wild-type CD2 molecule, there was no enhanced response to Ag stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that the mutated CD2 molecules were no longer able to bind to, or to utilize, LFA-3 for activation. We have previously demonstrated that a mutation at amino acid 51 of CD2 results in loss of binding to LFA-3. Whether these two regions of CD2, discrete and separable by amino acid sequence, form one or more binding sites for LFA-3 remains to be determined.\r"

When B cells were cultured in the presence of C1q that had been frozen, T cells, and suboptimal concentrations of PWM, there was a dose-dependent enhancement of IgM, IgG, and IgA by the B cells. No significant enhancement of Ig production by B cells was seen in the absence of T cells or PWM. The contribution of T cells or PWM could be replaced by supernatants of PMA and Con A-activated PBMC (T cell growth factor). C1q that had been frozen, in contrast with freshly isolated C1q, was at least 3 times more active in enhancement of the production of Ig by B cells in culture in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of T cell growth factor. The capability of C1q to stimulate B cells could be ascribed to aggregates of C1q. Monomeric C1q was only marginally active to stimulate B cell Ig production, whereas dimeric and tetrameric C1q were able to enhance Ig production by B cells in relation to their size. Furthermore, aggregation of C1q on soluble aggregates of rabbit IgM also increased its potential to enhance B cell Ig production. The interaction of C1q with the B cells occurs via the collagenous tail of C1q, as suggested by inhibition experiments with purified collagenous tails and globular heads of C1q. These results indicate that triggering of C1qR on B cells positively regulates Ig production in vitro.\r"

Northern blots of RNA from mitogen-activated lamina propria T cells contained more mRNA for IL-2 and IFN-gamma than did mesenteric lymph node T cells. In comparison with lymphocytes from peripheral sites, there was high expression of IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA in both mesenteric lymph node and lamina propria T cells. In studies of lymphokine utilization, T cells from lamina propria had high IL-2-induced but no IL-4-induced proliferative responses. In contrast, mesenteric lymph node T cells had high IL-4-induced and lower IL-2-induced proliferative responses compared with lamina propria T cells. Lamina propria T cells had higher helper activity in PWM-stimulated cultures and exhibited less inhibition by IL-4 than did mesenteric lymph node T cells. These data and previous studies suggest that T cells in an inductive site such as the mesenteric lymph node are a mixed population containing both \"naive\" cells with low potential for IFN-gamma and IL-2 production and differentiated cells with high potential for IL-4 and IL-5 production. In contrast, the data suggest that T cells in the effector compartment of the lamina propria are comprised primarily of differentiated \"memory\" cells that produce high levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5, have high helper activity, and have a more limited ability to proliferate in response to lymphokines such as IL-4.\r"

The immunoconjugates were purified by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration and Mono S ion exchange chromatography. Immunoconjugate G3.519-PAP-S specifically killed human T cells, H9, infected with three diverse HIV-1 strains, HTLV-IIIB, -IIIMN, and -IIIRF. Inhibition of thymidine incorporation by the immunoconjugate was concentration-dependent, with the ID50 ranging from 1.4 x 10(-10) M to 1.7 x 10(-9) M. Immunoconjugate BAT123-PAP-S was effective in killing H9 cells infected with HTLV-IIIB (ID50 = 4.3 x 10(-11) M) and -IIIMN (ID50 = 4.7 x 10(-10) M), but not -IIIRF. Both immunoconjugates did not inhibit thymidine incorporation in uninfected H9 cells up to a concentration of 5.3 x 10(-8) M, and their cytotoxic activities could be competitively blocked by the respective unconjugated antibodies. The immunoconjugates retained the ability to neutralize HIV virions to infect T cells and to prevent the syncytium formation. These in vitro studies suggest that the use of immunoconjugates capable of killing HIV-infected T cells and neutralizing virus may provide an alternative treatment for HIV-infected persons.\r"

Ig of this specificity was not demonstrable in serum from normal individuals, but, in a limited survey, was detected in serum from patients with acute hepatitis A or infectious mononucleosis. 110K shares a number of properties with nucleolin, i.e., identical Mr and isoelectric point, localization in both the nucleus and the cytosol, increased expression in rapidly dividing cells, and shown to be distinct from already defined autoantigens of similar size, i.e., topoisomerase I, PM-Scl, and RNA polymerase I. Because 110K could bind denatured DNA, as demonstrated by its specific absorption by DNA-cellulose and by its reactivity with monoclonal anti-ssDNA antibody in the presence of denatured DNA, special efforts were made to distinguish reactivity of pre-formed DNA/anti-DNA complexes in SLE serum from that due to specific anti-110K autoantibodies. Although binding to 110K could be mediated by DNA and anti-DNA in some SLE sera, the accumulated evidence supports the existence of a major new autoantibody system in SLE, other autoimmune diseases, and certain virus infections.\r"

This patient was unable to generate specific cytolytic activity against donor-derived PHA-blasts in the MLC in which donor spleen cells or B lymphoblastoid cell line were used as stimulator cells. In addition, the CTL precursor frequencies against donor alloantigens were very low (1/67,000). The patient had otherwise normal immune responses in vivo and in vitro and no signs of transplant rejection. Transplant specific CTL clones were generated in high frequencies (1/195) from T cell bulk cultures activated by PHA in the absence of any sensitization by donor Ag in vitro. The repertoire of 14 donor-reactive CTL clones (12 TCR-alpha beta+ and 2 TCR-gamma delta+) was analyzed. Two TCR-alpha beta+ CD8+ clones were specific for B27. Ten TCR-alpha beta+ CTL clones directed against class II HLA Ag were isolated. Seven of these were CD4+ and recognized DRw13 (3), DQw6 (3), and DPw1 (1), whereas three of these clones were CD4-CD8+ recognizing DRw13 (1) and DQw6 (2). In addition, two donor-specific TCR-gamma delta+ CTL clones were obtained recognizing HLA-A9(23,24) and DQw6. Our data indicate that the precursors of CTL clones specifically directed against donor class I or II HLA Ag are not deleted from the repertoire and that part of this reactivity resides in the TCR-gamma delta+ fraction.\r"

As no receptors for IL-1 were detected in untreated nuclei, these results suggest IL-1 driven translocation of the cell surface IL-1R complex to the nucleus. IL-1R internalization was correlated with IL-1 signal transduction events required to induce growth factor production from several subclones of EL-4 cells.

In the present study we examined the role of both constitutively expressed monocyte Fc gamma R, the 72-kDa high affinity Fc gamma R (Fc gamma RI), and the 40-kDa low affinity receptor (Fc gamma RII), in the induction of TNF secretion. On the basis of preferential binding of the Fc moiety of murine mAb of different isotype, Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII were selectively cross-linked by using either solid-phase murine (m)IgG2a, or solid-phase mIgG1, respectively. On freshly isolated, untreated monocytes only cross-linking of Fc gamma RI with solid-phase mIgG2a induced TNF secretion. The interaction between Fc gamma RII and mIgG1 could be enhanced by treatment of monocytes with proteases or with the desialylating enzyme neuraminidase. After treatment of monocytes with these enzymes, TNF secretion was effectively induced by solid-phase mIgG1, apparently through cross-linking of Fc gamma RII. However, mIgG1-induced TNF secretion differed between protease-treated monocytes from high responder individuals and monocytes from low responder individuals, TNF secretion being considerably less in the latter population. Protease-treated monocytes and mononuclear cells from individuals with an inherited defect in cell membrane expression of Fc gamma RI were induced to secrete TNF by solid-phase human IgG, confirming the capacity of Fc gamma RII to induce TNF secretion. It was not possible to induce TNF secretion by cross-linking Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII with anti-Fc gamma R mAb and soluble or solid-phase anti-mIgG, indicating that high affinity Fc-Fc gamma R interactions are necessary to induce release of this cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to the regulation of B lymphocyte growth and differentiation, the cytokine IL-4 (BSF-1) exerts effects on T lymphocytes and other bone marrow-derived lineages. We show here that recombinant mouse IL-4 synergizes with low levels of IL-2 to increase the yield of cytotoxic activity in a primary MLR, and the proliferation of both cloned IL-2-dependent CTL lines and cells obtained from a primary MLR. IL-4 did not induce the proliferation of any of several cloned CTL cell lines on its own. It also did not replace IL-2 in stimulating the growth or reactivation of quiescent, antigen-dependent CTL clones. However, IL-4 was synergistic with IL-2 after reactivation of the quiescent cells with antigen plus IL-2. Enhancement by IL-4 of the IL-2-driven proliferation of an antigen-independent line was blocked by the addition of anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody. Although incubation of the CTL clones with IL-4 or with IL-2 plus IL-4 induced a transient increase in the expression of the mRNA encoding the 55 kDa IL-2 receptor, no change in the number or affinity of IL-2 receptors because of IL-4 was detected. This suggests that IL-4 does not potentiate the IL-2 response by altering IL-2 receptor levels. Instead, we propose that the synergistic effect of IL-4 is mediated by a different signalling mechanism from that used by IL-2.\r"

  ".U": "90154808\r", 
  ".W": "IL-5 is a T cell-derived lymphokine that induces B cell growth and differentiation in murine systems. In this study, we examined the role of carbohydrate moiety of IL-5 in the expression of biological function. IL-5 polypeptides translated in Xenopus oocytes were heterogeneous in terms of isoelectric point (pI 4.7 to 8.0) and m.w. (45,000 to 60,000 under nonreducing conditions) and yielded m.w. of 25,000 to 30,000 under reducing conditions. Treatment of rIL-5 with N-glycanase under reducing conditions yielded an IL-5 monomer of m.w. 12,000 to 14,000. Furthermore, deglycosylated rIL-5 that had been translated in the presence of tunicamycin showed very limited heterogeneity by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (first dimension, nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis; second dimension, SDS-PAGE). The m.w. was 27,000 to 28,000 under non-reducing conditions and migrated to m.w. 13,000 to 14,000 under reducing conditions. These results indicate that IL-5 is a glycoprotein carrying the N-glycosidically-linked carbohydrates. Treatment of IL-5 with sialidase caused the decrease in the heterogeneity in isoelectric point of IL-5. Deglycosylated rIL-5 that had been obtained from tunicamycin-treated oocytes could bind to IL-5-responding cells (T88-M), which express both high- and low-affinity IL-5 receptors, as efficient as intact rIL-5 under high-affinity conditions. Scatchard plot analysis of equilibrium binding of 35S-labeled rIL-5 to T88-M cells revealed that the dissociation constants (Kd) of glycosylated rIL-5 and deglycosylated rIL-5 were 127 pM and 110 pM, respectively. IL-5 activities determined by both B cell growth and differentiation assays were not affected by deglycosylation. These results indicate that N-linked glycoside moiety of IL-5 molecules may not play an essential role in the expression of its activity.\r"

  ".W": "The conformational stability of B cell epitopes on the 25-kDa group I and 14-kDa group II mite allergens was compared by using heat-treated or chemically denatured allergens to inhibit the binding of native 125I allergens to murine mAb or to human IgE antibodies. Structural changes after treatment were assessed by SDS-PAGE and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Heating for 1 h at greater than 75 degrees C, treatment at pH 2.0 or pH 12.0, or with 6M guanidine or 6M urea, reduced the binding of the group I allergens to mAb or IgE antibodies by 10- to 1000-fold. The group II allergens were heat stable and even after prolonged heat treatment (5 h at 75 degrees C or 30 min at 100 degrees C) their antibody binding activity was reduced by less than twofold. The group II allergens were also resistant to pH and to denaturation with 6M guanidine. However, after reduction and alkylation, antibody binding sites on both the group I and group II allergens were destroyed. Reduction of disulfide bonds with 2-ME caused a marked shift in the molecular mass of group I allergens on SDS-PAGE, from 25 kDa to 28-31 kDa. Reduction and alkylation also generated two high m.w. forms of Der p I and Der f I. After heating (100 degrees for 30 min), both Der f I and Der f II retained significant secondary structure, as judged by circular dichroism spectroscopy, but on reduction they showed the typical spectra of fully denatured proteins (greater than 85% random structure). The results show clear differences between the susceptibility of B cell epitopes on the group I and group II allergens to denaturation. Despite these differences in stability, both allergens are equally potent immunogens for IgE antibody responses in man. The results support the view that the physical properties of allergens (low m.w. and solubility), limiting low dose exposure (1 to 10 ng/day), and host genetic and immunoregulatory processes, are more important than gross structural features in the induction and maintenance of IgE antibody responses.\r"

We show that to immobilize Ia the peptide must be amphipathic. Polar peptides appear to bind to Ia molecules as judged by competitive inhibition, but do not immobilize the MHC molecule. This suggests the possibility that peptides establish the immobilizing membrane contact via a lipophilic group. Examining the B cell membrane lipid environment, we found that treatment of B cells with phospholipase C prevents peptide-mediated immobilization of Ia. The requirement of a lipophilic peptide portion as well as of phospholipase-sensitive membrane components for effective peptide-mediated Ia aggregation on B cell membranes suggests a role for membrane phospholipids in this process. We advance the speculation that immunodominant amphipathic peptides immobilize Ia molecules by attaching them to cell surface phospholipids which we tentatively refer to as immobilizing phospholipids.\r"

This antibody was produced in tissue culture at concentrations up to 180 mg/liter of spent culture fluid. ch14.18 was characterized and compared to 14.G2a, a murine mAb against GD2 of IgG2a isotype derived from the same parental hybridoma as ch14.18.

  ".U": "90154814\r", 
  ".W": "It has previously been reported that up to 40% of the molecules of human IgG from pooled plasma (100,000 donations) spontaneously dimerize, whereas IgG prepared from a single donor contains only trace quantities of dimer. We have conducted immunoelectron microscopic analyses on such samples and have verified that the majority of dimers are composed of complexes in which two arms of each molecule are bound in a reciprocal fashion at or near the distal tips of their respective arms as previously seen in bona fide Id-anti-Id complexes. A significant role for Fc was ruled out by showing the formation of dimeric ring structures in purified F(ab')2 samples. Spontaneous dimerization was also observed in pooled bovine or mouse IgG, but not in that from single animals. Radiolabeled monomeric, single donor human IgG was used as a probe to investigate dimer formation; this material readily codimerized with IgG from other donors or from pooled plasma (either human or bovine), but did not dimerize with IgG from the same donor. Subclass analysis of multiple donor human IgG revealed that the most flexible subclass (IgG3) was overrepresented in the dimer fraction, whereas one of the less flexible subclasses (IgG2) was underrepresented. Although IgG2 could dimerize to some extent with IgG of other subclasses, it could not self-dimerize. These data suggest that structural constraints (hinge flexibility) may play a role in limiting dimerization. This suspicion was confirmed by showing that an additional 15.5% of the monomeric IgG fraction from a multidonor sample could dimerize after a chemically induced increase in hinge flexibility. Our results are interpreted to show that, although the number of functionally distinct Id produced by a species is immense, it is nontheless finite. Moreover, the Id repertoire of an individual is much smaller than that of the species. Pooling the IgG from a number of individuals increases the Id diversity, which increases the chance that any given Id-bearing molecular will encounter a complementary partner.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the cytolytic mechanisms of activated macrophages by using proteose peptone- or thioglycollate broth-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages or mouse macrophage hybridomas as effector cells, L.P3 cells, a clone of L929 cells, and P815 cells as target cells, and IFN-gamma and LPS as activators. It was determined that TNF is the main cytolytic molecule against L.P3 cells from the following results: 1) activated macrophages can produce TNF; 2) TNF shows cytotoxic activity against L.P3 cells; 3) the addition of anti-TNF antibody inhibited most of the cytolytic activity of activated macrophages against L.P3 cells. On the other hand, it was concluded that the main cytolytic mechanism against P815 cells is the production of NO2-/NO3- from L-arginine, from the following results: 1) activated macrophages can produce NO2-; 2) NaNO2 shows high cytotoxic activity against P815 cells; 3) the depletion of L-arginine from the medium inhibited most of the cytolytic activity of activated macrophages against P815 cells and NO2- production by activated macrophages. In this study, however, cytostatic effects of L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism were not studied. Thus, these results show that activated macrophages can express at least two cytolytic mechanisms independently, namely, the one that appears to be mediated by the L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism and the second that appears to be mediated directly by TNF. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that TNF and L-arginine-dependent NO2- production act synergistically as killing mechanisms of activated macrophages. These mechanisms can explain the cytolytic activity of activated macrophages against a variety of target cells.\r"

As targets we are using a panel of SV40-transformed, C3H.OL fibroblast cell lines (SV-COL) that display widely different levels of sensitivity to lysis, from highly sensitive to completely resistant. Our results show that adding conditioned medium from the macrophage-sensitive target SV-COL-E8 (CM(E8] to a cytolysis assay with the macrophage-resistant target SV-COL-F5f causes the macrophages to kill the resistant targets in a contact dependent fashion. We have termed this activity \"macrophage cell lysis factor\" (MCLF). MCLF activity was not detected in conditioned media from cells not killed by activated macrophages (i.e., 3T3-like cell lines or embryo fibroblasts) but was present in conditioned media from six other SV-COL cell lines at levels that were directly proportional to the sensitivity of those targets (r = 0.98). These data suggest that MCLF plays a key role in determining the lytic sensitivity of SV40-transformed fibroblasts. Finally, to ask whether the production of MCLF is sufficient to explain the selective recognition of SV40-transformed fibroblasts by activated macrophages we have tested whether CM(E8) will cause macrophages to kill normal cells. Our results show that in the presence of CM(E8) macrophages will kill immortalized, 3T3-like fibroblasts but will not kill normal embryo fibroblasts. These results suggest that the production of MCLF, or a similar activity, is necessary but not sufficient for macrophage cytolysis to occur and that a change in target cell phenotype that occurs during the process of immortalization is also required.\r"

  ".U": "90154824\r", 
  ".W": "CD43 is a constitutively phosphorylated 115-kDa sialoglycoprotein expressed on a variety of blood cells including lymphocytes and monocytes. L10, a mAb directed against CD43, triggers T cell activation and enhances hydrogen peroxide production in monocytes. Activation of mononuclear cells by L10 initiates phosphoinositides hydrolysis, C2+ mobilization, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In turn, activated PKC hyperphosphorylates CD43, suggesting a potential role for PKC in the regulation of signaling via CD43. To address this issue, we have analyzed the effect of PKC activation by the tumor promoter PMA on L10-triggered rise in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). Treatment of mononuclear cells with PMA profoundly inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by L10. The inhibition of CD43-mediated signaling by PMA was due, in part, to uncoupling of CD43 from the signal-transducing G protein. This was evidenced by the comparatively modest inhibition by PMA of the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the direct G protein activator AlF4-. PMA treatment did not affect the surface expression of CD43. However, it induced the hyperphosphorylation of CD43, the extent of which correlated with the inhibition of CD43-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. Staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, abrogated the hyperphosphorylation of CD43 and normalized CD43-mediated signaling in PMA-treated cells. Significantly, in the absence of PMA, staurosporine enhanced the rise in [Ca2+]i triggered by L10, suggesting that engagement of CD43 by activating ligands results in feedback inhibition by PKC. It is concluded that activation of PKC inhibits signaling via CD43 by mechanisms involving phosphorylation and uncoupling of CD43 from the signal-transducing apparatus and by distal, post-receptor events.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we reported that some kinds of lipids (cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and some negatively charged phospholipids) that are constituents of lipoproteins or cell membranes induce growth of peripheral macrophages in vitro. In this paper, we examined the effect of peroxidation of lipids on their macrophage growth-stimulating activity because lipid peroxidation is observed in many pathological states such as inflammation. When phosphatidylserine, one of the phospholipids with growth-stimulating activity, was peroxidized by UV irradiation, its macrophage growth-stimulating activity was augmented in proportion to the extent of its peroxidation. The activity of phosphatidylethanolamine was also increased by UV irradiation. On the other hand, phosphatidylcholine or highly unsaturated free fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, did not induce macrophage growth irrespective of whether they were peroxidized. The augmented activity of UV-irradiated phosphatidylserine was not affected by the coexistence of an antioxidant, vitamin E or BHT. These results suggest that some phospholipids included in damaged cells or denatured lipoproteins which are scavenged by macrophages in vivo may induce growth of peripheral macrophages more effectively when they are peroxidized by local pathological processes.\r"

HIV-infected H9 cells bound increased levels of C3 using normal human serum as a C source only after cells were first incubated with serum containing anti-HIV antibody. Uninfected H9 cells or infected cells incubated with HIV-antibody negative sera did not bind C3. Although C3 bound quickly and was maximal within 10 min, modulation of bound C3 was slow with about 50% loss after 4 h. C3 binding required specific anti-HIV antibody, was blocked by EGTA, and did not occur in C2-deficient serum suggesting that binding was via the classical pathway. The HTLV-1-infected MT-4 cell line also bound high levels of C3 after coinfection with HIV. C3 binding in HIV-infected MT4 cells was also mediated via the classical pathway because it was not observed in Mg-EGTA chelated or C2-deficient sera. However, this classical pathway activation appeared to be antibody independent because it was also detected in HIV-antibody negative serum and a-gamma-globulinemic serum. This indicates that coinfection with HTLV-1 and HIV-1 can produce novel C activating conditions. No cytotoxic effect of human C for antibody-treated HIV-infected cells was observed in a chromium release assay. However, rabbit C was cytotoxic for HIV-infected cells in the absence of anti-HIV antibodies. Our results suggest that C can be activated in vivo by infected cells via specific anti-HIV antibody. The resultant C3 deposition on infected cells could have profound effects on interaction with CR-bearing cells.\r"

  ".W": "The leukemic cells from 95% of patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) coexpress B cell differentiation antigens and the pan-T lymphocyte surface antigen CD5 (Leu 1). As such, CLL generally may be considered a malignancy of the CD5 B cell, a minor B cell subpopulation implicated in the production of autoantibodies. Recent data indicate that CD5+ leukemic cells may express autoantibody-associated V region genes with little or no somatic mutation. We examined the Heavy chain V genes expressed by an unusual CLL that secretes rheumatoid factor (RF) autoantibodies but does not express the CD5 surface Ag. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the rearranged VH genes of three independent rDNA clones demonstrated intraclonal diversity not apparent in previously studied cases of CD5+ CLL. Comparison of the rearranged VH genes reveals that they belong to the VH4 gene subgroup and share highest homology with a rearranged VH gene (Ab44) that encodes a polyreactive autoantibody. That these productively rearranged VH genes encode the RF generated by this unusual CLL population is demonstrated by immunoblotting of the RF paraprotein using primary sequence dependent antipeptide antisera. These results indicate that CD5- CLL, like their CD5+ counterparts, may produce RF. However, unlike CD5+ CLL examined to date, CD5- CLL may have intraclonal diversity in their expressed Ig genes.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were cultured from multiple methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas under four different conditions: either low-dose (10 U/ml) or high-dose (1000 U/ml) rIL-2 was used with Ag stimulation by irradiated autologous tumor and splenocytes starting either at day 1 or day 10 of culture. TIL grown from four antigenically distinct sarcomas in low-dose rIL-2 were specifically lytic in vitro to their tumor of origin in 13 of 15 (87%) lytic cultures whereas only 8 of 28 (29%) lytic TIL cultures grown in high-dose rIL-2 showed specificity. TIL cultured in low-dose rIL-2 with Ag stimulation on day 1 of culture proliferated at a rate equal to TIL grown in high-dose rIL-2 and maintained their specificity for over 3 mo in culture. Cytolysis by specific TIL was MHC-restricted. TIL with in vitro specificity were therapeutically effective in eliminating established micrometastases in murine models. These investigations demonstrate that CTL derived from tumor-bearing mice can be used to define unique tumor-associated Ag on at least four different sarcomas and may be valuable in studies of the biologic nature of these Ag and in the adoptive immunotherapy of tumors.\r"

  ".U": "90154837\r", 
  ".W": "The interaction of two Burkitt lymphoma lines, Raji and Rael, with human C and NK cells was analyzed. Raji cells activate the alternative C pathway (ACP) and then bind C3 fragments. Consequently, the cells become more sensitive to lysis by CR3-bearing NK cells but not to C lysis. In contrast, Rael cells are poor ACP activators, do not bind C3 fragments, and are therefore resistant to C-dependent NK lysis. As suggested earlier, the difference between Raji and Rael could be attributed to the presence or absence of CR2, respectively, on their surface. To potentiate C- and NK-dependent lysis of target cells, we generated heteroconjugates composed of a murine antitransferrin receptor mAb and of human C C3b or iC3b. Antibody-C3b conjugates induced C3 deposition on Rael cells and elevated C3 deposition on Raji cells in human serum. Both Raji and Rael cells coated with antibody-C3b conjugates were efficiently lyzed by the cytolytic ACP in human serum. This conjugate had a small enhancing effect on target cell lysis by NK cells which could be markedly increased by combined treatment of the target cell with antibody-C3b conjugate and C5-depleted human serum. On the other hand, antibody-iC3b conjugates efficiently potentiated lysis of target cells by NK cells in the absence of serum. The iC3b-directed cytotoxicity was mediated by CR3-bearing NK effector cells. Anti-C3 but not anti-mouse Ig antibodies abrogated the activity of the antibody-iC3b conjugate. These results further demonstrate that NK cytotoxicity may be potentiated by opsonizing the target cells with C3 fragments and suggest that antibody-C3b/iC3b conjugates could be potent tools for targeting and potentiation of the lytic action of both C and NK cells against tumor cells.\r"

In addition CT detected asymmetry of the sylvian fissures or temporal horns in 10 patients, and MRI in eight patients. SPECT detected lateralising abnormalities in 19 patients (in five cases bilateral). It is concluded that low field MRI is superior to modified CT in demonstrating subtle structural lesions of the temporal lobe. Functional scanning with SPECT supports the evidence of origin of an epileptic focus in a substantial proportion of cases and may improve the selection of patients for surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The age and sex specific incidence rates for cerebral infarction, primary intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage in a population of approximately 105,000 are presented. Over four years 675 patients with a first-ever stroke were registered with the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. The pathological diagnosis was confirmed by computerised tomography (CT) scan, necropsy or lumbar puncture (cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage only) in 78% of cases and a further 17% were diagnosed according to the Guy's Hospital Stroke Diagnostic Score. The proportion of all first-ever strokes by pathological type was: cerebral infarction 81% (95% confidence interval 78-84), primary intracerebral haemorrhage 10% (8-12), subarachnoid haemorrhage 5% (3-7) and uncertain type 5% (3-7). These proportions are similar to other community-based studies. The overall 30 day case fatality rate was 19% (16-22), that for cerebral infarction being 10% (7-13), primary intracerebral haemorrhage 50% (38-62) and subarachnoid haemorrhage 46% (29-63). One year post stroke 23% (19-27) with cerebral infarction were dead and 65% (60-70) of survivors were functionally independent. The figures for primary intracerebral haemorrhage were 62% (43-81) dead and 68% (50-86) of survivors functionally independent and for subarachnoid haemorrhage were 48% (24-72) dead and 76% (56-96) of survivors functionally independent. There are important differences between these rates and those from other sources possibly due to more complete case ascertainment in our study. Nevertheless, the generally more optimistic early prognosis in our study, particularly for cases of cerebral infarction, has important implications for the planning of clinical trials and for the expected impact that any treatment might have on the general population.\r"

The rats often showed single rotatory curves affecting the thoracic and lumbar regions, although cases with multiple curves were also found. The severity of the scoliosis was closely related to a decrease in extracellular striatal dopamine measured with microdialysis and to the development of postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity, functionally evaluated with rotational behaviour elicited with apomorphine. Indeed, rats with the strongest dopamine depletion (greater than 95%) and the strongest rotational responses showed the sharpest spinal deviation and skeletal deformity. These findings agree with the clinical observations that scoliosis occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease and its direction is correlated with the side of the major signs and symptoms of parkinsonism.\r"

Half were in the Mundunga minority of less than or equal to 10% (p less than 0.001).

This jitter was found to depend on conduction time and strength of VRF, but not on propagation velocity. The results suggest that in the usual jitter study in voluntarily activated muscle fibre pairs, with moderately irregular discharge rate and interpotential intervals below 3 ms the IDI dependent jitter contributes on average less than 10 microseconds, but can be so large as to produce false abnormal values at more irregular rates, longer interpotential intervals and pronounced differences in VRF. It can be effectively removed by mathematical algorithms or, better still, by using electrical stimulation.\r"

The EMG pattern in standing subjects and patients consisted of short- and middle-latency responses (SL and ML) in the stretched triceps surae muscles and long-latency responses (LL) in the shortened tibialis anterior muscles. The SL response could be further divided into two distinct subcomponents termed SL1 and SL2. An ML response was identified in only 50% of normal subjects and patients. HD patients differed from normal subjects by showing delayed onset latencies and prolonged durations for the LL response, and smaller amplitudes for the ML response. The subjects at risk also showed diminished ML amplitudes and prolonged LL durations, but normal LL onset latencies. In the sitting condition, the EMG responses of the HD patients and of the HD risks did not differ from those of controls: in all groups SL1 was reduced and delayed, SL2 slightly enhanced, while ML and LL were absent. Because both afferent and efferent conduction times are normal in HD, the delayed LL onset reflects abnormal supraspinal organisation of postural control in HD, and indicates that basal ganglia may have a modulatory effect on the LL responses. The normal EMG responses in the sitting patients suggest appropriate regulation of these responses according to postural set in HD.\r"

The posterior commissure and its nucleus, the nucleus of Cajal, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and the pontine tegmentum were spared. We suggest that the unilateral riMLF lesion may have disrupted bilateral upgaze excitatory and inhibitory inputs and unilateral downgaze excitatory inputs. The functional anatomy of inhibitory and excitatory vertical gaze circuitry, which remains speculative, may explain why a unilateral lesion of the upper midbrain tegmentum may be sufficient to generate an upgaze palsy or a combined up- and downgaze palsy, while an isolated downgaze palsy requires bilateral lesions.\r"

Thermal vasodilation in the major portions of the face is regulated by sympathetic vasodilator fibres, and less predominantly by adrenergic vasoconstrictor fibres. The asymmetry of facial flushing may have been caused by impaired sympathetic vasodilation and further intensified by active vasoconstriction due to supersensitivity to circulating catecholamine on the affected side.\r"

Thirty-two of the colonized patients died in the first year following P. cepacia colonization compared to 8 of the control patients, a highly significant difference (p less than 0.001). In the second year, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups. Cases as a group had poorer pulmonary function and chest X-ray scores than controls up to 2 years before P. cepacia first appeared in their sputum or throat cultures. Regression analysis of pulmonary function tests (percent predicted FEV1 and RV/TLC) for each subject from 3 years before to 2 years after colonization revealed significant differences between cases and controls in slope for FEV1 and in slope and intercept for RV/TLC. When compared separately according to gender, the differences between cases and controls are significant in females but not in males. These results suggest that patients with poor pulmonary function are more prone to colonization with P. cepacia, that a subgroup of these patients will be dramatically affected and die within a year, and that the organism continues to exert a less dramatic negative effect on the pulmonary function of those patients who survive the initial acute effects of colonization, particularly in female patients.\r"

That apparent decline has been used to support a conclusion of an increase in smoking among younger individuals. However, in some cases the apparent decline is an artifact of the method of computation which arises when the quantity being averaged is related to a quantity used to classify subjects for comparison. In one other case, a second type of error arises because the distribution of smoking initiation with age changed in such a way that the proportion of individuals taking up smoking at older ages declined more rapidly than the proportion starting at younger ages. In fact, comparison of the 1970 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to the 1979/80 NHIS shows a uniform decrease in starting to smoke among teens and preteens. Examples are discussed which show that estimates of possible disease related factors actually experienced by a cohort are possible only if other suitable data are available for comparable representative sections of the population at different time periods and for different ages.\r"

Little has been said about the converse case in which selection is associated with decreased health status, the Sick Person Effect (SPE). The SPE may introduce a bias for some cohort, most clinical follow-up, and some case-control studies when risks are standardized against an inappropriate referent. We demonstrate the existence of the SPE in two studies. Study 1 compares the incidence of a number of different diseases among individuals who were selected as children for medical treatment with that among their siblings. Study 2 computes the Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SmRs) for various acute and chronic diseases for individuals who have reported particular chronic symptoms. The SPE is clearly apparent for all instances where the general population is taken as the referent. The HPE and SPE may present serious problems for the validity of conclusions with respect to risk levels.\r"

We examined WBC measured in prospective examinations of 2011 initially healthy men in the Normative Aging Study (mean age 47.5), followed for an average of 13.6 years with 27,402 man-years of observation. Between 1970 and 1987, 183 participants died. Mortality rates for men with baseline WBC over 9000 were 12.2/1000 man-years, 1.8-2.5 times those of men with lower WBC in each of three age groups. Proportional hazards models controlling for established risk factors including age, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking status, found WBC at the baseline exam to be an independent predictor of mortality over the following years. Even within the normal range, a difference of 1000 in the initial WBC increased the risk ratio by 1.2 (95% CI 1.1, 1.3). The relation of initial WBC to mortality was not affected by baseline age, body mass index (BMI), smoking or blood pressure. These findings are not explained by medication effects. We conclude that the WBC is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.\r"

Reports on ovarian number after the most recent surgery for a who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and 496 control subjects. We then calculated agreement rates by comparing the number of ovaries indicated by the medical record with the number reported by the woman. Agreement rates on the presence or absence of ovaries exceeded 90% for both case and control subjects. Agreement rates on exact ovarian number exceeded 84% for both groups. Women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer had slightly higher agreement rates than did control women for both presence or absence of ovaries and exact ovarian number. Our data suggest that investigators can rely on self-reported ovarian number as an accurate measure of actual ovarian number in women who have had surgery for nonmalignant conditions.\r"

In 42 patients, a discrete tumor was found and a selective adenomectomy was performed. Total hypophysectomy was performed in nine patients. In an attempt to preserve pituitary function, a technique of subtotal hypophysectomy was utilized in the remaining five patients. Regular and adequate follow-up results were obtained in 53 patients. A sustained remission was obtained in 45 of these 53 patients for a remission rate of 84.9%. Eight patients were classified as therapeutic failures. The causes for failure included: 1) invasive tumor; 2) hyperplasia mistaken for an adenoma; 3) a presumed ectopic source of adrenocorticotropic hormone; 4) misdiagnosis; 5) atypical tumor; and 6) recurrence of disease after remission. In cases of therapeutic failure, the original diagnosis of Cushing's disease must be reevaluated and treatment continued until sustained remission is achieved. Necessary measures to help avoid surgical failures and an approach for further diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers in these cases are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The controversy over whether to use a posterior or anterior approach for surgical treatment of soft cervical discs is still largely unsettled. However, although the posterior approach may be underutilized, it has distinct advantages when there are specific indications. Out of a large pool of cases, 53 patients presented with acute monoradiculopathy caused by soft cervical disc herniation. In 36 of these, the disc was sequestered (nonconfined) and was posterolateral to the disc space as seen on computerized tomography-myelography. Distinct motor weakness was a common clinical finding in all 36 cases. These patients were treated by using a 2- to 3-cm skin incision for the posterolateral microsurgical approach. The extent of the lateral facetectomy depended upon the relationship between the nerve root and the disc. All fragments were lateral to the dural sac and were sequestered through the anulus fibrosus and the posterior longitudinal ligament. Sequestrations were removed under direct microscopic vision, but the disc space was not entered. Pain relief and motor-power improvement in the affected radicular distribution were immediate in all patients. Sensory deficit and residual motor loss improved dramatically with normalization at approximately 6 months. No complications occurred and the mean hospital stay was 2 days. The follow-up period varied from 4 to 42 months with a mean of 26 months. Thus far, there have been no recurrences or other associated complications. By using strict selection criteria and a microsurgical posterolateral approach with removal of the sequestered disc fragment, excellent results with normalization of the monoradiculopathy can be obtained. The ease of this technique, low risk, minimal complications, and excellent results make it an attractive alternative to the anterior approach. The clinical presentations, specific indications, surgical technique, and clinical results are discussed; and a prototype of a small cervical self-retaining retractor is described.\r"

  ".U": "90155455\r", 
  ".W": "Lumbar-disc herniations that occur beneath or far lateral to the intervertebral facet joint are increasingly recognized as a cause of spinal nerve root compression syndromes at the upper lumbar levels. Failure to diagnose and precisely localize these herniations can lead to unsuccessful surgical exploration or exploration of the incorrect interspace. If these herniations are diagnosed, they often cannot be adequately exposed through the typical midline hemilaminectomy approach. Many authors have advocated a partial or complete unilateral facetectomy to expose these herniations, which can lead to vertebral instability or contribute to continued postoperative back pain. The authors present a series of 25 patients who were diagnosed as having far lateral lumbar disc herniations and underwent paramedian microsurgical lumbar-disc excision. Twelve of these were at the L4-5 level, six at the L5-S1 level, and seven at the L3-4 level. In these cases, myelography is uniformly normal and high-quality magnetic resonance images may not be helpful. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) appears to be the best study, but even this may be negative unless enhanced by performing CT-discography. Discography with enhanced CT is ideally suited to precisely diagnose and localize these far-lateral herniations. The paramedian muscle splitting microsurgical approach was found to be the most direct and favorable anatomical route to herniations lateral to the neural foramen. With this approach, there is no facet destruction and postoperative pain is minimal. Patients were typically discharged on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day. The clinical and radiographic characteristics of far-lateral lumbar-disc herniations are reviewed and the paramedian microsurgical approach is discussed.\r"

Superior axial T2-weighted MR images consistently localized the central sulcus, whereas parasagittal and farlateral sagittal images readily identified the rolandic (sensorimotor) cortex, as a functional unit, based on the cingulate-marginal sulcus and insula, respectively. It is therefore concluded that multiplanar MR images may serve as a useful preoperative planning aid prior to removing intrinsic brain tumors within or adjacent to the motor cortex.\r"

Attempts by the patients at voluntary muscle activation before intrathecal administration of baclofen led to considerable uncontrolled coactivation of antagonist and distant muscles. After the injection, dramatic suppression of the spastic signs was accompanied by more selective voluntary muscle activation. Tonic coactivation of the antagonists and distant muscle groups during voluntary contractions was decreased while the agonist level on electromyography (EMG) was not affected (three cases) or only slightly reduced (three cases). Furthermore, in one patient with sufficient residual motor control function, there was a considerable increase in the speed of fast isotonic movements, accompanied by the emergence of the ability to generate phasic muscle bursts on EMG that were characteristic of normal motor patterns. The results suggest that baclofen exerts different effects upon reflex pathways and descending motor pathways. This therapy appears to be a promising way for improving residual motor control in patients with increased muscle tone and/or reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "Baclofen, the most effective drug for treating spasticity, is a specific agonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptors, and is very abundant in the superficial layers of the spinal cord. Given orally, baclofen does not easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and is distributed equally to the brain and spinal cord. Direct intrathecal administration was given in order to change the distribution of the drug by preferentially perfusing the spinal cord. Eighteen patients presenting a severe spastic syndrome were treated with chronic intrathecal infusion of baclofen in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid. After clinical preselection, 38 patients were implanted with a lumbar access port allowing long-term trials in order to determine the efficacy of baclofen therapy and the effective 12-hour dose. The 18 patients selected for chronic administration were implanted with a programmable pump. The pathology in these cases was: multiple sclerosis (6 cases), posttrauma spastic syndrome (eight cases), and (one case each) cerebral palsy, ischemic cerebral lesion, spinal ischemia, and transverse myelitis. The mean follow-up period was 18 months (range 4 to 43 months). The clinical results were evaluated according to muscular hypertony on Ashworth's scale (changed for occurrence of painful spasms) and functional improvement. Results were better for spastic syndrome secondary to traumatic medullary lesion than for demyelinating disease. Hypertonia was improved in all cases as confirmed by the registration of the Hoffman (H) reflex. Painful muscular spasms disappeared in 14 of the 16 affected patients. Significant functional improvement was noted in nine patients and was considerable in three. The risk of side effects secondary to overdose (such as excessive hypotonia or central depression) and the absence of a specific baclofen antagonist stresses the necessity for accurate determination of the efficient dose. After an initial titration period and adjustment of the therapeutic dose, the individual doses were from 21 to 500 micrograms/24 hrs (mean 160 micrograms/24 hrs). This new conservative method is very effective, perfectly reversible, and safe when administered in conditions favorable to its use.\r"

The pattern seen most often was a focus of high signal (on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images) surrounded by a larger zone of low signal (best seen on T2-weighted images), and was remarkably similar for all patients. Six patients underwent surgical exploration; removal of the lesions halted the progression of symptoms in five patients, and one patient had worsened sensory function after surgery. Motor function did not decrease postoperatively in any patient. The one patient who refused surgery has continued to decline neurologically. Histopathological examination of surgical specimens showed a cavernous malformation in one patient, a venous malformation in one, venous varices in two, and organizing hematomas in two; these findings are markedly different from those in previously reported cases of cryptic vascular malformations.\r"

Tumor histology was reviewed individually and grouped into three categories (Categories I to III) for survival analysis. An overall 5-year survival rate of 44.6% was obtained after the exclusion of perioperative mortality. Factors associated with an improved 5-year survival rate were: total tumor removal, noninvasive tumors, Category I histology, age greater than 6 years, and absent physical signs of parenchymal invasion or lower cranial nerve involvement. The 5-year survival rate was lower when associated with Category III histology, brain-stem or cranial nerve signs, age less than 2 years, tumor invasion and/or cranial nerve involvement, and subtotal tumor removal. Clinical evidence of spinal metastases was found to be uncommon (3.1%). Surgical excision followed by radiation therapy was the primary mode of treatment for these tumors. Different approaches regarding the volume of radiotherapy to be delivered and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) suggests that serious morbidity associated with AVM's in functional areas is likely to be much greater than in silent areas. Various modes of treatment of AVM's in functional areas, including direct surgical intervention, embolization, and irradiation, have been considered to carry high risks. The authors advocate direct surgical intervention to these AVM's via a microsurgical technique based on knowledge of the hemodynamic anatomy of AVM's. The technique is designed to circumscribe the AVM without removing any surrounding cortical tissue or white matter and to preserve microcirculation in the functional area. Controlled hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure 40 to 60 mm Hg) is appropriate to enhance the safety of surgical procedures without causing metabolic and electrophysiological dysfunction. Another means to prevent neurological complications is multi-staged resection of larger AVM's, which permits obliteration compartment by compartment. This technique has the advantage of maintaining circulatory sufficiency in the functional area. There was no mortality among 56 patients who underwent the surgical procedure described. Of those, 55 patients resumed their preoperative occupation and one patient became self-sufficient.\r"

The object was to determine whether a mathematical model could be developed enabling a prediction to be made at the time of the initial assessment as to the probability of success or failure of conservative management using the halo vest alone, and thus perhaps avoid lengthy, unsuccessful treatment. Patients with facet joint dislocation were found to form a distinct subgroup of the injury population. Of the 70 patients in this subgroup, 44% achieved stability with the halo vest alone, but half of these had a \"poor anatomical result.\" No mathematical model or associated injury features could be found to assist in the outcome prediction in this subgroup. Of the 103 patients without facet joint dislocation, 70% achieved stability with the vest alone and over 75% of these had a \"good anatomical result.\" A useful model of outcome prediction was found for this subgroup by logistic regression analysis; the two most important predictors in the model were the amount of subluxation and the degree of angulation in the sagittal plane.\r"

The findings were compared with those identified in a chick myeloschisis experimental model and in human autopsy cases. The experimental model of exencephaly in chick embryos was developed by induction with various teratogens including ethylnitrosourea, salicylate, and phenytoin. None of the cases of exencephaly was exposed to a teratogen prior to or within Hamburger and Hamilton stage 12 (45 to 49 hours postincubation), when the anterior neuropore closes. The process of overgrowth in development of exencephaly was identical to that of myeloschisis, and the results suggested neuronal overmaturation in the histological and immunohistochemical studies. Although the late-stage degenerative change with neovascularization over the exposed neural tissue (placode) was more severe in human exencephaly, the present experimental study may suggest a possible common embryopathogenesis of dysraphism. Exencephaly should be regarded as the most severe form of cranium bifidum, as myeloschisis is in spina bifida.\r"

The antibody simultaneously recognized two different molecules, the CD3 complex on effector T cells and a human glioma-associated antigen; thus, it could cross-link effector and target cells. This bispecific F(ab')2 fragment induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) from healthy donors to lyse cells of the human glioma cell line, U251MG, which are resistant to natural killer cell-mediated cytolysis. The effect of the bispecific antibody on lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity was tested in patients suffering from malignant glioma. For this study, PBMC's from these patients were preactivated with recombinant interleukin-2 and their killer activity against U251MG cells was investigated in vitro with and without the bispecific antibody. The LAK cell activity of the PBMC's from patients with malignant gliomas was found to be suppressed compared with those of healthy donors. However, after preincubation with bispecific antibody, the patients' LAK cells exhibited marked cytolytic activity against U251MG cells. These findings suggest that this bispecific antibody may be a useful addition to anti-glioma immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The fiberoptic device is a relatively new type of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor which appears to offer certain advantages over conventional monitoring systems, particularly its ability to measure brain parenchymal pressures. This study was undertaken to analyze the accuracy and drift characteristics of the fiberoptic device and to compare pressures in the subdural, intraparenchymal, and intraventricular compartments. The device was accurate to +/- 3 mm Hg over a 0- to 30-mm Hg range in vitro. The maximum daily drift was +/- 2.5 mm Hg, with an average daily drift of +/- 0.6 mm Hg and an average drift over a 5-day period of +/- 2.1 mm Hg. In vivo, the pressures and waveform characteristics obtained with the fiberoptic device and with a strain-gauge transducer connected to a ventriculostomy were very similar. Alterations in ICP were induced by various therapeutic and pathological manipulations, and the pressures in the three intracranial compartments were compared. Changes in ICP appeared to be reflected simultaneously and equally in all three compartments. Furthermore, changes in ICP secondary to a unilateral mass lesion were identical in both supratentorial parenchymal compartments when measured simultaneously. It is concluded that the fiberoptic device is an accurate and reliable system for ICP monitoring; the pressures recorded in the subdural, intraparenchymal, and intraventricular compartments paralleled each other in all of the physiological and pathological states tested. Although the drift associated with this device is less than that reported for previously available systems, its maximal cumulative drift over a 5-day period of +/- 6 mm Hg is significant. Since the fiberoptic device cannot be recalibrated in situ, it is suggested that the device be replaced if monitoring is to be continued for periods longer than 5 days.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of various n-6/n-3 (0.45-9.31) and polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S; 0.25-6.08) ratios of dietary fatty acids on various lipid parameters were studied in rats using a combination of palm oil, safflower oil, soybean oil and perilla oil. When the n-6/n-3 ratio was changed while maintaining a constant P/S ratio (1.2), the concentration of serum cholesterol tended to increase linearly with the increasing n-6/n-3 ratio, whereas liver cholesterol tended to decrease. Serum triglyceride level increased linearly up to a n-6/n-3 ratio of approximately 5, whereas liver triglyceride was not influenced. When the n-6/n-3 ratio was kept relatively constant (5.6-6.4), serum and liver cholesterol levels decreased up to a P/S ratio of approximately 2, whereas serum triglyceride tended to be low below this value. The ratio of arachidonate to linoleate in tissue phosphatidylcholine (PC) was also influenced by the n-6/n-3 and P/S ratios; it increased up to a n-6/n-3 ratio of approximately 4, whereas it decreased up to a P/S ratio of approximately 2. The percentage of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (n-3) in tissue phosphatidylcholine was positively related to dietary n-3 fatty acid levels. Prostacyclin (PGI2) production by thoracic aorta reached a plateau at a n-6/n-3 ratio approximately 5, whereas it tended to decrease with an increasing P/S ratio. Platelet production of thromboxane A2 exhibited a parabola-like pattern with a peak value at a n-6/n-3 ratio of approximately 2, whereas it was independent of the P/S ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diet had no effect on growth or enzyme activity. Diet had a significant (P less than 0.05) effect on the concentration of free proline in plasma, liver, intestine and muscle, but no effect in kidney. These data suggest that the magnitude and pattern of change of P5C reductase activity is not influenced by the concentration of proline in the diet. The lower plasma and tissue free proline concentrations in the piglets fed the basal diet compared with piglets fed the proline-supplemented diet and the lack of effect of diet on enzyme activity suggest there was inadequate proline in the basal diet, and those piglets were unable to increase proline synthesis to maintain normal proline concentrations.\r"

  ".U": "90155523\r", 
  ".W": "Cyst(e)ine was metabolized by rat enterocytes to pyruvate and inorganic sulfur but not to taurine. Cystine was the major extracellular form of cyst(e)ine present during the incubation, and addition of bathocuproine disulfonate, a copper chelator that maintained 60% of the total cyst(e)ine in the sulfhydryl form, had no effect on total sulfur release from cyst(e)ine. Oxidation of cyst(e)ine to 35SO4(2-) or 14CO2 was reduced by about 50% when unlabeled cysteinesulfinate was added to incubations of enterocytes with labeled cyst(e)ine. Thus, about one half of cyst(e)ine metabolism appeared to involve its oxidation to cysteinesulfinate and the transamination of cysteinesulfinate to the putative intermediate sulfinylpyruvate, which decomposes to yield sulfite and pyruvate. The remainder of cyst(e)ine catabolism in enterocytes appeared to involve release of sulfur from cyst(e)ine prior to its oxidation. Inhibition of gamma-cystathionase by propargylglycine, although incomplete, resulted in substantial inhibition of cyst(e)ine catabolism. The accumulation of cysteinethiosulfonate, which forms nonenzymatically upon incubation of cyst(e)ine with thiosulfate, and the inhibition of cysteinethiosulfonate formation by propargylglycine demonstrated the catabolism of cyst(e)ine by beta-cleavage catalyzed by gamma-cystathionase. Sulfide released from cyst(e)ine in this reaction appeared to be oxidized to thiosulfate before it was further oxidized to sulfite and sulfate. In addition to being oxidized to sulfate, some of the sulfite formed by enterocytes reacted with cyst(e)ine in the incubation medium to form sulfocysteine. Activities of enzymes of cyst(e)ine catabolism in rat enterocytes corresponded with the observed metabolism of cyst(e)ine by various pathways.\r"

After a 4-wk folate depletion period, rats were fed for an additional 4 wk basal diets with or without 0.5% phthalylsulfacetamide and with 100, 200 or 300 g of wheat bran; or 50, 100 or 150 g of xylan; or 0, 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 mg of folic acid added per kg of basal diet. Xylan increased both liver and fecal folate, and this effect was nearly eliminated by phthalylsulfacetamide. Wheat bran contributed 1.6 micrograms of available folate per g of wheat bran without phthalylsulfacetamide in an apparently valid slope-ratio analysis. With the addition of phthalylsulfacetamide, liver folate increased in rats fed wheat bran diets and decreased in rats fed folic acid diets. The slope-ratio analysis for wheat bran folate with phthalylsulfacetamide became invalid due to a lack of intersection. Phthalylsulfacetamide had no effect on fecal folate excretion from rats fed the wheat bran diets. Further studies are needed on a variety of foods with and without phthalylsulfacetamide to evaluate the effect and importance of intestinal folate synthesis in the rat.\r"

Food intake (15.6 +/- 0.3 g/d, mean +/- SEM; n = 28) and body weight (190 +/- 2 and 290 +/- 5 g at wk 0 and 5, respectively; n = 28) of control groups were not different from those of deficient groups throughout the study. After 2 wk of vitamin B-6 depletion, tissue concentrations of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) were about 50% and 10-40% lower, respectively, in the deficient than in the control group (except for spleen PMP); in plasma and erythrocytes, PLP and pyridoxal concentrations were about 90% lower in the deficient group. Differences in vitamer concentrations between control and deficient groups were not larger after 4 wk of depletion than after 2 wk. Vitamer concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes and all tissues returned to control levels after 1 wk of repletion with the control diet. These results demonstrate that B-6 vitamers in blood and tissues of the rat respond quickly and reversibly to changes in dietary vitamin B-6, with larger percentage changes occurring in plasma and erythrocytes than in tissues.\r"

Erythrocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide nucleotide phosphate (NADP), activity of nicotinic acid mononucleotide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMNPRT), plasma tryptophan levels and the urinary excretion of organic acids were measured during dietary periods of low (6.1 or 10.1), adequate (19) and high (25 or 32) NE intake. With both low NE diets, NAD levels in erythrocytes decreased by approximately 70% and increased during repletion with an adequate NE diet. NADP levels remained relatively unchanged. Plasma tryptophan levels decreased by 40% and 10% in subjects ingesting diets of 6.1 and 10.1 NE/d, respectively. A daily 7.8-g leucine supplement during repletion was not associated with changes in plasma tryptophan levels or erythrocyte NAD and NADP levels at the end of the period. No changes in NMNPRT activity or organic acid excretion were found during the study. The results indicate that the erythrocyte NAD level may serve as a sensitive indicator for the assessment of niacin status. Also, a niacin index, the ratio of erythrocyte NAD to NADP, below 1.0 may identify subjects at risk of developing a niacin deficiency.\r"

Weanling rats were moderately depleted of folate in 28 d with a folate-free purified diet based on 17% amino acids as the nitrogen source. They were then folate repleted for 23 d with the amino acid diet supplemented with either 125, 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 micrograms folic acid/kg. Hematology, growth and tissue folate levels were measured in subsets of the rats when they were 24 (baseline), 52 (depleted) and 75 d old (repleted). The same measurements were made in control rats that had been fed 2 mg folic acid/kg of the amino acid diet for the same period of time. Our findings show that with repletion, growth of previously depleted rats is in direct proportion with the level of supplementation up to 1000 micrograms folic acid/kg diet. Serum folate levels of repleted rats also increased in proportion to supplementation between 500 to 2000 micrograms/kg diet, and liver folate levels increased proportionally with the level of supplement within the range of 125 to 2000 micrograms/kg diet. The 2000 micrograms/kg supplement was sufficient to restore liver folate levels equivalent to that of controls, but body weight and serum folate levels failed to catch up with that of controls in the 23-d repletion period. There was a nonlinear relationship between serum and liver folate levels: serum folate remained constant at about 6 micrograms/l as liver folate increased to about 7 micrograms/g, then serum folate diverged by increasing to 120 micrograms/l with only minor increases in liver folate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were then injected with 75Se of the same chemical form and killed 2 d later. Tissue deposition of stable and radiotracer selenium and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were used to assess selenium utilization. Erythrocyte levels of selenium and GSHPx were lower in vitamin B-6--deficient animals for all forms of selenium; however, 75Se deposition in erythrocytes was not affected by vitamin B-6 status. The activities of cystathionine lyase, aspartate aminotransferase and selenocysteine lyase were lower in livers of vitamin B-6--deficient rats than in vitamin B-6--supplemented rats. The proportion of liver and kidney 75Se soluble in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol was consistently lower in vitamin B-6--deficient animals, but cation-exchange chromatography of tissue extracts did not identify a specific low-molecular-weight species. Tissue retention of 75Se provided as SeMet was increased in vitamin B-6--deficient animals, but the proportion of 75Se retained in muscle and liver as SeCys was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that the conversion of SeMet to a form available for GSHPx synthesis is reduced by vitamin B-6 deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "While regulation of intestinal transporters is established for other nutrients, evidence concerning regulation of intestinal vitamin transport is scanty. Hence, we compared intestinal pantothenic acid (PA) uptake in mice fed diets with high, normal and deficient PA levels. PA uptake is distributed along the small intestine, Na(+)-dependent and saturable. Signs of PA deficiency were weight loss or reduced growth, then hair loss and exudation around the eyes, then diarrhea and hindleg paralysis and splenomegaly, and finally death. Treatment of mice with an antibiotic was found to be necessary to elicit severe signs of PA deficiency, probably because mice normally can obtain PA synthesized by intestinal bacteria. Dietary PA levels had no effect on intestinal PA uptake at 5 microM. A small increase in the Vmax of uptake, observed in late-stage deficiency, is probably too small to be physiologically significant. Comparison with published results for other water-soluble vitamins suggests that intestinal transporters may be regulated only for vitamins absorbed predominantly by carrier-mediated transport and subject to natural deficiency states.\r"

Sows (n = 18) were fed a purified diet containing 0.6 mg folate/kg diet and either 25 (Fe-) or 125 (Fe+) mg iron/kg diet throughout gestation and lactation. Litters were culled to eight on d 2 of lactation and four piglets/litter were given an intramuscular injection of iron dextran (100 mg/kg body wt). Plasma and red blood cell folate concentrations among all sows decreased (greater than 50%) after conception (P less than 0.001). Plasma folate concentration of Fe- sows was 47% and 69% of Fe+ sows on d 7 and 21 of lactation, respectively (P less than 0.05). All sows secreted milk that contained low levels of folate (12-36 nmol/l) and was devoid of long-chain folylpolyglutamates. While mean milk folate concentration significantly decreased after d 1 of lactation among Fe- sows, no such decrease was observed in milk from Fe+ sows (P less than 0.05). Liver folate concentration was significantly reduced in piglets nursed by Fe- sows and given intramuscular iron dextran. It is concluded that there is an increased dietary requirement for folate and iron during reproduction in swine, and that current recommended amounts of folate (0.6 mg/kg diet) and iron (80 mg/kg diet) may be underestimates of requirements for reproduction. Further, results show that iron nutrition may alter folate utilization in maternal and neonatal swine.\r"

A dietary requirement may relate to the activity and developmental changes of the enzymes that synthesize and degrade proline. The activity of pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase (EC 1.5.1.2), which catalyzes the final step in proline synthesis, and proline oxidase (EC number not assigned), which catalyzes the initial step in proline degradation, were measured in four piglet tissues from birth through to the postweaning period. There were significant changes in the activity of P5C reductase with age, but the magnitude and direction of change were dependent upon age and tissue type. Compared to literature values for the rat [5.1-82.4 mumol/(min.g tissue)], the activity was low in the piglet [1.3-18.6 mumol/(min.g tissue)]. The activity of proline oxidase was low in the piglet [0-0.6 mumol/(min.g tissue)] compared to literature values for the rat [0-5.3 mumol/(min.g tissue)] and low compared to P5C reductase [1.3-18.6 mumol/(min.g tissue)], indicating that further decreases in the activity of proline oxidase would not provide the piglet with a mechanism for conserving proline if dietary supply were limiting.\r"

At weaning, well-fed males were either housed in pairs (standard condition, SC) or 12 per large cage with toys (enriched condition, EC) and fed a 17% protein diet (SC control and EC control, respectively). Malnourished pups were fed either a 17% (rehabilitation; \"rehab\") or a 6% (low protein) protein diet and housed in the SC or EC environment (SC rehab, EC rehab, SC low protein, and EC low protein). After 30 d there were no differences in hematocrit, serum total protein and albumin levels between SC and EC animals. Rehab rats had significantly lower serum total protein and albumin levels than did controls. Cortical thickness and dendritic branching of occipital cortex pyramidal cells were evaluated. Early malnutrition did not permanently affect cortical thickness. EC rehab rats had thicker cortices than did SC rehab rats at almost all locations measured. SC rehab rats had fewer high order dendrites than did SC controls. The difference in dendritic branching between EC and SC rats was 44% among rehab rats, 21% among controls and 11% (not significant) among low protein-fed rats. Environmental enrichment during nutritional rehabilitation enhances dendritic branching and thickness of the occipital cortex.\r"

An increase in the amount of immunoreactive alkaline phosphatase antigen was also found to be associated with the increased enzyme activity in CEIR mice. These results suggest that a specific induction of an intestinal enzyme occurs or, alternatively, that there is a specific relative decrease in synthesis of intestinal proteins other than IAP as a function of CEIR. Thus, CEIR appears to regulate the expression of proteins in the small intestine in a specific manner.\r"

An oral dose of castanospermine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg body wt) dose-dependently reduced sucrase activity of intestinal segments by 15-90%; 0.4 mg/kg body wt reduced total sucrase activity about 50%. The lower doses inhibited sucrase much more extensively in the proximal than in the distal segments. Castanospermine also dose-dependently reduced the 0-3 h glycemic response to sucrose; 1.5 mg/kg body wt reduced the glycemic response about 50%. Each submaximal castanospermine dose inhibited total sucrase activity more than it reduced the glycemic response. We conclude that intestinal sucrase activity in the rat is in modest excess relative to the rate-determining step of glucose absorption following sucrose administration. Fourteen days of castanospermine treatment (0.2 mg.kg body wt-1.d-1) resulted in sucrase inhibition that was similar to a single castanospermine treatment, suggesting that castanospermine treatment resulted in neither cumulative sucrase inhibition nor induction of sucrase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary energy restriction prolongs life-span and enhances immune responsiveness by mechanisms yet to be elucidated. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has a suppressive effect on several parameters of cell-mediated immunity. The effect of energy restriction on splenic PGE2 synthesis in Emory mice was studied. Weanling Emory mice were fed an energy-restricted (R, 71.3 kcal/wk) or control (NR, 90.8 kcal/wk) diet for 11-14 mo. The final weights of R mice were 66% of weights of NR mice (27 +/- 1 vs. 41 +/- 1 g for females and 34 +/- 1 vs. 51 +/- 1 g for males, for R and NR, respectively). NR female mice had higher spleen PGE2 levels than NR male mice (698 +/- 64 vs. 522 +/- 47 ng/mg protein, P = 0.03). In all cases, R mice had less PGE2 than NR mice, and there was no sex-related difference in R mice (418 +/- 39 vs. 698 +/- 64 ng/mg protein in R and NR females, P = 0.001 and 416 +/- 39 vs. 522 +/- 47 ng/mg protein in R and NR males, P = .009). Total spleen PGE2 was also reduced significantly by energy restriction; however, gender differences were not observed in total spleen PGE2 level of NR mice. Thus, 1) spleens from female mice synthesize more PGE2/mg protein than do those from male mice, and 2) dietary energy restriction reduces ex vivo spleen PGE2 synthesis. This phenomenon may contribute to the observed immunostimulatory effect of dietary energy restriction in mice.\r"

Glutamine and alanine were the major amino acid precursors of glucose, contributing 9.8% and 10.6% of the glucose formed, respectively, in hepatocytes isolated from starved rats. Serine, glycine and threonine also contributed to gluconeogenesis in the starved liver cells at 2.6, 2.1 and 3.8%, respectively, of the glucose formed. The rate of glucose formation from the isolated hepatocytes of the starved rats and those fed either high protein or high fat was higher than that from rats fed a nonpurified diet.\r"

Saccharin-induced stimulation of intake was usually not so pronounced during the first week as during subsequent weeks of each experiment. Similar results were obtained using diets high in starch and fat. However, these effects could be obliterated by simply exposing the rats to unsweetened (plain) diet or to saccharin in water for several days before the sweetened diets were introduced. Furthermore, although stimulation of intake by saccharin was observed with diets containing 80% water, no such effect was observed with a diet containing 60% water. Rats given low-energy sweetened water in addition to their 80% water diet consumed substantially more fluid but not more or less energy than rats given unsweetened water. Preference tests suggest that saccharin increases diet palatability only very slightly; this finding is one of several observations suggesting that stimulation of intake by saccharin cannot be interpreted in terms of increased diet palatability. These results suggest that dietary hyperphagia results from the interaction between innate and learned responses to the taste of foods. Osmotic factors did not seem to exert a major influence in these experiments.\r"

Increased vitamin D intake resulted in increased plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, whereas high dietary calcium decreased concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D.

We examined the possibility that changes in BCAA concentrations in blood and brain might serve as modulators of protein consumption. After young rats had adjusted to selecting between a 10% or 25% casein diet and a 50% casein diet, a mixture of BCAA was included in the diet containing the lower amount of protein (10% + BCAA, 25% + BCAA). Supplementation of the 10% or 25% casein diets with BCAA and subsequent elevation of BCAA concentrations in plasma and brain were associated with increased selection of protein in rats given the 10% + BCAA/50% casein diet choice, but not in rats offered the 25% + BCAA/50% casein diets. When no alternative diet was available, addition of BCAA to a 15% casein diet depressed food intake, and rats given a choice between a 15% casein diet with or without added BCAA selected almost exclusively the diet without added BCAA. Although BCAA concentrations were high in plasma and brain in all experiments, concentrations of methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and histidine were low in brain in experiments in which rats altered their diet or protein selection after BCAA addition. High concentrations of BCAA in plasma and brain were not consistently associated with changes in protein selection.\r"

Folates from methionine-deficient rats contained more nearly equal amounts, on a molar basis, of folylpenta- and hexaglutamates, and hence these were more suitable subjects for comparing the metabolism of these compounds in vivo. Livers from methionine-deficient rats contained H4PteGlu5 (30%), 5-methyl-H4PteGlu5 (13%), 10-formyl-H4PteGlu5 (10%), H4PteGlu6 (22%), 5-methyl-H4PteGlu6 (9%) and 10-formyl-H4PteGlu6 (11%). With exposure to N2O, 5-methyl-H4PteGlu5 and 6 increased to 27% and 13%, respectively, whereas H4PteGlu5 and 6 decreased to 20% and 17%, respectively. Nitrous oxide (N2O) perturbed both the penta- and hexaglutamates; the effect was somewhat more pronounced with the pentaglutamates. The partial depletion in tissue H4PteGlun with N2O treatment helps explain the concomitant inhibition of the oxidation of [ring-14C]histidine, an event dependent on tetrahydrofolates.\r"

In the rats, peak serum accumulation of [14C]retinol occurred 4 h after a single oral dose, but we were not able to detect [14C]beta-carotene in rat sera at any time up to 72 h after dosing. Small amounts of [14C]beta-carotene were found in the livers, although 88-94% of the recovered radioactivity was localized in the retinol fraction after saponification. Although radioactivity was also found in fractions other than beta-carotene and retinol, the amounts were too small to allow characterization. In the monkeys, peak accumulation of [14C]retinol in serum occurred between 8 and 24 h after supplementation. Some [14C]beta-carotene was also present. Most of the absorbed radioactivity was stored in the liver as [14C]retinol, although 2-8% was present as [14C]beta-carotene. Other organs also contained [14C]beta-carotene, confirming the ability of the monkey to absorb intact beta-carotene. In addition, monkey livers and other organs were found to contain lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha-cryptoxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene, presumably arising from dietary sources.\r"

Beginning 4 d after birth of pups, dams were fed a diet low in copper (Cu) (0.4 mg/kg) and offspring were weaned to this diet at 21 d of age. Half the dams and their respective offspring received Cu (20 micrograms/ml) in the drinking water (+Cu) and served as controls. Unsupplemented offspring (-Cu) had lower liver Cu levels, exhibited anemia, and had increased heart weights but normal body weights compared to +Cu mice. Urinary output of norepinephrine and dopamine was higher, whereas output of creatinine and epinephrine was not different in -Cu mice compared to +Cu mice. Both fractional and calculated turnover of norepinephrine following inhibition of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase by alpha-methyl-p-DL-tyrosine methyl ester (alpha-MT) was higher in hearts from -Cu mice than in those from +Cu mice. Hearts and spleens from -Cu mice appeared to have higher tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity as judged by increasing rates of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation following injection of m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015), an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. Turnover rates of norepinephrine for cerebellum were not different between +Cu and -Cu mice. Loss of norepinephrine from adrenal glands of mice injected with alpha-MT was not observed in the 8-h period studied. The smaller norepinephrine pool observed in organs of -Cu mice may have resulted from lower synthesis due to limiting dopamine-beta-monooxygenase activity and to higher turnover.\r"

In one experiment, rats were fed diets containing, either alone or in combination, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene or coenzyme Q10 for 42 d, and the extent of spontaneous and induced lipid peroxidation was determined by release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) into the medium. Vitamin E exhibited the greatest protection against lipid peroxidation in liver, heart and spleen; in kidney, selenium was most protective. Coenzyme Q10 was active against lipid peroxidation induced by tertbutyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). In a second experiment, rats were fed diets containing varying amounts of vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene and coenzyme Q10 for 30 d. Spontaneous lipid peroxidation in liver, kidney and heart decreased with increasing levels of dietary antioxidants. With increasing amounts of antioxidants, there was a diminution in TBARS released by liver and kidney slices incubated with t-BHP; in heart, only the highest levels of antioxidants significantly decreased production of TBARS. Inverse correlations between dietary vitamin E and TBARS, tissue vitamin E and TBARS, and tissue selenium-glutathione peroxidase and TBARS were highly significant. The procedure used here can evaluate dietary supplements that may find practical applications in decreasing the oxidant radical portion of disease processes.\r"

In such a practice, learning centers on resident-patient interactions, around which a comprehensive teaching program must be built. Major features of such a program include the mentoring of residents by faculty who work with them longitudinally and the presence of a well-balanced structured curriculum addressing clinical and nonclinical topics related to patient care. Teaching residents to interact and communicate with patients is crucial; approaches include role-modeling by faculty, use of videotaping, and role-playing and other innovative methods. Feedback is integral to learning and helps shape the attitudes and values that permeate residents' practices.\r"

In the last several decades, however, it has become increasingly reductionist, fragmented, and specialized. Recent developments, as exemplified by the return of the generalist clinician-educator to the academic community, portend a reversal of this trend. Manifestations of a change in the orientation of medicine and medical education toward bolism and bumanism include a movement toward improved compensation for \"cognitive\" services, development of new promotion tracks for clinician-teachers, and increased support and recognition of applied clinical research. Generalist faculty are in a position to benefit from these trends, but obstacles remain; vigilism and activism are required to maintain momentum.\r"

A model is presented for residency education that reorganizes the service and education components. First, they present a broad overview of the conflict. Then they provide a brief historical perspective and comment on some of the current recommendations for residency programs. Next, they discuss how principles of adult learning relate to residency and propose a new model of residency that adheres more closely to these principles. Finally, the proposed model is presented in some detail and its implications are discussed. Only if the service and education components of residency are carefully delineated can residency programs adapt to the changing and growing needs of postgraduate medical education.\r"

A comprehensive theory of traumatic trigeminal pain is proposed based on three sites of pathosis: peripheral neuroma, somatic and autonomic collateralization, and central deafferentation pathoses. Anesthesia dolorosa is related in this model to amputation neuromas and central pathosis. Sympathetic mediated pain is attributed to autonomic C-fiber units in peripheral injured zones. Hyperalgesia is attributed to mechanosensitive A-fiber units in the nerves being linked to corresponding irritable central nervous system neurons. Hyperpathia is explained on the basis of ephaptic transmission between adjacent fibers in neuromas.\r"

The extent of bone involvement is therefore a critical factor in planning treatment. To evaluate whether uptake of 99mTc-DPC (dicarboxypropane-diphosphate) was reliable in demonstrating the extent of mandibular involvement, 13 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the mandibular gingiva, floor of the mouth, and lower buccal sulcus were studied. Bone involvement, as judged from preoperative radiographs and bone scans, was compared with that determined through careful analysis of histologic sections of jaw specimens. The bone scan findings corresponded well with the histologic findings in 10 cases. In contrast to earlier studies, there were no false-positive findings. False-negative bone scans were seen in three cases in which there was infiltration of the upper cortex of the mandible. A negative bone scan, therefore, cannot guarantee absence of bone involvement. Nevertheless, bone scanning seems to provide valuable information for preoperative evaluation of evident tumor infiltration of bone.\r"

This study reports the microscopic observations of implant and control sites at 6 and 18 months postsurgery. The results confirm the biocompatibility of dense HA granules. Specimens exhibited differing degrees of osseous regeneration that appeared related to the percent composition of HA. At 18 months, 86% and 91% of the HA granules were completely surrounded by bone in those specimens reconstructed with implants consisting of 25% and 50% HA, respectively. In contrast, specimens receiving implants consisting of 75% and 100% HA features osseous encapsulation of 75% and 66% of the granules, respectively. The results of this limited study indicate that dense HA granules mixed with AB in ratios ranging from 3:1 to 1:1 (AB:HA) may be successfully used as a bone extender during reconstructive surgery.\r"

Serum chemistry tests including calcium, phosphorus, ionized calcium, and PTH levels should routinely be obtained when a giant cell lesion is suspected. A case of benign, aggressive, multifocal central giant cell lesions of the maxillofacial skeleton, in the absence of either primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism is presented.

High-risk sexual and drug using behaviors in adolescents should be viewed within a developmental perspective, focusing on cognitive development (Piaget), psychosocial development (Erikson), and moral development in males (Kohlberg), females (Gilligan), and children (Damon). Public health educators have emphasized the high-risk behaviors of unsafe sex and needle sharing, with considerably less attention given to the role of alcohol and other drug intoxication in the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Adolescents are often uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their partners. Therefore, alcohol or other drugs may be used to reduce sexual anxiety. Such drug use prior to sexual activity may impair judgment, and risks may be taken that might not have been taken in a more sober condition.\r"

Gay men and women appear to have a higher incidence of substance abuse than the general population. Genetic, biochemical, societal, and cultural factors may all contribute to this increase, especially the overwhelming impact of societal homophobia. To address the treatment barriers to gay and bisexual men seeking or needing treatment for HIV-related conditions, chemical dependence or both, the gay community should be seen like any other minority community. The social and cultural norms of this widely varied community should be studied: the socialization of being gay in mainstream society, including the awareness of being different; the coming-out process; and dealing with internalized homophobia need to be understood. In addition, the resistance or anxiety health care providers may feel in working with gay or bisexual men or with HIV-related conditions should be addressed.\r"

Chemically dependent women may not only give birth to drug-affected infants but they may also perpetuate an intergenerational cycle of inadequate parenting. Most women at risk for HIV infection are in their childbearing years. Infection of either or both mother and infant further complicates an already complex problem.

The terms \"low incidence\" and \"high incidence\" can be misleading: If one state compares its AIDS cases to another state, the comparison may indeed show a comparatively low incidence of AIDS. However, if the comparison is made with other diseases within the same state, a quite different picture may emerge. In low-incidence states, some individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may seek medical care from physicians who have more experience in treating AIDS cases, both because of a perception of better medical care and less stigmatization. Although the numbers may be relatively small, the number of HIV/AIDS patients seeking care in large metropolitan areas may add to the health care burden already being seen in some parts of the country.\r"

Reasons to offer voluntary HIV testing in chemical dependence treatment programs include: appropriate medical evaluation and treatment, prevention of the spread of HIV infection, and support for working through the crisis of a positive diagnosis. Voluntary informed consent should be obtained prior to HIV testing; involuntary testing and mass screening are not justified. Testing decisions should be individualized, with the focus on the patient's participation based on treatment- and health-related decisions.\r"

While there are many rationales given for testing, only two are deemed acceptable in chemical dependence treatment programs: to permit medical personnel to institute therapy promptly; and to assist in behavior modification (risk reduction). Early intervention is deemed premature because federal regulations disallow the use of drugs, such as AZT, until T-4 cell counts are lower than 200. In addition, many clients may not stay in treatment long enough to institute therapy and ongoing treatment. Many experimental drug trials exclude drug addicts and women. Chemically dependent individuals have neither the knowledge nor the funds to obtain experimental drugs from other countries. Moreover, current protocols of HIV test-related counseling are insufficient to assist clients in changing their high-risk behaviors. Many chemically dependent clients who receive a positive test result relapse to drug abuse or act out sexually; many who receive a negative test result deny the need to change behaviors to avoid infection. Additionally, test result validity and discrimination are presented as deterrents to testing. In long-term treatment situations, where HIV/AIDS education and counseling are done over time as part of treatment and where support systems are in place, HIV testing can be an aid in behavior change.\r"

Data are presented describing the characteristics of a successful methadone program that supports long-term treatment and adequate individual dosing. The disparity between the data and general attitudes toward methadone treatment is discussed. The variable quality among methadone treatment programs is also addressed, urging improved quality of care throughout the modality. It is suggested that quality of life issues are perhaps more important than the drug-free state. Some observations on recovery-oriented methadone treatment are made. A definition of abstinence that provides for appropriate use of licit psychoactive drugs is proposed.\r"

This article reviews significant problems and coping strategies, drawing on experience in a drug abuse treatment program where a third of the patients are HIV infected. Patient-related problems include denial, anger, depression, and isolation. The coping strategies that patients use can exacerbate their illness. Effective coping strategies may involve the development of mutual-support groups and public education. Staff-related problems include the fear of infection, protecting confidentiality, the need to develop new treatment goals, and recognizing the limitations of drug abuse treatment. To lessen the fears of infection, programs can exercise clear body substance precautions, conduct frequent inservice training, and hold periodic updates for staff. To adequately protect confidentiality, programs can keep up with rapidly changing laws and guidelines. To modify treatment goals, programs can alter admission standards for HIV-infected patients, change treatment methods to minimize the impact of occasional relapses, develop medical referral networks, and give special consideration to counselors who treat HIV-infected patients. To cope with the limitations of drug abuse treatment, programs can support counseling staff in coping with emotionally stressful clinical problems and to avoid burnout.\r"

  ".W": "Antisera to peptides that represent regions within the fourth and fifth conserved domains of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 were tested for recognition of the gp120 glycoprotein and for the ability to interfere with gp120 binding to the CD4 receptor molecule. Antisera to both peptides contained equivalent antibody titers, showed equivalent reactions with denatured gp120 on Western blot, and had group-specific reactivity. Preincubation of gp120 with either anti-peptide sera prebound to a solid phase substantially blocked soluble CD4 binding to gp120. Similarly, preincubation of gp120 with CD4-positive cells substantially diminished recognition of gp120 by both anti-peptide antisera. These results provide serologic evidence that regions near or within the fourth and fifth conserved domains of gp120 are involved in CD4 binding. However, neither anti-peptide sera could block soluble gp120 from binding to CD4-positive cells nor inhibited HIV-1 envelope-mediated syncytium formation or virus infection. These results demonstrate that antisera to regions proximal to the CD4 binding site of gp120 may compete poorly with CD4 for gp120 binding.\r"

A significant decrease in duodenal CD4 cells (p less than 0.001) and CD4/CD8 ratio (p less than 0.001) follows HIV-1 infection when compared to HIV-1-negative controls, more accentuated both in patients of stage WR6 and suffering from diarrhea than in those of stages WR1-5 or without diarrhea. In addition, a significant increase in CD8 cells (p less than 0.01) could be found in HIV-1-infected patients, again with lower levels in patients of stages WR6 than WR1-5. A strong correlation was found between the intestinal and peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio (R = 0.80), but the correlation was weak if HIV-1-negative persons were excluded from analysis (R = 0.29). Treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins improved diarrhea in four of five patients; two patients gained weight. Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria, villous atrophy, CD4- and CD8-cell percentage, and CD4/CD8 ratio were not influenced.\r"

A case-control study involving personal interviews with 26 NIR cases and 74 controls was conducted to determine if lifestyle information that might jeopardize a soldier's military career could be obtained from an Army population and to evaluate risk factors for prevalent HIV infection. Subjects consented to a voluntary, anonymous, and confidential interview containing information on demographic characteristics, medical history, drug use, and sexual behavior. Of 26 cases interviewed, 20 (76.9%) reported behaviors defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as risk factors for HIV infection, while 11 of 74 (14.9%) controls also reported such behaviors. This proportion of reclassified NIR cases was similar to that reported from the NIR case series study conducted by the CDC. Of the six (23.1%) cases who remained at NIR, all reported at least one of the following risks: a history of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual contact with prostitutes, or sexual activity with female partners which caused bleeding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In our setting, the new criteria appear to affect case ascertainment in male intravenous drug abusers, with extrapulmonary tuberculosis being the disease that accounts for the major increase in the identified cases. An additional effect of this case revision has been on the median survival time of AIDS patients, which will probably increase due to the use of the new definition criteria.\r"

Anti-HIV antibodies were found in 30 (2.6%) of the general population. 55 (13.2%) blood donors, and 93 (25.5%) patients suffering from icterigenic hepatitis. HBsAg was observed in 103 (9.1%) of the general population, 45 (10.8%) blood donors, 15 (13.4%) healthy anti-HIV carriers, 59 (34.1%) AIDS patients, and 45 (40%) icterigenous hepatitis patients. The simultaneous presence of anti-HIV and HBsAg was noted in 4 (0.4%) of the general population, 8 (2%) blood donors, 15 (13.4%) healthy anti-HIV carriers, 59 (34.1%) AIDS cases, and 36 (10%) patients suffering from icterigenic hepatitis. A high prevalence of HBeAg and serological markers of infection by the delta agent were noted in the different groups. HDAg was noted only among AIDS patients or those suffering from icterigenic hepatitis, with a higher frequency among anti-HIV carriers. Our conclusion from this study is that healthy anti-HIV carriers are no more likely to be HBsAg carriers than the HIV-seronegative subjects. However, immunodeficiency induced previously by HIV infection is likely to be responsible for the high prevalence of HBsAg among AIDS patients.\r"

The mean number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization and embryo transfer rates, and clinical pregnancy rates are not significantly different between the two procedures. If bleeding occurs from the vaginal puncture site, it is easily controlled with pressure. In this study, postoperative pelvic infection occurred in three patients. The above advantages and associated reduction in cost achieved with the trans-vaginal, ultrasound-guided procedure make it the current method of choice for oocyte retrieval.\r"

In the frozen sections immunostained for ERs and PRs, no specific nuclear staining was detected in any of the six tumors. Since the immunocytochemical method provides a more tissue-specific evaluation of hormone receptors, the low level of ERs detected in one tumor using the biochemical assay is attributed to nonspecific binding. It appears that endodermal sinus tumor expresses neither ERs nor PRs.\r"

After a fetal heart rate tracing and scalp blood gas level were obtained near maximum maternal fever, a 650-mg acetaminophen suppository was administered. If the temperature remained greater than 101 degrees F, the dose was repeated in one to two hours. The fetal heart rate tracing was analyzed again after the mother's fever was reduced by acetaminophen. All patients delivered within four hours of the first dose. Umbilical artery blood gases were obtained at delivery. Significant improvements in the bicarbonate concentration and base deficit were noted at the time of delivery as compared to the scalp gas at the height of the maternal fever. The fetal heart rate tracings at the height of the maternal fever, characterized by tachycardia, poor variability and late decelerations, changed to a normal heart rate pattern without decelerations when the mother's fever was reduced. Hence, in the laboring gravida with chorioamnionitis, reducing maternal fever with acetaminophen improves fetal status and thereby may reduce the probability of cesarean section for fetal distress.\r"

The other two (VI-1 and VI-16) left the penetration rates virtually unchanged. The extent of the penetration rate reduction depended on the concentrations of antibodies A-24, B-20, III-3 and VII-5; if undiluted, they produced a significant reduction in the penetration rates; the largest average reduction was almost 50% with undiluted antibody A-24. Decreasing concentrations of the monoclonal antisperm antibodies resulted in significantly smaller reductions in the sperm penetration rates. The reason for the reduced penetration rates observed might have been a blockage of receptors on the sperm surface by the antibodies. That can inhibit enzyme reactions of the spermatozoa or interfere with the interaction between oocyte and spermatozoon membranes. Only antibody III-3 caused agglutination of human spermatozoa in the micro sperm agglutination and immobilization tests. Therefore, the agglutination or immobilization of spermatozoa might not be responsible for the reduced penetration rates after the addition of monoclonal antibodies, in contrast to findings with polyclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "A study was designed to compare two methods of predicting the time of ovulation by detection of the urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge with two immunoassay kits designed for home use. A newly developed kit, TestPack, was compared with an existing kit, Ovustick. A group of 20 women with regular cycles were studied for one menstrual cycle. Ovulation was established with a serum LH surge and disappearance of the dominant follicle using transvaginal sonography followed by a rise in the serum progesterone level. In the 20 subjects, presumptive evidence of ovulation was obtained by determining the LH surge and the subsequent progesterone peak. In 18 of the 20, disappearance of the dominant follicle was also documented. Ovulation was predicted in 17 of the 20 subjects by both TestPack and Ovustick. Both tests were effective in predicting the day of ovulation, but TestPack provided a more easily defined end point and required less time and effort to perform.\r"

Two hundred fifty-eight infertile women had CA drawn at the initial visit of an infertility workup. Of them, 46.3% were CA positive (CA+). One hundred forty-five patients underwent laparoscopy (LPY). Tubal factor was diagnosed in 87.2% of CA+ patients and 13.6% of CA negative (CA-) ones (P less than .001), with a rising frequency by CA positivity. CA correctly predicted the presence or absence of tubal factor in 86.9% of patients. The frequency of abnormal hysterosalpingograms (HSG) was higher in CA+ patients. The predictive values for tubal factor with low, mid and high CA+ were 62.5%, 97.5% and 95.8%, respectively, and for no tubal factor with CA- was 72.3%. Combining HSG with CA- increased that value. Agreement between the LPY and HSG findings by the CA result showed a high correlation. A history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or intrauterine device use was more common in CA+ patients, but only 25.3% of patients with tubal factor had a history of PID. The frequency of positive cervical chlamydial cultures was 0.8%. CA determined with ELISA appears to be an accurate screening test for tubal factor infertility and can be used to reliably select the procedure of choice for tubal evaluation.\r"

The FHR cycles were significantly shorter in the second stage of labor as compared to the latent and active phases. Cycles of markedly diminished variability (less than or equal to 2.5 beats per minute) were observed in 16% of the fetuses during the latent phase and had a mean duration of 42 minutes, in 21% of the fetuses during the active phase with a mean duration of 68.3 minutes and in 8% of the fetuses during the second stage with a mean duration of 28.5 minutes. Knowledge of the normal length and frequency of FHR cycles is imperative for the correct interpretation of intrapartum FHR patterns in preterm fetuses.\r"

The peak month for the birth of monozygotic twins was September in both populations, while the maximum number of deliveries occurred in January for the Bedouins and August for the Jews. Of Jewish dizygotic twin births, higher rates were found from July to December. In addition, the peak months of singleton births in women aged 35 years and older and in women of high parity did not coincide with the peak months of multiple births. Maternal age and parity have been shown to greatly influence twin birth rates. The autumnal peak we found, which was independent of ethnic origin and its associated cultural and sociologic differences, was also independent of maternal age and parity and was consistent with findings in other populations in the northern hemisphere. That finding suggests that a seasonal factor, as yet undefined, affects the rates of multiple births.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue hypoxia in regions of solid tumors has been identified as a factor that may affect the behavior of cancer cells. In this study, cells were isolated from hypoxic regions of transplanted murine tumors and tested for sensitivity to anticancer drugs and ability to form experimental metastases. The tumors studied were KHT-C2-LP1 fibrosarcoma and SC-CVII squamous cell carcinoma in C3H mice and B16F10-A1 melanoma in C57BL mice. Our results indicate that the position of tumor cells relative to the vasculature, which determines the degree of tissue oxygenation, does not influence the in vitro sensitivity of cells to either doxorubicin or methotrexate. Conversely, 1-2 days after reoxygenation by introduction into culture, subpopulations of tumor cells demonstrated a transient increase in lung colonization ability. The most hypoxic cells exhibited a metastatic efficiency that was generally twice that of cells from well-oxygenated regions. This behavior is similar to behavior we observed in a previous study when tumor cells were exposed in vitro to conditions of extreme hypoxia. The findings in that study suggested that gene amplification associated with DNA over-replication is responsible for the enhanced metastatic potential, but we found no indication in the present study that gene amplification was involved in the effect observed with the hypoxic tumor subpopulations. These results provide additional evidence that reoxygenated cancer cells have a high colonization ability and that these cells may be important in the formation of distant metastases.\r"

As a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, CEA may be involved with intercellular recognition and binding and facilitate attachment of CRC to sites of metastasis. In an experimental metastasis model of CRC in athymic nude mice, a systemic injection of CEA enhanced experimental liver metastasis and implantation in liver by a weakly metastatic CRC. This CRC also selectively bound to CEA that was attached to plastic. Thus, CEA may function as an attachment factor for CRC.\r"

  ".W": "To test if circadian timing of a drug is important for its toxicity and antitumor activity, we compared the circadian patterns observed with seven equal doses of floxuridine (FUDR) infused either at a variable rate or at a constant rate in female F344 rats. For the variable-rate infusion, the daily dose of FUDR was divided into four 6-hour portions of 68%, 15%, 2%, and 15% to achieve a quasisinusoidal pattern. Peak drug delivery occurred during one of six different times of day. At a dose level resulting in 50% overall mortality, lethal toxicity differed significantly, depending on the circadian stage of maximum drug delivery. Depending on the circadian stage of maximum drug flow, variable-rate infusions were more toxic than or as toxic as constant-rate infusion. FUDR lethality was lowest when constant-rate infusion was used or when variable-rate infusion peaked during the late activity-early rest span of the recipients. The circadian pattern of variable-rate infusion also determined the antitumor activity in tumor-bearing rats. At a therapeutic dose level and at identical dose intensity, the variable-rate-infusion pattern, with peak drug flow during the late activity-early rest span, resulted in significantly greater delay in tumor growth than was observed with either the constant-rate infusion or other variable-rate patterns. We conclude that the toxicity and antitumor activity of FUDR depend on the circadian timing of the infusion peak when the drug is given by variable-rate infusion. Since some of the circadian-shaped infusions studied are toxicologically and therapeutically inferior to constant-rate infusion, the circadian pattern and not the quasi-intermittency of circadian FUDR administration is primarily responsible for these pharmacodynamic differences.\r"

Three lines of giant transgenic mice expressing a mouse metallothionein-ovine growth hormone fusion gene were generated. The giant mice weighed twice as much as control littermates. The three lines of giant mice expressing very high levels of growth hormone were bred over several generations. Mice from all three lines developed hepatocellular tumors, including adenoma and carcinoma. The occurrence of tumors was age-dependent, and their incidence increased to 70% of the mice studied after 43 weeks of age. Pathologic changes in the livers resembled those observed in rats in which hepatocellular carcinomas are induced chemically. Transgenic mice carrying the metallothionein-ovine growth hormone fusion gene represent a new model for hepatocellular carcinogenesis. This model exemplifies the oncogenic potential for a sustained proliferative growth stimulus within an organ.\r"

The P/DACT cell line, which shows the characteristics of a transport-mediated multidrug-resistant cell line, was cross-resistant to vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and a number of acridine-substituted amsacrine derivatives, but was sensitive in vitro and in vivo to amsacrine and its analog CI-921. The P/DOX cell line was cross-resistant to amsacrine but showed a similar pattern of cross-resistance to that of P/DACT in its in vitro response to amsacrine derivatives. In contrast, the P/AMSA line was substantially cross-resistant (from 27- to 146-fold) to all acridine-substituted amsacrine derivatives. However, when the substituents on the anilino side chain of amsacrine were changed, the in vitro cross-resistance of the P/AMSA line could be substantially reduced and even overcome. Derivatives with low cross-resistance ratios were tested in vivo against the P/AMSA leukemia and, in contrast to amsacrine and CI-921, were found to be active. Since the target enzyme for amsacrine action, topoisomerase II, is thought to be structurally modified in the P/AMSA line as well as in some other multidrug-resistant lines, these results suggest the feasibility of tailoring topoisomerase II-directed drugs specifically for the altered enzymes in resistant cells. New drug design approaches are therefore available for overcoming two major types of multidrug resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Bone metastases reproducibly developed in nude rats after an injection of LOX human malignant melanoma cells into the left ventricle, with hind leg paralyses appearing in all animals within approximately 2 weeks. Manifest metastases were present exclusively in the skeletal system, predominantly in the lumbar portion of the spine, the long bones, and occasionally in the skull. Intracardially injected 125I-labeled tumor cells and monodisperse microspheres were distributed in parallel to the various tissues. Moreover, because the levels of radioactivity were significantly lower in bone than in lung, kidney, and liver, the pattern of metastases could not be explained solely by hemodynamic factors. In chemotherapy experiments, the survival time of rats given left ventricular injections of LOX cells increased in a dose-dependent manner after the animals were treated with dacarbazine. Researchers may find the model useful for studying the biology of bone metastases and for testing the sensitivity of these lesions to drugs.\r"

  ".W": "To determine mechanisms of endocrine dysfunction in patients with testicular cancer, we performed static and dynamic testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and testicular exocrine function in 13 patients and 11 normal control subjects, as well as in vitro studies of tumor tissue and remaining adjacent \"normal\" testicular tissue in the 13 patients. In tumor tissue, we demonstrated (a) elevated concentrations of total serum estradiol and serum estradiol not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, (b) impaired spermatogenesis and sperm motility, and (c) blocking of multiple enzymes necessary for steroidogenesis. The data were consistent with a paracrine-endocrine mechanism in which tumor-produced human chorionic gonadotropin stimulates production of estradiol by \"normal\" testicular tissue but not tumor tissue, and the high estradiol levels then result in impaired spermatogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90156410\r", 
  ".W": "Flow cytometry has been used to measure doxorubicin (DOX) retention in several pairs of drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines and in unselected human tumor cell lines. Co-exposure to several agents that have been reported to reverse multidrug resistance, particularly calcium entry blockers (CEBs), produced a dose-dependent increase in DOX accumulation in MDR cell lines. In MDR Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHRC5), DOX levels declined rapidly following removal of CEBs, reaching a plateau value above that found in cells treated with DOX alone; this small increase probably represents DOX that is not accessible to the p170 efflux pump overexpressed in these cells. Increased DOX retention could be observed even after brief exposure to CEBs and washout and correlates with a decrease in cell proliferation over a 3-day growth assay. These results suggest that only a brief inhibition of drug efflux is sufficient to produce a meaningful reversal of drug resistance.\r"
