These conflicts are elaborated and pragmatic ways of relieving this situation are suggested.\r"

The model locates the three components of the disease--the acute panic attack, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance--in three specific sites of the CNS: the brainstem, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex, respectively. The authors suggest experiments to test their model.\r"

Using the clinician-administered DIB as the diagnostic standard, the authors found that the DIS borderline index had a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 86.2%, and a kappa of 0.67. The DIS borderline index is a promising extension of the DIS that will facilitate studies of borderline personality disorder in clinical and community settings.\r"

  ".W": "An endotracheal tube with a 5 mm diameter ultrasonic transducer incorporated into its distal end was inserted into the tracheas of six anesthetized dogs. The device provides for ultrasound measurement of aortic diameter and blood velocity in the ascending aorta to obtain cardiac outputs. Because measurements are made proximal to the origins of the aortic arch vessels, total cardiac output is obtained. Procedures for measurement of aortic diameter, aortic blood velocity, and cardiac output are discussed. The resulting data were used to empirically determine the angle of incidence of the ultrasound beam that gave the best least squares fit over a range of thermodilution cardiac outputs. For an angle of incidence of 62.3 degrees, the relationship between cardiac output determined by thermal dilution and by transtracheal Doppler was transtracheal Doppler cardiac output = -.69 + 1.19 thermal dilution cardiac output. R2 = .82. The results from this preliminary assessment of the feasibility of measuring cardiac output in dogs using transtracheal Doppler suggest that additional studies should be pursued. Additional issues that require investigation include confirmation of constancy of human anatomy and demonstration of lack of tracheal trauma from the Doppler equipped endotracheal tube.\r"

The mediators, however, did not elevate and tissue neutrophil counts did not correlate with increased airway hyperresponsiveness. Intratracheal injection of heat-killed Bordetella bronchiseptica produced no alteration in these parameters. Thus, it is speculated that airway epithelial damage and effects on ciliostatic function induced by the organism are primarily involved in the pathogenesis.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences between naloxone and placebo administration in any index of ventilatory response to CO2 or resistive loading. When an inspiratory resistive load was added during CO2 rebreathing, minute ventilation at PETCO2 = 50 mm Hg in all 11 patients decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) with placebo and naloxone. In response to the inspiratory resistive load, in eight of the 11 patients mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) did not increase; these eight subjects were classified as noncompensators. Naloxone did not affect the P0.1 response to inspiratory resistive loading, either in the group as a whole or in the subgroup of eight patients classified as noncompensators.

  ".W": "Terbutaline, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to cause hypokalemia and an increase of plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations. We considered that terbutaline-induced hypokalemia may be due to the insulin-induced shift of potassium (K+) from the extracellular to the intracellular space. If so, then inhibition of insulin secretion by somatostatin would prevent terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Further, we wondered whether oral potassium pretreatment could prevent terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. Therefore, 10 healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women; mean age, 23 yr +/- 3 SD) received either sodium chloride (NaCl) or somatostatin intravenously together with 0.25 mg terbutaline subcutaneously in a double-blind crossover design. On a third test day, they received 39 mval of K+ powder orally before terbutaline injection in an open trial. Terbutaline caused a significant decrease of K+ (from 3.96 +/- 0.08 to 3.3 +/- 0.13 mmol/L +/- SEM; p less than 0.0005), accompanied by a significant increase in plasma glucose (from 83 +/- 3.6 to 101 +/- 4.4 mg/dl +/- SEM; p less than 0.01) and serum insulin concentrations (from 11.7 +/- 0.9 to 19.9 +/- 1.1 microU/ml +/- SEM; p less than 0.001), confirming earlier data. Somatostatin pretreatment inhibited the terbutaline-induced hypokalemia; the small fall of K+ (from 3.7 +/- 0.08 to 3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) was no longer significant. Insulin secretion was completely blocked by somatostatin, leading to an even more pronounced increase of blood glucose. Hypokalemia after terbutaline injection was not prevented by oral potassium pretreatment. In summary, the present findings confirm that terbutaline-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased plasma glucose and insulin levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The development of the pleural inflammatory response to asbestos remains poorly defined. Importantly, the role of the pleural mesothelial cell in recruitment of neutrophils to the pleural space is not known. We hypothesized that rabbit pleural mesothelial cells stimulated by asbestos fibers release chemotactic factor(s) for neutrophils. Primary cultures of rabbit pleural mesothelial cells were established, and their purity verified by the presence of keratin and hyaluronic acid mucin. Mesothelial cells in serum-free media, in the presence of 30 micrograms/ml of crocidolite asbestos, released chemotaxins for neutrophils. This activity was not dependent on the type of asbestos fiber or fiber length. It was dose-dependent until 30 micrograms/ml of asbestos. The chemotactic fractions had the ability to increase both directed and random migration of neutrophils. The chemotactic activity was not present in sonicated fractions of unstimulated mesothelial cells, nor in supernates of asbestos fibers alone. Characterization of the chemotactic activity showed that it was heat stable (56 degrees C per 30 min) and sensitive to digestion with trypsin and papain. On Sephadex G-50 chromatography, it had a molecular weight between 6,000 and 9,000. Production of the chemotactic activity was inhibitable by cycloheximide. These results demonstrate that pleural mesothelial cells can actively synthesize a protein fraction with chemotactic activity for neutrophils. Production of this mesothelial cell-derived chemotactic activity for neutrophils may play an important role in the initiation of the inflammatory response of the pleura to asbestos.\r"

  ".W": "Reproducibility of methacholine inhalation tests (MIT) over a 2-wk period has been established in adult populations, but similar studies demonstrating reproducibility in children are lacking. We set out to establish the reproducibility of MIT in children as a prerequisite for a study of the natural history of airway hyperreactivity in asthmatic children. Most inhalation testing is done in persons with mild asthma because the recommended time interval for the withholding of medications prior to bronchial challenge is poorly tolerated by more labile asthmatics. In order to evaluate asthmatics with more severe disease, we modified a standardized method of methacholine inhalation to include a three-tier pretest medication regimen and investigated the reproducibility of this MIT protocol in 11 children as young as 6 yr of age. The three tiers were designed to keep baseline FEV1 greater than or equal to 70% predicted since diminished baseline airway caliber may affect MIT results. Eight of the 11 children were bronchodilator-dependent, and two of the eight also required inhaled steroids. Eleven children (6 to 13 yr of age) underwent MIT, between December and March, 1 day, 1 wk, and 1 month after an initial test. The PD20FEV1 using cumulative breath units (BU) were compared. The range of PD20FEV1 in the 11 children was 0.27 to 14.4 BU, with nine subjects classified as severe (PD20FEV1 less than 2.5 BU). We found a high degree of reproducibility of MIT. The interest correlation coefficient (r) was 0.98 after 1 day, 0.95 after 1 wk, and 0.96 after 1 month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present studies, we determined whether an established infection due to C. neoformans could be treated with Cs-A. Mice inoculated IT develop a prominent pulmonary infection with late dissemination to distant organs. The survival of mice infected by the pulmonary route that received Cs-A subcutaneously was prolonged in both immunologically intact and congenitally T-cell-deficient mice (athymic nude mice). In normal mice that received Cs-A, growth of C. neoformans was arrested in the lung, spleen, kidney, and liver, and the rapid rate of accumulation of organisms in the brain was slowed as compared to that of control mice. In nude mice, the organisms continued to increase in all organs although at a considerably slower rate than in untreated control nude mice. Mice given C. neoformans IV developed infection in the brain at the time of inoculation. When an inoculum was deposited in the brains of normal mice by giving the organism IV and Cs-A treatment initiated 3 days later, mice receiving Cs-A did not demonstrate a reduced number of C. neoformans in the brain as compared to untreated control mice. Thus, Cs-A was effective for treatment of extraneural cryptococcal infection in normal mice, but it was unable to reduce cryptococcal replication in the central nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Unblinded, dose-escalation 8-week trial. SETTING: An AIDS outpatient clinic of a university-affiliated municipal hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-four patients with stage III or IV HIV infection were enrolled. Five patients in six different dosage cohorts completed the study. The population was predominantly homosexual men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (stage III). INTERVENTIONS: Oral dextran sulfate was given three times daily in total daily doses of 900 to 5400 mg for 8 weeks. Patients were monitored for tolerance and toxicity. Immunologic and virologic values were also followed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oral dextran sulfate was given without significant side effects. The commonest minor subjective complications were mental hyperexcitability and gastrointestinal complaints. The most frequent laboratory abnormalities were leukopenia and hepatic transaminase elevations. Eleven patients required dose reductions, and therapy was stopped in 4 because of toxicities. The CD4 lymphocyte numbers did not change appreciably. No decline in beta-2 microglobulin levels occurred. The HIV antigen levels were unchanged from baseline. No assay for dextran sulfate plasma levels has yet proven successful. CONCLUSIONS: Oral dextran sulfate appears to be well tolerated. No evidence of systemic absorption of the parent compound is available. However, in view of the promising in vitro effects and acceptable toxicity, oral dextran sulfate as a potential antiretroviral agent continues to be studied.\r"

For the asymptomatic, nonpregnant adult of any age, no evidence supports the need for a complete physical examination as traditionally defined. The efficacy for three screening procedures has been established: Blood pressure should be measured at least every 2 years; women more than 40 years of age should have a breast examination done by a physician annually; and sexually active women should have a pelvic examination and a Papanicolaou test at least every 3 years after two initial negative tests have been obtained 1 year apart. Because of the prevalence and morbidity of specific diseases, and the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests, several other maneuvers are recommended for screening asymptomatic adults, although the optimal frequency has not been determined experimentally. Weight should be measured every 4 years. Visual acuity should be tested annually in adults older than 60 years of age. To identify patients at high risk for melanoma, a complete skin examination should be done once. Hearing should be tested by audioscope annually in adults older than 60 years of age. Physicians should encourage patients to have annual dental visits. To identify valvular abnormalities requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, cardiac auscultation should be done at least twice in an adult. Men older than 60 years of age should have a yearly examination of the abdomen for the presence of aortic aneurysm. Although the other components of the complete physical examination may be important in establishing and maintaining the physician-patient relationship, they have not been shown to be effective screening maneuvers for asymptomatic disease.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Case reports were identified through a computer search using MEDLIN (1976 to 1987), and from bibliographies in review articles (up to 1978). STUDY SELECTION: Twelve reports published since 1978 were found. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from 20 recently reported cases and 5 cases from personal records were compared with data from 142 previously reported, autopsy-proven cases summarized in a 1978 review article. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Thromboembolic disease, coagulopathy, and the postoperative state were the three major risk factors. Except for abdominal pain and remittent fever, clinical features were not helpful in diagnosis. A fall in hemoglobin, and progressive biochemical hypoadrenalism were important clues. Diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography and an absent cortisol response to intravenous corticotropin. Long-term follow-up showed complete atrophy and functional failure of the adrenal gland. CONCLUSIONS: Death from bilateral massive adrenal hemorrhage can be prevented by pre-emptive steroid therapy in high-risk patients who have certain clinical and laboratory features.\r"

An early insertion of the device will avoid deterioration of the heart and other organs to an irreversible condition. Cardiac assistance for a minimum of 24 hours is recommended with a mild dose of anticoagulant. It is necessary to monitor the hemodynamic functions during circulatory support and weaning. Most of the mechanical devices are quite reliable, and complications during ventricular assist are easily managed. The patient should be in the same condition as in ordinary elective transplant candidate before transplantation. Patients with an artificial heart or ventricular assist device should not be on the priority emergency list for cardiac transplantation. Patients suffering from cardiogenic shock can be stabilized with a ventricular assist device to allow the heart to recover or be provided with other treatment. A circulatory support device can also be used as a bridge for patients awaiting a cardiac transplant.\r"

  ".W": "Since January 1985, the Heart Transplant Program at Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, has performed 89 heart transplantations in 86 patients. Twenty patients (23%) have required preoperative mechanical support of circulation or respiration prior to transplantation. The Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump (Bio-Pump) formed the basis of our circulatory support system during the period of this report. Nine patients were placed on the Bio-Pump with the intention of bridging them to transplantation. Six patients required left ventricular assistance; in 2, the device was inserted because they could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Two patients required biventricular assistance, 1 because she could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass at the end of a cardiac operation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary in 1 patient for right ventricular decompensation and cardiac arrest four hours after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. One of these 9 patients died on circulatory support, and in another, a complication developed that precluded transplantation. The remaining 7 patients (78%) underwent a successful transplant procedure after an average of 1.6 days of circulatory support (range, 0.5 to three days), and all are long-term survivors of transplantation. There has been 1 late death at 17 months from a cerebrovascular hemorrhage. In summary, the centrifugal pump provides excellent short-term circulatory support for individuals who would otherwise die before cardiac transplantation.\r"

Under development for permanent circulatory support in patients with end-stage heart disease, the LVAS, in this application, derives power and control from an external console via a percutaneous lead. The LVAS was implanted in 20 patients (16 men, 4 women) who were hemodynamically unstable or in refractory cardiogenic shock. The mean age was 44.9 years (range, 25 to 63 years). Preoperative diagnosis was evenly divided between end-stage ischemic disease, cardiomyopathy, and acute myocardial infarction. Implanted in the left upper quadrant within the anterior abdominal wall, the blood pump was connected between the left ventricular apex and ascending aorta. Total support of the systemic circulation and substantial left ventricular unloading were achieved with synchronous counterpulsation for periods up to 90 days (mean, 22.7 days). All patients were stabilized hemodynamically. The mean preoperative cardiac index of 1.5 L/min/m2 increased by a factor of 2. Pulmonary arterial pressures decreased substantially. Serious complications occurred in 16 patients, precluding cardiac transplantation in 10. Most complications (greater than 70%) were in patients who did not receive transplants; the most common complication was bleeding. Twelve of 13 patients with LVAS implants for more than seven days were mobilized, and 4 were fully ambulatory and completely rehabilitated. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in 10 patients after implants ranging from two to 90 days (mean, 30.3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three other patients became candidates because of failed transplantation. The 100-mL Jarvik-7 device was used in the first 3 patients; all subsequent recipients were treated with the 70-mL Jarvik-7. Postoperative anticoagulation was designed to keep the partial thromboplastin time between 2 and 2.5 times control. The control values were obtained during administration of heparin and dipyridamole. In all cases the function of the total artificial heart was adequate to support the needs of the recipient, and there were no mechanical difficulties with the device or the drive system. The average time of implantation was 9 days (range, one to 35 days). Two patients died before transplantation, 1 with sepsis from fungus and the other with hemorrhage from a torn pulmonary arterial anastomosis. Fourteen patients received cardiac allografts, and 7 continue to survive without restrictions.

  ".W": "Erythromelalgia (erythermalgia) is characterized by attacks of severe burning pain, erythema, and warmth of the extremities, primarily the feet and, to a lesser extent, the hands. The distress is provoked by environmental heat, exercise, and dependency; it is relieved by exposure to cold and elevation of the extremity. Primary and secondary forms of erythromelalgia exist. Secondary erythromelalgia has been linked to a wide variety of diseases, the most common of which are certain myeloproliferative disorders: polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. We describe, for the first time, a patient in whom chronic myelogenous leukemia was associated with the development of erythromelalgia, review the 60 cases in the world literature of erythromelalgia in patients with myeloproliferative syndromes, and compare the primary and secondary forms of the disease. Importantly, symptoms of erythromelalgia preceded the onset of a myeloproliferative disease by a median of 2 1/2 years. Therefore, all patients with erythromelalgia should be monitored with periodic blood cell counts. An abnormal hemoglobin level, white blood cell or platelet count, or immature cells in the differential count are not seen in idiopathic erythromelalgia and should alert the physician to the possibility of a more serious underlying disease process. Treatment of the myeloproliferative syndrome will sometimes alleviate the symptoms of erythromelalgia. Alternatively, a single daily dose of aspirin results in dramatic improvement in most patients with either primary or secondary erythromelalgia.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blockers, a newer class of antihypertensive medications, have gained considerable acceptance as monotherapeutic agents, particularly in low renin hypertension where diuretics are also most effective. To study whether thiazide diuretics exert an additional antihypertensive effect in the setting of calcium channel blockade, we gave verapamil hydrochloride (360 mg/d) or hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) alone and in combination in an open study to 13 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure (170 +/- 17/109 +/- 6 mm Hg pretreatment to 150 +/- 25/95 +/- 8 mm Hg with verapamil; 170 +/- 5/109 +/- 2 mm Hg pretreatment to 164 +/- 25/103 +/- 10 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide), but addition of hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil resulted in no added benefit (150 +/- 25/95 +/- 8 mm Hg vs 150 +/- 20/95 +/- 6 mm Hg). Furthermore, while hydrochlorothiazide lowered serum potassium values (4.2 +/- 0.25 mmol/L to 3.7 +/- 0.35 mmol/L) and stimulated plasma renin activity (1.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL/h) pretreatment to 3.3 +/- 2.7 ng/mL/h with verapamil), verapamil only modestly elevated renin activity (1.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL/h pretreatment to 2.7 +/- 2.5 ng/mL/h with verapamil) and did not lower potassium values. Altogether, the data suggest that in essential hypertension, at least for verapamil, concurrent diuretic therapy may not be helpful or warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen-independent binding of T lymphocytes to a variety of cell types has been shown to be mediated by receptor-ligand pairs of adhesion molecules. In forms of inflammatory synovitis (including rheumatoid arthritis), T cells home to synovium, become activated, and participate in the generation of chronic synovitis. Using indirect immunofluorescence assays on synovial frozen tissue sections and on synovial fibroblast cell lines, we studied the distribution of cell adhesion molecules on components of the synovial microenvironment in inflammatory synovitis. We reasoned that analysis of the cell types within synovium that express adhesion molecules might provide clues to lymphocyte-stromal interactions that occur in inflammatory synovitis. We found that antibodies against the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3) molecule and the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) both reacted with macrophage-like type A synovial cells and synovial fibroblasts, as well as with tissue macrophages and vessel endothelium. Using flow cytometry, we found that anti-LFA-3 and anti-ICAM-1 (but not antibodies against their ligands CD2 and LFA-1) reacted with synovial fibroblast cells cultured in vitro. Thus, these data demonstrate that the ligands for lymphocyte LFA-1 molecules (ICAM-1) and for T cell CD2 molecules (LFA-3) are widely distributed among cell types of the synovial microenvironment and provide numerous cell types with which lymphocytes can interact via these 2 adhesion pathways during the course of inflammatory synovitis.\r"

MCA levels were measured with the EIA method in the cytosol of both breast cancer and normal breast tissue as well as in the blood of 147 patients with primary breast cancer and 92 healthy subjects. MCA cytosol levels were significantly higher in carcinoma than in normal breast tissue cytosol samples. Higher MCA levels were found in the cytosol of tumor without lymph nodal involvement. The 95th percentile of the MCA value distribution in the healthy control group (11.0 U/ml) was chosen as negative/positive cut-off level. The overall positivity rate in breast cancer group was 26.5% with MCA showing a trend toward higher levels in patients with more advanced disease. Significantly higher levels were found in patients with a higher number of positive lymph nodes.\r"

Intermediate filament typing confirmed the tumor type in 262 cases and changed an erroneous cytologic diagnosis of major tumor type in nine cases. In a second group of 132 difficult cases, where the tumor type could not be revealed with certainty, IF typing confirmed the cytologic suggestion of tumor type in 50 cases, changed it in nine cases, and helped resolve ambiguities in cytologic diagnosis in 59 cases. It did not help in 14 cases. Thus IF typing adds independent objective differentiation specific information to descriptive tumor typing currently used in aspiration cytologic study. When combined with the morphologic analysis of tumor cells and clinical information it can refine the cytologic diagnosis of major tumor types and prevent error.\r"

This study included 182 patients with GM (confirmed in most by bone marrow histologic study), comprising 52 cases of our own and 130 reported in the literature. Hepatomegaly was found in 131 (72%) of the 182 patients, cirrhosis in seven (4%), and periportal fibrosis in 25 (14%). Mast cell (MC) infiltration of the liver was confirmed histologically in 77 (42%). Liver specimens were available for further histologic investigation in 11 of our own cases of GM. Nine of these contained MC aggregates. Mast cells were found predominantly in the portal tracts but numerous MC also were loosely scattered throughout the sinusoids. Diagnostic confusion of GM with reactive lesions of the liver is unlikely to occur since MC, according to our own observations and the available literature, are found only in very low numbers in normal liver tissue, where they occur mainly in the portal tracts. Reliable identification of MC does, however, require special stains, like Giemsa, toluidine blue, or naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase.\r"

As the high serum AFP level in RCC without metastasis to the liver is a rare condition, histopathologic studies were performed on surgical specimens. Histologically, the tumor was clear cell adenocarcinoma and AFP was detected in tumor cells immunohistochemically. A Concanavalin A (Con A) sepharose affinity chromatogram was performed to detect the component of AFP in this case.

However, the results are conflicting and vary between 4% and 72% of malignant melanomas with associated nevocytic nevi with a maximum frequency between 20% and 30%. These different values could be partially explained by the fact that tumors in more advanced stages might have \"overgrown\" preexisting nevocytic cells. For this reason, only cases of early stage malignant melanoma (tumor thickness less than or equal to 1.5 mm; level of invasion less than or equal to III) were included in this study (n = 150). Thirty-three (22%) of 150 cases of malignant melanoma were associated with nevocytic nevi. In an additional 6.1% of the cases there was a possible but doubtful association. In 45.4% of the cases the nevus cells could be detected below the tumor, in 18.2% they could be seen at the laterally adjacent sides, and in 36.4% they were found at both sites. Fifty percent showed junctional activity from the nevocytic nevi located to the side of the melanoma. We conclude that the finding of approximately 27% of nevocytic nevi with junctional activity among the nevocytic nevi associated with malignant melanoma could be an indicator that at least some malignant melanomas develop within or next to a preexisting and still proliferating nevocytic nevus.\r"

These enzymes may be associated with toxic reactions of differing frequency and severity. Specifically, the complication of enzyme-induced hyperglycemia may be seen more frequently after exposure to the E. coli product. The authors present two patients in whom it was necessary to substitute the Erwinia enzyme for the E. coli enzyme because of the occurrence of severe allergic reactions to the E. coli enzyme. Hyperglycemia induced by the first product improved after the substitution, suggesting that the Erwinia enzyme may be less diabetogenic than the E. coli enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "In rats with large myocardial infarctions, we compared the effects of captopril, a presumed arterial and venous vasodilator, with hydralazine, which is thought primarily to be an arterial vasodilator. To determine if the effects of captopril were dependent on the pathophysiological consequences of heart failure, we also studied a group of noninfarcted rats treated with captopril. In noninfarcted rats treated with captopril, left ventricular (LV) systolic and mean aortic pressures decreased from 132 +/- 12 to 107 +/- 15 mm Hg and 122 +/- 1 to 100 +/- 2, respectively (p less than 0.01). In noninfarcted rats, captopril decreased LV weight, LV weight/body weight, and total heart weight/body weight but produced no effects on the peripheral venous circulation. Rats subjected to coronary artery ligation were selected by ECG criteria to have large myocardial infarctions and were treated for 4 weeks with captopril (n = 8), hydralazine (n = 5), or placebo (n = 9). In infarcted rats treated with captopril, LV systolic, mean aortic pressures and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) decreased (p less than 0.01) from 115 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 3 mm Hg, 106 +/- 4 to 74 +/- 3 mm Hg, and 23 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Mean circulatory filling pressure decreased (p less than 0.05) from 11.2 +/- 0.6 to 8.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg and venous compliance increased (p less than 0.05) from 2.04 +/- 0.07 to 2.70 +/- 0.20 ml/mm Hg/kg.

Faster growth was associated with proportional increases in total RNA and messenger RNA. These findings indicated that greater capacity for protein synthesis was a major factor in accelerated growth. Despite faster growth, heart content of ribosomal subunits was higher in piglets than in 60-day-old pigs or adult rats, suggesting a relatively slower rate of peptide chain initiation than elongation. When hearts from 5-day-old pigs were perfused in vitro, protein synthesis was more rapid in the LVFW than in the RVFW. In the absence of added insulin, the higher rate was due to both greater efficiency and greater capacity for protein synthesis. In the presence of the hormone, greater capacity was responsible for the increased rate of protein synthesis in the LVFW as compared with the RVFW.\r"

At physiological concentration of Ca2+ (1 mM) in the incubation medium, [Ca2+]i was below 0.5 microM and platelet aggregation was not shown. Ionomycin (0.15 microM) or collagen (50 micrograms/ml), but not ADP (10 microM), sharply enhanced the [Ca2+]i to near 1 microM and caused the aggregation. A calcium entry blocker, verapamil, completely abolished both the [Ca2+]i rise and the aggregation. NCO-700, a membrane permeable inhibitor against cysteine proteases (including CANP), dose-dependently blocked the aggregation but did not change the [Ca2+]i transient. SDS-PAGE revealed that filamin, talin, and 70 kDa protein were specifically degraded when platelets were aggregated by ionomycin or collagen and that the proteolysis was not observed when the aggregation was blocked by verapamil or NCO-700. These data provided evidence that Ca2+ entry exceeding 0.5 microM is essential, but not sufficient per se, and that activation of cysteine protease, most likely CANP, is involved in the platelet aggregation by collagen or calcium ionophore.\r"

The natural history of cervical spondylosis is associated with the aging process. Senescent and pathologic processes are thus morphologically indistinguishable. Clinical manifestations of cervical spondylosis may arise when morphologic sequelae are superimposed on a developmentally narrow spinal canal. The two clinical syndromes of spondylotic radiculopathy and myelopathy are distinct, yet they may overlap.\r"

In a graded organ culture assay, in which regression of the Mullerian duct of the 14 1/2-day rat fetus was used as a measure of bioactivity, MIS could not be detected in ovarian fragments from fetal rats. After birth, however, MIS bioactivity first became detectable at 4 days of age. Fragments from ovaries of rats 7 days of age and older contained moderate levels of MIS activity which remained detectable throughout the prepubertal period, although extreme individual variability was characteristic. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against human recombinant MIS was used to localize MIS in rat ovarian tissue. Avidin-biotin enhanced immunoperoxidase staining could not detect MIS in the 15-day fetal or 1 day postnatal ovary, where no follicular growth was noticed. In ovaries from rats 1 week or older, where follicular growth was apparent, MIS could be localized specifically and exclusively in the cytoplasm of granulosa cells. MIS was found more in the innermost layers of granulosa cells than in the peripheral layers in preantral follicles. In antral follicles, MIS was found predominantly in the cumulus oophorus cells and periantral cells. In these developing ovaries, MIS could not be found in follicles with features of atresia.\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the colocalization of ACTH-related immunoreactive forms and alpha-MSH-related immunoreactive forms in corticotropic cells of the anterior pituitary of larval Ambystoma tigrinum. Subsequent analysis of acid extracts of anterior pituitaries obtained from larval, neotene, and postmetamorphic adults indicated that the molar ratio of ACTH(1-39) to alpha-MSH was, respectively, 2.5:1, 1:1.5, and 1:1.3. However, in sexually mature adults the molar ratio of ACTH(1-39) to alpha-MSH was 8:1. These results indicate that before and immediately after metamorphosis, both ACTH(1-39) and alpha-MSH are major end products of corticotropic cells in this species. As postmetamorphic animals reach sexual maturity, ACTH(1-39) is a major end product of corticotropic cells and only trace amounts of alpha-MSH are produced. Thus in A. tigrinum the proteolytic processing of ACTH in corticotropic cells is developmentally regulated. The alpha-MSH-related peptide produced by the corticotropic cells appears to be an ACTH(1-13)amide-like form.\r"

The tibia and lumbar vertebrae weights were decreased, but the bone calcium percentage remained normal. Bone volumes in the tibial metaphysis and the first lumbar vertebra were normal on quantitative histomorphometry. Osteoclast, osteoblast, and osteoid surface percentages, however, and the calculated daily mineral apposition rate in the tibia (1.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.6 microns/day) and vertebra (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2 microns/day) were all severely decreased in diabetic rats. Plasma osteocalcin concentrations were also markedly decreased in diabetic rats (24 +/- 2 vs. 108 +/- 10 ng/ml); the half-times of [125I]osteocalcin were similar in diabetic and nondiabetic rats, indicating that decreased plasma osteocalcin was due to decreased synthesis. Plasma osteocalcin levels were more decreased than expected from their suppressed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 injections did not increase plasma osteocalcin in diabetic rats as they did in nondiabetic rats. Bone osteocalcin content was normal in diabetic rats. Photon absorptiometry of tibiae showed a similar bone mineral content in diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Biomechanical properties of diabetic rat femora were all in the normal range. Nondiabetic semistarved rats with the same body weight as diabetic rats exhibited a similar delay in bone growth as diabetic rats, but the osteoblast and osteoid surfaces were normal, and the mineral apposition rate was normal (tibia) or slightly decreased (vertebra). Plasma osteocalcin concentrations were also normal in semistarved rats. Thus, the number and/or function of osteoblasts are severely suppressed in diabetes, and this results in decreased osteoid surface, mineral apposition rate, and plasma osteocalcin levels; moreover, these changes cannot be explained by simple weight loss.\r"

Treatment of dispersed ovine pituitary cells with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 6 h at a dose of 10 nM stimulated the release of 5- to 10-fold more LH than did GnRH at the same dose. Analogs of PMA also stimulated LH release, but at levels parallel to their reported abilities to activate PKC. Treatment with GnRH plus PMA stimulated more LH release than either one alone in a strictly additive manner at all dose combinations from 10 pM to 100 nM. The PKC-activating diacylglycerol sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol also stimulated LH release that was additive with GnRH-stimulated LH release. Furthermore, retinal, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited only PMA-stimulated LH release and not GnRH-stimulated LH release. These results do not support the theory that PKC activation is a necessary part of the mechanism of GnRH-stimulated LH release. The theory that calcium mobilization is also part of the mechanism of GnRH-stimulated LH release was, however, supported by the finding that GnRH did not stimulate LH release from ovine pituitary cells incubated in calcium-free medium. This demonstrates the absolute requirement for calcium in GnRH action, as proposed by others. In addition, the calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin were able to trigger LH release by themselves as well as augment GnRH- and PMA-stimulated LH release. This further strengthens the hypothesis that calcium mobilization is important in LH secretion.\r"

IGF-I is less potent than insulin, but, based on relative binding affinities for the insulin receptor, possibly acts via its own receptor. Insulin also enhances PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells both by increasing cell number and an effect independent of cell number. Insulin may have a role in bone homeostasis.\r"

Perfusion of the pancreas with high glucose and arginine induced a significant increase in ppImRNA levels within 2 h, whereas perfusion with low glucose and arginine or high glucose alone had no significant effect during this period. The insulin release induced by perfusion of high glucose combined with arginine was 2 times greater than that induced by high glucose alone or low glucose with arginine. In conclusion, insulin gene transcription can be evoked during a short period in response to an extremely large secretory demand for insulin.\r"

This potentiating effect of the monokine is dose dependent, lasts for at least 45 min after IL-1 removal from the medium, and is not confined to glucose; IL-1 also potentiates the insulin secretory responses to tolbutamide and glyceraldehyde. IL-1 exposure of islets incubated with myo-[2-3H]inositol to label their phosphoinositides (PI) results in an increase in [3H]inositol efflux, an event that persists long after removal of IL-1 from the medium. Direct measurements of labeled inositol phosphate accumulation substantiate the concept that this sustained [3H]inositol efflux response is the direct result of a sustained increase in PI hydrolysis. These results expand the list of compounds that induce time-dependent potentiation in islets to include IL-1. This action of the monokine, mediated at least in part by PI-derived second messenger molecules, may contribute to its postulated effects on insulin and glucose homeostasis.\r"

In the present study, dexamethasone (Dex) induced the cellular concentration of p33-mRNA 10- to 15-fold. This effect was time and dose dependent. The effect of Dex could be accounted for by a 10- to 15-fold increase in p33-mRNA transcription. However, insulin administration resulted in only a 3-fold increase in the transcription of p33-mRNA. The insulin induction of transcription was time and dose dependent and was blocked by the addition of alpha-amanitin. There was no increase in the transcription of a control gene, beta-tubulin, by either insulin or Dex. Neither insulin nor Dex altered the stability of p33-mRNA. Since the cellular concentration of p33-mRNA was induced to a greater extent than was transcription, insulin must be regulating at least one other step in the sequence between RNA synthesis and RNA stability.\r"

  ".U": "89107075\r", 
  ".W": "In gonadectomized animals, pulses of LH are secreted concurrently with pulsatile hypothalamic GnRH and it is hypothesized that pulses of GnRH are either driven or modulated by episodes of catecholamine release. The objective of this study was to determine if the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (PHEN) can simultaneously block the release of GnRH and LH in ovariectomized (OVX) rhesus macaques. In Exp 1, simultaneous peripheral blood and mediobasal hypothalamic push-pull perfusion (PPP) samples were collected remotely at 10-min intervals for 24 h via a swivel/tether device in eight conscious, freely moving OVX rhesus monkeys. Phentolamine was continuously infused iv for 6 h at the rate of 4 mg/kg BW.h in five animals and 20 mg/kg BW.h in three animals. Infusion started at 6 h after the commencement of PPP. Sampling of PPP and blood continued for 12 h after the cessation of PHEN infusion. Exp 2 was carried out to determine if PHEN affects pituitary responsiveness to exogenous GnRH under conditions similar to those in Exp 1. Exogenous GnRH (5 micrograms, iv) was injected as a single bolus at 10-h intervals before, during, and after either a saline (4 ml/h for 6 h) infusion or, 3 weeks later, a PHEN infusion (4 mg/kgBW.h for 6 h) in three OVX females. The results of Exp 1 show that pulsatile patterns of hypothalamic GnRH and LH were either dampened or abolished by PHEN infusion. During the recovery period after PHEN infusion, pulse amplitudes of LH were enhanced, but pulse amplitudes of endogenous GnRH did not differ, as compared to those of corresponding LH and GnRH before infusion of PHEN. Data from Exp 2 suggested that the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent had no effect on the pituitary LH response to exogenous GnRH administration. These results directly support the hypothesis that adrenergic neuronal activities are critical for the pulsatile release of hypothalamic GnRH which governs the pulsatile release of LH in gonadectomized animals.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanism by which PTH and other osteotropic substances stimulate bone resorption is unclear. One hypothesis is that PTH-stimulated osteoblasts release cytokines which activate osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors. To examine whether cytokines are released by osteoblast-like cells in vitro, medium conditioned by a clonal rat osteosarcoma cell line 17/2.8 (ROS) was examined for mitogenic activity using a helper T lymphocyte line HT-2. This line proliferates in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM CSF). Conditioned medium (CM) from untreated ROS cells caused proliferation of HT-2 cells. Treatment of ROS cells with PTH or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused a dose-dependent increase in the secretion of this mitogenic activity. To further define the nature of this mitogenic activity, we examined the effect of incubation of CM with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2, IL-4, and GM CSF. Mitogenic activity induced by both PTH- and LPS-treated ROS cell CM was completely inhibited by anti-GM CSF antibody, whereas there was no reduction in activity in the presence of antibodies to IL-2 or IL-4. Partial purification of both PTH- and LPS-treated CM using reverse phase HPLC resulted in a single peak of HT-2 mitogenic activity, which in both cases was completely inhibited by anti-GM CSF antibody. These findings suggest that PTH- and LPS-treated ROS cells secrete a T cell mitogenic activity which, by functional, serological, and biochemical criteria, is indistinguishable from GM CSF.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on the production of collagen by cultures of human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Insulin at 20 ng/ml increased collagen accumulation by 58% and total protein formation by 18%. At 2 micrograms/ml, insulin increased collagen production by 2- to 3-fold and total protein production by 2-fold. The mRNA levels for alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) collagen chains were elevated by insulin compared with untreated control values. IGF-I at 10 ng/ml increased collagen production 2-fold. IGF-I at 100 ng/ml maximally increased collagen production 3-fold. A specific antibody to the IGF-I receptor (alpha IR-3) caused a concentration-related decline in insulin-induced collagen formation. The addition of antibody at 1 micrograms/ml, resulted in 80% inhibition of insulin-induced collagen accumulation. Higher levels of antibody were required to inhibit IGF-I mediated collagen formation. The presence of antibody (alpha IR-3) also blocked fibroblast proliferation stimulated by epidermal growth factor plus insulin. These data show that insulin-induced collagen formation is mediated primarily through an interaction with the IGF-I receptor. The modulation of extracellular matrix production by insulin may influence the repair of tissue injury and the development of the accelerated atherosclerosis that accompanies the diabetic state in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The purified human placental alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin-receptor complex was reduced and dissociated into functional alpha beta heterodimers by a combination of alkaline pH and dithiothreitol treatment. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was observed to stimulate the beta-subunit autophosphorylation of both the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric and alpha beta heterodimeric complexes in the absence of insulin. However, WGA was without effect on the insulin stimulation of beta-subunit autophosphorylation in these insulin-receptor complexes. In contrast, monomeric WGA was unable to stimulate the basal exogenous substrate protein kinase activity in either the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric or alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptor complexes. The stimulatory effect of WGA was biphasic, increasing the basal insulin receptor beta-subunit autophosphorylation at low concentrations (250 ng/ml to 2.5 micrograms/ml) and inhibiting at high concentrations (greater than 25 micrograms/ml). Similarly, equilibrium tracer insulin binding was not significantly altered by low concentrations of WGA (less than 1 microgram/ml) but was dramatically reduced at high WGA concentrations (greater than 2.5 micrograms/ml). In contrast to the insulin-induced covalent association of the alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptors to form a disulfide-linked alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric complex, nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the WGA stimulation of beta-subunit autophosphorylation in the alpha beta heterodimer preparation occurred in the absence of covalent association. Nondenaturing Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration chromatography and [125I]insulin affinity cross-linking demonstrated that WGA treatment of the alpha beta heterodimeric insulin receptors induced a noncovalent association into an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric state. These data support the hypothesis that the insulin receptor protein kinase activity, although dependent upon alpha beta heterodimeric subunit interactions, does not necessarily require covalent disulfide bond formation between the individual alpha beta heterodimeric species.\r"

No other clinically significant alterations in hematologic or biochemical test results were observed. No treatment-related changes in plasma concentration of concomitant AEDs were noted.

In four patients with acute hepatitis B, pre-S(2)Ag titers changed in parallel with HBV DNA levels, and the disappearance of pre-S(2)Ag from serum was associated with a rapid fall of ALT levels into the normal range, whereas the fluctuation of pre-S(2)Ag titer correlated with persistence of ALT elevations. In all of the 19 episodes of acute exacerbation of hepatitis which occurred in nine patients with chronic active hepatitis B, a significant elevation of pre-S(2)Ag titer was observed, closely overlapping an increase or appearance of HBV DNA, and its peak preceded peaks of ALT by 1 to 11 weeks (mean +/- S.D. = 4.26 +/- 2.57 weeks). These observations suggest that quantitative measurement of pre-S(2)Ag would be useful for estimation of the magnitude of HBV replication and would help predict the prognosis of acute hepatitis B and of acute exacerbation in chronic hepatitis B.\r"

All failed liver allograft specimens with chronic rejection were reviewed and categorized according to the degree of chronic obliterative arteriopathy, assessed by the degree of luminal narrowing of hilar hepatic artery branches. Histometric analysis of the grafts revealed: (i) there was a loss of small portal arterioles (less than 35 microns); (ii) bile ducts which should accompany arteries less than 35, 35 to 54 or 55 to 74 microns in diameter were missing, with the greatest decrease occurring among the smallest ducts; (iii) bile duct loss was seen in the absence of significant large vessel chronic obliterative arteriopathy, and (iv) the severity of arteriole and bile duct loss, as well as the size of the vanished ducts, was directly proportional to the degree of chronic obliterative arteriopathy. Furthermore, the size of the \"vanished\" bile ducts in liver allografts appeared to differ from the size of ducts destroyed in primary biliary cirrhosis. These studies offer indirect, but suggestive proof that two mechanisms are operative in the bile duct loss seen in chronic rejection: direct lymphocytotoxicity and ischemic damage.\r"

Nine patients with inactive autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 13 with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and five with fulminant hepatic failure had ratios similar to controls. In nine patients with Wilson's disease, there was a modest but significant increase in binding ratio. In four children with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, binding ratios fell during effective immunosuppressive therapy. Sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis gave normal results, excluding that binding derives from Fc-mediated immune complex capture. A positive correlation was found between Alexander cell binding values and anti-liver-specific protein antibody titers, suggesting that the two assays detect antibodies against shared antigenic determinants.

This \"heat supernatant\" and fractions derived from the subsequent purification steps were tested for growth stimulatory activity in two rat hepatoma cell lines. The undifferentiated, fibroblastoid-like HTC hepatoma cells did not respond to crude hepatic stimulator substance or any of the partially purified preparations. In contrast, MH1C1 cells, which display some differentiated hepatic functions and epithelial morphology, reacted to hepatic stimulator substance and the purified fractions with a dose-dependent increase of their growth rate in serum-free culture. Although insulin, glucagon and epidermal growth factor showed only a minor effect on MH1C1 cell growth on their own, they were active as permissive or potentiating factors for the expression of the maximal effect of hepatic stimulator substance. Similarly, normal adult rat hepatocytes were only sensitive to hepatic stimulator substance when cultured in the simultaneous presence of epidermal growth factor. Under such conditions, hepatic stimulator substance stimulated hepatocyte entry into the S-phase of the cell cycle 3-fold compared to epidermal growth factor alone.

The results indicate that the hemodynamic effects of AGEPC in perfused rat liver cause the apparent loss of tissue space accessible to small permeant compounds. Phenylephrine, although increasing hepatic vascular resistance, measured at the portal vein, by the same magnitude as AGEPC, led to an increase in the apparent tissue space accessible to this same species.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of normal and retrograde rat liver perfusion has been widely used to probe zonal differences in drug-metabolizing activities. The validity of this approach mandates the same tissue spaces being accessed by substrates during both normal and retrograde perfusions. Using the multiple-indicator dilution technique, we presently examine the extent to which retrograde perfusion alters the spaces accessible to noneliminated references. A bolus dose of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells, 125I-albumin, 14C-sucrose and 3H2O was injected into the portal (normal) or hepatic (retrograde) vein of rat livers perfused at 10 ml per min per liver. The outflow perfusate was serially collected over 220 sec to characterize the transit times and the distribution spaces of the labels. During retrograde perfusion, red blood cells, albumin and sucrose profiles peaked later and lower than during normal perfusion, whereas the water curves were similar. The transit times of red blood cells, albumin and sucrose were longer (p less than 0.005), whereas those for water did not change. Consequently, retrograde flow resulted in significantly larger sinusoidal blood volumes (45%), albumin Disse space (42%) and sucrose Disse space (25%) than during normal flow, whereas the distribution spaces for total and intracellular water remained unaltered. The distension of the vascular tree was confirmed by electron microscopy, by which occasional isolated foci of widened intercellular recesses and spaces of Disse were observed. Cellular ultrastructure was otherwise unchanged, and there was no difference found between normal and retrograde perfusion for bile flow rates, AST release, perfusion pressure, oxygen consumption and metabolic removal of ethanol, a substrate with flow-limited distribution, which equilibrates rapidly with cell water (hepatic extraction ratios were virtually identical: normal vs. retrograde, 0.50 vs. 0.48 at 6 to 7.4 mM input concentration). These findings suggest that the functional and metabolic capacities of the liver remain unperturbed during retrograde perfusion, rendering the technique suitable for the investigation of zonal differences in drug-metabolizing enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of aging upon liver volume and apparent liver blood flow in healthy man. Sixty-five subjects between 24 and 91 years of age were recruited. Liver volume was quantitated by a gray scale B ultrasound scan method. Apparent liver blood flow was determined from the plasma clearance of indocyanine green, based on an assumption of no change in hepatic extraction of the dye with age. A significant negative correlation was observed between age and both liver volume and apparent liver blood flow (p less than 0.001), whether expressed in absolute terms or per unit body weight. Similarly, a significant negative correlation was observed between apparent liver blood flow per unit volume of liver (liver perfusion) and age (p less than 0.005). The reduction in liver volume, apparent liver blood flow and perfusion may at least partly account for the decline in the clearance of many drugs undergoing liver metabolism which has been noted to occur with aging in man.\r"

The lesions occurred most frequently in the spine, tibia, and femur; three patients had vertebra plana.

Biopsy is recommended, and results of cultures must be negative before therapy with antibiotics can be withheld.\r"

Forty-seven patients who were scheduled to have arthroscopy and three patients who wer to have arthrotomy volunteered for magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively. The radiologists had no clinical or roentgenographic information about the patients before the evaluation of the magnetic resonance images, and the radiologists' interpretations were unknown to the surgeon before the arthroscopy or arthrotomy was done. Our important observations were limited to the findings in the menisci and in the anterior cruciate ligament. Magnetic resonance imaging had a positive predictive value of 75 per cent, a negative predictive value of 90 per cent, a sensitivity of 83 per cent, and a specificity of 84 per cent for pathological findings in the menisci. For complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, the positive predictive value was 74 per cent; the negative predictive value, 70 per cent; the sensitivity, 61 per cent; and the specificity, 82 per cent. We believe that magnetic resonance imaging, when combined with clinical and roentgenographic examination, provides the most accurate non-invasive source of information that is currently available for pathological findings in the menisci and in the anterior cruciate ligament.\r"

The patients in the two groups were matched for age, sex, level of the lesion, and intelligence. Only twelve of the patients who had been able to walk at an early age were still able to do so effectively at the time of this study, when their ages ranged from twelve to twenty years, but still these patients fared somewhat better than the other patients did. The patients who walked early had fewer fractures and pressure sores, were more independent, and were better able to transfer than were the patients who had used a wheelchair from early in life. However, during childhood and early adolescence, the patients who had always used a wheelchair had spent fewer days in the hospital than did those who had participated in the walking program. There were no major differences between the two groups with regard to skills of daily living, function of the hands, and frequency and severity of obesity.\r"

The distribution of cartilage matrix in callus was determined by histochemical staining. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for cartilage-specific type-II collagen was detectable as early as the fifth day in a small number of cells that had acquired a chondrocyte phenotype but that also contained type-I collagen mRNA, suggesting an ongoing change in the expression of collagen genes. The location of the first chondrocytes, which were adjacent to cortical bone, suggested that they originated from cells that had derived from the periosteum by differentiation. On the seventh day of callus formation, the presence of both type-I and type-II collagen mRNA in chondrocytes of expanding cartilage suggested that most growth occurred by differentiation of mesenchymal cells and less by proliferation of differentiated chondrocytes. Expansion continued until the tenth to fourteenth day, after which the cartilage was replaced by woven bone. This was characterized by the presence of osteoblasts that were active in the synthesis of type-I collagen.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) is an inhibitor of platelet function in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that PGI2 is formed in biologically active concentrations at the platelet-vascular interface in man and can be pharmacologically modulated to enhance its inhibitory properties. This became feasible when we developed a microquantitative technique that permits the measurement of eicosanoids in successive 40-microliters aliquots of whole blood emerging from a bleeding time wound. In 13 healthy volunteers the rate of production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 421 +/- 90 (mean +/- SEM) fg/microliters per s at 300 +/- 20 s. The hydration product of PGI2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, rose earlier and to a lesser degree, reaching a peak (68 +/- 34 fg/microliters per s) at 168 +/- 23 s. The generation of prostaglandins PGE2 and D2 resembled that of PGI2. Whereas the threshold concentration of PGI2 for an effect on platelets in vitro is approximately 30 fg/microliters, only less than 3 fg/microliters circulates under physiological conditions. By contrast, peak concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha obtained locally after vascular damage averaged 305 fg/microliters. Pharmacological regulation of PG endoperoxide metabolism at the platelet-vascular interface was demonstrated by administration of a TX synthase inhibitor. The rate of production of PGI2, PGE2, and PGD2 increased coincident with inhibition of TXA, as reflected by three indices; the concentration of TXB2 in bleeding time blood and serum, and excretion of the urinary metabolite, 2,3-dinor-TXB2. These studies indicate that PGI2 is formed locally in biologically effective concentrations at the site of vessel injury and provide direct evidence in support of transcellular metabolism of PG endoperoxides in man.\r"

Our analyses on 10 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines by immunofluorescence tests and RIA, demonstrate that all the human HCC cell lines tested express class I MHC antigens and among them, three poorly differentiated human HCC cell lines also express class II MHC antigens. Results of immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting experiments indicate similarity in the chemical nature of both the class I and class II MHC antigens expressed by the human HCC cell lines and by a human B lymphoblastoid cell line Raji. Furthermore, a new variant form of class I antigen was detected in some of these HCC cell lines. Immunohistochemical studies of HCC tissues using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining method indicated that class I and class II antigens were detectable in 7 out of 11 and 3 out of 11 HCC tissues from patients, respectively. The availability of MHC class I antigen-positive cultured HCC cell lines, including the poorly differentiated lines that also express MHC class II antigen, has provided us with interesting models to study the relationship between expression of MHC antigen and transformation and differentiation of human hepatocytes. These studies will also allow us some insight into the role of MHC class I and class II antigen in the immunosensitivity and immunogenicity of HCC cells to the host-immune response.\r"

Previously we have shown that M-sites are glucose transporters in hPBMC (Mookerjee, B.K., et al. 1981. J. Biol. Chem. 256:1290-1300). Equilibrium exchange of 3-O-methyl D-glucose in unstimulated cells revealed two populations with fast and slow flux rates. Phytohemagglutinin stimulates flux rates by converting part of the slow flux population to the fast flux population. M-sites occur in two distinct pools, one in plasma membrane and the other in microsomal fraction. Phytohemagglutinin treatment increases the plasma membrane pool size of M-sites with a concomitant reduction in the microsomal pool size without affecting the binding affinities or the total number of M-sites/cell. Data presented in this paper demonstrate that there are two pools of glucose transporters in these cells and phytohemagglutinin stimulation induces an energy-dependent net translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular reserve pool to the plasma membrane, which accounts for greater than 60% of the increment in glucose transport.\r"

  ".U": "89109556\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to understand the regulatory mechanisms governing passage of neutrophils from the vascular bed to the interstitial tissue, we analyzed the effect of the pleiotropic monokines interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on transendothelial neutrophil traffic. Short-time preincubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVE) monolayers with IL-1 and TNF led to an impressive time- and dose-dependent increase of endothelial cell-associated neutrophils when working in a full plasma system on petri dishes. Electron microscopic analysis revealed junctional penetration of monolayers by neutrophils. More quantitatively, when using a monolayer-on-filter-system, priming led to a severalfold increase in complete layer passage occurring in the absence of an external chemotactic gradient. Direct comparison with an upside-down modification of the system together with data demonstrating the vectorial behavior of such migration revealed that IL-1-stimulated transendothelial neutrophil traffic is polarized. The described enhancement of neutrophil transendothelial passage was found to be a unique feature of IL-1/TNF-activated HUVE since HUVE-dependent transmigration potentiation was not observed as a consequence of mere neutrophil attachment to endothelial cells (e.g., induced by Fc-mediated adherence of PMN to HUVE). IL-1 acts selectively on endothelial cells as demonstrated by total inhibition of its effect by actinomycin D. Moreover, IL-1 does not induce HUVE monolayers to secrete a chemotaxin, and the neutrophil passage guiding principle is removable from the HUVE surface by short trypsin exposure. Congruent results were obtained with human adult arterial as well as saphenous vein endothelial cells. As shown by blockade of neutrophil migration with pertussis toxin, IL-1- and TNF-inducible transendothelial migration can be dissected into an initial anchoring step, which is succeeded by active neutrophil migration, possibly along a putative endothelial membrane-bound gradient.\r"

The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for artesunate in HbH (alpha-thal 1/alpha-thal 2), HbH (alpha-thal 1/Hb Constant Spring), and homozygous Hb Constant Spring erythrocytes were 4.5 +/- 2.8, 8.5 +/- 3.2, and 2.6 +/- 1.6 nM compared with 0.82 +/- 0.35 nM in normal erythrocytes (P less than 0.002 for all three cases). The IC50 for chloroquine were 97 +/- 46, 162 +/- 67, and 93 +/- 36 nM, respectively, in the variant erythrocytes, compared with 48 +/- 13 nM in normal erythrocytes (P less than 0.002, 0.002, and 0.02, respectively). The differences in sensitivity to artesunate and chloroquine of the parasite infecting HbH erythrocytes are probably related to their oxidative mode of action and relatively high amounts of antioxidant enzymes in the host erythrocytes. This novel example of dependence on the host of the malarial parasite drug sensitivity may have implications for chemotherapy of malaria in patients with genetically variant erythrocytes.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if end diastole is the best portion of the cardiac cycle to sample, or if other sampling schemes produce more precise and/or reproducible estimates of coronary disease. 20 cinecoronary angiograms were selected at random from a controlled clinical trial testing the effects of plasma lipid lowering on atherosclerosis. Sampling schemes included sequential and random sampling of two to five frames within the complete cardiac cycle, systole, and diastole. Three vessel measures and percent stenosis were evaluated for each sampling scheme. From the sampling experiment, it was determined that sampling sequentially end diastole yielded the most precise estimates (i.e., exhibiting minimum variability within a cycle) of the vessel measures. With regard to reproducibility (i.e., similar values across cycles), sampling randomly within the cycle was best. Overall, the average diameter of a vessel segment was the most precise and the most reproducible of the measures. Sample size calculations are given for each of these measures under the best sampling scheme.\r"

GM-CSF increased the number of circulating granulocytes and monocytes; platelets, erythrocytes, lymphocyte number, and subsets were unmodified. GM-CSF increased the percentage of BM S phase BFU-E (from 32 +/- 7 to 79 +/- 16%), day 14 colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) (from 43 +/- 20 to 82 +/- 11%) and day 7 CFU-GM (from 41 +/- 14 to 56 +/- 20%). The percentage of BM myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes in S phase increased from 26 +/- 14 to 41 +/- 6%, and that of erythroblasts increased from 25 +/- 12 to 30 +/- 12%. This suggests that GM-CSF activates both erythroid and granulomonopoietic progenitors but that, among the morphologically recognizable BM precursors, only the granulomonopoietic lineage is a direct target of the molecule. GM-CSF increased the birth rate of cycling cells from 1.3 to 3.4 cells %/h and decreased the duration of the S phase from 14.3 to 9.1 h and the cell cycle time from 86 to 26 h. After treatment discontinuation, the number of circulating granulocytes and monocytes rapidly fell. The proportion of S phase BM cells dropped to values lower than pretreatment levels, suggesting a period of relative refractoriness to cell cycle-active antineoplastic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle tissue on lipoprotein metabolism was investigated in six healthy men. The knee extensors were studied at rest and during exercise after 8 wk of dynamic exercise training of the knee extensors of one leg, while the other leg served as a control. The trained and nontrained thighs were investigated on different occasions. In the trained knee extensors, muscle (m) lipoprotein lipase activity (LPLA) was 70 +/- 29% higher compared with the nontrained (P less than 0.05), and correlated positively with the capillary density (r = 0.84). At rest there was a markedly higher arteriovenous (A-V) VLDL triacylglycerol (TG) difference over the trained thigh, averaging 55 mumol/liter (range 30-123), than over the nontrained, averaging 30 mumol/liter (4-72). In addition to the higher LPLA and VLDL-TG uptake in the trained thigh, a higher production of HDL cholesterol (C) and HDL2-C was also observed (P less than 0.05). Positive correlations between m-LPLA and A-V differences of VLDL-TG (r = 0.90; P less than 0.05) were observed only in the trained thigh. During exercise with the trained thigh the venous concentration of HDL2-C was invariably higher than the arterial, and after 110 min of exercise a production of 88 mumol/min (54-199) of HDL2-C was revealed. Even though a consistent degradation of VLDL-TG was not found during exercise, the total production of HDL-C across the trained and nontrained thigh, estimated from A-V differences times venous blood flow for the whole exercise period, correlated closely with the total estimated degradation of VLDL-TG (r = 0.91). At the end of 2 h of exercise m-LPLA did not differ from the preexercise value in either the nontrained or the trained muscle. We conclude that changes in the lipoprotein profile associated with endurance training to a large extent are explainable by training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle tissue.\r"

Colonies were individually plucked and cell lines were developed that could be analyzed for expression of growth factors. The data show that unstimulated marrow stromal cells lines produced no detectable colony-stimulating activity. However, cell lines derived from \"autonomously growing colonies\" and from colonies grown with T cell-conditioned medium, with IL-1 alpha or beta, or with TNF alpha produced colony-stimulating activity and transcripts for granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-1 beta. A novel feature of the cell lines derived from colonies was that the production of growth factors was constitutive and persisted in excess of 4 m.\r"

  ".U": "89109581\r", 
  ".W": "The process of neutrophil adhesion to and migration through the microvascular endothelium, an early event in the induction of the acute inflammatory response, has been attributed to the generation of extravascular chemoattractants. Although both chemotactic peptides and lipid mediators enhance neutrophil adherence in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism(s) involved in the interaction between circulating neutrophils and microvascular endothelial cells is still not completely understood. In a microtiter well adherence assay, the chemotactic peptides, FMLP and C5a, and the lipid mediators, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF), enhanced human neutrophil adherence to cultured human microvascular endothelial cells as well as to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner with a rapid time course. This stimulated adhesive interaction between neutrophils and cultured human endothelial cells was dependent on the expression of the Mac-1, LFA-1, p150,95 glycoprotein family on the neutrophil surface since neutrophils from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, lacking surface expression of the adhesive glycoproteins, exhibited markedly diminished adherence to human endothelial cells in response to stimulation with chemotactic factors compared to normal control neutrophils. All four mediators enhanced expression of the glycoprotein family on the surface of normal neutrophils as determined by flow cytofluorimetry using a monoclonal antibody (TS1/18) to the glycoprotein common beta subunit. In addition, TS1/18 inhibited up to 100% the adherence of normal neutrophils to endothelial cells stimulated by maximal concentrations of FMLP, C5a, LTB4, or PAF. Moreover, HL-60 cells, human promyelocytic leukemia cells, neither increased glycoprotein surface expression nor adherence in response to stimulation. Thus, peptide and lipid mediators of the acute inflammatory response appear to enhance adherence of circulating neutrophils to the microvascular endothelium by a mechanism dependent on expression of the Mac-1, LFA-1, p150,95 glycoprotein family on the neutrophil surface.\r"

  ".W": "We employed a novel immunoradiometric assay to measure plasma levels of active renin and prorenin in physiologic and pharmacologic studies designed to characterize renin biosynthesis and processing in response to both chronic and acute stimuli of renin secretion in normal human subjects. Stimulation of renin secretion with prolonged dietary sodium restriction or amiloride resulted in marked increases in the plasma levels of prorenin, active renin, and plasma renin activity (PRA); suppression of renin secretion with indomethacin resulted in parallel decreases in prorenin, active renin, and PRA. In contrast, acute stimulation with upright activity or administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which increased active renin and PRA from 2- to 15-fold, had no effect on prorenin levels. Based on studies in cultured human juxtaglomerular tumor cells, it has been proposed that prorenin is secreted constitutively whereas active renin is stored in and released from secretory granules through a regulated pathway. Our studies are consistent with such a model: the parallel changes in active renin and prorenin with experimental maneuvers of long duration suggest that both the constitutive and regulated pathways are altered under these conditions. The increase in active renin levels in the absence of a change in prorenin that occurs in response to acute stimuli presumably represents the release of preformed active enzyme that is stored in secretory granules.\r"

These experiments extend the range of biological actions of endothelin to stimulation of mitogenesis. Endothelin at low concentrations (0.1-10 nM) induced mitogenesis by quiescent rat glomerular mesangial cells in culture. Mitogenesis induced by endothelin was accompanied by activation of phospholipase C with increased inositol phosphate turnover and increments of intracellular [Ca2+]. Endothelin also activated Na+/H+ exchange, causing cytosolic alkalinization, and enhanced transcription of the c-fos protooncogene, additional biochemical signals closely linked to proliferation. In addition to being a vasoconstrictor, endothelin thus also functions as a mitogen, presumably through activation of phospholipase C.\r"

Collagen sclerosis, accompanied by a strong palisading pattern of histiocytes, was more frequent in localized granuloma annulare. Results of microdroplet lipid staining were positive in 80% of annulare cases and 39.3% of nonannulare cases of generalized granuloma annulare. Inflammatory cells were confined to peripheral perivascular lymphocytes; bandlike granuloma below the epidermis was observed. Positive results of direct immunofluorescence tests in 12 of 23 patients with generalized granuloma annulare suggested that fibrin deposition in areas of altered collagen is less frequent in the generalized than in the localized form, a possible reflection of the lower rate of histologic collagen alteration in that group. Lymphohistiocytic granuloma with various degrees of collagen degeneration, microdroplet lipid accumulation, and mucin deposition form the basic pathologic description of granuloma annulare.\r"

In 36 of 37 basal cell carcinomas (97%) there was no expression of HLA-DR on tumor cells of basal cell carcinoma. In 13 of 37 basal cell carcinomas (35%) beta 2-microglobulin was expressed on the tumor cells. Both a diffuse cytoplasmic and a membrane staining were observed in only six of these 13 basal a diffuse cytoplasmic and a membrane staining were observed in only six of these 13 basal cell carcinomas; in the other seven basal cell carcinomas only a diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed. In all 37 basal cell carcinomas there was membrane staining for beta 2-microglobulin in the normal epidermis. The intensity of staining in the normal epidermis was always stronger than that in the tumor nests. There was a varying degree of peritumoral immune infiltrate in all basal cell carcinomas. It comprised mainly T cells (mean percentage 57 +/- 15). In the group of patients with basal cell carcinoma with moderate to heavy infiltrate the mean percentage of T cells was 63 +/- 13, which was significantly higher than the mean percentage of T cells (46% +/- 14%) in the group of patients with basal cell carcinoma with a mild infiltrate. This difference was mainly the result of an increase in T helper cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This paper reviews the current data on dentists' involvement in smoking cessation counseling. Three areas are examined: smoking practices of dentists, dentists' attitudes toward involvement in smoking cessation counseling, and the self-reported counseling activities of dentists with their patients. The results suggest that the number of dentists who smoke is declining. In addition, most dentists agree that dentistry should be involved in smoking cessation counseling, but up to a third do not advise patients about smoking. The data also suggest a need for continuing education regarding counseling strategies.\r"

Four major areas are highlighted including cardiac muscle, the blood vessel, atherosclerosis and thrombosis/thrombolysis. The remarkable strides in understanding multifactorial diseases such as atherosclerosis, and the development of innovative new therapies such as the use of thrombolytic agents produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology, are noted. Moreover, it is concluded that the past decade of basic research has provided a solid framework for improvements in the diagnosis and therapy of other forms of cardiovascular disease as well. An evaluation of current trends in basic cardiovascular research suggests that diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to disease will increasingly target specific molecular processes underlying the pathophysiologic state.\r"

Orifice area was directly related to mean flow (Q), although cusp opening behavior was asymmetric and complex and varied among the individual valves. There was a strong correlation between measured orifice area (OA) and the modified Gorlin relation, Q/V max (r = 0.88; p less than 0.00001) given by the regression formula OA = 0.18 x Q/V max - 0.15. There was also a good correlation between measured orifice area and the conventional Gorlin relation, Q/root mean pressure drop. The derived empiric Gorlin constant did not vary significantly with flow.\r"

However, the introduction of oxygen and cellular elements, especially the neutrophil, into the ischemic zone may initiate a deleterious cascade of events that limits myocardial salvage after reperfusion. Although the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury remains controversial, recent studies have suggested that the endothelium may play a critical role. Endothelial cells maintain flow in the microcirculation by secreting a number of vasodilatory compounds and substances that prevent plugging of capillaries by inhibiting neutrophil adherence and platelet aggregation. Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium accelerates structural and functional changes in endothelial cells, resulting in a progressive decrease in microcirculatory flow (\"no reflow\" phenomenon). Numerous studies suggest that activated neutrophils mediate vascular damage by releasing reactive oxygen species and potent proteolytic enzymes. The administration of therapeutic agents that limit endothelial disruption and neutrophil plugging has shown promising results in limiting myocardial reperfusion injury in experimental models.\r"

To examine the underlying mechanisms responsible for this common phenomenon, 12 subjects ingested control foods and positive foods (foods that cause rhinorrhea). Nasal lavages performed 10 minutes after each food challenge were analyzed for albumin and total protein. Positive food challenge, but not control food challenge, induced rhinorrhea in all subjects. Positive food challenge increased albumin (7.8 +/- 1.9 to 24.5 +/- 7.6 mg/L; p less than 0.025) and total protein (79 +/- 9 to 258 +/- 41 mg/L; p less than 0.001) without altering the ratio of albumin to total protein (albumin percent). Nasal pretreatment with atropine clinically blocked the positive food-induced rhinorrhea and significantly inhibited secretion of both albumin and total protein, again without affecting the albumin percent. Thus, gustatory rhinitis is produced by spicy foods that stimulate atropine-inhibitable muscarinic receptors (probably on submucosal glands), and the syndrome can be treated prophylactically by use of topical atropine.\r"

Antigen challenge of fragments of guinea pig lung tissue that were passively sensitized with IgE or IgG antibody evoked the release of neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) in parallel with histamine. The NCA released from lung tissue by both IgG- and IgE-dependent stimulation coeluted from a column of Sephacryl S-300 with synthetic leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The NCA in eluates from the Sephacryl S-300 column contained LTB4, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassay, in quantities that accounted for the observed chemoattractant activity in the eluates. Furthermore, the NCA of supernatants from antigen-challenged lung fragments was reduced by a mean of 80% after absorption with a monoclonal antibody to LTB4. LTB4 thus constitutes the major functional constituent of NCA released after anaphylactic challenge of IgE- and IgG-sensitized guinea pig lung tissue.\r"

  ".U": "89109889\r", 
  ".W": "Although late bronchospastic reactions after exposure to antigenic and sensitizing agents usually significantly alter bronchial responsiveness to histamine or methacholine, presumably by causing bronchial inflammation, isolated immediate bronchospastic reactions do not induce such changes. We studied three subjects who demonstrated different patterns of reaction. The first individual was diagnosed as having occupational asthma to red cedar. This was confirmed by specific inhalation challenges that resulted in late bronchospastic reaction. No significant changes in the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) were found 1 day after this reaction. Two weeks later, serial assessments (five and six, respectively) of PC20 histamine were recorded on control days and up to 48 hours after exposure to plicatic acid, which caused a late bronchospastic reaction with a maximum fall of 37% in FEV1. No significant changes in PC20 were found; the maximum variations on control days were 0.36 to 0.74 mg/ml, and on active days, from 0.37 to 0.59 mg/ml. By contrast, two other subjects, who demonstrated isolated immediate reactions after exposure to diphenylmethane diisocyanate, had significant changes in PC20 histamine and methacholine, in one subject from 3.1 mg/ml to 0.6 mg/ml 8 hours after exposure, and in the other subject, from 61.0 to 7.4 mg/ml 7 hours after exposure, with recovery during the next few days. These examples demonstrate that the pattern of nonspecific bronchial responsiveness after immediate and late bronchospastic reactions can be different from what has previously been described. Immediate bronchospastic reactions may lead to bronchial hyperresponsiveness, whereas late asthmatic reactions do not always induce changes in bronchial responsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigates the role of APC in inducing tumor-specific in vivo protective immunity. Thy-1+ cell-depleted, Mac-1+ cell-enriched fraction of normal BALB/c spleen cells were used as a source of APC. These APC were cultured in vitro with the membrane fraction isolated from CSA1M fibrosarcoma derived from BALB/c strain. The administration of such APC into naive BALB/c mice generated the capacity of these animals to reject the subsequently challenged viable CSA1M tumor cells. Although the induction of anti-CSA1M in vivo protective immunity required three consecutive immunizations with more than 10(5) APC which had been pulsed in vitro with 200 to 300 micrograms protein of CSA1M membrane fraction, the immunity was induced irrespective of whether APC were administered via s.c., i.v., or i.p. route. This immunity was tumor-specific, inasmuch as the inoculation of CSA1M or Meth A fibrosarcoma membrane component-pulsed APC resulted in the selective immunity against the challenge with homologous types of tumor cells. The CSA1M-specific in vivo protective immunity was also induced by injecting APC pulsed with solubilized CSA1M membrane components. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the efficiency for inducing anti-CSA1M immunity was much higher in the utilization of tumor Ag-pulsed APC than in the immunization with tumor Ag emulsified in CFA. These results indicate the critical role of APC in generating tumor rejection immunity in vivo and this model presents a novel approach to induce tumor-specific immunity without using tumor cells themselves.\r"

Although homozygosity at the NOD MHC is required for a high prevalence of disease, during backcross studies we have found a small number of diabetic H-2nod/b MHC heterozygotes. These diabetic heterozygotes could either represent a crossover event between the MHC and a putative MHC-linked diabetogenic gene or, alternatively, they could indicate that there is a dominant MHC-linked diabetic gene that has low penetrance in the heterozygous state. Pedigree analysis of a diabetic H-2nod/b MHC heterozygote favors the latter hypothesis.\r"

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against mature rIL-1 have been used to investigate the intracellular location of the IL-1 beta precursor in U937 cells. The pattern of indirect immunofluorescence staining seen with these antibodies overlaps substantially with that seen by using a mAb raised against beta-tubulin. Depolymerization of tubulin by incubation of the cells at 0 degrees C before fixation results in the disruption of the pattern of IL-1 staining. IL-1 beta precursor in extracts of activated U937 cells is shown to co-cycle with exogenously added tubulin through two rounds of in vitro depolymerization/polymerization. In addition, immunoprecipitation of IL-1 from cell extracts at 30 degrees C but not at 0 degrees C results in co-precipitation of tubulin. Thus the IL-1 beta precursor is shown in vivo and in vitro to associate with the microtubules of the cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "Human rIL-1 alpha was shown to be a potent stimulus of granulopoiesis in mice that have been myelosuppressed with cyclophosphamide. Stimulation of granulopoiesis was demonstrated in IL-1-treated mice by an accelerated recovery of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, bone marrow and splenic granulocytic hyperplasia, and a profound granulocytosis. Granulopoiesis was stimulated by IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 micrograms/kg. Maximal increases in granulocytes were observed after 4 days of IL-1 treatment. Mice treated with IL-1 also exhibited increased splenic megakaryopoiesis with a resultant increase in the number of peripheral blood platelets. In contrast to these positive effects on hemopoiesis, bone marrow, but not splenic, erythropoiesis was depressed in IL-1-treated mice. IL-1 effects were observed in mice treated with a wide dose range (50 to 300 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide, with optimal effects occurring at a dose of 200 mg/kg. The doses of IL-1 leading to enhanced granulopoiesis caused only minor and transient changes in selected clinical chemistry parameters and caused no toxicities that were evident by histologic examination of tissues. The stimulation of granulopoiesis in the absence of overt toxicity suggests that IL-1 may be useful clinically to enhance the recovery of granulocytes in myelosuppressed patients.\r"

  ".W": "PG are known to inhibit T cell proliferation, at least in part by suppressing IL-2 production, but effects of PG on the production of other lymphokines have not been well studied. We have found that PGE2 and PGE1, but not PGF2 alpha, inhibit both proliferation and production of granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF by murine TH clones stimulated with Ag or anti-CD3 antibody. Thus, signals generated via the Ag receptor:CD3 complex were inhibited by PGE. Most interesting, however, was the finding that PGE2 and PGE1 could act synergistically with IL-2 for the induction of GM-CSF in some TH1 clones. Dependence on PGE2 for this response was not found in all clones, as some TH1 cells could produce GM-CSF after IL-2 alone, and some cells did not produce GM-CSF even in the presence of PGE2 and IL-2. These observations indicate that there is a subset of TH1 cells receptive to a stimulating activity of PGE2 in the presence of IL-2. PGE2 is known to elevate cAMP levels in T cells. Therefore, we tested whether other agents known to increase cAMP, such as forskolin and cholera toxin, could act in conjunction with IL-2 to induce GM-CSF secretion. As was found with PGE2, these compounds also induced GM-CSF activity in the presence of IL-2, suggesting a critical role for cAMP in this process. Overall these data indicate that the requirements for activation of GM-CSF secretion vary among individual T cells. Most importantly they provide the first evidence that E-series PG are positive signals for lymphokine induction in certain T cells, whereas simultaneously acting as negative signals limiting proliferation. This result also suggests that treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs that decrease PGE2 concentrations may inhibit lymphokine secretion normally stimulated by this pathway.\r"

We present detailed evidence that one of these monoclonal antibodies, M7B1-5.1-F9 (F9), interacts with the mouse IL-3 receptor or with part of an IL-3R complex. F9 is a full agonist (80 to 100%) of IL-3 in proliferation assays, with a half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) of 0.2 to 2.0 nM. However, in the variant cell line, NFS60.8, the EC50 for F9 is 30 nM. The decreased sensitivity to the antibody is also paralleled by an increased requirement (EC50) for IL-3. Two stromal cell lines also show increased requirements for IL-3 and F9. F9 stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same set of proteins phosphorylated after IL-3 interaction with the IL-3R, suggesting that IL-3 and F9 activate the same tyrosine kinase. F9 specifically inhibits 125I-IL-3 binding at a concentration (IC50) of about 300 nM, two log10 orders of magnitude higher than that required for its agonistic effects, suggesting that spare receptors may exist. In cross-linking assays, F9 blocks the specific binding of 125I-IL-3 to proteins of Mr 140, 130, and 70 kDa. Thus, F9 interacts with the IL-3R at or near the binding site, which leads to the stimulation of a tyrosine kinase and cell proliferation.\r"

We have examined the mechanism of this serum resistance in RH and P strain organisms, which differ markedly in virulence, but are equally resistant to serum killing. Rapid, but limited, activation of the alternative complement pathway occurred in non-immune human serum, with deposition of equivalent amounts of C3 on the two strains. C component C3 bound covalently to parasite acceptor molecules via an ester linkage. The predominant form of C3 was iC3b which cannot participate in formation of a lytic C5b-9 complex. Multiple membrane constituents of the tachyzoite of T. gondii may serve as acceptors for the limited amount of C3 deposited during incubation in non-immune serum. When tachyzoites were presensitized with the lytic anti-p30 mAb 7B8, new amide-linked C3-acceptor complexes formed. Nearly equivalent C3 binding but a threefold enhancement of 125I-C9 binding occurred when mAb 7B8 pre-sensitized tachyzoites were compared to native organisms. These results indicate that tachyzoites of T. gondii are serum resistant because of failure to activate C efficiently. Presensitization with a lytic mAb alters the site of complement deposition and augments C5b-9 formation.\r"

Using a specific bioassay for IFN-beta 2/IL-6, which relies on the induction of the hepatic acute phase plasma protein alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B clone 2 and its inhibition by anti-rIFN-beta 2/IL-6 antiserum, we have detected high levels of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the body fluids of patients with acute bacterial infections. Cerebrospinal fluid from four patients with acute bacterial meningitis (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, two cases of Listeria monocytogenes) all had high levels of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 (up to 500 ng/ml). Two of these patients with concomitant bacteremia had lower concentrations of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the serum (5 to 70 ng/ml). Three additional patients with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia had high levels of serum IFN-beta 2/IL-6, as did the ankle fluid of a patient with Streptococcus canis arthritis. Normal cerebrospinal fluid and serum had little detectable IFN-beta 2/IL-6. A combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoblotting procedures were used to characterize the IFN-beta 2/IL-6 species present in a representative sampling of serum and cerebrospinal fluids. Multiple immunoreactive species of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in the size range 23 to 30 kDa as well as immunoreactive complexes in the range 60 to 70 kDa were detected in human body fluids. This is the first demonstration that previous descriptions of heterogeneity in human IFN-beta 2/IL-6 species produced in cell culture correspond to observations in the infected host.\r"

  ".W": "To isolate a unit ligand recognized by human monocyte beta-glucan receptors, acid-solubilized oligoglucosides were prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of purified yeast cell walls, gel filtered sequentially on Bio-Gel P-4 and P-2, derivatized with 2-aminopyridine, and separated by normal-phase HPLC. Ligand recognition was assessed by quantitating the effect of pretreatment with isolated materials on the capacities of adherent monocytes to phagocytose zymosan particles. Partial acid hydrolysis solubilized 23 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD; n = 7) of the cell wall glucans; at an input of 50 micrograms/ml, the solubilized products reduced the numbers of monocytes ingesting zymosan by an average of 44%. Gel filtration of acid-solubilized glucans on Bio-Gel P-4 revealed several peaks with phagocytosis-inhibiting activity, and fractions from the peak containing the smallest oligoglucosides, which accounted for 10 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD; n = 7) of the carbohydrate applied, were pooled. Further purification on Bio-Gel P-2 resolved this phagocytosis-inhibiting activity to a single peak that contained apparent heptaoses and accounted for 8 +/- 2% (mean +/- SD; n = 6) of the carbohydrate applied. At a concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml, the oligoglucosides pooled from the Bio-Gel P-4 and P-2 columns reduced the numbers of ingesting monocytes by 45 +/- 1% and 42 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD; n = 3), respectively. When derivatized with 2-aminopyridine, the oligoglucosides were resolved by HPLC to a number of peaks; a peak that eluted as an apparent heptaglucoside contained virtually all the inhibitory activity and accounted for only 6.6 +/- 0.7% (mean +/- SD, n = 7) of the carbohydrate applied. Gas chromatography analysis revealed only glucose and FAB-mass spectrometric analysis showed only heptaglucoside and no noncarbohydrate molecules. At a concentration of 1.6 ng/ml, the derivatized yeast heptaglucoside reduced the numbers of monocytes ingesting zymosan and glucan particles by 44 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD; n = 5) and 45 +/- 6% (n = 3), respectively. Thus, a heptaglucoside present in yeast cell walls is a unit ligand for human monocyte beta-glucan receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli type 1 fimbriae contain in association with the major structural protein a lectin-like adhesin moiety that mediates attachment of E. coli to mannose-containing receptors on the surface of host cells. We have investigated the lymphocyte mitogenic activity of this mannose-specific adhesin by comparing the ability of purified wild type type 1 fimbriae containing the adhesin and mutant type 1 fimbriae lacking the adhesin to stimulate proliferation in human lymphocytes. Both fimbriae stimulated a peak of proliferation at 8 days whereas only the wild type fimbriae stimulated an additional peak of proliferation occurring at 3 days. Proliferation at 3 days but not at 8 days could be blocked by the addition of alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. Neonatal lymphocytes from umbilical cord blood responded to both wild type and mutant fimbriae in a fashion similar to adult cells. Stimulation of separated T and non-T cell populations indicated that the proliferation seen at 3 days was solely due to non-T cells whereas the 8-day response was due to T cell proliferation. The addition of gamma-irradiated T cells did not appear to enhance the 3-day response of the non-T cells. However, the 8-day response by T cells was dependent on the presence of gamma-irradiated non-T cells. In cultures of unseparated cells, wild type fimbriae stimulated more than 75% of the B cells to enter the S and G2 phase at 3 days whereas at 8 days cycling T cells were present in both wild type and mutant fimbriae-stimulated cultures. Taken together, our observations suggest that the adhesin molecule stimulates a polyclonal mitogenic response in B cells that peaks at 3 days, and other structural components of the fimbriae are responsible for evoking an 8-day (probably immune) response in T cells.\r"

Antepartum risk scores at the initial prenatal visit and at 37 weeks' gestation were positively correlated with each other. Antepartum risk scores were correlated with maternal length of stay and maternal hospital charges, but not with gestational age, birth weight, or Apgar scores. Increased intrapartum risk scores were strongly correlated with increasing length of stay for mother and baby, lower birth weight, and lower estimated gestational age at birth. The ability of the risk-scoring system to predict selected adverse outcomes was then assessed using a high-risk cutoff score of 5 or greater. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were found to be quite low while specificity and negative predictive value were reasonably high. The results suggest that the risk-scoring system used at this institution is effective in identifying low obstetrical risk and that prenatal care reduces the probability of poor neonatal outcome among infants of women at high obstetrical risk identified through antepartum multivariate assessment. Two antepartum risk assessments, each measuring different factors, may be redundant. Not yet known are which specific factors by their identification result in more effective prenatal care.\r"

All physicians attended a four-hour training session during which the rationales for the different aspects of the intervention were discussed, including a detailed description of the proper use of nicotine-bearing chewing gum. Patients were randomized to receive an offer of a prescription of 2 mg of nicotine chewing gum in addition to the basic intervention (n = 111) or the basic intervention alone (n = 112). The basic intervention included advice, setting a date for quitting, self-help materials, and the offer of supportive follow-up visits. Receptionists were instructed to recruit the first two smokers attending the practice each day. One-year smoking cessation was validated by cotinine saliva analysis. The validated three-month sustained abstinence rates at one year were 8.1 percent and 9.8 percent in the gum and no-gum groups, respectively. The 95 percent confidence interval about this difference was -9.3 percent to 6.4 percent. There is no evidence from this study that the offer of 2 mg of nicotine-bearing gum enhances smoking cessation rates when added to a comprehensive intervention offered to all smokers in primary care. Until larger trials are completed, however, the possibility that this dose of nicotine gum may produce small beneficial effects cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Essential hypertension is a major health care problem in the elderly and requires effective treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The traditional stepped-care approach to therapy consisted of diuretics; sympatholytic agents, or beta-blockers for all age groups. Indeed, initial therapy with these agents is effective in 50 to 60 percent of elderly patients but may produce adverse effects. A high incidence of adverse responses, including sexual dysfunction and central nervous system impairment, has been reported with diuretic or beta-blocker therapy, and a reduction in several measures of quality of life has been noted during therapy with methyldopa or propranolol. Administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is as effective as the traditional stepped-care approach without producing the ill effects associated with diuretics, sympatholytics, or beta-blockers. The combination of an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic produces additive antihypertensive effects while minimizing diuretic-induced metabolic alterations. Orthostatic hypotension with the first dose can be minimized by making sure that patients are not hypovolemic from previous diuretic therapy. Nevertheless, in controlled trials, the combination of ACE inhibitor and diuretic has been effective in up to 85 percent of patients. In addition, the use of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in the hypertensive patient with concomitant congestive heart failure. Most important, the patient's quality of life is maintained during therapy with an ACE inhibitor alone or in combination with a diuretic. Thus, an ACE inhibitor plus a diuretic is a valuable alternative to traditional antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients.\r"

The attack rate of definite MI also remained constant when autopsy findings were included in the algorithm, 197.0 in 1970 and 191.4 in 1980 (p greater than 0.05). Adding creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB isoenzyme to the algorithm increased the rate of definite MIs from 209.0 in 1970 to 277.0 in 1980 (p less than 0.001). Interpretation of long-term trends in coronary heart disease morbidity is highly dependent upon variables used to validate cases. Care must be taken to maintain consistent criteria to avoid bias due to improvements in diagnostic techniques over time which increase sensitivity for detection of cardiac ischemia.\r"

A structured and systematic integration of information from different studies of a given problem with a view to answering the original question or bringing additional information is the essence and objective of the meta-analytic approach to health problem solving. Original studies in medicine, being very heterogeneous in nature and structure require not only a quantitative approach (as in classical meta-analysis) but also an additional \"qualitative meta-analysis\" as well. The latter represents not only a systematic accumulation of both information and the characteristics of different studies, but also an assessment of quality, uncertainty, missing data, random error and bias across studies of interest. The greatest challenge of meta-analysis in medicine lies in the integration of the qualitative and quantitative assessment of given information (scoring of quality, weighing of the effect size by quality score, etc.). Meta-analysis in medicine must go beyond a simple pooling of data. It should become the \"epidemiology of results of independent studies of a common topic of interest\". Further development of meta-analysis in such an expanded way may have an important impact on decision-making in clinical medicine, and in health policies.\r"

Ten patients were entered into the study, nine of whom were treated with 15 cycles of LAK cells (0.9 to 21.0 x 10(9) cells) and IL-2 (49 to 450 x 10(3) U/kg). The 10th patient in the study was not treated because of the onset of severe neurological deficits prior to beginning immunotherapy. Of the nine patients treated, one had a partial tumor response to immunotherapy as documented by computerized tomography. Neurological side effects occurred in all patients undergoing treatment and were related to increases in cerebral edema that appeared to be mediated by the immunotherapy. This report demonstrates the present limitations of regional adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells and IL-2 in the treatment of human glial tumors.\r"

Stereotaxic computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiographic data were obtained while the patient was positioned in an inverted custom stereotaxic head frame. The patients were then placed under general endotracheal anesthesia and positioned prone. Optimal trajectory planning utilized a transcerebellar route directed through the middle cerebellar peduncle, with target and entry points calculated to avoid vascular structures. No complications were encountered in the perioperative period when this technique was used. Histological diagnosis of the lesions revealed: astrocytomas in 14 patients, oligodendroglioma in one, ependymoma in one, arteriovenous malformations in two, radionecrosis in one, cryptococcal abscess in one, demyelinating disease in three, and infarctions in three. No consistent correlation could be made between radiographic characteristics and histological diagnoses. Empiric treatment of brain-stem lesions without tissue diagnosis based upon the radiological and clinical findings may result in inappropriate therapy administration. Alternatively, open operative procedures to obtain tissue require a visible surface abnormality to guide biopsy, and carry the risks of a major surgical procedure in already compromised patients. For these reasons the authors consider a suboccipital transcerebellar stereotaxic biopsy to be the diagnostic procedure of choice in the assessment of pontine mass lesions.\r"

This occurrence has caused the authors to reassess their experience with this procedure and review the published literature with regard to complications.

This article reviews current knowledge of the kinds and concentrations of carotenoids in human plasma (or serum) and solid tissues. Most reports have focused on the hydrocarbon carotenoids (lycopene, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene) with fewer dealing with the more polar xanthophyll pigments. The available literature indicates substantial interindividual heterogeneity with respect to blood levels of both total and individual carotenoids. Reports of solid tissue levels are few, but also indicate large variation, with adipose tissue and liver seemingly the major sites of deposition. The relationship between the types and concentrations of circulating carotenoids and those in solid tissues of the same individuals is not known, but preliminary investigations in our laboratory show considerable qualitative homology between the carotenoids in fasting serum and those in fatty tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Two pathways have been suggested for the conversion of carotenoids to vitamin A in mammals, central cleavage and excentric cleavage. An enzyme, beta-carotenoid-15,15'-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.21), has been partly purified from the intestines of several species and has been identified in several other organs and species. The enzyme, which converts beta-carotene into two molecules of retinal in good yield, requires molecular oxygen and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-binding and iron-binding reagents. Most provitamin A carotenoids, including the beta-apo-carotenals, are cleaved to retinal by this enzyme. Its maximal activity in the rabbit is approximately 200 times that required to meet nutritional needs but is less than 50% of that expected to produce signs of vitamin A toxicity. Excentric cleavage unquestionably occurs in plants and some microorganisms and might occur in mammals. Thus far, however, carotenoid dioxygenase with excentric bond specificity has been identified in mammals, the yield of beta-apo-carotenals from beta-carotene in vivo and in vitro is very low, and beta-apo-carotenals are formed nonbiologically from beta-carotene. To remain viable as an alternative pathway of vitamin A formation from carotenoids in mammals, the excentric cleavage hypothesis clearly requires unambiguous direct supporting evidence.\r"

  ".W": "There is growing evidence from in vitro and in vivo laboratory animal studies that beta-carotene can protect phagocytic cells from autooxidative damage, enhance T and B lymphocyte proliferative responses, stimulate effector T cell functions, and enhance macrophage, cytotoxic T cell and natural killer cell tumoricidal capacities, as well as increase the production of certain interleukins. Many of these effects have also been seen with carotenoids lacking provitamin A activity but having the antioxidant and singlet oxygen quenching capacities of beta-carotene. The association of immunoenhancement with decreased tumor burden in animals given carotenoids suggests a potential explanation for the epidemiological data linking lower carotenoid status with higher incidences of certain cancers. Since vitamin A is a relatively poor antioxidant and cannot quench singlet oxygen, beta-carotene may have more importance as a nutrient than simply serving as a precursor of vitamin A.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiologic evidence that carotenoids are involved in cancer etiology is evaluated. Low intake of vegetables and fruits and carotenoids is consistently associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, low levels of serum or plasma beta-carotene are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer. The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is indeed protective. Since retinol is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene seems to play a role that does not require its conversion into vitamin A. However, the importance of other carotenoids, other constituents of vegetables and fruits, and other nutrients whose levels in the blood are partially correlated with those of beta-carotene has not been adequately explored. In addition, smoking, a powerful risk factor for lung cancer, is associated with reduced intake of carotenoids and lowered blood levels of beta-carotene and has not always been adequately controlled in these analyses. Prospective and retrospective studies suggest that carotenoids may reduce the risk of certain other cancers; however, too few studies have looked at these sites to examine the consistency of the evidence. Although clinical trials of the efficacy of beta-carotene in cancer prevention are underway, it is still necessary and prudent to continue well-designed prospective and retrospective studies of the carotenoid hypothesis.\r"

Unfortunately, most animals used in research are \"white fat\" animals, and require large amounts of carotenoids in their diets to obtain significant blood and tissue levels. Even with these limitations, beta-carotene, a provitamin A carotenoid, as well as canthaxanthin, a non-provitamin A carotenoid, have been shown to protect animals against UV-induced skin tumors, UV and carcinogen-induced tumors, and carcinogen treatment alone. Similar observations have been made in cell and organ cultures where carotenoids have been shown to prevent malignant transformation and nuclear damage. Although the mechanism of this protection is still unclear, the evidence continues to accumulate that carotenoids may possess intrinsic chemopreventive action with respect to tumor formation.\r"

  ".W": "Retinoids are well established chemopreventive agents for experimental carcinogenesis of many target organs including mammary gland, urinary bladder, lung, skin, liver, pancreas, colon and esophagus. Modification of the basic retinoid structure has produced analogs with enhanced target organ specificity, increased inhibitory activity and reduced toxicity. N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) currently appears to be the most efficaceous retinoid against carcinogen-induced breast, urinary bladder, and lung cancer in rodents. Retinoids are most effective when administered shortly after the carcinogen treatment; however, the treatment can be delayed significantly while maintaining its chemopreventive effect. Under various experimental conditions, combining retinoid treatment with other modifiers of growth enhances its chemopreventive activity; for example, retinoid plus hormonal modulation can provide better protection against mammary cancer than either treatment alone. The role of carotenoids in cancer chemoprevention is less well defined. Studies have been complicated by the poor absorption and low tissue levels of carotenoids in the rodent models used for such studies. Aside from experimental skin carcinogenesis, little information is available relative to the effect of carotenoids on the chemoprevention of cancer at other organ sites.\r"

Attempts to use stable isotopes of minerals as metabolic tracers were first described only 25 years ago. There were relatively few reports of their use over the next 15 years, but interest in stable isotopes has expanded markedly in the last 10 years. The advantages of stable isotope tracers are so great that scientists have been willing to accept the laborious and costly nature of mineral isotope analysis, and substantial progress has been made in the field. New applications for stable isotopes and new analytical methods have been introduced recently. However, limitations to the approach and methodological problems remain to be resolved. This review describes early work in the field and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of stable isotope tracers and of the various methods of analysis. Information discovered with stable isotopes is reviewed, and probable future applications are discussed.\r"

Recent data from Indonesia, India, Thailand, Tanzania, Guatemala and elsewhere are reorienting concerns. Observational studies indicate that vitamin A--deficient children grow poorly, are more anemic, have more infections and are more likely to die than their peers, and that the magnitude of many of these consequences is directly related to the severity of the deficiency, even after adjusting for other variables. The few supplementation trials completed to date support these conclusions. Even after excluding children with frank deficiency at baseline, vitamin A-supplemented children have grown faster, developed higher hemoglobin values, and died less frequently (by 30-60%) than their nonsupplemented peers. The great surprise is not the central role vitamin A plays in each of these areas (McCollum and others recognized this long ago), but that this single nutrient can so profoundly affect children who are subject to multiple adverse influences.\r"

Kidneys were transplanted between nonimmunosuppressed outbred mongrel dogs and renal allograft function, renal eicosanoid production and histologic signs of rejection were monitored. In the untreated animals, renal allograft blood flow and allograft glomerular filtration rate declined steadily over the 5-day observation period compared to animals with nonrejecting autotransplanted kidneys. However, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate of renal allografts from animals receiving the selective thromboxane synthesis inhibitor CGS-12970 (3 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) were significantly higher compared to nontreated allograft animals. Histologic examination of renal allografts harvested 5 days after transplantation revealed rejection with mononuclear infiltration in both the untreated and the CGS-12970-treated animals. In untreated dogs, renal allograft tissue production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-Keto PG F1 alpha (6-K-PGF1 alpha) was significantly elevated 5 days after transplantation compared to normal renal tissue. In animals treated with CGS-12970, renal allograft tissue production of TXB2, PGE2 and 6-K-PGF1 alpha was significantly lower than the untreated allografts and was not different from normal kidneys. In-vitro dose-response experiments revealed that CGS-12970 nonselectively inhibited renal allograft tissue TXB2 and 6-K-PGF1 alpha production in a dose-dependent manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pellets were left in place to provide the release of morphine during critical phases of puberty and sexual maturation and to prevent an abrupt withdrawal syndrome upon pellet removal which would confound our results. Developing rats were sacrificed at representative intervals after pellet insertion to assess the development of key indices of reproductive endocrinology; adult rats were sacrificed at the same time intervals to permit an evaluation of age-related differences in the sensitivity to opiate-induced endocrine disturbances. Our results showed that morphine markedly influenced a number of endocrine parameters associated with the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in developing rats for prolonged periods of time, whereas the effects of the opiate in the adult rat were relatively modest and transient. In the developing rat, serum luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, the wet tissue weights of the seminal vesicles and testes and hypothalamic LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) levels were substantially depressed immediately after pellet implantation and these effects persisted for up to 4 weeks when compared to placebo-implanted, age-matched controls. In contrast to these results, adult rats showed only transient effects (less than 1 week) of morphine on certain reproductive endocrine parameters (e.g., serum LH, testosterone and the weights of the seminal vesicles) and no effects on others (e.g., testes weights and hypothalamic LHRH).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Slices of rat neocortex have been used to study the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the induction of epileptiform activity. The NMDA antagonist potency of a range of compounds with putative anticonvulsant activity has been compared with their ability to reduce epileptiform activity in this tissue. Epileptiform activity was induced by the omission of magnesium from the bathing medium. Competitive and noncompetitive phencyclidine-like NMDA antagonists reduced such spontaneous and stimulus-evoked epileptiform bursts and after potentials. Similar epileptiform activity induced by the addition of proconvulsant drugs, e.g. gamma-aminobutyric acidA antagonists, potassium channel blockers or carbachol was reduced by ketamine and/or D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. In magnesium-free medium, the frequency of spontaneous bursts and the number of afterpotentials per burst were reduced in parallel. There was a good correlation (r greater than 0.9) between their potencies against NMDA depolarizations and against epileptiform bursts (MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11- dihydro-5H-dibenzvo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine] greater than thienylcyclohexylpiperidine phencyclidine greater than 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid greater than cyclazocine greater than D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid greater than dextrorphan greater than SKF10,047 (N-allylnormetazocine) greater than ketamine greater than dextromethorphan = or greater than pentazocine). Sigma and dextromethorphan receptor ligands (e.g. ditolyguanidine, carbetapentane and phenytoin), whereas inactive as NMDA antagonists, reduced epileptiform activity by decreasing the number of afterpotentials per burst with less effect on the burst frequency. The quisqualate/kainate antagonist, FG9041 (6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione), only reduced spontaneous bursts at doses which also reduced NMDA. Our results imply a central role for NMDA receptors in epileptogenesis in neocortical slices.\r"

  ".W": "The down-regulation of beta adrenergic receptors by chronic imipramine treatment was investigated with high resolution autoradiography of [125I]pindolol binding to brain sections. Neuroanatomically selective down-regulation of [125I]pindolol binding was found after chronic imipramine treatment. Subdivisions of the amygdala and hippocampus and discrete cortical regions were differentially affected. In the hippocampus, reduction of [125I]pindolol binding was observed in imipramine-treated rats in the CA-1 stratum radiatum and dentate molecular layer, but not in the CA-3 stratum radiatum. In the amygdala, the basolateral nucleus exhibited reduced [125I]pindolol binding after imipramine treatment but the central and medial nuclei were not affected. Chronic imipramine treatment was also associated with reduced [125I]pindolol binding in layer 1 of the cingulate cortex and layer 3 of the piriform cortex. In contrast, no effect on [125I]pindolol binding was apparent in the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, caudate-putamen, lateral hypothalamus or layers 2 and 3 of the somatosensory cortex. In order to determine if regional variation in binding sites for imipramine, or its pharmacologically active metabolite desipramine, was responsible for the observed neuroanatomically selective reduction in [125I]pindolol binding, the binding of [3H]imipramine and [3H]desipramine was investigated. In some brain regions that exhibited high densities of [3H]imipramine and [3H]desipramine binding sites, [125I]pindolol binding was reduced after chronic treatment with imipramine. However, other regions that contained high densities of binding sites for antidepressant drugs did not show a reduction in [125I]pindolol binding after chronic imipramine treatment. Thus, regional binding of [3H]imipramine or [3H]desipramine cannot fully explain the neuroanatomical specificity of imipramine-induced beta adrenergic receptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these 8 patients 4 have functioning grafts 6 months to 7 years after transplant or reconstruction. Renal transplantation coupled with enterocystoplasty in properly selected patients has acceptable morbidity and should be considered as an alternative to other forms of urinary diversion in allograft recipients.\r"

Chlamydiae were detected by an immunofluorescence technique in the urethra of 1 patient (2 per cent) but they were not recovered in McCoy cell culture from the prostatic tissue of any patient nor were they detected in the tissue by immunofluorescence. In addition, serum antibody to Chlamydia trachomatis was not found even in moderate titer. The approach in this study has overcome the problem of urethral contamination in the assessment of prostatic specimens from patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis. There is no evidence that chlamydiae are directly implicated in the disease, although the possibility of an earlier active role cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Using a monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine and immunohistochemistry, we measured the incorporation of this thymidine analogue into the deoxyribonucleic acid of human prostate adenocarcinoma cells exposed in situ. Fifteen patients with prostate cancer were given an intravenous infusion of 500 mg. bromodeoxyuridine at needle biopsy to label tumor cells in the deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis phase (S phase). The tumor specimens were fixed with 70 per cent ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody as the first antibody. The results showed that this method demonstrated bromodeoxyuridine-labeled nuclei satisfactorily in tissue section. The bromodeoxyuridine labeling index, S phase fraction, was determined by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in the tissue sections. Grade 3 tumors averaged 4.37 +/- 0.48 per cent labeling versus 2.41 +/- 0.49 per cent in grade 2 tumors, and grade 1 tumor in the series had an S phase fraction of 1.36 +/- 0.39 per cent. The average S phase fractions for single gland, cribriform, fused and medullary were 1.16, 2.30, 3.74 and 4.95 per cent, respectively. The results obtained with S phase fraction measured with bromodeoxyuridine labeling proved to be comparable to the results of histological grade and growth pattern. Thus, the higher S phase fraction may indicate biological malignancy. Moreover, the degree of heterogeneity concerning S phase fraction distribution within prostate cancer tissue could be compared to the morphological appearance. Our preliminary results suggest that the measurement of bromodeoxyuridine labeling index in prostate cancer may prove to be a new objective and quantitative assay of biological potential of individual tumor.\r"

Features of furosemide-stimulated 99mTc-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid renographs were compared to the growth rate, thirst test and endogenous creatinine clearance rate in a chronic solitary-kidney animal model. Intravenous pyelograms, done four weeks after laparotomy, left nephrectomy, bladder resection and constriction of the right pyeloureteric junction, showed signs of obstruction in all the 12 animals of the experimental group. An absent tracer washout after intravenous furosemide, found in five animals, was associated with retarded growth, isosthenuria and an abnormal creatinine clearance. In all of the other seven animals, a distinct tracer washout after intravenous furosemide was accompanied with a normal growth rate and creatinine clearance. However, no one of these seven animals had a normal ability to retain water and concentrate urine in the thirst test. We conclude that, in this experimental model, a furosemide-induced tracer washout from the kidney pelvis cannot be taken as a proof of the absence of any upper urinary tract obstruction.\r"

Eleven patients had sinonasal complications; 8 had laryngotracheal complications; 4 had otologic complications; 2 had oropharyngeal complications; and 2 had a combination of more than one of the above complications. Of these otolaryngologic disorders, 63% were infectious in etiology. Development of otolaryngologic infections generally did not correlate with either higher doses of maintenance immunosuppression or with treatment of an acute rejection episode, which requires increased immunosuppression. Otolaryngologists should be aware of the sinonasal, laryngotracheal, oropharyngeal, and otologic disorders that can occur in cardiac transplant patients.\r"

Threshold shift was seen in 20% of the tested ears. Specific fluorescence was revealed around the modiolar vessels and in the basilar membrane. The endolymphatic sac and duct showed occasional fluorescence in the epithelial and/or subepithelial layers. The findings were discussed in light of the other models immunized with various forms of inner ear antigens.

We monitored their motor function with the use of standardized scales and determined the amount and quality of \"on\" and \"off\" time (the hours of the waking day when the antiparkinsonian medications were effective and ineffective, respectively). We found significant improvement in focal areas of motor function. The mean percentage of on time during the day increased from 47.6 percent to 75.0 percent (P = 0.012); the mean percentage of on time without chorea increased from 26.6 percent to 59.2 percent (P = 0.006); the mean severity of off time decreased as assessed by both the Activities of Daily Living subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale (P = 0.002) and the Schwab and England scale (P = 0.037). In contrast to the finding of Madrazo et al., however, the dosages of antiparkinsonian medications could not be decreased and postoperative morbidity was substantial. Despite cautious optimism, we conclude that the widespread use of this procedure outside of research centers is premature, since the improvement we found was slighter than in the previous cases.\r"

The common femoral and popliteal veins were evaluated for full compressibility (no thrombosis) and noncompressibility (thrombosis). Both veins were fully compressible in 142 of the 143 patients with normal venograms (specificity, 99 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 97 to 100). All 66 patients with proximal-vein thrombosis had noncompressible femoral veins, popliteal veins, or both (sensitivity, 100 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 95 to 100). For all patients (including 11 with calf-vein thrombi), sensitivity and specificity were 91 (95 percent confidence interval, 82 to 96) and 99 percent, respectively. The sensitivity for isolated calf-vein thrombosis was only 36 percent. The compression ultrasound test was repeated in a subset of 45 consecutive patients by a second examiner, unaware of the results of the first test, whose results agreed in all patients with those of the first examiner (kappa = 1). We conclude that ultrasonography with the single criterion of vein compressibility is a highly accurate, simple, objective, and reproducible noninvasive method for detecting proximal-vein thrombosis in outpatients with clinically suspected deep-venous thrombosis.\r"

Left ventricular mural thrombosis was observed by two-dimensional echocardiography on the 10th day after infarction in 10 of 95 patients (11 percent) in the high-dose group and in 28 of 88 patients (32 percent) in the low-dose group (P = 0.0004). One patient in the high-dose group and four in the low-dose group had nonhemorrhagic strokes (P = 0.17). One patient in the low-dose group had a fatal pulmonary embolism. There was no difference in the frequency of hemorrhagic complications, which occurred in six patients in the high-dose group and four in the low-dose group. The mean (+/- SEM) plasma heparin concentration was 0.18 +/- 0.017 U per milliliter in the high-dose group and 0.01 +/- 0.005 U per milliliter in the low-dose group (P less than 0.0001). In the high-dose group, the mean plasma heparin concentration was 0.10 +/- 0.029 U per milliliter among patients with abnormal two-dimensional echocardiograms, as compared with 0.19 +/- 0.019 U per milliliter among patients with normal echocardiograms (P = 0.01). We conclude that heparin administered subcutaneously in a dosage of 12,500 units every 12 hours to patients with acute anterior transmural myocardial infarction is more effective than a lower dosage (5000 units every 12 hours) in preventing left ventricular mural thrombosis.\r"

  ".U": "89112299\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 may affect renal hemodynamics in lupus nephritis, we examined the short-term effects of a selective thromboxane-receptor antagonist, BM 13,177, and of low-dose aspirin. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 10 patients with biopsy-proved lupus nephritis were given a 48-hour continuous infusion of BM 13,177 or placebo. At base line, seven patients had markedly elevated urinary levels of thromboxane B2, the breakdown product of thromboxane A2. During the infusion of BM 13,177, the inulin clearance rate, which was 68 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area at base line, increased by an average of 24 percent (range, 12 to 47 percent; P less than 0.01). Para-aminohippurate clearance was increased to the same extent, with no change in the filtration fraction. The bleeding time doubled, indicating an occupancy of platelet thromboxane receptors of more than 95 percent. The hemodynamic changes were associated with a significant increase in sodium excretion from 76 to 118 mmol per day (P less than 0.01) but with no change in arterial blood pressure. In another study, 10 additional patients with lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 20 mg of aspirin twice daily for four weeks. The aspirin regimen produced a selective, cumulative inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity and a doubling of bleeding time. However, there was no change in the inulin clearance rate and no change in urinary levels of thromboxane B2 or 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, which are indicators of renal synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, respectively. We conclude that in lupus nephritis, impairment of renal function is at least in part mediated hemodynamically and is reversible with a thromboxane antagonist. Platelets, however, are not a major source of thromboxane A2 synthesis and action within the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed age-specific national mortality data for the years 1981 through 1985 to evaluate changes in the location of death among the nation's elderly after implementation of Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS). Although it was unchanged in 1981 and 1982, the percentage of deaths occurring in the nation's nursing homes increased from 18.9 percent in 1982 to 21.5 percent in 1985. The increases in nursing home deaths were greatest between 1983 and 1984, when 33 states showed larger-than-expected increases when compared with a base period before implementation of PPS. These changes were accompanied by a decline in the percentage of deaths that occurred in hospitals. These changes in the location of death were most pronounced in the Midwest, South, and West; they were very small in the Northeast and in states not affected by the PPS. Furthermore, the states with high population enrollments in health maintenance organizations and with large declines in the mean hospital length of stay in 1984 showed the greatest shifts in the location of death. We conclude that Medicare's PPS resulted in the increased transfer of terminally ill patients from hospitals to nursing homes. Further study is required to determine whether such transfer is medically appropriate.\r"

There must be a national network for rapid dissemination or exchange of information among institutions regarding these lesions. The Study Group for the Complications of Perinatal Care (SGCPC), established in 1984 as an international, multicenter, multidisciplinary study group, is committed to the prevention of complications of perinatal care by individual and collective effort. Its individual members include perinatologists, neonatologists, pediatric pathologists, and obstetricians. There are institutional members as well. Activities to date include the development of a standardized perinatal autopsy protocol and the initiation of a uniform system for the categorization of perinatal deaths.

Two of the nonsurvivors died with complications related to clinical varicella. Of these 67 patients (65 survivors and two nonsurvivors who died of varicella-related causes), 51 patients were determined to be varicella susceptible. Clinical disease developed in no patients with serologic evidence or clinical history of varicella prior to transplantation. Eighteen susceptible patients were exposed and received zoster immune globulin and varicella did not develop. Clinical disease developed in eight patients despite zoster immune globulin, although one patient received it 96 hours after exposure. Six patients received no zoster immune globulin and clinical varicella developed. In all, varicella developed in 14 patients. Thirteen were admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous acyclovir. Of those treated, two died of causes related to complications of varicella. The remaining patients treated with acyclovir had mild disease. The one patient not treated with acyclovir also had mild disease. We conclude that patients contracting varicella after liver transplantation while receiving maintenance immunosuppressive agents should be treated with intravenous acyclovir. Generally, when treated with acyclovir while receiving maintenance immunosuppressive drugs, these patients have mild clinical disease. Patients recently treated with high-dose prednisone and cyclosporine may have severe clinical disease resulting in death.\r"

Children who failed the ELM screening were evaluated with the Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development (SICD) that was used as the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing language disorders. In the 12-month age and younger group, there was poor agreement between the ELM Scale and the SICD. For infants 13 to 24 months of age, there was moderately good agreement between the SICD and a second ELM that was administered 1 to 2 weeks after the initial screening. In the 25- to 36-month age group, there was excellent agreement between the SICD and a rescreen ELM. The agreement between the two instruments indicated that the rescreen ELM correctly classified 79% of the 13- to 24-month-old infants and 89% of the 25- to 36-month-old toddlers.\r"

Certain sensorimotor functions that might otherwise have returned are irreversibly lost because of this delayed response. An understanding of the pathophysiology behind this progressive, self-destructive sequence is yet to be acquired; however, numerous proposals have been set forth involving processes such as edema formation, vascular changes, an inflammatory reaction, and destruction of the neuronal plasma membranes. In this review, the authors outline many of the chemical, anatomic, and functional changes associated with SCI as well as a number of treatment regimens that have been found to improve recovery from SCI (including parenteral glucocorticoid therapy, localized cord cooling, calcium channel blockers, and opiate antagonism). From this, a number of mechanisms accounting for the mediation and/or prevention of the secondary destructive response are synthesized.\r"

As a result, of nine patients who are alive with improved neurologic functions, seven have been ambulatory for an average duration of 13 months. Of 19 patients who have already died, recurrence of neurologic deficits was observed in five (26%), and 14 had no neurologic deterioration until they succumbed to the malignancy.

Testing was done according to a randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial consisting of 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods with verapamil or propranolol or placebo. Patients underwent continuous 48-hour electrocardiographic monitoring before therapy (run-in phase) and during the last 2 days of each treatment period. A total of 391 episodes of diagnostic (greater than or equal to 0.15 mV) ST depression was recorded during the trial. Of these, 23 were symptomatic. None of the episodes occurred while the patients were asleep, 25% during exercise, 35% during minimal physical activity and 40% at rest. Rest included activities demanding mental arousal (conversation, reading or watching television). Heart rate at the onset of ST depression was higher (greater than or equal to 10 beats/min) than that observed in the 5 minutes preceding ischemia in 95% of the episodes. In the group as a whole, the average number of ischemic episodes per 24 hours was significantly reduced during propranolol therapy compared with placebo (0.7 +/- 0.6 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8; p less than 0.0005). No significant differences were seen during verapamil treatment (3.4 +/- 1.7 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8). It is concluded that transient myocardial ischemia in syndrome X is mostly precipitated by an increase in oxygen consumption, presumably due to a heightened sympathetic activity. Accordingly, beta blockers may represent the first line of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare complication of severe or malignant hypertension. When treated promptly it is potentially reversible without leaving long-term neurologic damage. It can be difficult to differentiate from cerebrovascular accidents or uremia. Acute elevations of intracranial pressure cause acute elevations of blood pressure--the Cushing reflex. This association is less clear for chronic elevations of intracranial pressure, which could occur with tumors. In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, there are usually diffuse neurologic signs, evidence of visual upset, variable alterations in conscious level, and often a history of rather gradual onset and more systemic symptoms beforehand. The optic fundi show the characteristic hemorrhages, exudates and papilledema, while the urine usually contains protein red cells and casts. Early treatment is mandatory but need not be by the parenteral route, and any blood pressure reduction should be gradual. Vigorous antihypertensive therapy under such circumstances can lead to problems with relative hypotension and underperfusion of vital organs such as the brain, the heart and the kidneys.\r"

Overzealous blood pressure lowering especially, and sometimes conservative blood pressure lowering, occasionally compromise the supply of blood to the brain to such an extent that neurological dysfunction or death results. Despite an awareness of this problem for more than a decade, the number of reports of such cases is increasing. An understanding of the problem requires detailed knowledge of both the pathophysiology of the cerebral circulation in hypertension and the cerebrovascular effects of antihypertensive drugs. If antihypertensive treatment, in particular emergency blood pressure lowering, is to always be safe, thought must be given to the cerebrovascular effects of the drugs to be used. This topic is discussed in relation to the observed (i.e., experimentally determined) and inferred (i.e., from clinical observation) effects of antihypertensive drugs and treatment on the cerebral circulation, especially with regard to autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.\r"

In the first study, the role played by the systolic, diastolic and systodiastolic components of hypertension in causing atherosclerotic damage of extracerebral and intracerebral arteries was examined. At the extracranial level, a significant correlation between systolic hypertension and atherosclerotic lesions was evident. The second study evaluated the risk of major stroke, myocardial infarction and death in patients with transient ischemic attacks and reversible ischemic neurologic deficits. Possible prognostic predictors of these events were thoroughly considered: Cumulative survival with the multivariate Kaplan-Meier analysis was significantly lower in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, particularly for cerebral deaths and for all deaths. The third study was aimed at assessing the risk factors for transient ischemic attacks and stroke in young adults. Again, hypertension emerged as a fundamental risk factor, significantly more frequent in the subgroup of older patients than in the younger subgroup.\r"

  ".U": "89116093\r", 
  ".W": "Autoregulation of the cerebral circulation is the regulating mechanism that keeps cerebral blood flow (CBF) constant within wide limits of arterial pressure. The lower limit is defined as the value of mean arterial pressure below which CBF decreases below the plateau, and the upper limit as the value of mean arterial pressure above which CBF increases above the plateau (60 and 150 mm Hg, respectively). Two possible mechanisms for autoregulation are discussed, myogenic response and metabolic regulation. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system modulate CBF autoregulation by shifting the entire curve toward higher or lower values of arterial pressure, respectively. The autoregulatory curve is shifted toward higher arterial pressures in chronic hypertension. Therefore, the tolerance to acute decreases in arterial pressure is impaired. Concomitantly, the tolerance of the brain to acute increases in arterial pressure is improved. This shift in the limits of autoregulation is due to structural and functional (hemodynamic) changes in the cerebral resistance vessels. These adaptive changes are partly reversible after chronic treatment with antihypertensive agents. The pathophysiology of autoregulation should be taken into consideration before drugs are used to decrease arterial pressure acutely.\r"

  ".U": "89116095\r", 
  ".W": "Hypertensive reactions occur frequently in the perioperative setting. Perioperative blood pressure elevation is generally amenable to treatment in previously normotensive patients. Alterations in cerebral autoregulation and myocardial performance in chronic hypertension limit the compensatory range available to cope with perioperative blood pressure changes. In cardiovascular or cerebrally compromised patients, the pathophysiology of underlying disease must therefore be taken into account. In the cerebrally compromised patient with space-occupying lesions and even merely locally impaired cerebral autoregulation, any blood pressure increase may reduce cerebral perfusion pressure and cause further cerebral impairment. Furthermore, vasodilation of cerebral vessels must be avoided to prevent further increase in intracranial pressure with reduction of cerebral perfusion. In chronically hypertensive patients, sufficient preoperative antihypertensive therapy is essential to avoid acute perioperative blood pressure elevation. Before antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy is begun, it is essential to rule out all correctable secondary causes of hypertension, particularly impairment of ventilation and oxygen supply. When pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy is necessary, vasodilators (e.g., calcium entry blockers) may be administered to chronically hypertensive patients. If elevated intracranial pressure is the underlying cause of hypertension, cerebral vasodilation must be avoided and only centrally acting antihypertensive agents such as urapidil should be used for management.\r"

Results from experiments with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) suggest that activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors in the medulla oblongata decreases the firing of serotoninergic neurons and thus reduces their excitatory input to the sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral cell column. As a consequence, blood pressure is reduced by 5-HT1A receptor agonists. Urapidil is an antihypertensive drug that has a dual mode of action: peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism and interaction with 5-HT1A receptors in the brain. This profile can adequately explain the vasodilation and lack of significant sympathetic activation observed during urapidil treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with neuropathologic processes leading to disturbed cerebrovascular autoregulation, sudden increases in arterial blood pressure may lead to a sudden elevation in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure. Therefore, sudden increases in arterial pressure should be assiduously avoided in the perioperative period. Hypertensive episodes may occur at any time during anesthesia, but are more likely to occur (1) during laryngoscopy and intubation, (2) at the time of skin incision, (3) at extubation, and (4) during awakening. In patients with cardiovascular disease, such hypertensive episodes may also cause deterioration of the cardiovascular situation. Catecholamines are the principal mediators of such intraoperative hypertensive reactions. There are 2 options available to the anesthesiologist: (1) attempt to suppress this response after it has occurred, or (2) prevent its occurrence at the outset. Treatment of hypertension often relies on agents that relax vascular smooth muscle. In patients with compromised intracranial compliance, however, cerebral vasodilation must be avoided because it leads to an increase in cerebral blood volume. This, in turn, may raise intracranial pressure and result either in herniation of brain contents or a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure leading to brain ischemia. Different pharmacologic means of preventing or suppressing such intraoperative hypertensive reactions are reviewed. Many of the drugs reviewed resulted in adverse effects that could preclude their use in patients with reduced intracranial compliance. Alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers can safely be administered to such patients.\r"

Neurologic dysfunction is prominent among the complications of increased arterial pressure and is also most susceptible to preventive antihypertensive therapy. The upward resetting of the limits of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in hypertension is probably due largely to structural thickening of the walls (hyaline arteriosclerosis) of the resistance vessels. Other consequences of hypertensive vascular lesions in the brain include increased formation of atheroma, lacunae and lacunar infarction, cerebral infarction, multi-infarct dementia and Binswanger's disease. There is also an association between hypertension and hemorrhagic strokes, namely, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain lesions are also prominent in malignant hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy. Antihypertensive treatment, especially if intensive, can result in boundary zone ischemia in the brain if arterial pressure decreases steeply.\r"

Various aspects of glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism were studied before and after approximately 10 weeks of prazosin treatment in 12 patients with mild hypertension. Prazosin was well tolerated and induced a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, without any change in body weight. Plasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acid, and lactate, which were measured hourly from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. following meals consumed at 8 A.M. and noon, did not change with prazosin treatment. However, the plasma insulin response from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) following prazosin treatment. In addition, fasting plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in prazosin-treated persons, as were postprandial triglyceride concentrations (p less than 0.001). Lower total plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were accounted for by decreases in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, whereas both high-density lipoprotein triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations increased following prazosin treatment. Finally, although both apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein B concentrations decreased in association with prazosin treatment, the decrease in apolipoprotein B was much greater in magnitude, leading to an increase in the ratio of apolipoprotein A1 to apolipoprotein B. In this study, treatment of mild hypertension with prazosin led to lower blood pressures and changes in insulin and lipoprotein metabolism that are important in this patient population.\r"

Results showed that hydrochlorothiazide and prazosin lowered blood pressure effectively in both black and white patients, but there was a trend for more patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide to need combination therapy than for those receiving prazosin, regardless of ethnic status. Prazosin therapy reduced total cholesterol levels by 20.5 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 19.0 mg/dl, and hydrochlorothiazide increased total cholesterol levels by 11.4 mg/dl and increased low-density lipoprotein levels by 9.3 mg/dl; but no differences in triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, plasma high-density lipoprotein2, or high-density lipoprotein3 levels were noted.

Total plasma cholesterol decreased by 9 percent during prazosin treatment and increased by 7 percent during propranolol treatment (p less than 0.005 between treatments). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 12 percent with prazosin and increased by 12 percent with propranolol (p less than 0.005). Apolipoprotein B decreased by 17 percent with prazosin and increased by 15 percent with propranolol (p less than 0.005). There were no significant changes in total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, its subfractions high-density lipoprotein2 or high-density lipoprotein3, or in apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein A2. Plasma very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein triglycerides were not significantly affected by either treatment. Plasma post-heparin lipase activities, which clear triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from plasma, were not altered significantly. Since regional blood flow could affect the clearance of plasma lipoproteins, measurements were taken of forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and maximal forearm vasodilatory potential during reactive hyperemia. The adrenergic antagonists had no effect on these measurements, nor did they affect cellular cholesterol synthesis as measured by the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in blood mononuclear cells. The results of this study demonstrate differing actions between alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonism. Alpha-blockade produced significantly lower levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B than beta-adrenergic antagonism without changes in high-density lipoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids could benefit patients with Raynaud's phenomenon because, among other effects, these fatty acids induce a favorable vascular response to ischemia. The aim of our study was to investigate, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner, the effects of fish-oil fatty-acid dietary therapy in patients with rheumatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon were randomly assigned to olive-oil placebo or fish-oil groups. Patients ingested 12 fish-oil capsules daily containing a total of 3.96 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.64 g docosahexaenoic acid or 12 olive-oil capsules and were evaluated at baseline and after six, 12, and 17 weeks. All patients ingested olive oil between Weeks 12 to 17. Digital systolic blood pressures and blood flow were measured at room air and water baths of 40 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 10 degrees C using strain gauge plethysmography. Onset of Raynaud's phenomenon was timed with a stop watch and defined as plethysmographic evidence of cessation of blood flow and blood pressure in the study finger. RESULTS: In the fish-oil group, the median time interval before the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon increased from 31.3 +/- 1.3 minutes baseline to 46.5 +/- 2.1 minutes at six weeks (p = 0.04). Patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon ingesting fish oil had the greatest increase in the time interval before the onset of the condition. Five of 11 patients (45.5 percent) with primary Raynaud's phenomenon ingesting fish oil in whom the phenomenon was induced at baseline could not be induced to develop Raynaud's at the six- or 12-week visit compared with one of nine patients (11 percent) with primary Raynaud's ingesting olive oil (p = 0.05). The mean digital systolic pressures were higher in the patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon ingesting fish oil than in patients with primary Raynaud's ingesting olive oil in the 10 degrees C water bath (+32 mm Hg, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ingestion of fish oil improves tolerance to cold exposure and delays the onset of vasospasm in patients with primary, but not secondary, Raynaud's phenomenon. These improvements are associated with significantly increased digital systolic blood pressures in cold temperatures.\r"

The purpose of our study was to compare patients with chronic fatigue who believed they had the yeast connection to patients with chronic fatigue without the yeast connection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with a chief complaint of chronic fatigue were evaluated in a specialty clinic setting at the University of Connecticut Health Center. A complete history was obtained from each patient, and a 168-item review of systems and a complete physical examination were performed. RESULTS: Eight patients believed that their fatigue was due to chronic candidiasis. Of these eight, seven had psychiatric diagnoses that were judged to underlie their fatigue. Of the remaining 92 patients with chronic fatigue, 59 had underlying psychiatric diagnoses. We were unable to find historical, physical, or laboratory differences between chronic fatigue patients with or without the yeast connection. CONCLUSION: From this study and a review of the literature, we are unable to identify findings that are specific for the yeast connection.\r"

Several renal transplant recipients at our medical center have developed M. chelonae infections during the past several years, so we decided to review our recent experience with M. chelonae infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical microbiology laboratory records of four Vanderbilt University Affiliated Hospitals were reviewed. Ten patients with M. chelonae tissue or blood infections were identified between 1982 and July 1988. RESULTS: All infections involved the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Three infections developed at the sites of medical injections. The remaining seven infections occurred in renal transplant recipients and produced a clinically distinctive syndrome. All were indolent tender nodular lesions on the extremities, usually the lower legs. Systemic symptoms were absent, and white blood cell counts were within normal limits. Diagnosis required tissue biopsy and cultures that were incubated for a month. Therapy consisted of surgical excision combined with long-term antibiotics. Even so, some patients had a chronic, relapsing course. CONCLUSION: Although other diagnoses must be considered, the presumptive diagnosis of M. chelonae infection is suggested by the appearance of nodular erythematous lesions on the legs of a renal transplant recipient.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The expansion of an abnormal hemopoietic stem cell line is responsible for the myelodysplastic syndromes, which are characterized by pancytopenias, often resulting in lethal infections. Cloned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was recently shown to enhance the growth and differentiation of normal granulocyte progenitor cells in vitro. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of recombinant human G-CSF in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and one patient with smoldering acute myelogenous leukemia following the occurrence of a myelodysplastic syndrome received recombinant human G-CSF by intravenous infusion for six days. Patients received different dosage levels (50 to 1,600 micrograms/m2). RESULTS: A response was seen in all patients, with an increase in both immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood. The dose levels that could stimulate granulocytopoiesis differed among patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, at least in some cases of myelodysplastic syndromes, granulocytopenia can be improved by G-CSF, although it still remains to be determined whether the increase in the number of granulocytes is due to the differentiation and maturation of the myelodysplastic clone or restoration of a residual normal clone.\r"

The majority of deaths are attributable to the genus Amanita. Amanita phalloides (death cap) has been found with increasing frequency across the United States and presents a significant health hazard in this country to those who pick and consume wild mushrooms. This article discusses the pharmacologic basis and clinical manifestations of Amanita intoxication. It outlines the rationale of various treatment modalities and, from these, summarizes a protocol that the authors believe will be useful to the clinician. In addition, two patients are presented who underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure secondary to Amanita poisoning. The role of liver transplantation both acutely and as treatment for chronic active hepatitis secondary to severe intoxication is discussed.\r"

This treatment was used in the past as a salvage therapy for patients with end-stage cancers. Occasional cures in patients with chemotherapy-responsive malignancies encouraged oncologists to utilize this treatment earlier when a better result might be achieved. This has led to a substantial number of long-term disease-free survivors in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute leukemia, and neuroblastoma. Studies are currently ongoing in the treatment of breast cancer, multiple myeloma, testicular cancer, and ovarian cancer. Important areas for future investigation include the identification of optimal criteria for patient selection and timing of the therapy, the need for infusion of hematopoietic stem cells as cloned hematopoietic growth factors become available, the identification of the most effective high-dose regimens, and the need for \"purging\" tumor cells from the marrow before re-infusion. Successfully addressing these issues will increasingly require large comparative trials.\r"

The disruption in Descemet's membrane began just above the inferior, crescent-shaped area of stromal thinning. Therapeutic modalities initially included hypertonic solution to determine whether corneal edema would resolve spontaneously, apparently by endothelial migration with healing over the break in Descemet's membrane. One patient required thermokeratoplasty and another penetrating keratoplasty for persistent stromal edema. Acute hydrops can occur with pellucid marginal corneal degeneration by a pathogenesis similar to other noninflammatory corneal thinning disorders such as keratoconus.\r"

TNF mRNA in endotoxin-treated rats as quantitated by densitometry of the ratio of TNF mRNA to actin mRNA in Northern blots was present in increased quantity in the liver, kidney, and lung (1.6-2.9 times over time zero levels) at 15 minutes and increased quantity in the spleen, liver, and kidney (1.3-1.9 times over time zero levels) at 30 minutes. The kinetics of endotoxin-induced TNF gene expression are consistent with the relatively transient peak of serum TNF protein levels reported by previous investigators to occur approximately 1 hour after injection of endotoxin. Because TNF mRNA appeared ubiquitous in the organs of control rats examined and because the endotoxin-induced increase in TNF mRNA was relatively small, endotoxin may induce the expression of the TNF protein in serum not only by increasing TNF mRNA levels but perhaps more importantly by a posttranscriptional mechanism. The presence of a preformed pool of TNF mRNA may teleologically be viewed as a mechanism to increase the rapidity of the host's response to sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The differentiation potential of the human retinoblastoma cell lines Y-79 and WERI-Rb1 was evaluated in vitro for up to 120 days in a matrix system and in rotary suspension for 30 days. Matrix cultures were grown with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), with and without differentiation-promoting agents. The latter were applied for a total of 5-45 days (usually 30 days) and included 7S nerve growth factor, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium butyrate, retinoic acid, hydrocortisone, and ascorbic acid. Fully defined, serum-free medium and medium containing 5 or 15% FCS were also used for matrix cultures, and medium with 5 or 10% FCS for suspension cultures. By immunoperoxidase (performed on matrix cultures, both untreated and treated for 30 days with differentiation-promoting agents), the cells of both lines were positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), class III beta-tubulin (human h beta 4) isotype, and synaptophysin. In addition, the WERI-Rb1 cells expressed 200 kd neurofilament protein (NFP-H) and retinal S-antigen. Both lines were invariably negative for glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, myelin basic protein, the epitope recognized by the Leu-7 monoclonal antibody, opsin, and hydroxy-indole-O-methyltransferase. In the Y-79 line the presence of NSE and the absence of NF proteins-H, -M and -L, of GFA protein, and of retinal S-antigen were confirmed biochemically. No differentiated features were found by electron microscopy in either line. Thus, in the matrix system employed, both lines exhibited solely a potential for neuroblastic differentiation, which was more advanced in the WERI-Rb1 line, as reflected by the antigenic expression of NFP-H and of retinal S-antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Monokines may contribute to the regulation of hematopoiesis and circulating numbers of leukocytes during chronic inflammation. The hematologic effects of daily intravenous injection of the recombinant monokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were therefore studied in the bone marrow and circulation of rats over the course of a week. TNF induced daily neutrophilia and lymphopenia with no evidence of tachyphylaxis. TNF also induced a slight decrease in early myeloid forms in the marrow, but, more strikingly, induced a marked erythroid hyperplasia of late normoblasts, although no changes other than a slight reticulocytosis were noted in the peripheral red blood cell compartment. IL-1 also induced daily neutrophilia and lymphopenia with no evidence of tachyphylaxis. IL-1 differed from TNF in the induction of a significant myeloid hyperplasia and in the lack of any effect on the erythroid elements of the marrow. The lack of tachyphylaxis to the chronic administration of both TNF and IL-1 suggests that the mechanism of endotoxin-induced tachyphylaxis is not at the level of the effector cell response to these endogenous cytokines. G-CSF induced a biphasic peripheral neutrophilia first peaking on day one, reaching a nadir on day 4, and then rising progressively again until day 7. The low level of neutrophilia on day 4 is not due to marrow depletion of neutrophils secondary to the neutrophil releasing activity of G-CSF because the marrows of G-CSF-treated rats on both days 3 and 7 contained over twice the number of mature neutrophils as controls. Thus, the trough in the neutrophilia induced by G-CSF is postulated to be due to an as-yet unidentified negative feedback mechanism that inhibits neutrophil release from the marrow.\r"

Previous reports on the expression of the Hodgkin's cell-associated antigen Ki-1, CD30, on normal cells have been limited to activated lymphocytes. This study demonstrates, however, that cells of the macrophage lineage also are able to express the Ki-1 antigen. The Ki-1 antigen is absent from normal blood monocytes but expressed on up to 85% of macrophage-type cells developed during subsequent in vitro differentiation on Teflon membranes. Unlike other maturation-associated antigens, Ki-1 is found only at late stages of the macrophage primary cultures. Its expression can be enhanced by human interferon-gamma in a fashion similar to that of HLA-DR molecules. In addition, freshly explanted tumor cells from three patients with histopathologic and clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of true histiocytic lymphoma or malignant histiocytosis as well as the permanent cell line SU-DHL-1 could be demonstrated to express the Ki-1 antigen. The phenotype of histiocytic malignancy was further evaluated to be HLA-DR+MAX.26+CD25+-EMA+OKT9+Ki-1+. The results could indicate either that Hodgkin's lymphoma may arise not only from the lymphocyte but also from the macrophage lineage or may emphasize a macrophage involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

In three reactive cases up to 30% of follicle center cells also were stained. In contrast, more than 50% of neoplastic follicle center cells were stained by MT2 in 27 of 62 cases of CB/CC, and light chain restriction was shown in 52 of 62 cases. MT2 staining and/or light chain restriction was seen in 57 of 62 cases. In 106 further cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, MT2 was positive in 59 of 77 B cell lymphomas and 3 of 29 T cell lymphomas.

The break sites in DNA were translated artificially in the presence of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and [3H]-labeled dTTP. Autoradiographic observation was made of the level of break sites in the DNA. The DNA strand break appeared even with a 3 Gy exposure, increased 8.6 times at 24 Gy compared with the control cells, and this level correlated reciprocally to change in cell viability. This nick translation method provides a rapid in situ assay for determining radiation-induced DNA damage of cultured cells, in a semi-quantitative manner.\r"

In the present study the responses of the arterial pressure waveform to mechanical ventilation with and without synchronized external chest compression (SEC) in the presence of acute ventricular failure (AVF) were evaluated by measuring the systolic pressure variation (SPV). SPV, the difference between the maximal and minimal values of systolic blood during a single positive pressure breath, consists of delta up and delta down components when systolic blood pressure during a short apnea is used as reference value. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) alone, AVF caused SPV to decrease significantly from 8.8 +/- 4.0 to 5.7 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, and further to 3.1 +/- 1.1 mm Hg after volume loading (P less than 0.02). The decrease in SPV was due to a significant decrease in the delta down component, whereas the delta up became the major component of the reduced SPV. The application of SEC caused significant increases in the delta down, delta up, and overall SPV during AVF without volume loading. However, during AVF with volume loading, SEC increased only the delta up component of the SPV, signifying a transient increase in the left ventricular stroke output. It is concluded that the disappearance of the delta down component of the SPV is characteristic of congestive heart failure. Analysis of the arterial waveform offers a readily available monitoring tool for the differentiation of the possible effects on increased intrathoracic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Renewed interest in i.v. anesthetic techniques has resulted from the availability of more rapid and shorter-acting i.v. drugs. With recent advances in the area of infusion pump technology, it has become easier to administer i.v. anesthetics and analgesics by continuous infusion techniques. The newer sedative-hypnotic (midazolam, propofol) and analgesic (sufentanil, alfentanil) drugs are better suited pharmacologically to continuous administration techniques than the traditional i.v. agents because they can be more accurately titrated to meet the unique and changing anesthetic needs of the individual patient. With the newer sedative and analgesic drugs, it is now possible to administer i.v. anesthetics in a titrated manner analogous to that which is possible when volatile anesthetics are used. In this way, the drug infusion rate is varied depending on the patient's responses to noxious surgical stimuli. In titrating i.v. drug infusions, consideration must also be given to the age of the patient, pre-existing disease states, potential drug interactions, and proximity to the end of the operative procedure. The availability of rapid and short-acting i.v. drugs like alfentanil and propofol, as well as intermediate-acting muscle relaxants makes it possible to employ total intravenous anesthetic techniques during general surgery. Many non-sedative and non-analgesic i.v. drugs are being investigated in anesthesia for use by continuous infusion techniques, e.g., muscle relaxant, and local anesthetics. Several recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetics for obstetrical analgesia. The use of continuous local anesthetic infusions makes it possible to achieve improved analgesia (i.e., a more constant degree of analgesia) with lower doses. Improved delivery systems for administering i.v. drugs will make it easier to use continuous infusion techniques in the future. With continued progress in the development of infusion devices and i.v. drugs designed for continuous administration, the use of intravenous anesthetic techniques will become more widespread. In the near future, infusion pumps will likely become standard equipment on all anesthesia machines and anesthesiologists should find these techniques easier to use in their clinical practices.\r"

Except for administration of the primary anesthetic, anesthesia management was standardized for all patients. The randomized groups did not differ in demographic characteristics, extent of coronary artery disease, chronic antianginal therapy, hemodynamic characteristics including new myocardial ischemia at arrival to the operating room, and surgical characteristics that might influence the rate of postoperative myocardial infarction or death. From anesthetic induction to start of cardiopulmonary bypass, new ST segment depression appeared in 310 (30.4%) patients and was not different among primary anesthetic groups (28.0-33.5%). Similarly, the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (3.6-4.7%) and death (1.2-2.4%) was not different. Although intraoperative hypotension was twice as common in patients receiving any volatile anesthetic and hypertension twice as common with sufentanil, tachycardia (greater than or equal to 110 bpm) was not related to any primary anesthetic (4.3-9.1%) and was the only hemodynamic abnormality significantly related to intraoperative ischemia. The strongest predictor of intraoperative ischemia was ischemia on arrival to the operating room. The authors postulate that approximately 90% of new myocardial ischemia observed during anesthesia is the manifestation of silent ischemia observed in patients before operation and only 10% is related to anesthetic management. They conclude that, despite differences in the hemodynamic consequences of the primary anesthetics studied, none of the primary anesthetics influenced outcome and the primary role of the anesthesiologist in management of these patients is control of heart rate.\r"

Latencies and amplitudes of the resulting potentials at each level were compared with postinduction control values. With increasing MAC, latency and amplitude changes seen at C6 (subcortical) were also compared with those at SC (cortical). Increasing the concentrations of each agent resulted in a graded increase in latency and a graded decrease in amplitude, at all levels. At SC each increase in MAC with each agent resulted in an increase in latency (P less than 0.05) and a decrease in amplitude (P less than 0.005), respectively. The increases in SC latency at 0.75, 1 MAC were larger than the increase in latency at C-6 (P less than 0.005) and the decreases in SC amplitudes at 0.5, 0.75 and 1 MAC were greater than the decrease in amplitude at C-6 (P less than 0.01). Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane in 60% N2O altered subcortical potentials less than cortical potentials. Enflurane and isoflurane at 0.5, 0.75, and 1 MAC, and halothane at 0.5, 0.75 MAC maintained subcortical and cortical potentials that were adequate for evaluation. However, 1 MAC of halothane suppressed cortical potentials but maintained subcortical potentials. Subcortical C-6 potential may serve as an additional monitor.\r"

Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured from the peroneal nerve, calf blood flow, forearm venous plasma catecholamines, blood pressure, heart rate, airway pressure, and end-tidal CO2 (%) during spontaneous breathing and during mechanical ventilation with 0-20 cmH2O PEEP. MSNA increased (P less than 0.01) during PEEP ventilation, from 22 bursts.min-1 at spontaneous breathing to 39 bursts.min-1 at 20 PEEP. This increase in MSNA was accompanied by an increase (P less than 0.01) in calf vascular resistance (CVR) from 35 PRU100 at spontaneous breathing to 48 PRU100 at 15 PEEP with no further increase at 20 PEEP. Venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) during PEEP ventilation from 0.19 ng.ml-1 at spontaneous breathing to 0.31 ng.ml-1 at 20 PEEP, whereas plasma epinephrine and dopamine were less than 0.03 ng.ml-1 during the experiment. Blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by PEEP ventilation except at 20 PEEP, where blood pressure and heart rate increased (P less than 0.01). The results show that PEEP ventilation induces a considerable reflex increase of MSNA, reflected also by an increase in CVR and venous plasma norepinephrine. It is proposed that the main mechanism responsible for these reflex adjustments is caused by a decreased activity of the cardiopulmonary low-pressure baroreceptors, in turn resulting from a decrease in cardiac transmural pressures due to PEEP ventilation.\r"

One hundred and fifty children, ASA physical status I or II, ages 2-15 yr, were studied. Each child was randomly assigned to receive either droperidol, 0.075 mg/kg; lidocaine, 1.5 mg/kg; or a combination of lidocaine, 1.5 mg/kg, and a reduced dose of droperidol, 0.025 mg/kg, immediately after induction of anesthesia, which was with thiopental, atropine, and succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide. The incidence of postanesthetic vomiting was 22% in the droperidol-alone group, which was significantly less than the lidocaine-alone group (50%). The incidence of vomiting in the combination group (30%) was not significantly different from either the droperidol- or lidocaine-alone groups. The time in the recovery room was significantly shorter for patients given lidocaine alone than those given droperidol alone or the combination. However, the mean time intervals from completion of surgery to recovery of full alertness and to discharge from the hospital did not differ significantly among the three groups. In summary, the authors found that intravenous droperidol is significantly more effective than lidocaine in reducing the incidence of vomiting in unpremedicated children after strabismus surgery. Furthermore, droperidol did not delay either the time to recovery of full alertness or the time to discharge from hospital compared to lidocaine.\r"

To verify whether this disparity occurs in patients with severe lung injury, the authors simultaneously measured both PAOP and LVEDP at 0, 10, and 16-20 cm H2O PEEP in 12 supine patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In all patients, the radiographic location of the PA catheter tip was at or below the level of the posterior border of the left atrium. A close correlation was found between PAOP and LVEDP at each level of PEEP. In only six of 35 simultaneous measurements was the PAOP-LVEDP gradient 2 mmHg or more (2-3 mmHg in four, and 4 mmHg in two). In five patients, the highest PEEP level was 4-9 cm H2O greater than LVEDP; however, no gradient was measured between LVEDP and PAOP. The authors conclude that, in severe ARDS, a close correspondence between PAOP and LVEDP is maintained despite applying PEEP levels up to 20 cm H2O, suggesting that, in ARDS, surrounding pathology prevents transmitted alveolar pressure from collapsing adjacent pulmonary vessels.\r"

  ".W": "We have achieved repeated success with unilateral lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis and have developed an en bloc, double-lung transplant procedure for patients with advanced lung disease of an obstructive or infective nature. Six such procedures have now been performed for end-stage emphysema, and all recipients are alive and well 5 to 15 months later. A seventh transplant for primary pulmonary hypertension was unsuccessful. All recipients were judged to have a life expectancy of 12 to 18 months on the basis of the degree of disability and the documented rate of disease progression. We feel the double-lung procedure is more appropriate than the combined heart-lung transplant for patients requiring replacement of both lungs when right heart function is adequate or deemed recoverable. With this procedure, the recipient is able to retain his or her own heart, avoiding the liabilities associated with cardiac transplantation. Furthermore, the donor heart is available for a separate recipient, and this sharing of the heart and lungs greatly increases the supply of transplantable lungs for patients with end-stage lung disease. Ischemia of the donor airway has been a source of complication, including the one death to date, but this appears to be a surmountable problem.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we studied the applicability of a random walk model of individual cell motility in predicting the motile behavior of alveolar macrophage populations under agarose. The migration of a population of cells in the absence of a chemotactic or chemokinetic gradient can be characterized by the random motility coefficient, mu, which is analogous to a particle diffusion coefficient. Random walk theory relates this latter coefficient to particle speed and collision time (equivalent to the time between changes in particle direction). By analogy, according to a similar random walk theory for cell migration, mu for a cell population is a function of the speed and persistence time (with direction changes governed by cell behavioral processes rather than by collisions) of individual cells. To test the model, normal guinea pig alveolar macrophages were incubated in the presence or absence of uniform concentrations of the chemotactic tripeptide formyl-norleucyl leucyl phenylalanine (FNLLP) to elicit different levels of motile activity. Mu was calculated from cell population density profiles obtained by fixing and staining cultures after 2, 3, or 4 days. In parallel experiments, individual cell speeds and persistence times were measured from 1-h, time-lapse video microscopy recordings. The value of mu calculated from single-cell measurements was in good agreement with that from population studies for stimulated random migration (at 10(-7) to 10(-11) M FNLLP), but not in the absence of stimulant. Overall, these results support the applicability of the random walk model of individual cell migration to randomly migrating alveolar macrophage populations.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution and degree of expression of Class I and Class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens on human lower respiratory tract epithelium were evaluated in five freshly obtained pneumonectomy and lobectomy specimens using an immunoperoxidase technique. Multiple sites were examined from each specimen, and two independent observers graded each sample as positive, equivocal, or negative compared with control slides. Interobserver agreement was high. From a total of 120 grade determinations, 114 showed complete concordance and only one showed a positive/negative discordance. Both Class I (HLA-A,B,C) and Class II (HLA-DR) antigens were uniformly and strongly expressed throughout the major, lobar, and segmental bronchi of each sample, the bronchiolar epithelium, and the alveolar epithelium. Paired samples of adjacent lower respiratory tract epithelium harvested with the fiberoptic bronchoscope and during pathologic examination, respectively, revealed an identical staining pattern for these antigens. Staining for HLA-DQ expression (a subset of MHC Class II antigens) was generally weaker and appeared more variable, with four negative, six equivocal, and 30 positive samples. Our observations demonstrate the widespread expression of Class I antigens on airway epithelium and reveal for the first time the ubiquitous nature of Class II MHC antigen (HLA-DR) expression throughout the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, they attest to the adequacy of bronchoscopically obtained samples for immunologic staining. These results provide a basis for both a putative mechanism of bronchocentric rejection phenomena after human heart-lung transplantation and for the means to monitor it prospectively.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of specific keratin intermediate filaments during differentiation of rat type II pneumocytes in primary culture on various matrices was investigated. Changes in keratin expression were assessed using a monoclonal antikeratin antibody, 24A3, known to react strongly with alveolar epithelial cells in injured lung. Type II cell differentiation was modulated by culture on extracellular matrices known to either accelerate or retard loss of differentiated morphology and metabolic function. During culture on a plastic or fibronectin-rich surface, loss of cell differentiation correlates with increased staining with 24A3 antikeratin antibody by indirect immunofluorescence and with increased abundance of a family of acidic 46,000-dalton keratin isoforms detected in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels of type II cell cytoskeletal extracts. Loss of type II cell differentiation is retarded or prevented by culture on substrata of purified laminin or of EHS tumor-derived basement membrane (matrigel). 24A3-linked fluorescence and expression of the 46 kDa keratins are reduced in parallel, although at 7 days in culture on matrigel or laminin, keratin expression increases. The results show that changes in type II cell differentiation effected in primary culture by the extracellular matrix correlates with changes in expression of the 24A3-reactive keratins. Loss of differentiated shape and function favors expression of these cytoskeletal antigens, which may provide quantifiable markers of the type II to type I cell transition that occurs during alveolar remodeling.\r"

To investigate whether they also have a role in antigen-induced lung inflammation, we have studied the changes in lung solute clearance (LSC) in sensitized rats after aerosol challenge with allergen and the effect of prior capsaicin-induced denervation on these changes. Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized with egg albumin (EA), using aluminum hydroxide and Bordetella pertussis as adjuvants. After 11 days, the animals were challenged for 5 min with aerosolized EA, and the clearance from the lungs of aerosolized 99mTc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) over 7.5 min (LSC 7.5) was subsequently measured at various times after challenge as an index of epithelial permeability or integrity. Sensitized animals responded to the challenge with immediate respiratory symptoms and with an increased 99mTc-DTPA clearance rate that was detectable at 20 min (mean +/- SE LSC 7.5: baseline, 6 +/- 1%; 20 min, 17 +/- 3%; p less than 0.05), persisted at 4 h (14 +/- 1%; p less than 0.05), and returned to normal values after 24 h. Unsensitized rats exposed to EA and sensitized rats exposed to PBS or to bovine serum albumin did not show any change. Bronchoalveolar lavage failed to show significant changes of cell populations until 24 h, when an increased presence of lymphocytes, PMN, and eosinophils was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In normal humans in vivo, maximal airway narrowing to LTD4 is more severe than to methacholine. Moreover, LTD4 heightens the maximal response to methacholine for several days. To investigate whether or not this is due to inflammatory changes in the airway wall, we studied the effects of the corticosteroid budesonide on the dose-response curves to inhaled LTD4 and to methacholine. In a two-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, budesonide (400 micrograms twice a day) or placebo was inhaled by eight normal subjects on six consecutive days, with a 3-wk washout. Complete dose-response curves to LTD4 (0.36 to 43 nmol) were performed on Day 5, and to methacholine (1.28 to 655 mumol) on Days 4 and 6 of each period using a validated method. The response was measured by FEV1 and standardized partial expiratory flow-volume curves (V40p), and was expressed as the percent fall from baseline. A maximal response plateau was considered if more than two doses fell within a 5% response range. All subjects reached plateaus to methacholine and to LTD4. Budesonide reduced the maximal response to LTD4 (mean difference with placebo, 7.9% fall for FEV1, and 8.4% fall for V40p; p less than 0.05). During placebo the maximal response to methacholine 24 h after LTD4 was higher than 24 h before (mean change, 2.7% fall in FEV1 and 5.5% fall in V40p; p less than 0.05), but not during budesonide (mean change, -2.5% fall in FEV1 and -0.1% fall in V40p; p greater than 0.2), the changes being significantly different between the two periods (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both inhaled pirenzepine (70 micrograms) and ipratropium bromide (7 micrograms) significantly inhibited vagally mediated bronchoconstriction by SO2 to the same extent (p less than 0.02). However, at this dose, pirenzepine had no effect on methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, whereas ipratropium bromide gave significant protection (p less than 0.02). This indicates that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction in humans can be inhibited by blockade of pirenzepine-sensitive (M1) muscarinic receptors probably present on a different site from muscarinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction and presumably localized to parasympathetic ganglia. Pirenzepine may be useful in investigating ganglionic function and could be beneficial therapeutically in airway disease.\r"

There were no significant differences in prechallenge prostanoid levels between the four groups, with the potentially bronchoprotective mediators present in highest concentration. Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases (p less than 0.05) in PGD2 (97.4 +/- 19.4 to 1,053.2 +/- 338.6 pg/ml, mean +/- SEM) and TX (45.5 +/- 7.5 to 150.7 +/- 37.8 pg/ml) over prechallenge levels and control groups. Similarly, histamine increased in the atopic asthmatics after challenge (0.36 +/- 0.22 to 6.84 +/- 1.86 ng/ml; p less than 0.05). Atopic nonasthmatics had slight increases in PGD2 (96.9 +/- 25.4 to 219.7 +/- 47.5 pg/ml; p greater than 0.1) after challenge, whereas PGD2 and TX did not change in nonatopic subjects. A significant positive correlation was found between histamine, PGD2, and TX levels after challenge among all groups (p less than 0.001).

Sustained-release theophylline (THEO) may be superior to conventional inhaled bronchodilators in preventing nocturnal asthma symptoms and the early morning decrement in lung function common to this population. However, recent studies have demonstrated that THEO may delay sleep onset and perturb sleep stage distribution. No previous study has evaluated electroencephalographic, cardiac, and gas exchange indices during sleep in asthmatics treated with THEO compared with a long-acting inhaled beta 2-agonist. The study goals were to determine if theophylline perturbed sleep when compared with beta 2-agonists and to determine which agent achieved best control of daytime and nocturnal pulmonary symptoms and lung dysfunction. We evaluated 26 subjects with mild to moderate asthma and a history of frequent nocturnal symptoms who previously demonstrated decrements in AM lung function. THEO was compared with 3 puffs every 8 h (6 A.M., 2 P.M., and 10 P.M.) of bitolterol (BITOL), a long-acting beta 2-agonist, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Each drug was administered for a 2-wk period ending with two consecutive nights of sleep evaluation followed by cross-over to the alternate drug regimen. During THEO administration, plasma concentrations on awakening were 11.4 +/- 0.69 micrograms/ml as compared with 0.00 micrograms/ml during BITOL. THEO was not found to disrupt sleep as sleep latency, total sleep time, percentage of total sleep time spent in Stages 1, 2, and 3/4 and in REM sleep were similar during each regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
