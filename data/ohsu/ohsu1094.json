In the last few years better techniques for stenting and intrabronchial radiotherapy (brachytherapy) have also been developed.

  ".U": "91297634\r", 
  ".W": "A form of pneumoconiosis in rural African women termed \"Transkei silicosis\" has been thought to be due to silica particles inhaled while they are hand grinding maize between rocks. Twenty five women were studied who were considered to have this condition according to the following criteria: rural domicile, radiographic and lung biopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis, no exposure to mining or industry and no evidence of active tuberculosis. They were assessed for radiological, pathological, physiological and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid features. Potential aetiological factors were assessed by determining levels of exposure to respirable quartz and non-quartz containing dusts and smoke in rural dwellings during maize grinding and cooking. Most of the women were symptomless. Radiological findings ranged from a miliary pattern to extensive fibrosis resembling progressive massive fibrosis. Histological features included simple \"anthracosis\" in 12, anthracosis with macules in six, and mixed dust fibrosis in seven. Cell numbers and their proportions in lavage fluid were normal. More than 60% of macrophages were heavily laden with inorganic inclusions. Respirable quartz concentrations and calculated cumulative time weighted exposures were below those recommended for industry during grinding with sandstone (100% quartz) and they were even lower during grinding with dolerite containing no quartz despite the presence of an appreciable amount of quartz in the ground maize. Total respirable dust and smoke concentrations were greater than the recommended safe levels. Three women had no exposure to maize grinding. It is concluded that the inhalation of non-quartz containing dust and smoke from biomass fuelled fires is more important in the aetiology of this condition than exposure to quartz dust. The term \"hut lung\" may be more appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "The Himalayan villages of Chuchot Shamma and Stok were surveyed because silicosis had been suspected from the radiographs of some of the inhabitants. The villages are agricultural, and Chuchot is exposed to frequent dust storms. Chest radiographs of villagers aged 50-62 were assessed blind by two independent observers using ILO criteria. In Chuchot five of seven men and all of the nine women examined showed varying grades of silicosis, compared with three of 13 men and seven of 11 women in Stok, which lies 300 metres higher and is exposed to fewer dust storms. The difference in prevalence of silicosis between the two villages was significant, as was the differences between men and women. Three patients from the village adjoining Chuchot were later found to have radiological evidence of progressive massive fibrosis. A necropsy on a man in a neighbouring village in the Indus valley showed classical silicosis in a hilar lymph node. Chemical analysis of the inorganic dust in the lung showed that 54.4% was elemental silicon [corrected]. This was similar to the silicon [corrected] content of dust samples collected from houses in Chuchot, which included particles of respirable size. X-ray microanalysis showed that quartz formed 16-21% of the inorganic lung dust. This study suggests that silicosis is common among the older inhabitants of these Himalayan villages. The dust exposure is clearly environmental and not industrial. Further studies are needed to define the extent and severity of silicosis in this community and to examine possible preventive measures.\r"

The carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in the women using the three types of fuel (mean (SEM) concentration 7.52% (0.67%) for kerosene, 15.74% (0.83%) for biomass fuel, and 17.16% (0.62%) for liquified petroleum gas, compared with 3.52% (0.33%) in the control subjects.

Comparison with a referent population showed that the all cause mortality among people with pulmonary tuberculosis was 10 times greater than that of the age and sex matched general population. This ratio fell with increasing age and with extent of disease.

Both the patients with asthma and the patients with chronic bronchitis varied considerably in their responses to the salbutamol and the ipratropium bromide. The mean increase in FEV1 in the subjects with asthma was higher after salbutamol (0.371 or 18% of the prebronchodilator value) than after ipratropium bromide (0.26 1 or 13%). In chronic bronchitis there was no difference between the increase in FEV1 after salbutamol (0.161 or 7%) and after ipratropium bromide (0.191 or 8%). When patients were categorised into those with a better response to salbutamol 400 micrograms and those with a better response to ipratropium bromide 80 micrograms, patients with chronic bronchitis responded better in general to ipratropium bromide whereas asthmatic patients responded better to salbutamol. The response pattern was also related to allergy and age, allergic patients and patients under 60 being more likely to respond better to salbutamol 400 micrograms than non-allergic patients and older patients, who benefited more from ipratropium bromide 80 micrograms. The response pattern was not related to sex, smoking habits, lung function, bronchial reactivity, respiratory symptoms, or number of exacerbations during the preceding year.\r"

  ".W": "\"Functional antagonism\" is often used to describe the general relaxant effect of beta 2 agonists and xanthines and their ability to protect the airways against bronchoconstrictor stimuli. This study in guinea pig isolated trachea addresses the question of whether the capacity of these drugs to protect against constrictor stimuli is related to smooth muscle relaxation. Three antimuscarinic drugs were also examined to determine whether antagonism of mediators other than muscarinic agonists might contribute to bronchodilatation by these antimuscarinic drugs. Terbutaline (1.1 x 10(-7), 2.2 x 10(-7) M), theophylline (2.2 x 10(-4), 4.4 x 10(-4) M), and enprofylline (5.2 x 10(-5), 1.0 x 10(-4) M) relaxed the tracheal tension that remained after indomethacin treatment. They did not, however, alter the carbachol concentration-response curve significantly. In addition, neither theophylline (2.2 x 10(-4) M) nor terbutaline (1.1 x 10(-7) M) altered histamine induced contraction. Atropine sulphate, glycopyrrolate, and ipratropium bromide had EC50 values of 10(-9) - 10(-8) M for relaxation of carbachol induced contractions, whereas concentrations of 10(-6) - 10(-3) M or greater were required to relax contractions induced by allergen and nine other non-muscarinic mediators. It is suggested that bronchodilatation by antimuscarinic drugs in vivo is due to inhibition of acetylcholine induced bronchoconstriction alone and that beta 2 agonists and xanthines have poor ability to protect airway smooth muscle against constrictor stimuli. Hence mechanisms other than bronchodilatation and \"functional antagonism\" should be considered to explain the protection against constrictor stimuli in asthma seen with beta 2 agonists and xanthines.\r"

  ".W": "A study was carried out to investigate whether an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system or release of histamine, or both, is responsible for the nocturnal increase in airflow obstruction in asthmatic children. The study comprised 18 children with allergic asthma, nine with (group 1) and nine without (group 2) nocturnal airflow obstruction, and an age matched control group. All drugs were withheld for three days before and during the study. On day 4 each child was admitted to hospital and a series of measurements was made every four hours for 24 hours. These included measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate and sinus arrhythmia gap from an electrocardiogram (an indirect measure of parasympathetic activity) and urine sampling for determination of catecholamine and N'-methylhistamine concentrations (measures of sympathetic activity and histamine release respectively). Urinary N'-methylhistamine excretion was significantly higher over the 24 hours in children in group 1 than in children in group 2, and overnight values were also significantly higher in children in group 1 than those in group 2. Mean (SEM) values (mumol/mol creatinine) were 154.6 (11.2) in group 1 and 110 (11.2) in group 2 for 2400-0400 hours samples and 139.2 (13.1) and 101.2 (10.6) 0400-0800 hours samples. There was no evidence of decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic activity in association with the nocturnal airflow obstruction; noradrenaline concentrations were increased in group 1. These observations indicate that nocturnal airflow obstruction is associated with increased release of histamine overnight.\r"

  ".W": "Inhaled corticosteroids are known to reduce respiratory symptoms and airway responsiveness in allergic patients with asthma. The aim of the present randomised, double blind study was to assess the effect of eight weeks' treatment with inhaled budesonide in non-allergic smokers with chronic obstructive lung disease. Twenty four subjects (23 male) entered the study. Their ages ranged from 40 to 70 (mean 57) years, with a mean of 35 (range 9-80) pack years of smoking; the mean FEV1 was 53% (range 32-74%) predicted and geometric mean PC20 (histamine concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1) 0.96 (range 0.07-7.82) mg/ml. After a two week washout, single blind, placebo period, 12 patients were allocated to treatment with budesonide 1600 microgram/day and 12 to placebo for eight weeks. The only additional drug to be taken was ipratropium bromide \"if needed.\" Twenty one patients completed the study, 10 in the budesonide group and 11 in the placebo group. The standard deviation of the difference between duplicate measurements of PC20 histamine and citric acid cough threshold made two weeks apart was below one doubling dose step. There was a significant reduction in dyspnoea in the budesonide group, but otherwise no change in symptom scores or use of ipratropium bromide over the eight weeks of treatment within or between the two groups. No significant differences in spirometric values, peak expiratory flow, PC20 histamine, or citric acid cough threshold were found between the groups. Although differences were not significant, some of the changes showed a trend in favour of budesonide. Whether a longer observation period would show a significant influence of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Factors influencing the labelling of rhinitis by doctors were examined in 7702 adults, aged 16-65 years, registered with a group general practice in south London. Individuals with rhinitis were identified by a postal screening questionnaire. Of the 2969 (39%) subjects who replied, 1309 (44%) reported rhinitis. A sample of 340 individuals with and 126 without rhinitis was studied, each being interviewed and having allergy skinprick tests. The information given at interview was compared with that recorded in the medical notes for 75 patients with rhinitis, selected at random to include 25 with seasonal symptoms only, 25 with perennial symptoms only, and 25 with both seasonal and perennial symptoms, plus 25 control subjects. Hayfever was defined as seasonal symptoms provoked by grass and a positive skin test response to grass pollen. Subjects with seasonal symptoms were nearly twice as likely as those with perennial symptoms to be labelled as having rhinitis by their doctor. More than a quarter of the subjects fulfilling our definition of hayfever had not been diagnosed as having hayfever. Subjects from the upper social classes were more likely than those from the lower social classes to be labelled as having hayfever, though there were no significant differences between social classes in the prevalence of hayfever according to our definition. It is concluded that rhinitis is frequently underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. Increased detection of hayfever could account for the steep rise in consultation rates seen in recent decades.\r"

In the presence of selective CD8 deficiency, however, other mechanisms, apparently mediated by the CD4 T-cell subset, contribute in a compensatory fashion to antiviral immunity. The protective CTL response to MCMV, at least in BALB/c mice, is elicited by a single epitope encoded by the major ie 1 and expressed in protein pp89. The epitope itself contains 18 amino acids, only five of which are the minimum for CTL recognition. Substitutions within a nonapeptide sequence that is part of the pp89 epitope identified two positions that are critical for TCR binding by clone IE1 CTLs. Polyclonal CTLs, in contrast, respond to either the native nonapeptide or any of the substituted variants that were tested, which suggests a certain degree of degeneracy in the specificity of the physiologic immune response.\r"

With the aid of previously reported placebo data, the intent was to compare the two dosage forms in terms of their ability to promote cervical ripening, and to see which dosage form was more effective in terms of influencing the overall incidence of cesarean section. The two groups showed a comparable improvement (alpha = 0.05) in cervical condition over that of the placebo group, with the mean Bishop score increasing by 2.0 points in the gel group, 2.5 points in the suppository group, and 0.7 points in the placebo group. As the suppository contained a lower dose of drug than the gel, the data support the concept that the type of drug vehicle and dosage form are important variables affecting product performance. No statistically significant difference in the incidence of cesarean section was noted between the two groups or between either group and placebo. This may be attributable to the small sample size and the relatively high proportion of women diagnosed as having cephalopelvic disproportion/failure to progress. Additional studies are warranted.\r"

Five healthy volunteers were studied in each of two age groups: from 25 to 37 and 60 to 68 years of age. Each volunteer had a total of lidocaine 300 mg administered as a gargle, gel, or directly to the vocal cords. Blood samples and expectorant were collected to determine concentrations of lidocaine and its metabolites, monoethylglycinxylidide (MEGX) and glycinxylidide (GX). No differences in peak plasma lidocaine concentrations, 2.09 +/- 1.28 mumol/L (1 microgram/mL = 4.27 mumol/L) in young subjects, and 2.35 +/- 0.85 mumol/L in young-elderly subjects, or lidocaine AUC were seen between the two age groups. Lidocaine recovered in expectorant ranged from 96 to 168 mg. This study suggests that, over the age range studied, increased age does not impair lidocaine absorption from the oropharynx or lidocaine metabolism when topical lidocaine is used during flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\r"

Labetalol HCl tablets (Trandate, Glaxo) were triturated, and suspended in distilled water, simple syrup, apple juice, grape juice, and orange juice to approximate concentrations of 7-10 mg/mL. After filtration, the liquids were stored in five amber, plastic prescription bottles, and five amber, glass prescription bottles at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C. The samples were collected at 0, 24, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, and 4 weeks after initiation of the study. Labetalol HCl was measured by an HPLC method. Because there was no substantial change in labetalol HCl concentration during the study period, the tablet dosage from can be reformulated, stored, and administered to elderly or pediatric patients as a liquid dosage form.\r"

Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis should be based on the two main potential pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. It is unclear whether the prophylactic use of antimicrobials can or should be guided by in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing; data from well-performed clinical trials should be evaluated. The data fail to demonstrate consistently a significant difference within the cephalosporin class of antimicrobials with regard to prevention of infectious complications. Although it does not reach statistical difference, the trend with respect to efficacy appears to be cefuroxime, then cefamandole, and then cefazolin. The lack of significant difference among antimicrobials suggests an institution-individualized approach to the selection of the optimal antimicrobial for prophylaxis. For our facilities we recommend the following regimen: cefazolin sodium 1-2 g iv q8h for two days. There are not enough data at this time to recommend less than two days of antimicrobial prophylaxis for this type of surgery. In addition, aminoglycosides provide no added benefit when added to cephalosporins.\r"

The best studied are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), both of which can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Clinical indications for these agents include bone marrow failure secondary to administration of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation, bone marrow transplantation, and a variety of congenital or iatrogenic neutropenias. Toxicity in usual clinical doses is mild, and consists mainly of bone pain and constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a lymphokine that stimulates that multiplication of several types of killer cells. These cells can recognize and destroy foreign substances, such as tumors, without destroying normal cells. Major applications of IL-2 include treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, in whom the overall objective response rate is 15-30 percent, and malignant melanoma with response rates of about 18 percent. Combination therapy with other biologics and conventional cytotoxic drugs may increase IL-2's efficacy against these tumors. Toxicity is generally severe, but reversible. Hemodynamic toxicity, consisting of hypotension, edema, weight gain, and decreased renal function, is most characteristic. Suggestions are given for pharmacologic management of these and other IL-2 toxicities.\r"

The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite, quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61 percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril. Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and enalapril. A small number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have been treated with quinapril. Preliminary data indicate that quinapril is an equally effective therapeutic alternative to presently available ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As a result, the Food and Drug Administration approved intravenous idarubicin with a Class 1A rating in September 1990 for use in combination with other antileukemic drugs (e.g., cytarabine) for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia in adults. The recommended dose of idarubicin is 12 mg/m2 daily for three days by slow intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine. Although idarubicin causes myelosuppression similar to that described with daunorubicin, the incidence of cardiotoxicity in animal models is lower. Idarubicin also has the advantage of oral administration, but the oral formulation of the drug remains investigational. The use of idarubicin in pediatric patients also remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "The new fluorinated adenine analog, fludarabine, has been tested for efficacy in many tumor types over the past ten years. Two other similar nucleoside analogs are currently available for commercial use. Cytarabine is used principally as an antileukemic agent, and vidarabine as an antiviral. Unlike vidarabine, fludarabine is resistant to deactivation by adenosine deaminase. Data from Phase I and II trials suggest that fludarabine is potentially effective in a number of leukemias, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Unfortunately, the doses required to achieve adequate response in the acute leukemias (greater than 75 mg/m2) were above the maximum tolerated dose, resulting in intolerable granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a life-threatening neurotoxic syndrome. In CLL: however, the dose required to achieve a satisfactory response is well within tolerated limits. Long-term survival statistics are not yet available, but historical perspective strongly correlates response to other agents with increased survival times. Toxicities seen at dose regimens of 15-40 mg/m2/d for five consecutive days include somnolence, metabolic acidosis, confusion, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine and aminotransferase concentrations, and pulmonary and hepatic abnormalities. Mild to severe hematologic toxicity has been observed at all dose levels.\r"

The drug is active in vivo against M. leprae and in vitro against MAC. In addition, it possesses antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Clinical studies support the efficacy of clofazimine as a part of multidrug therapy in treating leprosy. It also appears to reduce the incidence and severity of erythema nodosum leprosum reactions that often occur during the treatment of leprosy. Efficacy in treating MAC infection in patients with AIDS is not well documented, despite the use of clofazimine in combination with other agents. A few patients have responded symptomatically and by clearing their mycobacteremia, although there is no evidence that mortality is reduced. Clofazimine is well tolerated, at least when doses less than or equal to 100 mg/d are used. Adverse reactions include discoloration of the skin, self-limiting gastrointestinal intolerance, severe and life-threatening abdominal pain and organ damage due to clofazimine crystal deposition, and asymptomatic discoloration of the eye. Clofazimine should be considered for formulary inclusion.\r"

This article reviews the influence of age on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor responses. Evidence obtained in humans indicates that beta-adrenergic receptor numbers on peripheral blood cells may differ, although the direction of the change is not consistent among laboratories. Drug-induced regulation of receptors either up or down appears to be similar among age groups. The affinity of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites for isoproterenol decreases with aging. Events distal to the receptor recognition site itself exhibit age-related differences, presumably due to a decrease in the coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase. Mechanisms of decreased catecholamine responsiveness during aging remain to be defined. The precise definition of these alterations may contribute useful insights into the changes that occur with aging in response to catecholamines, other hormones, and neurotransmitters.\r"

Corticosteroids have been used in an attempt to reduce the incidence of meningitis-induced hearing loss. Some studies have demonstrated a decrease in the incidence of hearing impairment in patients treated with cefuroxime plus dexamethasone compared with cefuroxime alone. Similar data are lacking for other frequently used antibiotics. Based on these studies, the use of dexamethasone should be considered in infants and children greater than two months of age with suspected bacterial meningitis. Critical issues including the timing of steroid initiation in relation to antibiotic therapy and the appropriate antibiotic-corticosteroid regimen must be addressed. Studies should be performed to define the exact role of corticosteroids in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Until additional data are available, we recommend the use of dexamethasone in pediatric patients older than two months of age with bacterial meningitis.\r"

To present a more complete profile, the study analyzed the incremental costs associated with the hospital pharmacy and nursing staffs regarding various dosing frequencies, including different iv admixture and administration methods. Results showed that administration of an antibiotic dose costs approximately $3.35 based on labor and material costs associated with admixture and administration. An average of 4.6 minutes/dose saves nurses up to 23 minutes for each patient who receives an antibiotic dosed once rather than six times daily over a 24-hour period. Costs of administration and admixture should be considered in comparisons of combination therapy with monotherapy when deciding between two therapeutically equivalent alternatives.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CD22 and CD11c recognize B-lymphocyte- and monocyte-associated antigens, respectively. Reports indicate that when these two MoAbs co-express, they represent a unique marker for hairy cell leukemia (HCL) although neither is specific for that disease. The authors evaluated the expression and diagnostic utility of CD22 and CD11C in specimens from 26 normal subjects, 29 patients, with various nonlymphoproliferative disorders (NLPDs), and 75 patients with different types of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLDs) using two-color flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Lymphocytes co-expressed CD22 and CD11c in less than or equal to 3% of the normal subjects and in less than or equal to 6% of the patients with NLPDs. These markers were expressed in greater than 10% of the lymphocytes of 46% (32/69) of the patients with B-cell CLDs: B-cell chronic-lymphocytic leukemia, 9/41; B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 8/14; HCL, 11/11; B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (NOS), 1/2; and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, 1/1. None (0/6) of the lymphocytes of patients with T-cell CLDs expressed greater than 10% CD22-positive (CD22+) or CD11c-positive (CD11c+) cells. The HCL cases demonstrated a unique CD22+CD11c+ fluorescence histogram pattern, distinct from other lymphoproliferative disorders, that was characterized by uniformly intense CD11c and CD22 fluorescence. Differences in the expression of the CD22+CD11C- and CD22+CD11C+ phenotypes between diagnostic groups were found, most notable was a paucity of CD22+CD11c+ cells in lymphocytes of patients with HCL. CD22 also had more variable expression than CD19 and HLA-DR in the cases of B-cell CLD. This study demonstrates that the CD22+CD11c+ phenotype is not unique to HCL but is a consistent feature of that disorder and that the immunofluorescence pattern of co-expression in HCL is diagnostically useful.\r"

These \"intelligent machines\" are modeled after biological nervous systems and are fundamentally different from the many computerized expert systems that previously have been introduced as clinical decision-making aids. The authors describe a neural network designed and trained to predict the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on the analysis of paired sets of cardiac enzymes. The neural network predicted 24 of 24 (100%) AMIs and 27 of 29 (93%) No-AMIs when compared with a pathologist's interpretation of the patient's laboratory data (P less than 0.000001). The authors attempted to validate the network's diagnoses by two independent methods. When compared with echocardiogram and EKG for diagnosis of AMI, the neural network agreed with the cardiologist's interpretation in 12 of 14 (86%) AMIs and 1 of 3 (33%) No-AMIs, but the correlation was not statistically significant. Using autopsy outcome for validation, the neural network agreed with the anatomic evidence in 24 of 26 (92%) AMIs and 4 of 6 (67%) No-AMIs (P = 0.001). The authors conclude that neural networks can be successfully applied to the analysis of cardiac enzyme data and suggest that broader applications exist within the domain of clinical decision support.\r"

In addition, the ascitic fluid specimens were inspected for a lipid supernatant after 48 hours of refrigeration at 4 degrees C.

Only 17% of the clear specimens demonstrated any lipid layer after refrigeration, compared with 94% of opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). The triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the serum samples obtained from patients with clear compared with opalescent ascites.

  ".U": "91298311\r", 
  ".W": "To study the histogenesis of and determine the most useful markers for diagnosing anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 32 cases, including 2 with numerous osteoclast-like cells, were stained with a battery of antibodies to epithelial (keratin, epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), mesenchymal (vimentin, desmin, muscle-specific actin [MSA], Factor VIII-related antigen [FVIII:RAg]), endocrine (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, chromogranin [Cg]), lymphocytic (leukocyte common antigen [LCA]), histiocytic (alpha-1-antitrypsin [alpha 1AT], alpha-1-antichymotrypsin [alpha 1AChy], KP1), melanocytic (HMB-45), and Schwann cell (S-100 protein) markers. Five tumors were associated with papillary carcinoma. In one of these cases, a morphologic continuum between the well-differentiated carcinoma and the ATC was visualized by their positive immunostaining for both vimentin and keratin, thus supporting the hypothesis that the latter tumor originated from the former. Twenty-five (78.1%) tumors expressed keratin, 10 (31.3%) reacted for EMA, and 3 (9.4%) expressed CEA, confirming the epithelial nature of this neoplasm. Reactivity for thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) ATCs. Because all of the cases that expressed keratin also stained positively for EMA, CEA, or thyroglobulin, it is believed that keratin is the most useful epithelial marker for diagnosis of ATC. A lack of reactivity for calcitonin and Cg indicates that these tumors are not derived from C cells, as has been proposed by some authors. Reactivity for KP1 (CD68), a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a macrophage-associated antigen, occurred in the osteoclast-like cells but not in the anaplastic tumor cells. This finding, together with negative keratin staining of the osteoclast-like cells, indicates that these cells are not epithelial in nature and therefore should be considered reactive rather than neoplastic. Thirty tumors (93.8%) expressed vimentin, 15 (46.9%) marked for alpha 1AChy, 11 (34.4%) exhibited alpha 1AT, and 11 (34.4%) expressed S-100 protein. Because all of these markers can be seen in a wide variety of tumors of different histogeneses, they have no value in the diagnosis of ATC. Although immunostaining for FVIII:RAg, desmin, and MSA was negative in all of these tumors, these markers can help to differentiate between ATCs and some soft tissue sarcomas with which they can be confused.\r"

  ".W": "The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 is synthesized and expressed by early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and by many acute leukemias. Anti-CD34 antibodies also have been reported to stain blood vessels in tissue sections, and, more recently, CD34 mRNA has been detected in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the authors studied the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical CD34 antigen detection in tumors of endothelial cell derivation and compared the results with stains for von Willebrand (vW) factor. A wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms also were examined to assess the specificity of CD34 for vascular neoplasia. Seven cases of angiosarcoma (seven of seven), five cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (five of five), and eight cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (eight of eight) were moderately to strongly positive for CD34. This reactivity was equally intense in frozen sections, alcohol-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed specimens. In many cases, the malignant endothelial cells stained more strongly than adjacent benign endothelium. Moreover, in most cases CD34 positivity was quantitatively and qualitatively stronger than staining for vW factor. Two cases of hemangiopericytoma (two of two) were CD34 positive but stained less intensely than the angiosarcomas, Kaposi's sarcomas, or hemangioendotheliomas. Five of six cases of hemangioma also stained positively for CD34; the nonreactive tumor in this group was the only one among 28 vascular neoplasms studied that was not reactive for CD34. In comparison, 9 of the 28 vascular tumors did not stain for vW factor. Three hundred fifty-seven tumors of nonvascular derivation also were examined for CD34 antigen expression. Focal light staining was seen in one pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma; moderate to intense staining was observed in half of the epithelioid sarcomas studied (8 of 16) and in a minority of leiomyosarcomas (3 of 22). These findings indicate that CD34 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for neoplasms of vascular origin.\r"

The authors compared staining patterns for these markers in 576 samples of normal, reactive, and neoplastic tissues. The standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique was performed with the use of two commercial antibodies against MSA (HHF35; Enzo Biochemical, Inc., New York, NY) and desmin (DER11; DAKO Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA), respectively, on consecutive paraffin-embedded tissue sections from these cases. Both MSA and desmin were found in all 80 normal muscle samples. Although MSA appeared diffusely in all vascular smooth muscle samples, desmin was demonstrated focally in vascular smooth muscle cells in 100 of 196 samples. MSA but not desmin always was found in myoepithelial cells (25 samples), pericytes (286 samples), and decidual cells (7 samples). Among 76 cases of myofibroblast-containing lesions, 14 and 54 were found to have desmin and MSA, respectively. MSA and desmin were found in 4 of 4 cardiac rhabdomyomas, 34 of 34 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 5 of 6 leiomyomas. Among 22 leiomyosarcomas, 7 displayed either MSA or desmin and 7 showed both markers. In general, more tumor cells showed staining for MSA than desmin, but the reverse was true in some cases. Tissue fixed in Zenker's solution seemed to show a significant decrease in MSA immunoreactivity, but no significant change for desmin staining was observed. None of the 154 normal tissues and 22 benign nonmyogenic tumors expressed MSA or desmin. Among 133 malignant nonmyogenic tumors, positive staining for both desmin and MSA was found in 3 of 8 cases of glioblastoma multiforme, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas; staining for only MSA was found in 3 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, 6 of 6 fibromatoses, 1 of 1 mammary myofibroblastoma, and 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas; and staining for desmin only was seen in 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This epitope was expressed in 90 of 91 malignant ovarian tumors; in 88% of these, more than 50% of the tumor cells expressed the epitope. In 94% of the positive tumors, the epitope was expressed on the cell membrane; in 56%, cytoplasmic expression was evident; and in 39%, secreted extracellular antigen was detected. Differences were not clearly discernible between dissimilar histotypes with respect to the percentage of cells expressing antigen and antigen localization. Thirteen of 19 benign ovarian cystadenomas also expressed the epitope, but staining was weak and restricted to the luminal surface of the cell membrane. A blind retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of all second-look laparotomy biopsy specimens from 20 patients also was performed. All four patients in whom microscopic disease was detected by standard pathologic assessment had BC2-positive metastases. Of seven patients in whom recurrent disease subsequently developed despite negative pathologic findings, four had biopsy specimens containing BC2 antigen-positive adenocarcinoma-like cells. Of the nine patients with negative results on operation and no recurrence, one had biopsy specimens containing BC2 antigen-positive adenocarcinoma-like cells. Mesothelial cells, although typically negative, expressed the epitope in one biopsy specimen, necessitating caution in the interpretation of positive cells. The BC2 antibody is reactive with most epithelial ovarian carcinomas and appears to be a useful tool for the detection of micrometastases.\r"

  ".W": "The production of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) has permitted the development of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunocytochemical assay (ICA) for steroid receptor determination. The results obtained with these two techniques, using the same monoclonal antibodies, were compared in a large series of breast carcinomas (187 for ER and 100 for PR). The correlation between these methods was significant for ER (rs = 0.54) and PR (rs = 0.55) (P less than 0.001) but was lost when the receptor concentrations determined by EIA were less than or equal to 15 and less than or equal to 30 fmol/mg protein for ER and PR, respectively. When these values are considered as cutoffs, the concordance between the two methods was 84.5% for ER and 73% for PR. An analysis of discordant results revealed that low epithelial cellularity generally was present in ICA-positive, EIA-negative specimens, whereas only focal positivity with ICA, or positivity of only normal peripheral mammary ducts and lobules, frequently was found in ICA-negative, EIA-positive tumors. In conclusion, there is good correlation between the results obtained by EIA and ICA methods for detection of ER and PR. The authors suggest that biochemical and histochemical methods for steroid receptors could be considered complementary and used together for the analysis of breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer specimens from 116 patients were assayed for the presence of progesterone receptor (PR), with the use of a highly specific monoclonal antibody and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique on cryostat and permanent sections. Results were compared with those obtained by the conventional PR determination by dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay; they were in concordance in 90% of cryostat sections and 85% of paraffin-embedded tissue. The sensitivity and specificity of the PR immunocytochemical assay (PR-ICA) were 91% and 89% for frozen sections and 83% and 89% for permanent sections, respectively. The immunostained slides also were evaluated for several semiquantitative features, including staining intensity, heterogeneity of staining, and the proportion of positive tumor cells. A statistically significant correlation was found between the percentage of tumor cells stained with the PR immunocytochemical technique and the PR-cytosol levels (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the PR-ICA is an effective tool in the evaluation of PR content in breast cancer and can be applied in paraffin as well as frozen sections. This technique provides excellent morphologic detail, as well as tissue localization for PR. It also offers an alternative for assessment of PR when fresh tissue is not available for conventional hormone receptor analysis. The immunocytochemical assay can be performed easily at community hospitals. Because it requires only a small amount of tissue, PR-ICA is an ideal method for analyzing specimens of insufficient size for the DCC assay. This technique also is suited to the evaluation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens.\r"

The authors developed an automated procedure to complete the dewaxing and rehydration of tissue using a routine histologic tissue processor with a 24-hour timer. This technique provided excellent tissue recovery and reproducible DNA histograms comparable to those obtained by manual methods. Subsequently, the authors analyzed the DNA content of 93 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues. The automation of a significant portion of the routine processing required for paraffin-embedded tissue makes cytometric DNA analysis a more practical procedure in the laboratory.\r"

The observers agreed on gland size, gland uniformity, and the number of glands per field in only 49%, 31%, and 39% of cases, respectively. There were significant differences in the Gleason grades assigned by observers. Paired matching of individual Gleason grades showed agreement among observers in 44% (18 of 41), 56% (23 of 41), and 75% (31 of 41) of cases, respectively. This level of interobserver disagreement occurred even though cases with predominant patterns were selected carefully and those with variable patterns were excluded. A direct relationship appears to exist between increasing Gleason grade and increasing glandular variability, and there is an inverse relationship between Gleason grade, gland lumen area, and the number of glandular nuclei, as assessed by a group of pathologists.\r"

One specimen, a 3.0 x 2.5 cm mesenteric nodule, was found six days after a nondiagnostic transabdominal fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal mass. At frozen-section examination, the nodule had proliferating spindle-shaped cells interspersed with adipocytes that raised the possibility of well-differentiated liposarcoma. On permanent sections, however, there was fat necrosis and reactive spindle-shaped cells that immunohistochemically were consistent with myofibroblasts. In the second case, a needle tract was noted in breast tissue on which a biopsy was performed two days after a cytologic diagnosis of carcinoma. The 0.4-mm-wide tract contained neutrophils, foamy histiocytes, and clumps of intact, atypical epithelial cells without a desmoplastic or elastotic component. Aside from these epithelial cells, nothing in the biopsy specimen suggested invasive carcinoma. The cells were identical to those from a comedocarcinoma present in the biopsy and mastectomy specimens. These two cases provide examples of pitfalls that may arise during the examination of biopsy specimens obtained after fine-needle aspiration.\r"

This study compares the diagnostic accuracy and quality of frozen-section (FS) and cytologic preparations from 206 surgical specimens. The quality of cytologic preparations was significantly superior to that of FSs (P = 0.0001). With the use of a three-level accuracy scale suited to the practical demands of intraoperative evaluation, there was no significant difference between the accuracy of diagnosis by FS analysis compared with that achieved by cytologic examination (P = 0.35). More importantly--except in one case--whenever one technique did not correctly distinguish benign from malignant disease, the other technique yielded an essentially correct diagnosis. With the use of both techniques, 99.5% of cases were interpreted correctly, at least in regard to benign versus malignant diagnoses. Because significant additional time, equipment, stains, laboratory space, or personnel are not needed to implement intraoperative cytologic studies in a routine anatomic pathology laboratory, the authors advocate the simultaneous use of FS and cytologic studies in the specified context.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients had composite lymphoma in which Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involved the same anatomic site. Two of these patients had relapses of their tumors. In one, the initial biopsy specimen contained follicular and diffuse large cell NHL with unclassifiable HD, but the relapse showed diffuse large cell NHL with nodular sclerosis HD. In the other patient, both biopsy specimens showed follicular mixed NHL; the HD component in the initial biopsy specimen was nodular sclerosis, whereas, at relapse, it had the appearance of interfollicular HD. In the remaining seven patients, the HD component was subclassified as nodular sclerosis (three specimens) or mixed cellularity (three specimens), or it was unclassifiable (one specimen). The NHL component was categorized as diffuse large cell (two specimens), diffuse large cell immunoblastic (two specimens), follicular and diffuse large cell (one specimen), diffuse mixed small and large cell (one specimen), and lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation (modified Rappaport classification) (one specimen). Paraffin section immunoperoxidase studies were done on the NHL component in eight patients (nine specimens) and on the HD component in six patients (seven specimens). In each of these, the NHL component was leukocyte common antigen (LCA) positive and Leu-M1 negative. In addition, the neoplastic cells were L26 positive and UCHL-1 negative, indicating a B-cell phenotype. In five of seven immunophenotyped cases, Reed-Sternberg (RS) and Hodgkin's (H) cells from the HD areas were Leu-M1 positive and LCA negative, reflecting an immunophenotype that is typical of non-lymphocyte-predominant HD. In two specimens, the malignant cells were negative for Leu-M1 and LCA (with positive internal controls). Composite lymphomas composed of HD and NHL are unusual, and cases of coexistent HD of the non-lymphocyte-predominant subtype and NHL are even less common. The results of the current study and a review of the literature indicate that this phenomenon usually involves a B-cell NHL that coexists with HD, perhaps further suggesting a close relationship between the malignant cells of HD (RS and H cells) and B lymphocytes.\r"

Immunotypic evidence of monoclonality cannot be demonstrated routinely or reliably in routine paraffin-embedded sections. To determine whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with lymphoid cells in paraffin-embedded sections might be useful in distinguishing these confusing proliferations, the authors examined 45 follicular lymphomas and 30 follicular hyperplasia with the following antibodies; L26, B2, MT1, MT2, and UCHL-I. All sections were routine paraffin preparations from formalin- or B5-fixed tissue and were immunostained with the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Ninety-two percent of the B5-fixed and 77% of the formalin-fixed lymphomas were MT2 positive. None of the reactive hyperplasias stained positively, and none of the other antibodies demonstrated consistent differences between these benign and malignant proliferations. MT2 marks interfollicular T cells and mantle-zone B cells in normal lymph nodes but does not mark normal germinal centers; this staining pattern is retained in reactive hyperplasia. However, paradoxically, in most follicular lymphomas the neoplastic germinal centers show aberrant MT2 positively. The authors conclude that MT2 may be useful in distinguishing follicular lymphoma from follicular hyperplasia in paraffin sections.\r"

There was complete concordance between the light chain class of the plasma cells in the monoclonal cases and that of the circulating paraprotein in the 22 cases associated with a paraprotein. The remaining 22 patients had polyclonal plasma cells, although a paraprotein was detected in 6. The degree of plasmacytosis was significantly higher among patients with monoclonal plasma cells and correlated inversely with length of survival.

ABLC was markedly less toxic to mice when it was administered intravenously; it had a 50% lethal dose of greater than 40 mg/kg compared with a 50% lethal dose of 3 mg/kg for Fungizone, the desoxycholate form of amphotericin B. ABLC was efficacious against systemic infections in mice caused by Candida albicans, Candida species other than C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. ABLC was also efficacious in immunocompromised animals infected with C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and H. capsulatum. Against some infections, the efficacy of ABLC was comparable to that of Fungizone, while against other infections Fungizone was two- to fourfold more effective than ABLC. Against several infections. Fungizone could not be given at therapeutic levels because of intravenous toxicity. ABLC, with its reduced toxicity, could be administered at drug levels capable of giving a therapeutic response. ABLC should be of value in the treatment of severe fungal infections in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of antimicrobial agents applied topically to the skin surface in eradicating coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) residing in the stratum corneum underlying the surface was examined. Glabrous skin was sampled with a 26-cm2 contact plate containing Trypticase soy agar. Five antiseptic solutions and four antimicrobial ointments were evaluated. The antiseptic solutions (10% povidone-iodine, 2% aqueous iodine, 2% tincture of iodine, 70% ethanol, and 0.5% chlorhexidine-ethanol) were applied for 15 s with a gauze sponge. The antimicrobial ointments (iodophor, silver sulfadiazine, mupirocin, and a triple-antibiotic ointment containing neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin) were applied and covered for 6 h with gauze. After treatment, the surface was sampled, 15 to 25 keratinized layers were subsequently removed by sequential stripping with cellophane tape, and the stratum corneum was sampled. All agents were effective in eradicating CNS from the surface (80 of 88 trials). However, only 2% iodine (17 of 20 trials), iodophor (8 of 12), mupirocin (6 of 10), and the triple-antibiotic ointment (9 of 11) eradicated CNS from the stratum corneum reliably (greater than or equal to 50% of trials). The stratum corneum was repopulated with resident flora within 24 h of treatment with 2% iodine (4 of 4 trials), iodophor (6 of 7), or mupirocin (5 of 6), but repopulation occurred in only 1 of 7 trials with the triple-antibiotic ointment. Topical treatment of skin with antimicrobial agents usually eradicates CNS from the skin surface but may not eradicate CNS from the stratum corneum. Only the triple-antibiotic ointment eradicated CNS from the stratum corneum and prevented repopulation with resident flora.\r"

  ".W": "The mec gene of a number of clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates exhibiting a variety of heterogeneous expression modes was selectively inactivated by allelic replacement mutagenesis. While the resistance level of each of the transformants was reduced, the methicillin MIC for these transformants was well above the MIC for susceptible laboratory strains of S. aureus and was similar to the methicillin MIC for many contemporary clinical isolates which did not react with the mec-specific DNA probe but which showed a low or borderline level of resistance to methicillin. A number of those strains had no detectable beta-lactamase, and for about half of the isolates that did carry plasmid-borne beta-lactamase, elimination of the plasmid caused only partial reduction of the methicillin MIC or no reduction at all. The findings suggest that many contemporary strains of staphylococci harbor a combination of at least three distinct beta-lactam resistance mechanisms: (i) the mechanism related to the acquisition of the foreign mec gene and (ii) a beta-lactamase-dependent and (iii) a beta-lactamase-independent mechanism, each one of which can provide a certain degree of resistance against penicillinase-resistant beta-lactam antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacologic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 mg/kg/day) given once daily (qd) or thrice daily (tid) for the treatment of urinary tract infections were studied in a randomized prospective study of 60 cancer patients. The overall efficacy was 96%. Nephrotoxicity, assessed by the measure of urinary excretion of phospholipids, was lower for the patients receiving the qd regimen than for those receiving the tid regimen. Elevation of serum creatinine (20% over baseline) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and in three receiving the tid regimen. Cochleotoxicity, assessed by pure-tone audiometry (250 to 18,000 Hz) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and none receiving the tid regimen. Concentrations in sera were measured on days 1 and 5. No significant accumulation was observed in either group. Median serum bactericidal titers, expressed as reciprocal values (percentage of the sera with a titer greater than or equal to 8), were measured against 25 test organisms in samples collected 6 h after the administration of netilmicin and were, for the qd group, 16 (82%) against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (8%) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the tid group, 4 (57%) against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (0%) against P. aeruginosa. The rate of killing in serum was rapid (2 to 3 log in 2 h against P. aeruginosa; 3 to 5 log in 2 h against members of the Enterobacteriaceae) and correlated with the sampling time and hence the concentration in serum of netilmicin. The duration of the postantibiotic effect in serum depended also on the strain and the sampling time of the serum.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of ofloxacin, a new antibacterial quinolone gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor antagonist, on the global and regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (cMRgl). Twelve healthy normal male volunteers (mean age, 26.7 years) were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol of 11 days' duration. Results of a total of 42 positron emission tomography studies were obtained for these subjects: 12 base line, 18 during placebo, and 12 during ofloxacin administration. The conditions under which repeat positron emission tomography studies of the same subject were performed were reproduced as closely as possible. cMRgl was measured in 24 brain regions. The global cMRgl for base line, placebo, and ofloxacin were 8.82 +/- 1.17, 8.24 +/- 1.17, and 8.79 +/- 1.18 mg/min/100 g, respectively (mean +/- 1 standard deviation). The mean global differences between base line and placebo and between ofloxacin and placebo were 5.1 and 6.6%, respectively. Analysis of variance of both the global and the regional cMRgl showed no statistical difference between base-line, placebo, and ofloxacin studies. Variations in cMRgl found in this study were not related to the presence of ofloxacin. Results of our study demonstrate that ofloxacin does not increase or decrease cMRgl beyond the limits of variability of the study.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen healthy, nonsmoking adult males participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study to evaluate the influence of chronic lomefloxacin administration on the disposition of caffeine and its major metabolite, paraxanthine, at steady-state conditions. Lomefloxacin (400 mg) or placebo was administered orally once daily for 5 days to xanthine-free volunteers after an overnight fast. Caffeine (200 mg orally) was administered simultaneously with lomefloxacin on days 3 through 5. After a 2-day washout period, subjects were crossed over to the alternate 5-day regimen with caffeine, which was again given on the final 3 days. Blood samples for caffeine, paraxanthine, and lomefloxacin concentration determinations were serially collected for 48 h following the last dose of each regimen. All compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. For the placebo versus lomefloxacin-containing treatments, maximum caffeine concentrations in plasma (4.35 +/- 0.63 versus 4.07 +/- 0.56 micrograms/ml), areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h at steady state (30.3 +/- 6.9 versus 29.7 +/- 6.6 micrograms.h/ml), and elimination half-lives of caffeine (4.8 +/- 1.1 versus 4.8 +/- 1.2 h) were not significantly different. In addition, there were no significant changes in the disposition parameters of paraxanthine as a result of lomefloxacin administration. The frequencies of central nervous system-related effects for the two treatments were not statistically different. We conclude that lomefloxacin has no significant effect on the disposition of caffeine in young healthy volunteers.\r"

  ".U": "91298691\r", 
  ".W": "CP-65,207 is a new broad-spectrum penem antimicrobial agent that is a 1:1 mixture of two stereoisomers. Five minutes after a 10-min intravenous infusion of 1 g of CP-65,207 to volunteers, mean concentrations in serum were 33 micrograms of the R isomer per ml and 29 micrograms of the S isomer per ml. Following rapid distribution, half-lives of the isomers were 53 and 55 min, respectively. Concentrations in urine exceeded 800 micrograms of each isomer per ml. Recovery of the S isomer in urine (46%) was much greater than recovery of the R isomer (26%). The serum kinetics of the S isomer (volume of distribution, 319 ml/kg; total clearance, 315 ml/min; elimination rate constant, 0.80 h-1 were similar when it was given alone and when it was contained in CP-65,207, demonstrating that the presence of the R isomer has little effect on the serum kinetics of the S isomer. However, when the S isomer was given alone, the urinary recovery of intact S isomer (36%) was substantially lower than that when it was given with the R isomer as CP-65,207 (57%). Administration of the S isomer alone did not produce the unpleasant sulfurous odor in urine that was observed following administration of CP-65,207. Oral doses of a prodrug, which contained 1 g of CP-65,207, produced peak concentrations in serum of 1.6 micrograms of the R isomer per ml and 1.8 micrograms of the S isomer per ml. Approximately 36% of the S-isomer component was absorbed, and 20% of this isomer was recovered in urine. A 1-g oral dose of the prodrug of the single S isomer provides concentrations in serum above 1.0 microgram/ml (the MIC for 90% of over 1,000 hospital pathogens) for 3.5 h, suggesting that the drug given orally will prove to be efficacious against many infections.\r"

  ".U": "91298692\r", 
  ".W": "In a prospective randomized study, 120 febrile, granulocytopenic patients received as initial therapy ceftazidime with or without teicoplanin. At the onset of fever, patients had no obvious infectious focus. For 103 assessable episodes, initial bacteremias were detected in 18 of 51 patients (35%) given ceftazidime and 20 of 52 patients (38%) given the combination; 13 and 17 bacteremias caused by gram-positive bacteria occurred in these groups, respectively. There was no difference in terms of the final response (25 of 51 patients [49%] treated with ceftazidime alone versus 33 of 52 patients [63%] given the combination), and the morbidity was comparable for both treatment groups. The duration of fever and of total antibiotic therapy were similar in both groups. Initial therapy was modified in 26 patients (51%) treated with ceftazidime, with 20 surviving the infection, and in 19 patients (37%) treated with the combination, with 15 surviving. Persistent fever was the main reason for changing treatment, and no patient died of a gram-positive infection. Subsequent infective events occurred in 16 patients (31%) given ceftazidime and in 25 patients (48%) given the combination. Lung infiltrates developed in 12 and 13 patients, respectively, but more new infections occurred in the combination group. Allergic skin reactions were also more frequent in this group. Thus, while teicoplanin provides simple, reliable, and safe treatment of patients with presumed gram-positive infections, it is not useful when given empirically to this patient population, and treatment may result in more infective complications and adverse events.\r"

Similar in spectrum to ribavirin, EICAR was particularly active (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.2 to 4 micrograms/ml) against poxviruses (vaccinia virus), togaviruses (Sindbis and Semliki forest viruses), arenaviruses (Junin and Tacaribe viruses), reoviruses (reovirus type 1), orthomyxoviruses (influenza A and B viruses), and paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza virus type 3, measles virus, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus, and respiratory syncytial virus). EICAR was also cytostatic for rapidly growing cells (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.2 to 0.9 microgram/ml). EICAR inhibited vaccinia virus tail lesion formation at doses that were not toxic to the host. EICAR is a candidate antiviral drug for the treatment of pox-, toga-, arena-, reo-, orthomyxo, and paramyxovirus infections.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal therapeutic strategies for serious infections caused by borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) strains have not been fully characterized. Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Multiple serum samples were obtained over 7 to 14 days. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on days 1 and 5. Serum concentration-time data were analyzed by using multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analysis (NONLIN84). Results were compared with pharmacokinetic parameters derived from previous studies in normal healthy volunteers following multiple intravenous infusions of teicoplanin (3 to 6 mg/kg/day). Total and renal clearances of teicoplanin in IVDA patients were found to be significantly greater and more highly variable than those observed previously in normal healthy volunteers. As a result, predicted steady-state trough concentrations in serum may vary up to fivefold. The mechanism responsible for this variation appears to be related to the glomerular filtration rate. In IVDA patients, individualized teicoplanin dosage may be required in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.\r"

In hairless mice infected intracutaneously with HSV-1 or HSV-2, HPMPC completely suppressed all manifestations of the disease (skin lesions, paralysis of the hind legs, and mortality) if it was administered topically at a concentration of as low as 0.1, 0.3, or 1%. Similarly, HPMPC completely suppressed TK- HSV-1 infection in athymic nude mice if it was administered topically at 0.1 or 0.3% or intraperitoneally at 100 or 250 mg/kg/day. HPMPC was also effective against intraperitoneal HSV infection if it was given orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day or higher. In mice inoculated intracerebrally with HSV-2, intraperitoneal HPMPC treatment achieved a significant and dose-dependent protection at doses ranging from 5 to 400 mg/kg/day. The protective effect of HPMPC (at 200 mg/kg/day) was accompanied by a complete inhibition of virus multiplication in the brain. In all models of infections studied, the efficacy of HPMPC proved to be superior to that of acyclovir. The most remarkable feature of HPMPC was that a single administration of the compound, even as late as 4 days after infection, conferred significant protection against HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. Topical or systemic HPMPC treatment is efficacious in murine models of HSV-1, HSV-2, and TK- HSV infections.\r"

Treatment failures also occurred in the two patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis. The failures were associated with low serum itraconazole concentrations (less than 2.5 micrograms/ml) in both patients. All other patients had mean trough levels in serum above 5 micrograms/ml. One patient who was improving on 600 mg/day developed a progressive infection after reduction of the dose to 400 mg/day. Side effects included reversible adrenal insufficiency in one patient; severe hypokalemia, mild diastolic hypertension, and rhabdomyolysis in one patient; mild hypokalemia and hypertension in four other patients; and breast tenderness in one patient. The mean decrease in serum potassium during treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.05). Selected patients with severe systemic mycoses may benefit from prolonged high-dose itraconazole treatment.

Putative ribosomal binding sites and -10 and -35 sequences were located at the 5' end of the gene. The size of the polypeptide was confirmed through minicell analysis of the expression products of plasmids containing the sequence. The use of the gene as a molecular probe revealed its specificity toward strains harboring genes coding for related enzymes. This probe is therefore useful for epidemiological studies.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of cefetamet were determined after intravenous (i.v.) administration of cefetamet and oral administration of cefetamet pivoxil syrup to patients between the ages of 3 and 12 years. The patients were hospitalized for reconstructive urological surgery; to prevent infection, prophylactic i.v. cefetamet was administered on the day of surgery and oral cefetamet pivoxil was administered 2 days later. After i.v. administration, the mean (+/- standard deviation) half-life of cefetamet was 1.97 +/- 0.60 h (n = 18), which was different from the 2.46 +/- 0.33 h reported for nine adults (22 to 68 years old) in a previous study. The average values for the mean residence times were 2.35 +/- 0.94 and 2.83 +/- 0.34 h and the average values for the fraction of the dose eliminated unchanged in the urine were 79.9% +/- 8.99% and 80% +/- 11% in children and adults, respectively. Plots of mean systemic clearance and steady-state volume of distribution versus body weight for the children and comparative adults were linear on log-log coordinates, and the slopes of the plots were 0.661 and 0.880, respectively. These slope values suggested that mean systemic clearance values per unit of body surface area were similar in children and adults and that maintenance doses for children should be the adult maintenance dose multiplied by the child's surface area divided by 1.73 m2. The mean (+/- standard deviation) oral bioavailabilities of cefetamet pivoxil were 49.3% +/- 15.7% in 3- to 7-year-old children who received a 500-mg dose and 37.9% +/- 10.0% in 8- to 12-year-old children who received a 1,000-mg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) mice were infected intracerebrally with 150 to 300 CFU of Cryptococcus neoformans. In mortality studies, treatment was initiated 24 h postinfection and continued for 10 to 14 days with either fluconazole (1 to 15 mg/kg of body weight per day), flucytosine (60 to 120 mg/kg/8 h), both drugs, or 0.3% Noble agar (control). Combined therapy delayed mortality significantly when compared with controls and single-drug regimens. This was observed over a broad range of doses. Quantitative determinations of CFU in brain tissue demonstrated a significantly lower burden of C. neoformans in mice receiving combined therapy. The results indicate that combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine is superior to single-drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro antiproliferative effects of ICI 195,739, a recently developed bis-triazole derivative (T. Boyle, D. J. Gilman, M. B. Gravestock, and J. M. Wardleworth, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 544:86-100, 1988; J. F. Ryley, S. McGregor, and R. G. Wilson, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 544:310-328, 1988), on epimastigotes and amastigotes of Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi and some aspects of its mechanism of action are described. Despite previous claims that triazole compounds act on susceptible organisms by essentially the same mechanism demonstrated for the imidazole compounds, i.e., by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol at the level of the cytochrome P-450-dependent C-14 demethylation of lanosterol, our results indicate that ICI 195,739 acts on T. cruzi epimastigotes by a dual mechanism which involves blockade of ergosterol byosynthesis and a second, still-unidentified target whose alteration leads to immediate growth arrest. Although ICI 195,739 blocks ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of C-14 lanosterol demethylation, as shown by gas-liquid and thin-layer chromatography, growth arrest in ICI 195,739-treated cells is not related to the depletion of the endogenous ergosterol pool, contrary to what was previously found for ketoconazole, the reference compound among antifungal and antiprotozoal azole derivatives. Consistent with this observation is the fact that the concentration of ICI 195,739 required to inhibit de novo synthesis of ergosterol in epimastigotes by 50% is 60 nM, which is essentially identical to that previously found for ketoconazole under identical conditions, while the minimum concentration required to produce complete growth inhibition is 0.1 microM, which is 300 times lower than that of ketoconazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ultrastructural alterations induced in vitro by ICI 195,739, a recently developed bis-triazole derivative with potent antiproliferative effects on Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi, are reported. On epimastigotes, the triazole at its minimum growth-inhibitory concentration (0.1 microM) produced immediately (within 24 h) gross alterations in the organization of chromatin and the appearance of large electron-dense granules; at this time, many cells were binucleated, indicating a blockade in cytokinesis. At later times (120 h), mitochondrial swelling, a characteristic effect reported previously for the dioxolane-imidazole ketoconazole when the performed ergosterol pool is depleted, was the predominant effect and led to cell lysis. In amastigotes proliferating in Vero cells, the drug at 10 nM produced mitochondrial swelling, autophagic vacuoles, and massive alterations of the plasma membrane, leading to complete parasite destruction after 96 h of incubation of the infected monolayers with the drug. The results support previous conclusions that ICI 195,739 has a dual mechanism of action against T. cruzi, involving blockade of ergosterol biosynthesis and a direct effect on cell division which cannot be reversed by addition of exogenous ergosterol.\r"

Therefore, alternative laboratory-based in vitro tests are required to predict the outcome. Fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, and co-trimoxazole were tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 in vitro and in the tissue-cage animal model. The importance of early treatment was evaluated by starting the drugs either 30 min before or 4, 12, and 24 h after bacterial challenge. Results were compared with the in vitro drug efficacy against nongrowing and adherent Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The alternative in vitro tests correlated highly with the outcome in the tissue-cage animal model. In the prophylaxis group (drug given 30 min before bacterial challenge), co-trimoxazole was less efficacious than the other three drugs (P less than 0.001). In delayed treatment, ciprofloxacin showed the highest cure rate. It was also more potent than the other drugs against nongrowing and adherent E. coli ATCC 25922. The efficacies of aztreonan, fleroxacin, and ciprofloxacin dropped significantly (P less than 0.01) when the time interval between bacterial challenge and the start of treatment was delayed to greater than 4 h. These data emphasize (i) the need for proper timing of prophylaxis in patients undergoing implant surgery, and (ii) the possibility of successful treatment of established device-related infections with drugs which kill not only growing but also nongrowing and adherent bacteria.\r"

In August 1986, we measured the lung function of 1,440 adults who were 40-69 y of age and who had never smoked. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) were adjusted for height, sex, and age. Outdoor ambient air pollution measurements from the World Health Organization Global Air Pollution Monitoring Station were very different in the three study areas; the annual mean concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in residential, suburban, and industrial areas were 128, 18, and 57 micrograms/m3, respectively, and annual mean concentrations of total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) were 389, 261, and 449 micrograms/m3, respectively. Coal was most frequently used for domestic heating in the residential (92%) and suburban (96%) areas compared with the industrial area (17%). Heating with coal was associated with a reduced FEV1.0 (-91 +/- 36 ml) and FVC (-84 +/- 41 ml). Living in the residential area was associated with an additional reduction in FEV1.0 (-69 +/- 34 ml) and FVC (-257 +/- 37 ml). After we adjusted for age, height, and sex, an inverse linear association was found between In outdoor SO2 (or TSPM) concentration and FEV1.0 and FVC in subjects who had and had not used coal stove heating. Regression analysis results showed that a per-unit increase in In SO2 (TSPM) concentration (microgram/m3) could result in a 35.6 (131.4) ml reduction in FEV1.0 and a 142.2 (478.7) ml reduction in FVC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CTS questionnaires, physical examinations, and quantitative sensory function determination through neuroselective current perception threshold (CPT) measurements were obtained from the median digital nerves of 16 assembly line workers who were symptomatic with hand pain. Median nerve evaluations by CPT detected sensory abnormalities in 75% of the workers, and abnormalities in 50% of the workers were detected by clinical evaluations (p less than .05, df = 22). CPT abnormalities were characterized as \"hypoesthetic\" in 25% and hyperesthesic in 42% of the workers. The noninvasive, nonaversive CPT technique provided sensitive and easily obtained quantitative measures. Regular use of this procedure in the occupational setting may assist in preventing the development of advanced CTS for it provides early detection of median nerve abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "A 145-acre potato field adjacent to Dorris, California, was treated with ethoprop (Mocap) to control nematodes. Ethoprop releases n-propyl mercaptan, a highly odorous and volatile gas, as a degradation product of the pesticide. An epidemiological investigation was undertaken by the California Department of Health Services because community residents sought medical attention for odor-related illness. Elevated health effects were found among those who reported smelling a strong odor (n-propyl mercaptan has a characteristic onion-like odor). In a logistic regression analysis, the most highly elevated 6-wk health effect incidence risks, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, sex, and current cigarette smoking status, were for headache (OR = 5.08), diarrhea (OR = 3.80), runny nose (OR = 5.31), sore throat (OR = 3.58), burning/itching eyes (OR = 5.64), fever (OR = 3.59), hay fever attacks (OR = 3.50), and asthma attacks (OR = 6.0). Based upon these elevated health effects, it is recommended that human exposures to n-propyl mercaptan be minimized to the extent practicable.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate internal exposure to chromium in welders who were exposed to low levels of chromium. Chromium in urine, blood, and seminal fluid was determined among 60 welders and 45 referents. The concentration of chromium in urine and blood did not change across a workshift or across a 3-wk break in exposure. However, stainless-steel and mild-steel welders who were exposed to low levels of chromium and steel welders who were mildly exposed had significantly increased levels of chromium in post-shift urine (mean 2.1 nmol/mmol creatinine [standard deviation (SD) = 1.0] and 1.3 nmol/mmol creatinine [SD = 0.5], respectively) compared with referents (mean 0.7 nmol/mmol creatinine [SD = 0.3]). Pre-shift blood chromium concentrations showed a similar variation between exposed workers and referents. Subgroups of stainless-steel welders had very high levels of chromium in seminal fluid. This finding may, however, be explained by nonoccupational factors and, therefore, warrants further study. Attention should focus on the potential risk of delayed health effects among stainless-steel and mild-steel welders who heretofore were not thought to be at risk from chromium exposure.\r"

Samples were collected so as to minimize contamination, and they were analyzed using sensitive techniques. These workers also completed a questionnaire that addressed potentially important third variables. Individual analyses suggested that exercise, drinking beer, past employment in chromium-related occupations, and diabetic status had an important effect on urinary chromium levels. These variables were entered into a regression model and were all found to be significant predictors of urinary chromium level (p less than .10). Some variables were also examined for their influence on RBC chromium level, but none had a measurable effect.\r"

The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings.\r"

A study was performed comparing the cardiorespiratory function of 13 such patients before and after operation as well as with a control group of 15 patients who underwent similar procedures without complication. The groups were comparable in preoperative pulmonary function, though more patients in the study group had evidence of chronic lung disease. Patients were studied 2 to 39 months after the original procedure. Late postoperative pulmonary function test results, exercise tolerance, and oxygen uptake were not significantly different between the groups, and pulmonary function test results were unchanged in those patients who were tested preoperatively. We conclude that muscle flap reconstruction for sternal infection can be expected to give good long-term functional results. Exercise tolerance and pulmonary function may not differ from a control group of cardiac surgical patients, despite the altered composition of the chest wall. Patients with chronic lung disease may be more prone to have this complication.\r"

In newborns and infants, this procedure is still controversial because of the unknown long-term results and the lack of donor organs. Since March 1988, we have performed orthotopic heart transplantation in 11 infants and children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 6), cardiomyopathy (n = 4), or congenital endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 1). The smallest infant was 3 days old and weighed 2,650 g. Four of 15 potential donors had to be refused for various medical reasons, and 4 were transferred to our hospital for organ retrieval. Seven hearts were procured remotely. We accepted weight mismatches up to 105% between donor and recipient. There were three perioperative deaths, two in patients 5 and 17 days old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 1 in a 2-year-old patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy. All 3 patients had drug-resistant right heart failure. A 2-year-old girl with a dilated cardiomyopathy died 2 months after transplantation owing to severe pulmonary embolism originating from the superior vena cava. The remaining 7 patients are alive and well between 1 month and 31 months after transplantation. Angiographic follow-up has not revealed signs of graft atherosclerosis at 2 years.\r"

  ".W": "Although transvenous pacing is feasible in infants and children, uncertainty remains as to how to allow for future growth at the time of lead insertion. Accordingly, we retrospectively reviewed the relation between age and transvenous lead length. Standard posteroanterior chest roentgenograms were reviewed for 26 patients with transvenous pacemakers inserted at Babies Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital between 1985 and 1989. Sixteen of these were children (age range, 0.75 to 15 years) and 10 were adults (age range, 27 to 90 years). The intravascular length of right ventricular pacing leads was measured as projected on the roentgenogram. In 10 children, the presence of lead loops in the right atrium required the lead length that would have resulted from conventional placement to be estimated. Results for right ventricular pacing lead lengths were correlated with age using linear regression analysis. Average uncorrected lead length measured on the roentgenogram was 345 +/- 35 mm (standard deviation) in adults and 222 +/- 51 mm in children. The use of right atrial loops increased implanted lead length by an estimated 79 mm, from 188 +/- 26 to 267 +/- 43 mm. The difference between lead length in children and adults was analyzed. Approximately 190 mm of additional right ventricular pacing lead in infants and 100 mm in 10-year-old children was needed for growth to adult size. We conclude that an 80-mm right atrial lead loop will allow 6 to 12 years (mean, 8 years) of growth in infants and children without the need for reoperation to adjust lead length.\r"

Thus, allopurinol was tested to see if it could reduce cardiac complications during open heart operations. Ninety patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied prospectively. Fortyfive patients were treated with allopurinol and 45 patients acted as controls. Treatment requiring arrhythmias in the allopurinol group was 6.6% compared with 33.3% in the control group (p less than 0.01). The percentage of patients requiring inotropes was significantly lower in the allopurinol group than in the control group (4.4% versus 26.6%; p less than 0.01). Perioperative myocardial infarction did not occur in the allopurinol group but was seen in 8 patients (17.7%) in the control group. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used in 5 control patients (11.1%) but not in the allopurinol group. This study shows that allopurinol decreases significantly the incidence of cardiac complications in open heart operations.\r"

Brain-dead organ donors and patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass are chemically hypothyroid with significantly reduced circulating free triiodothyronine (T3). To test the hypothesis that T3 enhances left ventricular function in a hormonally deficient environment, a total of 36 healthy New Zealand White rabbit hearts were studied using a modified Langendorff preparation with Krebs-Henseleit perfusate and intra-ventricular balloon. In 9 normal rabbit hearts a cumulative dose-response curve with logarithmically increasing doses of T3 was obtained. The vehicle solution for T3 dissolution served as control (n = 9). Left ventricular function was assessed from peak developed pressure at baseline and after T3 administration. Triiodothyronine had no effect in normal hearts on peak developed pressure or end-diastolic pressure. In 18 rabbits, the acute effect of T3 administration after ischemia was investigated. Preischemic left ventricular function was measured to serve as baseline, and hearts were subjected to 37 degrees C global ischemia. Triiodothyronine (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was infused during reperfusion, and left ventricular peak developed pressure was measured at 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Recovery of function (expressed as percent return of left ventricular peak developed pressure) was significantly improved within 15 minutes of reperfusion (65.0% +/- 2.1% versus 80.2% +/- 4.1%) and remained significantly improved throughout the reperfusion period (p less than 0.05 by analysis of variance). These data suggest that although T3 possesses no inotropic properties, it significantly improves postischemic left ventricular function. The rapidity of the functional improvement suggests that these effects may be due to plasma membrane-mediated mechanisms.\r"

However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%.

Ninety-one patients were less than 18 months old (mean age, 6.2 months; mean weight, 5.8 kg) and were repaired using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. There were 15 perioperative deaths. Twelve patients were older (mean age, 40.2 months; mean weight, 18.9 kg) and were repaired using moderate hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass. There were two perioperative deaths. Repairs were performed with the single-patch technique. Four younger patients required repeat repair to control residual mitral regurgitation. Two of the older children required late reoperation to replace one or both atrioventricular valves. Three younger children underwent pulmonary artery banding initially; 1 died after complete repair. Three older children underwent initial pulmonary artery banding; 2 died at definitive repair, and the survivor required pulmonary artery reconstruction, which was repeated subsequently. Since 1977 our policy has been to perform primary definitive repair whenever possible. Two patients died late from unrelated causes. At the most recent follow-up the majority of patients had no or minimal symptoms. We continue to advocate primary definitive repair whenever possible using the single-patch technique in symptomatic patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect.\r"

Preoperative evaluation of valvar morphology and function involved echocardiograms in 21% (7/33) and echocardiograms with cineangiograms in 79% (26/33). All infants operated on were included in the analysis. Patients with other complicating abnormalities were not excluded. All operations used a two-patch technique for closure of the atrioventricular septal defect in association with mitral valve repair. The newly formed septal leaflet of the mitral valve was repaired using unpledgeted interrupted sutures. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiograms were used to evaluate mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction as mild, moderate, or severe. The 30-day mortality was 6% (2/33). Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 60 months. Postoperative mitral valve insufficiency was mild in 84% versus 6% preoperatively, moderate in 3% versus 52% preoperatively, and severe in 13% versus 42% preoperatively. Mitral valve dysfunction necessitating reoperation occurred in 6% (2/31). Mitral valve function postoperatively was improved compared with preoperatively (p less than 0.001). The low 30-day operative mortality and the excellent late postoperative valvar function demonstrate the value of single-stage two-patch repair of atrioventricular septal defect early in life.\r"

Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality. Marfan aneurysms with a diameter of 6 cm or greater should be repaired with the Bentall composite graft procedure, even if the patient is asymptomatic.\r"

Blood samples were obtained from 14 patients preoperatively, at specific times throughout cardiopulmonary bypass, and serially to 24 hours postoperatively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid-binding globulin, total thyroxine, triiodothyronine (T3), and reverse T3, an inactive metabolite of thyroxine, were measured by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 was assayed by equilibrium dialysis. Values of total T3 and free T3, the active hormone, were significantly depressed (75% and 50%, respectively) up to 24 hours after bypass (p less than 0.05). Reverse T3 demonstrated a greater than fourfold rise at 8 and 24 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Thyroid-binding globulin was decreased at all sampling times (p less than 0.05). Thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine, and free thyroxine levels remained within normal ranges at all sampling times. These results indicate that cardiopulmonary bypass simulates the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" as seen in severely burned patients and critically ill patients, which is characterized by depression of T3 and free T3 concentrations with a concomitant increase in reverse T3 levels and normal concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine, and free thyroxine. The hemodynamic effects of primary hypothyroidism are well established. These data provide further support for investigational trials of intravenous administration of T3 in the prevention or treatment of low cardiac output syndrome after cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".U": "91298808\r", 
  ".W": "Our purpose was to examine changes in pulmonary hemodynamics for patients with pulmonary contusion. Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and shunt fraction were calculated from standard measurements in 25 traumatized patients. The percent of lung volume injured, measured as air-space filling disease (ASF), was quantitated from computed tomograms using a previously described technique. The amount of reactive pulmonary vasoconstriction per unit of injury (PVRI/ASF) identified 3 groups of patients: 5 were reactors (PVRI/ASF greater than 15), 10 were weak-reactors (PVRI/ASF = 5 to 15), and 10 were nonreactors (PVRI/ASF less than 5). In the reactor group PVRI increased as the size of contusion (ASF) increased (r = 0.99). In weak-reactors PVRI also increased with the size of contusion (r = 0.93), but the slope was less pronounced. In both groups shunt fraction did not rise above 0.31. In the nonreactors, PVRI remained normal while shunt fraction increased with the extent of injury (r = 0.95). These results indicate that pulmonary vasoconstriction often occurs after pulmonary contusion. The vasoconstriction most probably represents a compensatory mechanism to limit perfusion of traumatized parenchyma, thereby minimizing increases in shunt fraction. Some patients (nonreactors) not demonstrating this response have unchecked increases in shunt fraction. This insight into the hemodynamic sequelae of pulmonary contusions may enhance our ability to provide optimal care for patients suffering from this injury.\r"

In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve. Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure. We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement.\r"

They are lined by ciliated epithelium and have focal areas of hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial glands within their walls. They are seldom seen in the adult, and most are thought to be asymptomatic and free of complications. During a 20-year period, 86 patients underwent resection of a bronchogenic cyst of the mediastinum (66 patients) and lung (20 patients). There were 47 women and 39 men whose ages ranged from 16 to 69 years. Seventy-two percent of patients (67% with mediastinal cysts and 90% with cysts of the lung) were symptomatic at the time of operation, and the majority had two or more symptoms. Despite extensive investigations, which in some cases included computed tomographic scanning (n = 12) and angiography (n = 22), a positive diagnosis was never made preoperatively even if it was suspected in 57% of patients. In nearly all patients, the operative approach was that of a posterolateral thoracotomy. All but two mediastinal bronchogenic cysts could be locally excised, but all bronchogenic cysts of the lung required pulmonary resection (lobectomy, 13; limited resection, 6; pneumonectomy, 1). Major operative difficulties were encountered in 35 patients, all of whom were symptomatic preoperatively. Thirty-three patients had a complicated cyst; the complications consisted of fistulization (n = 16), ulcerations of the cyst wall (n = 13), hemorrhage (n = 2), infection without fistulization (n = 1), and secondary bronchial atresia (n = 1). Overall, 82% of patients had a bronchogenic cyst that was either symptomatic or complicated or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV. All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency. There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events. Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients. All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with a ventricular septal defect and aortic incompetence underwent surgical repair. Mean age was 9.6 years (range, 9 to 15 years). Mean follow-up was 32.4 +/- 15.8 months. The ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 19 patients and doubly committed or juxtaarterial in 3. Most showed only a small left-to-right shunt. Mean diameter was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mm. Aortic incompetence was mild in 6 patients, moderate in 4, and severe in 12. In 16 patients closure of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valvoplasty were both performed through the aortic root. There were no deaths. All patients retained normal sinus rhythm. No complete heart block was found. In 3 patients secondary aortic valve replacement was required for severe incompetence; in 1 the cause was bacterial endocarditis, in another technical failure, and in a third progressive incompetence over an 8-month period. All patients showed substantial clinical improvement, marked decrease or disappearance of the valvar incompetence, diminution of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased cardiothoracic ratio. We conclude that primary repair is the operation of choice for this combination of lesions. This can avoid or delay considerably valvar replacement. The left-sided approach proves safe and is our preferred technique.\r"

The resulting myocardial infarction caused significant acute hemodynamic impairment (paired two-tailed t tests), mean pulmonary artery pressure increasing from 7.31 +/- 0.94 to 13.80 +/- 1.19 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increasing from 4.94 +/- 1.03 to 11.13 +/- 1.27 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and directly measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increasing from 9.31 +/- 1.52 to 17.42 +/- 1.82 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after infarction documented with invasive monitoring. There was a hemodynamically significant left ventricular aneurysm (paired two-tailed t tests) in animals studied 3 months later, with increased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 7.20 +/- 1.15 to 13.80 +/- 2.00 mm Hg (p = 0.009), an increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from 4.60 +/- 1.30 to 12.10 +/- 2.06 mm Hg (p = 0.006), and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 11.00 +/- 1.94 mm Hg before infarction to 17.00 +/- 2.69 mm Hg (p = 0.038).

No difference was found among the three groups in terms of actuarial survival and incidence of and freedom from valve-related deaths, thromboemboli, and hemorrhages. Patients with biological prostheses had a significantly greater incidence of structural valve deterioration, reoperations, and overall complications when compared with patients with only mechanical prostheses. The results of an extended follow-up of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement indicate that mechanical prostheses perform better in the long-term owing to their superior durability when compared with biological valves. The use of bioprostheses should be confined to old patients with limited life expectancy because of their cardiac disease, provided that anticoagulants are not used. Combination of mechanical and biological prostheses in the same patient should be avoided because the advantages of each type of prosthesis are lost.\r"

In vivo, we observed a significant threefold to fourfold increase in patient plasma C5a/C5adesArg levels from baseline values (5.6; 1.6 to 12.9 ng/mL) (median and range) up to 42 hours postoperatively (17.5; 6.5 to 46.0 ng/mL) when two different uncoated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits were used. Coating of the extracorporeal circuit with end-point-attached heparin completely abolished C5a formation in vitro during circulation of blood through the circuit for 120 minutes. The C5a concentration (median and range) was 3.2 (2.6 to 15.9) ng/mL at the start and 3.1 (2.7 to 15.0) ng/mL at the end of the experiment. In the uncoated setups the corresponding C5a concentrations were 10.1 (6.2 to 17.5) and 19.7 (13.1 to 24.3) ng/mL. Finally, heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass circuits were examined in vivo. C5a levels did not increase significantly during the cardiopulmonary bypass period in the heparin-coated group in contrast to the uncoated group, but the postoperative increase in C5a levels was similar in the two groups. We conclude that heparin coating improves biocompatibility by completely abolishing C5a formation in vitro. The discrepancy between the in vitro and the in vivo findings is probably related to the complicated biological turnover of C5a.\r"

When all patients with other psychiatric diagnoses and substance abuse were excluded, and marital status controlled for, there was a significant excess of deaths due to verified and undetermined suicides, ie, nearly one third of all deaths. These unnatural deaths preempted any excess in natural causes before the age of 70 years, such as cardiovascular disease. Treatment policy with regard to the use of anxiolytic drugs was not found to influence mortality. We concluded that the risk of suicide in inpatients before the age of 70 years with anxiety disorders may be as high as that in persons with depression or other diagnoses who require inpatient care.\r"

Next, subjects were given 2 days of concurrent access to the two coffees. The relative use of the two coffees was used to assess caffeine self-administration. Reliable caffeine self-administration occurred in three of 10 subjects in study 1 and seven of 12 subjects in study 2. Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, drowsiness, and fatigue. The major adverse effect from self-administration was tremulousness. The occurrence of headaches on substitution of decaffeinated coffee prospectively predicted subsequent self-administration of caffeine. These results indicate that some coffee drinkers exhibit signs of a caffeine dependence, ie, they self-administer coffee for the effects of caffeine, have withdrawal symptoms on cessation, and experience adverse effects.\r"

Patients showed generalized impairment relative to controls and a selective deficit in memory and learning compared with other functions. Selective impairment was not found on tests related to frontal system function (abstraction, verbal fluency, and motor). The observed pattern is consistent with greater involvement of the temporal-hippocampal system, against the background of diffuse dysfunction. Although impairment in memory and learning has been reported, the selectivity and relative severity compared with other behavioral functions have not been recognized. The specificity of this profile merits further examination. These findings lend support to the hypothesized importance of the temporal-hippocampal region in understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\r"

These changes suggest disturbed development. Because the entorhinal cortex is pivotal for neural systems that mediate corticohippocampal interactions, early disruption of its structure could lead to important neuropsychological changes during development and in adult life and could contribute to the symptomatology of schizophrenia.\r"

Among the 73 ADD probands, 24 (33%) met criteria for AFFs (major depression, n = 15 [21%]; bipolar disorder, n = 8 [11%]; and dysthymia, n = 1 [1%]). After stratification of the ADD sample into those with AFFs (ADD + AFF) and those without AFF (ADD), familial risk analyses revealed the following: (1) the relatives of each ADD proband subgroup were at significantly greater risk for ADD than were relatives of normal controls; (2) the age-corrected morbidity risk for ADD was not significantly different between relatives of ADD and ADD + AFF (27% vs 22%); however, these two risks were significantly greater than the risk to relatives of normal controls (5%); (3) the risk for any AFF (bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or dysthymia) was not significantly different between relatives of ADD probands and ADD + AFF probands (28% and 25%), but these two risks were significantly greater than the risk to relatives of normal controls (4%); (4) ADD and AFFs did not cosegregate within families; and (5) there was no evidence for nonrandom mating.

  ".W": "The dopamine hypothesis is one of the major etiological hypotheses of schizophrenia. The well-established role of genetic factors in schizophrenia together with reports of increased D2 dopamine receptor densities in untreated schizophrenic patients support the D2 dopamine receptor gene as a strong candidate gene for schizophrenia. The recent cloning of the D2 dopamine receptor gene made it possible to test the involvement of the D2 dopamine receptor locus (DRD2) in a large Swedish and a smaller Californian schizophrenia pedigree. Using multipoint linkage analysis between schizophrenia and a genetic map that includes the DRD2 locus and assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, we were able to exclude the DRD2 locus with a lod score of -4.14 for the penetrance of 0.72 and with a lod score of -3.05 for the lower bound penetrance of 0.56. The area of exclusion (lod score, less than -2.00) extended 27 centimorgans. These results provide strong evidence against linkage of the D2 dopamine receptor gene region to schizophrenia in the two pedigrees investigated. We conclude that the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia in these pedigrees is not due to aberrations in the DRD2 locus or the porphobilinogen deaminase locus. Our results do not support the D2 dopamine receptor hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, they cannot exclude the possibility that other genes regulating aspects of D2 dopamine expression might be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, such as the expression of two D2 dopamine receptor subtypes by alternative RNA splicing.\r"

In a blinded experiment, DNA from the cerebral cortex was treated with the restriction endonuclease Taql and probed with a 1.5-kilobase (kb) digest of a clone (lambda hD2G1) of the human D2 dopamine receptor gene. The binding characteristics (Kd [binding affinity] and Bmax [number of binding sites]) of the D2 dopamine receptor were determined in the caudate nuclei of these brains using tritiated spiperone as the ligand. The adjusted Kd was significantly lower in alcoholic than in nonalcoholic subjects. In subjects with the A1 allele, in whom a high association with alcoholism was found, the Bmax was significantly reduced compared with the Bmax of subjects with the A2 allele. Moreover, a progressively reduced Bmax was found in subjects with A2/A2, A1/A2, and A1/A1 alleles, with subjects with A2/A2 having the highest mean values, and subjects with A1/A1, the lowest. The polymorphic pattern of the D2 dopamine receptor gene and its differential expression of receptors suggests the involvement of the dopaminergic system in conferring susceptibility to at least one subtype of severe alcoholism.\r"

All subjects had structured psychiatric interviews. Clinical assessment and genotyping were carried out independently. Thirteen (41%) of the 32 alcoholics carried the A1 allele compared with three (12%) of the 25 controls. The association with the A1 allele was significant when controls were compared with a subset of 10 alcoholics with severe medical problems (60% vs 12%), but not less severe cases. However, regardless of clinical severity or subtype, there was no evidence of linkage or cosegregation of the A1 allele and increased susceptibility to alcoholism in informative pedigrees. The possible association in the general population without linkage in families may be explained either by chance variation in our small samples or a modifying effect of the A1 allele that increases severity. Further study of the role of the D2 receptor gene in alcoholism is warranted.\r"

These efforts aim to increase the number of competitive candidates for medical school, particularly those from minority groups underrepresented in medicine. They entail close collaboration between the Baylor administration and faculty from Texas public schools and two-year and four-year colleges and universities. The authors discuss the rationale for these programs and comment about the need for institutional commitments of faculty and financial support. They note that these programs are an investment in the future and that longitudinal assessment is needed to determine their ultimate success.\r"

Making clinical preventive medicine an integral part of a primary care rotation is a central feature of the proposal. The panel presents recommendations for using the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, which assesses the effectiveness of 169 types of prevention interventions, in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Recommendations for incorporating the guide into the undergraduate medical school curriculum are outlined. The recommendations include options for using the guide as part of a curriculum in quantitative skills, in clinical preventive medicine, in a primary care rotation, as a health services and community dimension curriculum, and as part of continuing self-education. Recognizing that teaching methods and curriculum structures are varied in preventive medicine, the panel designed the recommendations to be adaptable to all medical schools' programs. The recommendations are aimed at achieving the goal of making preventive medicine an integral part of the education, training, and practice of physicians.\r"

This paper outlines the panel's recommendations of the types of knowledge and attitudes on which postgraduate medical education in prevention should be built. Detailed recommendations are presented, based on the summary findings of the guide, for residency education in prevention. Implementation of these recommendations will integrate preventive services into the continuum of medical care. These recommendations are presented to achieve the goal of educating physicians to approach the total patient, putting the patient's health rather than the disease process in the forefront of primary medical care.\r"

This article reports the results of a 1989 study of the types of agreements between the letter writers and the residency directors of two schools. Three standard methods of providing comparative information were used in their ranking of 20 graduates from the class of 1987 at each school. Ordinal ranking from best to worst students revealed a surprisingly high degree of rank-order agreement, but only for 15 of the 16 participating residency directors. Clustering into fixed groups (\"top third,\" etc.) gave high agreement for top students but weaker agreement for the middle and lower groupings. The advantages and disadvantages of these evaluation methods are discussed.\r"

Although equally divided between children and adults, the patient population had two large bulges, infants less than 2 years old and young adults aged 18-39 years. Most of the 833 patients (from 406 households) who returned the questionnaires were well educated and professional. They indicated they were aware of the nature of the practice; had been looking for a specialist, not a \"doctor for the family\"; and were highly satisfied. Therefore, the medicine-pediatrics residency program studied appears to have been very successful in preparing primary care physicians. These physicians had a particular appeal to young upper-middle-class families.\r"

The study was designed to identify predictor categories (particular performance characteristics of residents) for the residents' overall performances and their scores in handling critical incidents (those incidents that could or would have caused significant morbidity or mortality had faculty not intervened). More than 9,000 comments made by 163 faculty about 45 residents were analyzed. Residents' noncognitive skills that were predictors of overall performance were Conscientiousness, Management, Confidence, Critical Incidents, and Knowledge. Conscientiousness and Composure predicted two-thirds of the variability in critical incidents' scores. Path analysis verified causal relationships between the hypothesized predictors and critical incidents. For the residents studied, inadequate noncognitive performance in some areas was a powerful (p less than .0005) predictor of overall clinical performance and was related to the occurrence of critical incidents.\r"

Of the 2,033 students who graduated from the HSHP between 1975 and 1987, 951 (46.8%) returned usable responses to the survey. The results raised some concerns about the value of the high school's counseling services and showed that financial barriers posed problems for many students in their pursuit of health-related careers. Also, the results suggest that gender stereotyping may influence the students' career choices. Overall, however, the results of the survery were clearly favorable and provide evidence that the HSHP has been successful in fostering its students' pursuit of careers in the health professions and related careers.\r"

As seniors, those who chose EM had the highest debt of seniors going into any specialty. However, the mean peak income they expected was higher than that expected by the other nonsurgeons, although it was below that expected by the surgeons. The EM group compared favorably with those who chose other specialties in terms of their academic records and had the highest mean Part III score on the National Board of Medical Examiners examination of any of the groups studied. The students who chose EM also indicated their great willingness to see patients from low-income households, and were willing to spend more of their practice time serving these groups than were the students who chose the other specialties. The authors discuss these findings as related to the nature of EM and medical school graduates' choices of specialties.\r"

To determine if genetic differences associated with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system account for racial variation in hypertensive renal failure, we examined antigenic frequencies from a large renal transplant registry. Human Leukocyte Antigen phenotypes from cadaveric renal transplant recipients and donors in the South Eastern Organ Procurement Foundation database from 1982 to 1986 were analyzed. One thousand six hundred four renal transplant recipients with hypertensive renal failure as the cause of end stage renal disease (cases) were compared with 4506 race-matched cadaveric kidney donors (controls). Log-linear models were used to assess the relationship between hypertensive renal failure and prevalence of each HLA phenotype. Bonferroni adjustments of P values were used to correct for multiple comparisons. Comparison of HLA frequencies between blacks and whites with hypertensive renal failure demonstrated that blacks had an increased frequency of HLA-DR3 beyond that normally known to exist between black and white populations. Black cases compared to black controls had an 8.6% increase in HLA-DR3 frequency contrasted with a 1.6% decrease in the frequency of this antigen between white cases and white controls. This absolute 10.2% difference between the races was significant (P = .02) because the control black and white populations had nearly identical frequencies for this antigen. White cases compared to white controls had lower HLA-A1 and B8 frequencies (21.2% v 30.6%, P = .0005 and 13.7% v 22.3%, P = .001, respectively) and a greater HLA-B35 frequency (20.7% v 14.2%, P = .02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intestinal calcium absorption has been shown to be decreased in rats with spontaneous hypertension, but it has not been studied in patients with essential hypertension. In these studies we have for the first time measured intestinal absorption of calcium (using oral and intravenous administration of 47Ca), along with other parameters of calcium metabolism, in 14 patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function and in 16 normal subjects. There was no difference in serum total or ionized calcium, serum phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D(24,25(OH)2D) among hypertensives and normotensives. The urinary excretion of calcium, on the other hand, was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (195 +/- 33 v 107 +/- 13 mg/24 h, P less than .05). There was also no difference in intestinal absorption of calcium after 2 and 24 h among hypertensives and normotensives. When hypertensive patients were stratified according to plasma renin activity (PRA) we found that patients with low PRA had higher intestinal absorption of calcium at 2 h (23 +/- 2.9 v 18 +/- 0.6%, P less than .05) but not at 24 h. Serum total and ionized calcium, PTH, and 1,25(OH)2D were not different between patients with low and those with normal-high PRA. The major derangement of calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension is hypercalciuria. This abnormality is more pronounced in patients with low PRA, and it may lead to increased vitamin D-dependent intestinal absorption of calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary salt restriction is the most common therapeutic recommendation given to hypertensives, but past studies have assessed the effect of salt restriction using resting blood pressure (BP) measurements not with the newer technique of 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. We compared the effect of high (250 mEq Na/day) and low (10 mEq Na/day) salt diets on resting versus ambulatory BP in 12 normal and 15 hypertensive subjects. Each diet was given for 7 days. Ambulatory BP was monitored from day 6 to day 7 of each diet; resting supine BP was measured on the morning of day 8. In normal subjects, neither resting nor ambulatory BP changed with sodium restriction. In hypertensives, resting BP fell 14 +/- 3/6 +/- 2 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic; P less than .01 for both) with sodium restriction while ambulatory BP fell only 4 +/- 2/2 +/- 2 (P = NS). The resting BP fall was significantly greater than the ambulatory BP fall (P less than .05) for both systolic and diastolic pressure. Ambulatory heart rates were also significantly greater during sodium restriction, suggesting that the low salt diet activated the sympathetic nervous system. This may, in turn, have partially offset the hypotensive effect of sodium restriction. We conclude that using resting BP to assess the effect of sodium restriction may overestimate the efficacy of this therapy. Ambulatory BP monitoring should be employed in future studies of sodium restriction.\r"

  ".W": "Published observations suggest that not everyone benefits from severe dietary NaCl restriction, since blood pressure responses appear heterogeneous and adverse metabolic effects may occur. We studied the cardiovascular, neurohumoral, and metabolic effects of 7 day periods of 20 v 200 mEq/day NaCl diets in 27 men. Twelve subjects were salt sensitive (SS), defined as mean intraarterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) during high NaCl greater than or equal to 5% above MAP on low NaCl. Eleven subjects were salt resistant (SR), defined as MAP during the low NaCl phase greater than or equal to MAP during the high NaCl phase. The SR subset had a tendency to greater neurohumoral activity, assessed by changes in mean values for plasma norepinephrine (NE, P = .12) and plasma renin activity (PRA, P less than .001) on the low v high NaCl diet. In SR subjects the low v high NaCl diet also raised mean values for creatinine (P = .03), uric acid (P = .001), and low density cholesterol (LDL-C, P = .03), but not fasting insulin (P = .15). In SS subjects, the low v high NaCl diet did not raise NE (P = .35), although the PRA was greater (P = .002). Among SS subjects, mean values for uric acid (P = .005) and insulin (P = .02) were greater during the low v high NaCl phase, while creatinine (P = .15) and LDL-C (P = .67) were not different. The data suggest that severe, short-term NaCl restriction can be undesirable, especially in SR subjects, since potentially adverse neurohumoral and metabolic changes are not counterbalanced by the benefits of a lower MAP.\r"

The sample comprised 860 men and 1140 women with an average age of 55 years. Analysis of variance showed highly statistically significant negative correlations for all blood pressure values between different noon temperature, as well as mean daily temperature, groups. The greatest difference for systolic blood pressure was 7 mm Hg, and for diastolic blood pressure it was 3 mm Hg, within the -24 degrees C to 27 degrees C temperature range. The same relationship between blood pressure and different environmental temperatures was also seen when the blood pressure recordings were divided between temperature below 0 degree C and above 0 degree C, ie, within the winter or summer months. This environmental effect may have a clinically significant impact because thermosensitivity appears to be related to hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Caffeine produces an acute increase in blood pressure in the research laboratory, but its effect on the ambulatory blood pressure during normal daily activities is unknown. In 25 normotensive, caffeine-naive subjects, daily administration of 400 mg caffeine produced a small increase (+3/+3 mm Hg, P less than .001) in ambulatory daytime blood pressure on the first day, with values returning to baseline by the third day. The initial rise in blood pressure was associated with a fall in heart rate (-3 beats/min, P less than .02). Readings taken the morning following the first day of caffeine ingestion did not show any persistent effect of caffeine on blood pressure. A 400 mg dose of caffeine causes a small increase in daytime ambulatory blood pressure, but tolerance develops with daily caffeine consumption. Infrequent ingestion of caffeine may cause a transient rise in blood pressure which is unlikely to be harmful to an individual but might influence the diagnosis of hypertension in a patient with a borderline elevated blood pressure.\r"

The significance of these changes in the absence of chest pain or other manifestations of ischemia is not known. To determine if these T-wave inversions are due to myocardial ischemia, we obtained electrocardiograms and left ventricular wall motion studies (2-D echocardiography) before and 1 h after rapid blood pressure reduction with nifedipine in 23 severe hypertensives. One hour after 10 mg nifedipine blood pressure was markedly reduced from 189 +/- 6/117 +/- 3 (mean +/- SE) to 151 +/- 5/91 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than .001). New T-wave inversions developed in 6 of 23 (26%) subjects, but blinded evaluation of 2-D echocardiograms revealed no new wall motion abnormalities. Wall motion score, which at pretreatment was abnormal in 11 of 23 patients, improved significantly after nifedipine from 1.4 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 (P less than .05). Therefore, rapid and marked reduction of blood pressure with nifedipine is accompanied by a high incidence of asymptomatic T-wave inversions which are not accompanied by left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, suggesting that significant myocardial ischemia did not occur.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments were designed to assess the ability of the new nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist DuP 753 to inhibit the binding and, particularly, to antagonize the cellular response to angiotensin II in human platelets and primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). The binding of 125I-angiotensin II was competitively inhibited by DuP 753 with a 50% binding inhibition (IC50) of 5 to 6 x 10(-8) mol/L in platelets and 1 x 10(-8) mol/L in vascular SMC as compared to an IC50 of 5 to 7.5 x 10(-9) mol/L with nonlabeled angiotensin II. In vascular SMC, DuP 753 completely abolished the effects of angiotensin II on 45CaCl2 efflux and 45CaCl2 uptake. Moreover, in these latter cells, DuP 753 prevented the angiotensin II but not the vasopressin induced increase in cytosolic calcium. These results demonstrate that DuP 753 competes with angiotensin II binding to its receptor in both animal and human cells and selectively blocks the cellular response to angiotensin II.\r"

From these measures, we estimated an 83% increase in the duration of blood transit through the cortical capillary network of renal hypertensive rats, a new expression of altered microvascular function in the brain of this hypertensive model. The rate of glucose utilization in the cerebral cortex of renal hypertensive animals was not different from that observed for normotensive animals.

Moreover, in the absence of vascular endothelium, bradykinin also inhibits norepinephrine efflux from the sympathetic nerve terminals innervating these blood vessels. This inhibition is attenuated by canavanine and LNMMA, which inhibit the conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, and is enhanced after overnight incubation of blood vessels with arginine. In endothelium-rubbed blood vessels the inhibitory effect of bradykinin on norepinephrine efflux is enhanced by increasing extracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]o) and attenuated by nitrendipine. We propose that bradykinin inhibits norepinephrine efflux by stimulating intraneuronal nitric oxide from arginine.\r"

PHF produced a delayed increase in blood pressure with a peak response at 45 min (bolus injection) or 60 to 90 min (continuous infusion). This increase in blood pressure was coupled with an in vitro increase in calcium uptake in rat tail artery with a similar time course. The involvement of calcium in the mechanism of action was supported by the inhibitory effect of calcium antagonists on the vascular action of PHF. Furthermore, PHF increased the intracellular free calcium concentration in cultured smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. Parathyroidectomy and parathyroid transplant experiments indicated the parathyroid origin of PHF. A culture of parathyroid glands from SHR, but not from normotensive rats, produced in the medium a factor which has the same biological property and HPLC retention time as plasma PHF. A novel cell type was described in the parathyroid gland of SHR, but not normotensive rats, and the percent of these cells correlated significantly with plasma PHF level and blood pressure. In some hyperparathyroid patients, plasma PHF and hypertension were found, both of which disappeared after surgical removal of the parathyroid gland. In both animal models and human studies, PHF seems to be associated with low or normal plasma renin and salt-sensitive type of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The immune system has been extensively evaluated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The central role of the T-helper (CD4) cell in the immunopathogenesis of AIDS and the immunologic markers that can predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression have been described. However, the potential influence of suppressor cells in this disease process has not been clearly addressed. Spontaneous suppressor cell activity (SSCA) was evaluated in 78 patients with documented HIV infection at different clinical stages of disease progression. Higher levels of SSCA were found in patients with clinical AIDS less than 6 months and those dying of AIDS when compared with controls. Significant elevations (p less than 0.05) of SSCA were seen in patients newly diagnosed with AIDS, and those having AIDS greater than 6 months and less than one year. Patients surviving AIDS for greater than one year had depressed levels of SSCA compared to controls. Furthermore, SSCA appears to predict disease progression as patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) with elevations in SSCA progressed to AIDS while those with blunted SSCA did not progress. The level of SSCA in these patients was able to predict disease progression (p = 0.00016, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.739). Patients with documented AIDS were also followed prospectively, and the level of SSCA was shown to be predictive of mortality (p = 0.009, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.746). It is concluded that SSCA is a valid predictor of disease progression, and can serve as a prognostic indicator of disease outcome.\r"

To find the most therapeutically potent combination of CD4 and PE four different hybrid toxins composed of one [CD4(122)] or two [CD4(181)] Ig-like CD4 domains and sequences of PE where the binding domain was partially [PE(392)] or completely [PE(364)] removed were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The number of CD4 domains determined the binding affinity to gp120 and in cell viability assays the window between specific and nonspecific cytotoxicity. The length of PE determined the potency of the drug. The optimal hybrid toxin was composed of two Ig-like domains of CD4 and PE(392). Investigation of the internalization mechanism of CD4-PE revealed that the hybrid toxin binds to target cells and is endocytosed within one hour. However, more than 6 hours are required for maximum translation inhibition. In contrast to PE which is inhibited by ammonium chloride treatment, cell toxicity of CD4-PE is not affected by ammonium chloride. Further investigations showed that the acid-induced hydrophobicity change which is required for membrane translocation is also observed with CD4-PE but at significantly higher pH than with PE.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the degree of variation of HIV-1 env genes isolated from seven individuals with hemophilia B who became infected in association with administration of a suspected clotting factor lot. Two hypervariable regions and part of a constant region from proviral DNA of the peripheral blood leukocytes of these patients were amplified and the products of the polymerase chain reactions were sequenced. The sequences derived from five of the individuals displayed 100% sequence homology, 1 had two and 1 had six deviations from the consensus sequence. The alignment of the amino acid sequence so deduced revealed no comparable homology to any of these two hypervariable regions from a number of published isolates. The genetic variability of HIV-1 seems to be limited, at least in the early phase of infection, allowing the determination of close relationships between epidemiologically related strains.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow stromal cells influence hematopoiesis through cell-cell interaction and release of hematopoietic growth factors. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is constitutively produced by several murine and human stromal cell lines and is induced by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 alpha or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in a variety of mesenchymal cells. Other potentially important regulatory molecules such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), released by activated monocytes in response to inflammation, stimulate the growth of human stromal cells. However, the effect of these peptide mitogens on M-CSF expression in stromal cells has not been explored. In this study, we used TC-1 murine bone marrow-derived stromal cells that constitutively secrete M-CSF to determine the effect of PDGF and bFGF on cell proliferation and M-CSF gene expression. PDGF and bFGF, but not TNF-alpha, were potent mitogens for the TC-1 cells. Similar to mouse L cells, TC-1 murine stromal cells constitutively expressed two major mRNA transcripts of 4.4 and 2.2 kb that hybridized to a murine M-CSF cDNA. PDGF, bFGF, and TNF-alpha markedly stimulated the steady-state expression of M-CSF mRNA with different time-course kinetics. The increased expression of M-CSF mRNA was associated with enhanced secretion of M-CSF as determined by radioimmunoassay. These findings suggest that PDGF, bFGF, and TNF-alpha may regulate hematopoiesis indirectly through release of M-CSF by stromal cells and may modulate, at least in part, the hematopoietic response to inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous factors that can influence the proliferation and differentiation in vitro of cells at various stages of hematopoiesis have been identified, but the mechanisms used by stromal cells to regulate the cycling status of the most primitive human hematopoietic cells are still poorly understood. Previous studies of long-term cultures (LTC) of human marrow have suggested that cytokine-induced variations in stromal cell production of one or more stimulators and inhibitors of hematopoiesis may be important. To identify the specific regulators involved, we performed Northern analyses on RNA extracted from human marrow LTC adherent layers, or stromal cell types derived from or related to those present in the adherent layer. These analyses showed marked increases in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mRNA levels within 8 hours after treatments that lead to the activation within 2 days of primitive hematopoietic progenitors in such cultures. Increases in granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF and M-CSF mRNA were also sometimes seen. Bioassays using cell lines responsive to G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 showed significant elevation in growth factor levels 24 hours after IL-1 beta stimulation. Neither IL-3 nor IL-4 mRNA was detectable at any time. In contrast, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA and nanogram levels of TGF-beta bioactivity in the medium were detected at all times in established LTC, and these levels were not consistently altered by any of the manipulations that stimulated hematopoietic growth factor production and primitive progenitor cycling. We also found that addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody could prolong or reactivate primitive progenitor proliferation when added to previously stimulated or quiescent cultures, respectively. Together, these results indicate a dominant negative regulatory role of endogenously produced TGF-beta in unperturbed LTC, with activation of primitive hematopoietic cells being achieved by mechanisms that stimulate stromal cells to produce G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6. Given the similarities between the LTC system and the marrow microenvironment, it seems likely that the control of human stem cell activation in vivo may involve similar variations in the production of these factors by stromal cells.\r"

  ".U": "91300044\r", 
  ".W": "Inhibition of prothrombinase by antithrombin III (ATIII) and heparin was investigated in a continuous-flow system. Phospholipid-coated capillaries, containing phospholipid-bound factor Xa and factor Va, were perfused with 1.0 mumol/L prothrombin and 0.5 nmol/L factor Va. At 25 degrees C and a flow rate of 32 microL/min (shear rate 28 seconds-1) the steady-state rates of prothrombin conversion depended linearly on the surface concentration of prothrombinase up to 2 fmol/cm2. The rate of thrombin generation was 952 +/- 43 (SE) mol/min/mol prothrombinase. When ATIII was included in the perfusate for 10 minutes, the free thrombin concentration at the outlet of the capillary was markedly reduced: a 50% neutralization was obtained at 0.7 mumol/L ATIII. However, the prothrombinase activity was not inhibited, as could be established after a subsequent perfusion with prothrombin and factor Va. At an ATIII concentration typical of normal plasma (2 mumol/L) a slight neutralization of prothrombinase was observed: 10% neutralization following a 10-minute perfusion. During a perfusion with ATIII in the absence of prothrombin, or in its presence with hirudin (2 mumol/L) also included in the perfusate, a more pronounced neutralization of prothrombinase was observed: 40% residual activity was obtained after a 10-minute perfusion. From this observation the suggestion comes forward that thrombin, continuously produced at the surface, consumes ATIII in the boundary layer. In this case the true ATIII concentration in the vicinity of surface-bound prothrombinase will be but a small fraction of the initial ATIII concentration in the bulk fluid. Unfractionated heparin and an ultra-low molecular weight heparin (pentasaccharide) did enhance the ATIII-dependent neutralization of prothrombinase, but to a much lesser extent than observed with small unilaminar phospholipid vesicles as the catalytic sites for prothrombinase assembly. The findings reported here support the notion that regulation of prothrombinase by heparin under in vivo conditions occurs at the stage of its formation, ie, through inhibition of free factor Xa and/or the generation of factor Va, rather than by direct inhibition of the prothrombinase activity.\r"

A 47-year-old man with no clinical bleeding tendency was found to have undetectable plasma FVII activity when tested in a one-stage assay using rabbit brain TF, but 0.3 U/mL using recombinant human TF and 1.04 U/mL FVII antigen. Variant FVII purified from his plasma showed an identical migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to wild-type zymogen. By enzyme kinetic analysis the Km of the variant using FX as a substrate was 12-fold higher than that of normal FVII. Also, the variant FVII was unable to compete with wild-type FVII for limited rabbit TF binding sites. A ligand blot procedure was used to directly demonstrate reduced binding of recombinant human TF to the variant FVII compared with normal FVII. Genetic analysis of leukocyte DNA showed a G to A mutation in the propositus' gene at codon 304 that results in the substitution of a glutamine for an arginine residue in the catalytic domain of the protease. We conclude that this region of the FVII molecule is important for its function.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that reduced glomerular adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) activity within the rat kidney is associated with an increased thrombotic tendency. To establish a possible causal relationship between these intraglomerular events, experiments were conducted to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP) degradation without influencing other glomerular prothrombotic or antithrombotic mechanisms. Concurrently, we studied intraglomerular platelet aggregation. Two ways of selective inhibition of glomerular ADPase activity were applied: (1) by competitive substrates (ie, uridine diphosphate [UDP]), and (2) by the nondegradable ADP analogue ADP-beta-S. Both strategies were used during ex vivo alternate perfusion of kidneys with platelets and ADP (to test intraglomerular thrombotic tendency). Each group (n = 6) received different substrates or a combination of substrates. A significant increase in platelet aggregation was observed in kidneys after perfusion with platelets and ADP together with the competitive substrate UDP as compared to perfusions with platelets and ADP alone (78.5% +/- 9.8% v 27.9% +/- 11.4% glomeruli staining positive for platelets, P less than .005). In contrast, UDP alone had no effect on platelet aggregation. Other nucleoside polyphosphates (guanosine diphosphate and inosine triphosphate) were also effective as competitive substrates in the ex vivo perfusion model (n = 4). None of these substrates was capable of increasing ADP-induced aggregation when studied in vitro. In addition, ADP- beta-S also increased platelet aggregation in the perfusion model as compared with native ADP (P less than .005). These results show that selective reduction of ADP degradation in intact kidneys strongly promotes the intraglomerular proaggregatory condition. It can be concluded that glomerular ADPase exerts potent antithrombotic activity within the normal rat kidney.\r"

  ".W": "A new case of heterozygous dysfibrinogenemia characterized by an amino acid replacement in the NH2-terminal region of the fibrin alpha-chain was found in a 27-year-old woman with a bleeding problem. Her one-stage prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were slightly prolonged, and the purified fibrinogen from this patient had a markedly prolonged thrombin or reptilase time. Release of fibrinopeptides A and B was normal, but the polymerization of fibrin monomers was impaired. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified fibrinogen under the reduced condition showed no abnormalities in the apparent molecular weights of its three chains. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the lysylendopeptidase-cleaved purified A alpha-chains showed a decrease in one peptide compared with the normal amount and the appearance of an abnormal peptide peak. These peptides were treated with thrombin and further separated on HPLC. Amino acid sequence analysis of the abnormal peptide indicated that A alpha proline-18, the second residue from the NH2-terminus of the fibrin alpha-chain, was replaced by leucine. The synthetic peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro inhibited both thrombin- and reptilase-induced fibrin aggregation, but Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro showed little or no inhibition under the same conditions. The discovery of this abnormal fibrinogen supports the findings that A alpha proline-18 is important as part of the polymerization site in the NH2-terminus of the fibrin alpha-chain. The propositus' mother had the same abnormal fibrinogen. This unique inherited abnormal fibrinogen was designated as fibrinogen Kyoto II.\r"

The prothrombotic erythrocyte effects were metabolically regulated, as evidenced by lack of activity of ATP-depleted or glutaraldehyde-fixed erythrocytes. They occurred in the absence of cell lysis as verified by lactate dehydrogenase assays, and had an absolute requirement for platelet activation. The presence of erythrocytes induced a twofold increase in platelet thromboxane B2 (TXB2) synthesis upon collagen stimulation, indicating that erythrocytes modulated platelet eicosanoid formation. Cell-free releasates from stimulated platelet-erythrocyte suspensions, which exhibited increased recruiting capacity, contained 6.9-fold more ADP and 4.9-fold more ATP than releasates from stimulated platelets alone. Following aspirin ingestion, TXB2 formation was blocked, but erythrocyte promotion of platelet reactivity persisted at those doses of collagen that reinduced platelet activation. Moreover, when platelet mixtures consisted of as little as 10% obtained before aspirin plus 90% obtained post-aspirin ingestion, significant erythrocyte enhancement of platelet reactivity occurred, even at low agonist concentrations. These erythrocyte effects would decrease the therapeutic potential of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by aspirin. The erythrocyte-induced modulation of platelet biochemistry and function emphasizes the importance of cell-cell interactions in stimulus-response coupling.\r"

  ".W": "Various abnormalities of lymphokine production have been described in patients with aplastic anemia. To determine if abnormal production of hematopoietic growth factors could contribute to the process of aplastic anemia we studied the in vitro production of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- and antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from 29 patients with aplastic anemia and 15 normal controls. GM-CSF production in response to 1% PHA was seen in nearly all samples (43 of 44) and similar amounts of GM-CSF were produced by patients with aplastic anemia and normal controls. Production of GM-CSF by ATG-stimulated lymphocytes was seen in 7 of 23 patients with aplastic anemia (30%); two of these patients also demonstrated low-level spontaneous production of GM-CSF. Production of GM-CSF in response to ATG was also seen in 2 of 11 normal controls (18%) and barely detectable spontaneous production of GM-CSF was seen in both. Biologically active IL-3 could also be detected in PHA- or ATG-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in several patients and normal controls. Our results indicate that lymphocytes from patients with aplastic anemia can be stimulated in vitro to produce normal quantities of GM-CSF, suggesting that impaired potential for production of T-cell derived hematopoietic growth factors is unlikely to account for the marrow hypoplasia seen. In several patients overproduction of GM-CSF was observed, consistent with the notion that some patients with aplastic anemia may have circulating activated T cells. We also demonstrate that ATG can stimulate the production of growth factors such as IL-3 and GM-CSF, supporting the role for ATG in stimulating hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we showed that mononuclear cells from about half of human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-seropositive persons exhibit spontaneous proliferation in vitro. We sought to determine if proliferation was associated with other immunologic changes characteristic of HTLV infection. The parameters assessed were (1) percentages of lymphocytes expressing CD4 and/or CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor), (2) serum levels of soluble CD25, (3) serostatus for other viruses, (4) anti-HTLV antibody levels, and (5) HTLV type determined by polymerase chain reaction or serologic reactivity with type-specific peptides. The proliferation+ HTLV (PROL+) group, proliferation HTLV (PROL-) group, and control group showed similar percentages of CD4+, CD25+, and CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes; serum levels of soluble CD25 were also similar. Antibodies to cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B core, and hepatitis C were present in similar proportions of PROL+ and PROL+ groups. However, a significant association was found between spontaneous proliferation and anti-HTLV antibody levels; sera from 67% of PROL+ persons, but only 18% of PROL- persons, required dilution to yield absorbance values within the linear range of the anti-HTLV antibody assay. In the PROL+ group, persons whose sera required the most dilution had proliferative responses significantly higher than those whose sera required no dilution. The PROL+ and PROL groups were similar with regard to the relative distribution of HTLV-I and HTLV-II infection. These findings indicate that HTLV-related spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation is related to levels of circulating anti-HTLV antibodies, and characterizes both HTLV-I and HTLV-II infection.\r"

B-cell immune dysfunction contributes significantly to HIV-related morbidity and also represents an obstacle to eventual definitive treatment by anti-HIV immunization. Our laboratory has recently identified in normal B-cell populations certain VH gene subfamilies with a developmentally regulated pattern of utilization. In particular, B cells bearing rearranged VH3L were rare in the germinal center but uniformly abundant in the blood and lymphoid mantle zone. We used this index gene subfamily as a clonal criterion for the pattern of B-cell development in lymphocytes of HIV-positive individuals. In a series of 19 HIV-positive subjects, a striking deficit of VH3L B cells was observed; in contrast, none of the 16 normal subjects showed this abnormality. Other VH subfamilies (VH1N, VH4/6, and VH5N) were unaffected in the HIV-positive patients. This VH3L clonal deficit and other recent phenotype and histopathologic findings suggest that the general B-cell dysfunction in HIV is due to a discreet maturational arrest at the germinal center stage.\r"

  ".W": "The c-myc gene plays a pivotal role in mediating the competence state for cell cycle transversion. This biologic role is in contradiction to reports of elevated expression of the gene in multiple myeloma, a tumor with restricted self-renewal capacity. To more clearly define the role of this gene in plasma cells of myeloma patients, c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or oncoprotein expression were semiquantitatively analyzed on the single cell level in 19 cases of multiple myeloma, among them 1 biclonal case and 1 case with coexistent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Performing anti-sense/mRNA in situ hybridization, mature c-myc gene transcripts were detected in 92% (12 of 13) of cases and could definitely be attributed to the plasma cells by our study. The number of Ki 67-positive plasma cells actively passing the cell cycle was less than 1% and independent of c-myc gene expression. However, because the presence of the 152-c-MYC epitope was correlated to extent of marrow plasmacytosis (r = .64; P = .043) and content of plasmablasts (P = .09), the c-myc gene might serve a function different from proliferative activity, but also associated with tumor cell mass. In CLL cells (21 of 22 cases) and their benign counterparts, ie, bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, the anti-sense/c-myc mRNA hybridization signals remained below the threshold considered as cutpoint between negative and positive. The low amounts of c-myc transcripts were correlated to neither stage of disease (P = .52) nor lymphocyte counts (P = .24). Because the numbers of peripheral blood lymphoma cells were independent of tumor mass and of c-myc gene transcripts expressed, peripheral blood lymphocytosis might more likely reflect homing processes than proliferative activity in CLL.\r"

  ".U": "91300055\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the effects of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 on the growth of leukemic blasts from 40 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Patients were selected on the basis of negativity for a series of B-cell antigens including CD10 and CD19. Twenty-one cases were CD34-positive (CD34+) (greater than 15% of blasts) and the remaining 19 were CD34-negative (CD34-) (less than 3% of blasts). IL-4 alone (100 U/ml) could stimulate either DNA synthesis (with greater than 2.0 stimulation index) or leukemic blast colony formation in 24 of 40 AML patients. In the presence of other growth factors, IL-4 showed divergent effects on IL-3-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-, or erythropoietin-dependent colony formation. These effects of IL-4 were observed in both CD34+ and CD34- AML cases. IL-6 (100 U/mL) alone could not stimulate DNA synthesis and blast colony formation except for one CD34+ case. On the other hand, IL-6 showed synergistic effects on IL-3- and IL-4-dependent blast colony formation in 10 of 12 and 7 of 9 CD34+ AML cases, respectively. Among CD34- AML cases, such synergism was seen only in 1 of 12 cases for IL-3-dependent colony formation and in 3 of 7 cases for IL-4-dependent colony formation. The divergent effect of IL-4 and the synergistic effect of IL-6 were also observed in purified CD34+ leukemic blast populations, indicating that these phenomena are not mediated by accessory cells. The present study suggests that IL-4, alone or in combination with other growth factors, has divergent effects on the growth of AML progenitors irrespective of the CD34 expression, and that IL-6 acts synergistically with IL-3 or IL-4 on the growth of leukemic progenitors preferentially in CD34+ AML.\r"

Fibrinogen represents one of those molecules, being essential in hemostasis, thrombosis, and platelet aggregation. To study whether fibrinogen is endocytosed by megakaryocytes and packaged into alpha-granules or newly synthesized by these cells, we established a highly sensitive nested primer polymerase chain reaction for the detection of human fibrinogen gamma-chain mRNA. In enriched megakaryocyte fractions, as well as fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified megakaryocytes from bone marrow samples of healthy volunteers, no fibrinogen gamma-chain mRNA could be detected, despite the presence of the corresponding fibrinogen gamma-chain DNA. We conclude that fibrinogen gamma-chain mRNA, as detectable by our amplification system, is missing in megakaryocytes. This finding suggests that fibrinogen might be acquired from plasma by endocytosis and sequestered in alpha-granules before reentering the circulation after platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its relationships with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a study was undertaken by the Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique. Thirty-five Ph- CML patients were investigated and compared with 55 chronic phase Ph+ CML and 100 CMML patients. There were 12 M-BCR positive (M-BCR+) and 23 M-BCR negative (MBCR+) patients. No clinical or biologic differences were found between Ph+ and Ph-, M-BCR+ patients. In the Ph- group, M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients differed significantly in age (47.7 +/- 6.6 v 67.0 +/- 6.1 years, respectively; P = .001), leukocytosis (153.4 +/- 135.1 v 58.5 +/- 37.7 10(9)/L, P = .002), relative monocytosis (1.8% +/- 1.2% v 5.6% +/- 1.4%, P = .048), absolute basophilia (8.5 +/- 9.7 v 0.9 +/- 1.5 10(9)/L, P = .001), percentage of immature myeloid precursors (IMP) in peripheral blood (29.0% +/- 9.5% v 15.3% +/- 8.1%, P = .001), and percentage of erythroblasts in bone marrow (BM) (6.5% +/- 3.5% v 14.6% +/- 3.6%, P = .001). Karyotypic abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome occurred in 0 of 12 M-BCR- at diagnosis and 7 of 23 M-BCR- Ph- CML (P = .033). None of the 13 investigated BCR- patients had detectable BCR/ABL transcripts using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and none had an N-RAS mutation. Cytologic findings showed a marked morphologic difference between M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients, especially in the monocytic lineage. Dysmyelopoietic features in CMML and M-BCR- patients were very similar, and the differences were of quantitative order only. Using four criteria (monocytosis, percentage of IMP, basophilia, and percentage of erythroblasts in BM), patients could be divided into typical and atypical CML and this classification correlated well with molecular findings. We conclude that, while Ph-, M-BCR+, and Ph+ CML are identical diseases, Ph-, M-BCR- CML, and CMML have many similarities and might be only different aspects of a same entity.\r"

  ".U": "91300058\r", 
  ".W": "A rationale for clinical trials of hydroxyurea (HU) treatment in sickle cell disease is that the agent increases red blood cell (RBC) fetal hemoglobin content. However, an additional effect of HU is to raise the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). To investigate the action of HU in a species that makes no electrophoretically distinguishable fetal hemoglobin, we treated dogs with the drug and compared their response to that of five patients with sickle cell anemia. Both dogs and patients had an increase in MCV, but the effect of HU treatment on the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), density, and water content of the RBCs differed in the two species. The dog RBCs became low in MCHC, high in ion and water content, and low in mean density. Thus, HU can raise MCV and lower MCHC without influencing fetal hemoglobin synthesis. A different pattern was seen in the sickle cell patients during HU treatment. Although the MCV of their RBCs increased, there was no change in MCHC, ion content, or mean density. A notable change in the sickle cell patients' blood was that two subpopulations of cells were nearly eliminated during HU treatment; the hypodense reticulocyte fraction and the hyperdense fraction that contains irreversibly sickled cells. These findings lead us to suggest that trials of HU in sickle cell disease must recognize the possibility that any beneficial effect of this agent might be due not only to an increase in hemoglobin F alone, but perhaps also to the associated increase in MCV or the altered RBC density profile.\r"

  ".U": "91300059\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that young normal (AA) and sickle cell anemia (SS) red blood cells are capable of a volume regulatory decrease response (VRD) driven by a K:Cl cotransporter that is activated by low pH or hypotonic conditions. We now report on the characteristics of young SS cells (SS2, discocytes) capable of rapid increase in density in response to swelling. We have isolated cells with high VRD response (H-VRD) and low VRD response (L-VRD) cells by incubation and density-gradient centrifugation under hypotonic conditions. Comparison of these cells in patients homozygous for hemoglobin (Hb)S indicated that H-VRD cells have 91% more reticulocytes (P less than 9 x 10(-9) than L-VRD cells, 25% less HbF (P less than 5.5 x 10(-5), 106% more NEM (N-methylmaleimide)-stimulated K:Cl cotransport activity (P less than 2 x 10(-4), and 86% more volume-stimulated K:Cl cotransport activity (P less than 1.8 x 10(-3). H-VRD and L-VRD cells have similar G-6-PD and Na+/H+ antiport activity. In agreement with the reduced percent HbF in H-VRD cells, F cells (red blood cells that contain fetal Hb) are depleted from the H-VRD population; however, F reticulocytes are enriched in the H-VRD population to the same extent as non-F reticulocytes, which suggests that both F and non-F reticulocytes have a similar initial distribution of volume-sensitive K:Cl cotransport activity but that it may be more rapidly inactivated in F than in S reticulocytes. We find that H-VRD cells consist of 20% reticulocytes (or 79% of all reticulocytes in SS2) and 80% more mature cells. This study demonstrates the role of K:Cl cotransport in determining red blood cell density, the heterogeneity of K:Cl cotransport activity in reticulocytes, and the capacity for rapid change in the density of reticulocytes with high K:Cl cotransport activity. We speculate that the H-VRD population may be more susceptible to generation of dense and irreversibly sickled cells.\r"

In a nonimmune individual, serum antibody reactivity to surface antigens of infected cells was acquired during convalescence, as tested by all five methods, and was generally parasite isolate-specific. By contrast, adult hyperimmune West African sera reacted with many isolates, including isolates from geographically distinct regions. A quantitative correlation was established between agglutination and surface immunofluorescence assay titers, and between surface immunofluorescence assay and immunoEM reactivity, suggesting that a single antigen or a set of coexpressed antigens is being detected. Surface iodination of infected cells identified trypsin-sensitive high M, antigens in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extract. All sera tested that agglutinated infected cells also immunoprecipitated these antigens. The same surface antigens were immunoprecipitated by the homologous convalescent serum as by adult sera. By immunoEM these antigens were localized exclusively at the knob-like protrusions of infected cells, where they may participate in adherence to vascular endothelium.\r"

We reconstituted four cats that had been lethally irradiated with autologous bone marrow that had been infected with the N2 or SAX retroviral vector. Bone marrow cells from all four cats expressed the neoR gene 30 days posttransplant and three of four cats still had the neoR gene and a low level of drug resistant colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage after more than 200 days. Two of the four cats unexpectedly developed diabetes mellitus 90 days posttransplantation. The expression of a foreign gene in cats, albeit at a low level, demonstrates that retroviral vectors can be used for gene transfer in noninbred large animal species and may be useful for gene therapy of humans. The development of diabetes mellitus in two of the subjects emphasizes the value of animal models for the study of possible deleterious effects of retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer.\r"

Eligible patients included CMV-seronegative patients undergoing autologous transplant or seronegative patients undergoing allogeneic transplant for aplastic anemia or non-hematologic malignancy who had seronegative marrow donors. Patients and marrow donors were serologically screened for CMV and randomized before conditioning for transplant and followed for CMV infection with weekly cultures of throat, urine, and blood and with weekly CMV serologies until day 100 after transplant. Leukocyte-depleted platelets were prepared by centrifugation, a procedure that removed greater than 99% of leukocytes. There were no CMV infections observed in 35 evaluable treatment patients compared with seven infections in 30 evaluable control patients (P = .0013). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of platelet concentrates in the treatment patients (164 concentrates) compared with the control patients (126 concentrates). Leukocyte-depleted platelets plus CMV-seronegative red blood cells are highly effective in preventing primary CMV infection after marrow transplant.\r"

The methods developed have had to contend with the high degree of homology of the alpha 2-globin gene (the site of the Hb Constant Spring mutation) and the alpha 1-globin gene. We have developed a single reaction polymerase chain reaction-based method that uses asymmetric priming and a temperature shift to accomplish dual ends, selective amplification of alpha 2 but not alpha 1 DNA and discrimination of normal and Hb Constant Spring alpha 2 genes by allele-specific fluorescence polymerase chain reaction. Advantages of this method over previous approaches include avoiding radioisotopes, precluding the need for electrophoresis, and serving as its own control for successful amplification. It is readily applicable to routine diagnosis, population screening, and prenatal diagnosis.\r"

In the mouse c-kit maps to the W locus, which is known to be of central importance in hematopoiesis. Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) YB5.B8, which was raised against peripheral blood blast cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), was recently shown to bind to the extracellular domain of the c-kit product. This antibody does not bind detectably to normal peripheral blood cells and identifies a sub-group of AML patients with poor prognosis. We have used MoAb YB5.B8 to study the expression of c-kit by normal human bone marrow cells by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, and to isolate multipotential and erythroid colony-forming cells. In a series of 11 normal adult bone marrow specimens, MoAb YB5.B8 bound to 4.0% +/- 1.8% of the cells in the low-density fraction. Dual-labeling experiments were performed with YB5.B8, and CD33, CD34, and CD10 MoAbs. Three populations of cells binding YB5.B8 could be identified based on their pattern of coexpression of the other markers; ie, YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33-, YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33+ and YB5.B8+/CD34+/CD33+. These populations had distinctive two-dimensional light scatter characteristics and are likely to correspond to precursor colony-forming cells, colony-forming cells, and maturing mast cells, respectively. No cells binding both YB5.B8 and an MoAb to the early lymphoid marker CD10 were found, implying that most early lymphoid cells do not express c-kit. MoAbs to the c-kit protein should prove valuable in multimarker studies of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Definition of a reference range of c-kit expression in normal human bone marrow will provide a sound basis for further studies of this marker in diagnosis and prognosis in AML.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the relationship between anti-interferon-alpha (anti-IFN-alpha) antibodies and loss of clinical responsiveness to IFN-alpha treatment, we examined sera from 59 patients with hairy cell leukemia who responded to therapy with recombinant IFN-alpha-2a (rIFN-alpha-2a). During the first 2 years of therapy, 10 patients developed rIFN-alpha-2a-neutralizing and 15 rIFN-alpha-2a-binding antibodies. Nine of the 59 initially responding patients became resistant to rIFN-alpha-2a and suffered a relapse of the disease at 7 to 24 months of treatment. All nine relapsing patients tested positive for both neutralizing and binding antibodies with titers above 400 INU/mL, while none of the antibody-negative patients relapsed. Six patients with detectable binding antibody titers below 400 INU/mL continued to respond to treatment. By measuring the IFN kinetics and the levels of the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein in mononuclear cells after a single injection each of rIFN-alpha-2a and nIFN-alpha the IFN antibodies of eight of the nine resistant rIFN-alpha patients were found to be highly specific for rIFN-alpha-2a. Therefore, these eight patients were switched to natural IFN-alpha (nIFN-alpha) therapy at doses of 3 million IU, three times a week. All eight patients responded to treatment with nIFN-alpha, achieving durable objective responses similar to those obtained previously with rIFN-alpha-2a. These data clearly demonstrate that rIFN-alpha antibody-positive patients can effectively be treated with nIFN-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Verapamil was evaluated as a chemosensitizer for reversing multidrug resistance in multiple myeloma both in vitro and in clinical trials. Bone marrows from 59 myeloma patients in relapse were evaluated for several resistance parameters: expression of p-glycoprotein (MDR1), doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine sensitivity, and the ability of added verapamil to reduce resistance to the cytotoxic agents. We found that verapamil was capable of sensitizing myeloma cells that exhibited resistance to doxorubicin and vincristine in vitro, but did not enhance sensitivity of cells that were drug sensitive (P less than .001). Myeloma cells expressing MDR1 immunohistochemically tended to be more doxorubicin resistant in vitro than MDR1-negative cells. In the clinical trials, 22 patients with myeloma refractory to vincristine-Adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) were treated with VAD plus high-dose intravenous verapamil (Ve). Among the 22 patients treated with VAD/Ve, five achieved a partial remission (23%). The median relapse-free survival for the VAD/Ve responders was 5.4 months and their overall survival from the start of VAD/Ve was better than that of the nonresponders. Among the subset of 10 patients whose myeloma cells were MDR1 positive, four responded clinically (40%), whereas none of five patients with MDR1-negative myeloma cells achieved remission with VAD/Ve. We also observed that myeloma cells from three of four VAD/Ve clinical responders exhibited in vitro chemosensitization with verapamil, whereas in vitro verapamil chemosensitization was seen in only one of six clinical nonresponders. Our observations demonstrate that clinical reversal of multidrug resistance can be achieved in some patients with VAD-refractory myeloma with the use of verapamil. In addition to their value in drug development, in vitro tests of MDR1 expression and of chemosensitizers plus cytotoxic drugs on the patients' bone marrow myeloma cells may identify patients who will respond clinically to chemosensitizer-containing regimens. We anticipate that chemosensitizer regimens capable of inhibiting multidrug resistance will play an increasing role in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including B-cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma and the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\r"

A sustained clinical and biologic complete remission was obtained in 15 children and a partial remission in one child; six children died early of opportunistic infection (n = 4) or of disease progression (n = 2). Of the 16 children who were placed in first remission, 10 received maintenance chemotherapy alone, while six underwent bone marrow transplantation (HLA matched in five, HLA mismatched in one). Of the children who received chemotherapy alone, only two are in long-term remission after cessation of treatment. The remaining eight patients relapsed after a mean period of 5.4 months (range 2 to 8 months). Further treatment using the same regimen induced second remissions of short duration; death occurred after a median period of 2.3 months (range 0.5 to 6 months). A total of nine patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Among the six children transplanted in remission, four are in long-term unmaintained remission, 1 to 6 years after HLA-matched BMT. However, the relapse that occurred in one patient 1 year post BMT is difficult to interpret because the donor, the patient's 5-year-old sister, also developed the disease 1 year later. An HLA-nonidentical BMT resulted in unmaintained remission for 1 year, with autologous hematologic reconstitution followed by disease relapse. HLA-nonidentical BMT failed in three other patients with active disease at time of transplant. The poor long-term results of chemotherapy alone justify the use of related HLA-matched BMT in complete remission.\r"

When plated under long-term BM culture (LTBMC) conditions, STRO-1+ cells generate adherent cell layers containing multiple stromal cell types, including adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblastic elements. STRO-1+ cells isolated from LTBMC at later times retain the capacity to generate adherent layers with a cellular composition identical to that of the parent cultures. The STRO-1-selected adherent layers are able to support the generation of clonogenic cells and mature hematopoietic cells from a population of CD34+ cells highly enriched in so-called long-term culture-initiating cells. We conclude that antibody STRO-1 binds to BM stromal elements with the capacity to transfer the hematopoietic microenvironment in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "91300071\r", 
  ".W": "Preliminary results from the IVth Leucocyte Culture Conference have classified the monoclonal antibody (MoAb), YTH 71.3.2, as CD66. Two other MoAbs, YPC 2/12.1 and CE6/2D3.1, share a common cellular specificity, reacting with cells of the neutrophil series and colonic epithelium. The YTH 71.3.2 and CE6/2D3.1 MoAbs both recognize a similar CD66 defined epitope that is distinct from that identified by YPC 2/12.1. By Western blotting, these antibodies react with different molecular species from cells of different lineages. The antibodies identify 50- to 55-Kd, 80- to 100-Kd, and 130- to 200-Kd components present in a semi-purified carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) preparation from colonic adenocarcinomas and a 90- to 130-Kd molecule from HL-60 cells. With the colonic cell line, LS174T, YPC2/12.1 stains diffuse bands of 160 to 200 Kd and 90 to 130 Kd with equal intensity, whereas the binding of CE6/2D3.1 and YTH 71.3.2 is biased toward the lower molecular weight set of molecules. Remarkably, all three antibodies recognize CEA-related molecules. Defined analyses using HeLa cells transfected with CEA, NCA(NCA-50/90), and CGM6(NCA-95) cDNAs show that the three MoAbs identify CEA to varying degrees. While YTH 71.3.2 and CE6/2D3.1 also bind to NCA-50/90, YPC 2/12.1 recognizes an epitope expressed by both the NCA-50/90 and NCA-95 molecular species.\r"

The 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-vitamin D3 is the most potent analog reported to date, having about 80-fold more activity than the reference 1,25(OH)2D3 for inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells. Also, this analog decreased RNA expression of MYC oncogene in HL-60 by 90% at 5 x 10(-10) mol/L. Intriguingly, intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization mediated in vivo by 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3 was found to be markedly (15-fold) less than that of 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, 1 alpha-25(OH)2D3 bound to 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors of both HL-60 and intestine more avidly than did 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3. This novel analog may open up new therapeutic strategies for several hematopoietic, skin, and bone abnormalities and may provide a new tool to understand how vitamin D3 seco-steroids induce cellular differentiation.\r"

We evaluated erythropoiesis by measuring serum transferrin receptor (TfR) levels in 406 women during normal pregnancy (N = 317), at delivery (N = 63), or in the early postpartum (N = 27). Despite the presence of the placenta and the frequent occurrence of iron deficiency, TfR levels remained low in the first two trimesters and increased in the third trimester and at delivery. To explain why erythropoiesic activity was relatively low in early pregnancy, we also measured serum immunoreactive erythropoietin (Epo) in relation to the degree of anemia. There was a very strong correlation between serum TfR and Epo levels in the entire group (r = .59, P less than .0001) as well as in each period of pregnancy. Epo levels remained low for the degree of anemia and did not correlate with hematocrit in the first two trimesters, but recovered afterwards. In the early postpartum, Epo production and erythropoiesis were normal. We conclude that: (1) erythropoiesis is decreased in the first part of pregnancy but increases afterwards; and (2) blunted Epo production in early pregnancy could be responsible for that observation.\r"

  ".W": "A cell line (B1) was established from the bone marrow of a patient with a relapse of acute leukemia characterized by a 4;11 chromosomal translocation and biphenotypic features of early B and myeloid lineages. Analysis of the growth requirements of this cell line showed density-dependent growth and secretion of an autostimulatory growth factor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism. Several lines of evidence implicate the participation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the autocrine growth regulation of B1 cells. These cells constitutively express the messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-1 and IL-1 receptor and secrete IL-1; recombinant IL-1 stimulated the growth of colonies when cells were seeded at low density, and anti-IL-1 antibodies inhibited the growth of colonies with cells seeded at higher density. B1 cells do not express detectable levels of mRNA for any of the other cytokines tested, and other cytokines failed to support the growth of B1 cells at low density. In addition, B1 cells express multiple cytokine receptor genes, including the receptors for IL-6, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor and gamma-interferon. Addition of the respective cytokines to the B1 cells resulted in inhibition of the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. The multiplicity of growth-inhibitory cytokine receptors on this leukemic cell line might be due to its biphenotypic lineage and may suggest new therapeutic possibilities in controlling leukemic cell proliferation.\r"

Proximal cell-cell interactions are involved, including physical contact via junctional complexes, exfoliation of surface membrane vesicles, proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound precursors, and exocytosis of soluble proteins (see Fig 5). At another level, the surface expresses receptors and other proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion, a multistep event that may be sufficient to activate some growth-associated genes and alter cell shape. The evidence indicates that together with secreted growth factors, surface membrane-associated molecules play a dynamic role in regulating multicellular assembly and cell differentiation and growth.\r"

The current study presents evidence that CD63 and Pltgp40, a platelet membrane glycoprotein identified in this laboratory, are the same molecule and that CD63/Pltgp40 is identical to the well-characterized, stage-specific melanoma-associated antigen ME491. Identity of CD63 and Pltgp40 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and sequential immunodepletion studies, which showed that the anti-Pltgp40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) H5C6 and an anti-CD63 MoAb CLB/Gran 12 recognized the same 40- to 55-Kd platelet glycoprotein. In addition, the anti-CD63 MoAb specifically recognized immunoaffinity-purified Pltgp40. Amino acid sequences obtained from NH2-terminal and tryptic fragment peptides of Pltgp40 were used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) probes using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. A 386-bp cDNA probe partially encoding CD63/Pltgp40 and a full length cDNA probe were 100% identical to the corresponding sequence of ME491. Antibodies H5C6 and CLB/Gran12 immunoprecipitated a 30- to 60-Kd heterodisperse glycoprotein from G361 melanoma cells, as had previously been reported for antibodies recognizing ME491. These data, taken together with the extensive homology recently reported between ME491, the Schistosoma mansoni membrane antigen SM23, CD37, the tumor-associated antigen CO-029, and the target of an antiproliferative antibody-1, suggest that CD63 is a member of a new family of related molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow was isolated from a child with congenital mastocytosis. Upon prolonged in vitro culture, initially in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3), a population of relatively large fusiform, strongly adherent cells grew out plus a subpopulation of smaller nonadherent cells. The morphology of the adherent cells was not typical of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, nor of standard hematopoietic cell types, whereas the morphology of the nonadherent cells resembled mast cells. Neither cell type required the presence of IL-3 nor a feeder layer of fibroblasts for continued growth. Attempts to isolate the two populations were unsuccessful. This cell strain comprised of both cell populations has been termed human bone marrow-derived mastocytosis cells (HBM-M). These cells were found to possess some of the cytochemical, ultrastructural, and surface phenotypic features of degranulated mast cells. They reacted with the mast cell marker, monoclonal antibody YB5.B8, but not with the basophil specific monoclonal antibody Bsp-1 and released the inflammatory mediators histamine, leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2, and platelet-activating factor constitutively. This release was not potentiated by immunologic- or nonimmunologic-activating stimuli. In addition, they exhibited cytochemical and surface phenotypic features of monocytes. Our results indicate that a population of abnormal proliferative cells exist in the marrow of this patient; that these cells may be responsible for the patient's pronounced systemic proliferation of mast cells and the associated symptoms; and that the cell's mast cell, monocyte properties may be indicative of a common bone marrow-derived mast cell/monocyte precursor.\r"

These closely resemble myofibroblasts that were described in other fibrotic tissues. We studied the expression of alpha-SMA in a series of murine BM-derived stromal cell lines to investigate the cellular origin and functional significance of myofibroblast-like cells in hematopoietic tissues. Although these cell lines differed in their biologic properties, most of them expressed alpha-SMA under certain conditions. Cells expressing alpha-SMA constituted a minor population in post-confluent, growth-arrested cultures. However, the incidence of cells expressing alpha-SMA increased significantly when cultures were transferred to nonconfluent conditions. A similar increase in alpha-SMA-positive cells occurred after a strip of cells was scraped away from the confluent cell layer; the cells of the affected area acquired alpha-SMA-positive contractile phenotype. The relationship between alpha-SMA expression and hematopoietic activity was studied using a cloned cell line of BM origin (14F1.1). The ability of these endothelial-adipocyte cells to support hematopoiesis in vitro was maximal under confluent conditions, whereas their expression of alpha-SMA under such conditions was residual. Moreover, in long-term BM cultures supported by confluent 14F1.1 cells, stromal areas associated with proliferating hematopoietic precursors, known as \"cobblestone areas,\" were devoid of alpha-SMA-positive cells. These observations suggest that the expression of alpha-SMA is reversible and inversely related to hematopoietic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Retroviral-mediated gene transfer of human adenosine deaminase (hADA) provides a model system for the development of somatic gene therapy as a therapy for diseases of bone marrow-derived cells. We have previously demonstrated that hADA can be observed in all hematopoietic lineages in a minority of mice transplanted with bone marrow cells infected with a simplified retroviral vector, ZipPGK-ADA. Here we report a majority of mice (six of eight) demonstrate expression of hADA in the peripheral blood at least 6 months after transplantation with bone marrow infected with this simplified retroviral vector, which contains no selectable marker. The failure to express hADA in two of eight mice was associated with the absence of the recombinant retroviral provirus in DNA prepared from bone marrow cells of these mice apparently due to failure to efficiently infect the reconstituting hematopoietic stem cell. In an effort to preselect bone marrow stem cells containing proviral integrations, we incorporated the selectable marker neo phosphotransferase (NEO) into a retroviral vector encoding hADA, N2/ZipPGK-ADATKNEO, and used G418 selection of infected bone marrow cells before transplantation. In contrast to the simplified retroviral vector, hADA expression in these recipients was short lived (less than 8 weeks), despite the continued presence of intact provirus in DNA prepared from bone marrow of these mice. To determine whether the preselection of bone marrow using G418 was responsible for the lack of sustained hADA expression, we repeated the infection with the N2/ZipPGK-ADATKNEO vector but omitted the G418 selection step. Again, the majority of recipient mice failed to express hADA long term, although the continued presence of provirus in DNA prepared from peripheral blood cell mononuclear cells was clearly demonstrated. Finally, we demonstrate clonal fluctuation of infected stem cells, and observe a temporal correlation between cessation of expression of hADA and the emergence of a dominant stem cell clone between 14 and 20 weeks posttransplantation in one recipient. These data suggest that inclusion of a second transcriptional unit that includes neo phosphotransferase sequences in this simplified vector is associated with decreased expression of the nonselectable ADA sequences.\r"

Using this procedure, we obtained a new class of murine hematopoietic colonies that had very high secondary plating efficiencies in vitro and could differentiate into not only myeloid cells but also into lymphoid lineage cells. The phenotypes of interleukin-3 (IL-3) induced blast colony cells were Thy-1-positive and lineage-marker-negative. We examined whether these blast colony cells contained primitive hematopoietic stem cells in vivo and could reconstitute hematopoietic tissues in lethally irradiated mice. Blast colony cells could generate macroscopic visible spleen colonies on days 8 and 12, and 5 x 10(3) blast cells were sufficient to protect them from lethally irradiation. It was shown that 6 or 8 weeks after transplantation of 5 x 10(3) blast cells, donor male cells were detected in the spleen and thymus of the female recipients but not in the bone marrow by Southern blot analysis using Y-encoded DNA probe. After 10 weeks, bone marrow cells were partially repopulated from donor cells. In a congenic mouse system, donor-derived cells (Ly5.2) were detected in the thymus and spleen 6 weeks after transplantation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses showed that B cells and macrophages developed from donor cells in the spleen. In the thymus, donor-derived cells were found in CD4, CD8 double-positive, single-positive, and double-negative populations. Reconstitution of bone marrow was delayed and myeloid and lymphoid cells were detected 10 weeks after transplantation. These results indicate that IL-3-induced blast cells contain the primitive hematopoietic stem cells capable of reconstituting hematopoietic organs in lethally irradiated mice.\r"

Treatment of CD34-enriched cells with recombinant interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor for 24 hours increased expression of HB24 threefold and HB9 fourfold. Based on studies with actinomycin D, the HB24 and HB9 transcripts in human CD34-positive cells have short half-lives, estimated to be 30 to 45 minutes. Downregulation of HB24 and HB9 expression was found following the treatment of in vitro cultures of CD34-positive cells with IL-3.

  ".W": "Various murine cell populations were tested for their ability to generate interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to IL-3. Among these, bone marrow cells exhibit the most prominent IL-6 production. The responder cells in this organ have been further characterized by cell fractionation on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and in situ hybridization. These procedures have allowed us to ascribe the following features to the cells mainly responsible for IL-3-induced IL-6 production: (1) they possess a low density and a relatively high forward and perpendicular light scatter (FLS/PLS); (2) they are characterized by a high rhodamine (Rh) retention; and (3) their enrichment in various subpopulations is similar to that obtained for progenitors forming colonies in the methylcellulose assay colony-forming units (CFU-C). In contrast, IL-3 target cells in terms of IL-6 production are absent both in the mature and in the most immature bone marrow compartment. Indeed, the Rh-dull population that is enriched for cells with marrow repopulating activity does not respond to the growth factor and mature cells cannot be induced to express IL-6 as assessed by (1) FLS/PLS characteristics, (2) the monoclonal antibody ER-MP 20 recognizing monocytes and granulocytic cells, and (3) in situ hybridization. Taken together, our data support the conclusion that the bone marrow cells generating IL-6 in response to IL-3 belong to a progenitor population with enhanced mitochondrial activity, comprising probably several types of immature cells of the myeloid lineage including macrophage/granulocyte precursors.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-5 (IL-5) promotes the growth and differentiation of human eosinophils and may regulate the selective eosinophilia and eosinophil activation seen in certain diseases. Radiolabeled recombinant human IL-5 (hIL-5) was used to characterize the IL-5 receptor present on normal human eosinophils and on the myeloid leukemia line HL-60, which can be induced to differentiate into eosinophilic cells. Binding studies with eosinophils and HL-60 cells grown under alkaline conditions demonstrated similar high-affinity binding sites for hIL-5 on both cell types with kd values of approximately 400 pmol/L. The binding observed was specific in that it was not inhibited by hIL-3, human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or hIL-2. Binding studies with a number of other human cell lines, including a B-lymphoma line, and with lymphocyte and neutrophil preparations were also performed, but IL-5 receptors were not detectable on these cells. The number of hIL-5 receptors on HL-60 cells could be correlated with its propensity to differentiate towards an eosinophilic cell type. Expression of hIL-5 receptors on HL-60 cells was upregulated by butyric acid under alkaline conditions, downregulated by hIL-3, virtually eliminated by dimethyl sulfoxide and hIL-5, while hIL-2 had no detectable effect. One major 125I-hIL-5-crosslinked complex of 75 to 85 Kd in Mr was detected on HL-60 cells using crosslinking agents giving a molecular mass of 55 to 60 Kd for the hIL-5 receptor itself. Studies using cellular autoradiography showed that IL-5 receptors were evenly distributed on eosinophils but that receptor distribution on HL-60 cells was noticeably heterogeneous. Eosinophils were the only cells in slides prepared from peripheral blood that had detectable levels of IL-5 receptors in agreement with the specific action of IL-5 on the human eosinophil lineage.\r"

  ".U": "91300089\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is tightly regulated in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Accumulation of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs only at the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages of myeloid differentiation and is negligible at other stages of myeloid development and in other tissues. The goal of our studies was to begin to understand the events that occur to control MPO gene expression during normal granulocytopoiesis. Chromatin structure of the MPO gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei and Southern blot analysis. No detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites were found in the region of the MPO gene in non-myeloid cells. One site was present in the 5' upstream region in myeloid cells that are developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Three sites of hypersensitivity in the regions of the putative MPO promoter and upstream region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. These sites were markedly reduced in terminally differentiated, non-expressing myeloid cells. Analysis of DNA methylation of the MPO gene using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes showed that the gene was highly methylated in non-myeloid cells. Stepwise demethylation occurred in myeloid cells developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Maximal demethylation in the 5' gene region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. This methylation pattern did not change in terminally differentiated, MPO non-expressing myeloid cells. A somatic hybrid cell formed by fusion of HL-60 (MPO-expressing cells) and PUT (MPO non-expressing lymphoid cells) extinguished expression of MPO and showed a chimeric pattern of MPO gene methylation, suggesting that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for expression of the MPO gene. Our studies show that demethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity of the MPO gene were associated with a tissue-dependent potential for MPO gene expression that preceded the developmental ability to express MPO mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "91300090\r", 
  ".W": "Activated protein C is a plasma anticoagulant. For activated protein C to function as an anticoagulant, it must form a complex with protein S. Protein S anticoagulant activity is neutralized by formation of a reversible complex with C4b binding protein (C4bBP). C4bBP is an acute-phase plasma protein. When C4bBP levels increase, mass action forces the level of free protein S to decrease, giving rise to an acquired functional protein S deficiency. It has been proposed that these elevated C4bBP levels and the resultant acquired deficiency of protein S that occurs in inflammation could contribute to a hypercoagulable state. An experimental model to test this hypothesis was suggested by our previous studies that demonstrated that inhibition of protein C activation rendered baboons hypercoagulable in response to sublethal Escherichia coli infusion (J Clin Invest 79:918, 1987). We have extended these studies to examine the effect of inhibition of protein S activity with C4bBP in the host (baboon) response to infusion of sublethal concentrations of E coli organisms. Five sets of animals were studied: (1) those challenged with sublethal concentrations of E coli alone (0.4 x 10(10)/kg); (2) those supplemented only with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (3) those challenged with the same level of E coli but supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (4) those challenged with sublethal E coli and supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg) and sufficient protein S (2.3 mg/kg) to fill the protein S binding sites on C4bBP; and (5) those challenged with lethal concentrations of E coli. Sublethal E coli infusion (group 1 animals) caused only an acute-phase response with no consumption of fibrinogen, detectable organ damage, or detectable tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the plasma. C4bBP infusion (group 2 animals) resulted in no significant physiologic changes, no detectable plasma TNF, and little change in fibrinogen level. The group 3 animals, receiving both sublethal E coli and C4bBP, exhibited rapid consumption of fibrinogen, systemic organ damage, and detectable circulating TNF ultimately leading to death. The overall response of this group was very similar to the response of the group 5 animals receiving an LD100 dose of E coli. The group 4 animals, which were treated exactly as above except that C4bBP was supplemented with a slight excess of protein S, responded essentially like those that received sublethal E coli alone. These studies suggest that the elevation of C4bBP during an inflammatory response can contribute to fibrinogen consumption and vascular damage. This vascular damage may be associated with enhanced elaboration of cytokines like TNF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In evaluating the role of coagulation in sepsis we used factor Xa blocked in the active center with [5-(dimethylamino)1-naphthalenesulfonyl]-glutamylglycylarginyl+ ++ chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-Xa). We infused 1 mg/kg of DEGR-Xa together with LD100 concentrations of Escherichia coli (4 x 10(10) organisms/kg) into five baboons. As controls, we infused E coli alone into five baboons. The inflammatory, coagulant, and cell injury responses to E coli of both the treated and control groups were lethal and were similar in every respect except for the complete inhibition of the consumption of fibrinogen in the DEGR-Xa group. The half life of DEGR-Xa was approximately 10 hours and 2 hours, as determined by isotopic and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. These results for the first time demonstrate that, although coagulation occurs in E coli sepsis, fibrin formation per se did not influence the lethal outcome in this model. These results also show the effectiveness of DEGR-Xa as an anticoagulant and raise the possibility that it could serve as an alternative to anticoagulants currently in use.\r"

These cells aggregated as measured by the disappearance of single cells during rotary agitation. Aggregation was dependent on the presence of extracellular fibrinogen (approximately 500 nmol/L) and divalent cations, and required prior activation of the GPIIb-IIIa. A synthetic peptide (GRGDSP) and monoclonal anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody (2G12) that block platelet aggregation also blocked aggregation of these cells. Parent CHO cells or those expressing recombinant GPIIb-IIIa containing a point mutation that causes variant thrombasthenia both failed to aggregate when stimulated in the presence of fibrinogen. These data show that GPIIb-IIIa is the only unique platelet surface component required for aggregation.\r"

Aggregometric responses at various fibrinogen concentrations are found to be bell-shaped and show a maximum at fibrinogen concentrations (Fmax) similar to the 125I-fibrinogen hemisaturating doses. At higher and lower fibrinogen concentrations, platelet aggregation velocities decrease in a parallel manner. Lowering ADP concentration increases Fmax, in agreement with the modulatory effect of ADP on fibrinogen binding to platelets. Variations of fibrinogen in the range of physiopathologic plasma concentrations affect platelet aggregation induced by any ADP dose. These results clarify the relationship between the fibrinogen binding process and aggregation and demonstrate that plasma fibrinogen concentration has a major influence on the velocity of platelet aggregation.\r"

A competitive fluorescent immunoassay was developed to measure the plasma concentration of LACI in samples from normal individuals and patients with a variety of diseases. The LACI concentration in an adult control population varied from 60% to 160% of the mean with a mean value corresponding to 89 ng/mL or 2.25 nmol/L. Plasma LACI levels were not decreased in patients with severe chronic hepatic failure, warfarin therapy, primary pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, or the lupus anticoagulant. Plasma LACI antigen was decreased in some, but not all patients with gram-negative bacteremia and evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Plasma LACI levels were elevated in women undergoing the early stages of labor (29%), in patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (45%), and in patients receiving intravenous heparin (375%). A radioligand blot of the pre- and post-heparin plasma samples shows the increase to be in a 40-Kd form of LACI. Very low levels of plasma LACI antigen were found in patients with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia and hypobetalipoproteinemia, diseases associated with low plasma levels of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins. Following the injection of heparin into one patient with homozygous abetalipoproteinemia, the plasma LACI antigen level increased to a level comparable with that in normal individuals after heparin treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) is present in vivo in at least three different pools: sequestered in platelets, associated with plasma lipoproteins, and released into plasma by intravenous heparin, possibly from vascular endothelium. In this study we have purified the heparin-relesable form of LACI from post-heparin plasma and show that it is structurally different from lipoprotein LACI. The purification scheme uses heparin-agarose chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography and results in a 185,000-fold purification with a 33% yield. Heparin-releasable LACI (HRL), as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under reducing conditions, appears as a major band at 40 Kd and a minor band at 36 Kd. Immunoblot analysis suggests that the 36-Kd band arises from carboxyl-terminus proteolysis that occurs during the purification. HRL has a specific activity similar to that of HepG2 or lipoprotein LACI. HRL and lipoprotein LACI combine with lipoproteins in vitro while purified HepG2 LACI does not. I125-labeled HRL, injected into a rabbit, is cleared more slowly than I125-labeled HepG2 LACI, which may be due to attachment to lipoproteins in vivo. Preliminary evidence suggests that HRL is associated with vascular endothelium, possibly by attachment to glycosaminoglycans.\r"

In the present study, the effects of IL-4 on these regulatory mechanisms were investigated using cultured human umbilical vein EC. TM downregulation induced by the pyrogens IL-1 (100 U/mL), TNF (500 U/mL), and LPS (20 micrograms/mL) to less than 50% of TM activity of untreated cells during a 12-hour incubation period was completely neutralized when these mediators were coincubated with IL-4 (100 U/mL). In accordance with TM surface activity, TM messenger RNA was decreased by IL-1, TNF, and LPS to less than 40% of untreated cells; this effect was in part antagonized by IL-4. No influence of IL-4 on EC tissue factor induction by IL-1, TNF, and LPS was found. Binding studies using 125I-radiolabeled IL-4 suggest that EC express a single class of high-affinity binding sites (kd = 3.2 pmol/L; 2,000 to 2,500 receptors per cell). These results show that IL-4, in part, protects the EC surface against pyrogen-induced procoagulant changes. Transcriptional regulatory mechanisms seem to be involved in EC surface TM regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The role of thrombin inhibition in platelet vessel wall interaction and thrombus growth was studied under controlled flow conditions. Natural hirudin and recombinant hirudin (r-hirudin), which are specific thrombin inhibitors, were compared with heparinized blood (1.8 +/- 0.2 U/mL) and Ca(2+)-chelated blood in their potential to inhibit platelet interaction and thrombus growth on two biologic vascular surfaces and one immobilized vessel wall component. The substrates were perfused by flowing blood at shear rates typical of patent and stenosed arteries (212 to 1,690/s) for 5 minutes. Platelet deposition was measured by In-111-labeled platelets. We found that both natural and r-hirudin have similar effects on platelet-substrate interaction. As compared with heparin, platelet deposition to mildly damaged vessel wall and digested collagen type I was not reduced by hirudin or citrate. However, hirudin and citrate significantly reduced platelet deposition to severely damaged vessel wall (platelets x 10(6)/cm2: 93 +/- 10 in heparinized blood v 50 +/- 7 in blood treated with 100 U/mL r-hirudin). Therefore, thrombus growth on areas of severe wall damage is in part dependent on local thrombin production at the site of vascular damage. We also found that hirudin added to heparinized blood reduced platelet deposition to severely injured wall but not to subendothelium or collagen-coated slides. Hirudin added to citrated blood did not affect platelet deposition. Our study indicates that local thrombin generation at the site of severe injury will induce platelet activation and deposition even in the presence of average therapeutic heparin levels that inhibit blood coagulation.\r"

  ".U": "91300101\r", 
  ".W": "An important mechanism of platelet regulation is the formation of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Our previous studies suggested that the DAG/PKC pathway plays an important role in the induction of secretion and secondary aggregation rather than the earlier events of shape change and primary aggregation. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the delayed effects of PKC on platelets may result from delayed accumulation of DAG. The kinetics of DAG formation in human platelets were determined. When platelets were stimulated with gamma-thrombin, the largest phase of DAG accumulation was delayed for 0.6 to 0.8 minutes and DAG mass levels remained elevated for at least 2 minutes. In platelets stimulated with collagen, DAG accumulation was delayed for 1.0 to 1.2 minutes and DAG mass levels remained elevated for at least 3 minutes after stimulation. Sustained DAG production was also associated with sustained activation of PKC as monitored by phosphorylation of the 40-Kd substrate of PKC. The physiologic significance of delayed DAG accumulation was investigated using the cell-permeable DAG analog, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8). In synergy with subthreshold gamma-thrombin or collagen, exogenous diC8 reconstituted platelet activation. The optimal timing of addition of diC8 was 0.5 minutes after stimulation with gamma-thrombin or collagen. These kinetics were similar to those of endogenous DAG accumulation. These studies underscore the importance of a delayed accumulative phase of DAG generation as a mechanism controlling the onset of platelet secretion and irreversible aggregation.\r"
