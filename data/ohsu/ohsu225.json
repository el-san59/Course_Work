  ".W": "We have determined the three-dimensional structure of two crystal forms of an antilysozyme Fab-lysozyme complex by x-ray crystallography. The epitope on lysozyme consists of three sequentially separated subsites, including one long, nearly continuous, site from Gln-41 through Tyr-53 and one from Gly-67 through Pro-70. Antibody residues interacting with lysozyme occur in each of the six complementarity-determining regions and also include one framework residue. Arg-45 and Arg-68 form a ridge on the surface of lysozyme, which binds in a groove on the antibody surface. Otherwise the surface of interaction between the two proteins is relatively flat, although it curls at the edges. The surface of interaction is approximately 26 X 19 A. No water molecules are found in the interface. The positive charge on the two arginines is complemented by the negative charge of Glu-35 and Glu-50 from the heavy chain of the antibody. The backbone structure of the antigen, lysozyme, is mostly unperturbed, although there are some changes in the epitope region, most notably Pro-70. One side chain not in the epitope, Trp-63, undergoes a rotation of approximately 180 degrees about the C beta--C gamma bond. The Fab elbow bends in the two crystal forms differ by 7 degrees.\r"

To obtain information on the chromosomal assignment of the elements that control gamma-to-beta switching, we analyzed the chromosomal composition of hybrids producing exclusively or predominantly human fetal globin and hybrids producing only adult human globin. No human chromosome was consistently present in hybrids expressing fetal globin and consistently absent in hybrids expressing adult globin. Subcloning experiments demonstrated identical chromosomal compositions in subclones displaying the fetal globin program and those that had switched to expression of the adult globin program. These data indicate that retention of only one human chromosome-i.e., chromosome 11--sufficient for expression of human fetal globin and the subsequent gamma-to-beta switch. The results suggest that the gamma-to-beta switch is controlled either cis to the beta-globin locus or by a trans-acting mechanism, the genes of which reside on human chromosome 11.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the human pituitary contains a previously unidentified, nonprolactin (non-hPRL), non-growth-hormone (non-hGH) factor capable of stimulating mammary development, we tested the effects of whole human pituitary extract (hPE) and pituitary extracts depleted of hPRL and hGH (\"stripped hPE\") in hypophysectomized, castrated estradiol (E2)-treated male rats and rhesus monkeys. Both whole and stripped hPE significantly stimulated rat mammary development (mean scores = 3.3 and 2.0, respectively, on a scale ranging from 0 to 4) in comparison with controls (mean score = 1.0). Mammary development was not due to minute concentrations of hGH or hPRL remaining in stripped hPE because 30- to 100-fold higher concentrations of hGH (Genentech) and 1000-fold higher concentrations of hPRL were required to stimulate significant mammary development. Non-pituitary extracts of human ovary, muscle, and serum, and bovine serum albumin did not stimulate rat mammary gland growth. Trypsin destroyed the mammary mitogenic activity of whole hPE, indicating that the unidentified factor is likely a protein. Mammary growth and development were also stimulated in hypophysectomized, E2-treated monkeys by stripped hPE (mean histological score = 3.25 vs. 1.35 in control animals). Monkeys receiving stripped hPE had undetectable levels of hGH and hPRL in serum sampled over a 24-hr period. These findings suggest that the human pituitary contains a non-hPRL, non-hGH factor that stimulates mammary growth and may be important in normal mammary growth and development and perhaps in breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Conjugated bilirubin and copper ions at their physiological concentrations in bile may play an important role in hydroperoxide and other detoxification. Conjugated bilirubin may also be an important chain-breaking antioxidant preventing lipid peroxidation. Bilirubin ditaurine (BR-DT), a water-soluble model compound of conjugated bilirubin, completely prevents the peroxyl radical-induced oxidation of phosphatidylcholine in either multilamellar liposomes or micelles. This antioxidant activity is associated with the bilirubin moiety of BR-DT, since taurine alone is inefficient in scavenging peroxyl radicals. The number of peroxyl radicals trapped per molecule of BR-DT is 1.9, compared to 4.7 trapped per molecule of biliverdin, the water-soluble physiological precursor of bilirubin. Peroxyl radical-induced oxidation of BR-DT results in a spectral shift in maximal absorbance toward shorter wavelengths; biliverdin is not formed as a major oxidation product. BR-DT, but neither taurine nor biliverdin, greatly accelerates the cupric ion-catalyzed decomposition of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. In the presence of ferric ion, BR-DT shows no lipid hydroperoxide-degrading activity. Addition of cupric ion to BR-DT results in formation of a complex with spectral features similar to that of a biliverdin-cupric ion complex, indicating that BR-DT and cupric ion undergo redox reactions.\r"

Electron microscopy of purified RNA following treatment of virus with the psoralen reagent 4'-aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT) revealed circles with lengths corresponding to the individual segments. RNA blot analysis using polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that RNA from AMT-treated virus had a slowed migration, consistent with it being a single-stranded circle. Furthermore, nuclease S1 protection assays indicated that the termini of the RNA segments form an approximately 15-base-pair-long panhandle. This structure is consistent with the partial sequence complementarity that has been observed for the termini of all influenza virus RNAs. By RNA blot analysis, circular structures of viral sense RNA were also found in influenza virus-infected cells at early and late time points. The circular RNA was the predominant species at the time when the major transcription product is message RNA. This finding and the observation that the termination signal for mRNA synthesis directly abuts the panhandle suggest that a panhandle in the template viral RNA is a cis regulatory signal promoting the synthesis of mRNA instead of plus-sense template. Also, since the panhandle is present in high concentration in virions, we suggest that it is required for packaging and that the input RNA after infection is in the proper conformation for synthesis of primary transcripts.\r"

We have applied this system to the colorimetric determination of brain acetylcholinesterase activity in rats. The reproducibility of the assay was demonstrated by repetitive assays over 24 hr, its specificity was established through the use of a highly specific organophosphorus inhibitor, and the activities measured in different brain areas agreed with the known distribution of acetylcholinesterase. No electroencephalographic abnormalities and no change in vigilance level were observed in the experimental animals. This methodology should prove to be useful for the colorimetric measurement of different enzymes or metabolites in various organs.\r"

  ".W": "Here we describe a nonsynaptic mechanism for filtering out potentially perturbing sensory feedback during locomotion. During flight, the cockroach moves its cerci, two abdominal sensory appendages, about their joint with the body and holds them in place. The cerci bear highly sensitive wind-receptive hairs, which would be strongly stimulated by flight wind. Such wind could cause habituation of the synaptic connections from these cercal receptors onto interneurons responsible for the running escape response to an approaching predator. We have found that the cercal displacement blocks one-third to one-half of the action potentials along the sensory nerve, possibly aiding in protection against such habituation. This block occurs if one experimentally displaces a cercus, and the block persists in the complete absence of any connections with the central nervous system. The block appears to be nonsynaptic and to result instead from mechanical pressure on the nerve near the joint. The results suggest that activity in peripheral nerves in other animals may also be affected by the position or movement of joints through which the nerves pass.\r"

Here we use patch-clamp recording to show that a cAMP-dependent process enhances the AcCho response of the neurons by a mechanism likely to involve an increase in the number of functional AcChoRs. The increase occurs without requiring protein synthesis and without involving a detectable increase in the total number of AcChoRs on the cell surface measured with a labeled receptor probe. The results imply that the neurons have functional and nonfunctional pools of AcChoRs and that functional receptors can be recruited from intracellular receptors or from nonfunctional receptors on the cell surface by a cAMP-dependent process. A cAMP-dependent regulation of the number of functional neurotransmitter receptors would provide a reversible mechanism by which cell-cell interactions could modulate synaptic transmission in the nervous system.\r"

At all ages, the labeled neurons are most numerous in the topographically appropriate part of the ION, but in younger embryos up to 49% of them are found outside this region. The distribution of these \"aberrantly\" projecting neurons is variable, but they generally occur throughout the entire ION. They all die during the ION's period of neuronal death, accounting for most of the 60% cell loss that then occurs. We therefore suggest that a major role of neuronal death during brain development is to reduce the imprecision of neuronal connections.\r"

Recognition of the binding site is not determined by the nucleotide sequence at the site of binding per se but through the specific local variation in the DNA helix geometry. Both dynamic curved structures, which are generated by supercoiling, and static ones, which are sequenced-directed, could support and efficient enzyme-DNA complex formation. Binding interactions are dependent upon the degree of the helix curvature and decrease with the straightening of the binding site. DNase I protection experiments identify distinct domains of enzyme binding within the bent structure and suggest the induction of structural changes within these regions as a result of protein-DNA interactions.\r"

The binding of two monoclonal antibodies to cis-DDP-modified DNA was competitively inhibited (50% control) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by 4-6 nM concentrations (600-900 fmol) of cis-DDP bound to DNA, (D/N)b = 0.031. Similar concentrations (4-6 nM) of cis-DDP-modified poly(dG).poly(dC) also inhibited antibody binding, whereas higher concentrations (17-36 nM) of cis-DDP-modified poly[d(AG)].poly[d(TC)] were required for inhibition. Adducts formed by cis-DDP on other synthetic DNA polymers did not inhibit antibody binding to cis-DDP-DNA.

The monoclonal antibodies therefore recognize a bifunctional Pt-DNA adduct with cis stereochemistry in which platinum is coordinated by two adjacent guanines or, to a lesser degree, by adjacent adenine and guanine. A monoclonal antibody raised against trans-DDP-DNA was competitively inhibited in an ELISA by 40 nM trans-DDP bound to DNA, (D/N)b = 0.022. This antibody crossreacted with unmodified, denatured DNA. Its binding to trans-DDP-DNA was selectively inhibited by trans-DDP-modified poly[d(GT)].poly[d(CA)] (50% inhibition at 1 nM bound trans-DDP).

We now report that the activity of ACP in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides is not altered by treatment with the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide nor by complete removal of the phosphopantetheine residue by treatment with a specific phosphodiesterase. The function of ACP in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides is thus clearly different from that involved in lipid biosynthesis. We have nevertheless found that the same molecular species of ACP that undergo enzymic acylation with long-chain fatty acid residues also function in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides.\r"

The nit-3 gene was isolated from a cosmid-based genomic library by dual selection for benomyl resistance and for the ability to complement a nit-3 mutant strain using the sibling-selection procedure. The nit-3 gene was subcloned as a 3.8-kilobase DNA fragment from a cosmid that carried an approximately 40-kilobase N. crassa DNA insert. A restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the cloned segment displayed tight linkage to two linkage-group-4 markers that flank the genomic location of nit-3. RNA gel blot analyses of RNA from wild-type and various mutant strains were carried out to examine the molecular mechanism for regulation of nit-3 gene expression. The nit-3 gene was transcribed to give a large mRNA of approximately 3.4 kilobases, the expected size to encode nitrate reductase. The nit-3 gene was only expressed in wild-type cells subject to simultaneous nitrogen derepression and nitrate induction. A mutant of nit-2, the major nitrogen regulatory gene of Neurospora, did not have detectable levels of nit-3 gene transcripts under the exact conditions in which these transcripts were highly expressed in wild type. Similarly, a mutant of nit-4, which defines a minor positive-acting nitrogen control gene, failed to express detectable levels of the nit-3 transcript. Nitrate reductase gene expression was partially resistant to nitrogen repression in a mutant of the nmr gene, which appears to be a regulatory gene with a direct role in nitrogen catabolite repression. Results are presented that suggest that the enzyme glutamine synthetase does not serve any regulatory role in controlling nitrate reductase gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "A model is proposed to account for selective chemical evolution, progressing from a relatively simple initial set of abiotic synthetic phenomena up to the elaborately sophisticated processes that are almost certainly required to produce the complex molecules, such as replicatable RNA-like oligonucleotides, needed for a Darwinian form of selection to start operating. The model makes the following assumptions: (i) that a small number of micromolecular substances were present at high concentration; (ii) that a random assembly mechanism combined these molecules into a variety of multimeric compounds comprising a wide repertoire of rudimentary catalytic activities; and (iii) that a lytic system capable of breaking down the assembled products existed. The model assumes further that catalysts supplied with substrates were significantly protected against breakdown. It is shown that, by granting these assumptions, an increasingly complex network of metabolic pathways would progressively be established. At the same time, the catalysts concerned would accumulate selectively to become choice substrates for elongation and other modifications that could enhance their efficiency, as well as their survival. Chemical evolution would thus proceed by a dual process of metabolic extension and catalytic innovation. Such a process should be largely deterministic and predictable from initial conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Complementary oligonucleotides with 5' overhanging deoxyguanosine or deoxycytidine stretches, respectively, of the general form 5'-d(GGGCAARAAC).5'-d(CCCGTTYTTG), where R represents the bases adenine (A), hypoxanthine (base of inosine nucleoside, I), purine (R), 2-aminopurine (n2R), or 2,6-diaminopurine (n2,6(2)R) and where Y represents the pyrimidine bases thymine (T) or cytosine (C), have been chemically synthesized. After hybridization of complementary fragments, they were ligated to form multimers and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anomalous gel migration was observed for the sequences 5'-d(AARAA) when the R.Y base pair was dA.dT, dI.dC, or dR.dT. All of these base pairs lack at least the amino group at position 2 of the purine base. The degree of anomalous gel migration was also related to the substituent at position 6 of the purine base. An amino group at position 6 was more effective than a carbonyl or a hydrogen in inducing anomalous gel migration. Additionally, the fragments 5'-d(GGGCAIAIAC).5'-d(CCCGTCTCTG), 5'-d(GGGCAIIIAC).5'-d(CCCGTCCCTG), and 5'-d(GGGCIIAIIC).5'-d(CCCGCCTCCG) were prepared in which increasing numbers of dA.dT base pairs are replaced by dI.dC base pairs. The degree of gel-migration anomaly of these sequences correlates with the number of dA.dT base pairs left in the five-base purine block. The data support the hypothesis that within the deoxyadenosine tracts, the base pairs fold into the minor groove at position 2 of the base to balance for the NH2 groups at position 6. This hypothesis explains the formation of a B'-form DNA structure for the deoxyadenosine tracts as well as DNA curvature.\r"

Like other dehydrogenases, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is a double-domain structure, but the bilobal nature of this enzyme is more pronounced than has been previously observed. The amino-terminal domain, which comprises approximately the first 200 residues, is responsible for binding the NAD cofactor and displays considerable structural homology with the dinucleotide binding domains observed in other NAD-, NADP-, and FAD-dependent enzymes. The carboxyl-terminal domain, comprising the remaining 107 residues, appears to be all alpha-helical and bears little homology to other known dehydrogenases. The subunit-subunit interface in the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase dimer is formed almost exclusively by residues in the smaller helical domain. A difference map between the apo and holo forms of the crystalline enzyme has been interpreted in terms of the NAD molecule being bound in a typically extended conformation. The location of the coenzyme binding site, along with the structural homology to other dehydrogenases, makes it possible to speculate about the location of the binding site for the fatty acyl-CoA substrate.\r"

The origin requirement for unwinding can be satisfied by the 64-base-pair SV40 core origin that supports T-antigen-dependent DNA replication both in vivo and in vitro. The core origin contains three domains with specific DNA sequence features. These include an inverted repeat, a central T-antigen binding domain, and an adenine- and thymine-rich domain containing a DNA bending focus. The domain and spacer requirements of the core origin for DNA unwinding and replication in vitro are strikingly similar to the origin requirements for DNA replication in vivo. Thus, each of the three functional domains of the core origin contributes directly to the initiation of duplex DNA unwinding by T antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Human inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (I alpha TI) is a plasma glycoprotein of Mr 180,000, which has been described as a single polypeptide chain. Recently, however, we proposed that I alpha TI might be composed of a heavy (H) chain (Mr = 95,000) and a light (L) chain (Mr = 40,000) synthesized by two separate mRNAs. In the present study we have characterized cDNAs for the H chain of I alpha TI. These cDNAs collectively covered two sequences (977 and 1450 base pairs in length) with single open reading frames. The deduced amino acid sequences were highly homologous to each other and well matched with partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified serum I alpha TI. RNA blot analyses of liver RNAs with H- or L-chain cDNAs as probes clearly identified two distinct mRNAs of 3.3 and 1.3 kilobases, which corresponded to H or L chain, respectively. Poly(A)+ RNAs hybrid-selected with H-chain cDNAs coded for polypeptide chains of Mr 90,000-95,000. These results unambiguously establish that I alpha TI is made of multipolypeptides, possibly including one H and two L chains. The H chain contains potential calcium-binding sites and also regions homologous to the proposed reactive site for thiol-proteinase inhibitors. These data indicate that I alpha TI is a complex, multifunctional protein. mRNAs for both the H and L chains were found only in liver.\r"

A cDNA library in plasmids is then released by homologous recombination between the retroviral long terminal repeats. Retroviral transduction is achieved by transient expression of the released library in a cell line containing a packaging mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus, followed by cocultivation of these producers with recipient cells. Transcription of cDNAs in the recipient cells is driven by the strong long terminal repeat promoter, and the transcripts, even from truncated cDNAs, can be expressed because translational start sites have been provided in all three reading frames (tri-initiator). Sequences conferring a recognizable phenotype can be rescued by cell fusion. The functionality of the tri-initiator and the rescue of a rare cDNA have been successfully tested using model systems.\r"

Thus, it appears to be the smallest DNA polymerase ever isolated from prokaryotic cells. Comparison of the PRD1 DNA polymerase sequence with other DNA polymerase sequences that have been published yielded segmental but significant homologies. These results strongly suggest that many prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerase genes, regardless of size, have evolved from a common ancestral gene. The results further indicate that those DNA polymerases that use either an RNA or protein primer are related. We propose to classify DNA polymerases on the basis of their evolutionary relatedness.\r"

The cDNA clones were characterized by restriction mapping and automated DNA sequence analysis utilizing fluorescent dye primers. The rat heart muscarinic receptor consists of 466 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 51,543. The rat heart beta-adrenergic receptor consists of 418 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 46,890. The two cardiac receptors have substantial amino acid homology (27.2% identity, 50.6% with favored substitutions). The rat cardiac beta receptor has 88.0% homology (92.5% with favored substitutions) with the human brain beta receptor and the rat cardiac muscarinic receptor has 94.6% homology (97.6% with favored substitutions) with the porcine cardiac muscarinic receptor. The muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be as conserved as hemoglobin and cytochrome c but less conserved than histones and are clearly members of a multigene family. These data support our hypothesis, based upon biochemical and immunological evidence, that suggests considerable structural homology and evolutionary conservation between adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. To our knowledge, this is the first report utilizing automated DNA sequence analysis to determine the structure of a gene.\r"

We report here the cloning and characterization of WTV genome segment S5 [2613 base pairs (bp)] and three related DI RNAs (587-776 bp). Each DI RNA was generated by a simple internal deletion event that resulted in no sequence rearrangement at the deletion boundaries. Remarkably, although several DI RNAs have been in continuous passage for more than 20 years, their nucleotide sequences are identical to that of corresponding portions of segment S5 present in infrequently passaged, standard, transmission-competent virus. The positions of the deletion breakpoints indicate that the minimal sequence information required for replication and packaging of segment S5 resides within 319 bp from the 5' end of the (+)-strand and 205 bp from the 3' end of the (+)-strand. The terminal portions of segment S5 were found to contain a 9-bp inverted repeat immediately adjacent to the conserved terminal 5'-hexanucleotide and 3'-tetranucleotide sequences shared by all 12 WTV genome segments. The presence of a 6- to 9-nucleotide segment-specific inverted repeat immediately adjacent to the conserved terminal sequences was found to be a feature common to all WTV genome segments. These results reveal several basic principles that govern the replication and packaging of a segmented double-stranded RNA genome.\r"

The role of poly(A) addition in termination was established by introduction of several single base pair substitutions into the AATAAA polyadenylylation motifs.

  ".U": "88068588\r", 
  ".W": "Angiogenin is a potent inhibitor of cell-free protein synthesis. When incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate at a concentration of 40-60 nM, it completely abolishes the capacity of the lysate to support protein synthesis. The inhibition appears to be due to its ribonucleolytic activity since it (i) generates limited cleavage products from reticulocyte RNA and (ii) is prevented from both cleaving RNA and inhibiting protein synthesis by placental RNase inhibitor. The ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin toward the reticulocyte RNA system is highly specific. Thus, under conditions where angiogenin totally abolishes protein synthesis, an equivalent concentration of pancreatic RNase A inhibits it only partially. In contrast, RNase A is a much more effective enzyme than angiogenin using isolated RNA as substrate. Angiogenin inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving rRNA, thereby inactivating the protein synthesis machinery. Addition of isolated reticulocyte ribosomes to an angiogenin-treated lysate restores the capacity for protein synthesis, whereas addition of tRNA or mRNA does not. This potent effect on protein synthesis suggests a possible physiological function of angiogenin whose overall relevance and implications should become evident as the mechanisms of neovascularization are deciphered. The use of angiogenin may also further elucidate ribosome structure and its role in protein synthesis.\r"

MCt-III differs from a previous model, MCt-II, only by the substitution Leu15----Glu and is here compared with salmon calcitonin I (sCt-I) and MCt-II to elucidate further the role of the putative amphiphilic alpha-helix in determining biological and physical properties of the hormone. MCt-III shows physical properties intermediate between those of sCt-I and MCt-II, demonstrating the influence of appropriately positioned single residues on properties of amphiphilic structures. In our two biological assays, a brain-binding assay and an in vivo hypocalcemic assay, MCt-III reproduces the sigmoidal dose-response curves of sCt-I; this contrasts with the behavior of MCt-II, which demonstrated unusual dose-response curves in these two assays. MCt-III is almost three times more potent than sCt-I in our hypocalcemic assay; this activity groups MCt-III among the most potent known analogues of sCt-I.\r"

Evidence is presented here that another component of the primosome, replication factor Y, possesses DNA helicase activity as well. Factor Y helicase activity requires the presence of E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, Mg2+, and hydrolyzable ATP or dATP. Helicase activity is stimulated 15-fold when the enzyme is actively loaded onto single-stranded DNA through a primosome assembly site, and duplex DNA is unwound unidirectionally, 3'----5', along the DNA strand to which the protein is bound.\r"

Factors previously referred to as E4F1 and E2A-EF bind to the E4 and E2A promoters, respectively. We demonstrate here that E4F1 and E2A-EF have identical DNA-binding specificity. Moreover, E4F1 and E2A-EF both activate transcription of the E4 and E2A promoters in vitro. These findings demonstrate that E4F1 and E2A-EF are the same factor, which we have designated activating transcription factor, or ATF. In addition to the E4 and E2A promoters, ATF binds to an important functional element of the E1A-inducible E3 promoter. Interaction of a common activator protein, ATF, with multiple E1A-inducible early viral promoters, suggests a significant role for ATF in E1A-mediated transcriptional activation.\r"

The drug lies in the narrow minor groove near the center of the B-DNA fragment covering 5 of the 6 A.T base pairs. It is bound to the DNA by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions. In addition, the DNA was found to have an unusual conformation in the (dA)3.(dT)3 regions. These base pairs have a high positive propeller twist so that in the major groove the adenine amino group is located intermediate between the carbonyl O-4 groups of two adjacent thymines of the opposite strand, making bifurcated hydrogen bonds to the two thymine residues. This suggests a model to explain the unusual properties of poly-(dA).poly(dT) in which a modified B conformation is associated with a large propeller twist of the bases and a set of continuous bifurcating hydrogen bonds along the major groove, which may provide incremental stability to these segments. In addition, shorter segments of (dA)3-6.(dT)3-6 may have this conformation in the midst of B-DNA and stabilize bends in the DNA that may be associated with stacking on one of the high propeller-twisted bases at the ends of these segments.\r"

Mutant strain LO505 was specifically deficient in protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protoporphyrinogen-IX:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.3.4) activity, and thus it could not catalyze the penultimate step in heme biosynthesis. Soybean root nodules formed from this mutant did not contain leghemoglobin, but the apoprotein was synthesized nevertheless. Data show that bacterial heme synthesis is required for leghemoglobin expression, but the heme moiety is not essential for apoleghemoglobin synthesis by the plant. Soybean leghemoglobin, therefore, is a product of both the plant and bacterial symbionts.\r"

  ".W": "The polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs) are a group of disorders characterized by the growth of epithelial cysts from the nephrons and collecting ducts of kidney tubules. The diseases can be inherited or can be provoked by environmental factors. To investigate the molecular basis of the abnormal cell growth associated with PKD, c-myc protooncogene expression was studied in a mouse model for autosomal recessive PKD. Homozygous recessive C57BL/6J (cpk/cpk) mice develop massively enlarged cystic kidneys and die from renal failure shortly after 3 weeks of age. Quantitative dot blot and RNA blot hybridization experiments in which whole kidney poly(A)+ RNA was hybridized with a c-myc RNA probe showed a 2- to 6-fold increase in c-myc mRNA at 2 weeks, and a 25- to 30-fold increase in c-myc mRNA at 3 weeks of age in polycystic mice, as compared to normal littermates. c-myc expression was also examined under two conditions in which kidney cell growth was experimentally induced in normal adult mice: compensatory renal hypertrophy and tubule regeneration following folic acid-induced renal cell injury. While compensatory hypertrophy resulted in only a small (less than 3-fold) increase in c-myc, folic acid treatment gave rise after 24 hr to a 12-fold increase in c-myc mRNA. The induction of c-myc by folic acid is consistent with increased cellular proliferation in regenerating tubules. In contrast, polycystic kidneys show only a minimal increase in cellular proliferation over that seen in normal kidneys, while c-myc levels were found to be markedly elevated. Thus, the level of c-myc expression in cystic kidneys appears to be out of proportion to the rate of cell division, suggesting that elevated and potentially abnormal c-myc expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of PKD.\r"

Upon gel filtration, the RNAs are found within particles of molecular weights approximately equal to 150,000 and 115,000, respectively. The RNA of 145 nucleotides represents a different minor snRNA, designated U11, whereas the RNA of 66/65 nucleotides may correspond to either mammalian U7 or U10 RNA.\r"

Differential screening of these two libraries identified cloned sequences whose expression was either induced or repressed with IFN treatment. Rescreening of these sequences with cDNA probes constructed from proliferating or quiescent cells led to the identification of one IFN-induced and three IFN-repressed sequences whose expressions also appeared to be modulated by cell proliferation. Blot-hybridization analysis revealed that RNA levels corresponding to the three repressed genes decreased when HT1080 cells were treated with IFN or when proliferation of normal CUA foreskin fibroblast cells became naturally arrested by contact inhibition. Levels of RNA corresponding to the induced gene increased in HT1080 cells within 24 hr after IFN-treatment but declined below basal levels by 48 hr. Expression of these genes was unaffected or only slightly affected by IFN treatment in variant cells resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN. Collectively, these results suggest that the identified cDNAs correspond to genes that are involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN. Moreover, these results also suggest that IFN's antiproliferative action may be exerted through genes that contribute to arresting cell proliferation during contact inhibition.\r"

We have tested the efficacy of these methods for transfection of mammalian cells with exogenous DNA, using selection systems based either on resistance to the drug G418 (Geneticin) or on acquisition of the ability to utilize the salvage pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis. These loading methods can be employed to generate cell lines that express the gene product of the transfected DNA molecules both transiently and stably. Optimal transfection is observed when the DNA is added to cells in physiological saline lacking divalent cations and containing K+ in place of Na+. DNA molecules 7.1 to 30 kilobases long have been introduced by the scrape loading procedure. In addition, the scrape loading procedure has been employed for cotransfection and subsequent expression of nonselectable genes encoded on DNA molecules added in a mixture with DNA molecules whose expression is selected. Cell lines expressing oncogenes or proteins that are important for regulation of cell growth and division have been obtained by this procedure. The scrape loading procedure is also useful for studies of the cellular changes that occur upon expression of an exogenous gene. As many as 80% of cells scrape loaded with the plasmid pC6, which encodes the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, contained this protein in the nucleus between 1 and 5 days after transfection. Thus, scrape loading and sonication loading are simple, economical, and reproducible methods for introduction of DNA molecules into adherent and nonadherent cells, and these methods may be useful in the future for experimentation at both fundamental and applied levels.\r"

In the course of activation, these ferritin mRNAs are recruited onto polysomes. To elucidate the structural features of these mRNAs involved in the translational response to iron, a chimera was constructed from the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ferritin L subunit mRNA fused to the reading frame of the mRNA of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This chimera and deletion constructs derived from it were introduced into a rat hepatoma cell line by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The complete chimera showed increased CAT activity in response to iron enrichment of the medium, whereas deletion of the first 67 nucleotides of the 5' UTR, which contain a highly conserved sequence, caused loss of regulation by iron. Whereas cis-acting sequences located in the 5' flanking regions of many genes have been repeatedly implicated in modulating their transcriptional expression, we report here a specific regulatory translational sequence found within the 5' UTR of a eukaryotic mRNA.\r"

Though each of these yolk protein genes gains the capacity to respond to estradiol during embryonic development, we demonstrate that maximal responses for the different genes are achieved at distinct ages between 1 and 6 weeks after hatching. This observation prompted us to look for possible correlations between yolk protein gene expression and changes in the expression of estrogen receptors that might also occur after hatching. We discovered that indeed the maximal level of nuclear estrogen receptors (assayed following the administration of estradiol) increases progressively over this same period of development from approximately 1000 receptors per cell at 1 week after hatching to approximately 3500 receptors per cell at 6 weeks after hatching. The latter number represents the fully mature state, as comparable levels of receptors are present in the livers of egg-laying hens. Thus, though increases in the expression of estrogen receptors during embryonic liver development have previously been reported, our results indicate that the changes that occur after hatching are quantitatively far more significant to the developmental program for this transcription factor.\r"

Both theoretical and empirical considerations indicate that such genetic constraints will almost certainly be common in natural populations. It is shown that when genetic correlations between elements of social behavior exist, Hamilton's rule inaccurately describes the conditions for evolution by way of kin selection. The direction in which social organization evolves is a delicate function of the genetic covariance structure among behaviors expressed as an offspring, sibling, parent, etc. A change in this covariance structure caused by random genetic drift or by a change in environment for a population exhibiting genotype-environment interaction can cause the population to suddenly cross a threshold into a new selective domain. Consequently, radical changes in social organization may arise between closely related species without any major shift in selective pressures external to the population.\r"

R. meliloti strains containing mutations in the three nodD genes in all possible combinations were constructed and their nodulation phenotypes were assayed on Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Melilotus alba (sweet clover). A triple nodD1-nodD2-nodD3 mutant exhibited a Nod- phenotype on alfalfa and sweet clover, indicating that nodD is an essential nodulation gene in R. meliloti. A nodD2 mutant exhibited no discernable defect in nodulation and nodD3 mutants exhibited a delayed nodulation phenotype of 2-3 days when inoculated onto either host. Alfalfa nodules elicited by a nodD1 mutant appeared 5-6 days after wild-type nodules, and sweet clover nodules elicited by a nodD1 mutant appeared 2-3 days after wild-type nodules. nodD1-nodD2 double mutants formed nodules with the same delay as single nodD1 mutants on both hosts. nodD2-nodD3 double mutants elicited sweet clover nodules at the same rate as single nodD3 mutants, but this same double mutant was slightly more delayed in alfalfa nodule formation than the nodD3 mutant. The nodD1-nodD3 mutant exhibited an extremely delayed nodulation phenotype on alfalfa and elicited no nodules on sweet clover. These experiments indicate that nodD1 and nodD3 have equivalent roles in nodulating sweet clover but that nodD1 plays a more important role than nodD3 in eliciting nodules on alfalfa. The nodD2 gene appears to have some effect on alfalfa nodulation and none on sweet clover. Our results indicate that R. meliloti has three functional nodD genes that modulate the nodulation process in a host-specific manner.\r"

Three distinct epitopes within the myohemerythrin helix were identified. The individual residues within two of these epitopes that were essential for antibody binding were determined by measuring antibody binding to a set of peptides in which each amino acid of the epitope was replaced in turn by each of the other 19 amino acids. Hydrophilic residues that are exposed in the native conformation and buried, hydrophobic residues were both shown to be irreplaceable, suggesting their direct involvement in antibody binding. The influence of antigen conformation on antibody binding to these amphipathic epitopes was assessed by measuring the relative affinities of the antibodies for peptides, intact protein, and apoprotein. All of the antibodies bound to apoprotein better than to native protein, indicating that relaxation of the native structure by removal of the iron center increases antibody affinity for myohemerythrin. However, not all of the antibodies tested bound to peptides better than to protein, suggesting that increased antigen flexibility is not always sufficient to maximize antibody binding. Antibody binding to peptides appeared to also be influenced by the ability of the peptides to attain secondary structure at the epitopes, either alone or due to carrier influences.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the toxic manifestations of overwhelming bacterial infection and in the tissue wasting that often accompanies prolonged infections and malignancy. We have examined a possible role of TNF in the early metabolic alterations following acute tissue injury or sepsis. Recombinant human TNF stimulated rat liver amino acid uptake up to 5-fold in vivo and there was a concomitant increase in plasma glucagon. In vitro TNF had no direct effect on hepatocyte amino acid uptake, but it markedly enhanced the stimulation of amino acid transport by glucagon, without an alteration in binding of glucagon to hepatocytes. This permissive effect of TNF on glucagon action represents an interrelationship between the immune and endocrine systems, and it may help to explain the mechanism of hormonal regulation of both the anabolic and catabolic responses to acute injury.\r"

A total dose of 14 nmol of either diol epoxide was administered to preweanling mice, and tumorigenic activity was determined when the mice were 32 to 36 weeks old. At the termination of the study, 13% of solvent-treated control mice had developed lung tumors with an average of 0.19 tumor per mouse. No other tumors were observed in control animals. (+)-B[a]P diol epoxide-2 induced pulmonary tumors in 60% of the mice with an average of 1.9 tumors per mouse, and 14% of the male mice developed hepatic tumors with an average of 0.18 tumor per mouse. In contrast, 6-FB[a]P diol epoxide-2 had no significant tumorigenic activity at the 14-nmol dose. Although both bay-region diol epoxides have the same absolute configuration, (7R,8S,9S,10R), the hydroxyl groups of (+)-B[a]P diol epoxide-2 prefer the pseudoequatorial conformation whereas the hydroxyl groups of 6-FB[a]P diol epoxide-2 prefer the pseudoaxial conformation. The tumorigenicity results reported here are the first direct demonstration that conformation of the hydroxyl groups in a bay-region diol epoxide, in addition to the documented effect of absolute configuration, is an important determinant in the tumorigenic activity of these ultimate carcinogens.\r"

Microinjection of 270 pmol of naloxone into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) significantly inhibited the hypotensive and bradycardic response to 5 nmol of similarly administered clonidine in both SHR and normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats. In SHR, a similar inhibition was observed after the delta-opiate receptor antagonist ICI 174864, but not after the mu-receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (both at 270 pmol, intra-NTS), whereas in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats, beta-funaltrexamine, but not ICI 174864, was an effective inhibitor. The same pattern of differential inhibition was seen when clonidine was given i.v. and the opiate antagonists were given intracisternally in SHR and Sprague-Dawley rats. Intra-NTS microinjection of 280 fmol of beta-endorphin caused hypotension and bradycardia, and these effects were similarly inhibited by ICI 174864 in SHR and by beta-funaltrexamine in Sprague-Dawley rats. In Sprague-Dawley rats made hypertensive by chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone pivalate and salt, the hypotensive and bradycardic effects of intra-NTS clonidine were inhibited by ICI 174864, but not by beta-funaltrexamine, a pattern similar to that in SHR, but different from that in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats. These results support the hypothesis that beta-endorphin release and subsequent stimulation of opiate receptors in the NTS are involved in the cardiovascular effects of clonidine in rats. These results further suggest, however, that hypertension regulates the subtype of opiate receptors mediating these effects.\r"

Complete Freund's adjuvant or saponin was used as adjuvant. When vaccinated mice were challenged with 500 sporozoites almost all animals became infected. There were no significant protective effects in vaccinated versus unvaccinated mice. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the antibody titer to the CS repeats and infection. The parasites from infected animals were shown to encode a CS protein containing the same repeats as those used for immunization, indicating that the infections were not due to selection for variant parasites. These experiments demonstrate that antibodies to the CS repeats, as derived in vivo with peptides, despite being surface reactive, do not provide protection against sporozoite challenge in vivo. This conclusion is in contrast to previous conclusions based on studies showing protection by way of in vitro sporozoite neutralization procedures and passive transfer of monoclonal antibody.\r"

We constructed the vector pFr-SV(X). The Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer region of a vector, pZIP-SV(X), was replaced by a 380-nucleotide-long fragment containing the enhancer sequences of the Friend murine leukemia virus. The enhancer sequences of Friend murine leukemia virus were used because these sequences have been shown to target the disease specificity of the virus to the erythroid lineage. Hematopoietic progenitors in murine continuous marrow cultures were infected with identical numbers of pure defective, infectious viral vector particles of either pFr-SV(X) or pZIP-SV(X). Expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene in multipotential stem cells and their differentiated progeny was assayed as the ability of infected progenitors to form colonies (greater than 50 cells) in G418. Expression of the neomycin resistance gene in multipotential progenitor cells during the entire 11 weeks of the cultures was independent of the vector used to transfer the gene. Conversely, committed hemoglobinized erythroid bursts and myeloid colonies resistant to G418 were consistently produced by pFr-SV(X)-infected cultures but not pZIP-SV(X)-infected cultures. These results demonstrate that both pFr-SV(X) and pZIP-SV(X) were stably integrated and expressed in more primitive, multilineage, hematopoietic progenitor cells and suggest that the enhancer sequences of a vector affects expression of the transferred neomycin resistance gene when these cells differentiate to committed myeloid and erythroid cells.\r"

  ".W": "Rat superior cervical sympathetic ganglion was used to begin studying the regulation of molecular components of the synapse. Ganglionic postsynaptic densities (PSDs)exhibited a thin, disc-shaped profile electron microscopically, comparable to that described for brain. Moreover, the presumptive ganglionic PSD protein (PSDp) was phosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, bound 125I-labeled calmodulin, and exhibited a Mr of 51,000, all characteristic of the major PSD protein of brain. These initial studies indicated that ganglionic PSDp and the major PSD protein of brain are comparable, allowing us to study synaptic regulation in the well-defined superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. To obtain enough quantities of ganglionic PSDp, we used synaptic membrane fractions. During postnatal development, calmodulin binding to the ganglionic PSDp increased 411-fold per ganglion from birth to 60 days, whereas synaptic membrane protein increased only 4.5-fold. Consequently, different synaptic components apparently develop differently. Moreover, denervation of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion in adult rats caused an 85% decrease in ganglionic PSDp-calmodulin binding, but denervation caused no change in synaptic membrane protein 2 weeks postoperatively. Our observations suggest that presynaptic innervation selectively regulates specific molecular components of the postsynaptic membrane structure.\r"

We took advantage of these large differentiated blastomeres, which were amenable to electrophysiological recordings, to compare Na channels in the egg cell and those in the neurally differentiated blastomere. The macroscopic Na current in the differentiated blastomere showed a marked slow-decaying component in addition to a fast one, whereas in the egg the fast-decaying component was predominant. Both the I-V relationship and the steady-state inactivation curve shifted about 8 mV in the positive direction in the neurally differentiated blastomere compared with those in the egg cell. Furthermore, single-channel current recordings revealed that Na channels reopened more frequently in the differentiated blastomere than in the egg cell. This characteristic of the channel corresponded well to the marked slow-decaying component of the macroscopic current in the differentiated blastomere. The single-channel conductance was similar in both types of cells. We conclude that the neurally differentiated blastomere expresses a Na channel that has properties of inactivation kinetics distinct from those of the egg-type Na channel and that no detectable egg-type channel coexists in the neurally differentiated blastomeres.\r"

Although these permeability changes in nerve and muscle are mediated by voltage-gated Na channels that are functionally similar, we found that the Na-channel gene expressed in skeletal muscle is different from the genes coding for two Na channels (type I and type II) in brain. Despite the structural differences between muscle and brain Na-channel genes, a cDNA clone derived from rat brain hybridizes to skeletal muscle Na-channel mRNA of approximately 9.5 kilobases. We used this cDNA probe to measure changes in Na-channel mRNA levels in skeletal muscle during development and following denervation. By blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA, we found that Na-channel mRNA can be detected as early as embryonic day 17 and that mRNA levels increase 2-fold between birth and postnatal day 35. Denervation of adult muscle causes a further 2- to 3-fold increase in muscle Na-channel mRNA levels, suggesting that expression of Na-channel genes in fast-twitch muscle may be regulated by the state of innervation.\r"

  ".W": "The choice of which neurotransmitters will be produced by a developing neuron is influenced by the microenvironment of the neuron. In this study we show that neuronal contact with membrane-associated molecules promotes expression of peptidergic and cholinergic traits. Treatment of cultured neonatal rat sympathetic neurons with plasma membranes derived from adult rat spinal cord or sympathetic ganglia induced expression of the peptide transmitter substance P and increased levels of the cholinergic biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The transmitter-stimulating activity could be solubilized from spinal cord membranes by the detergent octyl glucoside but not by Triton X-100. The choline acetyltransferase- and substance P-stimulating activity also could be extracted from spinal cord membranes by 4 M sodium chloride, suggesting that the active material is membrane associated rather than an intrinsic structural membrane molecule. Trypsin or heat treatment of the extract destroyed the transmitter-stimulating activity, indicating that the factor contains a protein. Activity also was destroyed by hyaluronidase treatment, suggesting that the active material may contain a glycosaminoglycan. The choline acetyltransferase-stimulating activity in the 4 M NaCl extract was eluted in a single peak from a calibrated Sephadex G-75 column with a retention time slightly less than that of a 25-kDa standard. NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the active peak revealed a predominant band at 29 kDa. Thus, contact-mediated stimulation of substance P and choline acetyltransferase activity in sympathetic neurons results from neuronal exposure to a 29-kDa membrane-associated factor.\r"

  ".U": "88068664\r", 
  ".W": "In newborn rats the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA (mRNANGF) and NGF receptor mRNA (mRNA(rec)) in the sciatic nerve were 10 and 120 times higher, respectively, than in adult animals. mRNA(rec) levels decreased steadily from birth, approaching adult levels by the third postnatal week, whereas mRNANGF levels decreased only after the first postnatal week, although also reaching adult levels by the third week. Transection of the adult sciatic nerve resulted in a marked biphasic increase in mRNANGF with time. On the proximal side of the cut, this increase was confined to the area immediately adjacent to the cut; peripherally, a similar biphasic increase was present in all segments. mRNA(rec) levels were also markedly elevated distal to the transection site, in agreement with previous results obtained by immunological methods [Taniuchi, M., Clark, H. B. & Johnson, E. M., Jr. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 4094-4098]. Following a crush lesion (allowing regeneration), the mRNA(rec) levels were rapidly down-regulated as the regenerating nerve fibers passed through the distal segments. Down-regulation of mRNANGF also occurred during regeneration but was slower and not as extensive as that of mRNA(rec) over the time period studied. Changes in mRNANGF and mRNA(rec) occurring in vivo after transection were compared with those observed in pieces of sciatic nerve kept in culture. No difference was found for mRNA(rec). Only the initial rapid increase in mRNANGF occurred in culture, but the in vivo situation could be mimicked by the addition of activated macrophages. This reflects the situation in vivo where, after nerve lesion, macrophages infiltrate the area of the Wallerian degeneration. These results suggest that mRNANGF synthesis in sciatic non-neuronal cells is regulated by macrophages, whereas mRNA(rec) synthesis is determined by axonal contact.\r"

The spatial phase dependence of the response to contrast-reversing gratings was consistent with a high degree of linearity of spatial summation within the receptive fields. Furthermore, the preferred direction predicted from the response to stationary gratings generally agreed with the measurements made with drifting gratings. The amount of directional selectivity predicted was, on average, about half the measured value, indicating that nonlinear mechanisms act in concert with linear mechanisms in determining the overall directional selectivity.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin, somatotropin release-inhibiting factor (SRIF), is a regulatory peptide that has proved to directly inhibit parietal cell acid secretion. However, the therapeutic usefulness of SRIF has been limited by a brief plasma half-life. Several analogues of SRIF that are effective in suppressing acid secretion in vivo have been developed. This study was undertaken to compare the effects of SRIF and two analogues, SMS 201-995 and L-363,568, on in vitro acid secretion. We used isolated rabbit parietal cells prepared by collagenase digestion and counterflow elutriation. Acid secretion was assessed by the accumulation of 14C-aminopyrine within the cells. Two types of secretagogues were utilized: histamine (10(-6) mol/L), a membrane receptor agonist which acts by means of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP, and forskolin (10(-6) mol/L), a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. SRIF, SMS 201-995, and L-363,568 (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol/L) all significantly inhibited histamine-stimulated 14C-AP uptake (p less than 0.001). On a molar basis, SMS 201-995 was 10 times more potent and L-363,568 was 40 times more potent than SRIF. SRIF, SMS 201-995, and L-363,568 significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated 14C-AP uptake (p less than 0.005). The inhibitory effects of SRIF and both analogues on forskolin-stimulated acid secretion was, however, significantly less than that observed with histamine (p less than 0.05). These results demonstrate increased in vitro potency of SRIF analogues compared with the native peptide. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that SRIF and its analogues function at more than one site within the parietal cell.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have documented beneficial effects of the somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (hereafter referred to as SMS), when administered subcutaneously to patients with a variety of disorders. Since SMS is a small peptide, we tested the ability of two penetrant enhancers--dimethylsulfoxide and N-decylmethylsulfoxide (C10MS)--to promote transcutaneous passage of SMS. Samples of skin from human cadavers and hairless mice were tested in a static diffusion chamber. Application of SMS in conjunction with 1% C10MS resulted in rapid transdermal passage of SMS. These data were confirmed for hairless mouse skin in experiments with a modified diffusion chamber having continuous flow-through of receptor fluid in the subdermal reservoir. In this system, the cumulative amount of SMS that permeated hairless mouse skin was 20 micrograms/cm2/24 hours. Topical application of SMS with C10MS beneath a patch to mice confirmed in vitro data. Topical application of 10 micrograms of SMS resulted in plasma SMS levels of greater than 8,000 pg/ml within 2 hours. We conclude that SMS will cross both human and mouse skin, with a clinically significant flux, when administered topically with C10MS. The data support the feasibility of in vivo human trials of topical SMS therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88071235\r", 
  ".W": "Somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) has been shown to decrease total serum gastrin in patients with gastrinoma; however, the gastrin level rarely returns to normal, despite the near-complete inhibition of acid secretion. This implies that SMS may have an inhibitory action on the biologically active molecular species of gastrin and have little effect on biologically inactive species. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of SMS on the molecular species of gastrin in eight patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Serum obtained before treatment and 6 hours and 18 hours after treatment (SMS 1 microgram/kg, subcutaneously) was sampled and assayed for molecular species of gastrin by means of gel filtration chromatography and fractional quantitation of gastrin species by radioimmunoassay. There was a significant decrease in the amount of G-34 and G-17 species. BBG and G-14 decreased, a change not significant at 6 hours but significant 18 hours after SMS. The distribution of the various molecular species as a percent of total immunoreactive gastrin was analyzed before and after SMS. There was a shift in the distribution of the molecular species, so that 6 hours after SMS treatment nearly 50% of total gastrin activity was accounted for by BBG and component I. SMS seems to have a different potency to inhibit release of the various gastrin molecular species. This observation may explain the failure of total gastrin levels to return to normal after SMS treatment in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"

Normal or reactive promyelocytes were characterized by prominent paranuclear clear Golgi zones, whereas promyelocytes from true leukemic cases all had heavy azurophilic granules dispersed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Prominent Golgi zones in promyelocytes were associated only with benign myeloid conditions and were not observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Our results indicate that the CF gene in Hutterite families segregates with chromosome 7 markers, identified by probes metH and pJ3.11. Thus, the CF mutation in Hutterites is likely to be either at the same locus as or at one closely linked to that reported in outbred populations. Heterozygous carriers could be distinguished from normal homozygous sibs of affected individuals. In the families studied, three different chromosome 7 haplotypes carried the CF mutation, raising the possibility that the CF gene may have been introduced into this population by as many as three different ancestors.\r"

In contrast, irradiation profoundly depleted MMC even though enteropathy was more severe than in non-irradiated hosts. We suggest that enteropathy is not dependent on the presence of MMC.

Neurokinins (substance P [SP] and congeners) provoke contraction, and kinins (bradykinin) provoke relaxation. Both peptide categories promote the release of relaxing prostaglandins that oppose the contractions induced by neurokinins and mediate entirely the relaxations by the kinins. Receptors for neurokinins have been characterized by comparing the effects of a variety of agonists (naturally occurring or synthetic peptides) in the guinea pig trachea and in other selective preparations. It has been found that the guinea pig trachea contains receptors for neurokinin A (NKA) and for substance P. This has been demonstrated by showing that selective activators of the neurokinin A receptor type are potent stimulants of contraction, and that selective stimulants of the receptors for SP are also active contractile agonists. The order of potency for the neurokinins is NKA greater than NKB greater than SP. The relaxations of guinea pig trachea provoked by bradykinin is not due to the activation of B1 or B2 receptors since it is not modified by specific B1 or B2 antagonists. It is suggested that bradykinin may promote the release of prostaglandins either through a third receptor or by an unknown mechanism. These studies show that the isolated guinea pig trachea is a complex preparation, composed of various tissues and containing different types of neurokinin receptors. The preparation also contains endogenous active agents (e.g., prostaglandins) that are released by the peptides and that may modify or partially or entirely mediate the biologic effects of peptides.\r"

All but one had received prophylactic cranial irradiation (1800-2400 cGy) and three children had received additional cranial or craniospinal irradiation as treatment for relapse of their leukaemia. Mean age for the onset of puberty was 8.8 (SD 0.8) years in the girls and 9.3 (0.8) years in the boys; this is greater than two standard deviations from the mean for normal girls and boys. Five children (three girls, two boys) had precocious puberty. The onset of puberty occurred at greater than two standard deviations from the mean for normal girls and boys in 14(13%) girls and 4(3%) boys treated at less than eight years of age between 1970 and 1985. In a group of 55 girls treated for ALL who had survived in first remission for six years or more from diagnosis, there was a relation between young age at onset of treatment and early menarche. We suggest that premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis occurs as a consequence of hypothalamic dysfunction due to cranial irradiation. Precocious and premature puberty in children treated for ALL may be an important factor in contributing to short stature.\r"

Thirteen (86%) of 15 examinations were successful, and 100% of successful examinations showed metabolic abnormality in the tumor. Tumors contained excess adenosine triphosphate and inorganic phosphate, an unusual peak of phosphomonoester, consistent with excessive glycolysis in tumors. The intratumor pH was normal in the 12 bone tumors, but acidic in the single soft-tissue sarcoma (pH 6.8). Metabolic response was observed in all seven patients monitored during chemotherapy, with the earliest examinations being performed two days after first treatment. An increase in the inorganic phosphate level, loss of adenosine triphosphate, and loss of phosphomonoester indicated tumor response; loss of all abnormal metabolites (two of seven patients) indicated regression of the tumor. Tumor relapse was accompanied by reappearance of abnormalities in the magnetic resonance spectrum. Phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy offers a unique means of determining the early response of these malignant tumors to therapy as well as predicting their relapse.\r"

Fibroblasts lines cultured from normal skin (HSF) were compared with those from lesional (PSA) and non-lesional (PSB) psoriatic skin. In general, the retinoids inhibited proliferation; the action was cytostatic, in rank order tretinoin greater than isotretinoin greater than etretin greater than arotinoid. The psoriatic cells tended to be more sensitive than the HSF lines, overall mean proliferation values (+/- SEM), as a percentage of untreated controls being: HSF 72 ++- 3, PSA 61 +/- 3 and PSB 54 +/- 3. Stimulation of GAG secretion at low concentrations (10(-7) M) of all four retinoids, declined as concentrations increased, and secretion was inhibited at 10(-4)M in PSB fibroblasts. Calculation of effects on GAG secretion due to changes in cell density confirmed the rank order for direct stimulation of secretion as arotinoid greater than etretin greater than isotretinoin greater than tretinoin. Electrophoresis of [3H]-labelled glycosaminoglycans secreted in the presence of 10(-7) M arotinoid showed that it was predominantly hyaluronic acid, as in untreated cells. These data confirm that different retinoids have contrasting levels of effects on mesenchymal cells and suggest a greater sensitivity to drugs in fibroblasts from psoriatic skin.\r"

The production of prostaglandin (PG) E2, F2 alpha and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) by isolated glomeruli, cortical tubular suspensions and medullary and papillary slices was measured in normal Long-Evans rats 4, 8 and 14 days after starting on oral Na+ load and the results were compared with those of rats on a normal Na+ intake. 2. In glomeruli, PGE2 decreased at days 4 and 8, and returned to normal at 14 days. PGF2 alpha decreased only at day 4 and TXB2 decreased in all Na+-loaded animals. In cortical suspensions, a transient decrease of PGE2 was observed at day 4. In medullary slices, PGE2 and TXB2 decreased in all experimental periods. In contrast, in papillae, a significant increase of PGE2 was observed with Na+ loading at day 8, but PGF2 alpha and TXB2 did not change consistently. 3. Similar changes were observed in rats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI rats) Na+ loaded for 4 days, as compared with DI rats on a normal Na+ intake. 4. The results suggest that prostanoids participate in the renal adaptation to an increased Na+ intake, and that this response is relatively independent of the presence of antidiuretic hormone.\r"

  ".W": "The normal fluid absorption across the gallbladder mucosa is, in experimental cholecystitis, changed to an active net fluid secretion. This fluid secretion, studied in anesthetized cats, is not abolished by extrinsic gallbladder denervation and is unaffected by atropine but is strongly reduced by intraarterial tetrodotoxin or intraluminal administration of lidocaine hydrochloride. Intravenous somatostatin or hexamethonium administration also reduce this secretion. Indomethacin, known to abolish this fluid secretion, did not further reduce it when administered after nerve blocking agents in the present study. These data demonstrate that the prostaglandin-induced gallbladder fluid secretion in experimental cholecystitis is influenced by intramural nerves. It is suggested that gallbladder inflammation is associated with prostaglandin-induced activation of intrinsic nerves which may stimulate the epithelial cells to fluid secretion. In the obstructed gallbladder, this secretion causes gallbladder distension by increasing the intraluminal pressure. This mechanism may have a key role in the pathophysiology of acute cholecystitis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) modulates cholinergic neurotransmission in airway smooth muscle and, if so, what the mechanism of action is, we studied bronchial segments from dogs under isometric conditions in vitro. PGD2 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) elicited dose-dependent muscle contraction, which was reduced after blockade of muscarinic receptors, so that 50% effective dose (ED50) increased from 1.3 +/- 0.3 X 10(-6) to 3.9 +/- 1.0 X 10(-6) M by atropine (10(-6) M) (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.05). Physostigmine, at a concentration insufficient to alter base-line tension (10(-8) M), enhanced the PGD2-induced contraction and decreased ED50 to 6.4 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) M (P less than 0.05). When added at the highest doses that did not cause spontaneous contraction (1.9 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) M), PGD2 increased the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (1-50 Hz) by 21.9 +/- 6.6% (P less than 0.001). In contrast to this effect, the response to administered acetylcholine was not affected by PGD2. On the other hand, PGD2-induced augmentation of the response to electrical field stimulation (5 Hz) was further increased from 23.6 +/- 3.0 to 70.4 +/- 8.8% in the presence of physostigmine (10(-8) M) and was abolished by atropine but not affected by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine or the histamine H1-blocker pyrilamine. These results suggest that the contraction of airway smooth muscle induced by PGD2 is in in part mediated by a cholinergic action and that PGD2 prejunctionally augments the parasympathetic contractile response, likely involving the accelerated release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of endogenous enkephalinase (EC 3.4.24.11) in regulating peptide-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle, we studied the effect of the enkephalinase inhibitor, leucine-thiorphan (Leu-thiorphan), on responses of isolated ferret tracheal smooth muscle segments to substance P (SP) and to electrical field stimulation (EFS). Leu-thiorphan shifted the dose-response curve to SP to lower concentrations. Atropine or the SP antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP significantly inhibited SP-induced contractions in the presence of Leu-thiorphan. Leu-thiorphan increased the contractile responses to EFS dose dependently, an effect that was significantly inhibited by the SP antagonist [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP. SP, in a concentration that did not cause contraction, increased the contractile responses to EFS. This effect was augmented by Leu-thiorphan dose dependently and was not inhibited by hexamethonium or by phentolamine but was inhibited by atropine. Because contractile responses to acetylcholine were not significantly affected by SP or by Leu-thiorphan, the potentiating effects of SP were probably on presynaptic-postganglionic cholinergic neurotransmission. Captopril, bestatin, or leupeptin did not augment contractions, suggesting that enkephalinase was responsible for the effects. These results suggest that endogenous tachykinins modulate smooth muscle contraction and endogenous enkephalinase modulates contractions produced by endogenous or exogenous tachykinins and tachykinin-induced facilitation of cholinergic neurotransmission.\r"

Dentofacial balance must be considered to truly enhance a patient's potential to achieve the optimal dentofacial esthetic appearance and enhance self-image.

Overall, survival rates were 60%, 30%, and 7% at five, 10, and 20 years, respectively. The incidence of local recurrence was 37%, regional recurrence 3%, and distant metastasis 37%. Fewer recurrences and distant metastases were in the SEPI group than the surgery alone group. The majority of failures occurred within 10 years after initial diagnosis of primary malignancy; most of the patients died within five years after failure(s) detection. Correlations of prognosis to site of origin, and local control to total radiotherapy dose were observed. It is concluded that cure of disease can be achieved with the use of appropriate therapy.\r"

All specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. In addition to bacterial culture samples, a portion of the sinus membrane was resected and examined microscopically for the presence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate. Eighty per cent (16/20) of the patients studied showed no bacterial growth from any sinus specimen. The remaining 20% (four of 20) had some bacterial growth, but in negligible numbers. Microscopically, all mucosal specimens showed some degree of inflammatory cell infiltrate, but the specimens where bacteria were present showed a more acute inflammatory response. It was concluded that the asymptomatic adult maxillary sinus is usually sterile, but that a few transient bacteria may exist in a clinically silent antrum. When bacteria are present, they are recognized as foreign and elicit the appropriate inflammatory responses.\r"

Ninety-two consecutive patients received a total of 355 block implants to the maxilla (294), mandible (41), and midface (20). There were 202 implants positioned directly adjacent to the maxillary sinus. Complications were minimal, the most common being exposure of the implant to the oral or nasal cavity. Histologic evaluation of implants that were biopsied in nine patients, four to 16 months postsurgery, revealed connective tissue ingrowth throughout the implants with approximately one-third being bone of variable maturity and two-thirds being soft tissue.\r"

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tissues were obtained at four and 10 days, four, 20, 52, and 78 weeks after surgery, and compared to TMJ tissues in unoperated control animals. No clinically observable changes in weight, occlusion, or jaw function were identified. All the surgical sites healed normally. At necropsy, lesions of the articular surface of the condyle were apparent in areas that had been surgically \"shaved.\" The anterior, intermediate, and posterior zones of the surgically-treated discs were generally free of change. Two cryosurgically-treated discs showed lesions and perforations. Histologic and autoradiographic observations suggested that the bilaminar area heals quickly with minimal scarring, following both conventional surgical manipulation and cryosurgery. Under the conditions of this experiment the cryosurgical technique was judged not to be superior to the conventional surgical approach.\r"

  ".U": "88090535\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the roles of endogenous enkephalinase (EC.3.4.24.11) in regulating tachykinin-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle, the authors studied the effects of the enkephalinase inhibitor leucine-thiorphan on the contractile responses to substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) in isolated ferret tracheal smooth muscle segments. Leucine-thiorphan shifted, in concentration-dependent fashions, the dose-response curves to all tachykinins to lower concentrations. Leucine-thiorphan changed the rank order of tachykinin potency from NKA greater than SP greater than NKB to NKA = NKB greater than SP. Removal of the epithelium slightly enhanced the contractile responses to SP and NKA but not to NKB. Atropine shifted the dose-response curves of all tachykinins to higher concentrations. Each tachykinin increased the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (5 Hz, 20 sec of duration, 20 V) in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was not altered by hexamethonium, indomethacin, BW755C or naloxone but was potentiated by leucine-thiorphan and inhibited by the tachykinin receptor antagonist (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)-SP and by atropine. Because tachykinins did not affect contractile responses to acetylcholine significantly, their effects were probably on presynaptic postganglionic nerves. Captopril, bestatin and leupeptin did not alter contractile responses, suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases and serine proteinases did not modulate tachykinin-induced effects. Enkephalinase immunofluorescence was found in the smooth muscle and epithelium and confirmed the authors' finding of enkephalinase-like activity in the muscle. The results suggest that tracheal enkephalinase is an important modulator of tachykinin-induced effects.\r"

The mechanism of phorbol ester-induced contraction is unknown. We studied the Ca++-dependence of, and the degree of myosin light chain phosphorylation (MLC-P), during PDB-induced contractions in rabbit aortic rings. PDB elicited concentration-dependent contractions (3 X 10(-8) to 10(-6) M) in rabbit aortic rings incubated in normal (1.6 mM Ca++) physiologic salt solution (PSS). Addition of the Ca++-channel blocker nifedipine (0.1 microM) to PSS or removal or Ca++ from PSS significantly reduced the contractile responses to PDB. Depletion of Ca++ by repeated washes in O Ca++-PSS containing 10(-3) M ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid reduced, but did not eliminate, the responses to PDB. In PSS, PDB significantly increased the fraction of phosphorylated MLC/total MLC to 0.33 from a resting value of 0.20. Ca++ depletion reduced the resting fraction (MLC-P/MLC) to 0.14. PDB-stimulated contractions in Ca++-depleted tissues occurred in the absence of significant increases in MLC-P. Sodium nitroprusside partially relaxed PDB-induced contractions by approximately 50% whether elicited in the presence of 1.6 mM Ca++ or after Ca++ depletion. In both cases relaxation occurred in the absence of statistically significant decreases in MLC phosphorylation. Ca++-dependent MLC phosphorylation may account for a component of the PDB contractile response in rabbit aorta. Studies in the absence of Ca++ suggest that PDB may activate contraction without concomitant MLC-P.\r"

Base-line loop chloride reabsorption was determined in the presence and absence of indomethacin in a third and fourth group perfused with a similar solution with furosemide omitted. Arterial pressure, whole kidney inulin clearance and urinary chloride excretion were not different among groups. Fractional loop chloride reabsorption was less (P less than .05) in vehicle-treated rats perfused with furosemide than in time control rats perfused without furosemide (30.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 50.3 +/- 2.8%). Fractional chloride reabsorption was greater (P less than .05) in furosemide-perfused loops of indomethacin-treated rats than furosemide-perfused loops of vehicle-treated rats (44.2 +/- 1.9 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.8%). Addition of 10(-4) M prostaglandin E2 to perfusate did not potentiate furosemide's effect in vehicle-treated rats but restored furosemide's potency in indomethacin-treated rats. Thus, indomethacin had no effect on base-line loop chloride uptake but attenuated furosemide's luminal effect. This response could be reversed by luminal prostaglandin E2. This study demonstrates that indomethacin antagonizes furosemide's tubular effects in the absence of furosemide-induced vasodilatation.\r"

Statistical modeling of data for the period 1960-84 revealed that both the age effects and the cohort effects were different for each site. While younger cohorts apparently had signs of reduced risk of both diseases, reduced risk was only apparent among the very youngest cohorts in the case of breast cancer, whereas there has been a gradual reduction in the risk of colon cancer among successive cohorts born since the beginning of the century. Clemmesen's hook was demonstrated in the age-incidence curve of breast cancer, which was clearly shown to have two different slopes: among premenopausal and among postmenopausal women. The declining risk of breast cancer in younger cohorts appeared contradictory to their apparently \"high-risk\" profile (in terms of present knowledge of etiologic factors) and suggested the possible existence of a factor that protects against breast cancer, at least at younger ages, but that remains, as yet, unidentified.\r"

A pair of cell lines was initiated from a superficial spreading melanoma and the lymph node of the same patient; four others were also autologous, three of which originated from the same nodular melanoma and the other from its metastasis. Cell lines varied in pigmentation level and ability to grow in nude mice. Cell lines contained similar amounts of total cholesterol, glycerides, and phospholipids but different amounts of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters. In particular, the molar ratio of free cholesterol to phospholipid was increased in highly tumorigenic cell lines. No changes in phospholipid profiles were noted among cell lines, except an increase in sphingomyelin with a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylcholine in one cell line compared to the profiles of its counterpart cell line. The saturated-to-unsaturated fatty acid ratios in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were similar in all cell lines, but the monounsaturated-to-polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio in phosphatidylcholine was increased in highly tumorigenic cell lines. A significant variation in the latter ratio in phosphatidylethanolamine was also observed in the pair of autologous cell lines. These changes were unrelated to a depletion in linoleic acid in culture medium. Results obtained by fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene were consistent with the differences in lipid composition between two autologous cell lines. The present results indicate that two lipid characteristics were significantly changed in highly tumorigenic cell lines as compared to cell lines with low tumorigenicity, but no correlation was found between either pigmentation level or origin (primary or metastatic) and lipid composition.\r"

The patients were found to have significantly higher free E2 and free T (in terms of the percentage of the total) than did controls. Conversely, percentages of SHBG-bound E2 and albumin-bound E2 were not significantly different for patients and controls. The SHBG binding capacity was significantly smaller in postmenopausal, but not in premenopausal, patients. Free E2 and free T were found to be negatively correlated with the SHBG binding capacity in both patients and controls. A significant negative correlation also was noted between the percentage of free E2 or free T and the age of controls. The percentage of free T was positively correlated with body weight for both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. These results suggest a possibility that the elevation of free E2 in the serum may be one of the potential risk factors for genesis of breast cancer in Japanese women.\r"

The cancer experience of the patients, their offspring, siblings, parents, parental siblings, and grandparents was compared to that expected of the general population based on age-, sex- and calendar year-specific rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. A significant excess of SMNs was observed in the patients (observed expected = 8:0.38). Among 758 first-degree relatives, a significant cancer excess was observed (34:20.68), attributable largely to cancer of soft tissue and bone (6:0.44) and breast (9:3.39) and to cancers occurring before age 35 years (12:4.14). Overall, a significantly lower than expected cancer incidence was confirmed in the 1,693 second-degree relatives (142:178). To identify patient characteristics associated with higher than expected familial cancer risk, kindreds were partitioned by patient age at diagnosis tumor type, tumor site SMN and other factors. A highly significant cancer excess was observed in the relatives of SMN patients (26:12.78). The tumor types occurring in excess in close relatives were also observed as SMNs in the patients. The findings confirm an association among childhood soft tissue sarcoma and cancers of the breast, bone, joint, or soft tissue as SMN in patients and in close relatives and suggest that the risk of a second tumor is associated with a familial predisposition to cancer.\r"

Thirty-three women in good health were randomly allocated to commence either a standard diet (deriving 40% of their energy from fat) or a low-fat diet (deriving 20% of their energy from fat). After 2 months, the women were crossed over to the alternative diet for another 2 months. Serum hormone and lipid levels were measured in the middle and at the end of each dietary period. In premenopausal women, the low-fat diet appeared to decrease levels of both non-protein-bound estradiol (1.48 down to 1.27%; P = .07) and non-protein-bound testosterone (1.06 down to 0.86%; P = .11). Cholesterol levels were lowered by the low-fat diet and were significantly associated with estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was associated with estradiol and prolactin. For the postmenopausal women, the low-fat diet lowered cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels, but there were not the same associations with the hormones. These findings add weight to the concept that attention to diet may be a means of reducing the incidence of breast cancer in our community.\r"

DNA polymerase alpha isolated from fetal cells contained a single, high-specific-activity enzyme form that could not be further activated and that was stable with regard to enzyme activity and affinity for DNA template-primer. DNA polymerase alpha isolated from adult-derived cells contained both low-specific-activity and high-specific-activity forms. The low-activity enzyme form, which showed low affinity of binding to DNA template-primer, was activated by treatment with phosphatidylinositol, 32P-ATP, and phosphatidylinositol kinase, resulting in a 32P-labeled enzyme that exhibited high affinity of binding to DNA template-primer. The activated enzyme was unstable, exhibiting a loss of 32P-label correlated with the loss of both specific activity and high affinity of binding to DNA template-primer. The data suggest that DNA polymerase alpha isolated from adult-derived human cells has low-activity and high-activity forms. Decreased specific activity of DNA polymerase alpha correlated with increased age of the donor appears to be a function of loss of an enzyme activator molecule resulting in diminished ability of the enzyme to bind DNA template-primer.\r"

Significantly increased labeling indices were found in the esophageal mucosa of the dysplasia and hyperplasia subjects. There was a gradient of increased expansion in the basal layer of proliferating cells progressing from normal to hyperplasia to dysplasia, with the expansion twice as high in the epithelial cell lining in dysplasia when compared with the findings in the normal and near-normal groups. The correlation of proliferative abnormalities with the severity of precancerous lesions of the esophagus indicates that labeling studies may provide a sensitive adjunct to evaluate risk status and any modifications that might result from nutritional intervention.\r"

Since 1977, the Costa Rican Ministry of Health has maintained a nationwide cancer registry. These circumstances provided an opportunity for a population-based, case-control study of DMPA, OCs, and breast cancer in Costa Rica. Cases were 171 women ages 25-58 years with breast cancer diagnosed between 1982 and 1984; controls were 826 women randomly chosen during a nationwide household survey. Cases and controls were interviewed with the use of a standard questionnaire covering their reproductive and contraceptive histories. Logistic regression methods were used to adjust for confounding factors. While few cases or controls had ever used DMPA, DMPA users had an elevated relative risk (RR) estimate of breast cancer of 2.6 (95% confidence limits = 1.4-4.7) compared with never users. However, no dose-response relationship was found; even the group of women who had used DMPA for less than 1 year had an elevated RR estimate (RR = 2.3; 95% confidence limits = 1.0-5.1). In contrast, OC users had no elevation in RR compared with never users (RR = 1.2; 95% confidence limits = 0.8-1.8). The results of the DMPA analysis are inconclusive. Before decisions are made on whether to continue providing this effective contraceptive method, other ongoing studies will need to confirm of refute these findings.\r"

  ".W": "A cohort study of 2,103 workers employed between 1942 and 1960 at a uranium mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, was conducted. A total of 57 lung cancer deaths was observed (expected = 24.73, P less than .0001). There was a highly significant linear relationship between exposure and increased risk of lung cancer, giving estimates for the relative and attributable risk coefficients of 0.27 per working level month (WLM) and 3.10 per WLM per 10(6) person-years. These risk coefficients were substantially less than those estimated from the experience of miners in the Beaverlodge mine, which have previously been reported. Any biases in the present estimates are likely to have been upward, and therefore they probably represent an upper limit. The major difference between the two mine cohorts is in the exposure rate, since the Port Radium miners were exposed to much greater concentrations of radon daughters than the Beaverlodge miners. It is postulated that risk of lung cancer from radon daughter exposure may be modified by exposure rate, for which hypothesis there is some support from other epidemiologic data.\r"

The Le phenotype was determined in sera with the use of the dot-immunobinding assay and on erythrocytes. The localizations of the Le antigen and CA19-9 were studied in pancreatic tissues from 22 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. The prevalence of Le(a-,b-) on erythrocytes was significantly higher in patients with pancreatic carcinoma than in normal controls. Nineteen of 21 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, whose Le phenotype on erythrocytes was Le(a-,b-), had Le antigen in tissues and sera, and they had a raised serum CA19-9 level. The remaining 2 patients were of the Le(a-,b-) phenotype for both erythrocytes and sera, and their serum CA19-9 levels were below 6 U/ml. Neither Le antigen nor CA19-9 could be localized in tissues of these 2 patients. Two patients with gastric cancer, 6 with colorectal cancer, and 6 with bile duct carcinoma had Le antigen in sera in spite of having Le(a-,b-) on erythrocytes. These results indicate that the Le phenotype on erythrocytes can undergo a change not infrequently in patients with pancreatic carcinoma as well as in patients with other gastrointestinal cancers, but patients with the Le(a-,b-) phenotype in sera cannot synthesize CA19-19.\r"

Individual year-by-year profiles of water source and treatment were developed by linking lifetime residential information with historical water utility data from an ancillary survey. Risk of bladder cancer increased with intake level of beverages made with tap water. The odds ratio (OR) for the highest vs. lowest quintile of tap water consumption was 1.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23, 1.67; chi 2 for trend = 26.3, P less than .001]. The risk gradient with intake was restricted to persons with at least a 40-year exposure to chlorinated surface water and was not found among long-term users of nonchlorinated ground water. The ORs for the highest vs. lowest quintiles of tap water intake were 1.7 and 2.0, respectively, among subjects with 40-59 and greater than or equal to 60 years' exposure. Duration of exposure to chlorinated surface water was associated with bladder cancer risk among women and nonsmokers of both sexes. Among non-smoking respondents with tap water consumption above the population median, the OR increased with exposure duration to a level of 3.1 (CI = 1.3, 7.3; chi 2 for trend = 6.3, P = .01) for greater than or equal to 60 years of residence at places served by chlorinated surface water (vs. non-chlorinated ground water users). These results extend findings of earlier epidemiologic studies and are consistent with environmental chemistry and toxicologic data demonstrating the presence of genotoxic by-products of chlorine disinfection in treated surface waters.\r"

Since most epidemiologic studies to date relate to the long-term use of dry snuff, which has dominated the U.S. smokeless tobacco market in the past, the concentrations of several toxic and carcinogenic agents in the three most popular dry snuff brands have been compared with those in the five most popular moist snuff brands sold in the United States. All eight samples were analyzed for nitrate, alkaloids, polyphenols, volatile carbonyl compounds, lead, cadmium, selenium, and the carcinogenic compounds benzo[a]pyrene (CAS: 50-32-8), polonium-210 (CAS: 13981-52-7), volatile N-nitrosamines (VNAs), N-nitrosodiethanolamine (CAS: 1116-54-7), and the tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs). Most of the snuff brands were rich in nitrate (greater than or equal to 1.5%), total polyphenols (greater than 2%), and in nicotine (greater than or equal to 1.5%), which is the habituating factor in tobacco use. Concentrations of the VNAs were significantly above the permissible limits set for some food products; the concentrations of the TSNAs in both snuff types exceeded the levels of nitrosamines in other consumer products by at least two to three orders of magnitude. The extremely high levels of the TSNAs in snuff have remained unchanged during the last decade and present the major carcinogenic risk factor for the oral use of snuff. Polonium-210 contributes further to the carcinogenic risk associated with snuff. The chemical-analytical data presented in this study do not indicate marked differences in the carcinogenic potential of moist snuff compared to dry snuff.\r"

A total of 51 specimens (38 primary tumors, 13 effusions) were examined from 45 patients with tumors of the ovary, lung, breast, colon, and testicles. Sufficient numbers (greater than or equal to 3) of metaphase cells to be useful for karyotypic analysis were obtained in 42 of 51 (82.3%) specimens. More than 10 analyzable metaphases were found in each of 32 specimens (62.7%), but in some cases it was necessary to examine many slide preparations to achieve this number. The rate of successful chromosome preparations was markedly better for short-term cultures than for specimens harvested directly. Short-term cultures generally showed a mitotic peak after about 3 days of growth in vitro. Generally, the quality of metaphase cells was better in specimens disaggregated enzymatically with collagenase than in those dissociated mechanically. Exposure to ethidium bromide (EB) for the final 2 hours of culture yielded more cells with elongated chromosomes than cultures harvested by conventional methods without EB. Overall, the findings indicate that successful karyotypic analysis can be performed in a high percentage of human solid tumors with the use of techniques that can be readily applied in most cytogenetics laboratories. However, further methodological advances in tissue culture are warranted to routinely provide large numbers of mitotic cells for karyotypic analysis.\r"

  ".W": "To quantify the risk of radiation-induced leukemia and provide further information on the nature of the relationship between dose and response, a case-control study was undertaken in a cohort of over 150,000 women with invasive cancer of the uterine cervix. The cases either were reported to one of 17 population-based cancer registries or were treated in any of 16 oncologic clinics in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Four controls were individually matched to each of 195 cases of leukemia on the basis of age and calendar year when diagnosed with cervical cancer and survival time. Leukemia diagnoses were verified by one hematologist. Radiation dose to active bone marrow was estimated by medical physicists on the basis of the original radiotherapy records of study subjects. The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignancies without evidence for an association with ionizing radiation, was not increased [relative risk (RR) = 1.03; n = 52]. However, for all other forms of leukemia taken together (n = 143), a twofold risk was evident (RR = 2.0; 90% confidence interval = 1.0-4.2). Risk increased with increasing radiation dose until average doses of about 400 rad (4 Gy) were reached and then decreased at higher doses. This pattern is consistent with experimental data for which the down-turn in risk at high doses has been interpreted as due to killing of potentially leukemic cells. The dose-response information was modeled with various RR functions, accounting for the nonhomogeneous distribution of radiation dose during radiotherapy. The local radiation doses to each of 14 bone marrow compartments for each patient were incorporated in the models, and the corresponding risks were summed. A good fit to the observed data was obtained with a linear-exponential function, which included a positive linear induction term and a negative exponential term. The estimate of the excess RR per rad was 0.9%, and the estimated RR at 100 rad (1 Gy) was 1.7. The model proposed in this study of risk proportional to mass exposed and of risk to an individual given by the sum of incremental risks to anatomic sites appears to be applicable to a wide range of dose distributions. Furthermore, the pattern of leukemia incidence associated with different levels of radiation dose is consistent with a model postulating increasing risk with increasing exposure, modified at high doses by increased frequency of cell death, which reduces risk.\r"

Rats were fed diets containing 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, or TDNT at concentrations that resulted in doses of 27 mg/kg/day for 2,4-DNT, 7 or 14 mg/kg/day for 2,6-DNT, and 35 mg/kg/day for TDNT. The carcinogenic effects were evaluated after 1 year of treatment. Administration of 2,6-DNT produced hepatocellular carcinomas in 100 and 85% of animals receiving 14 and 7 mg/kg, respectively. In contrast to the 2,6-DNT results, feeding of 2,4-DNT for 1 year caused no hepatic tumors. Treatment with both isomers (TDNT) resulted in a 47% incidence of hepatocellular tumors. The majority of tumors had a trabecular pattern, and pulmonary metastases were present in the 14- and 7-mg/kg 2,6-DNT-fed groups. These results have demonstrated that 2,6-DNT is a potent and complete hepatocarcinogen and that 2,4-DNT, under these conditions, is nonhepatocarcinogenic. In addition, these data indicate that 2,6-DNT accounts for the majority of the carcinogenic activity of TDNT.\r"

In this study, the radiation damage to microvasculature was investigated in a rabbit model during the early phases of irradiation with the use of vascular permeability as a marker. By means of a triple isotopic technique, the vascular, extravascular, and intracellular spaces could be defined. A forelimb and hindlimb of New Zealand White rabbits were irradiated with single doses of 2-30 Gy. 125I- and 131I-labeled bioscreened albumin were used to determine the changes in vascular permeability due to irradiation. The rabbits were sacrificed at various intervals post irradiation. Vascular and extravascular spaces and the respective albumin concentrations in tissue samples from irradiated limbs were compared with control values from the unirradiated contralateral limbs in each animal. The results indicated a definite increase in the vascular permeability of albumin secondary to irradiation. The increase in vascular permeability was apparent instantaneously with irradiation, even at 2 Gy. The microvascular compromise appear to be dose related. When examined at 16-24 hours post irradiation, the excess extravasation of albumin was significant at and beyond 8 Gy. At 10-30 days post irradiation, injury was not apparent up to 15 Gy. Thus there appeared to be an instantaneous injury at the capillary level due to irradiation, which appeared to be dose related. A repair process became evident as early as 16-24 hours and appeared to be dose related as well as related to elapsed time post irradiation.\r"

After 1-hour activation with visible light, BPD was 10 times more cytotoxic than HP toward human adherent cell lines: A549 lung cancer, Calu-1 lung carcinoma, and CCD-19Lu normal lung, killing 100% of cells at the concentration of 70 ng/ml. Under the same conditions, BPD was 10-70 times more cytotoxic than HP toward nonadherent cells and cell lines. Tested were human leukemia cell lines HL60, K562, and KG1, normal human lymphocytes, and mouse mastocytoma cell line P815. The concentrations required to kill 100% of cells varied between 10 and 500 ng BPD/ml and between 0.2 and 10 micrograms HP/ml. The difference between the nonadherent cell lines in respect to their sensitivity to phototoxicity of both BPD and HP seemed to be related to the cell sizes, with the smallest cells being the most vulnerable. The most attractive characteristic of BPD in addition to its powerful phototoxicity is its maximum absorption around 700 nm, which is in the range of wavelengths penetrating tissues the best. This characteristic alone could make BPD a drug of choice in cancer photodynamic therapy when the safety of its use is ensured. Preliminary tests in vivo have shown that DBA/2J mice can tolerate a single ip injection of 20-60 micrograms BPD as well as the same dose of HP. The biodistribution and toxicity studies of BPD are under way in our laboratory.\r"

  ".W": "Mammary adenocarcinomas induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in female BALB/c mice were investigated as to their morphology and immunohistochemistry and their content of steroid, prolactin (PRL), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. Histologically, these tumors were mainly of ductal origin, since hyperplastic alveolar nodules were observed only in 3 cases. No viral particles were encountered in electron microscopic studies. Estrogen and/or progesterone, PRL, and EGF receptors were detected in MPA-induced tumors, as well as in the occasional spontaneous mammary tumors of multiparous females. EGF was detected, by a radioimmunoassay, in the cystic fluid of 12 mammary adenocarcinomas. MPA treatment was found to induce uterine secretory changes, glandular cystic hyperplasia, and eventually deciduomas that stained strongly for desmin and to a lesser degree for vimentin, suggesting a muscular differentiation. Consequently, MPA-induced adenocarcinomas can be considered as ductal tumors that possess estrogen and/or progesterone, PRL, and EGF receptors. Whether MPA induces tumor growth directly via progesterone receptors remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "An Eco-RI restriction fragment length polymorphism occurring in a DNA fragment containing the first exon of the murine KRAS2 gene was shown to correlate with the inherited susceptibility of inbred strains of mice to urethan (CAS: 51-79-6)-induced pulmonary adenomas. Eco-RI digestion of murine DNA yielded four KRAS2-specific fragments. Polymorphic variation occurred in the smallest molecular-weight fragment with alleles of either 0.70 or 0.55 kb in size. Genotyping of 14 inbred strains of mice revealed a correlation between KRAS2 Eco-RI polymorphic variation and the differential susceptibility among inbred strains to development of pulmonary adenomas. Strains with a high incidence of pulmonary adenomas, either spontaneously occurring or in response to carcinogen induction, had the 0.55-kb KRAS2 allele whereas adenoma-resistant strains had the 0.70-kb allele. Analysis of a series of recombinant inbred strains (AXB, BXA) that developed from reciprocal crosses between a highly susceptible strain (A/J) and a highly resistant strain (C57BL/6J) revealed a statistically significant threefold difference in lung tumor susceptibility on the basis of KRAS2 genotype. Further analysis of individual F2 mice of a C57BL/6 female X A/J male cross also demonstrated a threefold difference in tumor susceptibility on the basis of KRAS2 allelic variation.\r"

Prepubertal tumor-bearing mice, tumor-bearing hypophysectomized Sprague-Dawley rats, and malnourished non-tumor-bearing animals served as additional groups of study and control animals. Adult sarcoma-bearing mice showed an increase in plasma levels of GH early following tumor implantation. GH levels increased further with tumor progression. The anorexia and the state of malnutrition in sarcoma-bearing mice were the major factors behind increased GH levels. Muscle wasting and body composition in the tumor-bearing host were not improved by GH treatment at doses that increased growth rate in normal growing mice with intact pituitaries or partially normalized growth rate in hypophysectomized rats. Exogenous GH supported tumor growth and host body growth to the same extent in hypophysectomized rats. Exogenous GH in excess of endogenous GH did not stimulate tumor growth further. It is suggested that increased GH production in a tumor-bearing host acts in concert with other hormones to stimulate endogenous substrate mobilization and in tumor-bearing animals to prevent substrate deficiency and hypoglycemia. On the basis of this conclusion, it is unlikely that GH supplementation to a freely eating tumor-bearing host will support replenishment of host tissues.\r"

With the use of a subcutaneously growing murine thymoma, it was demonstrated that nonselective and cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents were capable of increasing threefold tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver perfusion of 125I-labeled MAbs. Subsequently, these beta-adrenergic blocking agents were found to increase the antitumor efficacy of idarubicin (Ida)-MAb conjugates. Conjugate-treated mice that also received beta-adrenergic blocking agents had a smaller mean tumor size and a greater number of regressions than mice receiving Ida-MAb conjugate alone. By contrast, prazosin HCl, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent, and Cyclospasmol, a peripheral vasodilator, did not enhance the tumor perfusion and antitumor efficacy of 125I- or Ida-conjugated MAbs, and no vasoactive agent enhanced the antitumor effect of Ida when used alone. By their selective action on normal blood vessels, vasoactive drugs can change the tumor-to-normal tissue perfusion ratio, thereby enhancing the access of drug-MAb conjugates to tumors and increasing the effectiveness of tumor therapy with the use of drug-MAb conjugates.\r"

In disease states, alterations in these glycoproteins, particularly the sialoglycoproteins (SGs), have been reported. The present study defined parallel qualitative and quantitative changes in SGs in three colon regions during 1,2-dimethylhydrazine [(DMH) CAS: 540-73-8]-induced carcinogenesis. SGs were assessed histochemically by use of high iron diamine-Alcian blue (pH 2.5) staining, and tissue sialic acid levels were measured by a modified Warren assay. Two groups of inbred SD rats (n = 28) were pair-fed nutritionally complete liquid diets with 36% of calories supplied as ethanol or isocaloric carbohydrates. The dietary alcohol was added to selectively enhance rectal tumors, a region of prevalent tumors in humans. Both groups received 4 weeks of liquid diet followed by 4 weeks of standard laboratory chow with weekly sc injections of DMH. This 8-week cycle was repeated four times (32 wk). Animals from each group were sacrificed at 8, 16, 24, and 32 weeks, and adjacent tissues from proximal and distal colon and rectum were prepared for histology and biochemical assay. The results showed a progressive increase in sialomucin staining in normal-appearing mucosa in distal colon and rectum in both groups but not in the proximal colon. In contrast, tissue sialic acid increased in all three regions as early as 8 weeks, and significant increases were consistently present by 32 weeks. A different pattern was observed in tissue from frank tumors. Compared with normal-appearing mucosa, both sialomucin staining and tissue sialic acid levels were reduced in tumor tissue by 32 weeks. These studies indicated that tissue sialic acid levels may provide a simple and reliable screening technique in the early diagnosis of premalignant change in all regions of the colon.\r"

Sprague-Dawley rat microvessel fragments, from epididymal fat pads, seeded onto the confluent culture of myofibroblastic cells from the same tissue origin, gave rise to microvascular networks on and in the multilayered myofibroblastic cells. In contrast, the capillary growth from the vessel fragments was markedly inhibited in the presence of 10-1,000 U TNF/ml. Monoclonal antibody against TNF completely neutralized the capillary growth inhibitory activity of TNF. The mode of angiogenesis inhibitory action of TNF was also examined by use of bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells and rat myofibroblastic cells. TNF exerted growth inhibitory and cytotoxic actions against BCE cells cultivated on the various basement membrane components, such as extracellular matrix secreted by BCE cells, fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. An irreversible damage to most of the BCE cells was observed ultrastructurally after 60 hours' exposure to TNF. TNF, however, did not injure the myofibroblastic cells but rather stimulated their growth. These findings indicate that TNF inhibits in vitro capillary growth by its direct cytostatic and cytotoxic actions to microvascular endothelial cells.\r"

  ".U": "88095851\r", 
  ".W": "The organization of salivary gland ducts, especially the presence or absence of myoepithelial cells, is central to histogenetic approaches to the classification of salivary gland tumors. Striated and excretory ducts are reported to be devoid of myoepithelial cells but do contain basal cells. To investigate the nature of such basal cells, tissue sections of normal human salivary glands were examined by means of immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and fluorescent microscopic techniques. With the use of a mouse monoclonal anticytokeratin antibody (3 12C8-1) that, in salivary glands, is specific for myoepithelial cells, these cells associated with acini and intercalated ducts were strongly stained, as were the basal cells of striated and excretory ducts in each case. Ultrastructurally, some basal cells of both striated and excretory ducts had narrow, elongated cellular processes or the main portion of the cell containing parallel arrays of microfilaments with linear densities and micropinocytotic vesicles, whereas in other basal cells tonofilament bundles predominated. A similar range of cytoplasmic features existed in myoepithelial cells associated with acinar and intercalated duct cells. In addition, some duct basal cells have a complement of actin filaments similar to classic myoepithelium of acini and intercalated ducts. Striated and excretory ducts of human salivary glands, therefore, contain fully differentiated and modified myoepithelial cells, both of which express a specific cytokeratin polypeptide that is absent from duct luminal and acinar cells. Differentiation patterns in the intralobular and interlobular ducts suggest that these regions of salivary gland parenchyma cannot be excluded as histogenetic sites for the induction of salivary gland tumors in which neoplastic myoepithelial cells have been shown to have a major role.\r"

We studied 50 consecutive patients, or whom two had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at the time of diagnosis of HL. AIDS developed in another eight patients during the observation period. All patients had HL on the lateral portion of the tongue, most often evident as bilateral white lesions with a corrugated surface. The size, severity, and surface characteristics of the lesions showed wide variation. Clinically flat lesions, most often located on the ventral surface of the tongue, also occurred in one third of the cases. The dominant histologic features were epithelial hyperparakeratosis with hairlike projections, hyperplasia/acanthosis, vacuolated cells resembling koilocytes, and an absence of inflammation in the connective tissue. In addition, candidal hyphae and bacteria were often seen in or on the surface epithelium. Lesions that were flat clinically often lacked \"hairs\" histologically. There was no correlation between clinical size, severity, or surface characteristics and the development of AIDS. Similarly, no histologic parameters identified subgroups of patients as being at a higher risk for the development of AIDS. Thus, even the most subtle white lesion of the tongue may indicate a considerable risk for the later development of AIDS. It can be concluded that HL represents a new lesion, predominantly of the tongue, in patients with HIV infection that shows considerable clinical and histologic variation. Typical HL is easily diagnosed, but atypical HL may be diagnosed mostly on the basis of absence of response to antifungal treatment and histologic exclusion of other lesions.\r"

Endodontic access was achieved, and a No. 10 k-type endodontic file was inserted to a point approximately 1 to 2 mm short of the radiographic apex. By securing the mandible and Rinn instrument with plaster mounts, exposures were made from identical angles and film and jaw placement remained constant in both techniques. Conventional film images were recorded on Kodak Ultraspeed film with six to eight impulses. Xeroradiographic images were recorded with four to five impulses. Radiographs and xeroradiographs were evaluated with the use of light from a masked viewbox. A magnifying glass was used to evaluate visualization of the following entities: the root apex; the periodontal ligament; the trabecular pattern; and the measuring instruments. The images were examined and categorized by three examiners, who used the following scores: 3, optimal for diagnostic information; 2, adequate for diagnostic information; 1, poor but providing diagnostic information; and 0, unacceptably poor. In all categories examined, the information provided by xeroradiographs was significantly greater than that provided by conventional radiographs (p less than .05). In terms of diagnostic value and lower patient dose, xeroradiographs are preferred to conventional radiographs.\r"

Computed tomography scans of the temporomandibular joint were made in the axial plane with the teeth in centric occlusion, and measurements were made from vertically reformatted images. Interarticular joint spaces were measured anterosuperiorly, superiorly, posterosuperiorly, and posteriorly from the condylar surfaces. This was repeated in five equidistant (3.1 mm) serial sagittal planes across the condyle, beginning and ending, on average, 2.5 mm from the lateral and medial condylar poles. Articular disk positions (anterolateral, anterior, anteromedial, medial, and normal) were correlated with condylar position. Significant differences between disk positions and joint spaces were found most frequently in the anterosuperior and the superior joint interval. When the disk was positioned normally, the anterosuperior joint space was consistent (1.5 to 2.0 mm) across the joint (standard deviation, 0.3 to 0.8 mm). The superior, the posterosuperior, and the posterior joint spaces in the normal joint were greater than the anterosuperior joint space. When the disk was anterior to the condyle, the anterosuperior joint interval was widened. When the disk was medial, the superior joint space was significantly wider than normal across the breadth of the condyle. In those joints in which the disk was anteromedial, there was an absence (0.2 mm) of joint space, and this occurred in all areas of the condyle except in its medial one fourth. In the internally deranged joint, joint space narrowing may be focal in nature.\r"

To determine the properties of the receptor that are relevant for channel opening and signal transmission, we have developed a cell-flow technique that allows measurements to be made with cells prior to receptor desensitization. Here we illustrate the usefulness of the technique. A wide concentration range of both a ligand that controls the opening of receptor channels (carbamoylcholine) and a receptor inhibitor (procaine) was used to measure the dissociation constant of the receptor site controlling channel opening (2.4 X 10(-4) M), the channel-opening equilibrium constant (5.5), the inhibition constant for procaine (5.8 X 10(-5) M), and the rate coefficients for two desensitization processes of 5 s-1 and 0.2 s-1. The cell-flow technique illustrated here is of interest because, by rapid-reaction techniques, it extends the chemical kinetic approach from investigations of reactions in solutions to investigations of many different receptors that exist in membranes of central nervous system cells and whose properties are not well known.\r"

  ".W": "Yeast transcription factor tau (transcription factor IIIC) specifically interacts with tRNA genes, binding to both the A block and the B block elements of the internal promoter. To study the influence of A block-B block spacing, we analyzed the binding of purified tau protein to a series of internally deleted yeast tRNA(3Leu) genes with A and B blocks separated by 0 to 74 base pairs. Optimal binding occurred with genes having A block-B block distances of 30-60 base pairs; the relative helical orientation of the A and B blocks was unimportant. Results from DNase I \"footprinting\" and lambda exonuclease protection experiments were consistent with these findings and further revealed that changes in A block-B block distance primarily affect the ability of tau to interact with A block sequences; B block interactions are unaltered. When the A block-B block distance is 17 base pairs or less, tau interacts with a sequence located 15 base pairs upstream of the normal A block, and a new RNA initiation site is observed by in vitro transcription. We propose that the initial binding of tau to the B block activates transcription by enhancing its ability to bind at the A block, and that the A block interaction ultimately directs initiation by RNA polymerase III.\r"

In the model, the catalytic center has a two-helix structural framework composed of the base-paired segments of the group I conserved sequence elements. The structural framework supports and orients the conserved nucleotides that are adjacent to the base-paired sequence elements; these conserved nucleotides are proposed to form the active site and to bind the 5' splice-site duplex and the guanine nucleotide substrate.

We now report the complementation of the UV sensitivity of this cell line by gene transfer. A human cDNA clone library constructed in a mammalian expression vector, and itself incorporated in a lambda phage vector, was introduced into the cells as a calcium phosphate precipitate. Following selection to G418 resistance, provided by the neo gene of the vector, transformants were selected for UV resistance. Twenty-one cell clones were obtained with UV-resistance levels typical of normal human fibroblasts. All transformants contained vector DNA sequences in their nuclei. Upon further propagation in the absence of selection for G418 resistance, about half of the primary transformants remained UV-resistant. Secondary transformants were generated by transfection with a partial digest of total chromosomal DNA from one of these stable transformants. This resulted in 15 G418-resistant clones, 2 of which exhibited a UV-resistant phenotype. The other primary clones lost UV resistance rapidly when subcultured in the absence of G418. Importantly, several retained UV resistance under G418 selection pressure. The acquisition of UV resistance by secondary transformants derived by transfection of DNA from a stable primary transformant, and the linkage between G418 and UV resistances in the unstable primary transformants, strongly suggests that the transformants acquired UV resistance through DNA-mediated gene transfer and not by reversion.\r"

The terminal domain at the distal end of the clathrin leg is at the amino terminus of the heavy chain. It is connected to the distal segment by a flexible \"link\" from Tyr-479 to Arg-523. There is an unusual sequence at the carboxyl terminus that may form the globular projection at the vertex of the clathrin trimer.

This report demonstrates that mRNA of the metallothionein (MT) gene was induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in cultured epidermal keratinocytes and also in liver, kidney, and skin tissues when 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, a synthetic precursor of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, was applied in vivo. Exposure of FRSK cells, a cell line derived from fetal rat skin keratinocytes, to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 at 5 ng/ml (12 nM) increased MT mRNA to almost the same extent as that induced by 10 microM dexamethasone or 1 microM CdCl2. This increase in the level of MT mRNA was evident within 2 hr and was maximal 12-24 hr after the addition of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The induction was dose-dependent with concentrations of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 from 0.05 to 5.0 ng/ml. Amounts of MT increased with the increase of MT mRNA induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. Of the derivatives of vitamin D3 tested, only 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 caused marked induction. Treatment with cycloheximide did not inhibit MT mRNA induction by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 induced MT mRNA in primary cultures of mouse epidermal keratinocytes but not in IAR-20, a liver cell line. 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 had a similar effect in vivo: oral administration of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 to mice resulted in increased levels of MT mRNA in the liver, kidney, and skin 24 hr later. Increase in the level of MT mRNA may be relevant to some biological actions of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3.\r"

A mutation in araI and a known mutation in araC led to the loss of araI2 binding, while binding to araI1 was unaffected. Both mutants failed to activate the promoter of the araBAD operon. We propose that araI2 occupancy by AraC protein leads to RNA polymerase recognition of the araBAD promoter and that araI1 acts as a switch mechanism allowing both the repressor and the activator forms of AraC protein to regulate the araBAD promoter.\r"

To identify regions of the hTNF protein involved in binding hTNF to its receptor, we prepared five synthetic peptides [hTNF-(1-15), hTNF-(1-31), hTNF-(65-79), hTNF-(98-111), and hTNF-(124-141)] and two hydroxylamine cleavage fragments [hTNF-(1-39) and hTNF-(40-157)] of hTNF. The hTNF-synthetic peptides and hTNF fragments were tested in hTNF receptor binding assays and in two biologic assays: cytolysis of tumor cells and suppression of lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes. Neither the synthetic peptides nor hTNF fragments were active agonists or antagonists in these assays. The synthetic peptides were also conjugated to thyroglobulin, and peptide-specific antisera were raised. All five peptide-thyroglobulin conjugates induced antibody responses to the immunizing peptide and to hTNF. Each antiserum was tested for antagonist activity in hTNF binding assays. Only antisera raised against hTNF-(1-15) or hTNF-(1-31) and antisera against whole hTNF blocked binding. IgGs purified from these three antisera also block hTNF-induced cytolysis and lipoprotein lipase suppression. We conclude that antibodies that recognize the N-terminus of hTNF block the attachment of hTNF to its cellular receptor and inhibit the biologic effects of hTNF.\r"

We have studied the mode of substrate and analogue binding at equilibrium to the paramagnetic [4Fe-4S]+ cluster of the reduced active form by 17O and 13C electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy with specifically labeled substrates. The data show that with substrate, only the carboxyl at C-2 of the propane backbone is strongly bound in addition to H2O or OH- (HxO) from the solvent, whereas in an isocitrate analogue that has a nitro group at C-2, the carboxyl and hydroxyl at C-1 are bound along with solvent HxO. We conclude from these data that, on addition of any one of the three substrates, cis-aconitate is the predominant species bound to Fea of the cluster along with solvent HxO and that cis-aconitate is bound in the citrate mode (carboxyl at C-2). The results with the nitro analogue show that the enzyme can also bind a substrate-like ligand to the cluster in the alternative isocitrate mode (carboxyl at C-1), as is implicit in models proposed for the aconitase reaction.\r"

Furthermore, this fragment was active when placed either upstream or downstream of the CAT gene and when present in either orientation. The activity of this enhancer was examined in relation to differentiation by using \"micromass\" culture of limb bud mesenchyme cells undergoing chondrogenesis. In this system, no response to the enhancer was observed in undifferentiated limb bud mesenchyme cells. Following differentiation into chondrocytes, a 13-fold enhancer effect was observed in these cells. Finally, all-trans-retinoic acid, a known teratogen, dramatically suppressed enhancer activity in chondrocytes and differentiating limb bud mesenchyme cells. These results suggest that the collagen II gene contains an enhancer element in the first intron that is involved in cell-specific expression.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence have suggested that the regulation of type I collagen gene transcription is complex and that important regulatory elements reside 5' to, and within, the first intron of the alpha 1(I) gene. We therefore sequenced a 2.3-kilobase HindIII fragment that encompasses 804 base pairs of 5' flanking sequence, the first exon, and most of the first intron of the alpha 1(I) human collagen gene. A 274-base-pair intronic sequence, flanked by Ava I sites (A274), contained a sequence identical to a high-affinity decanucleotide binding site for transcription factor Sp1 and a viral core enhancer sequence. DNase I protection experiments indicated zones of protection that corresponded to these motifs. When A274 was cloned 5' to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, driven by an alpha 1(I) collagen promoter sequence, and expression was assessed by transfection, significant orientation-specific inhibition of CAT activity was observed. This effect was most apparent in chicken tendon fibroblasts, which modulate their level of collagen synthesis in culture. We propose that normal regulation of alpha 1(I) collagen gene transcription results from an interplay of positive and negative elements present in the promoter region and within the first intron.\r"

The COS-1 cell rhodopsin activates the GTPase activity of bovine transducin in a light-dependent manner with the same specific activity as that of purified bovine rhodopsin. Electron microscopy of immunogold-stained cells indicates that rhodopsin is located in the plasma membrane of the transfected cells and is oriented with the amino terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane. This orientation is analogous to that of rhodopsin in the disk membranes of photoreceptor cells in the bovine retina.\r"

A genomic library of P. testosteroni total DNA constructed from partial EcoRI digests ligated to a lambda gtWES vector was probed with a 23-base oligonucleotide mixture [ATGAAC(T)ACC(A,T)CCG(C,A)GAG(A)CAC(T)ATGAC] corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of steroid isomerase. Subclones derived from a recombinant phage containing a 5400-base-pair insert were sequenced and found to contain the expected 375-nucleotide open reading frame flanked at both ends by in-frame TGA termination codons. The DNA sequence agreed with the above 125-amino acid sequence except for codons 22, 24, 33, and 38, all of which encoded Asp rather than Asn, and codon 77, which encoded Glu rather than Gln. A 1370-base-pair fragment was inserted into pUC 19 plasmid vector and used to construct a strain of Escherichia coli JM 101 that overexpressed the isomerase gene in the presence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cytosolic extracts of this strain contained a major soluble protein that migrated with the steroid delta-isomerase subunit on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These cytosolic extracts had 10-50% of the specific activity of crystalline isomerase, depending on the method of preparation. The recombinant enzyme was crystallized in both monoclinic (flat plates) and hexagonal (bipyramids) crystal forms, described previously for the enzyme isolated from P. testosteroni. The kinetic properties of the crystalline recombinant enzyme, including specific activity, Km for 5-androstene-3,17-dione (340 microM), and Ki for the competitive inhibitor 19-nortestosterone (11.9 microM), agreed closely with the values reported for the isolated enzyme.\r"

The yellow emission has been postulated previously to result from energy transfer from an electronically excited species formed in the bacterial luciferase-catalyzed reaction to a secondary emitter protein, termed the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). We report here the purification of YFP to homogeneity without loss of the chromophore. The protein was found to be a homodimer of Mr 22,000 subunits with one weakly bound FMN per subunit. The FMN-protein complex was stabilized by 10% (vol/vol) glycerol in the buffers, allowing purification of the active holo-YFP. The protein migrated as a single spot with an isoelectric point of approximately 6.5 on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gave an N-terminal sequence of Met-Phe-Lys-Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gly-Ile-Gly-Ile-Ile-Glu-Lys-Ile. Addition of purified YFP to a reaction in which luciferase was supplied with FMNH2 (reduced FMN) by a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase resulted in a dramatic enhancement in the intensity of bioluminescence and an additional peak in the emission spectrum at about 534 nm. The resulting bimodal bioluminescence emission spectrum had peaks at 484 nm, apparently due to emission from the luciferase-flavin complex, and at 534 nm, corresponding to the fluorescence emission maximum of YFP. This bimodal spectrum closely matched the emission spectrum in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We present a comparative study of calorimetrically derived thermodynamic profiles for the binding of a series of drugs with selected DNA host duplexes. We use these data to demonstrate that comparisons between complete thermodynamic profiles (delta G zero, delta H zero, delta S zero, delta Cp) are required before drug binding can be used as a probe of DNA conformation, since enthalpy-entropy compensations can cause two drug-DNA binding events to exhibit similar binding free energies (delta G zero) despite being driven by entirely different thermodynamic forces (delta H zero, delta S zero). In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to characterize thermodynamically the DNA binding of netropsin and distamycin (two minor groove-directed ligands), ethidium (an intercalator), and daunomycin (a combined intercalator/groove binder). Our free energy data (delta G zero) show that each drug exhibits similar binding affinities at 25 degrees C for the alternating copolymer duplex poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)] and for the homopolymer duplex poly(dA).poly(dT). However, our calorimetric measurements reveal that the nature of the thermodynamic forces (delta H zero, delta S zero) that drive drug binding to these two host duplexes at 25 degrees C are entirely different, despite similar binding free energies (delta G zero) and similar salt dependencies (lnK/ln[Na+]). Specifically, the 25 degrees C binding of all four drugs to the alternating copolymer poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)] is overwhelmingly enthalpy driven, whereas the corresponding binding of each drug to the homopolymer duplex poly(dA).poly(dT) is overwhelmingly entropy driven. Thus, the similar binding free energies (delta G zero) we measure for complexation of each drug with poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)] and poly(dA).poly(dT) result from compensating changes in the enthalpy and entropy terms. Comparison with the thermodynamic profiles for the complexation of these drug molecules to other DNA host duplexes at 25 degrees C reveals that the binding of each is strongly enthalpy driven, except when the poly(dA).poly(dT) homopolymer serves as the host duplex. This comparison allows us to conclude that poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)] behaves thermodynamically as the more \"normal\" host duplex toward drug binding, whereas the entropy-driven binding to the poly(dA).poly(dT) duplex represents \"aberrant\" behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In crude extracts of epidermal papillomas induced by an initiation-promotion protocol, ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase) activity was increased by the addition of GTP to the enzyme assay. No effect of GTP on the phorbol ester-induced enzyme isolated from normal epidermis was observed. Kinetic analyses indicated that the major effect of the nucleotide on the tumor-derived enzyme was to lower the apparent Km for L-ornithine. When papilloma OrnDCase was partially purified by gel-filtration chromatography, two forms of the enzyme were resolved, only one of which was found in an epidermal extract from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated mice. The enzymatic properties of the two forms of papilloma enzyme were compared. The higher molecular weight form (peak I) was activated by GTP, while the lower molecular weight form (peak II) was not. As expected from the kinetic analyses of the crude papilloma extracts, the apparent Km of peak I enzyme for L-ornithine was very high (1.25 mM) but was much lower in the presence of GTP (0.02 mM). The two forms of papilloma OrnDCase differed in their sensitivities to heat inactivation and the ability of GTP to protect against heat inactivation. The K1/2 for activation of peak I OrnDCase by GTP was 0.1 microM. The activation process was irreversible and did not require Mg2+. When several nucleotides were tested for their ability to activate peak I OrnDCase, only GTP, dGTP, and the nonhydrolyzable derivative GTP[gamma-S] were effective, while GDP, GMP, ATP, and CTP were relatively ineffective. Our results demonstrated the existence of two forms of OrnDCase in epidermal tumor extracts, of which one can be activated by GTP and one cannot. The significance of these findings for the regulation of this enzyme in normal and tumor cells is discussed.\r"

It has been purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic chromatography and consists of a polydisperse family of molecules with Mr 5000-40,000. It contains galactose, mannose, glucose, arabinose, glucosamine, and inositol in the molar ratio of 51:21:5:6:1:1. The lipophosphoglycan has a complex structure, consisting mainly of tri- and tetrasaccharide units linked by phosphodiester bonds, which are cleaved by HF hydrolysis. The phosphate groups are located on the 6-hydroxyl of both galactose and mannose residues. The lipophosphoglycan is anchored to the parasite surface by a 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol moiety. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the products of nitrous acid deamination, HF hydrolysis, and Staphylococcus aureus phosphatidylinositol specific-phospholipase C treatment. The 24:0 and 26:0 alkyl chains accounted for 93% of the ether-linked fatty acids in the lipid anchor. The results are also consistent with a glycosidic linkage between the inositol and a non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue. The lipophosphoglycan membrane anchor shares limited structural homology with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of several eukaryotic proteins, indicating that this type of membrane anchor is not limited to proteins. Vaccination of mice with the purified L. major lipophosphoglycan in liposomes induced resistance against cutaneous leishmaniasis.\r"

A solution hybridization/RNase protection assay was used to simultaneously quantitate the relative abundance of IGF-I transcripts with the different 5' untranslated regions. In all the tissues studied, transcripts with the class C 5' untranslated region were most abundant. In contrast, both class A and B transcripts were tissue specific. Class A transcripts were present in moderate abundance in liver; in low abundance in kidney, lung, testes, and stomach; and were undetectable in muscle, heart, and brain; whereas class B transcripts were detected only in liver. These three classes of 5' untranslated region were also regulated independently by growth hormone. In liver, heart, kidney, and lung, growth hormone increased the abundance of class C transcripts 2- to 3-fold. In liver, growth hormone increased the abundance of the class A and B transcripts 6- to 7-fold. In lung and kidney, on the other hand, the abundance of class A transcripts was not affected by growth hormone. Thus, rat IGF-I gene transcripts contain one of three alternative 5' untranslated regions, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are differentially regulated by growth hormone. Finally, cDNA probes unique to two of the three 5' untranslated regions hybridized to all three major species of IGF-I mRNA typically seen on RNA blots with a coding region probe.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative probing of heterogeneous regions in muscle is feasible with phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy because of the differentiation of metabolic patterns of glycolytic and oxidative fibers. A differential recruitment of oxidative and glycolytic fibers during exercise was demonstrated in 4 of 10 untrained young men by following changes in phosphate metabolites. Concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphocreatine, and ATP were estimated in the wrist flexor muscles of the forearm at rest, during two cycles of three grades of exercise, and in recovery. At high work levels (40% of maximum strength), two distinct Pi peaks were observed and identified with Pi pools at pH 6.9 and pH 5.9-6.4, respectively. These could be accounted for as follows. At the lowest level of work (using 20% of maximum strength), early recruitment primarily of oxidative (type I) and possibly some intermediate (type IIA) muscle fibers occurs with relatively little net lactate production and consequently little decrease in pH. At higher work loads, however, primarily glycolytic (type IIB) muscle fibers are recruited, which have relatively high net lactate production and therefore generate a second pool of Pi at low pH. ATP depletion (35-54%) and Pi losses accompanied the reduction in ability to perform during the first exercise cycle. When the cycle of graded exercise was repeated immediately, the total Pi remained high but gave rise to only one peak at pH 6.8-7.0. These observations indicated exhaustion of glycolytic type IIB fibers, removal of lactate by high local blood flow, and sustained contractions largely by oxidative type I and IIA fibers. A functional differentiation of fiber types could also be demonstrated during recovery if exercise was stopped while two pools of Pi were still apparent. In the first 3 min of recovery, the Pi peak at pH 6.8-6.9 disappeared almost entirely, whereas the Pi peak at pH 6.0 remained unaltered, reflecting the faster recovery of oxidative type I fibers. The potential of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize oxidative and glycolytic fibers, predict capacity for aerobic performance, and signal the presence of muscle pathology is discussed.\r"

To carry out its function, T antigen binds to duplex DNA at the origin of replication (oriSV40) and exerts a helicase activity that unwinds the two DNA strands. Previous work has defined two binding sites for T antigen near oriSV40, designated sites I and II; site II is within the 64-base-pair core sequence absolutely required for viral DNA replication. We have used electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis to characterize the interaction of T antigen with the origin region. We have found that effective binding to site II under conditions that support DNA replication requires ATP or a nonhydrolyzable analog. In the absence of ATP, T antigen binds mainly to site I; in the presence of ATP, both sites I and II are occupied, and binding is markedly increased. The ATP-dependent reaction generates a complex multimeric structure for T antigen. We conclude that T antigen forms an ATP-dependent nucleoprotein structure at oriSV40. We suggest that this nucleoprotein complex provides for the precise initiation of SV40 DNA replication.\r"

The heat-shock response does not display organ specificity and is not affected by light. Insertion of these HSE-like elements into the pea rbcS-3A 5' flanking fragment (position -410 to +15) either at position -410 (5' to the enhancer) or at position -49 (between the enhancer and the \"TATA\" box) renders the transcript level of the reporter gene light-inducible and organ-specific under heat-shock conditions. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating a unique pattern of expression (e.g., light-dependent and organ-specific heat-shock response) by artificial combination of appropriate cis-acting regulatory elements. Moreover, by using the HSE-like sequences as a weak heat-inducible enhancer in the chimeric regulatory regions we uncover the function of negative elements within the pea rbcS-3A upstream region. These negative elements are responsible for a repressed transcript level in roots as well as in dark-adapted leaves. Therefore, the upstream fragment containing two HSE-like elements can be considered a useful tool to test the function of other cis-acting elements.\r"

Although there is some variability, the average pitch of 1930 +/- 280 (SD) nm is independent of radius. The distribution of observed radii of fibers assembled in vitro is highly skewed, suggesting that individual fibers grow to a maximum radius of about 50 nm, except when both pH and ionic strength are high; fibers aggregate to form thicker fiber bundles under some conditions. The observed twisting may be responsible for limiting the lateral growth of individual fibers. Protofibrils near the surface of a twisted fiber are stretched relative to those near the center. Consequently, the degree to which a protofibril can be stretched limits the radius of a fiber; protofibrils can be added to a growing fiber until the energy required to stretch an added protofibril exceeds the energy of binding. These properties of assembly arise directly from the intrinsic twist of the fibrinogen molecule determined from structural evidence. Simple geometric considerations lead to conclusions regarding the locations of the binding sites for assembly of the protofibril and the flexibility of the fibrin molecule.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors for lysosomal enzymes was investigated in Golgi subfractions prepared from three different cultured cell lines. Total microsomal fractions from clone 9 hepatocytes, normal rat kidney, or Chinese hamster ovary cells were subfractionated by flotation in sucrose density gradients, which resolves Golgi membranes into heavy (cis), intermediate, and light (trans) subfractions. The distribution of Man-6-P receptors within the subfractions was assessed by quantitative immunoprecipitation, and the results were compared to those obtained by immunoperoxidase localization of the receptors in Golgi cisternae of intact cells. In all cases, the results obtained by Golgi subfractionation and by immunoelectron microscopy were in agreement. In clone 9 cells, Man-6-P receptors were enriched in heavy (cis) Golgi subfractions, whose peak density (rho = 1.17) was greater than those containing either galactosyltransferase activity, a trans Golgi marker, or alpha-mannosidase II, a middle Golgi marker. By immunoelectron microscopy, the receptors were localized to a single cis Golgi cisterna. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, Man-6-P receptors were concentrated in Golgi membranes of low density (1.12 g/ml) overlapping the peak of galactosyltransferase activity. By the immunoperoxidase technique, the receptors were usually localized to a single trans Golgi cisterna. In normal rat kidney cells, Man-6-P receptors were found to be broadly distributed across Golgi membranes (rho = 1.12-1.17), and by immunoperoxidase localization they were found to be broadly distributed across the stacked Golgi cisternae. It is concluded that the distribution of Man-6-P receptors within the Golgi complex varies from one cell type to another. These differences in receptor distribution may reflect variations in lysosomal enzyme trafficking among different cell types.\r"

Four complexes involving sequence-nonspecific, single-stranded-DNA-binding proteins were recognized. One inducible complex is determined by the virE locus, two Ti-plasmid-dependent complexes are constitutively expressed, and a fourth one is controlled by chromosomal genes. The protein-DNA complexes were characterized by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and by determination of the length of single-stranded DNA required for their formation. It is hypothesized that the single-stranded-DNA-binding proteins are involved in the production of T-DNA intermediates or have a carrier or protective function during T-DNA transfer.\r"

  ".W": "The number of beta-glucuronidase (GUS; beta-D-glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) molecules per cell varies as much as 12-fold among mouse tissues. To identify the regulatory mechanisms responsible, estimates of the rates of GUS protein synthesis (ks) and degradation (kd) were obtained for six tissues in the B6.PAC-Gusn mouse strain, which carries the N haplotype of the GUS gene. Differences in enzyme levels among tissues were predominantly due to differences in rates of enzyme synthesis; only brain differed significantly in the rate of protein degradation. Typically, tissues contain about 2 molecules of GUS mRNA per cell. Differences in GUS mRNA levels were found among tissues, but these were not sufficient to account for observed differences in ks. This suggests that tissues differ in translational yield, which is defined as the product of the efficiency with which the GUS message is translated and the fraction of newly made polypeptides that are successfully matured into GUS tetramers. Experimental estimates of translational yield confirmed that this is indeed a source of tissue differences in GUS gene regulation. This finding also proved to be true of the B haplotype of the GUS gene. The differential regulation of special-function genes is, in general, effected transcriptionally. In contrast, the differential regulation of several \"housekeeping\" genes has been reported to arise from changes in mRNA maturation and/or stability. It is now apparent that translational yield, which is an aspect of protein synthesis, can also serve as a differential regulatory mechanism.\r"

Time-lapse videomicroscopy of Syrian hamster fibroblast (BHK) cells revealed that caffeine could induce multiple entries into mitosis while cells were blocked in DNA synthesis. As with normal mitoses, the abundance of mitosis-specific phosphoproteins was coupled with the condensation of chromatin. The BHK temperature-sensitive mutant tsBN2 also completed multiple entries into mitosis while arrested during DNA replication and raised to the restrictive temperature. Periodic mitotic events occurred even when BHK cells were exposed to low concentrations of serum or cycloheximide, conditions that prevent the cycling of BHK cells by blocking their entry into S phase. These results suggest that an oscillation governing the activation and inactivation of mitotic factors can be generated in mammalian cells and uncoupled from the G1 and DNA replication events of the normal cell cycle. This system will be useful for examining the molecular nature of mitotic factors.\r"

The slower rate in mtDNA than in cpDNA is probably due to a lower mutation rate. Silent substitution rates in plant and mammalian mtDNAs differ by one or two orders of magnitude, whereas the rates in nDNAs may be similar. In cpDNA, the rate of substitution both at synonymous sites and in noncoding sequences in the inverted repeat is greatly reduced in comparison to single-copy sequences. The rate of cpDNA evolution appears to have slowed in some dicot lineages following the monocot/dicot split, and the slowdown is more conspicuous at nonsynonymous sites than at synonymous sites.\r"

We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus. We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma. These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role.\r"

  ".W": "All cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) share a noncatalytic domain, termed SH2, which comprises approximately 100 residues located immediately N-terminal to the kinase domain. A linker in the AX9m mutant of Fujinami avian sarcoma virus (FSV) introduces a dipeptide insertion into the SH2 domain of the P130gag-fps PTK, which abolishes its ability to transform Rat-2 cells. However, at 36 degrees C AX9m FSV elicits focus formation and agar colony formation in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with single hit kinetics. At 41.5 degrees C AX9m FSV is nontransforming for CEF, and the mutant is therefore both host and temperature dependent for transforming activity. Both in vitro and in vivo, the specific kinase activity of AX9m FSV P130gag-fps, measured by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrates, correlated with transforming activity. The consequences of the AX9m mutation for enzymatic function and transforming activity therefore depend on the cellular environment in which the altered v-fps protein is expressed. We conclude that the SH2 domain directs the interaction of the P130gag-fps catalytic domain with cellular proteins such as substrates for phosphorylation or regulators of kinase activity important for its transforming ability.\r"

The predicted secondary structure of bean U1 snRNA is identical to that of other U1 snRNAs, and the sequences of the single-stranded regions have been highly conserved. Thus, both the sequence of the single-stranded regions and the secondary structure of U1 snRNA appear to be important for its function. The role of U1 snRNA in pre-mRNA splicing is probably similar in plants and animals.\r"

Among the mutants recovered, 26 were single base substitutions including 17 G.C----A.T transitions and a single A.T----G.C transition. Three of the 4 possible transversions accounted for the remaining 8 mutations. The G.C----T.A transversion was not recovered. Six tandem double or closely neighboring double-base substitutions, one double mutation consisting of a G.C----T.A transversion and an adjacent frameshift, as well as one single frameshift mutation were also recovered. UV-induced mutation appears to be targeted to dipyrimidine sites with only two exceptions. These include two double mutations where only one of the base substitutions occurred at a dipyrimidine site. The observed specificity of UV-light-induced mutations at the APRT locus is consistent with the argument that G.C----A.T transitions result primarily from the (6-4) pyrimidine pyrimidone lesion. A striking resemblance in the distribution of UV-induced mutants and a collection of 30 spontaneous mutants identified recently in our laboratory was noted. Both share a common strong site of multiple occurrence and a considerable degree of overlap with respect to site specificity. We speculate therefore that DNA context plays a significant role in mutation fixation in mammalian cells.\r"

By using the Cre-lox site-specific recombination system of coliphage P1, DNA can be readily inserted in vitro into a pseudorabies virus (PRV) vector containing the lox recombination site. The vector PRV42 contains a lox site within the nonessential gIII gene, which encodes a virion envelope glycoprotein. Incubation in vitro of PRV42 DNA with Cre protein and a circular plasmid containing a lox site generates approximately 5% recombinant molecules having the plasmid integrated into the PRV genome at the lox site. Transfection of the reaction mixture into cultured cells allows recovery of the infectious recombinant virus, which is readily identified by a nondestructive \"black-plaque assay\" using a gIII-specific monoclonal antibody. PRV42 plaques stain black when treated with the gIII monoclonal antibody and a peroxidase-linked second anti-antibody because the lox site placed within the gIII gene of PRV42 does not destroy the gIII epitope. However, Cre-mediated integration of heterologous DNA at the lox site disrupts the gIII epitope so that the resulting recombinant virus produces white plaques. The recombinant virus is infectious, stable, and grows as well as the parental PRV42 vector. The inserted plasmid can be efficiently excised (greater than 50%) from viral DNA by Cre and recovered by transformation of Escherichia coli.\r"

To further elucidate the relationship between antigen-chain length and antigenicity, tritiated oligosaccharides derived from type III capsular polysaccharide were used to generate detailed saturation binding curves with a fixed concentration of rabbit antiserum in a radioactive antigen-binding assay. A graded increase in affinity of antigen-antibody binding was seen as oligosaccharide size increased from 2.6 repeating units to 92 repeating units. These differences in affinity of antibody binding to oligosaccharides of different molecular size were confirmed by immunoprecipitation and competitive ELISA, two independent assays of antigen-antibody binding. Analysis of the saturation binding experiment indicated a difference of 300-fold in antibody-binding affinity for the largest versus the smallest tested oligosaccharides. Unexpectedly, the saturation binding values approached by the individual curves were inversely related to oligosaccharide chain length on a molar basis but equivalent on a weight basis. This observation is compatible with a model in which binding of an immunoglobulin molecule to an antigenic site on the polysaccharide facilitates subsequent binding of antibody to that antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports that peptides can frequently mimic epitopes on globular proteins are inconsistent with early studies demonstrating that antibodies to native globular proteins generally do not bind peptides. This discrepancy could result from current confusion of two different populations of antibodies in antisera: one reacting with peptides and denatured protein and the other reacting only with the native protein. To test this possibility, several hundred monoclonal antibodies to rat cytochrome c were examined by ELISA for binding the intact protein and cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides. Inhibition by soluble native cytochrome c identified which antibodies were specific for the native protein. The vast majority of these antibodies did not bind the peptides, whereas most of the antibodies specific for denatured forms did bind them. The results are consistent with the idea that antibodies to denatured antigen are readily detected in solid-phase assays, where some antigen molecules denature as they attach to microtiter plates, and show that these antibodies are generally the ones that react with peptides. Thus, reevaluation of data suggesting that anti-native globular protein antibodies bind peptides is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Complementary DNA clones for complement receptor type 2 (CR2), the B-lymphocyte membrane protein that serves as the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus and the C3d complement fragment, were obtained by screening a lambda gt11 library generated from Raji B lymphoblastoid cell mRNA. A 4.2-kilobase (kb) clone, representing the entire coding sequence of the protein plus untranslated 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences was obtained and sequenced. The 4.2-kb clone, which contains all but about 500 base pairs (bp) of the 5' untranslated region of the full-length CR2 mRNA, consists of 63 bp of 5' untranslated nucleotide sequence followed successively by a start codon, a 20-amino acid hydrophobic signal peptide, 1005 amino acids having a repeating motif, a 28-amino acid probable transmembrane domain, and a 34-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein indicates that the extracellular domain consists entirely of 16 tandemly arranged repeating elements, each 60-75 amino acids in length, which are identified by multiple conserved residues. This repeating motif also occurs in the C3b/C4b receptor, several complement proteins, and a number of noncomplement proteins. In CR2, the 16 repeats occur in four clusters of four repeats each. Approximately 10% of the deduced amino acid sequence, including the amino and carboxyl termini, was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from purified CR2. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of CR2 and related studies are presented here.\r"

We have used DNA-mediated gene transfer and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain cell lines that contain the gene encoding the large subunit of the human 4F2 antigen in a mouse L-cell background. Human DNAs cloned from these cell lines were subsequently used as hybridization probes to isolate a full-length cDNA clone expressing 4F2. Sequence analysis of the coding region has revealed an amino acid sequence of 529 residues. Hydrophobicity plotting has predicted a probable structure for the protein that includes an external carboxyl terminus, an internal leader sequence, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and two possible membrane-associated domains. The 4F2 cDNA detects a single 1.8-kilobase mRNA in T-cell and B-cell lines. RNA gel blot analysis of RNA derived from quiescent and serum-stimulated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts reveals a cell-cycle modulation of 4F2 gene expression: the mRNA is present in quiescent fibroblasts but increases 8-fold 24-36 hr after stimulation, at the time of maximal DNA synthesis.\r"

This inhibition appears to result from competition for binding to the same receptor. Radioiodinated TBI-22, like angiotensin II, bound to the solubilized receptor with an affinity such that the binding was inhibited 50% by unlabeled TBI-22 or angiotensin II at nanomolar concentrations. The binding reaction, like that for angiotensin II, required p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and was reversed in the presence of dithiothreitol. TBI-22 and angiotensin II share the sequence Val-Tyr-Ile-His; this tetrapeptide alone, however, did not inhibit binding of angiotensin II. Replacement of the tyrosine residue by aspartic acid in TBI-22 greatly reduced the ability of the peptide to compete with angiotensin II for binding, suggesting an important contribution of this residue to the configuration required for recognition by the receptor.\r"

We have purified another proinflammatory protein that is chemotactic for human neutrophils from conditioned medium of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. After a series of steps that included anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC on cation-exchange and reverse-phase columns, an apparently pure protein was obtained that migrated as a single 7-kDa band on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The amino acid composition of this monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor was different from that of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 42 residues was determined. This portion of the molecule has up to 56% sequence similarity with several proteins that may be involved in host responses to infection or tissue injury. It is identical to a portion of a sequence deduced from an mRNA induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin treatment of human leukocytes. At the optimal concentration of 10 nM, 50% of neutrophils added to chemotaxis assay wells migrated toward the pure attractant. Potency and efficacy are comparable to that of fMet-Leu-Phe, which is often used as a reference. In contrast to many attractants, the protein was not chemotactic for human monocytes.\r"

In small-cell carcinomas, the incidence of allelic deletions at three different chromosomal loci was extremely high; loss of heterozygosity was detected on chromosomes 3p in 7 of 7 patients (100%), 13q in 10 of 11 patients (91%), and 17p in 5 of 5 patients (100%). The deletions at these loci in small-cell carcinomas were observed even in the tumors without any clinical evidence of metastasis. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3p and 13q occurred prior to NMYC amplification and chromosome 11p deletion. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 3p was also detected with high frequency in adenocarcinomas [5 of 6 patients (83%)]. Heterozygosity of chromosomes 13q and 17p was lost in 10 of 31 patients (32%) and in 3 of 12 patients (25%), respectively, of lung cancers other than small-cell carcinomas. These results indicate that recessive genetic changes involving sequences on chromosomes 3p, 13q, and 17p may play important roles in the genesis of small-cell carcinoma, and those on chromosome 3p may play an important role in the genesis of adenocarcinoma.\r"

EDRF is an unstable humoral substance released from artery and vein that mediates the action of endothelium-dependent vasodilators. NO is an unstable endothelium-independent vasodilator that is released from vasodilator drugs such as nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate. We have repeatedly observed that the actions of NO on vascular smooth muscle closely resemble those of EDRF. In the present study the vascular effects of EDRF released from perfused bovine intrapulmonary artery and vein were compared with the effects of NO delivered by superfusion over endothelium-denuded arterial and venous strips arranged in a cascade. EDRF was indistinguishable from NO in that both were labile (t1/2 = 3-5 sec), inactivated by pyrogallol or superoxide anion, stabilized by superoxide dismutase, and inhibited by oxyhemoglobin or potassium. Both EDRF and NO produced comparable increases in cyclic GMP accumulation in artery and vein, and this cyclic GMP accumulation was inhibited by pyrogallol, oxyhemoglobin, potassium, and methylene blue. EDRF was identified chemically as NO, or a labile nitroso species, by two procedures. First, like NO, EDRF released from freshly isolated aortic endothelial cells reacted with hemoglobin to yield nitrosylhemoglobin. Second, EDRF and NO each similarly promoted the diazotization of sulfanilic acid and yielded the same reaction product after coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine. Thus, EDRF released from artery and vein possesses identical biological and chemical properties as NO.\r"

Sixteen tumors retained the constitutional genotype along chromosome 22, while 14 tumors (40%) showed loss of one constitutional allele at all informative loci, consistent with monosomy 22 in the tumor DNA. The remaining 5 tumors (14%) showed loss of heterozygosity in the tumor DNA at one or more chromosome 22 loci and retained heterozygosity at other loci, consistent with variable terminal deletions of one chromosome 22 in the tumor DNA. The results suggest that a meningioma locus is located distal to the myoglobin locus, within 22q12.3-qter. Multiple loci on other chromosomes also were studied, and 12 of the 19 tumors with losses of chromosome 22 alleles showed additional losses of heterozygosity at loci on one to three other chromosomes. All tumors that retained the constitutional genotype on chromosome 22 also retained heterozygosity at all informative loci on other chromosomes analyzed, suggesting that the rearrangement of chromosome 22 is a primary event in the tumorigenesis of meningioma.\r"

A cDNA library, constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of ventral spinal cord, was screened with a mixture of eight oligonucleotides corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of pig brain ChoAcTase. Among five positive clones, one, pChAT-1, was identified as a ChoAcTase cDNA clone based on the following criteria. (i) This clone has an open reading frame coding for a protein of the size expected for ChoAcTase (640 amino acids). (ii) The amino acid composition deduced from the nucleotide sequence of this open reading frame matches that of purified porcine ChoAcTase. (iii) When subcloned in the T7 expression system, the corresponding RNA directs the synthesis in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate of a protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised against ChoAcTase. (iv) Finally and most important, this corresponding RNA, when translated in the reticulocyte lysate, as well as in the Xenopus oocyte system, directs the synthesis of a protein displaying ChoAcTase activity. This activity is inhibited by the specific ChoAcTase inhibitor 4-(1-naphthylvinyl)pyridine. Comparison of porcine ChoAcTase sequence with that of Drosophila reveals 32% identity between these proteins, when the sequences are suitably aligned. pChAT-1 probe hybridizes with a porcine mRNA species that is at least 7000 nucleotides long, whereas the equivalent rat mRNA species is 3700 nucleotides long.\r"

  ".W": "Recent progress in understanding phototransduction has come primarily from studies on cell-free systems. To investigate the transduction process under physiological conditions, a fully functional preparation of retinal rod outer segments without attached inner segments was developed that allows electrical recording of light-sensitive current during intracellular dialysis with defined solutions. No light-sensitive current is recorded from detached outer segments dialyzed with nucleotide-free solutions, whereas cells detached from the retina into Ringer's solution containing 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) develop a light-sensitive inward dark current. This indicates that there is a basal level of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity in the dark. Detached outer segments dialyzed with greater than or equal to 20 microM cGMP rapidly develop a light-suppressible current. A current of similar magnitude is generated more slowly during dialysis with a 50-fold greater concentration of GTP. Apparently, cGMP can be synthesized from GTP by guanylate cyclase in the outer segment. Cells dialyzed with cGMP alone show a reduced light sensitivity that is restored to normal by addition of 20 microM GTP. This action of GTP is antagonized by guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate. These findings are in good agreement with biochemical evidence indicating that a GTP-binding protein (transducin) plays a pivotal role in the generation of responses to light. The recovery of photocurrent following a brief flash is delayed or abolished by dialysis with solutions that lack ATP or contain guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. These results support the view that both GTP hydrolysis by activated transducin and ATP-dependent phosphorylation of a rhodopsin photoproduct are necessary for termination of the transduction process.\r"

The appearance of an EOD depends, in part, on the characteristic features of a single electrocyte's action potentials. In some species, gonadal steroid hormones induce increases in EOD duration, which mimic natural sex differences. We now show that testosterone-induced changes in EOD duration are associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the duration of action potentials generated by single electrocytes. Together with other anatomical and biochemical data, the results emphasize the exquisite interrelationship between steroid hormone action and the cellular machinery determining the electrical properties of single cells that underlie sexually dimorphic and seasonal behaviors.\r"

Whereas EtOH primarily affected the decay time constant of IA, having minimal effects on amplitude, BuOH and HxOH exerted their major effect on the amplitude of IA, reducing it, while their effects on decay kinetics were much less pronounced. The effects of EtOH on IA decay are cell specific among identified neurons of the Aplysia nervous system. The actions of BuOH and HxOH did not mimic these interneuronal differences. These data, coupled with data previously reported by us and others, make it unlikely that EtOH exerts its actions on IA via perturbation of a bulk lipid phase within the membrane.\r"

In the fluid of 10 endometriomas, the mean CA-125 concentration was 290 +/- 94 X 10(3) U/ml (range 10 to 900 X 10(3) U/ml). With cysts diameters greater than or equal to 4 cm, 19 of 19 women with endometriotic cysts, zero of seven women with nonendometriotic cysts and endometriosis, and zero of 20 women with nonendometriotic cysts had CA-125 concentrations greater than or equal to 20 U/ml (99% upper normal limit). We conclude that serum CA-125 determinations offer an excellent method to differentiate endometriotic from nonendometriotic benign cysts.\r"

Prostaglandins E2 and F2a were measured by radioimmunoassays. Preterm labor, in the absence of infection, was not associated with significant increases in amniotic fluid concentrations of prostaglandins. Women with preterm labor and intra-amniotic infections had higher amniotic fluid concentrations of prostaglandins than women with preterm labor in the absence of infection or women with intra-amniotic infection in the absence of labor. These observations are compatible with the participation of prostaglandins in the mechanisms of onset of preterm labor associated with intra-amniotic infection.\r"

Amnion, chorion, and decidua were obtained at elective cesarean section at term or at spontaneous labor. Cells were dispersed with collagenase and separated by density on discontinuous Percoll gradients. At cesarean section there was a major broad band of cells from amnion and chorion. This band contained most of the estrone sulfatase (estrone sulfate to estrone) activity. The 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (pregnenolone to progesterone conversion) and prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolizing activities were present in these cells and those that migrated at greater Percoll densities. Amnion and chorion obtained after spontaneous labor had two major bands of cells. Estrone sulfatase was present in cells from both hands, whereas progesterone output from pregnenolone and prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolism predominated in the second band of cells with greater density. This pattern was particularly apparent in chorion. Dispersed cells from decidua tended to migrate throughout the gradient. In general, estrone sulfate to estrone conversion predominated in lighter cells whereas progesterone output from pregnenolone and prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolism predominated in cells of greater density. The output of progesterone from pregnenolone was significantly lower in cell preparations from chorion and decidua at spontaneous labor compared with cesarean section. We conclude that human amnion, chorion, and decidua contain distinct cell subpopulations based on Percoll migration and that in the membranes these change between cesarean section and spontaneous labor. Partial separation of estrone sulfatase from 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolizing activities has been demonstrated, which raises the possibility of paracrine interactions in vivo.\r"

Two daily injections (5-20 mg/kg/d) of citalopram or GBR-12909 (uptake blocking agents for 5-HT and dopamine, respectively) did not modify the increased level of ethanol intake. The noradrenaline uptake blocking agent, talsupram (5-10 mg/kg/d), however, decreased ethanol intake to the levels seen prior to deprivation. This effect of talsupram could be antagonized by blocking alpha-1-adrenoreceptors with prazosin (1 mg/kg/d).\r"

We also studied contact hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) introduced through UV-treated epidermis. C3H/HeN mice were exposed to UVB or 8-methoxypsoralen plus UVA (PUVA). UVB and PUVA treatment led to a dramatic reduction in surface marker expression of both Ia + LC and Thy-I + dEC. High-dose UVB irradiation (360 J/m2) interfered with contact hypersensitivity to DNFB; the density of Ia + LC may thus be related to the sensitizing potential. In contrast, low-dose UVB (120 J/m2) and PUVA treatment had little effect on contact hypersensitivity despite a marked reduction in Ia + LC. The density of Thy-I + dEC appeared not to be associated with contact hypersensitivity. These results suggest that there may be a Langerhans cell density-independent mechanism for the induction of contact hypersensitivity.\r"

We investigated in the 3 patients (outside of the acute phase of the HUS) and in 12 other first degree relatives complement components (C3, C4, C1q, factor B), coagulation factors (i.e., antithrombin III, F VIII, protein C) prostacyclin regulating plasma factor and vitamin E levels: all results were normal. Renal failure was irreversible in the 3 patients, despite fresh plasma infusions in 2 of them. After a 7 to 32-month period on hemodialysis, the 3 patients were transplanted with a cadaver kidney. Twenty-one to 94 months later, they have a functioning graft and no recurrence of the HUS. We conclude that, in this family, HUS is not linked to HLA or female gender. No phenotypic marker of the disease was found. Evolution after dialysis and transplantation is excellent, with no short term recurrence of the HUS.\r"

Alkaline secretion was measured after pretreatment with ranitidine to abolish the H+ secretion using a constant perfusion aspiration system and back titration of the perfusates to the original pH 6.0. Luminal release of PGE2 was also measured in the gastric and duodenal perfusates. Addition of De-Nol in gradually increasing concentrations resulted in step wise increments in gastric HCO3- secretion in man and in dogs reaching, respectively, about 80% and 55% of the maximal HCO3- response to 16, 16dimethyl-PGE2 (dmPGE2). The duodenal HCO3- response to De-Nol in dogs reached 72% of the dmPGE2 maximum. These effects were accompanied by a significant increase in luminal release of PGE2. Pretreatment with atropine reduced basal and in part De-Nol induced alkaline secretion, whereas pirenzepine did not affect this secretion in man and dogs. Aspirin (in man) and indomethacin (in dogs) reduced the release of PGE2 by about 80% and suppressed almost completely the gastric and duodenal HCO3- response to De-Nol in these species. This study provides evidence that De-Nol stimulates gastroduodenal alkaline secretion through a prostaglandin dependent mechanism.\r"

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and alpha, beta-methylene ATP, as well as adenosine, stimulate the output of PGE2 in a concentration dependent-manner. Potency of these compounds is in the order of alpha, beta-methylene ATP greater than ATP greater than adenosine. The effect of ATP was totally blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Actions of these adenylyl compounds were attenuated by apamin, an antagonist of postjunctional P2-purinoceptor-mediated activity. Effectiveness of these compounds was not modified by 8-phenyltheophylline, a P1-purinoceptor antagonist, and it was not obtained in the isolated synaptosomal preparations. In addition, effects of adenosine and adenosine nucleotides were augmented only slightly by dipyridamole, a blocker of adenosine uptake. These findings suggest that the formation of PGE2 is stimulated in muscle cells, through the postjunctional P2-purinoceptor, taking an active role in the purinergic neurotransmission of guinea pig gut.\r"

In type III the changes were located in the central part of the nail bed with no connection to the margins. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of normal fingernails with various wavelengths showed that 3% to 20% of the irradiation could penetrate the nail. The different patterns of photodamage might be caused by the nail acting as a lens. Less protection by lack of melanin and absence of sebum and stratum granulosum may favor penetration of UV irradiation and explain why the skin was not always affected.\r"

Reduced heart-rate variation was frequently associated with sphincter disturbance and orthostatic hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred seventeen women who received 3 mg of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) gel applied to the cervix followed by adjunctive oxytocin were compared to 94 patients whose labor was induced with oxytocin alone (OA). Postdatism, pregnancy-induced hypertension and rupture of the membranes were the major indications for induction of labor, accounting for 70% of the PGE2 group and 88% of the OA group. Mean initial cervical scores were found to be significantly less favorable among PGE2 patients as compared with OA patients. Though PGE2 was associated with a significant improvement in mean cervical scores, responsiveness of the cervix to PGE2, as determined by clinical examination, was not necessary for a successful induction. Failed inductions were infrequent in both groups. Nulliparous PGE2 patients with unfavorable cervical scores had fewer cesarean sections (CSs) and shorter labors than did their OA counterparts. Complications were uncommon but largely due to the subsequent use of oxytocin. Patients with prior CSs were safely induced following PGE2 cervical ripening.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanically induced vasodilatation or flare on the skin, known as dermatographia, is a common clinical observation in fibrositis syndrome and is thought to be a neurogenically mediated axon reflex response. In our study, mechanically and chemically induced flares were quantitated in 13 patients with fibrositis syndrome and 14 control subjects. There was a reduced threshold for chemically induced flare response and the area of flare was greater in patients compared to controls, although there was a wide range of responses in both groups. There was also a significant positive correlation between mechanically and chemically induced flares, and the number of tender points in all subjects correlated with the size of the chemically induced flare. We suggest that exaggerated neurogenic inflammatory responses in patients with fibrositis syndrome reflect increased activity of polymodal nociceptors of unmyelinated primary afferent nerves. This increased receptor activity may also contribute to the pain and tenderness experienced by these patients.\r"

In Spain, Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly isolated organism (73%). This emphasizes the geographic variations in the causative germs since, in contrast to other reports, we have not identified any gram negative bacillary arthritis in our population of heroin users. Our data show that the 67gallium citrate scintigraphy is positive earlier than the 99mTc-MDP bone scan in the poorly vascularized joints (p less than 0.0005). The early localization of the infectious focus by 67gallium citrate scintigraphy followed by a prompt bacteriologic diagnosis (blood, synovial fluid or tissue cultures) allowed good therapeutic results.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic effects and immune responses of different levels of fish oil in enteral formulas for postburn nutritional support were studied. Thirty-seven burned guinea pigs with previously placed gastrostomy feeding tubes were given diets containing 5, 15, 30, or 50% of nonprotein calories as fish oil. These diets were isonitrogenous, isocaloric, and contained identical amounts of vitamins and minerals. After 14 days of enteral feeding, there were no significant differences in resting metabolic expenditure, serum transferrin, and albumin levels. Weight loss was significantly greater in groups receiving 30 and 50% of fish oil compared to groups which received 5 and 15% of fish oil. Carcass weights and liver weights of animals in the two groups that received diets with higher lipid content were also significantly lower. Cell-mediated immunity, macrophage bactericidal indices, and opsonic indices were not different among the groups. This study confirms that diets containing lower levels of lipids are more effective for enteral nutritional support than those containing higher levels. In contrast to linoleic acid rich lipid sources, higher levels of fish oil did not show adverse effects on immunity possibly because it contained high concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids which are not precursors of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of fish oil on the progression of renal insufficiency in rats with subtotal nephrectomy. Five weeks after a 1-2/3 nephrectomy, sixteen rats were fed two different diets which differed only in fat composition. Lipid in the control diet was primarily beef tallow; that of the experimental diet, menhaden oil. Fish oil-fed rats had significant increases in plasma creatinines, decreases in urinary PGE2 and accelerated death rates. An additional twelve rats underwent 1-1/3 nephrectomies, and the same dietary manipulations, followed by renal clearance, histologic and biochemical studies after 12 weeks on the diets. Fish oil-fed rats again did worse, with decreased glomerular filtration rates and filtration fractions, more proteinuria and more glomerular sclerosis. Glomeruli and slices of cortex, medulla and papillae from rats fed fish oil produced much less PGE2 and TXB2 than dietary controls. Fish oil-induced suppression of renal PGE2 may be deleterious in this model and may outweigh the beneficial effect derived from TXA2 suppression. In contrast to fish oil's potentially therapeutic role in cardiovascular and immune-mediated renal disease, this diet is detrimental in rat renoprival nephropathy. This illustrates the importance of examining the effects of fatty acid manipulation individually for each disease entity.\r"

The values were compared with 37 normal adult controls, 29 of whom had complete data for all biochemical parameters. Eleven of the CAPD patients were studied a second time, 3 to 8 months after the first study. Initially, after 20 +/- 8 months of CAPD compared (P less than 0.05, only) to controls, the patients had normal or increased activities of the enzymes pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in contrast to previous results from hemodialyzed patients; but adenylate kinase, ATP, and protein synthesis were reduced. Concentrations of many amino acids in plasma were abnormal, including reduced valine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, as noted by others. Histidine, glutamic acid, and citrulline especially were increased. The intracellular concentrations of the essential amino acids were within normal limits, but citrulline, glycine, and taurine levels were markedly increased while glutamic acid and SAGN (serine + asparagine + glutamine) were decreased. With the second study, intracellular energy-related bioactivities and the abnormal concentrations of the amino acids in plasma were essentially unchanged. However, virtually all the intracellular amino acid concentrations were higher. These results also were in striking contrast to previously reported hemodialysis patients in whom the intracellular concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids and methionine as well as protein synthesis were strikingly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which high protein intake increases filtration rate and kidney hypertrophy in health and may be detrimental to the kidney in chronic renal failure are not well understood. We studied the kidneys of Sprague Dawley rats fed high (HP) and low (LP) isocaloric protein diets (32% and 10% casein, respectively) for 4 weeks. HP induced significant increases in kidney mass, GFR, and maximum urine concentrating ability (UMax). Kidney hypertrophy was characterized by (1) a selective increase in thickness of the inner stripe of the outer medulla (IS, +54%, P less than 0.001) while total kidney height (from cortex to papillary tip) increased only by 18%; (2) a considerable hypertrophy of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) in the IS (+43% epithelium volume/unit tubular length) but not in the outer stripe nor in the cortex; and (3), an increase in heterogeneity of glomerular volume between superficial and deep nephrons (P less than 0.05). these morphologic changes parallel those we previously reported in rats fed a normal protein diet (25% casein) but in which the operation of the urine concentrating mechanism was chronically stimulated by ADH infusion or by reduction in water intake. In contrast, normal kidney growth with age or kidney hypertrophy induced by uninephrectomy were not accompanied by preferential enlargement of IS structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All the strains were susceptible to pefloxacin, vancomycin, and rifampin. Oxacillin-resistant strains were uniformly resistant to cephalothin and were more likely to be resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than were oxacillin-susceptible strains. Time-kill studies with 23 strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus indicated that the relative order of bactericidal activities was gentamicin greater than or equal to pefloxacin greater than oxacillin greater than vancomycin greater than rifampin. Pefloxacin combined with oxacillin or vancomycin killed staphylococci more rapidly than oxacillin or vancomycin alone but less rapidly than pefloxacin alone. Gentamicin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or pefloxacin resulted in the most rapid killing of gentamicin-susceptible strains. Rifampin combined with oxacillin, vancomycin, or pefloxacin reduced the bactericidal activities of those drugs, but rifampin resistance was not observed as it was with rifampin alone. Pefloxacin is a potentially useful antistaphylococcal agent.\r"

The MICs of imipenem and CGP 31608 for methicillin-resistant strains were lower than the MICs of nafcillin or cefamandole for these strains; these differences diminished in the presence of 2.5% NaCl. Subpopulations were detected in strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis that were resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested at 5 micrograms/ml. This resistant subpopulation produced progeny that were uniformly resistant to high concentrations of each of the beta-lactams.\r"

  ".W": "Entry of antibiotics into phagocytes is necessary for activity against intracellular organisms. Therefore, we examined the uptake of five of the newer antibiotics--roxithromycin (RU 965), imipenem, cefotaxime, trimethoprim, and metronidazole--by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Antibiotic uptake by PMN was determined by a velocity gradient centrifugation technique and expressed as the ratio of the cellular concentration of antibiotic to the extracellular concentration (C/E). Cefotaxime, like other beta-lactam antibiotics, was taken up poorly by phagocytes (C/E less than or equal to 0.3). The metronidazole concentration within PMN was similar to the extracellular level. Imipenem bound rapidly to phagocytes (C/E = 3), but cell-associated drug progressively declined during the incubation period. Trimethoprim was well concentrated by PMN (C/E = 9 to 13), and uptake was unexpectedly greater at 25 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The most striking finding was that roxithromycin was more avidly concentrated by PMN (C/E = 34) than any other antibiotic we studied. Entry of roxithromycin into phagocytes was an active process and displayed saturation kinetics characteristic of a carrier-mediated membrane transport system. Ingestion of microbial particles by PMN slightly decreased the ability of these cells to accumulate roxithromycin (C/E = 24 to 31). These studies identified two antibiotics, trimethoprim and especially roxithromycin, which are markedly concentrated within human PMN and may prove useful in treatment of infections caused by susceptible intracellular organisms.\r"

For disk diffusion, the bacteria were directly suspended in saline and immediately swabbed onto 15-cm agar plates. Disks of cefoxitin (30 micrograms), chloramphenicol (30 micrograms), clindamycin (2 micrograms), moxalactam (30 micrograms), imipenem (10 micrograms), and ticarcillin (75 micrograms) were applied, and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Zone sizes were measured at 24 h. The results of disk diffusion and agar dilution were compared by regression analysis by the method of least squares and by the error rate-bounded method. Zones were easily measured for 216 strains (96%). The correlation between the MICs and diameters of inhibition for cefoxitin, clindamycin, moxalactam, and ticarcillin was generally good. A correlation could not be established for chloramphenicol and imipenem, as there were too few resistant strains. With the recommended resistance breakpoints, the following susceptible and resistant zone diameter breakpoints could be established: cefoxitin, less than or equal to 19 and greater than or equal to 21 mm; clindamycin, less than or equal to 14 and greater than or equal to 18 mm; moxalactam, less than or equal to 21 and greater than or equal to 25 mm; and ticarcillin, less than or equal to 15 and greater than or equal to 16 mm. By applying these zone criteria, the percentage of false-susceptible strains was less than 1% and of false-resistant strains was less than 4% for the drugs tested.\r"

In the fecal flora, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were eliminated between days 2 and 8. The alterations in streptococci and anaerobic flora were not significant; Bacteroides fragilis was more resistant to pefloxacin after treatment. Clostridium difficile was not detected, and there was no overgrowth by yeasts. No side effects were observed.\r"

A virus-syncytial sensitive clone of CEM cells (CEM-SS) was identified and made adherent to flat bottom 96-well microtiter dishes. Following the addition of virus, these cells develop easily quantifiable, adherent syncytia on a background of confluent, normal CEM-SS monolayer in 4 to 6 days. One-hit kinetics for syncytia formation were obtained at various multiplicities of infection. Syncytia are associated with complete virion production and cytoplasmic localization of the p24 core protein (detected by immunofluorescence). Total infectious virus can be accurately determined in this assay; these results showed a close correlation with p24 and gp120 induction when microtiter well supernatants were passed to fresh cells and evaluated by competitive radioimmunoassay. Studies of p24 antigen induction at and beyond the end point of syncytia formation indicate that there are no detectable nonsyncytial variants in standard HIV-I stocks. Six divergent HIV-I isolates (HTLV-IIIB, -RFII, -MN, -RUTZ, -CC, and LAV-1), as well as HTLV-IIIB and LAV-1 reisolated from persistently infected chimpanzees, produce quantifiable syncytia which vary slightly in their developmental morphology. Accurate neutralization titers are readily obtained from easily constructed multiplicity curves derived from serial dilutions of test sera. Inherent within this system is a flexible method for studying various kinetics of antibody/virus interactions, as well as blocking and interference studies with any candidate antiviral compounds.\r"

AIDS, ARC, other disease or tumor patients and healthy people were sampled from 1984-1986. By radioimmunoprecipitation and SDS/PAGE analysis and/or Western blot we failed to find any samples with specific antibodies to HIV-2/HTLV-4 indicative of infection. In contrast, 363 of these 1508 individuals demonstrated antibodies to HIV-1/HTLV-3B by the same serologic assays. HIV-2/HTLV-4 infection appears to be quite rare in Central Africa. AIDS and related syndromes in this study were exclusively correlated with HIV-1 infection. Studies in West Africa have shown high rates of infection with HIV-2/HTLV-4 where cases of AIDS are still relatively uncommon. These results indicate that HIV-2/HTLV-4 has a distinct geographic distribution from that of HIV-1 in Africa. Further studies are necessary to better define the pathogenicity and natural history of this distinct new virus, HIV-2/HTLV-4.\r"

From these patients two groups were randomly selected. Group 1 (30 patients) had a favorable course, and Group 2 (30 patients) had an unfavorable course. Using the discriminant analysis we calculated a linear discriminant function and a cut-off score. The two groups were thereby separated according to their scores (characteristic values) from their marker values. The scores accurately reflected the clinical course in 55 of the 60 patients (91.7%). This discriminant function was then used to make a prognosis in 49 patients. In 21 patients an elevated characteristic value (greater than or equal to cut-off score) indicated disease progression 5 months before clinical confirmation was possible. The remaining 28 patients scored below the cut-off point. From six to 65 months (mean, 26.2) after surgery all are free of recurrence. It is concluded that invasive procedures, second-look laparotomy, for instance, may not be necessary in following up ovarian cancer patients with normal tumor marker profiles.\r"

  ".W": "In 115 primary colorectal carcinomas and 64 normal colorectal mucosa specimens the concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, and CA 125 were measured. The determinations were performed in cytosols by use of radioimmunometric and enzymeimmunometric assays and related to the wet tissue weight. In the cancer tissue the CEA levels ranged from 5.5 to 1990 micrograms/g tissue and were significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) than those found in the normal mucosa (1.2-58.6 micrograms/g). The CA 19-9 content in carcinoma specimens (120-72660 U/g) was also significantly higher (P = 0.011) than in the normal mucosa (37-5800 U/g). In contrast, no significant difference of the CA 125 concentrations between the normal and the cancer tissue was found. The relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the three markers corroborate CEA as the marker superior to CA 19-9. On the other hand is shown that CA 125 is completely unable to discriminate between normal and cancer tissues. A decreasing CEA tissue concentration and an increasing dedifferentiation of colorectal cancers were significantly (P = 0.018) related with each other. Higher tumor stages implied significantly higher tissue marker values of CA 19-9 (P = 0.027) and CA 125 (P = 0.0008). The findings correspond quite well with serum examinations of the three markers which have been reported earlier.\r"
