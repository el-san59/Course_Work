  ".U": "90120940\r", 
  ".W": "Neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia (NOD), common among rehabilitation populations, is a risk factor for aspiration. A history of recurrent aspiration is an indication for gastric feedings according to some physicians, although according to others it is a contraindication to gastric feedings and an indication for jejunal feedings. In light of these divergent opinions, the literature from 1978 to 1989 on aspiration in patients with severe NOD was examined to determine whether empiric evidence supports the preferential use of a gastric or a jejunal feeding site. The data reviewed did not support the preferential use of either feeding site. Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies compared aspiration rates in patients receiving gastric feedings to those receiving jejunal feedings. Another study reported complications with gastric and jejunal feedings but did not compare the two feeding groups. Forty-two studies evaluated either gastric (36) or jejunal (6) feedings. The relative risks of aspiration associated with gastric and jejunal feedings could not be determined reliably because of heterogenous and inadequately described patient populations, poorly described data collection methods, nonoperational definitions of aspiration, small sample sizes, and unspecified time frames, feeding protocols, and care settings. Few data about long-term jejunal feeding, extremely variable data on the risk of aspiration during long-term gastric feeding, and much variation in clinical practice support a need for further research designed to determine the proper role for gastric and jejunal feeding. Recommendations for research and the role of the rehabilitation team in determining the best enterostomy site are suggested.\r"

Without edrophonium, repetitive stimulation studies were normal. After 5mg of edrophonium was administered intravenously, a 40% decrement was recorded using 3Hz stimulation and an 80% decrement was seen with 30Hz stimulation. It is concluded that edrophonium is useful in testing for poisoning with cholinesterase inhibitors when other electrophysiologic studies are normal. These changes are most likely due to a recently described fast desensitization of the acetylcholine (ACh) receptor induced by high ACh concentrations.\r"

All three tumors were removed intact and proved on histopathologic evaluation to be localized neurofibromas. The patient had complete relief of the chronic pain following removal of the tumors. We emphasize that the unusual occurrence of multiple circumscribed orbital tumors should suggest the diagnosis of neurofibroma even in the absence of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis.\r"

  ".W": "In the last several years, the biologic modification of the immune system has become one of the therapeutic alternatives in medicine. The use of interferon alpha has resulted in both antineoplastic and antiviral effects in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Trials currently underway will determine whether or not this drug, either alone or in combination with zidovudine, is of overall value to patients with early stages of HIV-1 infection. Hematopoietic growth factors, GM-CSF and erythropoietin in particular, offer new hope that the bone marrow suppressing toxicities of certain therapeutic agents such as zidovudine and ganciclovir can be ameliorated, thus allowing the more aggressive use of these important medications. Although a variety of non-biologic immunomodulators have been evaluated in patients with HIV-1 infection, none thus far has shown the clear clinical advantage that has been demonstrated for zidovudine and a variety of clinical trials continue in this area. The area of immunologic reconstitution, although promising in concept, has been disappointing in practice, even in combination with zidovudine. Recent approaches to immunomodulation have included active immunotherapy involving immunization of HIV-1 infected individuals with either inactivated virus or recombinant HIV-1 proteins. Continued investigation of the role of immunomodulation in the therapy of patients with HIV-1 infection should be of value, not only in developing better therapies for patients with HIV-infection, but also in helping develop a better understanding of the nature of the immunologic defects seen in the context of this infection.\r"

  ".W": "Naturally occurring HIV variants show distinct biologic features that correspond to the severity of HIV infection. Virus from asymptomatic HIV carriers or individuals with mild disease replicates slowly and inefficiently in the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. Attempts to passage these viruses in CD4-positive cell lines usually fail or result in transient replication only. In contrast, viruses from patients with severe immunodeficiency replicate rapidly and efficiently in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures as well as cell lines: hence the designation slow/low and rapid/high, respectively. These two groups of viruses can also be distinguished by the type of cytopathogenicity exerted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Rapid/high viruses are characterized by extensive syncytia formation, whereas syncytia are rarely seen with slow/low viruses. Instead cultures infected with slow/low viruses show signs of cell death or no cytopathic changes at all. It has also been observed that shift from the slow/low type of virus to rapid/high may occur in the same individual over time. Whether this change signals the emergence of HIV variants with increased virulence or reflects the damage to the immune system that can no longer control virus replication remains to be seen. Rapid/high and slow/low viruses can also be distinguished by cell tropism when tested in a model system on indicator cell lines of T-lymphoid or monocytoid origin. Infection by rapid/high viruses activates chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in both T-lymphoid and monocytoid indicator cells, whereas slow/low viruses activate chloramphenicol acetyl transferase only in monocytoid cell lines. A difference between slow/low and rapid/high viruses cannot be demonstrated in fresh normal macrophage cultures, since most isolates can be successfully passaged in macrophages. Whether the viruses that infect macrophages are truly macrophage-tropic or dual-tropic, and infect macrophages and lymphocytes with equal efficiency, remains to be studied.\r"

The downregulation is effected at a posttranscriptional level since the amounts of HLA class I specific mRNA are similar in infected and uninfected cells. This phenomenon is not only correlated with the state of infection, that is, the presence of P24 of HIV-1 in the cells, but also depends on the time of infection. Upon HLA class I downregulation by HIV infection, the specific lysis of peripheral blood cells by allogeneic CTL is reduced.\r"

None had symptoms or signs of AIDS-related complex or AIDS. sCD8 levels were significantly higher in 18 patients who had HIV antibody (Ab) compared with 18 patients who were HIV Ab negative (1640 +/- 578 virus 804 +/- 264 U/ml, p less than 0.0001). In HIV Ab+ patients but not in HIV Ab- patients, sCD8 levels significantly correlated with percentages and absolute numbers of activated CD3+DR+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p = 0.0024 and 0.0183, respectively). Also in HIV Ab+ patients, CIC levels were significantly greater for both anti-C3 binding (13.1 +/- 11.1 versus 2.9 +/- 3.4 micrograms/ml, p = 0.002) and C1q binding (23.5 +/- 20.2 versus 6.3 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml, p = 0.001) CIC. Serum C4 concentrations were lower in the HIV Ab+ patient group (33.9 +/- 10.1 versus 41.6 +/- 12.4 mg/dL, p = 0.043). In the seropositive group, IgG levels were higher (2206 +/- 859 versus 1615 +/- 645 mg/dl) and total CD4 cell counts were lower (757 +/- 344 versus 1172 +/- 402 cells per mm3), but at a less significant level (p = 0.024 and 0.005, respectively), than that seen for sCD8 and C1q CIC differences. These results suggest that elevations of both the lymphocyte activation marker sCD8 and antigen nonspecific CIC characterize earlier stages of HIV infection in IVDA.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured continuously by direct measurement of the outflow of the posterior sagittal sinus. Arterial and sagittal sinus blood-gas tensions were measured intermittently for calculation of cerebral metabolism. Systemic pressures were measured continuously with intermittent measurements of cardiac output. These doses of fentanyl had minimal effect on cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen consumption and the energy state of the brain reflected by the normal concentration of cerebral metabolites at the end of the study. There was also little effect on systemic haemodynamics. It is concluded that, in the absence of other anaesthetic agents which might influence cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism, large doses of fentanyl have little effect on the cerebral circulation.\r"

A digital flow controller incorporated in a computerized high frequency jet ventilator was used to deliver either a single deep breath or a series of three deep breaths. On user request, HFJV was interrupted and the deep breaths delivered, after which HFJV was resumed. Using a mathematical model, we were able to predict accurately the pressures to which the lungs would be inflated during deep breaths. The effect of varying the deep breath pressure (Pdb) on the ratio of end-tidal PCO2 to arterial (PCO2 (PECO2:PaCO2) was studied in three dogs. In all the dogs, within an optimum Pdb range of 5-10 cm H2O, PECO2 during the first deep breath was found to be similar (+/- 0.2 kPa) to the PaCO2 immediately before the onset of deep breaths. Deep breaths delivered above or below the optimum Pdb range resulted in a decrease in the ratio PECO2:PaCO2. The frequency of jet ventilation (12-200 b.p.m.) before the onset of the deep breaths did not affect PECO2:PaCO2.\r"

End-expiratory volumes were altered by changing the pressure in a plethysmographic box in which the dogs underwent ventilation. The pressures studied were atmospheric, sub-atmospheric (box pressure -1.0 kPa) and increased atmospheric (box pressure + 0.5 kPa). The results indicated that more carbon dioxide was eliminated at low lung volumes and this was most pronounced with HFV at 50 Hz and continuous flow. It is postulated that changes in airway geometry and different lung volumes may alter the distance between the gas interface in the conductive airways and the respiratory zone and so alter the efficiency of ventilation during FDV.\r"

Treatment with ganciclovir was begun on a protocol which provided two weeks of inpatient therapy at daily doses of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg followed by outpatient therapy at a reduced dosage three to six days per week. Outpatient maintenance dosage ranged from 15 mg/kg per week to 30 mg/kg per week. In seven eyes of six patients the treatment decreased retinal inflammation and stabilised the margins of the lesions. Six patients have tolerated long term maintenance therapy for 10-30 weeks. Six of seven patients (85%) in this study developed side effects from ganciclovir which required periods of a reduction in dosage or interruption of therapy. The side effects from ganciclovir included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, drug fever, and neuropathy. Physicians using ganciclovir in AIDS patients must watch for the signs of drug toxicity and adjust treatment accordingly. Ganciclovir appears to be a promising therapy for CMV retinitis, but further work is necessary to determine the best regimen for optimal efficacy with minimal side effects.\r"

  ".U": "90123172\r", 
  ".W": "Guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) are regulatory molecules that couple membrane receptors to effector systems such as adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C. The alpha subunits of G proteins bind to guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) in the unstimulated state and guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP) in the active state. Tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide), a specific inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, decreases guanylate synthesis from IMP in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and depletes intracellular guanine nucleotide pools. This study demonstrates that treatment of HL-60 cells with tiazofurin is associated with a fourfold increase in membrane binding sites for the nonhydrolyzable analogue GDP beta S. This increase in binding sites was associated with a 3.2-fold decrease in GDP beta S binding affinity. Similar findings were obtained with GTP gamma S. These effects of tiazofurin treatment on guanine nucleotide binding were also associated with decreased adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation of specific G protein substrates by cholera and pertussis toxin. The results further demonstrate that tiazofurin treatment results in inhibition of G protein-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms. In this regard, stimulation of adenylate cyclase by prostaglandin E2 was inhibited by over 50% in tiazofurin-treated cells. Furthermore, tiazofurin treatment resulted in inhibition of N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced stimulation of phospholipase C. Taken together, these results indicate that tiazofurin acts at least in part by inhibiting the ability of G proteins to function as transducers of intracellular signals.\r"

Treatment with TGF-beta alone did not significantly affect growth or differentiation of HL60 cells, while it significantly inhibited proliferation and induced monocytic differentiation of a small percentage of U937 cells. Combinations of TGF-beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) acted in synergy to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce monocytic differentiation of both HL60 and U937 cells. In contrast, no synergy was observed when HL60 cells were treated with TGF-beta in various combinations with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and retinoic acid. Examination of TNF-alpha receptor expression on HL60 and U937 cells showed that these cell lines expressed comparable levels of high-affinity TNF-alpha binding sites. Treatment of HL60 and U937 cells with TGF-beta did not induce significant changes in TNF-alpha receptor expression in either cell line. In contrast, HL60 cells expressed much lower levels of TGF-beta receptors than did U937 cells. Treatment of both HL60 and U937 cells with TNF-alpha induced a dose-dependent increase in expression of TGF-beta receptors, suggesting that the synergy between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta may result, at least in part, from upregulation of TGF-beta receptor expression by TNF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Hemophilia A (HA), a common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, is due to the deficiency or absence of the factor VIII (FVIII) activity. The cloning of the FVIII gene has made molecular probes available for the characterization of the basic defect in this disease. In this study we describe six different mutations in the FVIII gene detected by DNA analysis of 100 HA patients of Italian descent. In two of them, with a severe clinical picture, we identified two novel deletions, one in the middle of the FVIII gene from exons 7 to 22 and the other encompassing the entire factor VIII gene. Both of these patients produced antibodies to factor VIII. In a patient with mild HA we detected a duplication of exon 13, which is a rearrangement not yet described within the FVIII gene. A possible explanation for the mild phenotype in this patient is that the molecular defect results in the production of an unstable FVIII protein with residual 10% FVIII activity. Screening by Taq I restriction endonuclease detected three mutations that were further characterized by direct sequencing on amplified DNA: a C-T substitution at codon 1960, in exon 18, converting the codon for arginine to a non-sense codon; and a G-A substitution at codon 2228 and 2326, in exons 24 and 26 respectively, resulting in the substitution of glutamine for arginine. All three of these mutations have been previously described. The non-sense mutation and the codon 2228 G-A mutation was found in patients with severe HA, while the codon 2326 G-A mutation was associated with a quite severe condition. These results confirm that the molecular bases of HA are very heterogeneous and provide further evidence that recurrent mutations are not uncommon in this system.\r"

  ".W": "Release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its interaction with plasma protease inhibitors were studied in two patients with massive defibrination, one after electroshock and soft tissue injury and the other after complicated labor; both had very severe hemorrhage. Large quantities of free t-PA were present in the circulation for several hours. Complexes of t-PA with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), alpha 2-macroglobulin and C1-inhibitor were also observed. PAI-1 antigen rose dramatically in both patients, and complexes of t-PA with PAI-1 rose rapidly during the period of observation. In contrast, the complexes of t-PA with alpha 2-macroglobulin and C1-inhibitor, present initially, persisted for short periods only and disappeared when free t-PA disappeared from the circulation. Plasmin was generated initially, as indicated by the presence of plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes. Plasma concentrations of alpha 2-macroglobulin, C1-inhibitor, antithrombin III, and alpha 2-antiplasmin were severely depleted initially, but rapidly returned to normal. The observations demonstrate that there is a major release of t-PA in such defibrinating patients, that there is a role for protease inhibitors other than PAI-1 in the regulation of endogenous t-PA, and indicate the great rapidity with which such free t-PA is complexed and cleared.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of cytokines on basal and agonist-stimulated release of von Willebrand factor (vWf) by human endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells for up to 48 hours with human recombinant or purified interleukin 1 (IL-1) or human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) did not significantly affect constitutive secretion of vWf or intracellular levels of vWf, although basal prostacyclin (PGI2) production was markedly enhanced. In contrast, both IL-1 and TNF-alpha modulated vWf release in response to thrombin or phorbol ester. Pretreatment of endothelial cells for 2 hours with either cytokine enhanced by up to threefold the stimulatory effect of a subsequent 60-minute exposure to thrombin. Addition of cycloheximide (5 micrograms/mL) during the preincubation abolished this enhancement. Moreover, if the cytokine pretreatment time was extended to 24 hours, agonist-stimulated vWf release was significantly suppressed. Cytokine treatment for 2 or 24 hours had no detectable effect on levels of vWf messenger RNA. The effects of cytokines were not the result of contamination with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and were not attributable to endothelial cell injury. These results show that cytokines have little or no direct effect on vWf release from endothelial cells but can significantly modulate its acute release in response to other stimuli in a complex time- and dose-dependent manner.\r"

  ".U": "90123192\r", 
  ".W": "The characteristic lesion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the failure of myeloid cells to differentiate normally, leading to the accumulation of immature blast cells (BC) in the bone marrow. We determined whether BC and leukemia colony-forming cells (L-CFC) from AML patients could differentiate in vitro after short-term culture with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), retinoic acid (RA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Expression of myeloid differentiation antigens CD15, CD14, CD33, and p124 was determined on the BC by immunofluorescence and on the L-CFC by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and complement (C')-mediated cytotoxicity followed by cloning in methylcellulose. We found that 26 of 39 (67%) cases demonstrated changes in the expression of myeloid differentiation antigens on the BC, and 6 of 7 (86%) cases showed an altered L-CFC myeloid antigen phenotype after short-term culture with differentiating agents. Alterations in myeloid antigen expression in the L-CFC population correlated with a reduction in L-CFC cloning potential. In the BC, alterations of myeloid differentiation antigens occurred in a manner consistent with those observed during normal myelopoiesis. For example, CD14 antigen expression (a late-stage monocyte antigen) increased on BC from 12 of 39 (31%) cases, and p124 (an antigen expressed both by myeloid progenitor cells and by a subset of monocytes) increased on 15 of 39 (38%) cases. Changes in the expression of CD33 antigens (expressed normally by myeloid progenitor cells and by mature monocytes) on the BC were variable, with 7 of 29 cases (24%) showing a decrease and 7 of 29 cases (24%) showing an increase. When comparisons were made between pairs of differentiation agents that caused the altered expression of an antigen on either the BC or L-CFC of a patient, the majority of changes were in the same direction (either both \"increased\" or both \"decreased\"). This suggests that the direction of antigen change is characteristic of the leukemia cell subpopulation for each patient and not of the stimulatory agent. This study demonstrates that cells from more than two thirds of AML cases examined responded to various differentiation agents in vitro as measured by changes in the expression of myeloid cell-associated surface antigens and by alterations in cloning potential of the L-CFC, a finding of potential clinical significance.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the high rate of forceps delivery associated with the use of epidural analgesia could be reduced through giving an intravenous infusion of oxytocin during the second stage of labour. DESIGN--A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. SETTING--Delivery suites in three hospitals. SUBJECTS--226 Primiparous women with adequate epidural analgesia in whom full dilatation of the cervix had been achieved without prior stimulation with oxytocin. INTERVENTION--An infusion of oxytocin or placebo starting at the diagnosis of full cervical dilatation at an initial dose rate of 2 mU/min increasing to a maximum of 16 mU/min. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The outcome of labour was assessed in terms of the duration of the second stage, mode of delivery, fetal condition at birth, postpartum blood loss, and the incidence of perineal trauma. RESULTS--Treatment with oxytocin was associated with a shorter second stage (p = 0.01), a reduction in the number of non-rotational forceps deliveries (p = 0.03), and less perineal trauma (p = 0.03) but was not associated with any reduction in the number of rotational forceps deliveries performed for malposition of the occiput. No adverse effects on fetal condition at birth or in the early puerperium were seen in association with the use of oxytocin. CONCLUSIONS--The use of an oxytocin infusion may reduce the high rate of operative delivery associated with epidural analgesia provided that the fetal occiput is in an anterior position at the onset of the second stage of labour but within the dose range studied does not seem to correct malposition of the fetal occiput.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients admitted with hypernatraemic dehydration from a large hospital for mentally and physically handicapped patients (hospital A) to a district general hospital between 1986 and 1988. In 1986 the hydration and nutritional state of a random sample of patients from hospital A was compared with a random sample of patients from a small hospital for the physically and mentally handicapped (hospital B) and with control groups from the community. The hydration of the patients from hospital A examined in 1986 was reassessed in 1988. PATIENTS--12 Patients were admitted from hospital A to the district general hospital during 1986-8 (seven women, five men; age range 29-82). In 1986, 72 patients were randomly selected for the assessment of hydration and nutritional state from hospital A, 33 who required help with feeding and 39 who could feed independently. Fifty patients were similarly selected from hospital B, half of them requiring help with feeding. In 1988 the hydration state of 60 of the 72 patients from hospital was reassessed. Control values were taken from two published studies. INTERVENTIONS--In 1987 nursing staff in hospital A were asked to provide between 2.5 and 3.0 litres of fluid daily for all patients. The use of hypertonic enemas was discontinued, and the ratio of staff to patients was increased. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum concentrations of urea and electrolytes (hydration) and body mass index (nutritional state). RESULTS--Of the 10 patients admitted with hypernatraemic dehydration from hospital A to the district general hospital in 1986, four died of intercurrent infection. No patients were admitted from hospital B with hypernatraemic dehydration during the same time. In 1986 the hydration and nutritional state of patients in hospital A were inferior to those in patients from hospital B and control subjects from the community (serum urea concentrations were 6.1 (SD 1.8) mmol/l v 5.5 (1.9) and 5.6 (0.4) mmol/l, respectively) 50% (36/72) of patients in hospital A had a body mass index less than or equal to 20 compared with 34% (17/50) of patients from hospital B and 12% (1141/9434) of control subjects). After the initiation of the preventive programme only one patient was admitted with hypernatraemic dehydration in each of the years 1987 and 1988. The mean serum urea concentration of the 60 patients who were reassessed in 1988 fell significantly between 1986 and 1988 from 6.1 (SD 1.8) mmol/l to 5.7 (2.1) mmol/l, the value in a control group matched for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS--Hypernatraemic dehydration, subclinical underhydration, and undernutrition were common in a large hospital for the mentally and physically handicapped. The problem of hypernatraemic dehydration was successfully dealt with by the hospital management team. Similar problems may be encountered in hospitals for patients who are mentally and physically handicapped and mentally ill, including psychogeriatric units.\r"

The cohort was followed up in the Swedish cancer register to identify cases of breast cancer diagnosed more than five years after the abortion until the end of 1984. The number of observed cases of breast cancer was 65 compared with an expected number of 84.5, estimated from the contemporary Swedish population with due consideration to age, giving a relative risk of 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.99). Contrary to most earlier reports, this study did not indicate any overall increased risk of breast cancer after an induced abortion in the first trimester in young women.\r"

It was also shown that published guidelines have made little impact. It is suggested that issuing more guidelines will be of limited use.

RESULTS--Fully completed pairs of questionnaires were available for 100 patients, 58 of whom were aged below 50. Most of the barium meal reports (64) were to confirm the clinical diagnosis; only 22 were to exclude serious disease. Ninety nine patients were already receiving treatment, with 39 taking an H2 receptor antagonist. Fifty eight barium meal examinations showed abnormalities (31 major abnormalities); there were no cancers and in only 18 patients was the working diagnosis changed as a result of the findings. Although the barium meal result increased management confidence (63 patients) and allayed patients' anxiety (46), changes in management attributed directly to the examination occurred in only 22 patients. Management changes were minor, usually comprising interchange of antacids and H2 receptor antagonists. CONCLUSIONS--Young patients (aged below 50) with dyspepsia are still being overinvestigated. Although barium meal examination improves diagnostic confidence and allays patients' anxiety, fully utilising communication skills at the initial consultation might allay anxiety more economically.\r"

DESIGN--Non-randomised cohort study of 17,032 women followed up on an annual basis for an average of nearly 16 years. SETTING--17 Family planning clinics in England and Scotland. SUBJECTS--Women recruited during 1968-74. At the time of recruitment each woman was aged 25-39, married, a white British subject, willing to participate, and either a current user of oral contraceptives or a current user of a diaphragm or intrauterine device (without previous exposure to the pill). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Overall mortality and cause specific mortality. RESULTS--238 Deaths occurred during the follow up period. The main analyses concerned women entering the study while using either oral contraceptives or a diaphragm or intrauterine device. The overall relative risk of death in the oral contraceptive users was 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.2). Though the numbers of deaths were small in most individual disease categories, the trends observed were generally consistent with findings in other reports. Thus the relative risk of death in the oral contraceptive users was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 230) for cancer of the cervix, 3.3 (95% confidence interval 0.9 to 17.9) for ischaemic heart disease, and 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.2) for ovarian cancer. There was a linear trend in the death rates from cervical cancer and ovarian cancer (in opposite directions) with total duration of oral contraceptive use. Death rates from breast cancer (relative risk 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.4) and suicide and probable suicide (relative risk 1.1; 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 3.6) were much the same in the two contraceptive groups. In 1981 the relative risk of death in oral contraceptive users from circulatory diseases as a group was reported to be 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.3 to 7.7) in the Royal College of General Practitioners oral contraception study. The corresponding relative risk in this study was only 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.0). CONCLUSIONS--These findings contain no significant evidence of any overall effect of oral contraceptive use on mortality. None the less, only small numbers of deaths occurred during the study period and a significant adverse (or beneficial) overall effect might emerge in the future. Interestingly, the mortality from circulatory disease associated with oral contraceptive use was substantially less than that found in the Royal College of General Practitioners study.\r"

SETTING--Primary schools in Guardiagrele and Francavilla in the Abruzzi region in central Italy. SUBJECTS--1615 Children aged 6-13 years were categorised according to whether they snored often; occasionally apart from with colds; only with colds; or never. RESULTS--118 Children were habitual snorers and 137 were reported to snore apart from when they had colds. Never snorers (n = 822) were significantly older than children in other categories. Snoring was significantly associated with rhinitis, production of cough and sputum, previous tonsillectomy, and passive parental smoking. Of the habitual snorers, 82 were exposed to passive smoking. The prevalence of habitual snoring increased significantly with the number of cigarettes smoked by parents (from 5.5% in never smoking [corrected] households to 8.8% in heavy smoking households). CONCLUSIONS--Snoring is quite common in children. The dose-effect relation of smoking and snoring shown in this study adds weight to a further adverse effect of parental smoking on children's health.\r"

DESIGN--Postal questionnaire and interview. SETTING--Leukaemia unit of oncology hospital. PATIENTS--Consecutive series of 46 English speaking women who had developed ovarian failure after total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation as treatment for leukaemia. RESULTS--Of the 36 responders, 33 reported some symptoms, vaginal dryness being the most common (29). This profoundly affected sexual function. Although 22 women had had sexual intercourse within six months after treatment, 16 were less interested in and 18 experienced difficulties with sexual intercourse. Anxieties about sterility, femininity, and appearance were common and reduced self confidence. Almost half reported that they had changed their social habits and restricted their social activities. Treatment seemed effective in abolishing symptoms in 24 women, but vaginal dryness remained a problem in three. Two women failed to respond and intercourse remained impossible. CONCLUSIONS--Such patients are vulnerable and access to gynaecologists and endocrinologists soon after treatment would be valuable. The optimal treatment regimen and the long term benefits of treatment have yet to be established.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the relation between body mass index and mortality in middle aged British men. DESIGN--Men who were recruited for the British Regional Heart Study were followed up for a mean of nine years. SETTING--General practices in 24 British towns. SUBJECTS--7735 Men aged 40-59 years selected from the age-sex registers of one group practice in each of the 24 towns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. RESULTS--660 Of the men died. There was a U-shaped relation between body mass index and total mortality. Very lean men (less than 20 kg/m2) had by far the highest mortality followed by lean men (20-22 kg/m2) and obese men (greater than or equal to 28 kg/m2). The high mortality in lean and very lean men was due largely to non-cardiovascular causes, particularly lung cancer and respiratory disease, which are associated with cigarette smoking. In obese men deaths were more likely to be due to cardiovascular causes. There was a strong inverse association between body weight and cigarette smoking. When the pattern of mortality was examined by age, smoking habits, and pre-existing smoking related disease both very lean men and obese men consistently had an increased mortality. The U-shaped relation was most prominent in men in the oldest age group (55-59). Current smokers had a higher mortality than former smokers at virtually all values of body mass index. An increased mortality in lean men was seen only in current smokers and in men with smoking related disease. Among men who had never smoked, lean men had the lowest total mortality, thereafter mortality increased with increasing body mass index (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--This study provides strong evidence of the impact of cigarette smoking on body weight and mortality and strongly suggests that the benefits of giving up smoking are far greater than the problems associated with the increase in weight that may occur.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the attitudes of patients discharged from hospital and their general practitioners to a new information card giving details about admission, diagnosis, and treatment and to assess the completeness of the information on the card. DESIGN--Consecutive patients discharged from the care of three consultant physicians over 16 weeks. SETTING--One general medical ward in a large teaching hospital. PATIENTS--A total of 275 consecutive discharges of 258 patients were studied. The mean age of patients was 60 years and mean duration of admission five days. INTERVENTION--At discharge from the ward all study patients received an information card and a copy of the card in the form of an interim discharge letter to be delivered to their general practitioner. Patients and general practitioners were asked to complete a questionnaire giving their views on the legibility, helpfulness, quality, and quantity of the information they received. Copies of all the information cards were scrutinised for completeness. MAIN RESULTS--The results were based on 208 (76%) forms returned by patients and 214 (78%) forms returned by general practitioners. Information was considered very helpful or quite helpful according to 170 (83%) forms from patients and 197 (92%) forms from general practitioners; sufficient information was provided according to 160 and 182 forms. Most patients and nearly all general practitioners thought it was a good idea to provide this information for patients at discharge. According to 125 forms from patients and 188 from general practitioners the information card was very easy or quite easy to read; 155 patients had read it at least twice and 149 were likely to refer to it again. OTHER RESULTS--The written information about the patient, the diagnosis, and what the patient had been told was generally well completed, although the date of discharge was omitted from 42 (15%) cards. Details of drugs prescribed at discharge were generally thorough. CONCLUSIONS--Giving an information card to all patients at discharge was feasible and favoured by most patients and their general practitioners. Having made minor changes in design, we think that we have produced an information card that is a convenient size and will improve communication between patients, their general practitioners, and hospital doctors. We now issue this card routinely to all patients discharged from our ward and hope that it might be widely adopted.\r"

SETTING--Urology departments in two hospitals. PATIENTS--815 Patients presenting as emergency admissions with urinary retention and requiring immediate decompression of the bladder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Calendar date of each admission to determine circadian, monthly, and seasonal periodicity. RESULTS--No association was found between urinary retention and circadian, monthly, or seasonal rhythms. A significantly higher (p less than 0.001) incidence of urinary retention was observed during the new moon in comparison with other phases of the lunar cycle. CONCLUSIONS--Urinary retention is periodic in nature. This should be considered when the workload of a specialist urological department is organised.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the relations between breast feeding and infant illness in the first two years of life with particular reference to gastrointestinal disease. DESIGN--Prospective observational study of mothers and babies followed up for 24 months after birth. SETTING--Community setting in Dundee. PATIENTS--750 pairs of mothers and infants, 76 of whom were excluded because the babies were preterm (less than 38 weeks), low birth weight (less than 2500 g), or treated in special care for more than 48 hours. Of the remaining cohort of 674, 618 were followed up for two years. INTERVENTIONS--Detailed observations of infant feeding and illness were made at two weeks, and one, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months by health visitors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The prevalence of gastrointestinal disease in infants during follow up. RESULTS--After confounding variables were corrected for babies who were breast fed for 13 weeks or more (227) had significantly less gastrointestinal illness than those who were bottle fed from birth (267) at ages 0-13 weeks (p less than 0.01; 95% confidence interval for reduction in incidence 6.6% to 16.8%), 14-26 weeks (p less than 0.01), 27-39 weeks (p less than 0.05), and 40-52 weeks (p less than 0.05). This reduction in illness was found whether or not supplements were introduced before 13 weeks, was maintained beyond the period of breast feeding itself, and was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of hospital admission. By contrast, babies who were breast fed for less than 13 weeks (180) had rates of gastrointestinal illness similar to those observed in bottle fed babies. Smaller reductions in the rates of respiratory illness were observed at ages 0-13 and 40-52 weeks (p less than 0.05) in babies who were breast fed for more than 13 weeks. There was no consistent protective effect of breast feeding against ear, eye, mouth, or skin infections, infantile colic, eczema, or nappy rash. CONCLUSION--Breast feeding during the first 13 weeks of life confers protection against gastrointestinal illness that persists beyond the period of breast feeding itself.\r"

DESIGN--Re-evaluation of symptoms in patients admitted consecutively with suspected hypoglycaemia followed by a case-control study. SETTING--The Steno Memorial Hospital in Gentofte, Denmark, which specialises in the diagnosis and treatment of and research on endocrine disorders, including hypoglycaemia. PATIENTS--21 Subjects admitted consecutively with hypoglycaemic symptoms that were relieved by eating in whom insulinoma and other organic disorders presenting with hypoglycaemia had been ruled out. Twelve of these subjects with persistent symptoms entered the case-control study, as did a matched control group. INTERVENTIONS--Four days of monitoring blood glucose concentrations at home, six daily samples being taken in fixed relation to meals by the finger prick method. Extra samples were taken when symptoms occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin concentration, and within subject variation in measured values. RESULTS--After one to three years of observation 19 of the 21 subjects still had symptoms. Six out of 12 subjects experienced hypoglycaemic symptoms during the controlled study. Blood glucose concentration ranged from 3.7 mmol/l to 7.5 mmol/l during these episodes. Changes in blood glucose concentration, mean blood glucose concentrations at each time point, within subject variation in the measured values, and glycated haemoglobin concentration were not significantly different in all patients compared with the control subjects and in patients with symptoms during the study compared with controls. CONCLUSION--Hypoglycaemic symptoms during everyday life in apparently healthy subjects are persistent but are not related to chemical hypoglycaemia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To establish whether a single preoperative dose of cefotaxime plus metronidazole was as effective as a standard three dose regimen of cefuroxime plus metronidazole in preventing wound infection after colorectal surgery. DESIGN--Prospective randomised allocation to one of two prophylactic antibiotic regimens in a parallel group trial. Group sequential analyses of each 250 patients were performed. SETTING--14 District general and teaching hospitals. PATIENTS--1018 Adults having colorectal operations were randomised, of whom 943 were evaluated. Demographic features, conditions requiring surgery, and operative procedures were similar in the two groups. Most patients had surgery for carcinoma of the colon or rectum. INTERVENTIONS--Group 1 received cefotaxime 1 g intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously preoperatively. Group 2 received cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously preoperatively, followed by cefuroxime 750 mg intravenously plus metronidazole 500 mg intravenously eight hours and 16 hours postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Development of surgical wound infection (as evidenced by the presence of pus), death, or discharge from hospital. RESULTS--Wound condition was scored on a five point scale on alternate days until discharge or for up to 20 days postoperatively. Wound infection rates were: group 1, 32/453 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 9.4%); group 2, 33/454 (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 4.9% to 9.6%). Death rates (group 1: 26/470 (5.5%); group 2: 31/471 (6.6%], the incidence of postoperative complications, the median duration of hospital stay (12 days), and antibiotic tolerance were all similar in the two groups. Pooled data from groups 1 and 2 showed that wound infections were more frequent when minor faecal contamination had occurred at operation and when the duration of operation exceeded 90 minutes (greater than 90 min 11.2% of cases; less than 90 min 4.8%) and were associated with an extended hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS--A single preoperative dose of cefotaxime plus metronidazole is an efficacious as a three dose regimen of cefuroxime plus metronidazole in preventing wound infection after colorectal surgery and has practical advantages in eliminating the need for postoperative antibiotics.\r"

Sixty three of 86 respondents recommended cholera vaccination when it would probably have been unnecessary. A review of common sources of information on cholera vaccination showed that general practitioners are given confusing or inappropriate advice. General practitioners should be educated about when cholera vaccination is necessary; alternatively, the vaccine should be available only through special centres.\r"

Intervention comprised feedback on prescribing habits, peer comparison, and information on drugs. Aspects of prescribing that were not subjected to intervention did not alter. In the year in which intervention occurred generic prescribing rose by 50%; inappropriate prescribing and overall use of third generation cephalosporins fell; and compliance with the recommended list of drugs was good. Overall, drug costs remained static, compared with a projected increase of 0.25 m pounds; in a comparative control hospital drug costs rose by 18%. During the next year, when no form of intervention took place, previous gains were eroded and drug costs rose. Continuous intervention, review, and feedback are required if a formulary is to continue to achieve its objectives.\r"

These include the use of digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasound, prostatic acid phosphatase, the Biopty gun, and cell ploidy, as well as the diagnosis of premalignant lesions of the prostate, such as prostatic dysplasia or, more appropriately, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. All of these innovations may enhance our ability to diagnose and follow patients with early prostate cancer. Full documentation and evaluation of long-term (15 to 20 years) follow-up, however, are needed to determine whether these new techniques will make a difference in the ultimate morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer in the United States. In the meantime, however, the use of these new diagnostic tools should not be avoided. We must advance with technology, and as the technologies grow and develop we should increase our understanding about the utility of each of these new tests and combine them with the older standard tests that have served us well for many years.\r"

  ".U": "90123945\r", 
  ".W": "Transrectal ultrasound allows tissue characterization of normal and abnormal internal anatomy of the prostate and therefore provides valuable information for the study of prostate cancer. In an early-detection program setting, the hypoechoic lesion proved to be twice as sensitive as a palpable abnormality in predicting the presence of cancer; for every two cancers detected by transrectal ultrasound, one was detected by digital rectal examination. When the presence of a hypoechoic lesion was the criterion for biopsy in a clinical setting, 41 percent proved to be cancer. Sixty-eight percent of these cancers were palpable; thus, for every four cancers detected by transrectal ultrasound, three were detected by digital rectal examination. Hence, in our diagnostic settings, transrectal ultrasound is more sensitive than digital rectal examination. Because transrectal ultrasound can measure tumor size and offer information regarding tumor spread, we recommend that transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy be performed first on all palpable lesions. Up to 50 percent of negative biopsies guided by palpation have subsequently proved to be cancer with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. If transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of a palpable lesion does not reveal cancer, however, a biopsy guided by palpation should be performed. Strategic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for staging should be performed to obtain tissue from areas where microscopic extracapsular tumor extension is likely to be present. Based on presently available evidence, broader implementation and evaluation of transrectal ultrasound, a tool to be complemented by digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen, is advocated for the early detection of prostate cancer. It is hoped that the use of transrectal ultrasound will lead to increased survival, with good quality of life, in a cost-effective manner, for men at increasing risk from prostate cancer in the aging national population.\r"

If we could determine a subset of individuals with PIN, an enriched population on which to base screening studies would emerge. In this regard the observation that PIN may be associated with elevation of the serum PSA is particularly intriguing. Considerable interest exists for early detection of prostate cancer. The high morbidity and mortality associated with this tumor coupled with the late stage at presentation by conventional means underscore the justification for such enthusiasm. However, the wisdom of screening for a cancer for which the mortality is far less than the histologic incidence remains to be proven. In the final analysis, the question is not whether we can detect more carcinoma, but rather whether we can significantly decrease patient morbidity and mortality. Until prospective randomized clinical trials demonstrate the effectiveness of early detection programs for carcinoma of the prostate, it is difficult to recommend such screening to the general public.\r"

  ".U": "90124144\r", 
  ".W": "Small cell lung cancer patients who failed primary systemic therapy or who failed after response were randomly assigned to salvage treatment with etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) or bis-chloro-ethylnitrosourea, thiotepa, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide (BTOC). Good risk patients were those who had tolerated prior chemotherapy well, those who had not had prior radiation therapy, and those who were 65 years of age or younger. Patients with a history of poor tolerance, prior radiation therapy, or those who were older than 65 years of age were classified as poor risk. Forty-five patients were randomized to the BTOC regimen and 58 to the VP-16/CDDP regimen. The overall remission rate was 13% (13 of 103 patients). Good risk patients treated with the BTOC regimen had a remission rate of 27% (three of 11 patients), which was the same rate as patients treated with the VP-16/CDDP regimen (three of 11 patients). Poor risk patients had remission rates of 9% (three of 34 patients) with the BTOC regimen and 9% (four of 47 patients) with the VP-16/CDDP regimen. The median survival time from the start of therapy was 16 weeks for all patients. BTOC good risk patients had a median survival time of 10 weeks, as compared with 14 weeks for poor risk patients. VP-16/CDDP good risk patients had a median survival time of 35 weeks, as compared with 12 weeks for poor risk patients. Although based on small numbers, the advantage in survival time for good risk patients treated with VP-16/CDDP over those treated with BTOC is statistically significant. Prior exposure to VP-16 did not influence the outcome of patients treated with VP-16/CDDP. Both regimens produced moderate toxicity, but were generally well tolerated. It was concluded that VP-16/CDDP may be a useful salvage treatment for good risk patients, despite its limited remission rate. Also, it was found that BTOC has no value for patients in this setting and that neither regimen helps patients who are poor risk.\r"

This study demonstrated that, the HLA-DR+ and IL-2R+ antigens are selectively expressed on majority of the CD4+ T-lymphocytes of patients with SCB, whereas, these antigens are expressed almost equally on both CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes of patients with SB and SCP. Expressions of HLA-DR+ and IL-2R+ antigens in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and a depressed response of this T-cell subset to phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A stimulations seems to be the characteristic feature of these patients with SCB. In addition, the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) and allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was depressed in patients with SCB. However, patients with SCP demonstrated a normal MLR, even though the AMLR was highly depressed. The immunoregulatory role of the HLA-DR+, IL-2R+, CD4+ helper/inducer T-lymphocytes, and the AMLR and MLR abnormalities we have identified in patients with SCB may be important and could play a role in the pathobiology of these diseases in humans.\r"

Early recognition and treatment of occult fractures will reduce lay-off time and decrease the likelihood of prolonged impairment of performance. The appropriate treatment of radiographically obvious fractures will have a similar effect. The key to making an early diagnosis is the recognition of characteristic patterns on physical examination and the aggressive investigation of persistent foot pain in the athlete, whether it follows an injury or not. When a fracture is not apparent on routine radiographs, special diagnostic techniques, particularly technetium bone scanning, can effectively screen for bony injury. In the competitive athlete there is no reason to adopt a \"wait-and-see\" attitude. The approach in treating these injuries in athletes should be similarly definitive. If continued participation will delay healing or resolution of the symptoms, it should not be tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "In awake normocapnic rats, the density of the total and of the perfused capillary network was determined in 10 brain areas. The density of perfused capillaries was measured by using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) globulin or Evans blue as intravenous marker and by fluorescent microscopy. The density of morphologically existing capillaries was determined according to either the histochemical alkaline phosphatase method or a newly developed immunohistochemical fluorescent method that allows marking of the capillary wall constituent fibronectin with a primary antibody directed against fibronectin. This antibody is made visible by a second FITC-coupled antibody (indirect immunofluorescence). Comparison of perfused and existing capillary counts revealed high congruence when fluorescent results were compared. In contrast, the alkaline phosphatase technique yielded capillary counts that were consistently 30% lower than the fibronectin and the FITC globulin counts. The identity of the perfused and the morphologically existing capillary network could be confirmed by a newly developed double-staining technique. First, the perfused capillaries were quantified by intravascular Evans blue. Then, the existing capillaries were relocated in the same measuring field by the fibronectin technique. Such double staining resulted in identical capillary counts in 97% of all cases. The following conclusions have been reached: 1) Fluorescent methods show a perfusion of virtually all capillaries in the brain of the awake normocapnic rat. 2) The alkaline phosphatase technique appears to underestimate the capillary density in the rat brain.\r"

  ".W": "We injected neonatal rats with nerve growth factor, the antiserum to nerve growth factor, or placebo for the first 10 days of life. Our goal was to determine the relation between sympathetic innervation of the developing heart, the electrocardiographic expression of cardiac rhythm, and the response of the heart to alpha-adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine. We were especially interested in the latter area because of the prior demonstration in isolated cell systems of sympathetic neural modulation of a 41-kDa GTP regulatory protein and alpha-adrenergic responsiveness. Ten- to 11-day-old rats treated with nerve growth factor had more complete sympathetic innervation, faster heart rates, and higher levels of the 41-kDa protein than the placebo group. Electrophysiological studies were performed on isolated ventricular septa superfused with Tyrode's solution at 37.0 degrees-37.5 degrees C. The electrophysiological response of septa to 10(-9) and 10(-8) M phenylephrine from the 10-11-day-old nerve growth factor group was comparable with that of 3-week-old control animals. In contrast, 10-11-day-old antiserum-treated rats had an abnormal innervation pattern, lower levels of the 41-kDa protein, and a more immature electrophysiological response to alpha-adrenergic stimulation than the placebo group. In addition, antiserum-treated rats had an abnormally prolonged electrocardiographic QT interval. Our results demonstrate for the first time in intact animals a direct link between sympathetic innervation and alpha-adrenergic receptor-effector coupling as well as the dependence on innervation of the modulation of impulse initiation by alpha-agonists. This sequence of developmental events may be important not only in the regulation of normal cardiac rhythm but also in the expression of certain pathological entities such as the congenital long QT syndrome and the sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Glibenclamide, one of the antidiabetic sulfonylureas, is known to block ATP-dependent K+ channels. We used this drug to determine to what extent K+ loss from acutely ischemic myocardium is mediated via these channels. We also investigated whether glibenclamide would influence ischemic arrhythmias. Isolated rat hearts rendered globally ischemic showed no correlation between early lactate and K+ efflux rates. Cumulative K+ loss during 11 minutes of global ischemia (0.5 ml min-1 g-1) was reduced, from 3.2 +/- 0.3 to 2.5 +/- 0.1 mueq/g (p less than 0.025) by 1 microM glibenclamide and from 3.3 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.2 mueq/g (p less than 0.005) by 10 microM glibenclamide, while lactate efflux was unaltered by the drug. Glibenclamide also exhibited potent antifibrillatory activity, abolishing irreversible ventricular fibrillation during regional ischemia (0/6 vs. 5/6 controls; p less than 0.02) and during global ischemia (0/7 vs. 9/9 controls; p less than 0.01). Heart rate, coronary flow rate, peak systolic pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption were unaltered by the drug (1 microM). Similarly, glibenclamide (1 microM) did not alter myocardial ATP, phosphocreatine or lactate content, or glucose utilization. Ventricular fibrillation threshold during normoxia was also unaltered by glibenclamide (1 microM). We conclude that K+ loss during acute myocardial ischemia is mediated partly by ATP-dependent K+ channels, and not by a tightly coupled co-efflux with anionic lactate.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the pathways for low density lipoprotein (LDL) transport across an endothelial barrier in individually perfused microvessels before and after an increase in permeability. The divalent cation ionophore A23187 (5 microM) was used to increase microvessel permeability. LDL permeability coefficients (PsLDL) were measured using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. In the control state, PsLDL measured after 10-23 minutes of accumulation of fluorescent-labeled LDL outside the microvessel wall was 4.8 x 10(-8) cm/sec. The transvascular vesicular exchange of approximately 50 vesicles/sec would account for the measured flux. The flux of LDL across the microvessel wall increased as much as 170-fold at the peak of the permeability increase (2-4 minutes after ionophore infusion). Permeability returned toward control values 10 minutes after ionophore infusion but remained elevated for as long as ionophore was present in the perfusate. The effective PsLDL was similar in magnitude to the Ps for fluorescent-labeled dextran (MW 20,000) when permeability was increased. To investigate the nature of pathways for LDL in the high-permeability state, PsLDL was measured at a series of microvessel pressures. LDL transport increased as microvessel pressure increased, demonstrating coupling of LDL flux to transvascular water flow. Solvent drag accounted for more than 95% of the increased flux of LDL in the period 2-10 minutes after permeability increased. Our results conform to the hypothesis that porous pathways between adjacent endothelial cells contribute to LDL transport across an endothelial barrier when permeability is increased.\r"

TXA2 was given in a 5 micrograms/kg bolus followed by a steady infusion of 1 micrograms/kg/min to three groups of lungs: group 1, n = 4, with low vasomotor tone; group 2, n = 8, with moderate vasomotor tone; and group 3, n = 7, with moderate vasomotor tone and high venous intraluminal pressures. Group 3 lungs were reverse-perfused to obtain high venous pressures. ANP was given as two 10 micrograms/kg bolus injections, 5 minutes apart, to three groups of lungs: group 4, n = 4, with low vasomotor tone; group 5, n = 5, with moderate vasomotor tone; and group 6, n = 8, with high vasomotor tone. Group 6 lungs were vasoconstricted with TXA2 infusion. In all lungs, we measured blood flow and pressures in the pulmonary artery and left atrium and partitioned the venous segment by measuring pressures in 20-80-microns venules by micropuncture. We found that the venous constrictor response to TXA2 was greatest in lungs with moderate basal vasomotor tone and low venous intraluminal pressures. In lungs with low vasomotor tone or high venous intraluminal pressures, the venous response to TXA2 was attenuated. The vasodilator response to ANP was negligible in lungs with low vasomotor tone, probably because they were already maximally vasodilated, but similar in lungs with moderate and high vasomotor tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of this seemingly expensive new technology with data obtained from the 1984 Medicare data base, the medical literature, Medicare carriers, individual pharmacies and hospitals, and expert opinion. Analyzing combinations of principal and secondary discharge diagnoses across 18 diagnosis-related groups, we estimated the cost of hospitalization for a comparison group of patients. Hospitalization costs for the defibrillator group were obtained from reported empirical data. Rehospitalization rates and other health-care use estimates were solicited from an expert panel of physicians, and mortality rates for both groups were obtained from the literature. Using a decision-analytic model, we estimated that the net cost effectiveness of the defibrillator, when used in the high-risk patient, is approximately $17,100 per life-year saved, with sensitivity analyses suggesting that the true value lies between $15,000 and $25,000. This estimate is well within the range that is currently accepted by the US medical care system for other life-saving interventions. We also estimated the cost effectiveness of the defibrillator in a 1991 scenario to be $7,400 per life-year saved, when the device would have greater longevity, would be programmable, and would not require a thoracotomy. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the true value lies between a value that is cost saving (less expensive than pharmacologic therapy) and $19,600 per life-year saved.\r"

  ".W": "In animals, acetylcholine dilates normal arteries and produces vasoconstriction in the presence of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or atherosclerosis, reflecting endothelial cell dysfunction. In patients with angiographically smooth coronary arteries, acetylcholine has been reported to produce both vasodilation and constriction. To test the hypothesis that the acetylcholine response relates to risk factors for coronary artery disease, acetylcholine 10(-8) to 10(-6) M was infused into the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery, and diameter changes were assessed with quantitative angiography in 34 patients with angiographically smooth coronary arteries. The acetylcholine response ranged from +37% (dilation) to -53% (constriction) at the peak acetylcholine dose. All coronary arteries dilated in response to nitroglycerin (26 +/- 17%), suggesting an abnormality of endothelial function in the patients with a constrictor response to acetylcholine. By multiple stepwise regression analysis, serum cholesterol (p less than 0.01), male gender (p less than 0.001), family history (p less than 0.05), age (p less than 0.05), cholesterol level (p less than 0.01), and total number of risk factors (p less than 0.0001) were independently associated with the acetylcholine response. Thus, coronary risk factors are associated with loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. The development of vasoconstriction is likely to be an abnormality of endothelial function that precedes atherosclerosis or an early marker of atherosclerosis not detectable by angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary artery rethrombosis can complicate initially effective thrombolytic therapy. Platelets interacting with injured vascular endothelium in a region along the coronary artery with reduced luminal cross-sectional area contribute to rethrombosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of the F(ab')2 fragment of the murine monoclonal antibody 7E3 [7E3 F(ab')2] to prevent rethrombosis after intracoronary clot lysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in an experimental model. The 7E3 F(ab')2 binds to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex (GPIIb/IIIa), thereby preventing platelet-fibrinogen interaction and intravascular thrombus formation. Experimental coronary artery thrombosis was produced in the anesthetized dog by application of direct anodal current to the intimal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery in the region of an external stenosis. Lysis of the established intracoronary thrombus was achieved with the intravenous administration of rt-PA (25 mg) after which the animals were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (n = 10) served as the control, receiving the saline diluent, and group 2 (n = 9) received 7E3 F(ab')2, given as a single intravenous injection (0.8 mg/kg). The times required for occlusive thrombus formation, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis, and rethrombosis (if it occurred) were similar in the animals treated with saline and those treated with 7E3 F(ab')2. The initial left circumflex coronary artery blood flow was similar in both groups but decreased to a negligible level in group 1. In group 2, left circumflex coronary artery blood flow declined modestly (24 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 ml/min). Rethrombosis occurred in all animals in group 1 but in only two of nine animals in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Oscillations in coronary blood flow preceded rethrombosis in group 1, whereas 7E3 F(ab')2 stabilized left circumflex coronary artery blood flow patterns during the course of teh experimental protocol (5.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4 oscillations, respectively; p less than 0.05). Thrombus mass recovered from the left circumflex coronary artery at the conclusion of each experiment was greater in group 1 as compared with group 2 (7.0 +/- 2.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 mg, respectively; p less than 0.05). The area of left ventricle at risk for infarction was similar in both groups but infarct size, infarction/at risk assessed histochemically, was larger in group 1 than group 2 (35 +/- 9% vs. 6 +/- 4%, respectively; p less than 0.05).

Furthermore, there were only weak correlations between plasma renin activity and plasma norepinephrine and hemodynamic measurements, age, and renal function, indicating that activation of these systems is complex and determined by many other factors. The converting enzyme inhibitors have beneficial effects on the hemodynamic abnormalities of patients with heart failure, with reductions in arterial tone and preload as well as increases in cardiac output. Their long-term effects on markers of the renin-angiotensin system, however, and their interactions with the sympathetic nervous system and atrial natriuretic factor are less well defined.\r"

The aim of the present study was to find the lowest dosage regimen of the LMWH which would be as effective as the standard UFH regimen. The UFH regimen comprised a prime with heparinized saline, an initial intravenous bolus of 5,000 international units (IU) and an infusion of 1,500 IU/h. The three LMWH regimens comprised a LMWH-saline prime, an infusion of 750 anti-factor Xa (aXa) U/h and three different bolus doses: 1) LMWH-low: 3,000 aXa U. 2) LMWH-medium: 4,000 aXa U. 3) LMWH-high: 5,000 aXa U. With the UFH regimen, plasma heparin levels of around 1.0 IU/ml were maintained during the heparin infusion, declining to 0.71 IU/ml an hour after the infusion was terminated. The LMWH-medium regimen produced very similar plasma aXa levels. The LMWH-high regimen also produced similar plasma aXa levels: therefore, it had no advantage over the LMWH-medium regimen. The LMWH-low regimen produced significantly lower levels than the other regimens during the heparin infusion (0.81-0.85 aXa U/ml, p less than 0.025). Dialysis proceeded uneventfully at all times and plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were suppressed well with all 4 regimens (2.77-5.74 pmol/ml) but tended to rise after the infusion was switched off (5.52-8.45 pmol/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An arginine vasopressin level of 18 X 10(12) mol/l, which can be achieved physiologically, increased the sensitivity of platelets to adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate and collagen in vitro; the same concentration of arginine vasopressin caused a potentiation of the effect of catecholamines on the response of platelets to sodium arachidonate. 4. These results indicate that intraplatelet arginine vasopressin is released during aggregation and suggest that a local release of arginine vasopressin could occur after complete platelet aggregation in vivo.\r"

Mean blood pressure was reduced to the same extent in the uraemic patients as in 11 healthy subjects, with a nadir 3 min after the atrial natriuretic peptide injection at which time mean blood pressure was reduced by 13% (median) in the uraemic patients and 11% in the healthy subjects. 3. Basal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate levels were higher in the uraemic patients than in the healthy subjects, but guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate increased markedly in both groups after atrial natriuretic peptide injection. 4. Using changes in gamma-emission from blood after previous labelling of erythrocytes with 51Cr, and changes in packed cell volume, haemoglobin and erythrocyte count, a reversible shift of fluid from the intravascular phase was demonstrated in the uraemic subjects. The blood volume was maximally reduced by 6% (median) of initial blood volume at 30 min after atrial natriuretic peptide injection. 5. Correlation analyses gave no evidence of a causal relationship between the changes in mean blood pressure and changes in blood volume, angiotensin II, aldosterone or arginine vasopressin after atrial natriuretic peptide injection. 6. It is concluded that a pharmacological dose of atrial natriuretic peptide reduces blood pressure in uraemic patients on maintenance dialysis to the same extent as in healthy subjects. The blood-pressure-reducing effect of atrial natriuretic peptide does not seem to be mediated by its diuretic effect or ability to displace fluid from plasma to the interstitial fluid compartment.\r"

The major target cells for infection are CD-4 antigen-bearing cells which include predominantly, but not exclusively, the helper T-cell subset and the monocyte/macrophage cell system. Defective cell-mediated immunity occurs in association with hypergammaglobulinemia, which is a common and early feature of HIV infection. Ability to mount specific antibody responses is often impaired and the in vitro B-cell differentiation responses to T-dependent and T-independent stimuli are depressed. Our investigations with HIV envelope proteins suggest that the viral proteins can exert both stimulatory and suppressive influences on B and T lymphocytes. In addition to the opportunistic infections, children with HIV disease frequently develop serious bacterial infections. Among the currently available immunotherapeutic strategies, iv immunoglobulin therapy has received the most attention as a means to provide antibody replacement in children with recurrent bacterial infections. This modality is likely to be most valuable as adjunctive therapy in treatment protocols directed at HIV and its disease complications.\r"

Feeding by the iv route or giving crystalline amino acids instead of intact protein does not prevent atrophy of the intestine, nor does it prevent the hypermetabolic response. Optimal diets for nutritional support of burn patients contain 20% of energy from whey protein, 2% from arginine, 0.5% from cysteine, and 0.5% from histidine. Lipids comprise 15% of nonprotein calories with 50% fish oil (high in omega-3 fatty acids) and 50% safflower oil (high in linoleic acid). In a prospective clinical study, administration of this new diet was found to reduce wound infection (p less than .03), shorten hospital stay (p less than .02), and reduce death (p less than .06) when compared to other standard enteral formulations.\r"

  ".W": "The normal immune system has local and systemic components which are influenced by a variety of alterations. Impaired host immunity is associated with neoplasia, protein calorie malnutrition, and the administration of immunosuppressive drugs. It is well accepted that protein calorie malnutrition impairs host immunity with particular detrimental effects on the T-cell system, resulting in increased opportunistic infection and increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Individual nutrient substrates may also have a major influence on the immune system. Individual amino acids are often described as essential, based on requirements for optimal growth and maintenance of positive N balance. Arginine has been demonstrated to be essential to the traumatized host and may have tissue-specific properties which influence components of the immune system. Thus, arginine may be of value in clinical situations where the immune system is compromised. In a series of experiments in normal animals, arginine was demonstrated to enhance cellular immune mechanisms, in particular T-cell function. It also has a marked immunopreserving effect in the face of immunosuppression induced by protein malnutrition and increases in tumor burden. In postoperative surgical patients, arginine supplementation results in enhanced T-lymphocyte response and augmented T-helper cell numbers, with a rapid return to normal of T-cell function postoperatively compared with control patients. These data suggest that arginine supplementation may enhance or preserve immune function in high-risk surgical patients and theoretically improve the host's capacity to resist infection.\r"

Previous short-term studies show equivalent arterial PO2, 55 to 60 percent oxygen savings, and no reduction of nasal humidity when compared with continuous flow nasal cannula oxygen. This study compares the clinical efficacy of pulse flow and continuous flow oxygen in 100 patients recently hospitalized for diseases requiring O2 therapy. In an unblinded crossover design, pulse and continuous O2 were administered alternately during four 51/2-hour periods. Oxygen saturation was monitored continuously during the 23-hour study. Mean SaO2 on pulse flow (95.6 +/- 2.7 percent) was clinically the same as continuous flow (95.3 +/- 2.6 percent). Mean SaO2 on pulse flow during the 30 minutes before or after each crossover (95.5 +/- 3.3 percent) was similar to continuous flow during the 30 minutes near crossover (95.3 +/- 3.1 percent). It is concluded that the two delivery systems produce similar levels of SaO2 over the course of a day and night. Analysis of potential cost savings achieved by use of the device for a 350-bed hospital suggests a savings of about $50,000 yearly when accompanied by termination of oxygen humidification.\r"

  ".W": "To examine how insulin secretory ability is modified by strict glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects, basal and/or prandial insulin was supplemented for 4 wk in 24 diabetic subjects who were secondary failures to sulfonylurea treatment. One intermediate-acting insulin injection a day (n = 7) failed to suppress the rise in plasma C-peptide after meals and did not improve plasma C-peptide responses during a posttreatment oral glucose challenge. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with a premeal bolus (n = 8) suppressed both fasting and meal-related rises in C-peptide and improved C-peptide response during the posttreatment oral glucose challenge. Daily insulin requirements during the 4 wk of treatment were reduced significantly by 52%. A short-acting insulin injection before each meal (n = 9) without basal supplementation suppressed the prandial rise in C-peptide and was associated with a significant reduction in daily insulin requirements during 4 wk of treatment by 28%. Diabetic subjects whose fasting and prandial hyperglycemia were less than 140 and less than 200 mg/dl, respectively, showed a significantly higher C-peptide response during oral glucose challenge after treatment than those whose insulin treatment only normalized (less than 200 mg/dl) prandial but not basal hyperglycemia (greater than 140 mg/dl). These results suggest that a short-term period of meal-related insulin treatment (which normalized prandial glycemia) increases residual beta-cell function in NIDDM subjects who failed long-term sulfonylurea administration. A basal insulin supplement alone was not effective. The effectiveness of a prandial insulin supplement may have been further improved by a combined basal and meal-related treatment program.\r"

The review failed to implicate rate of hydration, tonicity of administered fluids, rate of correction of glycemia, or use of bicarbonate. Infants and young children (less than 5 yr of age) were disproportionately represented (33%), as were new-onset patients (62%). Approximately 20% of patients were found to have localized basilar edema, hemorrhage, thromboses, or infection by computed tomography scan or on postmortem examination. The histories of 50% of the patients suggested a period of dramatic neurological change preceding respiratory arrest (RA) during which intervention might be effective. Twenty-three patients were treated for increased intracranial pressure before RA; 13 patients survived in an independent functional state, and 3 survived in a severely disabled or vegetative state. Only 3 of the remaining 46 patients survived normally: 2 were untreated and never developed RA, and 1 was given mannitol at the onset of apnea. This review supports close neurological monitoring and intervention to reduce intracranial pressure when there are definite signs of neurological compromise. However, treatment appears to be successful in only 50% of patients who give sufficient warning for such intervention, and they comprised half of the study population. Therefore, prevention of DKA remains the most important goal to avoid intracerebral complications.\r"

The object of this study was to determine whether the 5HT system is involved in the stimulation of GH secretion by alpha 2-receptor agonists. There are two parts of this study. In the first, the relationship between alpha 2-5HT systems were analyzed by determining if alpha 2-stimulated GH release is mediated by 5HT. In this model, systemically administered alpha 2-agonists [clonidine (CLON) or UK14,304] were tested against 5HT antagonists (meterogoline or cyproheptadine) or 5HT synthesis inhibitors (p-chlorophenylalanine methylester hydrochloride). In the second, sites of 5HT-GRH interaction were determined by testing the response to CLON after 5HT neurotoxin [5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT)] microinjection at specific hypothalamic nuclei. In both experiments sequential blood samples were withdrawn from silastic jugular cannulas in unanesthetized, freely moving animals. Metergoline (0.045 and 0.135 mg/kg, iv) and cyproheptadine (0.969 micrograms/kg, iv) suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the CLON (33 or 66 micrograms/kg, iv)-induced GH surge that was detected 15-30 min after injection in control animals. Both cyproheptadine (0.969 micrograms/kg, iv) and p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg, ip) effectively suppressed the UK14,304 (220 micrograms/kg, iv)-induced GH surge that occurred 15-30 min after injection in control animals. These data suggest that an intact 5HT system is required for alpha 2-stimulated GH release. 5,7-DHT neurotoxin microinjected into the midline arcuate nucleus (6 micrograms/mg,iv) or bilaterally into the ventromedial nucleus or perifornical area (4 micrograms/0.2 microliter) 5 days previously suppressed the CLON (30 micrograms/kg)-induced GH surge only in animals with arcurate nucleus lesions. To determine if the suppression was mediated by inhibition of GH-releasing hormone (GRH) or stimulation of somatostatin (SRIF), an additional experiment was conducted including 5,7-DHT arcuate nucleus-lesioned animals injected with anti-SRIF. Inasmuch as anti-SRIF failed to reverse the 5,7-DHT suppression of GH secretion, the results of this experiment suggest that GRH mediates NE-5HT-induced GH secretion. In conclusion, these data suggest that alpha 2 activation of GH secretion requires intact serotonergic terminals in the arcuate nucleus and most likely involves GRH rather than SRIF, release.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the possibility that the prepubertal hiatus in gonadotropin secretion in primates is occasioned by an endogenous opioid peptide (EOP)-dependent suppression of pulsatile GnRH release, the ability of an EOP receptor antagonist, naloxone (NAL), to elicit GnRH release was examined indirectly in the rhesus monkey. For this purpose, six castrated male monkeys, aged 18-24 months, first received an intermitten iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 micrograms/min for 3 min every h) to enhance the responsiveness of the gonadotroph to endogenous GnRH. Acute and chronic blockade of EOP receptors with single bolus injections of NAL at three doses (0.2, 2.0, and 10 mg/kg BW) and a continuous infusion of the antagonist (2 mg/h for 36 h), respectively, failed to elicit significant increments in circulating concentrations of mean LH. In addition, changes in plasma LH concentrations during a chronic intermitten iv infusion of NAL (2 mg/kg BW every 6 h for up to 16 days) were unremarkable. Unequivocal discharges of LH, however, were observed in response to small doses of GnRH (0.3 micrograms/monkey) administered iv after all modes of NAL administration. Taken together, these findings fail to provide evidence for the view that in primates, EOPs underlie the hiatus in pulsatile GnRH release, which in these species is responsible for the quiescence of the pituitary-testicular axis during the greater part of prepubertal development.\r"

Beginning on July 12 (day 1 of the experiment), 2-yr-old Rambouillet ewes were immunized four times at intervals of 20, 30, and 30 days, respectively, by im injections of the alpha-subunit each time with 100 micrograms. Blood was collected from the jugular vein as required before and after ovulation. Ovulation rates were determined, beginning on day 87, by laparotomy before estrous synchronization by means of vaginal progestagen sponges. After synchronization, ewes were examined again. The ovulation rate before estrous synchronization was over 4 times higher in immunized than control ewes [8.7 +/- (+/- SE) 1.9 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.0]. After estrous synchronization, ovulation rates in the immunized and control ewes were 6.3 +/- 2.4 and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively; this increase was accompanied by higher pre- and postovulatory FSH levels, but there was no change in the pattern of circulating LH. Furthermore, the postovulatory FSH surge persisted for longer periods of time in the immunized than control animals. These results demonstrate the potency of the human recombinant alpha-subunit as an immunogen and illustrate its specificity in suppressing the effects of endogenous inhibin. The results also point to inhibin as an important regulatory factor in controlling the ovulation rate by modulating both pre- and postovulatory FSH levels.\r"

  ".U": "90126552\r", 
  ".W": "Human thyroglobulin (TG) is unique among glycoproteins and TGs of other species in having a chondroitin sulfate chain. We studied the effects of p-nitrophenol-beta-D-xylopyranoside (PNXP), an inhibitor of chondroitin sulfate incorporation into core protein of proteoglycans, on the synthesis of human TG. Fragments of normal thyroid tissue from two patients were preincubated for 1 h with PNXP before adding [35S] sulfate and [3H]leucine. TG was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. Chondroitin ABC lyase released 38-42% of the [35S]sulfate from control TG, synthesized in the absence of inhibitor, demonstrating the presence of chondroitin sulfate units. In the samples incubated with increasing concentrations of PNXP (0.2 and 1 mM), the fraction of [35S] sulfate released by ABC lyase decreased progressively (14-23% and 8-11%, respectively). This confirms that, as in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, chondroitin sulfate synthesis in TG is initiated by the transfer of a galactose unit, by galactosyltransferase, to a xylosyl-serine in the TG peptide backbone. This step is prevented by PNXP, which is a competitive acceptor of galactose. The density of TG synthesized in the presence of PNXP was determined by CsCl equilibrium density centrifugation. [3H] leucine-labeled TG from the samples incubated with PNXP was less dense than [3H]leucine-labeled TG from the control specimen. The newly synthesized TG was less dense either because of the lack of the chondroitin sulfate chain or because further processing of the TG was impaired. To differentiate these possibilities, we treated control, [3H]leucine-labeled TG with chondroitin ABC lyase and compared its density to that of [3H] leucine-labeled TG synthesized in the presence of 1 mM PNXP. The decrease in density produced by PNXP was greater than the decrease brought about by chondroitin ABC lyase (4.3-5.2 x 10(-3) and 2.4-2.8 x 10(-3) g/cm3, respectively). Therefore, the density contributed by the chondroitin chain was insufficient to account for the entire density shift seen with PNXP. We conclude that 1) chondroitin sulfate synthesis is initiated by the transfer of a galactosyl unit to xylosyl-serine in the TG peptide backbone; and 2) inhibition of this step decreases the density of TG by preventing the addition of the chondroitin chain and interfering with the further processing of TG.\r"

There was little competition for receptor occupancy between hCG and ovine FSH (oFSH) (0.05%) and no competition between hCG and ovine PRL (less than 0.01%). No similar binding sites were detected in crude membrane preparation of heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, and lung tissues. Concentrations of uterine unoccupied binding sites (RLH) were determined for each stage of the 4-day estrous cycle. The RLH were found in all preparations of metestrus uteri (n = 10) but only in some preparations from the other stages of the estrous cycle (1 of 7 on proestrus, 3 of 4 on estrus, 5 of 7 on diestrus). The concentration of uterine RLH varied throughout the estrous cycle with highest values during the metestrus (1.50 +/- 0.15 fmol/mg protein) and lowest values during the proestrus (less than 0.2 fmol/mg protein). The affinity constant for hCG of uterine RLH remained constant during the estrous cycle (about 0.8 x 10(11) M-1) and was nearly identical to that of rat ovarian receptors. On metestrus, RLH concentration appeared to be approximately 35-fold lower in the uterus than in the ovaries when expressed per mg protein (1.50 +/- 0.15 vs. 52.83 +/- 3.61 fmol/mg protein) but only 20 times lower when expressed per organ (2.2 vs. 48.3 fmol/organ). The estrous cycle-related changes of uterine RLH concentration, together with our data establishing an in vitro influence of hCG on progesterone metabolism in rat uterus, suggest that some uterine functions could be directly regulated either by LH from the pituitary or during early pregnancy by an LH-like substance originating from the embryo.\r"

  ".W": "Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates and functionally inactivates a number of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), including the inhibitory G-protein, Gi. Once ADP-ribosylated, the subsequent duration of inactivation and fate of these proteins in cells are unknown. In the present study, therefore, we have attempted to answer some of these questions in an in vivo rat adipocyte model. Our results indicate a rather prolonged (greater than 2 weeks) inactivation of Gi, as evidenced by loss of R-phenylisopropyladenosine-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in rat adipocyte membranes after administration of the toxin in vivo. This was associated with a complete loss of pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylatable substrates on days 3 and 15, with only partial recovery by day 28 after initiation of treatment. Specific antibodies used to quantitate the levels of alpha i1- and alpha 12-subunits of alpha i indicate a 2-fold increase in the levels of these proteins by day 3, followed by a progressive decrease and subsequent recovery in these subunits to 53%, 47%, and 87% of the control value on days 15, 20, and 28, respectively. No change in the levels of alpha s was observed at all time points tested. The levels of mRNA encoding the alpha i proteins were measured using specific oligonucleotide probes to determine whether changes in the levels of these transcripts could explain the observed regulation of alpha i. At the early time point (day 3), there was no alteration in the mRNA for alpha 3, alpha i1, alpha i2, and alpha i3 in fat pads from control and treated rats. However, the levels of the alpha i1 transcript decreased slightly in the treated groups on day 15-20 by a maximum of 33% and partially recovered by day 28. No changes in the alpha i2, alpha i3, alpha s, or tubulin transcripts were observed over the same treatment period. These results provide the first evidence that ADP ribosylation of the alpha i proteins by pertussis toxin leads to significant alterations in their levels. Furthermore, alterations in the levels of alpha i proteins (except alpha i1) do not appear to result from transcriptional regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The ovarian granulosa cell has previously been shown to be a site of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I production, reception, and action. It is the purpose of this communication to explore the possibility that this cell type is also capable of hormonally-regulatable elaboration of IGF binding proteins (BPs). To this end, granulosa cells from immature, diethylstilbestrol-primed rats were cultured for up to 72 h under serum-free conditions in the absence or presence of FSH (100 ng/ml). Media conditioned by untreated granulosa cells revealed constitutively released polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitable [125I] IGF-I binding activity the daily elaboration of which proved constant throughout the 72 h experimental period. However, treatment of granulosa cells, with FSH resulted in dramatic inhibition of the accumulation of IGF-I binding activity (89% at the 100 ng/ml dose level). Systemic provision of FSH (10 micrograms/rat/day for 2 days) revealed that this gonadotropic action is not strictly an in vitro phenomenon but that it can be fully reproduced under in vivo circumstances. Western ligand blotting of SDS-PAGE-fractionated media conditioned by untreated granulosa cells revealed three IGF-BP species comprising a major band doublet (28-29 kDa) as well as a single minor band (23 kDa). Treatment with FSH virtually eliminated the 23 kDa species and substantially reduced the relative representation of the 28 and 29 kDa IGF-BP species (82 and 74% inhibition, respectively). Taken together, these observations disclose the multiplicity of granulosa cell-derived IGF-BPs and reveal the striking ability of FSH to suppress their constitutive release under both in vitro and in vivo circumstances. This FSH action is all the more noteworthy in light of the generally stimulatory effect exerted by FSH at the level of the granulosa cell. Inasmuch as FSH may be concerned with the promotion of granulosa cell development, its ability to attenuate the release of (presumptively inhibitory) IGF-BPs may enhance the access of endogenously-produced IGF-1 to its cognate cell surface receptors and hence its cellular hormonal action.\r"

Hormonal patterns and specific binding of [125I]FSH to ovaries of lactating rats that kept their pups (LRP) or were separated from their pups on day 13 postpartum (LRX) were studied on days 13-16 postpartum. In LRP rats gonadotropin levels remained low and unvarying throughout the experiment; PRL levels were high in the morning, low at 1300 h, and then surged in the afternoon. Estradiol levels were very low in LRP rats in serum as well as in ovarian homogenates, and progesterone levels decreased gradually from days 13 to 16. No changes in either receptor number or dissociation constants (Kd) were observed in [125I]FSH binding to ovaries of LRP rats. In LRX rats, LH peaked on the afternoon of day 15 (P less than 0.05). FSH decreased from morning levels on day 13 to morning levels on day 15, and then peaked at 1600 h on day 15 (p less than 0.05). PRL decreased rapidly (day 13 1600 h levels significantly lower than day 13 1100 h levels), then remained low and peaked on the afternoon of day 15 (P less than 0.05). IN LRX rats progesterone levels decreased more markedly than in LRP rats and then surged in the afternoon of day 15. Serum estradiol levels rose significantly in the morning of day 15, while ovarian homogenate estradiol titers had already risen on the morning of day 14. Significant increases in number of [125I]FSH-binding sites and Kd values were observed in LRX rats on day 15 postpartum. These results clearly show that litter removal at midlactation (day 13) induces the reinstatement of hormonal cyclicity, and this is accompanied by changes in ovarian FSH receptors.\r"

Basal plasma irPRL levels were significantly higher, while bioPRL were significantly lower in old compared to young rats. Administration of 10 mg/kg morphine similarly increased plasma irPRL levels in both age groups, but elevations in bioPRL were significantly lower in the older animals. Administration of 1 mg/kg haloperidol significantly increased circulating levels of ir- and bioPRL in both age groups, but these responses were significantly attenuated in the older rats. Treatment with 10 mg/kg bromocryptine resulted in significantly greater decreases in plasma irPRL levels in young rats, but induced similar decreases in bioPRL levels in both age groups. Administration of 25 micrograms/kg TRH induced similar increases in both ir- and bioPRL levels in young and old male rats. These results demonstrate that basal plasma bioPRL levels are significantly lower in old compared to young male rats, and specific drug treatments differentially alter the ratio of plasma bio- vs. irPRL levels in these age groups. These findings suggest that during the aging process not only quantitative changes but also qualitative changes occur in PRL secretion, which result in an overall decline in the biopotency of PRL released into the circulation.\r"

Removal of extracellular Ca2+ (by chelation with EGTA) or addition of the Ca channel blocker nimodipine (1 microM) produced a rapid fall in [Ca2+]i, which occurred whether TTX was present or not. Excess K+ (60 mM), veratridine (10 or 100 microM) and BAY K 8644 (1 microM) each caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, which was blocked or truncated by EGTA or nimodipine. TTX blocked or truncated the increases in [Ca2+]i induced by veratridine, but not those induced by either excess K+ or BAY K 8644. The results show that manipulations that increase or decrease hormone output increase or decrease [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, the resting [Ca2+]i appears to depend importantly on Ca influx, since it is rapidly and markedly reduced by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of a Ca channel blocker.\r"

  ".U": "90126599\r", 
  ".W": "A deficiency of luteal cell prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) receptors might help explain the well documented refractoriness of pig corpora lutea to the luteolytic effects of PGF2 alpha administered in vivo before day 12 of the estrous cycle. Accordingly, experiments were conducted to measure the levels of [3H] PGF2 alpha-binding sites/receptors on collagenase-dispersed pig luteal cells taken at different stages of the estrous cycle. Pig corpora lutea were obtained surgically at various stages of the estrous cycle and dissociated with collagenase in medium 199. Dissociated mixed luteal cells (approximately 5-15 x 10(4) large luteal cells/tube) were assayed for [3H]PGF2 alpha-binding activity by saturation (Scatchard) analysis. In preliminary experiments it was determined that PGF2 alpha binding was maximal after incubation for 45 min at 30 C in assay buffer of pH 5.75. Additionally, it was determined that [3H]PGF2 alpha binding was displaceable by PGF2 alpha = PGD2 greater than PGE2 greater than 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2 alpha. Other eicosanoids did not inhibit [3H]PGF2 alpha binding. Two distinct classes of binding sites (high affinity Kd = 19-64 nM; low affinity Kd = 262-3103 nM) were observed at all stages of the estrous cycle. From studies using enriched (by elutriation) large (greater than 30 microns) and small (10-20 microns) luteal cells it appeared that the high affinity binding site was largely confined to large luteal cells, whereas the low affinity binding site was found on both large and small luteal cells. The concentrations (number per large luteal cell) of high affinity PGF2 alpha-binding sites of mixed (unelutriated) luteal cell preparations was low on days 6-8 (0.6 x 10(6) sites/cell) and increased gradually up to 1.4 x 10(6) sites/cell on day 12. The concentrations of binding sites were increased approximately 3-fold on day 13 (4.6 x 10(6) sites/cell; P less than 0.05 vs days 6-12) and remained elevated on days 14 and 16-17 (approximately 3 x 10(6) sites/cell). In summary, these results indicate the existence of a high affinity PGF2 alpha-binding site in pig (large) luteal cells, which is probably the luteal PGF2 alpha receptor. The numbers of these putative PGF2 alpha receptors are low during the early luteal phase (before day 12), but increase thereafter (days 13, 14, and 16-17). This may provide one explanation for the observed refractoriness in vivo of pig corpora lutea to PGF2 alpha before, and increased sensitivity to PGF2 alpha after, day 12 of the estrous cycle.\r"

Secretagogues acting in part through receptors linked to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins [CRF and somatostatin (SS)] and agents by-passing membrane receptors (phorbol myristate acetate and dexamethasone) were examined. Effects on the secretory product were evaluated by measuring levels of pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA and hormone secretion. Effects on posttranslational processing enzymes were evaluated by measuring levels of the mRNAs encoding carboxypeptidase-E and peptidyl-glycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM); cellular levels of PAM activity were also measured. The mRNAs encoding the G-proteins in AtT-20 cells were identified, and secretagogue effects on the G-protein signal transduction system were evaluated by measuring levels of the mRNAs encoding (alpha s, alpha)i2, and beta 2. No single parameter adequately characterizes the regulatory state of the complex secretory apparatus. Although levels of pro-ACTH/endorphin (PAE) mRNA accurately reflected hormone secretion after chronic CRF or dexamethasone treatment, chronic SS treatment elevated PAE mRNA levels in the face of reduced hormone secretion. Levels of PAM mRNA generally changed in parallel with levels of PAE mRNA; in contrast, levels of carboxypeptidase-E mRNA were unaffected by any of the secretagogues tested. Secretagogues acting through distinct G-proteins (CRF and SS) as well as dexamethasone brought about a coordinate increase in the level of the mRNAs encoding the three G-protein subunits examined. Treatment with phorbol myristate acetate caused a slight decrease in the levels of the G-protein subunit mRNAs.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied primary human fetal thyroid cell monolayers as an in vitro model for thyroid cell growth and function. Fetal thyroid cells grew slowly in a serum-free medium under basal conditions (i.e. without insulin and TSH), with a doubling time of 112 +/- 7 h (mean +/- SEM), indicating autonomous growth capacity. Addition of insulin (10 micrograms/ml) lead to increased growth, with a doubling time of 43.0 +/- 2.5 h, and TSH further reduced the doubling time in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest growth rate at 1-10 mU/ml (doubling time, 27 +/- 0.5 h). These growth rates were only observed when cells were subjected to a short culture time (12 h) before investigation, whereas after 96 h of culture the fetal thyroid cell growth rate was reduced by up to 50%. Addition of more than 5% serum completely inhibited the growth stimulation initiated by insulin and TSH. The accumulation of extracellular cAMP by the fetal cell monolayer was induced by TSH in a dose-dependent manner and reached a maximum effect at 10 mU/ml (4.8 +/- 0.6 pmol cAMP). Basal thyroglobulin (Tg) release was 26.9 +/- 0.5 ng/10(5) cells.day. Insulin decreased Tg release to 16.7 +/- 0.5 ng/10(5) cells,day, whereas TSH increased it up to 52.5 +/- 1.0 ng/10(5) cells.day. The T cell cytokine gamma-interferon, a product of the lymphocytic infiltrate in autoimmune thyroid disease, significantly reduced both insulin and TSH-stimulated cellular growth as well as accumulation of Tg. In conclusion, human fetal thyroid cell monolayers grew at high velocity under defined experimental conditions in vitro. These conditions included a low serum concentration, short culture time before investigation, and insulin/TSH supplementation. Furthermore, this human thyroid model confirms our earlier observations on the influence of cytokines in thyroid cell growth regulation.\r"

  ".U": "90126613\r", 
  ".W": "The observation that increases in extracellular Ca2+ or the addition of divalent cations, such as Ba2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Sr2+, stimulate the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and its breakdown products in parathyroid cells strongly supports the idea that polyphosphoinositides are hydrolyzed under these conditions. Since phosphatidic acid is produced as a result of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, and it has been proposed that phosphatidic acid may be a second messenger for Ca2+ mobilization, we examined the effects of this compound on parathyroid cells. We assessed PTH release, intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and inositol polyphosphate accumulation in response to phosphatidic acid. Natural phosphatidic acid reduced PTH release at 1.0 mM extracellular Ca2+ by 18 +/- 6%, 48 +/- 5%, 59 +/- 10%, and 79 +/- 6% at concentrations of 1, 10, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively (n = 5-11). The effect was not dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, since phosphatidic acid (100 micrograms/ml) inhibited PTH secretion by 39 +/- 3% in medium with no added Ca2+ and 1.0 mM EGTA (n = 3). This agent rapidly and transiently increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by fura-2 fluorescence. At 1.0 mM extracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i rose from 309 +/- 8 to a peak of 356 +/- 26, 454 +/- 22, and 587 +/- 57 nM with the addition of 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml phosphatidic acid, respectively (n = 2-14). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (i.e. medium with 1 or 2 mM EGTA and no added Ca2+), phosphatidic acid produced a quantitatively smaller peak increment of 38 +/- 4% in [Ca2+]i, indicating that this compound could mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores (n = 3). At 1.0 mM extracellular Ca2+, phosphatidic acid (200 micrograms/ml) stimulated the accumulation of Inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), Inositol bisphosphate (InsP2), and Inositol monophosphate (InsP1) by 46 +/- 9%, 37 +/- 9%, and 59 +/- 11% after 60 sec, respectively (n = 5-7). Phosphatidic acid had no significant effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. We further determined whether the specific fatty acid composition of phosphatidic acid might influence its effects in parathyroid cells by testing several synthetic compounds. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml) inhibited PTH release in a dose-dependent manner without significantly changing [Ca2+]i. Dioleoyl phosphatidic acid had modest biphasic effects on secretion, with 20 +/- 5% inhibition observed at lower doses (10 micrograms/ml) and a 27 +/- 8% stimulation of secretion at 100 micrograms/ml (n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on acute secretion of PRL by pituitary lactotrophs was examined under basal conditions and after treatment with TRH or dopamine. We used the reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA) to determine the amount of PRL secreted per lactotroph and the percentage of pituitary cells secreting PRL. Young (2- to 3-month-old) female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and 1 week later implanted with a Silastic capsule containing 180 micrograms/ml estradiol in sesame oil. Three days later, rats were killed, anterior pituitaries were removed, and cells were enzymatically dispersed and prepared for use in the RHPA. In Exp I, time and dose responses to bFGF were determined using the RHPA. Basic FGF reduced (P less than 0.0001) the mean basal secretion of prolactin per lactotroph. The effect was similar at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min of incubation. The reduction in PRL was greatest at 3.36 x 10(-6) M, while lesser reductions were observed at 1.68 x 10(-6) and 5.60 x 10(-7) M. A dose of 3.36 x 10(-6) M (60 ng/ml) and an incubation time of 60 min were subsequently used in Exp II. In Exp II, we examined the effects of bFGF on TRH stimulation and dopamine inhibition of PRL secretion. PRL secretion was maximally stimulated (P less than 0.01) by 10(-7) M TRH. Basic FGF blocked the TRH-induced increase in PRL secretion. PRL secretion was maximally reduced (P less than 0.001) by 10(-5) M dopamine. Coincubation of bFGF with dopamine reduced (P less than 0.01) the mean plaque area to the same extent as dopamine alone. In each experimental situation changes in mean plaque area reflected a shift in the frequency distribution of the plaque area. Neither bFGF, TRH, dopamine, nor the combined treatments influenced the percentage of pituitary cells secreting PRL compared to basal conditions. We have demonstrated that 1) bFGF reduces the basal secretion of PRL in an acute manner; 2) bFGF blocks the TRH-induced increase in PRL; and 3) bFGF does not potentiate the inhibitory effect of dopamine on PRL secretion and, therefore, may act in part through the same inhibitory pathway as dopamine. We conclude from these data that bFGF, or related factors, could play a role in the regulation of PRL secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90126618\r", 
  ".W": "Having demonstrated that plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) bind T4 through a specific interaction with their sole apolipoprotein, apoB-100, we tested the hypothesis that cells could internalize the LDL-T4 complex via cell surface LDL receptors. These receptors are down-regulated by cholesterol loading and up-regulated by cholesterol deficiency. We, therefore, studied the uptake of [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 by human skin fibroblasts grown in 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum in the absence or presence of LDL. At concentrations of LDL (12.5 and 22 micrograms protein/ml) that gave significant binding of T4 but did not exceed LDL receptor capacity, both the initial rate of saturable T4 uptake and the uptake at equilibrium increased by 27-63%. No significant increase occurred at a LDL concentration of 1.6 micrograms protein/ml (less than 3% occupancy), whereas there was a 20 to 31% reduction at 125 micrograms/ml (approximately 5 times the saturation dose for the LDL receptor). These changes were confirmed with several different LDL preparations and were mimicked by isolated apoB-100 and apoE, the sole ligands for the LDL receptors (apoB/E receptors). T4 uptake did not increase in normal fibroblasts with down-regulated LDL receptors or in LDL receptor-deficient fibroblasts from a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia. In the latter cell line the uptake of T4 (and T3) in the absence of LDL was indistinguishable from that of normal fibroblasts. T3 uptake in normal fibroblasts was not enhanced by LDL. The specificity of the LDL effect was shown by the finding that T4-binding globulin, prealbumin, or serum albumin, at concentrations giving 10-90% T4 bound, failed to increase T4 uptake. Instead, each of these major thyroid hormone-binding plasma proteins caused a dose-dependent decrease in T4 entry. It is concluded that at least two modes of entry into fibroblasts are available for T4. The first is the cell surface thyroid hormone-binding sites, which recognize the free hormone and are present in both normal and LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts. The second, and additional, mode of entry is via the LDL receptors, which recognize the T4-LDL complex, are absent in LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts, are reduced in down-regulated fibroblasts, and are unavailable for T3, owing to the low affinity of T3 for LDL.\r"

  ".W": "The development of pituitary GnRH receptors was studied in the rat with in vitro and in vivo autoradiography. GnRH receptors were first seen in pituitary primordia of 13-day-old fetuses. The binding was specific and saturable and was abolished in the presence of 10 microM synthetic GnRH. To examine whether GnRH was available to the fetus, amnionic fluid was collected on days E 12-18. RIA analyses showed that GnRH levels in the amnionic fluid were low on days 12 and 13 (0-20 pM/ml) and rose to 225 pM/ml on day E 16 before they declined to 110 pM/ml on fetal day E 18. The highest levels of GnRH in the amnionic fluid on day E 16 coincided with the first appearance of immunoreactive LH cells, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Intravenous injection of 500 microliters amnionic fluid into pentobarbital-anesthetized adult rats caused a transient 40-60% increase in circulating serum LH in the recipient animal. To show that GnRH from the amnionic fluid has access to the developing pituitary, the 125I-labeled GnRH agonist Buserelin was injected into the amnionic fluid of 13-, 14-, and 15-day-old fetuses in the presence or absence of 10 microM unlabeled GnRH. Autoradiographic analysis of the fetal tissue indicated that the labeled GnRH agonist bound to specific receptors in the primordial pituitaries. The results suggest that the pituitary gonadotropes are differentiated before day E 13 because the expression of GnRH receptors is already an indication of cell determination. Since GnRH is present in the amnionic fluid in a biologically active form and can reach the fetal pituitary, it is concluded that GnRH may be an important factor determining the onset LH synthesis, but not the differentiation, of primordial pituitary cells.\r"

Vehicle or 1 microgram LHRH was injected sc twice daily for 6 days, and rats were decapitated 16 h after the last injection. Treatment with LHRH caused nearly a doubling in the numerical density of LH and FSH cells and in the percentage of APG cells that contained LH or FSH. It also caused a shift in the gonadotroph population from LH and LH/FSH cells to LH/FSH cells. It did not change the mean size of gonadotrophs or APG weight. These changes at the light microscopic level were not accompanied by any apparent changes in LH cells at the ultrastructural level. However, they were accompanied by an approximate doubling of the basal serum LH and FSH concentrations, an increase in the APG FSH concentration, and an increase in the basal FSH release rate (measured in vitro). The results indicate that exogenous LHRH can be administered to increase numbers of gonadotrophs in the APG, synthesis of FSH in gonadotrophs, and basal serum LH and FSH concentrations.\r"

The sum of follicle-stimulating hormone measured before and after CC intake, is the parameter that correlated best with subsequent response to COH. The upper limit of the reference value for this parameter, established by considering the CC challenge test performed on 26 patients who became pregnant, was 26.03 mIU/mL. Twenty patients who presented a CC challenge test result above the reference value were compared with patients with a normal test result. For these 20 patients, COH required more hMG and was cancelled in 25% of the cases (instead of 1% in the control group). The number of follicles aspirated, oocytes retrieved, and embryos obtained were on average six times lower than in patients with a CC challenge test result within the reference value, and no pregnancy was obtained.
