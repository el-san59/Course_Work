  ".U": "90322155\r", 
  ".W": "The inflammatory infiltrate was characterised in 20 samples of prostatic hyperplasia using cell surface specific monoclonal antibodies. The infiltrate was composed predominantly of CD-3+ T-lymphocytes. The distribution of the T-lymphocyte subsets (CD-4 and CD-8) between the epithelial and stromal components of the gland was significantly different, with most of the intra-epithelial infiltrate being CD8+, T cytotoxic/suppressor cells. This may be a necessary immunological barrier, as in the epididymis, to prevent the development of autoimmunisation to sperm antigens. Large numbers of CD4+ T helper/inducer cells and significant numbers of CD-11c+ macrophages were demonstrated in the extra-glandular stromal tissues, suggesting a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. Intraprostatic spermatozoa have been demonstrated recently and we have confirmed this finding on post mortem specimens. It is postulated that the presence of an intra-epithelial cytotoxic barrier and the marked stromal infiltrate may be due, in part, to the intermittent presence of spermatozoa within the prostate.\r"

Ten patients developed metastases, 5 died of prostatic carcinoma and 24 died of other causes. Cox's regression analysis showed that the initial cytological grade of the tumour was of prognostic importance, but initial local tumour stage, prostatic acid phosphatase activity and age had no statistically significant prognostic value. Although the number of patients developing metastases and dying of prostatic carcinoma was low, most tumours seemed to progress locally.\r"

The devices that have been developed over recent years have defined penile rigidity in terms of stiffness. Penile stiffness, however, is believed to result from an increase in intracavernous pressure. The device presented here was therefore designed to estimate intracavernous pressure, rather than penile stiffness, as an index of penile rigidity. Validation of the penile cuff device was achieved by simultaneously recording penile cuff pressure and intracavernous pressure on patients undergoing artificial erections. The results showed a linear relationship and highly positive correlation coefficients between the 2 measures. The results demonstrate that the penile cuff may be used to estimate intracavernous pressure as an index of penile rigidity. The findings are discussed in terms of the possible applications of the cuff as a clinical tool to measure both penile tumescence and penile rigidity.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 154 patients with non-seminomatous germ cell testicular tumours were reviewed to determine the potential effect of prompt diagnosis and orchiectomy on morbidity and mortality from this disease. Orchiectomy was performed 30 days or less after the onset of testicular symptoms on 65 patients (Group 1) and more than 30 days after the onset of symptoms on 89 patients (Group 2). The initial clinical stages of Group 1 patients were: I, 40 (62%); II, 14 (22%); III, 5 (8%); marker only, 6 (9%). The initial clinical stages for Group 2 patients were: I, 25 (28%); II, 15 (17%); III, 35 (39%); marker only, 14 (16%). The difference between the percentages of Group 1 and Group 2 patients with stage I disease was statistically significant, as was the difference between the percentages of Group 1 and Group 2 patients with stage III disease. One of the Group 1 patients died, whereas 11 of the Group 2 patients died. In 5 of the Group 2 patients who died, orchiectomy had been performed more than 120 days after the onset of testicular symptoms. This study suggests that orchiectomy performed promptly after the onset of testicular symptoms not only helps to reduce mortality from testicular cancer but also has a major effect on its morbidity by reducing the need for systemic chemotherapy or major surgery.\r"

The hypothesis that children with bladder instability and dysfunctional voiding represent 2 separate populations was also examined. A simplified urodynamic method was used to evaluate 191 children and they were divided into 3 groups: 64 had normal bladders which were stable during filling and voiding was co-ordinated and complete; 97 had unstable bladders but voiding was normal and co-ordinated; 30 had dyssynergic voiding and an increased volume of residual urine. The urodynamic evaluations were helpful in distinguishing the large number of children with normal findings in whom the problem was motivational. The children with unstable bladders had a physiological abnormality due to delayed maturation and in these cases anticholinergic and musculotrophic agents were usually helpful. The dysfunctional voiders had serious behavioural problems, were difficult to treat, and often required a multidisciplinary approach. These data indicate that there are indeed 2 distinct groups: 1 with instability alone and 1 with dysfunctional voiding with or without instability. Although infection and/or reflux are common in the former, the more devastating urinary tract changes, particularly heavy trabeculation and elongation of the bladder, occur in the latter group.\r"

Octreotide, third-line treatment in 14 patients, produced objective responses in four patients (28%) (median duration of response, 16 months). The median survival from diagnosis in malignant cases was 6.7 years. Even if none of the current medical therapies are curative for patients with malignant endocrine pancreatic tumors, a prolonged survival would be observed during the last decade. Since the age at diagnosis has not been dramatically reduced despite improvements in diagnostic methods, the prolonged survival might be attributed to causal medical treatment.\r"

Therapeutic results included 24% complete and 34% partial response rates, median time to disease progression of 32 weeks, and median survival of 46 weeks. In three consecutive cohorts of patients the dose of either tamoxifen or verapamil were escalated by 25% and 33%, respectively. The cohort of patients receiving verapamil 360 mg/day and tamoxifen 100 mg/day (level 2) had slightly more toxicity but also more responses than the other groups.

Ten of them were treated prospectively with a radiation-chemotherapy protocol. All but four specimens were recently reexamined and classified according to the Working Formulation system. The predominant histologic types were diffuse large cell type, large cell immunoblastic type, and diffuse mixed small and large cell type, seen in 38%, 21%, and 21% of cases, respectively. Before 1980, 16 patients were treated with postoperative radiation without definite chemotherapy, and only one has survived more than 5 years. Local recurrence was the most common cause of failure. In 1981, the authors started a protocol in which four to six courses of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEPA) was given after whole brain radiation (30-40 Gy) with a local boost up to 50 to 60 Gy. Eight patients completed this protocol, and all of them are alive at 16 to 100 months after diagnosis, with three patients surviving more than 5 years. Only one patient developed recurrence. On the other hand, six patients who did not complete or receive chemotherapy after 1981 are dead or alive with recurrence. Correlation between the Working Formulation subtype and prognosis was not clear because of the variety of treatment. Two patients receiving chemotherapy developed brain necrosis, which was fatal in one case, and the other two patients treated with the protocol are in a poor state without signs of recurrence. Chemotherapy may enhance the radiation effect on normal brain tissue as well as tumor. Combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate, but the optimal dosage needs to be investigated further.\r"

Altogether 20 patients (49%) showed some abnormality in cardiac tests.

The risk for an abnormal cardiac test result in the 13 patients who had received cardiac irradiation was 12.8-fold (95% confidence limits, 1.8-90.8; P less than 0.02) that of the other patients. However, abnormalities in cardiac function were mild.\r"

These patients were treated from 1974 to 1985 with quality-controlled high-dose radiation therapy. The validity of CS versus RS was checked in this study with the parameter of recurrence-free adjusted survival (RFADS) at 3 and at 5 years. It appears that RS is more valid and has therapeutic implications in planning the target volume for irradiation. The CS should be regarded as inadequate for radiotherapeutic considerations. The International Union Against Cancer (UICC) 1987 norms for staging laryngeal carcinoma (clinical, endoscopic, and imaging) should be strictly followed.\r"

  ".W": "Radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy were done on 875 patients diagnosed with cervical carcinoma Stages IB (484 patients), IIA (96 patients), and IIB (295 patients). The number of positive nodes was 0 in 620 patients (N0), one in 98 patients (N1), two to three in 80 patients (N2), four to 18 in 45 patients (N4), and unresectable in 32 patients. Cumulative 5-year survival rates were 89%, 81%, 63%, 41%, and 23%, respectively. Significant survival reduction rates (P less than 0.05) from N0 to N1 were insignificant in Stage IB patients (92% versus 91%), in those patients without parametrial invasion (92% versus 90%), and in those with parametrial invasion (76% versus 72%). Survival reduction rates (P less than 0.01) from N1 to N2 resulted from a reduction in IB patients without parametrial invasion (100%-71%, P less than 0.01). Survival reduction rates (P less than 0.05) from N2 to N4 resulted from a reduction in Stage IIB patients with parametrial invasion (60%-29%, P less than 0.05). These figures suggest that the number of positive nodes is a more indicative prognostic factor than the existence of nodal metastasis, and that the 5-year survival rates of those patients with one positive node can be improved up to the level of those without nodal metastasis.\r"

In addition, two patients with advanced small cell carcinoma of the bladder who were treated successfully with radical cystoprostatectomy and adjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy (M-VAC) are presented. Both men had regional lymph node involvement and are disease free at follow-up of 1 year and 2.5 years, respectively. This is the first report of combined surgical and M-VAC chemotherapy in the treatment of undifferentiated small cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

The number of Leu7+ and Leu11+ cells was within normal range. In terms of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antigens, IL-2R/p55 (Tac) was marginally expressed whereas IL-2R/p75 related antigen recognized by YTA-1 monoclonal antibody (MAb),i.e., YTA-1 antigen, was moderately expressed on the patient's mononuclear cells. Since the NK activity was restored in vitro by IL-2 stimulation, insufficient in vivo IL-2 production or altered cooperation of IL-2R/p75 and IL-2R/p55 (Tac) in the IL-2 mediated immune response was suspected to be present. The induction of IL-2R/p55 (Tac) in vitro was found to be imparied after stimulation with IL-2, or YTA-1MAb. When the patient attained remission the IL-2R/p55 (Tac) induction had normalized, but low NK activity persisted. The results indicate that the IL-2/IL-2R system may play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of FEL.\r"

In two hamartomas AR was present, while in one chordoma both PGR and AR were present. In this latter tumor ER were not assayed due to insufficient material. The receptors were present in concentrations between 10 and 20 fmol/mg protein. Exceptions were two meningiomas and a chordoma with a high concentration of PGR and AR. Our results support the notion that a proportion of intracranial tumors contains sex steroid receptors, and some of these tumors might be hormonally dependent.\r"

The EGFR status was not correlated with axillary lymph node involvement, tumor size, stage, and histologic type, but significantly correlated with histologic grading (P less than 0.05) and lymphatic invasion (P less than 0.01). Between EGFR and estrogen receptor (ER) status, a clear inverse relationship was observed (P less than 0.01). The Ki-67-positive stained cell rate, which reveals the proportion of cycling cells, was significantly higher in EGFR-positive tumor tissues than in EGFR-negative cases. Furthermore, preliminary postoperative survey demonstrated a high tendency of recurrence rate of patients with EGFR-positive tumors as compared with those with EGFR-negative tumors. These data suggest that EGFR status may be important for the prediction of biologically high malignant potential.\r"

Histologically, one AHN was benign, while the other four contained malignant hepatocellular foci. Iron staining and quantitation of tissue iron revealed that AHN were rich in iron, but the malignant hepatocellular foci and surrounding regenerative nodules were relatively poor in iron. The MRI showed that AHN were hypointense while malignant hepatocellular foci and surrounding regenerative nodules were isointense. Thus, malignant hepatocellular foci within AHN corresponded to iron-poor isointense foci. These findings suggest that malignant hepatocellular foci arising in iron-accumulating AHN are resistant to iron accumulation and that iron-accumulating AHN can be recognized with MRI in vitro as hypointense and malignant foci as isointense.\r"

The prognostic value of 16 biomarkers (alpha-1-antitrypsin [AAT], adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG], immune complexes, immunoglobulins, N-terminal peptide of proopiomelanocortin [NTERM], and tumor-associated antibody [TAA]) was tested by adding these to the model of age, gender, stage, morphology, Feinstein's classification of symptoms, Karnofsky scale, leukocyte count, recent weight loss, and liver enzymes. Using Cox's regression method and a forward stepwise procedure, seven biomarkers (ACTH, AAT, AFP, calcitonin, HCG, TAA, and prolactin) entered the model. Elevated levels of cortisol and TAA were associated with longer survival. The selection of biomarkers by stepwise regression needs to be interpreted with caution, especially since the Z scores were found to be dependent on the particular variables included in the model. Furthermore, when dichotomized on maximum of the normal laboratory values, HCG and AFP were infrequently (2%) elevated. The lack of correlation among the biomarkers supports the hypothesis of random derepression of the genome of cancer cells. Further studies in improved modeling and the formulation of a biomarker index could enhance our understanding of the biology of cancer.\r"

The colorectal samples belonged to six groups: normal mucosa from patients without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) colorectal cancer, adenomas (Group 3), and cancers corresponding to the three stages of the Dukes' classification (Groups 4 to 6). Results indicated that analysis of the morphonuclear parameters computed on 250 to 300 nuclei/cases objectively and quantitatively showed the adenoma-cancer sequence. This need for only a small number of nuclei to assess a highly efficient analysis created a preoperative investigative tool using cytologic smears during endoscopy. The authors also made preliminary data banks for objective and reproducible grading of unknown cases by comparisons (discriminant analyses) with their contents. This approach must be validated prospectively on a large series of cases to furnish a system for colorectal malignancy diagnosis.\r"

The number of patients in Stage I was six; Stage II, 11; Stage III, 16; and Stage IV, 15. All patients were naturally or surgically postmenopausal. Blood samples were taken at the first admission to the hospital and 14 cases with large tumors were followed with monthly sampling during chemotherapy, and in 13 cases until a recurrence of the tumor. CA 125 and steroid production were analyzed using radioimmunoassay. The results show a high correlation between initial CA 125 and especially progesterone plasma concentration. Both decreases during chemotherapy parallel the shrinkage of the tumor and increase 1 to 4 months before recurrence. Progesterone and CA 125 together predicted all recurrences but none of the factors alone. The prognostic value for 5-year survival was somewhat higher for progesterone than CA 125. CA 125 correlated highly with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and negatively with albumin. The correlation may be due to the intercorrelation with tumor burden.\r"

The GST activity was significantly higher in TCC in comparison with ANE (ten fold) and with HC (five fold). This activity was also significantly higher in HC than in ANE (two fold). The Km values obtained in the whole population (1.26 +/- 0.3 X 10(-3) mol/l) suggest that a unique form of isoenzyme is present in the UB epithelium and that it is the same acidic form \"rho\" described in erythrocytes. The GSH content was significantly higher in TCC than in ANE (2.5 fold) and also that in HC (three fold). A good correlation between GST activity and GSH content was observed in HC but not in TCC or ANE. These results demonstrate the relation between the activity of the GST system and the development of the TCC as well as its role in the cellular resistance to chemotherapy. A possible decrease of the GST activity before the development of the tumor is also discussed.\r"

In these patients, body temperature was monitored by means of a 0.01 degrees C-sensitive linear transducer coupled with a digital multimeter. The palm of the hand (after it was passively closed in a fist by a full bandage) was the body site where temperature measurement was found to be most comfortable for a sleeping patient and independent of movements during sleep. A good correlation was found between the hand temperature taken with this technique and oral temperature. Of six patients with sweating as their only symptom, sweating recurred during the night in four and during the afternoon in the other two. In all patients sweating was preceded by a critical 0.5 to 1.5 degrees C increase in hand temperature, which took place no more than 30 minutes before sweating. Those with nocturnal sweats awakened during the subsequent sweating-related, rapid temperature decrease. These results are consistent with the occurrence of slight unperceived febrile pulses that precede sweating. The only peculiarity of night sweats consists in the higher probability that a preceding slight temperature rise may not be perceived by a sleeping patient, who is more likely to be awakened by the discomfort of the subsequent sweating. This would also explain the small prognostic significance of these sweats, which is the same as that of the preceding fever. These results are discussed in light of the increasing clinical evidence that patients with Hodgkin's disease are often affected by an instability of the thermoregulatory hypothalamic centers.\r"

  ".W": "This work is based on the follow-up evaluation of 67 moderate (MD) or severe gastric dysplasias (SD) diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy. Forty-one patients had moderate gastric dysplasia, 22 (53.65%) had regression of MD, 14 patients (34.4%) had persistence, three (7.31%) had progression to SD, and two (4.87%) had transformation in gastric adenocarcinoma. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed with severe gastric dysplasia: in 12 patients (46.15%) gastric lesions regressed to normality (five cases), mild (six cases) or moderate dysplasia (one case); six patients (23.07%) showed persistent histologic changes of SD in the subsequent biopsy specimens; eight patients (30.7%) presented progression of lesions to gastric adenocarcinoma after 1 to 79 months of follow-up evaluation. The authors conclude that moderate and severe gastric dysplasias are preneoplastic lesions and a valuable marker of gastric cancer risk; the risk of gastric cancer after moderate or severe dysplasia is of 9.52%, excluding those cases with short follow-up. The authors claim that these patients may receive a conservative clinical treatment with frequent endoscopic studies until the appearance of either early carcinoma to indicate gastrectomy, or no dysplasia at all or mild dysplasia in specimens from at least two consecutive biopsies.\r"

From the histologic viewpoint, gastric cancer of glandular type showed preferential metastasis to the liver, whereas the nonglandular type showed a preference for peritoneal involvement and lymph node metastasis. With regard to age, peritoneal involvement was more frequently observed in younger patients for both glandular and nonglandular types. Younger patients also had a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer of nonglandular type, but not for the glandular type. Regarding liver metastasis, there was no difference in incidence between different age groups.\r"

The volume of fluid present in the stomach at the time of induction of anaesthesia was correlated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) detected by visual inspection of the pharynx and by continuous measurement of upper oesophageal pH. Mean gastric volume was 30 +/- 28 ml (range 0-210 ml). Gastric fluid volume greater than or equal to 0.4 ml.kg-1 at pH less than or equal to 2.5 was present in 46 patients. No GER was detected during induction of anaesthesia in our sample of 100 patients. Furthermore, patient age, duration of preoperative fasting, body mass index, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, preoperative anxiety, and a history of preoperative GER were not correlated with significant modifications of gastric volume or pH. We conclude that the low incidence of aspiration pneumonitis in elective surgical patients may be explained in part by the very low risk of GER, despite gastric fluid volumes of more than 0.4 ml.kg-1 in a high proportion of this patient population.\r"

It provided a clear airway in 238 of 250 elective and emergency non-obstetrical patients for a wide variety of surgical procedures, ranging from minor gynaecological and urological procedures to major abdominal and orthopaedic surgery with either spontaneous respiration or intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthetic techniques and drugs were similar to those which would have been used for the same procedures if face-mask or tracheal intubation had been employed. Blind insertion of the laryngeal mask airway was successful at the first attempt in 187 patients, some manipulation was required in 61 patients, and insertion was impossible in two patients, each of whom had a small mouth. In ten patients tracheal intubation was required because of airway obstruction or a large gas leak. The LM airway does not require laryngoscopy for its insertion, it relieves the anaesthetist's hands from holding a face-mask, it cannot be misplaced in the oesophagus, and it is well tolerated during emergence from anaesthesia.\r"

The individual log dose-logit response curve for each patient was determined using a cumulative dose plus infusion technique and integrated EMG monitoring of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The mean (+/- SEM) ED50, ED90 and ED95 values for Sch in Group 1 were 0.13 +/- 0.01, 0.19 +/- 0.01 and 0.22 +- 0.01 mg.kg-1, and in Group 2 were 0.16 +/- 0.01, 0.25 +/- 0.01 and 0.29 +/- 0.02 mg.kg-1, respectively. The mean ED values in Group 2 were significantly greater than the equivalent values in Group 1 (P less than 0.05). Compared with values in Group 1, ED values in Group 2 represented mean increases of 23, 32, and 32 per cent, respectively. These pharmacodynamic data indicate that the dose of Sch needs to be increased by 32 per cent following a defasciculating dose of dTC 3 mg.70 kg-1 (0.043 mg.kg-1).\r"

We reviewed the charts of the patients and recorded all aspects of medication and anaesthesia to try to determine whether there might be a single factor associated with this high incidence (12 per cent) of respiratory failure. Anaesthesia for all patients was induced with thiopentone, isoflurane, and N2O/O2. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with muscle relaxants in a single bolus of vecuronium, 0.07 to 0.1 mg.kg-1, or atracurium, 0.3 to 0.5 mg.kg-1. Additional doses were given according to neuromuscular activity, which was monitored visually by response to train-of-four and tetanic stimulation. Anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl/isoflurane and N2O/O2. After induction of anaesthesia, each patient received methylprednisolone, cefazolin, mannitol infusion for 24 hr beginning at the start of renal artery anatomosis, and either azathioprine (n = 57) or cyclosporine (n = 8). Relaxation was evaluated toward the end of the operation by train-of-four stimulation. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with edrophonium (0.75-1 mg.kg-1) or neostigmine (0.06-0.08 mg.kg-1). The eight patients with prolonged neuromuscular blockade received ventilatory support for one to three hours after operation. Respiratory failure was significantly more frequent in patients who received cyclosporine (P less than 0.05).\r"

Before its introduction into clinical practice in the USA, in the first phase of this study the neuromuscular potency of pipecuronium was determined under \"balanced\" and enflurance anaesthesia by the cumulative log dose-response method in 30 patients each. In the second phase the intubation and onset times, clinical duration of the first and repeated doses, spontaneous recovery index, reversibility of its residual neuromuscular effect by an anticholinesterase and its effect on heart rate and blood pressure was compared with the same variables observed in patients, anaesthetized with identical techniques but who had received vecuronium or pancuronium. The neuromuscular potency of pipecuronium was greater under enflurane (ED95 = 23.6 +/- 1.1 micrograms.kg-1 (mean +/- SEM)] than under balanced (ED95 = 35.1 +/- 17 micrograms.kg-1) anaesthesia. Pipecuronium was more potent than vecuronium under both balanced (ED95 = 45.8 micrograms.kg-1) and enflurane anaesthesia (ED95 = 27.4 micrograms.kg-1). Following the administration of 2 x ED95 doses there were no clinically significant differences in the intubation or onset times of pipecuronium, vecuronium and pancuronium. Under balanced anaesthesia the clinical duration of 2 x ED95 dose of pipecuronium (110.5 +/- 0.3 min) or pancuronium (115.8 +/- 8.1 min) were similar and about three times longer than that of vecuronium (36.3 +/- 2.1 min). The recovery indices of pipecuronium (44.5 +/- 8.2 min) and pancuronium (41.3 +/- 4.2 min) were also similar and about three times longer than that of vecuronium (14.3 +/- 1.4 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, halothane tests were carried out in the presence of either diltiazem (ten patients) or nifedipine (eight patients). These two calcium channel blockers significantly reduced the halothane contracture. Furthermore, in five of the ten MHS patients tested in the presence of diltiazem as well as in five of the eight MHS patients tested in the presence of nifedipine the halothane contracture test could be classified as negative. It is concluded that the presence of clinical concentrations of either diltiazem or nifedipine in the muscle bath affects the in vitro discrimination for MH susceptibility to halothane.\r"

Shortly after the introduction of low concentrations of gaseous agents, both infants exhibited airway obstruction although inspiratory muscle activity was still vigorous. The airway obstruction was due to approximation of the tongue to the posterior pharyngeal wall, and was easily corrected by insertion of an oral airway. The infants immediately exhibited fulminant pulmonary oedema, which responded to conventional therapy. It is postulated that paralysis of glossal muscles occurred prior to diaphragmatic paralysis, creating upper airway obstruction while preserving inspiratory muscle activity. This can rapidly lead to negative pressure pulmonary oedema in the small infant. Meticulous attention to the maintenance of an unobstructed upper airway is required if muscle relaxants are administered to the awake infant.\r"

At the same time, the waveform of the pressure tracing from his pulmonary artery catheter changed inexplicably while attempting balloon inflation as part of the assessment of the hypotensive episode. In retrospect, the changes in the pressure tracing most likely were due to alterations in the pulmonary vasculature associated with the pneumothorax. These changes can be explained in terms of a well-known physiological model. If such changes are encountered in similar circumstances, a tension pneumothorax should be suspected.\r"

During the surgery, the patient's head was turned to insert a central venous line at which time the ventilator low pressure alarm sounded and effective ventilation ceased. The problem was corrected by turning off the nasogastric tube suction. It is postulated that the nasogastric tube became unkinked when the head was turned and this led to the evacuation of gas from the lungs and breathing circuit through the nasogastric tube suction. Identification of the problem was complicated by the lack of a temporal relationship between the insertion and connection to suction of the nasogastric tube, and the episode of ventilatory failure.\r"

In this study, we analyzed the outcome of 15 consecutive young patients, who were resuscitated from pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and who were evaluated by comprehensive hemodynamic and electrophysiological testing. Patients were 11.2 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- SD) years old at the time of their event, and each was known to have some form of heart disease before sudden cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in eight patients. Accessory atrioventricular connections, with antegrade effective refractory periods less than 220 msec, were identified in three patients. Sustained atrial flutter was the only arrhythmia inducible in two patients, and no arrhythmias were inducible in two other patients. Surgical or electrophysiological-guided medical therapy resulted in noninducibility of the ventricular arrhythmias in six patients. Surgical division of the accessory atrioventricular connections was performed in three patients, and arrhythmias were not inducible after operation. The four patients with atrial flutter or without defined arrhythmia were treated with an empiric therapy. During 37 +/- 14 months of follow-up, the nine patients with documented noninducibility of a defined cause of sudden cardiac arrest were free of recurrent events. In contrast, during 18 +/- 10 months of follow-up, two of the six patients with empiric therapy or persistent inducibility of ventricular tachycardia died suddenly, and three others had recurrence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiological testing was performed in 100 consecutive patients with spontaneous asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, chronic coronary artery disease, and ejection fraction of less than 40%. Fifty-seven patients without inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias were discharged on no antiarrhythmic therapy. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in 37 patients, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was induced in six patients. Of the 43 patients with inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias, three had spontaneous cardiac arrest during serial drug testing and were excluded from further analysis. Twenty patients were discharged on drug therapy, resulting in suppression of inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias. The remaining 20 patients with persistently inducible sustained arrhythmias were discharged on drug therapy, resulting in maximal rate slowing of the induced tachycardia. During a mean follow-up of 16.7 months, there were 10 recurrent cardiac arrests or sudden deaths. The 1- and 2-year actuarial incidence of these events was 2% and 6%, respectively, in patients without inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias; 0% and 11%, respectively, in patients in whom inducible arrhythmias were suppressed; and 34% and 50%, respectively, in patients with persistently inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Multivariate Cox analysis identified only the persistence of inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias as a significant independent predictor of sudden death or recurrent sustained arrhythmias (p less than 0.001; relative risk, 3.5; 95% confidence intervals, 2.1-4.9). In this population, therapeutic intervention to prevent sudden death is unnecessary in patients without inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate determinants of hemodynamic compromise in patients with acute right ventricular (RV) infarction, we studied 16 patients with hemodynamically severe RV infarction by right heart catheterization and two-dimensional ultrasound. Severe RV systolic dysfunction, evident by ultrasound in all patients as RV dilatation and depressed RV free wall motion, was associated with a broad sluggish RV waveform, diminished peak RV systolic pressure (27.6 +/- 4.5 mm Hg), and depressed RV stroke work (4.6 +/- 2.4 g.m/m2). Paradoxical septal motion was consistently noted. In some cases, the septum bulged into the right ventricle in a pistonlike fashion and appeared to mediate systolic ventricular interaction through which left ventricular septal contraction contributed to RV pressure generation. RV diastolic dysfunction was indicated by elevated RV end-diastolic pressures (13.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), RV \"dip and plateau,\" equalization of diastolic filling pressures, and reversal of diastolic septal curvature toward the volume-deprived left ventricle. A prominent right atrial (RA) X and blunted Y descent, indicative of impairment of RV filling throughout diastole, were confirmed in all patients by their relation to RV systolic events. Patients manifested one of two distinct RA waveform morphologies differentiated by A wave amplitude and associated with disparate clinical courses. In eight patients, an RA W pattern was evident, characterized by augmented A waves; eight others manifested an M pattern constituted by depressed A waves. Compared with those with an M pattern, patients with a W pattern had higher peak RV pressures (29.6 +/- 3.8 versus 25.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), better cardiac output (3.4 +/- 0.3 versus 2.9 +/- 0.7 l/min, p less than 0.05), more favorable response to volume and inotropes, and less frequently required emergency revascularization for refractory shock (none versus five for those with an M pattern). Patients with a W pattern were more severely compromised if atrioventricular dyssynchrony developed and were more dramatically improved by restoration of physiological rhythm. Angiography in patients with depressed A waves demonstrated more proximal coronary obstruction leading to ischemic compromise of RA function, whereas in those with augmented A waves, the culprit lesion was proximal to the RV but distal to the RA branches. These results indicate that hemodynamic compromise in patients with RV infarction is exacerbated by decreased preload reserve that is dependent on atrial systole. The amplitude of the RA A wave, an indication of the status of RA function, is an important determinant of RV performance and hemodynamic compromise.\r"

Assessment of the intracardiac anatomy was also performed in an additional 12 patients who had increased anticardiolipin antibody levels but did not have SLE. Fifty patients (54%) with SLE had cardiac abnormalities, and 43 patients (46%) had normal hearts. Three categories of cardiac abnormalities were identified--valvular lesions, ranging from vegetations to valvular thickening, were found in 28%, pericardial effusion or thickening was found in 20%, and regional or global left ventricular dysfunction was found in 5%. High levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 50 patients (54%) with SLE. Of those, only 11 (22%) had an entirely normal heart, whereas the remaining 39 (78%) had at least one cardiac abnormality (valvular lesions in 20, pericardial effusion in 15, and myocardial dysfunction in five patients). In patients with SLE, the presence of abnormal intracardiac anatomy was strongly associated with increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (p less than 0.0001). The overall sensitivity and specificity of high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies in the prediction of cardiac abnormalities was 78% and 74%, respectively, with a positive predictive accuracy of 78% and a negative predictive accuracy of 74%. Eight of the 12 patients (67%) who had increased anticardiolipin antibodies but whose disease did not fulfill the American Rheumatism Association classification criteria for SLE had cardiac abnormalities similar to those in patients with SLE compared with only four (33%) who had normal hearts (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Limb vascular responses to magnesium (Mg2+) and potassium (K+) ions were studied in 19 young patients with borderline hypertension (BHT) and compared with those of 22 age-matched normotensive subjects (NT) by measuring the forearm blood flow response to intra-arterial infusion of magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride using venous occlusion plethysmography. Percent decrements of forearm vascular resistance with Mg2+ infusions were significantly less in BHT subjects than in NT (-37.2 +/- 4.2% versus -53.0 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.05, during the infusion of 0.1 meq Mg2+/min, and -52.2 +/- 4.3% versus -65.6 +/- 1.5%, p less than 0.05, during the infusion of 0.2 meq Mg2+/min). Moreover, the relation of the magnitude of Mg2+ response to initial vascular resistance in six of 10 BHT subjects lies above the 95% confidence interval for predicted values calculated for response points in 11 NT subjects, suggesting attenuated vasodilator responses of Mg2+ in a significant proportion of BHT subjects. In contrast, the response points to K+ in eight of nine BHT subjects fall within the 95% confidence interval, suggesting normal vasodilator responses to K+ in the majority of BHT subjects. Furthermore, the effect of small increments in local serum calcium concentrations on Mg2(+)- and K(+)-induced vasodilation was studied in normal volunteers. Isosmolar CaCl2 solution infused into the same brachial artery at a rate of 0.09 meq/min severely blunted the vasodilating actions of Mg2+ (-30.1 +/- 6.5% versus -65.8 +/- 3.2%, p less than 0.01, during the infusion of 0.2 meq Mg2+/min) but did not affect those of K+ (-63.1 +/- 3.1% versus -55.9 +/- 3.8%, NS, during the infusion of 0.154 meq K+/min). It appears that Mg2(+)-induced vasodilation should be due to the antagonistic action of Mg2+ to calcium, but K(+)-induced vasodilation might not be directly related to calcium movement. Thus, these attenuated responses to Mg2+ but normal responses to K+ in BHT subjects may indicate an underlying defect in vascular Mg2+ metabolism, which ultimately may be related to the alterations in calcium handling by plasma membranes rather than to the abnormalities of membrane Na(+)-K+ pump activity.\r"

The responses of right atrial (mean) and right ventricular pressures (mean, systolic, diastolic, and pulse) to 64 induced and paced supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias were studied in 10 patients (left ventricular ejection fraction of 32 +/- 6%) to develop an algorithm capable of differentiating stable from unstable rhythms. Tachyarrhythmias were defined as hemodynamically unstable when mean arterial pressure decreased by 25 mm Hg or more during 15 seconds. Mean right atrial, right ventricular systolic, and right ventricular pulse pressures were found to be useful in distinguishing the hemodynamic significance of a tachyarrhythmia. A combined detection algorithm was developed that identified a hemodynamically unstable rhythm when the heart rate was 150 beats/min or more and mean right atrial pressure increased by 4 mm Hg or more and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased by 5 mm Hg or more during 15 seconds. This algorithm was then applied to the next 20 consecutive patients (left ventricular ejection fraction of 34 +/- 4%) and compared with the current rate-only algorithm (heart rate of 150 beats/min or more) in 143 tachyarrhythmias, and the sensitivity and specificity for detection of hemodynamically unstable tachyarrhythmias were determined. The rate-only detection algorithm had 100% sensitivity but only 68% specificity for detection of unstable tachyarrhythmias, whereas the combined rate-mean right atrial pressure-right ventricular systolic pressure detection algorithm had sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Therefore, the performance of an antitachycardia system may be significantly improved by detection algorithms that integrate hemodynamic and rate criteria.\r"

Activation was recorded from 89 of 121 left free-wall and posteroseptal pathways (left APs) and from 12 of 24 right free-wall, midseptal, and anteroseptal pathways (right APs). The recorded APs were further subdivided into those exhibiting consistent antegrade conduction during sinus rhythm (overt APs: 50 left APs, eight right APs), those exhibiting intermittent antegrade conduction (intermittent APs: six left APs, two right APs), and those exhibiting only retrograde conduction (concealed APs: 33 left APs, two right APs). The sites of block were recorded during decremental atrial and ventricular stimulation. The sites of both antegrade and retrograde block were determined in 40 of 50 overt left APs and six of eight overt right APs. Antegrade and retrograde block occurred at or near the AP-ventricular (AP-V) interface in 37 of 40 overt left APs and two of six overt right APs and at the atrial-AP (A-AP) interface in one of 40 overt left APs and four of six overt right APs. In three of three overt left APs with no retrograde conduction, retrograde block occurred at or near the AP-V interface. The site of antegrade and retrograde block differed in only two of 58 overt pathways. There was no difference between overt APs limited at the A-AP or the AP-V interface in the shortest atrial or ventricular pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 antegrade or retrograde AP conduction, respectively. Both antegrade and retrograde block occurred near the AP-V interface in four of six intermittent left APs and zero of two intermittent right APs and near the A-AP interface in two of six intermittent left APs and one of two intermittent right APs. The sites of both antegrade and retrograde block were determined in 28 of 33 concealed left APs, and both occurred at or near the AP-V interface in 26 and A-AP interface in two APs. In two of two concealed right APs, antegrade block occurred at the AP-V interface. These findings suggest that both antegrade and retrograde conduction are limited by factors operating near the AP-V interface in overt left APs and at the A-AP or AP-V interface in overt right APs. Factors limiting antegrade conduction in concealed APs appear to be located almost always near the AP-V interface.\r"

The relative importance of the individual components of this echocardiographic score (valvular thickening, mobility, calcification, and subvalvular disease) to the change in valve area after valvotomy was also examined. Mean transmitral pressure gradient decreased from 16 +/- 6 to 6 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), and mitral valve area increased from 0.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p less than 0.0001). Results in individual patients were variable. Eighty-four percent (61 of 73) of patients with an echocardiographic score of 8 or less had a \"good\" outcome (final valve area greater than or equal to 1.5 cm2 and an increase in valve area of greater than or equal to 25%), whereas 58% (33 of 57) of patients with an echocardiographic score of 8 or more had a suboptimal result (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity of an echocardiographic score of 8 or less for predicting a \"good\" outcome was 72%, and the specificity was 73%. The echocardiographic score correlated negatively (r = -0.40, p less than 0.0001) with the absolute increase in mitral valve area after valvotomy, but there was substantial scatter in the data.

Hydroxyephedrine labeled with carbon 11 has been developed as a new catecholamine analogue to be used in the in vivo evaluation of presynaptic adrenergic nerve terminals by positron emission tomography (PET). To determine the feasibility of this imaging approach in the human heart, six normal volunteers and five patients with recent cardiac transplants underwent dynamic PET imaging after intravenous injection of 20 mCi [11C]hydroxyephedrine. Blood and myocardial tracer kinetics were assessed using a regions-of-interest approach. In normal volunteers, blood 11C activity cleared rapidly, whereas myocardium retained 11C activity with a long tissue half-life. Relative tracer retention in the myocardium averaged 79 +/- 31% of peak activity at 60 minutes after tracer injection. The heart-to-blood 11C activity ratio exceeded 6:1 as soon as 30 minutes after tracer injection, yielding excellent image quality. Little regional variation of tracer retention was observed, indicating homogeneous sympathetic innervation throughout the left ventricle. In the transplant recipients, myocardial [11C]hydroxyephedrine retention at 60 minutes was significantly less (-82%) than that of normal volunteers, indicating only little non-neuronal binding of the tracer in the denervated human heart. Thus, [11C]hydroxyephedrine, in combination with dynamic PET imaging, allows the noninvasive delineation of myocardial adrenergic nerve terminals. Tracer kinetic modeling may permit quantitative assessment of myocardial catecholamine uptake, which will in turn provide insights into the effects of various disease processes on the neuronal integrity of the heart.\r"

To determine whether it results from an intrinsic abnormality of vasodilating capacity of the vasculature in exercising muscle, we studied local forearm blood flow (FBF) during exercise in 13 patients with severe CHF and in eight normal untrained subjects of similar age. Intermittent forearm static exercise was performed by squeezing a hand dynamometer for 5 seconds, three times per minute, for 5 minutes at 15%, 30%, and 45% of maximum voluntary contraction. FBF was measured by mercury-in-rubber strain gauge venous plethysmography at baseline before exercise and during the last 3 minutes of each exercise state. Exercise was repeated after 24 hours of intravenous administration of milrinone in the patients with CHF. FBF increased with forearm exercise in a reproducible manner during 24 hours in the normal subjects: rest, 2.54 +/- 0.23 (0 hours), 2.90 +/- 0.23, (24 hours); 15%, 7.25 +/- 0.92, 5.85 +/- 0.56; 30%, 9.20 +/- 1.08, 10.05 +/- 0.85; 45%, 14.62 +/- 1.64, 13.85 +/- 1.09 ml/100 ml/min; p = NS, 0 versus 24 hours.

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol, a nonselective beta-antagonist with mild vasodilatory properties, were studied in patients with congestive heart failure. Fifteen patients (New York Heart Association class I-IV) underwent cardiac catheterization before and after 3 months of oral therapy with bucindolol. The left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.23 +/- 0.12 to 0.29 +/- 0.14 (p = 0.007), and end-systolic elastance, a relatively load-independent determinant of contractility, increased from 0.60 +/- 0.40 to 1.11 +/- 0.45 mm Hg/ml (p = 0.0049). Both left ventricular stroke work index (34 +/- 13 to 47 +/- 19 g-m/m2, p = 0.0059) and minute work (5.5 +/- 2.2 to 7.0 +/- 2.6 kg-m/min, p = 0.0096) increased despite reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (19 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = 0.021). There was an upward shift in the peak + dP/dtmax-end-diastolic volume relation (p = 0.0005). These data demonstrate improvements in myocardial contractility after beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol. At a matched paced heart rate of 98 +/- 15 min-1, the time constant of left ventricular isovolumic relaxation was significantly reduced by bucindolol therapy (92 +/- 17 versus 73 +/- 11 msec, p = 0.0013), and the relation of the time constant to end-systolic pressure was shifted downward (p = 0.014) with therapy. The slope of the logarithm left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-end-diastolic volume relation was unchanged (p = 0.51) after bucindolol. These data suggest that chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol improves diastolic relaxation but does not alter myocardial chamber stiffness. Myocardial oxygen extraction, consumption, and efficiency were unchanged despite improvement in contractile function and mechanical work. Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure, chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol significantly improves myocardial contractility and minute work, yet it does not do so at the expense of myocardial oxygen consumption. Additionally, bucindolol improves myocardial relaxation but does not affect chamber stiffness.\r"

Measurements from the echocardiograms were used to construct maps of the left ventricular endocardial surface from which the endocardial surface area index (ESAi) and the percent of the endocardial surface area involved by abnormal wall motion (%AWM) were calculated. The maps from entry and 3-month echocardiograms were used to classify patients based on changes in ESAi and abnormal wall motion. Two subgroups of patients were identified at entry--those with a normal ESAi (group 1, n = 50) and those with an increased ESAi (group 2, n = 7). Group 1 patients was subdivided at 3 months by changes occurring in ESAi (1A, 5% increase [n = 19]; 1B, no change [n = 23]; 1C, 5% decrease [n = 8]). The increase in ESAi (64.9 +/- 5.2 to 75.4 +/- 7.5 cm2/m2, p less than 0.0001) in group 1A was associated with global ventricular dilatation (n = 11) and clinically silent infarct extension (n = 8). Groups 1B and 1C were composed predominantly of patients with inferior infarctions, and all exhibited either no change or a significant decrease in infarct size (infarct regression). Group 2 patients demonstrated a continued increase in ESAi by 3 months (88.2 +/- 10.0 to 101.4 +/- 15.5 cm2/m2, p less than 0.007). This group comprised only patients with anterior infarctions, and all exhibited infarct expansion at the left ventricular apex. The changes in left ventricular size and functional infarct size are heterogeneous after acute myocardial infarction and relate to the initial endocardial surface area, infarct location, and functional infarct size.\r"

  ".W": "In a community-based study of 301 subjects from 61 nuclear families, two distinct phenotypes (denoted A and B) were identified by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoretic analysis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclasses. Phenotype A was characterized by predominance of large, buoyant LDL particles, and phenotype B consisted of a major peak of small, dense LDL particles. Previous analysis of the family data by complex segregation analysis demonstrated that these phenotypes appear to be inherited as a single-gene trait. In the present study, the phenotypes were found to be closely associated with variations in plasma levels of other lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein measurements. Specifically, phenotype B was associated with increases in plasma levels of triglyceride and apolipoprotein B, with mass of very low and intermediate density lipoproteins, and with decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2 mass, and plasma levels of apolipoprotein A-I. Thus, the proposed genetic locus responsible for LDL subclass phenotypes also results in an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium is a rare disorder of endomyocardial morphogenesis characterized by numerous, excessively prominent ventricular trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses. This study comprised eight cases, including three at necropsy. Ages ranged from 11 months to 22.5 years, with follow-up as long as 5 years. Gross morphological severity ranged from moderately abnormal ventricular trabeculations to profoundly abnormal, loosely compacted trabeculations. Echocardiographic images were diagnostic and corresponded to the morphological appearances at necropsy. The depths of the intertrabecular recesses were assessed by a quantitative echocardiographic X-to-Y ratio and were significantly greater than in normal control subjects (p less than 0.001). Clinical manifestations of the disorder included depressed left ventricular systolic function in five patients, ventricular arrhythmias in five, systemic embolization in three, distinctive facial dysmorphism in three, and familial recurrence in four patients. We conclude that isolated noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium is a rare if not unique disorder with characteristic morphological features that can be identified by two-dimensional echocardiography. The incidence of cardiovascular complications is high. The disorder may be associated with facial dysmorphism and familial recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "A new Doppler-derived index of the rate of left ventricular (LV) pressure rise (delta P/delta t) was evaluated for the prognostic stratification of patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. The index is derived from the continuous wave Doppler mitral regurgitation signal by dividing magnitude of LV-left atrial pressure gradient rise (delta p) between 1 and 3 m/sec of the mitral regurgitation velocity signal by the time taken (delta t) for this change. We studied the LV delta P/delta t and other echocardiographic indexes of LV function before and after mitral valve surgery in 25 patients with chronic, severe mitral regurgitation in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. There was a good correlation between postoperative ejection fraction (EF) and the derived LV delta P/delta t (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). The other echocardiographic parameters that correlated with postoperative EF were LV end-systolic dimension (r = -0.7, p less than 0.001), end-systolic volume (r = -0.69, p less than 0.001), end-diastolic dimension (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01), end-diastolic volume (r = -0.57, p less than 0.01), preoperative EF (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001), end-systolic wall stress (r = -0.61, p less than 0.01), and end-systolic wall stress normalized for end-systolic volume index (r = -0.45, p less than 0.05). With multiple regression, the LV delta P/delta t and LV end-systolic dimension (ESD) were shown to be independent predictors of postoperative EF. The postoperative EF could defined by the equation: 43 + 0.8 square root delta P/delta t--0.53 ESD (mm) (r = 0.86).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Contractile function is known to be impaired during hypoxia or metabolic inhibition, but the relative importance of activator Ca2+ deficiency compared with the accumulation of depressant metabolites remains controversial. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure the most likely mediators--intracellular [Ca2+] [( Ca2+]i), inorganic phosphate concentration [( Pi]), and pH--before and during hypoxia in perfused ferret hearts. Ca2+ transients were quantified by gated fluorine-19 NMR spectroscopy. Left ventricular developed pressure decreased to steady-state levels approximately 60% of control values after 20 minutes of hypoxic perfusion (induced by equilibrating the perfusate with 10% O2-90% N2). With hypoxia, phosphorus NMR revealed an increase in [Pi] and a mild intracellular acidosis. Both [Pi] and intracellular pH correlate well with the extent of decline of developed pressure in each heart, but multiple regression analysis points to the changes in [Pi] as the dominant influence. In contrast, [Ca2+]i at end diastole was not influenced by hypoxia, whereas the peak systolic values were paradoxically increased. The ratio of Ca2+ transient amplitude in hypoxia to that in control had no correlation with percent of developed pressure. These findings indicate that contractile failure during relatively mild, steady-state hypoxia is not due to a critical failure of any of the mechanisms that regulate cytoplasmic activator Ca2+. Instead, the accumulation of Pi (and to a lesser degree, H+) mediates hypoxic contractile dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Intermittent restoration of coronary flow during ischemia reduced myocardial damage and improved recovery of function. The mechanisms of the protective effects of intermittent perfusion were investigated in isolated rat hearts. Ventricular function was assessed as the product of developed pressure (left ventricular systolic pressure minus end-diastolic pressure) and heart rate. Recovery of function was calculated by division of the product at the end of reperfusion by that before ischemia. After 40 minutes of sustained global ischemia, intracellular Na+ (Nai) increased from 11 to 74 mumol/g dry wt. During 30 minutes of reperfusion, these hearts took up a large amount of 45Ca2+ (10 mumol/g dry wt), recovered only 24% of preischemic function, and had an increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (48 mm Hg). When the 40-minute period of ischemia was interrupted at 10-minute intervals by intermittent perfusion (three periods of 3 minutes) with either oxygenated or hypoxemic buffer, Nai increased to only 12 or 17 mumol/g dry wt, and reperfusion resulted in much lower 45Ca2+ uptake (0.5 and 0.5 mumol/g dry wt, respectively). Recovery of function was 100% of the preischemic value. When hypoxemic buffer without glucose was used for intermittent perfusion, Nai increased to 50 mumol/g dry wt, ATP was depleted, and reperfusion resulted in reduced recovery of function (76%) and moderately increased 45Ca2+ uptake (2.1 mumol/g dry wt). The role of Na(+)-K+ pump activity in maintaining low Nai was assessed by removing K+ from oxygenated or hypoxemic buffers used during intermittent perfusion. Under these conditions, Nai rose to 64 or 102 mumol/g dry wt, 45Ca2+ uptake increased to 4.4 or 9.4 mumol/g dry wt, and recovery of function was poor. There was a highly significant correlation between Nai during ischemia and reperfusion Ca2+ overload (r = 0.87) or impaired recovery of function (r = 0.96). These results indicate that prevention of an increase in Nai by maintenance of Na(+)-K+ pump activity is associated with a reduction of Ca2+ overload through Na+/Ca2+ exchange.\r"

MAPs were recorded from the septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle with silver-silver chloride electrode catheters. Ouabain (10(-5) M) was infused through the MAP recording catheter onto the endocardial surface of the septum. After infusion of 10 micrograms/kg ouabain, the amplitude of MAPs recorded from the septum (the site of ouabain infusion) decreased from 37.4 +/- 11.8 to 32.0 +/- 10.1 mV (p less than 0.01), MAP duration at 50% repolarization shortened from 160 +/- 29 to 148 +/- 34 msec (p less than 0.01), and MAP duration at 90% repolarization shortened from 198 +/- 38 to 189 +/- 46 msec (p less than 0.01). MAPs recorded from the posterior wall (the reference site) were unchanged. Delayed afterdepolarizations were recorded at the site of ouabain infusion, but not at the reference site, when the heart was paced at cycle lengths of 200-600 msec. Additional infusion of ouabain induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (mean cycle length, 369 +/- 12 msec) in all 15 dogs studied. The mean concentration of ouabain required to induce VT was 20.9 +/- 10.0 micrograms/kg. Paced QRS complexes when stimulated at the site of ouabain infusion had the same morphology as those of spontaneous VT. Local perfusion of verapamil, 0.015-0.034 mg/kg, through the MAP recording catheter onto the site of ouabain infusion completely eliminated VT and premature ventricular contractions. After perfusion of verapamil, delayed afterdepolarizations could no longer be induced by pacing. These observations indicate that induced VT originated from the site of ouabain infusion, and the presence of delayed afterdepolarizations before development of VT strongly suggests that the induced VT was due to triggered activity. Using this model, we examined the responses to rapid ventricular pacing of \"focal\" triggered VT. The first beat of the reinitiated tachycardia displayed the same morphology as the spontaneous VT. Local perfusion of verapamil, 0.015-0.034 mg/kg, through the MAP recording catheter onto the site of ouabain infusion completely eliminated VT and premature ventricular contractions. After perfusion of verapamil, delayed afterdepolarizations could no longer be induced by pacing.

To determine the best anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy to maintain stent patency after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, we implanted the flexible balloon-expandable coil stent into the left anterior descending coronary artery of 28 atherosclerotic 8-month-old Hanford miniature swine. Animals were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: group A, aspirin (1 mg/kg/day) and dipyridamole (1 mg/kg three times a day); group B, aspirin and dipyridamole (same doses) plus Coumadin (dose required to prolong prothrombin time 1.3-1.5-fold that of normal); and group C, control. Adjuvant therapy was begun 3 days before stenting. Two pigs (one from group A and one from group B) died during implantation, both without thrombosis. Twenty-six animals survived until follow-up angiography and sacrifice at 1 month. No occlusive thrombosis of the stent occurred in survivors. Reduction of the stent lumen diameter was observed in every case at follow-up. Percent lumen reduction was 19% in group A, 26% in group B, and 24% in group C. Marked smooth muscle cell hyperplasia was seen by light and transmission electron microscopy at stent struts. Scanning electron microscopy of the luminal surface showed a variable morphology consisting of normal endothelium, adherent leukocytes, stellate periluminal cells, and occasional fibrin strands and red blood cells. Luminal narrowing was not affected by anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet drugs, cholesterol level, or stent sizing. We conclude that occlusive thrombosis does not complicate stent implantation in this model but that substantial luminal narrowing due in part to smooth muscle hyperplasia does occur. The significance of luminal narrowing at the stent site requires further study.\r"

Although several endovascular stents are currently in clinical use for angioplasty of larger vessels, acute thrombosis is a troublesome complication of their use with coronary angioplasty. To study thrombus formation associated with metallic mesh endoprostheses, we have evaluated stents placed inside 3-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts incorporated into chronic exteriorized arteriovenous silicone rubber shunts in baboons. We have also compared the antithrombotic capacities of heparin and the synthetic antithrombin D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-chloromethylkene (D-FPRCH2Cl) to interrupt this platelet-dependent process for two different endovascular stents. Acute platelet deposition was continuously measured during 1 hour using gamma camera imaging of platelets labeled with indium-111 oxine.

The shunts were extended with 5-cm long, 4-mm-i.d. thrombogenic Dacron graft segments for the time of infusion. The plasma level of the enzyme, the blood flow in the shunt, and the deposition of indium-111-labeled platelets and iodine-125 fibrinogen on the graft were measured. The influence of rAPC infused at doses of 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg-hr was compared with the effects of control infusions of saline. Five of eight control grafts occluded within 60 minutes, whereas there was no change in the blood flow during rAPC infusion. Deposition of platelets was inhibited by 13 +/- 10% and by 42 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) after 30 minutes of infusion at the two doses, which gave rise to circulating rAPC plasma concentrations of 0.4 and 1.9 mg/l, respectively. Both doses significantly inhibited fibrin deposition in the graft. Circulating plasma markers of thrombus formation and of fibrinolysis did not increase significantly during rAPC infusion; measurements of bleeding time were also within normal limits. Thus, rAPC, like human plasma-derived APC, inhibited thrombus formation without impairing primary hemostasis.\r"

Rings of obtuse marginal branches of the left circumflex coronary artery (conduit arteries) were studied in organ chambers. Coronary microvessels (110-220-microns diameter) were studied in a pressurized state with an in vitro microvessel imaging apparatus. Relaxation was evaluated after preconstriction with prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analogue) in conduit and resistance vessels, respectively. Conduit vessel function was not altered by ischemia with or without reperfusion. Endothelium-dependent microvascular relaxation was depressed in response to acetylcholine, ADP, and calcium ionophore A23187 after ischemia with reperfusion compared with control relaxation (ED50 as -log[M]: 6.0 +/- 0.2 [p less than 0.05], 5.1 +/- 0.4 [p less than 0.05], and 5.8 +/- 0.1 versus 6.8 +/- 0.2, 6.8 +/- 0.2, and 6.6 +/- 0.2, respectively). Ischemia without reperfusion modestly altered microvascular endothelium-dependent relaxation. Microvascular relaxation to nitroglycerin was not altered by ischemia with reperfusion. We conclude that 1) endothelium-dependent relaxation in large epicardial coronary arteries is relatively refractory to ischemia with or without reperfusion, 2) ischemia alone produces mild alterations of coronary microvascular reactivity, 3) ischemia followed by reperfusion produces a marked and selective impairment of endothelium-dependent responses in the coronary microcirculation.\r"

  ".W": "The endogenous compound adenosine may play a role in limiting myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through its ability to cause vasodilation, modulate cardiac adrenergic responses, inhibit neutrophil function, or modulate energy supply and demand of the myocardium. The local anesthetic lidocaine has been shown to be protective against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, although its mechanism of action remains unresolved. We hypothesized that administration of exogenous adenosine during reperfusion would limit the size of the infarct that results from a period of ischemia and reperfusion only when the animals are treated with lidocaine. Male, mongrel dogs (13.0-20.0 kg) were anesthetized (30 mg/kg i.v. sodium pentobarbital), and a left thoracotomy was performed. The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) was isolated and instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe, a 25-gauge nonobstructing intracoronary catheter, and a critical stenosis. The dogs were allocated randomly to one of four groups: 1) control, n = 13, (saline), 2) adenosine, n = 13, (0.15 mg/kg/ml/min i.c. for the first hour of reperfusion), 3) lidocaine, n = 9, (2.0 mg/kg i.v. given immediately before coronary artery occlusion and just before reperfusion), or 4) adenosine plus lidocaine, n = 11. The LCx was occluded for 90 minutes and reperfused for 6 hours. Regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) was determined (n = 6 per group) at 80 minutes of occlusion and at 45 minutes of reperfusion with radiolabeled microspheres. RMBF determinations revealed an increase in blood flow to the inner two thirds of the myocardium at 45 minutes of reperfusion only in the presence of the combined treatment. Adenosine treatment alone or lidocaine treatment alone did not affect RMBF. Quantification of infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium method) expressed as a percent of the area at risk revealed a significant limitation of infarct size only in the group treated with both adenosine and lidocaine: control, 47.8 +/- 6.6%; adenosine, 45.0 +/- 3.2%; lidocaine, 46.9 +/- 6.0%; and adenosine and lidocaine, 20.8 +/- 5.6%. Statistical analyses were performed with two-way analysis of variance to account for the two individual drug treatments. The findings show that intracoronary administration of exogenous adenosine, at the dose used, is only effective at limiting myocardial infarct size when administered to lidocaine-treated animals.\r"

To determine the number of occlusive episodes required to produce the preconditioning effect, we performed single or multiple occlusions of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) followed by a sustained occlusion (60 minutes) of the LCx. Anesthetized dogs underwent one (P1), six (P6), or 12 (P12) 5-minute occlusions of the LCx. Each occlusion period was followed by a 10-minute reperfusion period. A 60-minute occlusion of the LCx followed the preconditioning sequences. A control group received a 60-minute occlusion of the LCx without preconditioning. All groups were subjected to 6 hours of reperfusion after which the heart was removed for calculating infarct size (IS), area at risk (AR), and left ventricular mass (LV). The IS/AR ratio for the control group was 29.8 +/- 4.4% (n = 17), which was substantially greater (p less than 0.001) than that of the preconditioned groups: P1, 3.9 +/- 1.3% (n = 14); P6, 0.4 +/- 0.3% (n = 5); and P12, 2.9 +/- 2.8% (n = 5). There were no significant differences in the IS/AR ratio among the three preconditioned groups. The AR/LV ratio was comparable among all groups and did not differ statistically: control, 40.4 +/- 1.3%; P1, 36.2 +/- 1.7%; P6, 36.1 +/- 1.7%; and P12, 37.3 +/- 2.1%. Collateral blood flow to the inner two thirds of the risk region determined with radiolabeled microspheres during ischemia did not differ significantly between the control group (0.03 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g, n = 8) and single occlusion group (0.06 +/- 0.02 ml/min/g, n = 8), indicating that the marked disparity in infarct size could not be attributed to differences in collateral blood flow. The data indicate that preconditioning with one brief ischemic interval is as effective as preconditioning with multiple ischemic periods.\r"

We measured norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine in endomyocardial biopsies from 19 short-term (organ age, 6.6 +/- 6 months) and five long-term (organ age, 62 +/- 2 months) heart transplant patients. Results were compared with those from 10 normal control subjects. In 17 of 19 short-term heart transplant patients, myocardial catecholamines were undetectable, indicating values below 0.1 pg/micrograms noncollagen protein, which was the detection threshold of our assay. In the remaining two patients, myocardial catecholamines (pg/microgram noncollagen protein) were norepinephrine (1.4 and 3.2), epinephrine (0.8 and 1.9), and dopamine (0.9 and 2.3), respectively. In the five long-term heart transplant patients, myocardial catecholamines were not detected. Catecholamine concentrations in 10 healthy control subjects were norepinephrine (10.3 +/- 2.9), epinephrine (0.36 +/- 0.51), and dopamine (0.52 +/- 0.40). Low myocardial norepinephrine levels (less than 20% of control values) with unexplained high levels of epinephrine and dopamine were found in single transplant patients. In most heart transplant patients, however, myocardial catecholamines were undetectable up to five years after transplantation, indicating that the adrenergic response of these hearts probably depends on variations in plasma catecholamines or cardiac beta-receptor density.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between global left ventricular function at rest (evaluated during cardiac catheterization) and exercise capacity was examined in a group of 33 untreated patients with a previous anterior myocardial infarction. The resting ejection fraction (range, 24-68%) correlated poorly with exercise duration (r = 0.47) and did not separate patients with a depressed exercise capacity (exercise duration less than 500 seconds: group A, n = 18) from patients with preserved exercise tolerance (group B, n = 15). The resting left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes were comparable in groups A and B, but the diastolic pressure-volume relation was shifted upward, and the mean left ventricular pressure during diastolic filling was higher in group A than in group B (19 +/- 8 versus 14 +/- 4 mm Hg; p less than 0.02). The heart rate at maximal exercise was similar in both groups (160 +/- 16 versus 160 +/- 17 beats/min; NS), but heart rate was higher at any given level of exercise in group A than in group B. When 12 patients of group A were treated with xamoterol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, their exercise duration increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.001), and their maximal exercise heart rate decreased from 158 +/- 16 to 143 +/- 11 beats/min (p less than 0.001). This improved exercise capacity was accompanied by a downward shift of the resting diastolic left ventricular pressure-volume relation and by a decrease in mean left ventricular pressure during diastolic filling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although forensic laboratories are required to utilize GC/MS, they have flexibility in selecting instrumentation, modes of operation, and actual analytical methods. Because a laboratory's accreditation status, reputation, and economic well-being depend on consistently accurate results, it is important to use optimal analytical procedures so that reliability and accuracy are maximized. Pitfalls in conventional EI SIM techniques can lead to high rates of false-positive and false-negative results. Different mass spectrometric operating modes such as CI and full-scan can be used to complement SIM analyses. These modes are useful in solving difficult identification problems and in enhancing both specificity and sensitivity. Newer types of GC/MS systems based on ion trapping offer the promise of technologic advances in enhanced analytical performance and productivity gains. Knowledge of the advantages and potential pitfalls of different GC/MS systems as well as different ionization and detection modes is helpful in optimizing the accuracy of compound identification.\r"

It is rapid and inexpensive, so it can be clinically used on a routine basis. Reported here are the urine concentrations of marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine, and amphetamine metabolites in 790 clinical patients who either sought medical detoxification for a self-diagnosis of addiction, or a counseling and urine testing program with the self-perception that they were occasional, nonaddicted users. Mean urine concentrations of cocaine, phencyclidine, and amphetamine, but not marijuana, metabolites were significantly higher in addicted than nonaddicted patients. Sequential urine tests in addicts progressively demonstrate reduced urine concentrations for as long as several weeks if cessation of usage has occurred. Nonaddicted, occasional users usually produce a negative urine sample within 2 to 3 days. Despite some overlap in urine concentrations between addicted and nonaddicted users at the time of admission for treatment, quantitative urine testing is a valuable adjunct in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse.\r"

Additional medications such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors offer promise for the future. In selected patients, the results of heart transplantation have been extremely gratifying and frequently can return the patient with end-stage heart failure to a near-normal life-style. The physician should be mindful that most patients with heart failure need frequent attention and evaluation. Many patients with moderate to severe heart failure require multidrug regimens and close surveillance to detect electrolyte imbalance or evidence of decompensation at an early stage. Often a tenuous balance exists between pulmonary vascular congestion and orthostatic hypotension, and week-to-week or day-to-day titration of diuretic and vasodilator therapy is required. While the care of the patient with heart failure often requires considerable time and resources, judicious treatment can lead to dramatic improvement and is frequently rewarding to both the patient and physician.\r"

New techniques are available to the clinical laboratory for studying the coagulation and hypocoagulant proteins, coagulation inhibitors, and the fibrinolytic system.

Review of the referral records of these patients indicates the quality of prior evaluation for patients previously labeled as having a swallowing disorder of psychogenic origin is variable, and that once attribution of symptoms to psychogenic causes is made, the diagnosis is rarely reconsidered. We conclude that attribution of the diagnosis of psychogenic dysphagia should be made with caution, and only after thorough evaluation. Any change or progression of symptoms should prompt a careful re-evaluation.\r"

By graphic representation of these measurements on the IBM personal computer, it was possible to analyze in detail pharyngeal motor activity in terms of displacement of the pharyngeal wall. The contraction created a fairly steep narrowing of the lumen. The peristaltic wave was more difficult to analyze. Movements of the pharyngeal wall in posteroanterior projection gave good information about the constrictors. Although this technique has several inherent methodologic difficulties, its use may expand our knowledge of pharyngeal peristalsis.\r"

All patients could swallow without difficulty at the time of examination and had no dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, or sensation of abdominal fullness. Histologic examinations of residual esophagus showed microscopic esophagitis in 5 patients. Percentage of time that pH less than 4 was 42.6 +/- 10.9% (mean +/- SEM) and median pH was 4.3 +/- 1.0. The manometric examination showed no 'esophageal-like' peristaltic waves, but synchronous contractions were demonstrated in 9 patients, gastric type activity in two patients, and no activity was detected in one patient. We conclude that retained gastric peristaltic function is not a prerequisite for a good clinical outcome for swallowing and that despite vagotomy, the stomach continues to produce enough acid to maintain an acidic pH.\r"

For this purpose, we recorded 0-20 ml barium swallows in three groups of volunteers using videoradiographic, electromyographic, and manometric methods. The study findings indicated that a leading complex of tongue tip and tongue base movement as well as onset of superior hyoid movement and mylohyoid myoelectric activity occurred in a tight temporal relationship at the inception of swallowing. Two distinct general types of normal swallows were observed. The common \"incisor-type\" swallow began with the bolus positioned on the tongue with the tongue tip pressed against the upper incisors and maxillary alveolar ridge. At the onset of the \"dipper-type\" swallow the bolus was located beneath the anterior tongue and the tongue tip scooped the bolus to a supralingual location. Beginning with tongue-tip peristaltic movement at the upper incisors, the two swallow types were identical. Swallow events that occurred after lingual peristaltic movement at the maxillary incisors showed a volume-dependent forward migration in time that led to earlier movement of the hyoid and larynx as well as earlier opening of the upper esophageal sphincter in order to receive the large boluses that arrived sooner in the pharynx during the swallow sequence than did smaller boluses. The study findings indicated that timing of swallow events should be considered in reference to both swallow type and bolus volume. The findings also indicated an important distinction between peristaltic transit and bolus clearance.\r"

Real-time ultrasound scanning and barium swallow studies were used to evaluate the oral-motor functions while swallowing on 6 of the subjects. Activity of the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus was recorded during the videofluorographic studies. Saliva concentrations of amylase were determined in the referred subjects as well as 13 age-matched healthy controls. No significant difference was detected between the salivary gland flow rates and amylase concentrations of the two groups, whether stimulated or unstimulated. The pharyngeal gag reflex was absent in 9 of the 13 bulimic patients and a velar gag reflex could be elicited in only 1. All of the normal controls had both gag reflexes. All of the patients with bulimia were found to have abnormal oropharyngeal swallow patterns and an increased duration of dry swallow.\r"

Results indicated that with increased age there was a tendency for texture acceptability to increase for the easy-to-chew food. Masticatory and swallowing performance were diminished in persons with artificial dentition, and these individuals also perceived an increase in the difficulty of chewing raw carrots.

In this study group we found no significant relationships between salivary flow rates (unstimulated, stimulated) and any oral swallow measure. Evidence of a subtle, age-related oral motor change (multiple hyoid and tongue gestures) was seen but swallow duration times did not show a linear relationship to age. This study demonstrates that healthy individuals, despite a wide range in their salivary gland fluid secretory capacity, are generally similar in the characteristics of their oropharyngeal swallow.\r"

Tongue activity was recorded by tracking multiple gold pellets affixed to the tongue, utilizing the specialized research capabilities of the X-ray Microbeam facility at the University of Wisconsin. The major differences were between dry and liquid swallows, with dry swallows showing smaller range of movement, higher tongue position at the initiation of lingual propulsive activity, a slightly different direction of motion, a humped or flat rather than grooved cross-sectional contour of the tongue, lower peak velocity of motion, and slower progression of activity from tongue blade to dorsum. Within the 5-15 ml range of liquid bolus volumes, fewer consistent differences were found as a function of bolus size, and some marked individual differences in swallowing patterns were seen. Data are presented on normal within-subject variability in swallowing, with discussion of the possible contribution of sensory assessment of bolus size to the modification of oral and pharyngeal characteristics of swallowing.\r"

Careful review of the literature supports the premise that a \"delayed swallowing reflex/response\" may in fact be a variation of normal. This paper describes swallowing in normal adults. We report the videofluoroscopic measurements of bolus position at the onset of swallow. A radiopaque marker was affixed to the anterior facial arch and the distance between the head of the bolus and the anterior facial arch was measured at the onset of swallow. A statistically significant proportion of swallows (22 of 30) occurred after the head of the bolus passed the anterior facial arch. This finding suggests that there may be diverse sites for elicitation of the swallowing response/reflex rather than a single site (i.e., the anterior facial arch). The relevance of this finding to treatment using thermal stimulation is discussed, as is the versatility of the normal pharynx.\r"

In 2 patients this dysfunction remained, while in 3 it had resolved 4 weeks after the operation. Pharyngeal dysfunction was more common in patients with preoperative minor stroke and a temporary perioperative carotid shunt and in patients with a long operation time. The registered transient pharyngeal dysfunction may be due to manipulation of the cervical structures including the vagus nerve and the pharynx or due to cerebrovascular damage during the operation.

  ".W": "A polyclonal antiserum against the affinity-purified nondenatured rat 90K LH/CG receptor polypeptide was raised in rabbits, characterized, and used to study the location of the LH/CG receptor in pseudopregnant rat luteal cells and the fate of the receptor-hCG complex together with the specific anti-hCG serum during hCG-induced down-regulation by immunochemical techniques. Even at a 1:3000 dilution, the antiserum recognized a single 90K polypeptide on Western blots of both the affinity-purified receptor and the initial detergent extract of the pseudopregnant rat ovarian membranes. It recognized sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured and reduced, sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured, and native forms of the receptor on dot blots; the immunoreaction was the most intense with the native receptor. The antiserum also contained antibodies that recognized the hormone-binding site, or a region near to it, and the occupied receptor. The majority of the LH/CG receptors were located on the luteal cells in pseudopregnant rat ovaries before the induction of down-regulation. The receptor content seemed to vary among the luteal cells, however, and on single cells, suggesting both functional heterogeneity and a functional polarization of the luteal cells. Upon induction of down-regulation with hCG both the receptors and the bound hormone disappeared from the luteal cell surfaces at a very slow rate, without any simultaneous appearance of receptor- or hCG-specific immunostaining in the luteal cell interior. No accumulation of receptor degradation products capable of [125I]iodo-hCG or antibody binding could be detected on Western blots of the tissue. The polyclonal LH/CG receptor antiserum described here is useful for studying the structure and function of this receptor, particularly for immunohistochemical investigations into receptor location and regulation.\r"

  ".U": "90322890\r", 
  ".W": "Cytosolic calcium (Cai) responses to arginine vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin-II (Ang II) were examined in single rat adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells by monitoring fura-2 fluorescence with microspectrofluorimetry. ZG cells displayed dose-dependent Cai responses to a wide range of AVP and Ang II concentrations, starting from a threshold of 1 nM for AVP and less than 5 pM for Ang II. A dose-dependent delay of the onset of the Cai response was observed with both hormones. The response delay for Ang II was consistently briefer than that for the same concentration of AVP, showing a 2-3 log unit separation in the dose-response relations. After the delay, cells typically responded with an abrupt increase in Cai, which peaked within 15 sec. The amplitude of the peak Cai rise showed little dependency on AVP or Ang II concentration. At most AVP concentrations, the response consisted of Cai oscillations, with apparent fusion of these Cai oscillations at the highest AVP concentrations (1-0.1 microM). Similar oscillatory behavior was found with stimulations by much lower Ang II concentrations (0.5 nM to 5 pM). There appeared to be a 2-3 log unit shift in the sensitivity toward AVP and Ang II when Cai responses were compared. Sixty percent of ZG cells were responsive to AVP, while more than 90% displayed an elevation of Cai with Ang II. The Cai and steroid responses to 100 nM AVP and 100 pM Ang II were compared, since these two doses are reported to stimulate the phosphoinositide system to a similar extent. Individual ZG cells tested with both hormones responded with equivalent peak Cai changes, but a slightly longer response delay for AVP. The mean Cai response and aldosterone production for each secretagogue displayed parallel kinetics during 30-min stimulations. After initial oscillations, the Cai response returned to control values within 15 min of 100 nM AVP application. Likewise, the steroid output was transient. In contrast, 100 pM Ang II produced maintained Cai oscillations as well as a sustained and substantially greater aldosterone production for the same period of application. In conclusion, the disparate steroidogenic effects of AVP and Ang II appear to result from distinctly different Cai responses elicited during maintained secretagogue stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "90322892\r", 
  ".W": "Fatty acid esters of all families of steroid hormones are known to exist naturally. While their physiological roles are not clear, the C-17-fatty acid esters of estradiol are extremely potent and unusually long-lived estrogens. Thus, it appeared that increased potency would be a logical consequence of the esterification of all of the active steroid hormones. To test this hypothesis we measured the effect of an ester of corticosterone, corticosterone-21-stearate, on the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase in adrenalectomized rats. Surprisingly, while the ester is active compared to the unesterified corticoid corticosterone, there was no difference in either the magnitude or the duration of the induction of this enzyme. To determine whether the C-21-steroidal ester could itself induce this gluconeogenic response, we tested corticosterone-21-oleate and corticosterone-21-stearate as competitors for the binding of [3H] dexamethasone to the glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver cytosol. Both were poor ligands, with binding affinities of about 4% and more than 1%, respectively, compared to corticosterone. From these results, it is doubtful that the esters could act directly in vivo without prior cleavage of the fatty acid. We measured the rate of hydrolysis of corticosterone-21-stearate and estradiol-17-stearate by rat liver esterases. Corticosterone-21-stearate is hydrolyzed at a much greater rate (10- to 25-fold) than estradiol-17-stearate. Consequently, the difference in both potency and duration of response between the ester of the corticoid and that of the estrogen can be explained by the very rapid rate of conversion of the former into the unesterified form. Since the esterification of the corticoids appears not to be related to an increased biological half-life, as it is in the estrogens, the question remains as to the physiological role that they might play.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to determine whether the absence of extracellular Na+ affects cellular action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in rat renal inner medullary collecting duct cells in culture. AVP increased cellular cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. Na+ depletion promptly diminished the cellular cAMP response to AVP (1 nM AVP; 405.9 +/- 26.1 vs. 189.8 +/- 12.1 fmol/micrograms protein, P less than 0.01). The dose-response relation shifted to the right. The inhibition of the ability of AVP to produce cAMP was observed with an extracellular Na+ concentration less than 60 mM. Similar results were obtained with 2 x 10(-8) M forskolin, a diterpene activator of adenylate cyclase. Such inhibition was easily released, since only 10-min reexposure of the Na(+)-depleted cells to the control medium totally recovered the cAMP response to AVP. Extracellular Na+ depletion promptly decreased the cellular Na+ concentration from 15.8 +/- 1.0 to 5.4 +/- 0.6 mM (P less than 0.01), measured using the fluorescence dye sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate. If the Na(+)-depleted cells were again incubated with the control medium, intracellular Na+ rapidly recovered to the precontrol level. Such a change was closely related to the change in cellular pH, which decreased from 7.19 +/- 0.02 to 6.97 +/- 0.02, measured using the fluorescence dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxymethyl)-5 (and -6)carboxyfluorescein,acetamethylester. However, Na+ depletion did not affect the cellular free calcium concentration or cellular protein and ATP contents. These results indicate that Na+ depletion promptly attenuated the ability of AVP to produce cAMP mediated through either the decrease in intracellular Na+ or cellular pH in renal inner medullary collecting duct cells.\r"

  ".W": "Although the role of serotonin (5HT) in the regulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion is well documented, the involvement of specific 5HT receptor subtypes in this action is not yet fully elucidated. In the present work we attempted to determine the neuroendocrine role of the 5HT1A receptor subtype. This was chosen mainly because highly selective pharmacological tools are available for that subtype. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8OHDPAT) and ipsapirone were injected iv in conscious, freely moving male rats cannulated in the jugular vein. For the sake of comparison, a 5HT receptor agonist with preference for the 5HT1B and 5HT1C receptor subtypes 1-(m-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) was also administered. Plasma PRL, ACTH, and beta-endorphin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner after 8-OHDPAT (0.01-1 mg/kg) or ipsapirone (0.5-7.5 mg/kg) injection. Maximal effects were obtained between 7-15 min. Only the highest dose of 1-(m-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazine (5 mg/kg) resulted in the same response. In contrast, none of the drugs used affected plasma GH, TSH, or LH levels at any dose tested. The results indicate that 5HT1A receptors are involved in the regulation of PRL as well as ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion. 8OHDPAT was almost 40 times more potent than ipsapirone. The maximal effects of the two drugs on PRL release were comparable. In contrast, ipsapirone behaved as a partial agonist only on ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion, thus suggesting that different neuronal targets are involved in the stimulation of the three hormones by 5HT.\r"

  ".W": "We have used organ cultures of 18-day fetal rat duodena to study the regulation of calbindin-D9K (CaBP9K) gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3) and calcium. The epithelium of the fetal rat duodena maintained in culture for 10 days in a defined serum-free medium with no exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 contains differentiated enterocytes. Treatment with 10(-8) M 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in a 2-fold increase in CaBP9K messenger RNA (mRNA) after 1 h; CaBP9K content was increased 2.5-fold in 24 h. Simultaneous treatment of cultures with 1,25(OH)2D3 and 1 microM actinomycin D selectively blocked 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated CaBP9K mRNA and protein synthesis. Fifty micromolars of cycloheximide significantly decreased CaBP9K protein accumulation but not mRNA. These findings indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 controls CaBP9K gene transcription. Enterocytes exhibit some CaBP9K gene expression after 10 days under basal culture conditions, suggesting that CaBP9K synthesis is not dependent on 1,25(OH)2D3 alone. This basal expression drops after 24 h in a calcium free medium with 1 mM EGTA, suggesting that extracellular calcium is involved in the control of this gene. Increasing the calcium concentration to 1.2 mM resulted in a 6-fold increase in CaBP9K mRNA after 3 h and a 10-fold increase in CaBP9K protein content after 24 h. Calcium may increase CaBP9K gene transcription, since simultaneous addition of 1 microM actinomycin D and calcium blocked the calcium effect on CaBP9K mRNA. Therefore, this in vitro study demonstrates that both calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulate CaBP9K gene expression in the rat duodenum.\r"

This report describes differences in the internalization of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the two cell types using three electron microscopic approaches. Cells were incubated with a biologically active colloidal gold-labeled-IGF-I complex or [125I]IGF-I and prepared for electron microscopy. Other cells were incubated with unlabeled IGF-I and prepared for immunoelectron microscopy, using a colloidal gold-labeled anti-IGF-I antibody to detect the IGF-I. Each technique demonstrated binding of IGF-I on the surface of epithelial and differentiated fiber cells. IGF-I was internalized in epithelial cells. In contrast, the ligand exhibited little endocytosis in fiber cells during a 5 h incubation. Intracellular IGF-I was observed in the endosomes, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes of epithelial cells, in addition, it was shown for the first time that IGF-I was translocated to the nucleus of epithelial cells. The differences between epithelial and fiber cells regarding internalization and nuclear translocation of IGF-I suggest that there are cell-specific itineraries of the hormone, depending on the differentiation stage of the cell. These differences may relate to the specific biological actions of the growth factor on each of these cells, particularly in allowing proliferation and differentiation of the epithelial cells.\r"

Preliminary studies confirmed that sialoadenectomy reduced circulating EGF levels in nude mice (from 0.17 +/- 0.02 to 0.09 +/- 0.02 ng/ml), and that ip injection of 5 micrograms EGF raised EGF levels (the peak level of 91.7 +/- 3.3 ng/ml was achieved at 30 min, with a subsequent half-life of about 1 h). The radioiodine uptake by newborn rat thyroid transplants in the sialoadenectomized and sham-operated animals correlated inversely with the circulating EGF levels determined when the mice were killed (r = -0.99). Low-dose TSH treatment (0.1 microU/day) generally stimulated the radioiodine uptake, but high-dose TSH groups (100 microU/day) were not significantly different from the control group. The 5-day nuclear [3H]thymidine labeling index was 6.8 +/- 0.5% IN newborn rat thyroid transplants grown in sialoadenectomized animals, 13.1 +/- 0.3% in sham-operated animals, and 16.8 +/- 0.5% in nude mice receiving 5 micrograms EGF ip daily. In general, both low-dose and high-dose TSH promoted DNA synthesis under low EGF conditions but were ineffective in the presence of higher levels of EGF. Adult rat thyroid transplants showed no significant responses. Although sialoadenectomy may alter other factors besides EGF, it appears that changes in the levels of circulating EGF within the physiological range affect the function and growth of newborn rat thyroid transplants. Circulating EGF may play a role in thyroid maturation and may also be involved in the regulation of thyroid function throughout life.\r"

[3H]OT was bound with higher affinity than [3H]AVP by both tissues; the mean dissociation constants (KdS) were 0.95 x 10(-9) M and 1.56 x 10(-9) M for OT and AVP, respectively, P less than 0.0001, with no significant variations in the KdS during the cycle. The concentration of [3H]OT binding sites was on the average 50% higher than [3H]AVP across the cycle in both tissues. Endometrial receptor levels varied significantly during the cycle; it was lowest on days 7 and 14, rose significantly on day 17, and peaked on day 21. Myometrial receptor levels decreased from levels at estrus on days 7 and 14, but the changes were not significant. The ratio between endometrial and myometrial receptor concentrations changed from about 10 at estrus to less than 1 in the luteal phase. In early pregnancy, the receptor levels did not differ from nonpregnant levels on days 7 and 14, but on day 17 the endometrial receptor concentrations were significantly lower, and on day 21 those in both tissues were significantly lower. The endometrial OT and AVP receptor concentrations were inversely correlated with plasma progesterone levels (P = 0.005) with no correlation to plasma estradiol, whereas the myometrial receptor concentrations showed no correlation to plasma progesterone but an inverse correlation with plasma estradiol (P = 0.004). We conclude that the endometrial OT and AVP receptor concentrations are more tightly controlled by progesterone than myometrium, and that the bovine conceptus suppresses endometrial OT and AVP receptor concentrations in the preattachment stage either by a local action on the endometrium or indirectly via an antiluteolytic effect.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that human decidual explants synthesize a 25,272 dalton form of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-1) that is identical to the most abundant form of IGFBP detected in human amniotic fluid. To determine whether decidual cells also secrete other structurally distinct forms of IGFBP, conditioned medium obtained from human decidual cells was analyzed by ligand blotting and immunoblotting using antisera that were specific for IGFBP-1 or 2. IGFBP-2 is a form of binding protein that is structurally distinct from IGFBP-1. Ligand blotting analysis (which detects all forms of IGFBPs) showed that 3 forms of IGFBP with Mr estimates of 34,000, 30,000 and 24,000 were present in basal, unstimulated, conditioned media. Immunoblotting showed that the 30,000 Mr form reacted with an antibody that is specific for IGFBP-1, whereas the 34,000 Mr form reacted with an antibody that is specific for IGFBP-2. The 24,000 Mr band did not react with antisera to either IGFBP-1 or 2. Basal IGFBP-1 release from human decidual cultures, as measured by RIA, showed a significant decrease during the 5 day period from 34 +/- 1.6 on day 1 to 12 +/- 1.9 ng/ml on day 5. Exposure of the cells to (Bu)2cAMP (1.0 mM) for 5 days had no significant effect on IGFBP-1 release during the first day of exposure, but caused a progressive stimulation of release during the subsequent 4 days. By day 5, exposure to (Bu)2cAMP induced a 5- to 6-fold increase in IGFBP-1 release that was completely inhibited by exposure to cycloheximide. Exposure of the cells to cholera toxin (0.1 micrograms/ml) for 4 days caused a 3.7-fold increase in IGFBP-1 release. The stimulation of IGFBP-1 release by (Bu)2cAMP was completely inhibited by simultaneous exposure to insulin (100 ng/ml) and/or IGF-I (100 ng/ml) (day 5 control = 35 ng/ml, (Bu)2cAMP alone = 248 ng/ml, insulin + (Bu)2cAMP = 36 ng/ml, or IGF-I + (Bu)2cAMP = 10.1 ng/ml). Hydrocortisone and the phorbol ester (phorbol myristate acetate) caused no significant changes in basal IGFBP-1 release but prevented the decrease in the basal rate of release that occurred between day 1 and 5. Ligand blotting studies showed that the 24,000 Mr form of binding protein was also stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP (3.3-fold increase); however, cholera toxin and phorbol myristate acetate were without effect. In contrast, the release of the 34,000 Mr form was unaffected by exposure to any of these agents, suggesting that regulation of this form of IGFBP is distinct from the other 2 forms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The present study evaluated whether this could be due to a direct, specific inhibitory effect on the zona glomerulosa related to the magnitude of the decrease in oxygen (O2). Bovine adrenocortical cells were dispersed with collagenase and studied in vitro within 48 h. Cells were stimulated for 2 h with ANG II (0.1-1000 nM) or (Bu)2cAMP (0.3-3 mM) under oxygen levels ranging from 0 to 100% O2 (PO2 from 66 +/- 4 to 561 +/- 46 torr) vs. a reference gas mixture (21% O2 PO2 approximately 140 torr). Exposure to 123 +/- 8, 110 +/- 12, 100 +/- 16, and 66 +/- 4 torr led to 27%, 30%, 40% and 70% inhibition, respectively, of 3 nM ANG II-stimulated aldosterone secretion as compared to 140 +/- 16 torr (reference). Exposure to hyperoxia (288 +/- 36 to 561 +/- 46 torr) led to a small (10%) increase in ANG II-stimulated aldosterone secretion which was not statistically significant. The P50 (half-maximal PO2) for aldosteronogenesis was approximately 95 torr. The results for other doses of ANG II and for cAMP were similar. The inhibitory effect of low O2 was reversed by returning the cells to reference conditions (140 +/- 16 torr). Cortisol secretion was not significantly affected by changes in oxygen tension. We conclude that small changes in O2 within the physiological range directly and specifically inhibit aldosteronogenesis in a dose-dependent manner with a P50 of approximately 95 torr. Inhibition of cAMP-stimulated aldosterone secretion suggests a postreceptor site of action. This direct, reversible, and specific effect on the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex may account for the dissociation of renin and aldosterone during hypoxia in vivo.\r"

The three intermediate metabolites, 1 alpha,25(R)26(OH)3D3, 1 alpha,23(S)25(R)26(OH)4D3, and 23(S)25(R)-1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactol, stimulated increases, as did 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, in intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium level in vitamin D-deficient rats fed a low-calcium diet. On the other hand, 23(S)25(R)-1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone increased the calcium transport but decreased the serum calcium level. 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3,23(S)25(R)-Lactone and the other three metabolites stimulated multinucleate cell formation from hematopoietic blast cells in a manner correlated with their binding affinities for the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 receptor. But 23(S)25(R)-lactone did not show any inhibitory effect on the multinucleate cell formation induced by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in contrast to the results obtained from unfractionated marrow cultures. Conditioned medium obtained from 23(S)25(R)-lactone-treated MC3T3-E1 cells inhibited the formation, probably by the action of some inhibitory factors elaborated by the cells treated with the lactone, whereas conditioned medium obtained from 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 or other metabolite-treated MC3T3-E1 cells stimulated the formation. These findings suggest that 23(S)25(R)-1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone might inhibit bone resorption through an inhibition of osteoclastic cell formation and that other vitamin D3 metabolites stimulate bone resorption by development of new osteoclastic cells in addition to indirect osteoclast activation.\r"

By Northern blot analysis the rPL-I cDNA clone hybridizes to a 1.0-kilobase placental mRNA and appears as early as day 10 of gestation. Maximal expression of this mRNA was observed in day 11 and 12 placenta, and faint hybridization of the rPL-I cDNA was also detected in day 18 to term placenta. In contrast, the mouse clone hybridized to mRNA for mouse PL-I (mPL-I) only in day 10 mouse placenta (9). In vitro translation of rPL-I mRNA produced by transcription of the cDNA template yielded a 27-kDa polypeptide the size of the expected precursor protein which was immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody to rPL-I. The rPL-I cDNA nucleotide sequence has been determined. The sequence is very similar to that for mPL-I and contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 230 amino acids compared to 224 for mPL-I. Comparison of the predicted primary translation product of rPL-I mRNA with that of mPL-I mRNA revealed that rPL-I shares 73% identity to mPL-I at the amino acid level. The predicted rPL-I protein shares 41% amino acid identity with rPL-II precursor, 24% with rat prolactin-like protein A, 26% with rat prolactin-like protein B, and 31% with rat PRL. In situ hybridization studies indicated that mRNA for rPL-I was present in a few rapidly dividing cells as early as day 8 of gestation, and by day 9 could be localized to giant cells which surround the conceptus.\r"

NPY-containing neurons project from the hypothalmic arcuate nucleus to the paraventricular nucleus, an area known to be sensitive to the orexigenic effects of NPY. In this study we investigated the possibility that preproNPY messenger RNA (mRNA) content may be altered in obese Zucker rats compared to that of their lean littermates. Total RNA was isolated from hypothalamic dissections from male and female, obese and lean Zucker rats. RNA was also isolated from dissections of: olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of female obese and lean rats. PreproNPY mRNA content was determined by solution hybridization-RNase protection analysis. The results revealed a 2- to 3-fold increase in preproNPY mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of obese animals compared to lean. The increase was observed in both sexes and was specific to the hypothalamus. In situ hybridization localized this increase to the arcuate nucleus. An additional RNase protection study was pursued to investigate the effects of 72 h food deprivation on hypothalamic preproNPY mRNA levels in lean and obese animals. Lean animals displayed an approximate 2-fold increase in preproNPY mRNA content, whereas obese animals showed no significant increase after food deprivation. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that NPY projections within the hypothalamus are involved in regulating feeding behavior and weight gain, and that disturbed regulation of hypothalamic NPY expression may play a role in the etiology of obesity in the genetically obese Zucker rat.\r"

  ".W": "De novo synthesis of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels are suppressed in the presence of cholesterol. Recent evidence suggests that a cholesterol metabolite (possibly a hydroxysterol), not cholesterol per se, is the effector that inhibits transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in sterol synthesis and LDL receptors. We found that 26-hydroxycholesterol inhibits human ovarian cell sterol synthesis, and that luteinized human granulosa cells contain 26-hydroxylase messenger RNA (mRNA). We proceeded to characterize the enzyme generating 26-hydroxycholesterol in the rat ovary. Mitochondria derived from ovaries of PMSG-human CG (hCG) primed immature rats (day 3 post-hCG) metabolized [3H] cholesterol into [3H]26-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and aminoglutethimide (100 micrograms/ml), added to inhibit metabolism of sterols by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage system. The identity of the product was confirmed by chromatography in several systems; recrystallization to constant specific activity and mass spectrometry. Negligible 26-hydroxylase activity was detected in other ovarian subcellular fractions. 26-Hydroxycholesterol formation progressed at a linear rate for up to 40 min and was linearly related to mitochondrial protein added to the incubation mixture. 26-Hydroxylase was markedly stimulated (5-fold) by calcium (0.2 mM). Maximal rates of 26-hydroxycholesterol formation observed were 1 pmol/min.mg protein. This activity is substantially lower than cholesterol side-chain cleavage measured in the absence of aminoglutethimide. Ketoconazole (1-100 microM) inhibited 26-hydroxylase in a dose-dependent manner. Pregnenolone (1-1000 microM) and progesterone (1-100 microM) inhibited 26-hydroxylase in a dose-dependent manner, with appreciable inhibitory effects in the 1-10 microM range. We suggest that 26-hydroxycholesterol is an intracrine regulator that controls cellular sterol metabolism. Formation of 26-hydroxcholesterol in ovarian cells may be regulated by steroidogenic activity in such a way as to ensure availability of steroid hormone precursors. When steroidogenesis is active, 26-hydroxylase is inhibited by products of the side-chain cleavage system, allowing increased de novo sterol synthesis and LDL uptake. With reduced steroidogenic activity and less demand for cholesterol, 26-hydroxylase is not blocked, permitting formation of 26-hydroxycholesterol with attendant reduction in sterol synthesis and LDL receptor gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Stage synchronization of seminiferous epithelium after withdrawal and replenishment of vitamin A provides a valuable and powerful approach to the investigation of paracrine interactions within the testis. However, since the discovery of this model, little attention has been given to the events surrounding the synchronous reinitiation of spermatogenesis after depletion of vitamin A. Synchronization of spermatogenesis was observed in all animals previously deficient in vitamin A. However, the degree of synchrony observed, as assessed by a ratio of synchrony, decreased markedly with time. The possibility that spermatogenic synchrony decreases with time due to variability of the temporal duration of stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is supported by this observation. However, long-term studies are required to substantiate this point. After initiation of stage synchrony of spermatogenesis, increased testicular concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) were observed in testes synchronized between stages IX-II than at other stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. This elevation in testicular EGF concentrations correlated well with mitotic division of type A spermatogonia at stages IX, XII, and XIV of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Previous in vitro studies have implicated an EGF-like factor in the stimulation of type A spermatogonial division in the mouse. A significant increase in testicular insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations was observed in control animals 14 days after the injection of retinol acetate. In vitamin A deficient animals, a marked increase in testicular IGF-I concentrations was observed as compared to age-matched controls. Maximal levels of testicular IGF-I concentrations were present 14 and 28 days and again 126 days after re-supplementation with retinol acetate. No stage dependent changes in testicular IGF-I were observed but the data provided suggest the retinol may be one of the factors involved in the regulation of testicular IGF-I.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that conscious adrenalectomized rats exhibit nearly normal recovery of arterial blood pressure during the 5 h after hemorrhage. In those experiments, it appeared that a previous reduction in food intake might have compromised the recovery of blood pressure and increased mortality. These experiments were designed to test in conscious sham-adrenalectomized (control) and adrenalectomized rats prepared with indwelling arterial and venous cannulae 1) the effects of a 20- to 24-h fast (compared to rats fed ab libitum) on the mobilization of plasma substrates and recovery of arterial blood pressure after a 15 ml/kg.5 min hemorrhage, and 2) vascular responsivity to pressor agents in fed or fasted groups before or 2 h after hemorrhage. In all rats hemorrhage resulted in decreased arterial pressure and heart rate. Arterial pressure recovered to near normal in both fed and fasted control groups and in the fed adrenalectomized rats, and all of these rats survived for 24 h after stress. By contrast, in the fasted adrenalectomized rats, arterial pressure recovered only during the first 1.5-2 h and then failed, resulting in 100% mortality by 3-5 h. Compared to the other three groups, in which substrate levels either increased or remained fairly stable, plasma glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations fell steadily from 1.5-2 h after hemorrhage until death occurred in the fasted adrenalectomized rats. Basal ACTH concentrations were elevated compared to control values in both adrenalectomized groups (fed and fasted). Hemorrhage caused increases in plasma ACTH in all groups; the magnitude of the responses did not differ among the groups. The dilution of Evans' blue dye after hemorrhage (used as an index of fluid movement into the vascular space) was not different in control and adrenalectomized rats (either fed or fasted). There were no differences in pressor responses to phenylephrine, vasopressin, or angiotensin-II between the fed and fasted conditions in the control rats either before or after hemorrhage. There was a fasting-associated decrease in vascular responsivity to vasopressin, but normal responsivity to phenylephrine and angiotensin-II, in the adrenalectomized rats both before and after hemorrhage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fed adrenalectomized rats survive the stress of hemorrhage and hypovolemia, whereas fasted adrenalectomized rats become hypotensive and hypoglycemic after the first 90 min and die within 4 h. We have studied the effects of glucose and corticosterone (B) infusions after hemorrhage as well as treatment with B at the time of adrenalectomy on the capacity of chronically prepared, conscious, fasted, adrenalectomized rats to survive hemorrhage. We have also measured the magnitudes of vasoactive hormone responses to hemorrhage. Maintenance of plasma glucose concentrations did not sustain life; however, treatment of rats at the time of adrenalectomy with B allowed 100% survival, and acute treatment of adrenalectomized rats at the time of hemorrhage allowed about 50% survival during the 5-h posthemorrhage observation period. Rats in the acute B infusion group that died exhibited significantly increased plasma B and significantly decreased plasma glucose concentrations by 2 h compared to the rats that lived. Plasma vasopressin, renin, and norepinephrine responses to hemorrhage were markedly augmented in the adrenalectomized rats not treated with B, and plasma vasopressin concentrations were significantly elevated at 1 and 2 h in all of the rats that subsequently died compared to values in those that lived. We conclude that: 1) death after hemorrhage in fasted adrenalectomized rats is not a result of lack of glucose; 2) chronic and, to an extent, acute treatment of fasted adrenalectomized rats with B enables survival; 3) fasted adrenalectomized rats exhibit strong evidence of hepatic insufficiency which is not apparent in either fed adrenalectomized rats or B-treated fasted adrenalectomized rats; 4) death after hemorrhage in fasted adrenalectomized rats may result from hepatic failure as a consequence of marked splanchnic vasoconstriction mediated by the actions of extraordinarily high levels of vasoactive hormones after hemorrhage; and 5) B appears to act to decrease the magnitude of response of vasoactive hormones after hemorrhage in fasted adrenalectomized rats.\r"

We have examined the IGFBPs secreted by monolayer cultures of neonatal fibroblasts by ligand blotting with [125I]IGF-II and immunoblotting with antisera raised against three well characterized IGFBPs: IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3. As detected by ligand blotting, medium from untreated fibroblasts contained IGFBP-3, a second IGFBP which appeared as a doublet of 29-31 K, and a smaller protein of 22 K. Within 10 h of the addition of 50 ng/ml IGF-I, a markedly increased level of production of the 29-31 K IGFBP doublet was detectable, with levels increasing 8- to 9-fold by 24 h compared to that in untreated samples. IGF-I was approximately twice as potent as IGF-II at inducing 29-31 K IGFBP, with a half-maximal response at 15.4 +/- 2.7 ng/ml IGF-I and 26.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml IGF-II (n = 3). Insulin tested at 1 microgram/ml did not induce 29-31 K IGFBP. Neither GH nor the acid-labile subunit of the circulating high mol wt IGFBP complex induced 29-31 K IGFBP or affected its induction by IGF-I or IGF-II. Immunoblotting demonstrated that IGF-inducible IGFBP did not react with antibodies to IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, or IGFBP-3. These results indicate that IGF-I and IGF-II induce an IGFBP that is different from previously characterized human IGFBPs.\r"

  ".W": "We recently identified a 32 K mol wt insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein (BP) which is markedly increased in the serum of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and recognized by antiserum against the human amniotic fluid IGFBP (hIGFBP-1). In the present study we sought to confirm that this protein represents the rat homolog of IGFBP-1 (rIGFBP-1), and that rIGFBP-1 may, therefore, play an important role in the regulation of IGF bioactivity in experimental diabetes. Since the abundance of related hepatic mRNA is high in diabetic rats, we asked whether well differentiated H4EIIC3 rat hepatoma cells produce rIGFBP-1 and provide sufficient amounts of this protein for purification and further characterization. Specific IGF-binding activity in hepatoma conditioned medium was detected initially by incubation with 125I-labeled recombinant human IGF-II and precipitation with polyethylene glycol. Ligand blotting demonstrated a 32 K BP, identical in size to the major low mol wt IGFBP found in diabetic rat serum. Affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation confirmed that this BP is related to human IGFBP-1 and is distinct from the fetal rat IGFBP, rIGFBP-2. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into 32 K BPs confirmed synthesis by hepatoma cells. For purification of BPs, conditioned medium was collected in roller culture, and BPs were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-75 chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC. Partial amino acid sequencing of purified protein demonstrated 68% identity with the human IGFBP-1 and distinguished this BP from previously characterized rat IGFBPs. Purified protein bound both IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity. We conclude that the 32 K IGFBP produced by H4EIIC3 hepatoma cells in culture represents the rat form of IGFBP-1 (rIGFBP-1). Regulation of rIGFBP-1 may play an important role in the modulation of IGF bioactivity in experimental animals with metabolic disease. The availability of purified rIGFBP-1 and identification of a cell line that produces this BP will greatly facilitate future studies of IGFBP-1 in the rat model.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are bound in the circulation to specific binding proteins (BP). The predominant BP is a GH-dependent glycosylated protein of 42-49 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BP-3), whereas nonglycosylated GH-independent IGFBPs of 32 kDa and less are minor constituents. Primary cultures of rat osteoblastic cells constitutively produce IGFBP species of 32 kDa, while GH induces the accumulation of BP-3. To examine whether BP-3 could regulate the biological activity of IGF-I on osteoblasts, we compared the effects of recombinant native human IGF-I (hIGF-I) on primary cultures of osteoblasts in the presence and absence of GH. hIGF-I stimulated cell replication and alpha 1(I) collagen gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, and these effects were potentiated by the presence of GH, which increased the accumulation of BP-3. To further examine this correlation, we compared the effects of two IGF-I peptides on the osteoblastic cell line PyMS, which constitutively produces BP-3, to those in RCT-3 cells, which do not secrete this IGFBP. Using hIGF-I and [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I ([QAYL]IGF-I), a mutated IGF-I with reduced affinity to IGFBPs, we found that at equimolar concentrations hIGF-I produced higher stimulation than [QAYL]IGF-I on [3H]thymidine incorporation, cell replication, and collagen gene expression in PyMS cells. In contrast, both IGF-I peptides had similar potency in RCT-3 cells. Hence, these data show that the accumulation of BP-3 correlates with enhanced hIGF-I activity on osteoblastic cells, suggesting that BPs may act locally to augment the effects of IGF-I in bone.\r"

  ".W": "The aldosterone secretory response of isolated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells to potassium was studied in a cell-perifusion system. Increasing the potassium concentration from 3.6 to 5.4 mM in the perifusion medium caused a rapid 40-fold stimulation of aldosterone production which was maintained during the 2 h period of stimulation. A dose of 8.4 mM potassium elicited a 100-fold increase of hormone production with rapid onset and a slowly decreasing plateau. When the potassium concentration was further increased to 18 mM, there was a rapid stimulation of aldosterone production comparable to that evoked by 8.4 mM potassium; however, the response declined very rapidly to levels still above basal. The dihydropyridine-agonist BAY-K 8644 (100 nM) greatly enhanced the aldosterone response to 5.4 mM potassium but did not significantly modify the response evoked by 8.4 mM potassium. The effect of BAY-K 8644 on the aldosterone response was inhibitory at 18 mM potassium concentration, suggesting that the character of dihydropyridine modulation of the secretory response was voltage dependent, showing reversal at relatively negative potentials. When the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was monitored in glomerulosa cells by the fluorescent Ca2(+)-probe Fura-2, potassium evoked a rapid dose-dependent increase in free Ca2+, with elevated steady-state Ca2(+)-levels throughout stimulation, even at potassium concentrations higher than 18 mM. Moreover, BAY-K 8644 (100 nM) enhanced the cytoplasmic Ca2+ response to all potassium concentrations tested up to 30 mM. The initial 30 sec 45Ca2+ uptake, an indicator of potassium-stimulated voltage-sensitive Ca2+ influx into these cells, showed a fast increase and only an initial inactivation in response to 18 mM potassium. This response was enhanced by 100 nM BAY-K 8644, with no sign of enhanced inactivation or inhibition caused by the dihydropyridine agonist. These results indicate that the correlation between Ca2+ influx, cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, and the secretory response in adrenal glomerulosa cells is lost at potassium concentrations higher than 8 mM, especially in the presence of the dihydropyridine agonist, BAY-K 8644.\r"

In this study we further investigated B feedback potency on regulation of ACTH by examining 1) the time course of changes in pituitary ACTH secretion and content, plasma B and B-binding globulin (CBG) concentrations, and thymus weight after adrenalectomy (ADX) performed on 5-day-old pups, with or without sc 5% B pellet replacement, and 2) the time required for acute (B injection) and the B dose required for constant (B pellet) inhibition of ACTH secretion in 10-day-old ADX neonates. As in adult rats, ADX in neonates caused an immediate (3 h) large increase (13-fold) in plasma ACTH levels compared to that in sham-operated rats, followed by a decrease by 12 and 24 h after surgery and a further and sustained increase during the next 4 days. Pituitary ACTH stores were diminished in ADX rats by 3, 12, and 24 h and increased thereafter. Five percent B pellet replacement abolished ADX-induced changes in plasma and pituitary ACTH until days 4-5, when plasma ACTH was slowly released from B inhibition (circulating B values were similar to ADX values). By day 10 of life, inhibition of plasma ACTH by calculated free B showed an IC50 of 1.09 nM. Plasma CBG concentrations exhibited a clear developmental pattern in sham-operated rats, being lower on days 6-8 than earlier or later. Typical ADX-induced increases in CBG levels were observed from day 3 on after surgery, at the same time as a transient decrease in CBG levels occurred in ADX plus 5% B rats. On day 10 of age, inhibition of CBG by calculated free B demonstrated an IC50 of 1.5 nM. Although no enlargement of the thymus was observed after neonatal ADX, thymus weight was significantly diminished by 12 h after B replacement and in a dose-related manner at 5 days with B pellets containing 5-25% B. The thymus contained mostly type II glucocorticoid receptors, which did not up-regulate 3 h or 5 days after ADX. Acute sc injection of B (10-34 micrograms/g BW) in 10-day-old rats inhibited ADX-induced ACTH secretion within 30 min, and the estimated half-time for the inhibition was 40 min. By 2 h after B injection, plasma ACTH levels were comparable to those in sham-operated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90322929\r", 
  ".W": "Previous investigations have established that hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mice exhibit diminished PTH/cAMP stimulation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)-1-hydroxylase activity in the renal proximal convoluted tubule. Whether similar muted enzyme responsiveness occurs secondary to provocation by other hormones/metabolic factors that operate by a different mechanism in the same cell system, however, remains unknown. In order to investigate this possibility, we compared renal 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase activity of normal and Hyp mice upon stimulation with PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), a factor which may affect enzyme function in the PCT by a PTH-independent mechanism. Administration of 1-34 PTHrP, 3.0 micrograms/day sc, increased enzyme activity in normal mice (4.9 + 0.63 vs. 50.3 +/- 6.2 fmol/mg kidney.min) to a level significantly greater than that achieved in the Hyp mice (6.9 + 0.86 vs. 14.5 +/- 0.91 fmol/mg kidney.min). Moreover, similar to our observations after PTH stimulation, abnormal PTHrP effects did not result from an altered time course of enzyme activation or a shift in the dose response. Thus, the 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase activity increased linearly to a maximum at 24 h in both animal models with a slope greater in normals than in mutants (P less than 0.05). Further, administration of PTHrP in graded amounts (0-9.0 micrograms/day) elicited a curvilinear response in normals and Hyp mice, but the mutants exhibited significantly less function (54 +/- 8.6%) at all doses tested. Additional studies revealed that the muted effects of PTHrP occurred via a PTH-independent mechanism. In this regard, we observed that simultaneous infusion of maximally effective doses of PTH and PTHrP in normal and Hyp mice resulted in an additive increment of 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase activity. This observation that PTH and PTHrP influence renal 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase by apparently different mechanisms indicates that the muted effects of these agents on enzyme activity in the Hyp-mouse results from a generalized defect in the proximal convoluted tubule.\r"

  ".U": "90322934\r", 
  ".W": "Prolonged sleep deprivation of the rat produces a progressive increase in energy expenditure and an eventual decrease in body temperature, which suggests a profound derangement in thermoregulation. Because increased thermogenic activity in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a likely mechanism mediating the observed increase in energy expenditure, we focused our attention on the effect of total sleep deprivation on BAT type II 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II), since its activation indicates BAT stimulation and is essential for full BAT thermogenic response. Five euthyroid rats were subjected to total (92%) sleep deprivation (euD-rats). Sharing the sleep deprivation apparatus, yoked control rats (euC-rats) received the same degree of physical stimulation as the D-rats, but were only partially (25%) sleep deprived. Additional cage controls (euCC-rats) were housed in the same room. Since during sleep deprivation the animals undergo a reduction in plasma T4 concentration and inability to maintain body temperature heralds death, an identical study was performed in five trios of hyperthyroid rats (hyperD-, hyperC-, and hyper CC-rats) given daily ip injections of 15 micrograms T4/100 g BW, 10 days before and throughout the deprivation period. Experiments were carried out at an ambient temperature of 29 C, close to thermoneutrality for rats. Sleep deprivation in hyperD-rats was maintained until death seemed imminent (9-14 days), and in euD-rats for 12-15 days. Sleep deprivation induced a significant increase in BAT 5'D-II activity in both hyperD- and euD-rats compared with that in euCC-rats (P less than 0.01). BAT 5'D-II in euC-rats was also significantly higher than that in euCC-rats (P less than 0.05), probably because they were partially sleep deprived. BAT 5'D-II activity in hyperD-rats was increased compared to that in both hyperC- and hyperCC-rats (P less than 0.05), in which the activity was slightly but not significantly lower than that in euCC-rats. No significant differences were observed in liver and kidney type I 5'-D (5'D-I) and in pituitary 5'D-II among euD-rats, euC-rats, and euCC-rats. As expected, the hyperthyroid groups (hyperD-rats, hyperC-rats, and hyperCC-rats) had significantly higher kidney 5'D-I and lower pituitary 5'D-II than the euCC-rats. Liver 5'D-I was also significantly increased in the hyperC-rats and hyperCC-rats, but not in the hyperD-rats. These observations indicate that total sleep deprivation is associated with a marked increase in BAT 5'D-II activity in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To study the contact zones of medullary and cortical tissues, porcine adrenals were examined on the histological and ultrastructural levels. Splanchnic nerve activation stimulated in parallel the release of epinephrine (from a basal value of 0.31 +/- 0.11 to 8.13 +/- 0.60 microgram/min) and norepinephrine (from 0.76 +/- 0.68 to 12.94 +/- 3.58 micrograms/min) and the release of the corticosteroids cortisol (from 0.62 +/- 0.19 to 2.00 +/- 0.35 micrograms/min) and aldosterone (from 3.34 +/- 0.59 to 7.53 +/- 1.63 ng sigma in). Also, perfusion of the isolated adrenals with catecholamines provoked a significant release of the corticosteroids. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) stimulated the release of cortisol (from 0.59 +/- 0.31 to 2.66 +/- 0.34 micrograms/min) and aldosterone (from 2.12 +/- 0.42 to 4.68 +/- 0.92 ng/min). Norepinephrine (10(-6) M) stimulated the release of cortisol (from 0.26 +/- 0.07 to 1.28 +/- 0.10 micrograms/min) and aldosterone (from 1.28 +/- 0.37 to 3.57 +/- 0.80 ng/min). Using an immunostaining for synaptophysin, which is specific for neuroendocrine cells, chromaffin cells could be detected within all three zones of the adrenal cortex. The two endocrine tissues appear to be closely interwoven. On the ultrastructural level, medullary cells are in apposition to cortical cells, with close cellular contacts. These results show that the release of corticosteroids cortisol and aldosterone can be stimulated through the sympatho-adrenal system. Taking into consideration the close colocalization of cortical and medullary tissues, this stimulation may be mediated by chromaffin cells in a paracrine manner.\r"

  ".W": "A series of studies was started to gain insight into the functioning of the canine hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis during normo- and hypercortisolemic states. In this first study, we have focused on the binding characteristics of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the brain and pituitary of the adrenalectomized dog. In hippocampal cytosol at 0 C, corticosterone had the highest association rate, followed by cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol had the most rapid rate of dissociation from MR at 0 C (t1/2 = 45.5 h), followed by aldosterone (70.4 h) and corticosterone (102 h). The selective glucocorticoid RU 28362 associated rapidly with hippocampal GR, attaining maximum binding within 4 h, and dissociated with a t1/2 of 34.8 h. Saturation binding of [3H]cortisol in adrenalectomized dog hippocampal cytosol produced a curvilinear Scatchard plot. After inclusion of RU 28362, [3H]cortisol bound solely to MR [dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.34 nM, Bmax = 72.8 fmol/mg]. GR capacity was determined with [3H]RU 28362 (Kd = 0.39 nM, Bmax = 120 fmol/mg). Competition binding analyses of various steroids for MR and GR revealed markedly different patterns of steroid binding specificity for these receptors. The rank order for displacement of [3H]aldosterone binding of MR was: corticosterone greater than aldosterone = cortisol greater than dexamethasone greater than ZK 91587 greater than RU 26752 greater than spironolactone much greater than RU 38486, and for displacement of [3H]RU 28362 binding of GR: RU 28362 much greater than corticosterone = cortisol greater than dexamethasone greater than aldosterone greater than ZK 91587 greater than RU 26752 = RU 38486 much greater than spironolactone. MR was located in all brain regions examined, with highest levels in the septo-hippocampal complex, whereas GR was rather evenly distributed. Substantial amounts of MR and GR were present in the anterior part of the pituitary as well as in the neurointermediate lobe. Our findings show that the ligand binding specificity of canine MR and GR is remarkably different from that of rodent MR and GR, but is similar to that of recombinant-derived human receptors. Spironolactone and RU 38486 are selective antagonists for MR and GR, respectively. In contrast to other species, the dog has relatively large quantities of MR widely distributed in the brain and pituitary, which makes this species an interesting animal model to study the role of corticosteroid receptor diversity in control of homeostasis.\r"

To increase our understanding of the control of follicular dynamics in cattle, the present study was designed to characterize the pattern of follicular development during artificially lengthened estrous cycles. Cycles were lengthened by intravaginal insertion of Silastic devices containing progesterone [Controlled Internal Drug Release devices (CIDRs)]. Control heifers (group 1) received blank devices, whereas treated heifers received one (group 2) or two CIDRs (group 3) from days 14 to 28 after estrus. In groups 2 and 3, the insertion of CIDRs prevented return to estrus at the normal time and increased cycle length as compared to the control group (30.0 +/- 0.0 and 31.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 21.0 +/- 0.7 days, respectively, P less than 0.05). After natural luteolysis and between days 22 and 28 of cycle, progesterone concentrations were maintained at lower levels in group 2 (range = 0.9-2.1 ng/ml) than in group 3 (range = 3.7-4.9 ng/ml, P less than 0.003). Follicular development and regression were monitored daily by ultrasonography. The number of follicular waves per cycle was identical in groups 1 and 2 (2.7 waves per cycle), despite the significantly longer cycles in group 2. In group 2, the presence of one CIDR altered the normal pattern of follicular development by promoting the prolonged growth of the ovulatory follicle, and associated with it, a complete absence of follicular recruitment. When compared to ovulatory follicles in controls (group 1), ovulatory follicles in group 2 were detected on the ovaries for a longer time (1.8-fold), reached a greater maximal size (1.4-fold), and were dominant for a longer time (3-fold). Heifers in group 3 had significantly more follicular waves per cycle than groups 1 and 2 (3.8 vs. 2.7 waves per cycle, respectively, P less than 0.05), due to the production of additional follicular waves during the lengthened cycle in three of six heifers. The other three heifers in group 3 showed patterns of follicular development similar to those of group 2. All heifers in the control group had normal preovulatory rises in estradiol and LH. During the period of treatment (days 14-28), 17 beta-estradiol concentrations were higher in heifers in group 2 (lower progesterone levels) than in heifers in group 3 (higher progesterone levels; P less than 0.0001). No differences were observed in basal LH concentrations between groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To test OT's potential role as a regulator of follicular steroidogenesis, theca and granulosa cells were isolated from bovine preovulatory follicles 48 h after initiation of luteolysis with prostaglandin F2 alpha, and cultured with graded doses of OT (0, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mIU/ml). Granulosa cells were cultured with testosterone (0.5 microM) in either defined medium or medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of FSH (300 ng/ml); medium was collected and replaced daily for 5 days. In defined medium, oxytocin alone significantly increased progesterone production by granulosa cells (P less than 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner; over 5 days, doses of 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mIU/ml OT caused 1.7-, 2.0-, 2.2-, and 2.6-fold increases. FSH enhanced progesterone 5-fold, but no dose of OT increased progesterone in the presence of FSH. OT also elevated progesterone in serum-containing medium (P less than 0.005), but the magnitude of its effects was lower (1.07-, 1.1-, 1.2-, and 1.4-fold increases with 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mIU/ml OT). OT had little effect on estradiol secretion by granulosa cells cultured with or without FSH. To test the specificity of OT's effects on progesterone production by granulosa cells, granulosa cells were treated with graded doses of an OT antagonist (0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of OT (5 and 50 mIU/ml). Progesterone production by granulosa cells in the presence of the antagonist alone was similar to production in control cultures. The stimulatory effects of 5 and 50 mIU OT were completely abolished in the presence of 100 or 1000 ng antagonist, respectively (P less than 0.01). Preparations of theca interna were cultured in defined medium with graded doses of OT (0, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mIU/ml) in the presence or absence of LH (300 ng/ml), with collection and replacement of medium at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. LH alone increased both progesterone (12-fold) and androstenedione (4-fold) production over controls. However, no dose of OT significantly affected either progesterone or androstenedione production. These results show that OT stimulates progesterone production by granulosa cells, and thus, suggest that OT regulates steroidogenesis in bovine granulosa cells in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously identified the peptide-YY (PYY) receptor on porcine brain membranes as a 50-kDa protein after chemical cross-linking. PYY receptors are discretely distributed in the brain of various mammals, to which neuropeptide-Y (NPY), but not pancreatic polypeptide (PP), bind with great specificity. The present study was carried out in order 1) to identify and characterize the PYY receptor in the avian brain, 2) to compare it with the APP receptor that had been demonstrated in the cerebellum, and 3) to examine [125I]APP-binding activity in the porcine brain. [125I]PYY was bound to chicken brain membranes via high affinity (Kd = 2.19 x 10(-10) M) and low affinity (Kd = 1.93 x 10(-7) M) components. The binding sites were highly specific for PYY and APP as well as for NPY and PPP, coupled to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, and distributed in various brain areas, including the cerebellum. The C-terminal fragments of PYY, PYY-(17-36) and PYY-(24-36), exhibited low potency in inhibiting binding, but behaved like full agonists. Porcine brain membranes, on the other hand, possessed two orders of the APP-binding sites, a high affinity component (Kd = 4.24 x 10(-9) M) and a low affinity component (Kd = 3.08 x 10(-7) M). APP binding showed a high specificity for APP, but not for PPP, NPY, or PYY. The binding activity was highest in the pituitary gland, followed by the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, did not inhibit the binding of [125I]APP to porcine or chicken brain membranes, which ran counter to the results of PYY receptors in both species. Cross-linking studies have demonstrated that receptor-bound [125I]APP is cross-linked to a protein of 67 kDa without disulfide-linked subunits in both porcine and chicken brain membranes. In the latter species, [125I]PYY and [125I]NPY were also cross-linked to the same 67-kDa proteins, which were different from the receptor proteins (50 kDa) in mammalian species. These results indicate that chicken brain has receptors specific for PYY and NPY, as was found in mammalian brains, and that PYY, NPY, and PP act in the brain through interaction at multiple receptor sites, which are similar to and shared by other members of the PP family. Furthermore, the finding that APP-binding sites in porcine brain are more specific than those in avian brain suggests that an endogenous peptide similar to APP may exist in porcine brain.\r"

  ".W": "1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3) is a known up-regulator of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) both in vitro and in vivo. However, a 5- to 10-fold increase in plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 induced by dietary calcium deficiency does not result in up-regulation of intestinal VDR, and kidney VDR is down-regulated. Under certain physiological stresses, an increase in plasma PTH precedes increased plasma 1,25(OH)2D3. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of PTH on VDR regulation in vitro in ROS 17/2.8 cells and in vivo in male Holtzman rats. Treatment of ROS cells with PTH (0-5 nM) resulted in a dose and time-dependent decline in VDR from 95 +/- 9 to 35 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein at 18 h of exposure. The ED50 for PTH was 1 nM. This decline in VDR protein was attended by a 50% decline in VDR messenger RNA (mRNA). The PTH-mediated down-regulation of VDR occurred without affecting the affinity of VDR for 1,25(OH)2D3 as determined by Scatchard analysis. Also, the effect of PTH on VDR regulation was specific since cell glucocorticoid receptor concentration was not affected by PTH treatment. In accompanying experiments, 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 treatment of ROS cells was shown to result in a 3- to 4-fold increased expression of VDR and VDR mRNA. The simultaneous addition of PTH and 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 resulted in inhibition of the 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3-mediated up-regulation of VDR and VDR mRNA. Similarly, PTH also inhibited heterologous up-regulation of VDR and VDR mRNA induced by retinoic acid. In in vivo experiments, rats infused for 5 days with 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.5 ng/h) increased their expression of intestinal VDR, kidney VDR, and kidney 24-hydroxylase by 31, 336, and 4000%, respectively. Coinfusion of PTH (1.8 IU/h) along with 1,25(OH)2D3 completely inhibited the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated increases in intestinal VDR and kidney 24-hydroxylase and reduced the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated up-regulation of kidney VDR by more than half. These data suggest that PTH is a potent down-regulator of VDR and that PTH and 1,25(OH)2D3 have opposing effects on the expression of certain genes.\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular hyposmolarity is a potent direct stimulus for hormone secretion for which a mechanism has not been delineated. The importance of plasmalemma Ca2+ permeability in this phenomenon in pituitary tumor-derived GH4C1 cells was evaluated by comparing the dynamics of changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) with those of PRL secretion. At a normal physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (1.5 mM), hyposmolarity induced a striking rise in both [Ca2+]i and PRL secretion, which was proportional to the stimulus between 0.50% reduction in medium osmolarity. Thirty percent hyposmolarity induced a 3-fold rise in [Ca2+]i and a 5-fold rise in PRL secretion above the basal level. These effects did not occur in cells incubated in a medium with a Ca2+ concentration lower than 30 microM. In cells incubated in 1.5 mM Ca2+, the Ca2(+)-channel antagonists, nifedipine and verapamil, significantly inhibited hyposmolar-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and PRL secretion. These data suggest that in GH4C1 cells medium hyposmolarity causes a burst of PRL secretion that depends on a similar preceding rise in [Ca2+]i produced by extracellular Ca2+ influx, most of which passes through dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2(+)-channels.\r"

Although all but one of the evaluated features of myelinated and unmyelinated fiber pathology could be found in every diabetic patient, certain myelinated fiber abnormalities were associated with the clinical characteristics of the neuropathy. Thus, myelinated fiber density was severely reduced, \"empty\" Schwann tubes (an index of myelinated fiber degeneration) were increased, and early regeneration (bands of Bungner [BB], nonmyelinated axons) was pronounced in the RFU group. Progression from BB to regenerating myelinated fiber cluster (myelination and maturation) was more successful in patients with CPN and NPN than in those with RFU, and the finding of fibers with disproportionately large Schwann cells (cytoplasm and myelin) relative to axon caliber was exclusive to patients with neuropathic pain. We concluded that 1) unequal rates of successful fiber regeneration may underlie the apparent difference in the extent of myelinated fiber loss between painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy; 2) myelinated and unmyelinated fiber degeneration and regeneration per se are probably not the cause of neuropathic pain in diabetic polyneuropathy, because each occurred in patients with RFU; and 3) axonal atrophy may be involved in neuropathic pain generation.\r"

Comparisons were made with age-matched nondiabetic control subjects. The diabetic groups showed no abnormality in capillary density or mean endoneurial area per fascicle. Compared with control subjects, all diabetic patients had an increase in mean capillary diameter, capillary wall thickness, and outer tunic (basement membrane and pericytes) thickness. The increase in wall thickness was most pronounced in patients with painless neuropathy (200%) and less marked in similar patients with painful neuropathy (100%). The pericyte volume fraction of the outer tunic was reduced in all diabetic patients, implying that basement membrane hypertrophy and reduplication were responsible for outer tunic thickening. There was evidence of endothelial cell hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy. There was a correlation between the degree of basement membrane thickening and the severity of myelinated fiber abnormality assessed neurophysiologically and morphologically. This study shows a link between the degree of endoneurial capillary basement membrane thickening, the type of neuropathology, and the clinical expression of neuropathy in diabetes mellitus.\r"

Radiolabeled albumin-bound AA was administered into the maternal afferent circulation, and samples of fetal and maternal effluent were collected at 10-min intervals. Perfused placental tissue was collected at the end of each experiment. The effluent was analyzed for total radioactivity, and extracts were subjected to thin-layer chromatography for the assessment of radioactivity associated with various lipid fractions. Placental AA uptake was significantly increased in perfused tissue from diabetic pregnancies (0.88 vs. 1.72 nM.min-1.g-1 in nondiabetic and IDDM, respectively; P less than 0.01), as was AA transfer (0.22 vs. 0.42 ml/min in nondiabetic and IDDM, respectively; P less than 0.01). However, transfer of the highly diffusible marker substance antipyrine was significantly reduced in IDDM placentas (1.79 vs. 2.49 ml/min in IDDM and nondiabetic, respectively; P less than 0.01). Compared with nondiabetic placentas, incorporation of AA into triglyceride was significantly increased in both maternal and fetal effluents and in placental tissue from IDDM pregnancies, whereas the percentage of AA remaining unesterified was reduced in both placental tissue and fetal effluent. Incorporation of AA into phosphoglycerides was significantly reduced in placental tissue but increased in fetal effluent in placentas from IDDM pregnancies. The results of these studies suggest that transfer and lipid distribution of AA are significantly altered in placentas from IDDM pregnancies. These findings may be relevant to the increased incidence of abnormal fetal growth and development associated with IDDM pregnancies.\r"

  ".W": "Alteration in transcapillary albumin escape rate (TERalb) is an indicator of changes in macromolecular movement at the capillary filtering bed, which can change the balance of Starling forces for fluid movement from the vasculature to the interstitium and has an impact on volume homeostasis. TERalb can be affected by morphological changes in the capillary membrane and/or alterations in the Starling forces driving larger solutes across the capillary membrane via convection. Previous studies have demonstrated an increased TERalb in established insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM); however, whether increased TERalb is the result of morphological alterations in the microvasculature or contributes to microangiopathies could not be resolved. TERalb was examined in awake Wistar rats with untreated IDDM induced by streptozocin infusion (65 mg/kg body wt i.v.) at 24 h and 7 and 15 days and compared with control and insulin-treated 7-day IDDM rats. Increased TERalb occurred at the 24-h time point and remained elevated at 7 and 15 days of IDDM (P less than 0.05). Blood volume remained unchanged; however, systemic protein concentration increased from 4.9 +/- 0.1 g/dl in controls to 6.4 +/- 0.4 g/dl in 15-day IDDM rats. Blood glucose was significantly increased, and glycosuria was evident at all three time points of IDDM. The observed increase in TERalb within 24 h of IDDM is indicative of a functional change in the Starling forces in the capillaries, because specific morphological capillary damage is not evident at this time point in the model. The early onset of TERalb in IDDM could indicate functional changes, such as capillary hypertension, and may contribute to future vascular complications in established IDDM.\r"

The mean preexercise tcPO2 level was comparable in these four groups. However, tcPO2 decreased significantly with exercise in feet with PIVD (mean +/- SE -17.9 +/- 2.7%, P less than 0.01, n = 11), regardless of presence or absence of vascular calcification. On the other hand, the value increased significantly with exercise in feet with MAC but without PIVD (21.2 +/- 3.5%, P less than 0.01, n = 10) and in those of diabetic control subjects (14.9 +/- 3.6%, P less than 0.01), respectively.

In this study, fasting plasma TM concentrations in 67 diabetic patients with different degrees of albuminuria (39 men aged 57 +/- 8 yr, 28 women aged 57 +/- 11 yr; means +/- SD) and 34 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were investigated by use of a one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay, a new method developed by H.I. and others.

Group 1 diabetic rats received daily insulin to maintain blood glucose levels at 300-400 mg/dl for 44 wk. Group 2 diabetic rats received the same insulin regimen for 37 wk and then received an increased dose of insulin to return blood glucose levels close to normal for 7 wk. Group 3 nondiabetic rats were age-matched controls. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney weight were elevated in moderately hyperglycemic group 1 rats compared with group 3 rats. Normalization of blood glucose returned both GFR (group 1, 1.83 +/- 0.04 ml/min; group 2, 1.36 +/- 0.05 ml/min; group 3, 1.45 +/- 0.07 ml/min) and kidney weight (group 1, 2.55 +/- 0.06 g; group 2, 1.82 +/- 0.05 g; group 3, 1.72 +/- 0.06 g) to normal in group 2 rats. Despite a sustained increase in GFR, group 1 rats did not exhibit any increase in glomerular volume (group 1, 2.77 +/- 0.09 x 10(6) microns3; group 2, 2.69 +/- 0.09 x 10(6) microns3; group 3, 2.81 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) microns3).

These findings show that normalization of blood glucose can reverse established glomerular hyperfiltration and renal hypertrophy in moderately hyperglycemic diabetic rats.

The endogenous substrate oxidation was also calculated by measuring urinary nitrogen excretion. The energy production rate was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls. The origins of liver disease and the degree of liver damage did not seem to influence the energy production rate. On the other hand, in cirrhotic patients, as in controls, a significant correlation was present between the energy production rate and parameters of body size, such as body weight and fat-free mass. As a consequence, cirrhotic patients with poor nutritional status, with a reduced fat-free mass, showed a lower energy production rate. The measured energy production rate was compared with the resting energy expenditure estimated by formulas commonly used in healthy individuals. The good agreement found between the measured energy production rate and calculated energy expenditure suggests that these formulas may be applied to stable cirrhotic patients in clinical practice. In cirrhotic patients, the oxidation of endogenous fat is the main contributor to basal energy production rate. The fat oxidation rate does not appear to be influenced by the hormonal pattern found in the cirrhotic patients. However, a significant correlation was present between fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid levels. This confirms that the prevalent fat use in cirrhotic patients is supported by the greater availability of fat-derived substrates.\r"

To evaluate whether the specificity of the method could be improved by modifying the labeling position of the tracer, thymidine labeled on its methyl group with 3H and thymidine labeled on its carbon 2 with 14C were injected in 22 hepatectomized rats either 1 hr (when DNA synthesis is not increased) or 24 hr after the surgical procedure (when the rate of DNA synthesis is maximal). Liver samples taken 10, 30 and 120 min after injection showed that, in contrast to 3H-radioactivity, 14C-radioactivity measured in whole tissue allowed a clear discrimination between regenerating and nonregenerating livers. In addition, 14C-radioactivity measured in whole tissue of regenerating livers correlated with the DNA radioactivity 10, 30 and 120 min after injection of the tracer. In contrast, no such correlation was found with the methyl-labeled thymidine. Analysis of the radioactive material present in the non-DNA fraction using ion exchange disks and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that 2-C-labeled thymidine was incorporated into DNA without accumulation of labeled metabolites whereas, for the methyl-labeled thymidine, almost all radioactivity was related to degradative products. Therefore the evaluation of the liver regeneration with the 2-C-labeled thymidine, which does not require cellular fractionation, should be suited for noninvasive measurement with positron emission tomography.\r"

The liver antigen of liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies has been identified as cytochrome P450 db1, a microsomal enzyme catalyzing the oxidative metabolism of more than 20 drugs, including debrisoquine, sparteine and bufuralol. A genetic polymorphism (debrisoquin-sparteine polymorphism) is responsible for the lack of P450 db1 protein in the livers of 5% to 10% of Caucasians, leading to impaired drug metabolism and a distinct poor metabolizer phenotype. We investigated whether liver-kidney microsomal-1 positive autoimmune chronic active hepatitis patients express functionally intact P450 db1 in their livers. In four patients with liver-kidney microsomal-1 positive chronic active hepatitis, but not in five patients with various liver-kidney microsomal-1 negative liver diseases, the presence of circulating liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay and immunoblotting analysis using recombinant P450 db1. Moreover, only sera from liver-kidney microsomal-1 positive autoimmune chronic active hepatitis patients strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity of P450 db1 in human liver microsomes in vitro. Immunoblotting detected 50-kd P450 db1 protein in liver biopsy specimens from all patients. The in vivo function of P450 db1 was investigated by determining the metabolic ratio for sparteine and its 2-dehydro and 5-dehydro metabolites in 12-hr urine samples after oral administration of sparteine sulfate. In vivo P450 db1-mediated drug metabolism was of the extensive metabolizer phenotype and did not differ significantly between liver-kidney microsomal-1 positive (metabolic ratio = 1.15 +/- 0.32) and liver-kidney microsomal-1 negative (metabolic ratio = 1.18 +/- 0.48) patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immune light and electron microscopic studies using monoclonal antibodies have been applied to localize HBeAg in liver biopsy specimens of 19 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Under the light microscope, HBeAg was demonstrated in nuclei, cytoplasm and on the cell surface of hepatocytes. The number of HBeAg-positive hepatocytes correlated well with the serum levels of HBeAg (enzyme immunoassay) and DNA-polymerase. Of 11 patients in whom high numbers of HBeAg-positive hepatocytes were found at the light microscopic level, HBeAg was also studied in hepatocytes at the electron microscopic level. The HBeAg in nuclei was either found as aggregates or dispersed diffusely. In the aggregates of HBeAg, the 27-nm core particles were frequently found. In addition, the antigen was found in the cytosol of some hepatocytes as amorphous mass and in some hepatocytes in the cisternae of perinuclear space, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi saccules. Occasionally the antigen was found on the membranes of the cell organelles and on the plasma membranes that faced the intercellular and the Disse spaces. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic HBeAg in hepatocytes may be ultrastructurally classified into two different patterns by its distribution, mainly in endoplasmic reticulum or in cytosol. The ratio varied between hepatocytes with these two types of patterns. The titer of serum HBeAg tended to be higher when the corresponding liver biopsy specimens contained more hepatocytes with HBeAg in endoplasmic reticulum than those with HBeAg in the cytosol.\r"

  ".W": "A likely mechanism of the strong hepatotrophism of the hepatitis B virus is the presence of specific receptors for the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus on hepatocyte membranes. To examine this hypothesis, we have performed binding studies using recombinant large (preS1 + preS2 + S) and major (S) proteins with adult human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, human fibroblasts, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma membranes derived from these cell types. We found that major HBsAg was able to bind specifically to human hepatocytes, human fibroblasts and human blood mononuclear cells. This binding could be inhibited by recombinant middle (preS2 + S) protein but not by the recombinant large protein. No binding could be demonstrated between large HBsAg and human hepatocytes. However, large protein bound specifically to plasma membranes derived from human liver tissue, human fibroblasts and HepG2A16 cells. This binding could be partially inhibited by the major protein and by a synthetic preS1 peptide but not by a synthetic preS2 peptide. These results support the assumption that hepatitis B virus absorption and penetration into human hepatocytes is mediated by specific receptors recognizing an amino acid sequence in the S-region. This recognition site is not displayed by the recombinant large protein. However, the large protein is recognized by its preS1 region and by a second binding site in the S-region by a receptor molecule, located on the inner surface of the plasma membranes or intracellular membranes of human hepatocytes and of some other cell types derived from human tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The value of measurement of hepatic iron concentration and determination of the hepatic iron index in distinguishing homozygotes from heterozygotes for hemochromatosis was examined. The study group included 42 homozygotes with an unequivocal diagnosis of hemochromatosis and six individuals who had initial equivocal results but were established as homozygous after extensive follow-up. These were compared with 15 heterozygotes with no sign of increasing body iron stores who had undergone liver biopsy because of an initial suspicion of raised iron levels. In these subjects a hepatic iron concentration of greater than 75 mumol/gm dry weight was clearly indicative of homozygous hemochromatosis. Body iron accumulation was age-related both in homozygotes and in these heterozygotes with mild biochemical abnormalities (r = 0.476; p = 0.001 and r = 0.689; p = 0.01, respectively), with a rate of accretion of approximately 5 mumol/gm dry weight/year in homozygotes and 0.9 mumol/gm dry weight/year in heterozygotes. Thus, lower values in young subjects may be consistent with homozygosity, and higher values in older individuals are consistent with heterozygosity. To overcome this problem, the hepatic iron index (hepatic iron concentration divided by age in years) was analyzed and found to separate the two groups effectively, with no homozygote having an index of less than 1.9 and no heterozygote having an index of greater than 1.5. These results in a series of patients who have been followed for a median of 3 yr (range = 1 to 30 yr) validate the use of the hepatic iron index to discriminate hemochromatosis homozygotes from heterozygotes with raised levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation or both.\r"

Hepatocytes were isolated from rats with chronic dietary iron overload and the effects of in vitro iron chelation on lipid peroxidation, cell viability and ultrastructure were studied over a 4-hr incubation period. Cell viability was significantly reduced at 3 and 4 hr in iron-loaded hepatocytes compared with controls and was preceded by an increase in iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Similarly, extensive degenerative ultrastructural changes were observed in iron-loaded hepatocytes compared with controls after 4 hr of incubation. In vitro iron chelation with either deferoxamine or apotransferrin protected against lipid peroxidation, loss of viability and ultrastructural damage in iron-loaded hepatocytes. The addition of an antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol, also protected against lipid peroxidation and preserved cell viability over a 4-hr incubation. The protective effects of iron chelators and alpha-tocopherol support a strong association between iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and hepatocellular injury in iron overload.\r"

Z lineage mice with five gene copies per haploid mouse genome (Z#1) demonstrated fine granular alpha 1-antitrypsin material and a few large globules. In contrast, Z lineage mice with 12 gene copies per haploid mouse genome (Z#2) demonstrated hepatocytes filled with homogeneous, eosinophilic globules that were strongly reactive with diastase and periodic acid-Schiff and antibody to alpha 1-antitrypsin. Scattered microscopic polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulations were seen that contained extracellular alpha 1-antitrypsin material, but there was neither histological nor serological evidence of mouse infectious hepatitis. In young animals, small clusters of hepatocytes lacking alpha 1-antitrypsin material were seen. These cells were the dominant population in older animals and formed nodular arrangements. Fibrosis was not demonstrable in neonatal and young animals or in any of the controls, but perisinusoidal fibrosis was seen in older Z#2 mice. Groups of hepatocytes without alpha 1-antitrypsin material showed dysplastic changes. We conclude that the transgenic mouse is a reliable and useful model in which to study the effects of alpha 1-antitrypsin in the liver because it demonstrates changes similar to those in the human disease.\r"

Propranolol and verapamil caused a significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (used as cytotoxic index in this study) in the culture media in a concentration-dependent manner, with LC50 values of 220 +/- 10 and 224 +/- 7 mumol/L, respectively. Atenolol, sotalol and procainamide had no effect on lactate dehydrogenase release. Electron microscopy of the hepatocytes showed that subtoxic concentrations of propranolol (12.5 to 125 mumol/L) and verapamil (12.5 to 100 mumol/L) induced multilamellar inclusion bodies after 24 hr of incubation. The two higher concentrations of propranolol (50 and 125 mumol/L) and 100 mumol/L of verapamil produced a significant decrease in the percentage of volume density of the mitochondria as quantitated by morphometrical analysis. An unusual feature of the electron microscopical changes with propranolol and verapamil was the presence of mitochondria within the multilamellar inclusion bodies. When these two drugs were used together or with subtoxic concentrations of amiodarone or desethylamiodarone, release of lactate dehydrogenase was significantly enhanced. No correlation was evident between the cytotoxic response and the volume density of cellular inclusions in hepatocytes treated with different concentrations of propranolol, verapamil, amiodarone or desethylamiodarone. Sotalol, atenolol and procainamide in concentrations up to 400 mumol/L did not produce any ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes after 24 hr of incubation. These results show that (a) cationic amphiphilic structure per se is not the only requirement for induction of multilamellar inclusions, (b) propranolol and verapamil can induce the formation of multilamellar inclusion bodies and cause a concentration-dependent release of lactate dehydrogenase from hepatocytes and (c) combination of different cationic amphiphiles in subtoxic concentrations can enhance cytotoxicity and increase the volume density of multilamellar inclusions.\r"

The distribution of these adhesion molecules was compared with the presence on inflammatory cells of their natural ligands, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and cluster of differentiation antigen-2, respectively. In normal liver, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 reacted weakly with sinusoidal lining cells, portal vessel endothelium and scattered mononuclear inflammatory cells, whereas hepatocytes were constantly negative. In contrast, all 114 biopsy samples of acute or chronic liver diseases revealed strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 on sinusoidal lining cells and on hepatocytes in areas of inflammation. Hepatocellular membrane positivity resulted in a \"honeycomb pattern\" of staining , which was panacinar in acute hepatitis and focal in chronic persistent or aggressive hepatitis. In various other chronic liver diseases, a multifocal periportal and intraacinar honeycomb pattern was detected. In all cases, a close topographical correlation was found between hepatocellular expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 on one hand and the presence of inflammatory cells expressing lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and cluster of differentiation antigen-2 on the other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In patients with cirrhosis, vasopressin infusion induces sustained vasoconstriction and elevation of arterial pressure. The vasopressor effect could be caused by impairment of mechanisms normally aimed at buffering increases in arterial pressure (reflex bradycardia and decreases in arteriolar resistance). We studied the acute effects of continuous vasopressin infusion (0.4 IU/min) on systemic hemodynamics in seven patients with cirrhosis and in six patients without cirrhosis (controls). Vasopressin effects on systemic O2 consumption were also studied. In both groups, vasopressin infusion induced similar peak increases in arterial pressure, followed by similar decreases in heart rate and cardiac output. However, cirrhotic patients and controls differed 30 min after the start of vasopressin infusion. At 30 min, mean arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance remained significantly higher than preinfusion values in patients with cirrhosis. No decrease in systemic O2 consumption occurred in cirrhotic patients. In controls, at 30 min, mean arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure had returned to baseline. Systemic vascular resistance was not significantly higher than the preinfusion value and systemic O2 consumption had significantly decreased to below preinfusion values. We conclude that the vasopressor effect of vasopressin is abnormally sustained in patients with cirrhosis. This might be caused by insufficient buffering of vasopressin-induced arteriolar constriction rather than by abnormal vagal control of heart rate. In turn, as suggested by the lack of a decrease in systemic O2 consumption, persistent arteriolar constriction might be related to abnormally sustained sympathetic vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

These subsets were compared with peripheral-blood large granular lymphocytes and were found to differ phenotypically and functionally. Phenotypical differences included lower expression of the asialo-GM1 marker of natural killer cells, lower cellular density and many more small cytoplasmic granules in hepatic large, granular lymphocytes. Low-density hepatic large, granular lymphocytes were five to eight times more cytotoxic than blood large, granular lymphocytes on a per-cell basis as measured against YAC-1 cells and colon carcinoma cells. In addition, hepatic large, granular lymphocytes were able to lyse P-815 target cells, which are resistant to blood natural killer cells. Large, granular lymphocytes isolated from the liver also contained a subset with intermediate phenotypical and functional characteristics, possibly representing a transitional form between blood and \"liver-specific\" large, granular lymphocytes. The liver thus contains a specific population of highly activated or further differentiated large granular lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Although the liver is known to extract amino acids and organic anions by well-characterized transport systems, the factors that regulate the hepatic uptake of small, circulating peptides are poorly understood. We previously reported that cholecystokinin octapeptide, a biologically active form of cholecystokinin, is efficiently cleared by the liver and that uptake depends on its carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2). Here we further define the physicochemical determinants for hepatic clearance of cholecystokinin. A series of 13 tetrapeptides, including eight analogs of the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of cholecystokinin-8 with different charges, hydrophobicity and amino-acid sequences, were prepared by solid-phase synthesis, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by amino-acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Radioiodination was performed by oxidative or nonoxidative techniques. Hydrophobicity of individual radiolabeled peptides was calculated using published hydrophobicity data or measured directly by determining their partition between octanol and aqueous triethylammonium acetate. First-pass hepatic extraction of radiolabeled peptides was determined with a nonrecirculating, isolated, perfused rat liver model. First-pass hepatic extraction of injected, labeled peptides varied from 4% to 86% and correlated significantly (r = 0.85; p less than 0.0002) with hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic peptides with positive, neutral or negative charges were avidly extracted (30% to 86%) by the liver; first-pass clearance of hydrophobic peptides with similar charges varied with amino-acid sequence. In contrast, the first-pass hepatic extraction of positively or negatively charged hydrophilic tetrapeptides was negligible (less than 10%). These results suggest that hydrophobicity and amino-acid sequence--but not anionic or cationic nature--are the major determinants of hepatic extraction of cholecystokinin, and perhaps other small, circulating peptides.\r"

The animals were divided into three experimental groups that received equal volumes (1 ml, intravenously) of physiological saline (controls), cyclosporin A vehicle (a fat emulsion, Intralipid, mixed with absolute ethanol) or cyclosporin A dissolved in the aforementioned mixture. In another series of assays, horseradish peroxidase was coinjected with cyclosporin A vehicle or with the solution containing cyclosporin A. Only after cyclosporin A administration was an immediate inhibition in bile flow and in the biliary concentrations and secretion of bile acids and bilirubin found. In addition, a delay in the peak time of the appearance of horseradish peroxidase together with a reduction in the biliary excretion rate and in the total amount of horseradish peroxidase excreted were observed during cholestasis. At 40 to 50 min after drug administration, all biliary parameters evaluated had returned to the pretest values. The relationship between bile flow and bile acid secretion showed that cyclosporin A-induced cholestasis is related to a decrease of both the bile acid-dependent and bile acid-independent fractions of bile flow. At the end of the cyclosporin A assays, the serum bile acid, total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin concentrations were greater than those observed in the controls and Intralipid-treated animals. These effects were dose-dependent. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies did not reveal architectural hepatic abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This issue's cover story takes a look at some of the key strategies that outpatient executives are implementing in their markets. Examples range from a large university teaching hospital, to a suburban facility, to a 40-bed rural hospital in Minnesota. Business strategy is only part of the outpatient story, however. One of the key questions that health care executives must answer is where the outpatient management talent will come from. Outpatient executives report that many of the same skills are needed in this setting as are necessary in the traditional inpatient side; however, there are major differences in management expertise that could make or break a hospital's outpatient services. Moreover, some experts say that this emerging definition of what it takes to be a successful outpatient services executive may be shaping the mold for all future health care executives, both inpatient and outpatient.\r"

A gradual increase was noted in dietary intake of calories, carbohydrate and sodium during the study period, attaining statistical significance after 10-12 months of therapy. A trend toward increased dietary intake of protein, lipid and potassium was observed, but the differences did not achieve statistical significance. Although a trend toward decreased dialysis clearance at higher hematocrits was found for creatinine clearances did not change significantly for any of the solutes examined, and linear regression analysis did not demonstrate a strong relationship between dialyzer clearance and hematocrit values within the range observed in this study.\r"

Baseline serum total LDH activity in the ESRD group was midly but significantly higher than that found in the normal control group. The observed elevation was associated with an isomorphic pattern. Single passage of blood through the extracorporeal apparatus led to a rise in total LDH, LDH-3, LDH-2 and LDH-4, a pattern consistent with release from the platelets. A steady increase was noted in total LDH, LDH-5 and LDH-1 of arterial blood during hemodialysis. This was thought to be due to ultrafiltration-induced hemoconcentration, enzyme release from the formed elements within the extracorporeal circuit and complement-mediated leukocyte activation and pulmonary leukostasis. These observations should be taken into consideration with regards to interpretation of LDH and LDH isoenzyme values and proper time of blood sampling in ESRD patients.\r"

Dipstick proteinuria was present in 78 patients (20.6%). Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) was present in 17 patients (4.6%) and showed a high degree of association with proteinuria and increased age. In patients with CRI, the severity of renal dysfunction was also age-related. In the 284 patients without proteinuria or CRI, mean serum creatinine levels were lower than predicted. We conclude that in patients with SCA, serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of normal should be regarded with suspicion, and that the prevalence and severity of proteinuria and CRI in SCA is high and increases with age.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of achieving effective mechanical ventricular assistance without the need for thoracotomy provides great clinical advantages. Two in vitro systems were used to assess left ventricular unloading by means of a small-diameter cannula inserted retrograde into the left ventricle by cannulation of the femoral artery. This cannula is connected to the inlet of a centrifugal blood pump (CP) that delivers the blood into the contralateral femoral artery. Steady-flow test circulation was used to pump fluid in a closed loop from a reservoir through the test cannula back into the reservoir. Pressure drops over cannulae with inner diameters of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 mm at flows of 2, 2.5, 3 L/min, against a pressure of 60, 80, 100, and 120 mmHg were calculated. A stationary pressure drop of 120 mmHg was measured at a flow of 3 L/min through a 100 cm cannula with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The second system was a pulsatile mock circulation composed of an atrial and an arterial reservoir linked by a pneumatic prosthetic ventricle. This system was coupled with a 100 cm cannula, 6.1 mm inner diameter, which was passed across the outflow valve of the pulsatile prosthetic ventricle and connected to a CP. Fluid was withdrawn from the ventricle and pumped back into the arterial reservoir. Pulsatile pressure drop over the cannula was measured at different CP flows for increasing systolic ventricular pressure; heart unloading was quantified as a function of CP flow under baseline and failing conditions of the prosthetic left ventricle model. At a constant CP flow the pressure drop over the cannula increased with the pulsatility inside the ventricle. The work of the prosthetic ventricle was reduced by more than 50% when the CP pump was set to 3 L/min; at the same flow setting, when the situation of a failing left ventricle was simulated, the CP was able to take over all the work of the prosthetic ventricle, establishing a stationary flow and a 25% higher mean aortic pressure. This approach to left ventricular assistance may have significant clinical relevance.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous bone marrow (BM) transplantation is being increasingly applied in hematological and oncological patients. However, because of the need to purify and preserve BM requiring high technology, such treatments are virtually concentrated in the \"developed\" countries. This paper examines methods of BM purification and freezing that could make the technique potentially applicable in developing countries. Hemapheresis is routinely applied for BM purification in our Dutch Centre, where the buffy coats obtained from routine blood donations were utilised in experimental settings. Using DMSO as cryoprotectant, semi-purified white cells were frozen in liquid N2 (LN2), by mechanical freezer or snap-frozen at -55 degrees C. Different types of containers were compared including plastic tubes and ordinary blood bags. After thawing the results show that snap-freezing had a deleterious effect but the cell yields and viability were similar in LN2 or the mechanical freezer where the tubes and the bag were equally effective as containers (86% cell recovery with 90% viability). In the purification/concentration stage, reduction of the volume of the material by extra centrifugation, thus requiring less DMSO, produced better results--96% cell yield and 90% viability after thawing. This simplified method was applied in a general hospital in Sao Paulo where four oncology patients underwent BM collection. BM was purified and concentrated within a blood bank facility. Hydroxyethyl starch sedimentation and centrifugation of the material in plastic blood bags gave 80% BM cell harvest. After thawing from the mechanical freezer 1 x 10(8) BM cells/kg were available for reinfusion to patients. There was no immediate untoward reaction. Three of the patients showed signs of bone marrow regeneration by three weeks, but one patient died 16 days after transplantation, of septicemia. We conclude that certain high-technology procedures for ABMT can be adapted for existing facilities in developing countries.\r"

Fifty-four consecutive patients were screened weekly for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Sixty-three percent showed intrusive recollections of the initial trauma (partial diagnostic criteria) and 16 (29.6%) of the sample met full criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder at some point during the hospitalization. None of the patients met the full diagnostic criteria at discharge from the hospital, although one did at follow-up. Post-traumatic stress disorder was found to be related to patients' total body surface area burn, length of hospital stay, sex (female patients), and lack of responsibility for the injury. The results suggest that although post-traumatic stress disorder in patients with burn injuries generally resolves without interventions other than standard hospital care, it might be preventable if patients who are at risk for developing it receive appropriate psychologic treatment soon after the injury.\r"

Additionally, free CAD grafts were evaluated for their suitability as dermal substitutes. Male Buffalo rats were used as donors and male Lewis rats as recipients. Split-thickness skin obtained from Buffalo rats was separated into epidermis and dermis by means of Dispase II enzyme. The epidermal layers were minced and trypsinized. Then dispersed single keratinocytes were inoculated onto a irradiated 3T3 cell feeder layer. After a suitable period, a confluent cultured keratinocyte layer was detached and provided CAES grafts. Cultured allogeneic dermis grafts were prepared from cultures of the dermal component. Cultured allogeneic dermis grafts, covered by split thickness isografts (STIG) or local skin flaps, became revascularized at a rate of 94.6% and 90.9%, respectively, 7 days after grafting. However, only 25% of CAD grafts covered by synthetic materials became vascularized. Four types of wound coverage were compared including: (1) CAES grafts, (2) CAES over CAD grafts, (3) split-thickness isografts, and (4) STIG over CAD grafts. In groups 2 and 4, CAD grafts were applied 7 days before CAES grafts or STIG. Grafts of groups 1 and 2 were successful in only 36.7% and 31.1% of the animals and resulted in a high rate of wound contracture--72.4%, 66.7%, respectively. On the other hand, in groups 3 and 4, higher average rates of revascularization (92.0% and 88.3%) and lower rates of wound contracture (25.4% and 24.2%) were obtained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten data screens are used for entry of the administrative data, the clinical background, and the monitored data. The latter include tables for recording fluid therapy and laboratory results. The knowledge base consists of a series of heuristic decision rules that were formulated by a burn care expert and that express the Uppsala fluid resuscitation program to prevent burn shock. The data recorded for a patient are compared with the data in the knowledge base, and the appropriate conclusions are generated. The system's conclusions, the fluid and ventilation prescription, and other required patient management measures are then displayed as a report. The underlying reasoning for each case may be explored by means of the system's explanation facility. The system has been successfully validated by 125 hypothetic cases that represent typical situations of patients with severe burns.\r"

Important treatment principles that were instrumental to recovery include a high-calorie, high-protein diet, iron supplementation, use of pediatric blood sampling techniques, and monitoring for and prophylaxis against infection while allowing eschar to separate spontaneously rather than performing early debridement. Amputation of mummified electrically burned limbs at more proximal levels, including marginally viable muscle, is recommended to minimize infection and decrease blood loss associated with customary conservative serial debridements.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured keratinocytes are used for wound coverage in some patients with extensive burns, but there are difficulties in assessing when the keratinocytes are ready for grafting. The morphologic characteristics of developing cultured skin provide a method of identifying mature grafts. This study investigated the structure of cultured keratinocytes (apical and basal cells) by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy. Both primary cultures and secondary-passage cultured keratinocytes were studied from subconfluence through maturity and into senescence. At subconfluence, the keratinocytes comprised one cell layer, contiguous in some areas, and appeared as irregular, polygonal cells with protruding nuclei. Contiguous cell membranes had microvillae that varied in pattern and length. With initial stratification (two layers), the apical cells were immature and had finger-like microvillae that projected from rounded cells. The basal cells were uniformly covered with short microvillae. Additional stratification (four to five cell layers) gave rise to an apical layer that resembled a quasi-stratum corneum in which cells lacked both cytoplasm and nuclei. Basal cells were plump and regular, with microvillae that protruded from intact cell membranes. These characteristics can be used as indicators of mature keratinocytes to optimize the take of keratinocyte grafts. At senescence, many basal cells were flattened and lacked part of their cell membrane. There are defects in the cultured keratinocyte cell sheet that would limit graft take. A comparison between primary culture and secondary passage noted that primary-culture cultured keratinocytes were less suitable for grafting purposes because of the variation in maturation rates between dishes that were plated at the same time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such a method is necessary to provide a descriptive terminology for the comparison of burn scars and the results of treatment. The method should be applicable to patients both within an institution and between burn centers. A burn scar assessment has been devised based on physical parameters. These relate to the healing and maturation of wounds, cosmetic appearance, and the function of the healed skin. Pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and scar height are assessed independently, with increasing score being assigned to the greater pathologic condition. Normal skin has a score of 0. Seventy-three patients were assessed by three separate occupational therapists and the findings subjected to statistical analysis for interrater reliability. For each parameter a Cohen's kappa statistic of approximately 0.5 +/- 0.1 indicates a statistically significant agreement between observers. These values were found to improve with time. This appears to be a useful tool for the assessment of burn scars, allowing objective comparison of the same scar by different observers.\r"

Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 598 (33%) of the 1,835 patients with a prior history of infarction or angina and 934 (57%) of the 1,630 without such a history (p less than 0.001). Patients with new onset ischemic heart disease with acute myocardial infarction were more likely than patients with infarction and exacerbated chronic ischemic heart disease to have Q wave infarction (57% versus 36%) and to receive thrombolytic therapy (11% versus 5%); they also had higher maximal creatine kinase levels (1,088 +/- 1,299 versus 733 +/- 906 U/liter) (p less than 0.0001 for all three). After adjustment for differences in clinical presentation and initial triage, patients with new onset ischemic heart disease with acute myocardial infarction were less likely than the comparison group to have congestive complications (odds ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.84, p less than 0.01) but not less likely to have arrhythmic, ischemic or overall complications. Among patients with angina without acute myocardial infarction, patients with new onset ischemic heart disease were less likely to have recurrent ischemic pain and congestive heart failure. In multivariate analysis of long-term follow-up data on 457 patients from one hospital, patients with new onset ischemic heart disease had better cardiovascular survival rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To extend such assessment to patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, this study evaluated the prognostic utility of several risk factors in the 3,339 patients (2,742 men, 597 women, aged 24 to 78 years) enrolled in Phase II of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial. Before intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was given, the presence of each of eight risk factors was noted: age greater than or equal to 70 years, female gender, a history of diabetes mellitus or previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic evidence of evolving anterior infarction or atrial fibrillation, evidence on physical examination of mild pulmonary congestion or hypotension (systolic pressure less than 100 mm Hg) and sinus tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100 beats/min). Of the 3,339 patients, the 78 with pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock were excluded because their risk was known to be high. Of the remaining 3,261, 864 (26%) had no risk factor (low risk); their mortality rate at 6 weeks was only 1.5%. In contrast, 2,397 (74%) had one or more risk factors (not low risk); of these, 5.3% died in 6 weeks (p less than 0.001). Among those with one or more risk factors, mortality at 6 weeks was related to the number of risk factors on admission; those with four or more had a mortality rate at 6 weeks of 17.2%. Thus, these eight risk factors can be easily remembered and assessed in patients with myocardial infarction who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy and can be used to estimate short-term mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of semiemergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables was assessed in 76 patients with unstable angina secondary to an isolated severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. All patients manifested symmetric T wave inversion in two or more anterior ECG leads. Wall motion abnormalities were present in 37 patients on ventriculography before dilation. Angioplasty was successful in 70 patients (92%), resulting in a reduction in luminal diameter stenosis from 91 +/- 8% to 21 +/- 6%, with no major acute procedure-related complications observed. The other six patients underwent semiurgent (less than 48 h) coronary artery bypass surgery and three patients experienced a myocardial infarction (before bypass surgery in two). Serial ECGs revealed complete resolution of ST-T wave changes in 51% of patients at 14 weeks and in 90% at 28 weeks. In contrast, prolongation of the corrected QT interval, which was present in 16 patients (8%), normalized within 48 h of successful angioplasty. Twelve of these 16 patients with a prolonged QT interval had nonocclusive thrombus formation and poor collateral circulation on angiography. Patients were followed up for 6 to 43 months (mean 23 +/- 10). Angiographic evidence of restenosis was present in 34% of patients, all of whom underwent a successful second or third procedure. One death occurred at 8 months after successful angioplasty. Wall motion abnormalities had completely resolved in 13 of 15 patients who underwent repeat ventriculography, at which time 10 had a normal ECG. This study demonstrates that ECG changes may persist for up to 7 months in patients who undergo successful angioplasty for severe left anterior descending coronary artery disease and unstable angina. Semiemergent angioplasty was associated with a high initial success rate and excellent long-term outcome.\r"

Quantitative angiography showed a reduction in stenosis diameter from 83 +/- 14% to 42 +/- 14% after conventional balloon dilation, with a further reduction to -3 +/- 12% after stent placement (p less than 0.001). There were no acute stent thromboses, but one patient (with two stents and unstented distal disease) developed subacute thrombosis on day 8 after self-discontinuation of warfarin and was treated with thrombolytic therapy and redilation. Follow-up angiography was performed at 4 to 6 months in 25 patients, demonstrating restenosis (83 +/- 13%) in 4 (57%) of 7 patients with multiple stents, but only 3 (17%) of 18 patients with a single stent (p less than 0.05). Six of the seven in-stent restenotic lesions were subtotal (80 +/- 12%) and were subjected to repeat conventional balloon angioplasty (postdilation stenosis 13 +/- 21%). The 18 patients without restenosis had a maximal in-stent diameter stenosis of 29 +/- 15%, corresponding to a maximal focal neointimal thickness of 0.68 +/- 0.26 mm within the stented segment. These preliminary results suggest that the Schatz-Palmaz stent may be a useful adjunctive device in the performance of coronary angioplasty.\r"

Myocardial wall thickness was assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography at 8 left ventricular and 10 right ventricular sites in 67 patients (mean age 40 years) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the findings were analyzed in relation to the presence of abnormal Q waves on the 12 lead rest electrocardiogram (ECG). Nineteen (28%) of the 67 patients had abnormal Q waves. Right ventricular hypertrophy was significantly more common in patients without abnormal Q waves (25 [52%] of 48 versus 2 [11%] of 19, p less than 0.001). With univariate analysis, there were six measurements that were significantly associated with abnormal Q waves: an increase in upper anterior septal thickness (p less than 0.005) and maximal left ventricular wall thickness (p less than 0.02), a decrease in mean and maximal right ventricular wall thickness (both p less than 0.005) and an increase in the ratio of both upper anterior septal to mean right ventricular wall thickness (p less than 0.005) and upper anterior septal to upper posterior wall thickness (p less than 0.005). With multivariate analysis, only the ratios of upper anterior septal to mean right ventricular wall thickness (p less than 0.005) and to upper posterior wall thickness (p less than 0.05) were significantly related to the presence of abnormal Q waves and predicted Q wave location with a sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of 90%, 88% and 89%, respectively. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the presence of abnormal Q waves on the 12 lead ECG is primarily a function of the relation of right ventricular wall thickness and upper anterior septal thickness.\r"

Of 119 patients who received the implantable defibrillator in this institution, 40 had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30% (Group A) and 79 had an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 30% (Group B). For each group, cumulative survival was compared with the projected survival if the implantable defibrillator had not been used. Projected survival was based on the assumption that the first appropriate shock would have resulted in death without the defibrillator. For Group A, the 3 year cumulative survival rate was 67 +/- 12% versus a projected survival rate of 6 +/- 15% (p less than 0.001). For Group B, the 3 year cumulative survival rate was 96 +/- 3% versus a projected survival rate of 46 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001). Both the cumulative and projected survival rates for patients in Group A were significantly worse than for patients in Group B (p less than 0.01). The projected survival rates for both Groups A and B were comparable with the observed survival rate in similar patients treated without the implantable defibrillator. In summary, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator significantly prolonged overall survival, even in patients with poor cardiac function. The technique of estimating projected survival appears to allow a realistic estimate of the reduction in mortality achieved by the defibrillator.\r"

Radionuclide ventriculography was performed an average of 7.6 days after acute myocardial infarction. All geometric models significantly separated 20 normal subjects from 137 patients with recent infarction (p less than 0.001). Cumulative mortality data demonstrated that significant independent univariate dichotomizing potency and augmentation of the mortality risk-discriminating power of the global ejection fraction were provided by models of regional emptying that 1) conformed to coronary artery perfusion areas, 2) encompassed total ventricular counts, 3) expressed variability in regional relative to global ejection fraction, and 4) simulated a pattern of emptying directed toward the center of geometry of the left ventricle. The combination of a four quadrant geometric model with axes drawn 45 degrees above the horizontal and a coefficient of variation calculated as square root of sigma(GEF - REF)2/4 x 100/GEF (where GEF = global ejection fraction and REF = regional ejection fraction) proved to be optimal. This coefficient averaged 12.2% in normal subjects and 32.2% in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The severity of aortic regurgitation was assessed by color flow mapping; 17 patients had grade 2, 10 had grade 3 and 5 had grade 4 aortic regurgitation. Regression equations for pressure half-time area versus planimetry mitral valve area were calculated separately for the aortic regurgitation (r = 0.88) and the nonaortic regurgitation group (r = 0.86); analysis of covariance revealed a significant (p less than 0.001) difference between the two groups leading to overestimation of planimetry area by the pressure half-time method in the aortic regurgitation group. The mitral valve areas in the group without regurgitation were best calculated with the expression 239/T1/2 (r = 0.77) as compared with a best fit of 195/T1/2 (r = 0.85) for the aortic regurgitation group. To elucidate the mechanisms affecting pressure half-time in aortic regurgitation, an in vitro model of mitral inflow in the presence of varying regurgitant volumes and different ventricular chamber compliances was used. Aortic regurgitation shortened directly measured pressure half-time proportional to the regurgitant fraction but an increase in left ventricular compliance could offset this effect. Finally, in a mathematic model of mitral inflow the competing effects of aortic regurgitation and chamber compliance could be confirmed. In conclusion, aortic regurgitation results clinically in a significant net shortening of pressure half-time leading to mitral valve area overestimation. However, the effect is moderate and individually unpredictable because of changes in chamber compliance.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that proximal aortic regurgitant jet width on Doppler color flow mapping predicts severity of aortic regurgitation. The influence of aortic valve morphology on proximal regurgitant jet width has not been studied. Despite equal cross-sectional area, differences in aortic valve morphology may influence regurgitant jet width and thus estimates of severity of aortic regurgitation. Aortic valve simulations representing degenerative, rheumatic and bicuspid valves as well as a circle in two cross-sectional areas (0.2 cm2 and 0.7 cm2) were placed in a flow model using two gradients (50 and 100 mm Hg) to produce simulated aortic regurgitant jets. Flow maps were obtained from parasternal and apical positions with color gain, frames per second, low velocity reject and depth held constant. The mean of three regurgitant jet widths for each shape, size and gradient were compared by three factor analysis of variance. Aortic valve morphology significantly affected regurgitant jet width in both parasternal and apical views (p = 0.0001 by analysis of variance) with bicuspid shapes producing regurgitant jet widths significantly different from all other shapes. Valve area also consistently significantly influenced proximal regurgitant jet width (p = 0.0001) in both views. Initial pressure gradient was less important. It is concluded that in an in vitro flow model aortic valve morphology introduces significant variability in the measurement of proximal regurgitant jet widths independent of orifice cross-sectional area. Estimates of severity of aortic regurgitation may therefore be influenced considerably by aortic valve morphology.\r"

Old myocardial infarction was present in 43 patients and dilated cardiomyopathy in 12. In group I (n = 36), nadolol was given alone, whereas in group II (n = 24), previously ineffective treatment with amiodarone was continued in combination with nadolol. Left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in patients in group I (0.40 +/- 0.12) than in group II (0.30 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01) patients. Electrophysiologic study was repeated after short-term treatment with nadolol, which was continued regardless of the results of this test, according to the scheme of the parallel approach. Recurrence of spontaneous tachycardia or sudden death occurred in 21 patients after 10 +/- 9.2 months; sustained tachycardia was inducible in 19 on nadolol therapy. The remaining 39 patients (of whom 21 had inducible tachycardia while taking the drug) have had no recurrence of tachycardia after 27.8 +/- 9.3 months of follow-up study. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of a positive and negative test were 90.5%, 46%, 47.5% and 90%, respectively. The results differ between group I and group II patients, the latter having a high percent of false positive responses. This difference is even more obvious with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction: the predictive value of a positive test was 86% when ejection fraction was greater than 0.40 and 39% when it was less than 0.40.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The anterograde Wenckebach cycle length increased from 300 +/- 41 to 320 +/- 42 ms (p less than 0.05). Retrograde conduction was abolished in five patients. Atrioventricular node tachycardia was still inducible in three patients. During a follow-up period of 9 +/- 3 months, four patients remained clinically asymptomatic without drug therapy and four patients had recurrent symptoms. Three of the latter responded to previously unsuccessful antiarrhythmic drugs and the fourth patient underwent surgical cure for persistence of tachycardia. Right bundle branch block occurred in five patients; it was permanent in four and transient in one.

High quality cross-sectional images delineating the unique morphologic details of both atrial appendages were obtained in every patient. Abnormal cardiac position such as dextrocardia (four patients) or mesocardia (two patients) did not pose any problems for transesophageal assessment of both atrial appendages. Thus, direct diagnosis of atrial situs was possible in every patient. Atrial situs solitus was present in 127 patients studied. Three patients were found to have situs inversus, one had left atrial isomerism and one had right atrial isomerism. No patient with juxtaposed atrial appendages was encountered. All patients had prior subcostal ultrasound scans for assessment of the morphology and relation of the suprarenal abdominal great vessels and the related patterns of hepatic venous drainage. Patients with abnormal atrial situs had correlative high kilovoltage filter beam radiography for assessment of bronchus morphology. The results of situs determination obtained by either method were in agreement. In this series, transesophageal echocardiography allowed the direct and accurate visualization of both atrial appendages and the determination of atrial situs in all patients studied. Transesophageal echocardiography may prove to be the most reliable in vivo technique for determination of atrial situs.\r"

  ".U": "90324497\r", 
  ".W": "From 1986 to 1988, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 32 patients with congenital valvular aortic stenosis. The patients ranged in age from 2 days to 28 years (mean +/- SD 8.3 +/- 5.9). One balloon was used in 17 patients and two balloons were used in 15 patients. Immediately after valvuloplasty, peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve decreased significantly from 77 +/- 27 to 23 +/- 16 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), a 70% reduction in gradient. At early follow-up study (4.1 +/- 3.3 months after valvuloplasty), there was a 48 +/- 20.5% reduction in gradient compared with that before valvuloplasty, and at late follow-up evaluation (19.2 +/- 5.6 months), a reduction in gradient of 40 +/- 29% persisted. Echocardiography showed evidence of significantly increased aortic regurgitation in 10 patients (31%) and aortic valve prolapse in 7 patients (22%). There was no correlation between the balloon/anulus ratio and the subsequent development of aortic regurgitation or prolapse. In fact, no patient who showed a significant increase in aortic regurgitation had had a balloon/anulus ratio greater than 100%. It is concluded that balloon aortic valvuloplasty effectively reduces peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve in patients with congenital aortic stenosis. However, subsequent aortic regurgitation and prolapse occur in a significant number of patients, even if appropriate technique and a balloon size no greater than that of the aortic anulus are used.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative incidence of the primary morphologic features; the correlation between the presence or absence of mitral valve to pulmonary valve fibrous continuity and the type of VA connection; the types and incidence of additional cardiovascular anomalies; and the correlation between the determination of the VA connection by echocardiography versus that ascertained at intraoperative and autopsy inspection. A spectrum of VA connections was found, ranging from double outlet right ventricle (23%) at one extreme, through an intermediate type (64%) in which the pulmonary artery was overriding the ventricular septum, thereby having no consistent and predominant connection to either ventricle, to a discordant VA connection (13%) at the opposite end of the spectrum. All three types of VA connection occurred whether or not there was mitral valve to pulmonary valve fibrous continuity. Additional cardiovascular anomalies were present in 95% of patients, the most common being aortic arch obstructive lesions in 59%, anomalous attachments of the atrioventricular valve tension apparatus in 55% and subaortic stenosis in 50%. A method of echocardiographic determination of the VA connection that correlated with that determined intraoperatively and from pathologic specimen analysis is described.\r"

Its fractional extraction is enhanced in ischemic or hypoxic myocardium but returns to baseline levels on reperfusion and recovery of normal function. Thus, this agent might be useful in delineating acutely hypoxic but potentially salvageable myocardium. Accordingly, to delineate the relation between the myocardial extraction of 18F-fluoromisonidazole after intravenous administration and the time of antecedent ischemia in vivo, uptake of tracer was measured with positron emission tomography and direct postmortem tissue analysis in 14 dogs in which tracer was administered within 3 h of coronary occlusion (a time associated with marked potential for salvage on reperfusion); in 4 dogs after 6 h of coronary occlusion (a time associated with minimal salvage of myocardium on reperfusion); and in 8 dogs after greater than 24 h of coronary occlusion (to delineate uptake in tissue that is irreversibly damaged). The residual fraction (that is, the amount of tracer extracted and retained in a region) in ischemic myocardium in the dogs in which 18F-fluoromisonidazole was administered within 3 h after occlusion averaged (+/- standard deviation) 23 +/- 18%, which was higher than the residual fraction in myocardium subjected to ischemia for either 6 or greater than 24 h before tracer administration (12 +/- 7% and 5 +/- 2%, respectively, p less than 0.01 for both). Retention of tracer in remote normal myocardium averaged 2 +/- 1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the beta-adrenergic effects of epinephrine may be detrimental because of the stimulation of myocardial oxygen demand. To test whether functional recovery from fibrillation in hearts treated with a selective alpha-adrenergic agent is greater than in hearts treated with epinephrine, ventricular fibrillation was induced in eight isolated dog hearts while coronary perfusion pressure was maintained at 30 mm Hg. In random order, epinephrine (5 micrograms/min), phenylephrine (50 micrograms/min) or no drug was infused for 5 min. The heart was then defibrillated, the drug infusion stopped and coronary perfusion pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Coronary blood flow (ml/min per 100 g), arteriovenous oxygen difference (ml O2/dl) and myocardial oxygen consumption (ml O2/min per 100 g) measured after 4 min of ventricular fibrillation were greater with epinephrine (mean +/- SD 30.9 +/- 11.7, 17.5 +/- 1.6 and 5.4 +/- 1.9, respectively) than with phenylephrine (24.4 +/- 6.0, 15.7 +/- 2.6 and 3.8 +/- 1.1, respectively) or no drug (19.8 +/- 5.2, 12.8 +/- 1.8 and 2.6 +/- 0.7, respectively) (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively).

  ".W": "The feasibility and effectiveness of low energy synchronous transcatheter cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation were examined in dogs with talc-induced pericarditis. A conventional electrode catheter was positioned transvenously in the right atrial appendage. Atrial flutter/fibrillation was induced by using the train pulse method, and the tachyarrhythmia-inducing threshold was determined. The minimal effective cardioversion energy levels were compared in three different cardioversion methods: method A = delivery of shock between the proximal electrode (cathode) and the backplate (anode), method B = delivery between the proximal electrode (cathode) and the distal electrode (anode) and method C = conventional external cardioversion. In both methods A and B, all 149 cardioversion attempts were successful with shocks of less than or equal to 5 J. Shocks of less than or equal to 1 J resulted in successful cardioversion in 57 (70%) of 81 attempts, 50 (74%) of 68 attempts and 5 (12%) of 41 attempts with methods A, B and C, respectively. The mean minimal effective cardioversion energy levels were not significantly different between methods A and B (0.62 +/- 0.67 versus 0.58 +/- 0.71 J). Transcatheter cardioversion decreased the defibrillation threshold 3- to 75-fold (mean 6- to 7-fold) from that of transthoracic cardioversion. The defibrillation threshold was not influenced by the inducibility of atrial flutter/fibrillation. There were no complications of heart block, ventricular fibrillation or pathologic evidence of severe shock-induced atrial injury. Thus, low energy synchronous transcatheter cardioversion of atrial flutter/fibrillation is considered feasible and effective. This technique may also be useful in managing the atrial flutter/fibrillation that can occur during electrophysiologic studies.\r"

Using similar over the wire catheter systems and laser delivery periods of 3 to 5 s, thermal laser angioplasty was achieved with a 1.3 mm metal probe heated with 10 W of continuous argon laser energy and excimer laser angioplasty was performed with a 4.5F excimer laser catheter consisting of 13 concentrically arranged 200 microns fiber optics delivering 35 to 40 mJ/mm2 of xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser irradiation at a repetition rate of 25 to 30 Hz and a pulse duration of 120 ns. On angiography, the incidence of vessel perforation (1 in 10 versus 3 in 10) and abrupt vessel closure (0 in 10 versus 2 in 10) was less with excimer compared with thermal laser angioplasty. Macroscopically, there was a greater incidence of mural and occlusive thrombus formation after thermal laser than after pulsed excimer laser angioplasty. Histologic examination confirmed that this thrombogenicity was associated with greater charring and coagulation necrosis of the media. Quantitative indium-111-labeled platelet deposition was significantly increased after thermal laser angioplasty (median 87.2 x 10(6)/cm length) compared with excimer-treated (0.4 x 10(6)/cm length) or control (1.2 x 10(6)cm length) segments (p less than 0.001). Thus, excimer laser angioplasty was found to result in fewer complications and, as a consequence, less thrombosis and platelet accumulation than did thermal laser angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Radial head subluxation (RHS) produces no radiographic abnormalities according to most experts. However, recent anecdotal case reports have identified displacement of the radiocapitellar line (RCL) in pediatric patients with RHS. To verify this finding, we retrospectively reviewed all patients less than 5 years of age who received elbow and forearm radiographs in our emergency department. From January 1988 through April 1989, we identified 20 cases of RHS. Of the 20 radiographs, 5 (25%) were read by the attending radiologist as abnormal due to RCL displacement indicating subluxation of the radiocapitellar articulation. All 5 of these radiographs had RCL displacement greater than 3 mm. The remaining normal radiographs had RCL displacement less than or equal to 3 mm. The presence of RCL displacement without disruption of the radiocapitellar articulation confirms the diagnosis of RHS, but does not appear to change treatment or outcome in this subset of patients. In addition, radiographs may not be mandatory when the diagnosis of RHS is certain. We suggest obtaining radiographs if the history (i.e., fall) or physical examination is atypical or if reduction is unsuccessful to rule out more serious injuries such as radial head dislocation or fracture.\r"

Patients with the clinical diagnosis of biliary tract disease were divided into two groups: those with confirmed biliary tract disease and those who did not have gall bladder disease. There were no major radiologic findings (pneumoperitoneum, pneumobilia, or bowel obstruction) in any patient with biliary tract disease. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of minor radiologic findings (right upper quadrant calcification, mild ileus and right basilar atelectasis) in patients with biliary colic and acute cholecystitis. Additionally, there was no significant difference in minor findings between patients with biliary tract and nonbiliary tract disease. Plain abdominal radiographic findings were found to be nonspecific in patients with gallbladder disease and not useful in differentiating between patients with biliary colic and acute cholecystitis. Our results also suggest that plain abdominal radiographic findings are not useful in differentiating between patients with and without biliary tract disease, although the selection of patients without biliary tract disease may have biased this finding.\r"

After selection in G418 sulfate, cell lines expressing the recombinant gene products were sorted by flow microfluorimetry, radioimmunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for fidelity as compared to the native viral glycoproteins. Two of the three genetically engineered cell lines (gI and gIV) could successfully serve as targets to detect bovine NK-like cytolysis. These findings support and extend a previous study from our laboratory indicating a role for BHV-1 glycoproteins in the cytolytic response by bovine NK-like cells. Additionally, this study demonstrated that individual proteins are recognized by these effector cells, and that recombinant glycoproteins can direct cytolytic activity in the absence of host cell infection-associated proteins. This is the first known report of Ag directed cytotoxicity by bovine null (non-B, non-T) cells.\r"

IFN-alpha producing cells (IPC) were identified through their content of IFN-alpha mRNA by in situ hybridization using a 35S-labeled IFN-alpha 2 cRNA probe. The IPC induced by HSV-infected WISH cells lacked capacity to adhere to and phagocytose latex particles. The induction of IFN-alpha by free infectious SV occurring in monocytes was abolished by phagocytosis of latex particles present in the cultures during the induction period. Such latex particles actually enhanced the IFN-alpha response induced by glutaraldehyde-fixed HSV- or SV-infected WISH cells or by free intact HSV. The HSV-induced IPC did not express the CD14 Ag expressed on monocytes. Cell sorting was performed on HSV-induced PBMC labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD3 and FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb. A small population consisting of 1.4% of all PBMC, which was CD3- but expressed low but significant levels of CD4, contained the majority of the IPC with a 50-fold increase of their frequency. This cell population had a forward- and right-angle light scatter different from typical monocytes/macrophages. The results therefore further delineate IPC among PBMC into monocytes, being stimulated by viruses such as SV. Another distinct population of infrequent but highly efficient IPC, tentatively designated natural IFN-alpha producing cells, is activated by stimuli such as HSV.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of humoral and cellular antitumor immune responses induced by immunization with tumor-derived idiotypic IgM were studied in a syngeneic, transplantable B cell lymphoma (38C13) of C3H mice. Id vaccination with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Id induced protection against a subsequent lethal tumor challenge. Such immunizations elicited anti-idiotypic antibodies that were cytotoxic in in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays as well as in vivo passive transfer experiments. L3T4+ T cells, which proliferated in vitro in response to the specific Id protein, were also induced. However, cells mediating direct cytotoxicity, either in vitro or in vivo, were not observed in the lymph nodes, spleens, or peritoneal cavity of immune mice or at the site of tumor regression as demonstrated by using a tumor sponge implantation model. In addition, in vitro sensitization of immune lymphocytes against 38C13 tumor cells failed to induce cytotoxicity. Immunization with lipid conjugated Id also elicited a T cell proliferative response but failed to induce anti-idiotypic antibodies and did not confer resistance to tumor growth. These results suggest that anti-idiotypic antibodies play the major role in the destruction of 38C13 tumor cells. However, in vivo depletion of L3T4+ or Lyt-2+ cells from 38C-Id-keyhole limpet hemocyanin-immunized mice resulted in diminished protection against a tumor challenge. Thus, although humoral responses appear to play the predominant part in tumor destruction, cellular responses are also required for the full expression of antitumor immunity in this system.\r"

  ".W": "The polyphenol group rutin (R) appears to influence isotype expression, because R-BSA conjugates induce anti-BSA responses in mice that show a significant decrease in hemagglutinating antibodies (HA) to BSA, as compared to mice immunized with BSA. However, the level of IgE antibodies to BSA is unaltered. To determine if suppressor cells for isotypes other than IgE are induced by R-BSA, cell transfers were performed. The results were consistent with the view that the decrease in HA titer to BSA in R-BSA immunized mice is not due to the activation of suppressor cells for isotypes other than IgE. Inasmuch as the IgE response in mice is associated with the production of IL-4 by Th2 cells, we analyzed the factors produced by spleen cells cultured with R-BSA. We found that supernatant from spleen cells cultured with R-BSA contained IL-4 as determined by the enhanced expression of Fc epsilon R (CD23) on B cells. This enhancement was inhibited by 11B11, the anti-IL-4 mAb. IL-2, a product of Th1 cells, was not detected in these supernatants. Moreover, IL-4 mRNA, but not IL-2 mRNA, was detected by Northern blot analysis of RNA from spleen cells cultured with R-BSA. Taken together the data suggest that the polyphenol containing compounds preferentially activate Th2 cells, thereby favoring IgE production.\r"

  ".U": "90324592\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of purified fibronectin to costimulate human T cell DNA synthesis was examined. Low concentrations of immobilized fibronectin, but not soluble fibronectin, augmented anti-CD3-induced proliferation of highly purified human T cells. In the absence of anti-CD3 stimulation, immobilized fibronectin did not induce T cell proliferation alone or in the presence of IL-2 or phorbol dibutyrate. Although fibronectin is present in high concentrations in the serum, immobilized fibronectin was able to costimulate T cell proliferation when cells were cultured in serum-containing medium. Immobilized collagen type I did not enhance anti-CD3 stimulated T cell responses, whereas gelatin (denatured collagen) and laminin were able to enhance anti-CD3 stimulated T cell responses modestly. The effects of gelatin, however, appeared to be indirect, because it could not enhance responses in medium devoid of fibronectin. Immobilized fibronectin enhanced anti-CD3 induced proliferation of both CD45RA dim and CD45RA bright subsets within both the CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations of T cells, although cells with the CD45RA dim phenotype were costimulated by lower concentrations of immobilized fibronectin. Enhancement of anti-CD3 induced proliferation by immobilized fibronectin was completely inhibited by a mAb to CD29, the integrin beta 1-chain (4B4) and not by a variety of other mAb. In contrast to its effects on proliferation, 4B4 only partially blocked T cell binding to anti-CD3 and fibronectin-coated macrowells. These findings suggested that the interaction between fibronectin and its receptor transduced a signal to the T cell and did not merely stabilize the interaction between anti-CD3 and the CD3 complex. Further experiments confirmed this observation. Thus fibronectin could enhance anti-CD3 responses when it was immobilized to a separate surface. The augmentation of anti-CD3 stimulated proliferation induced by immobilized fibronectin was also inhibited partially by mAb to either VLA-4 or VLA-5 and completely by a combination of the two mAb. The mAb to VLA-4 not only blocked the capacity of immobilized fibronectin to enhance anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation but also directly costimulated T cell responses. Thus, at least two fibronectin receptors are involved in fibronectin-mediated costimulation of T cell proliferation. These studies indicate that signals are transduced through the fibronectin receptors, VLA-4 and VLA-5, that augment T cell responses and therefore implicate the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin as an important influence regulating T cell responsiveness in vivo.\r"

However, there remains considerable controversy as to the precise route taken by the antigen and the MHC class II protein during this process. The unusual stability of Ag-MHC class II protein complexes has led to speculation that antigen can only associate with newly synthesized MHC class II molecules. An alternate possibility is that the MHC class II binding site can be regenerated within the cell during internalization and recycling of MHC class II proteins. To address these possibilities, three different murine B lymphoma lines were tested for their ability to process and present native protein Ag in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the protein export inhibitor, Brefeldin A. Both agents blocked the presentation of native OVA or native hen egg lysozyme to Ag-specific T cell hybridomas. No effect was seen on peptide presentation or on presentation to allo- or autoreactive T cells. Inasmuch as Brefeldin A has been previously shown to block protein export without affecting protein internalization or protein degradation in the endocytic pathway, the simplest interpretation of these data is that antigenic fragments generated in the APC after uptake by the endocytic pathway, preferentially associate with newly synthesized rather than mature MHC class II proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The action of human rIL-1 beta on confluent, quiescent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) has been studied for the induction of new membrane proteins. Two approaches have been taken. The first is a quantitative two-dimensional gel analysis of [35S]cysteine-labeled membrane proteins of HUVEC with and without cytokine treatment. This analysis indicates that there are a restricted number of new membrane proteins synthesized in the first 6 h of IL-1 treatment, on the order of 19 out of a total of over 600 detectable proteins. Second, we have prepared two mAb (1E7 and 2G7) to different epitopes of a major inducible sialoglycoprotein with molecular mass of 114 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.6 to 4.8. These antibodies were compared with two additional antibodies, 3B7 and 7A9, which were shown to react with the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) protein as expressed in COS cells. The 1E7/2G7 protein is distinct from ELAM-1, based upon biochemical comparisons as well as the inability of the 1E7 and 2G7 antibodies to react with ELAM-1-transfected COS cells. The protein defined as 1E7/2G7 is neither expressed constitutively nor in an inducible manner on PBMC, granulocytes, platelets, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes. The 7A9 and 3B7 antibodies are shown to block granulocyte binding to IL-1-activated HUVEC. The 2G7 antibody is effective at inhibiting the binding of T cells but not granulocytes to IL-1-activated endothelium, suggesting this new protein is an adhesion protein that may be active in vivo in T cell-endothelial cell adhesion-related events such as inflammation or lymphocyte recirculation. In addition, T cells were shown to utilize the ELAM-1 protein in binding to cytokine-activated HUVEC. Antibodies directed to both proteins had additive effects on inhibition of T cell adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "We recently demonstrated in vivo that IL-5 was an important mediator of eosinophilia in mice with parasite infections. In this study, we examined whether or not IL-5 was actually responsible for the eosinophilia induced by injection of human rIL-2. Mice administered hIL-2 developed eosinophilia during the course of the series of injections. This eosinophilia could be suppressed by a single injection of mAb against murine IL-5. The number of eosinophilic precursors increased more in the spleen cells of the IL-2-treated mice in comparison to the control mice, although in bone marrow precursors showed little change. Similarly, the number of granulocytic precursors increased markedly in the spleen cells of IL-2-treated mice. In vitro polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA subfragments corresponding to IL-5 mRNA (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), followed by Southern blot analysis, revealed enhancement of IL-5 mRNA expression in spleen cells 3 days after starting the human IL-2 injections. We also observed enhanced murine IL-5 mRNA expression in spleen cells stimulated with IL-2 in vitro. The level of murine IL-5 mRNA expression by IL-2-stimulated spleen cells from normal mice increased at 24 h, reached a plateau after 48 h, and decreased again within 72 h of starting culture. These results indicate that the eosinophilia induced by IL-2 in vivo is presumably mediated by IL-5 released from IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes.\r"

This was demonstrated by augmented binding of 125I-labeled R24 to the cell surface of GD3+ cells by unlabeled R24 and by direct binding of biotinylated R24 to R24 adsorbed on solid phase. Although homophilic binding was evident when R24 was bound to solid phase, R24-R24 aggregates could not be detected in solution under otherwise identical conditions. R24 bound to four other mAb (two IgG3, one IgG2a, one IgM) directed against GD3 but did not bind to a panel of 21 other mAb including other IgG3 mAb and mAb directed against non-GD3 ganglioside. Evidence implicating the GD3-binding site of R24 in homophilic binding included the following observations: 1) F(ab')2 fragments of R24 could bind to R24, 2) an antiidiotypic mAb against the GD3-binding site of R24 inhibited R24 homophilic binding, 3) an IgM anti-GD3 mAb also demonstrated homophilic binding to R24, and 4) homophilic binding was a function of immunoreactivity and avidity for GD3. R24 variants with 40-fold lower avidity for GD3 demonstrated a similar decrease in homophilic binding. Inasmuch as R24 bound to R24 F(ab')2 fragments and specifically to anti-GD3 mAb, it appeared that the target for homophilic binding was an epitope within the V region of anti-GD3 mAb. It is likely that homophilic interactions result in increased affinity of R24 for GD3 through increased effective valency of antibody-Ag complexes.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the recurrence of hydrophobic amino acids in a polypeptide at positions falling in an axial, hydrophobic strip if the sequence were coiled as an alpha helix, can lead to helical nucleation on a hydrophobic surface. The hydrophobic surface could anchor such residues, whereas the peptide sequence grows in a helical configuration that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds among carbonyl and amido NH groups along the peptidyl backbone of the helix, and by other intercycle interactions among amino acid side chains. Such bound, helical structures might protect peptides from proteases and/or facilitate transport to a MHC-containing compartment and thus be reflected in the selection of T cell-presented segments. Helical structure in a series of HPLC-purified peptides was estimated from circular dichroism measurements in: 1) 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2) that buffer with 45% trifluoroethanol (TFE), and 3) that buffer with di-O-hexadecyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles. By decreasing the dielectric constant of the buffer, TFE enhances intrapeptide interactions generally, whereas the lipid vesicles only provide a surface for hydrophobic interactions. The peptides varied in their strip-of-helix hydrophobicity indices (SOHHI; the mean Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicities of residues in an axial strip of an alpha helix) and in proline content. Structural order for peptides with helical circular dichroism spectra was estimated as percentage helicity from circular dichroism theta 222 nm values and peptide concentration. A prototypic alpha helical peptide with three cycles plus two amino acids and an axial hydrophobic strip of four leucyl residues (SOHHI = 3.8) was disordered in phosphate buffer, 58% helical in that buffer with 48% TFE, and 36% helical in that buffer with vesicles. Percentage helicity in the presence of vesicles of the subset of peptides without proline followed their SOHHI values. Peptides with multiple prolyl residues had circular dichroism spectra with strong signals, but since they did not have altered spectra in the presence of vesicles relative to phosphate buffer alone, the hydrophobic surface of the vesicle did not appear to stabilize those structures.\r"

To this end, mammalian expression vectors containing the rearranged MOPC 315 VH gene along with the H chain genes of various isotypes were constructed. These vectors were then transfected into the L chain-expressing MOPC 315.26 cell line to produce the rIg. The effect of polyvalency on the ability of Ig to bind anti-idiotypic antibodies was tested by comparing idiotypic expression in a competitive ELISA using reduced and nonreduced MOPC 315 IgA and IgM species. Reduction produced a two- to fivefold decrease in their ability to inhibit the binding of three anti-idiotypic antibodies, but not that of the functionally univalent antibody D10. In contrast, reduction of MOPC 315 IgG proteins did not affect the binding of the anti-Id mAb, indicating that reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds did not alter idiotypic expression. The expression of idiotopes on reduced mouse rIgA, IgM and IgG and human IgG MOPC 315 molecules was then compared. The results showed that both human and mouse IgG recombinant antibodies exhibited an enhanced expression of the idiotopes recognized by antibodies D10 and F1, as compared to MOPC 315 IgA and IgM molecules. In contrast, the expression of idiotopes recognized by A2 and G3 mAb was not influenced by the H chain isotype. These data support the hypothesis that the conformation of certain idiotopes is modulated by the isotype of the CH1 domain.\r"

Four monoclonal anti-Id preparations each inhibited the binding of the monoclonal anti-SV40 T-Ag Ab-1 preparation to SV40 T-Ag. These anti-Id preparations appeared to recognize similar idiotopes on the monoclonal anti-SV40 T-Ag Ab-1 based on competitive cross-inhibition studies. One of these anti-Id preparations, designated 57B, was examined further for its in vivo modulatory capacity in mice. This anti-Id induced an Ab-3 response in BALB/c mice that recognized SV40 T-Ag (Ag+) and expressed an Id that was shared by the monoclonal anti-SV40 T-Ag Ab-1 preparation (Id+). The Id expressed on the Ab-3 differed from the Id induced in BALB/c mice immunized with the nominal SV40 T-Ag. Furthermore, characterization of the humoral immune response induced by anti-Id immunization indicated that the Ab-3 also recognized different epitopes on SV40 T-Ag when compared to the anti-SV40 T-Ag Ab-1 preparation used to generate the anti-Id. These studies indicate that monoclonal anti-Id can be used to induce humoral immune responses to a viral encoded tumor-associated Ag in vivo with 1) and Id specificity that differs from that expressed on antibodies produced by immunization with the nominal Ag and 2) an epitope specificity distinct from the Ab-1 preparation used for the production of the anti-Id.\r"

We have investigated the role of protein kinases in IL-6-induced IgM secretion by SKW6.4 cells, an IL-6 responsive B cell line. IL-6-stimulated IgM production was inhibited by elevated intracellular cAMP induced either by the addition of dibutyryl cAMP or cholera toxin. The inhibitory effect of elevated intracellular cAMP was blocked by n-(2-(Methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonic dihydrochloride (H8), an inhibitor of protein kinase A. H8 did not affect IgM secretion induced by IL-6. In contrast, the addition of 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperizine dihydrochloride (H7), an inhibitor of protein kinase C activity, markedly inhibited IL-6-stimulated IgM production by SKW6.4 cells. H7 and elevated intracellular cAMP inhibited IgM mRNA expression and subsequent IgM synthesis by SKW6.4 cells. SKW6.4 proliferation, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, was not markedly affected by IL-6, dibutyryl cAMP, cholera toxin, H7 or H8. PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, directly stimulated significant IgM secretion by SKW6.4 cells. When added to PMA-stimulated SKW6.4 cells, IL-6 stimulated additional IgM production. This observation suggested that IL-6 could stimulate differentiation without activating protein kinase C. This was confirmed by demonstrating that IL-6 did not stimulate production of diacylglycerol, did not induce the translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and could induce SKW6.4 cells to produce IgM after depletion of their cellular protein kinase C by PMA. Taken together these results suggests that IL-6-stimulated IgM production requires utilization of an H7-inhibitable protein kinase that can be inhibited by a protein kinase A-dependent pathway. Despite the fact that PMA can stimulate IgM production in SKW6.4 cells, IL-6 appears to use a protein kinase pathway other than protein kinase C to induce IgM production.\r"

  ".U": "90324616\r", 
  ".W": "Although mucins provide lubrication and physical protection for epithelial cell surfaces, other functional roles for these large glycoproteins are unknown. One human mucin, designated DF3 Ag, is detectable on apical surfaces of normal epithelial secretory cells and in normal milk, urine, and plasma. The present studies have examined the effects of DF3 Ag purified from both normal and malignant sources on the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of Schistosoma mansoni by eosinophils (ADCC-E) and on the adherence of eosinophils to inert antibody-coated targets. DF3 Ag purified from tissue culture supernatant of a human breast carcinoma cell line or from human milk inhibited ADCC-E in a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibitory activity at 3 to 10 micrograms/ml. Inhibition of ADCC-E was specific for the DF3 mucin, because no inhibition was observed with two other unrelated, circulating glycoproteins: carcinoembryonic Ag and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Inhibition was not a result of direct cytotoxicity of the DF3 Ag for eosinophils, as demonstrated by the lack of detectable effect of the mucin on cellular trypan blue exclusion or PMA-induced H2O2 release. The inhibitory effect was time dependent, requiring the presence of DF3 Ag in the ADCC-E culture for at least 4 h, beginning within the first 2 h of eosinophil-schistosomula interaction. Furthermore, inhibition was not a result of interaction between DF3 Ag and the activating lymphokine. These data suggest that inhibition of ADCC-E by DF3 Ag is a result of interference of adhesion of eosinophils to Ig-coated targets. In this regard, purified DF3 tumor Ag prevents eosinophil adherence to human Ig-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads. Preincubation of the inert Ig-coated targets with DF3 Ag did not inhibit subsequent eosinophil adherence, suggesting that DF3 Ag interacts with a moiety present on the eosinophil. Inhibition of adhesion occurred at 37 degrees C, but was also observed at 4 degrees C. These results suggest that DF3 Ag acts as an immunomodulating agent. Because activated eosinophils can damage surrounding normal tissues as well as infectious organisms, DF3 Ag may serve to protect secretory epithelium from the cytotoxic effects of activated inflammatory cells.\r"

  ".U": "90324617\r", 
  ".W": "The CD4R has been shown to exert variable effects on T cell activation responses. Depending on the manner of ligation, the CD4R has been demonstrated to have positive as well as negative effects on the generation of [Ca2+]i flux by the CD3R. Coaggregation of CD3 with CD4 enhanced Ca2+ flux while their independent ligation and aggregation diminished this response. To further elucidate these paradoxical CD4 effects, we studied induction of a microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase (MAP-2K) activity during ligation of the CD3R. Lymphoid MAP-2K activation by CD3 is an evanescent event that is dependent on phosphorylation of 43-kDa MAP-2K via a pathway that involves protein kinase C. Coaggregation of CD4 and CD3 with cross-linking antibodies and avidin enhanced the CD3-mediated MAP-2K response almost twofold. In contrast, independent ligation and cross-linking of CD4 reduced the CD3-induced MAP-2K response by approximately 50%. An important requirement for this inhibitory effect was that CD4 be ligated before stimulation with anti-CD3. The negative effect of anti-CD4 mAb was specific as other mAb failed to simulate this event. The PMA-induced MAP-2K response was not inhibited by anti-CD4. Intact 32P-labeled Jurkat and normal human T cells demonstrated the appearance of a single 43-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein during stimulation with PMA and anti-CD3. When these crude cellular extracts were extensively fractionated across DEAE- and hydrophobic columns, MAP-2K was resolved into two peaks of activity, each containing a single tyrosine phosphoprotein around 43 kDa. In addition to tyrosine-specific labeling, mitogenic stimulation of normal human T cells also induced threonine-specific labeling of MAP-2K. These results imply that activation of lymphoid MAP-2K is a dual process requiring at least two independent kinases for optimal activity. Inasmuch as CD3 activates protein kinase C and CD4 is associated with a tyrosine kinase, pp56lck, we suggest that their coaggregation may create the conditions whereby MAP-2K may be activated by dual phosphorylation. Independent aggregation of these receptors may lead to physical separation and breakdown of this interactive mechanism.\r"

Over 7 days the animals received total doses of 0.5, 1, 4.5, 9, or 28 micrograms PAF or the solvent alone. The spleen mononuclear cells isolated from Ficoll gradients and the adherent cell fraction were separated before determination of basal and mitogen-stimulated IL-1 and IL-2 production, respectively. Adherent splenocytes from rats having received 28 micrograms PAF exhibited a decreased capability to produce IL-1, as compared to those from vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, adherent splenocytes from rats having received 9 and 4.5 micrograms PAF yielded higher amounts of released and cell-associated IL-1 activity upon LPS stimulation, as compared to those from solvent-treated animals. The PAF antagonist, BN 52021, given orally (5 mg/kg, twice a day throughout the experiments) inhibited the in vivo effect of 28 micrograms PAF. Statistically significant 144 +/- 43% (p less than 0.001, n = 5) and 73 +/- 33%, (p less than 0.01, n = 3) increases in IL-2 production were observed when whole spleen mononuclear cells from rats administered with 1 and 4.5 micrograms PAF, respectively, were stimulated with Con A. BN 52021 markedly inhibited the in vivo effect of 1 microgram PAF on the IL-2 release. Our study demonstrates that PAF can modulate immune functions in vivo and suggests that the specific PAF antagonist, BN 52021, may be used as an immunomodulatory agent.\r"

  ".W": "BALB/c-H-2dm2 mice (H-2KdI-AdI-EdDd), a congenic strain of BALB/c mice, have a deletion of the class I MHC Ag, H-2Ld. This gene encodes the exclusive class I MHC-restricting gene product for vesicular stomatitis virus-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes. When dm2 mice were immunized with infectious vesicular stomatitis virus, a specific CTL response was generated. These CTL lysed VSV-infected targets that expressed Iad gene products, but not VSV-infected Iad- targets. The CTL were used initially as long term cytolytic lines; 13 CTL clones were derived by limit dilution. All of the clones expressed the phenotype CD3+, CD4+, CD8-; some clones expressed TCR that are members of the V beta 8 family, others did not. The clones were restricted by class II MHC Ag, both I-Ad and I-Ed serving as restricting elements for individual clones of the panel. All of the clones derived from dm2 mice were specific for the immunizing serotype, Indiana, of VSV and did not lyse syngeneic cells infected with VSV of the New Jersey serotype. Studies using defective interfering virus particles, UV light-inactivated virus, and purified micelles of the viral glycoprotein indicated that infectious virus was not required for sensitization of target cells for immune recognition by the class II MHC-restricted CTL clones. Additional studies using recombinant vaccinia virus vectors to sensitize targets confirmed the specificity of the clones for the viral glycoprotein. These studies also demonstrated a cryptic population of class II-restricted CTL in BALB/c lines specific for VSV G. Naturally occurring variant viruses and mutant viruses, selected for escape from neutralization by mAb, were used in an effort to map the determinant(s) recognized; on the basis of patterns of target cell lysis, three groups of epitopes recognized by the clones were defined. Therefore, in the absence of the class I MHC Ag required for a CTL response to VSV, dm2 mice generated CTL with the CD4+ phenotype that recognized different epitopes on the viral glycoprotein, and lysed cells in a class II-MHC restricted, Ag-specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Glucan receptors are present on mammalian phagocytic cells and provide an important physiologic mechanism for opsonin-independent clearance of yeasts and fungi. To prepare an immunologic probe to human monocyte beta-glucan receptors, an approach was taken that focused on the ligand specificity of the receptors as expressed by an anti-Id. The algal beta-glucan laminarin was chemically coupled to protein carriers to prepare an immunogenic beta-glucan. Three mouse IgG2a mAb were raised against laminarin, and one, mAb OEA10, exhibited specificity for the soluble unit ligand yeast heptaglucoside and the ligands present on zymosan and glucan particles that are recognized by monocyte beta-glucan receptors. These findings prompted usage of mAb OEA10 as immunogen for the preparation of an anti-Id. The resulting rabbit antiserum was subjected to sequential immunoaffinity chromatography to purify anti-idiotypic antibodies. The final product contained only IgG by SDS-PAGE and was shown to be specific by its selectively blocking binding of 125I-mAb OEA10 to laminarin. Pretreatment of adherent monocytes with 0.4 micrograms/ml of the anti-Id reduced the numbers of monocytes ingesting zymosan and glucan particles by 64 and 43%, respectively, whereas ingestion of IgG-coated SRBC was unaffected by as much as 16 micrograms/ml of the anti-Id. Incubation of adherent monocytes with increasing amounts of 125I-anti-Id in the absence and presence of 40-fold molar excess unlabeled anti-Id revealed dose-dependent specific binding, which approached plateau levels with 1 microgram/ml of labeled anti-Id. Thus, the anti-Id binds to monocytes and displays functional characteristics of soluble beta-glucan ligands, indicating that some of the anti-idiotypic antibodies recognize epitopes within monocyte beta-glucan receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiology of hepatitis B in female prostitutes was studied in a cross-sectional survey of 467 prostitutes and 510 control prenatal clinic patients from Lima and Iquitos, Peru. Prostitutes reported a mean of 8.8 +/- 6.7 years of active prostitution and a mean of 205 +/- 137 sexual contacts in the month prior to the study. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was found in comparable percentages of prostitutes (1.7%) and controls (0.8%; P = .305). In contrast, seropositivity for both antigen and antibody markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs, or anti-hepatitis B core) was found in a significantly higher percentage of prostitutes than controls (67.0% vs. 10.0%; P less than .0001). By multivariate analysis, both prostitution (odds ratio [OR] 14.6) and the number of years of exposure as a prostitute (OR 3.2 for 10 years of exposure at age 35 years) were significantly associated with seropositivity for hepatitis B markers when adjusted for age. In this study, the prevalence of HBsAg was not substantially increased in highly active female prostitutes compared with the general population, even though hepatitis B transmission was greatly increased. These data suggest that in adult women with a high level of hepatitis B infection, hepatitis B antigenemia may not persist as frequently as previously indicated in studies of other populations.\r"

Detection of antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2 was based on an immunodot assay using type-specific glycoproteins gG-1 and gG-2. Serologic and historical data at enrollment were analyzed for 4527 subjects; the seroprevalence of HSV-2 was 21.6%. By multivariate analysis, HSV-2 infection as determined by seroprevalence was significantly and independently associated with age, years of sexual activity, race, one or more episodes of other genital infections, lower annual family income, and multiple sexual partners. The presence of antibody to HSV-1 was associated with a lower frequency of antibody to HSV-2, suggesting that developed immunity to HSV-1 protected against HSV-2 infection. Of 926 participants who had antibody to HSV-2, only 117 (12.6%) reported a history of genital herpes. Hence the vast majority of HSV-2 infections were inapparent. Although seroprevalence of HSV-2 was higher among black (35.4%) than white (18.5%) women, black women appeared to have significantly less symptomatic genital herpes than white women (7.7% vs. 14.7%, P less than .01).\r"

This cross-sectional multistage probability sample survey included sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behavior patterns, disease history, and HSV type-specific antibody status. The prevalence of HSV-1 antibody was 37.2% in freshmen and 46.1% in fourth-year students; that for HSV-2 antibody was 0.4% and 4.3%, respectively. A history of cold sores was obtained in 25.6% of the freshmen; none had a history of manifest genital herpes. A history of cold sores was obtained in 28% and a history of genital herpes in 1.1% of the fourth-year students. The case-weighted prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies was found to be significantly elevated for a number of student characteristics. However, multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that the significant predictors of HSV-1 antibodies in this population were female gender, black race, first intercourse at age less than or equal to 15 years, total years of sexual activity, history of a partner with oral sores, and a personal history of a non-HSV sexually transmitted disease (STD). Predictors of HSV-2 antibody were black race, duration of sexual activity, and history of a non-HSV STD.\r"

Latent recombinant viruses were recovered from some ganglia innervating the sites of inoculation. Monkeys protected from lethal infection with wild-type virus exhibit recurrent lesions that increase in frequency and severity after total lymphoid gamma irradiation (TLI). In contrast, monkeys immunosuppressed by TLI and inoculated with R7020 could not be differentiated from irradiated controls with respect to morbidity or mortality. Moreover, the virus was not transmitted from immunosuppressed infected females to normal male cage mates.\r"

Seven additional patients had possible HSV-2-induced recurrent meningitis. In contrast to the first episode of meningitis, virus isolation, HSV antigen detection, and IgG analyses in consecutive serum samples were of no diagnostic value in episodes of HSV-2-induced recurrent meningitis.

Cells infected with the gC1 mutant were more susceptible to cytolysis mediated by antibody and complement or complement alone. The gC1 or gD1 genes were expressed in mammalian cells under the control of an inducible promoter. Cells induced to express gC1 resisted complement cytolysis, while cells expressing gD1 did not. gC1 modified cytolysis of virus-infected or -transfected cells by blocking alternative complement pathway activation. gC1 also modified complement-dependent virus neutralization, which was mediated by inhibiting the classical complement pathway. These results indicate a protective role for gC1 on the virion and at the cell surface.\r"

HIV-1 infection ranged from 5% in New Orleans to 48% in New York City. Hispanics and blacks had a significantly higher rate of HIV-1 infection than whites (P less than .01), but within each group rates were similar between males and females and by age stratum. HTLV-I/II seroprevalence increased with age from 3% in the 20-29 year age group to 37% in the group greater than 50 years. New Orleans and Manhattan (24%) had the highest rate, and blacks (19%) had a higher rate than either Hispanics (6.3%) or whites (7.3%). No association between HIV-1 and HTLV-I/II infection was observed except in Manhattan. When compared with iv drug abusers infected only with HIV-1, dually infected subjects had more clinical symptoms related to immune deficiency but a lower prevalence of HIV antigenemia. These data document the frequent occurrence of retroviral infections in iv drug abusers. The contrast between the two classes of virus suggests that HIV-1 is more efficiently transmitted, while the age-dependent rise in HTLV-I/II seroprevalence suggests cumulative exposure of a less-transmissible agent.\r"

Viremia or excretion preceded disease onset by a median of 15 days among those in whom excretion occurred first. In stepwise time-dependent proportional hazards regression analyses, CMV viremia and positive serology before transplant were predictive for both CMV pneumonia and gastrointestinal disease. Oropharyngeal excretion was independently predictive for gastrointestinal disease but not pneumonia. Urinary excretion was not independently predictive. Acute graft-versus-host disease was predictive for pneumonia but not gastrointestinal disease. Thus use of CMV excretion, particularly viremia, as a marker to determine the initiation of antiviral chemotherapy could be effective in preventing progression of infection to serious disease. However, with standard virologic techniques this strategy would not be effective in patients (32% in this study) without CMV excretion detected before the onset of pneumonia or gastrointestinal disease.\r"

A decrease in the amount of IL-1 beta secreted as measured by ELISA was also detected. The amount of IL-1 beta secreted by HCMV-challenged cells was always greater than that produced by control cultures at similar times. Despite containing higher levels of IL-1 beta, supernatants from challenged cells were markedly less effective in supporting thymocyte proliferation.

  ".W": "A rabbit model of catheter-related bacteremia was developed to study immunity to the capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (PS/A) of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Catheters colonized by coagulase-negative staphylococci were inserted into the right jugular vein and attached to a subcutaneous osmotic pump, and blood cultures were obtained over 14 days. Nonimmune rabbits were bacteremic for 6-8 days after infection, hypoglycemic, and hyperlipidemic and had strong immune responses to teichoic acid but not to PS/A. PS/A immunization, but not teichoic acid immunization, reduced the number of bacteremic days by approximately 60%, diminished the hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia, and ablated the immune responses to teichoic acid. Passive infusion of PS/A-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies using a separate, noninfected catheter-pump combination implanted in the left jugular protected against both bacteremia and hematogenous colonization of this contralateral catheter.\r"

  ".W": "The neuraxes of 26 pigs inoculated intravenously with a pathogenic isolate of Streptococcus suis type 2 and killed 17-47 h later were examined using histologic and scanning microscopic techniques. The only pathologic lesions detected in all pigs were associated with the choroid plexus: disruption of the plexus brush border, a decrease in the number of Kolmer cells, and exudation of fibrin and inflammatory cells into the ventricles. Lesions affecting the cerebral and choroid plexus endothelium, such as vasculitis, were not detected. Intracellular bacteria were demonstrated in the parenchyma of the choroid plexus, in the ventricular exudate, and within peripheral blood monocytes. Separate studies found that circulating monocytes containing phagocytosed bacteria-sized particles migrated into the cerebrospinal fluid compartment with the choroid plexus acting as a major site of cellular ingress. These observations support the concept that in the pathogenesis of meningitis, bacteria may gain access to the cerebrospinal fluid compartment in association with monocytes migrating along normal pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Studies relating opsonization and IgG antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae have yielded contradictory results. This study compared changes in opsonization with IgG subclass response after vaccinating healthy subjects with a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Total IgG and IgG subclass antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharide types 8, 9, and 19 were measured by ELISA. Opsonic activity was assayed using 3H-labeled bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in different serum concentrations (5%-40%). A substantial postvaccination increase in total and subclass IgG antibody was observed in most subjects, although variations were seen. Postvaccination sera generally gave rise to enhanced opsonization, and a correlation was found between increases in antibody levels and opsonization. This correlation was closest for IgG1 and IgG4 and generally strongest at the lowest serum concentration, but weak or absent at the highest concentration. Thus, vaccination against S. pneumoniae stimulates a variable increase in specific opsonic activity in health persons that is best demonstrated when serum is a limiting factor in the opsonin assay.\r"

  ".U": "90324675\r", 
  ".W": "Parenteral drug abusers are the second largest group at risk for developing AIDS (25% of US cases) and a major risk group for infection with both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the HBV-dependent RNA hepatitis delta virus (HDV). This study was conducted to determine the prevalence in 1984-1985 and relationships of HDV and HBV infections in 372 unselected parenteral drug abusers without AIDS or symptoms related to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (but 49% of whom were positive for HIV-1 antibodies) and in 53 drug abusers hospitalized with AIDS. The prevalence of HDV markers in the combined study groups was 20%; 81% of study subjects with hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg) had one marker for HDV infection. Significant differences were found between patients with and without AIDS with respect to the prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen (5.7% vs. 0.8%, P less than .05) and antibody (0 vs. 21.4%, P less than .01) and HBsAg (15.1% vs. 5.1%, P less than .05). The significantly higher prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen and HBsAg in subjects with AIDS suggests that persistence or reactivation of these viruses is significantly greater among parenteral drug abusers with AIDS than among those without AIDS. These findings, along with the absence of hepatitis delta antibodies in the drug abusers with AIDS, are probably related to the profound general immunosuppression that occurs in AIDS.\r"
