  ".W": "The M-current (IM) is a time- and voltage-dependent K+ current that persists at slightly depolarized membrane potentials. IM is reduced by muscarinic cholinergic agonists and certain peptides, and is thought to be responsible in part for the slow and late slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials in sympathetic neurons. Recently, we reported that IM in hippocampal neurons was also augmented by somatostatin-14 and -28 suggesting that two different receptors reciprocally regulate one neuronal channel type. Muscarinic effects on IM may be mediated by various components of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate pathway. We now report the involvement of a different second messenger pathway, that generated by phospholipase A2, in the somatostatin-induced augmentation of IM in hippocampal cells. This pathway generates arachidonic acid from which leukotrienes can be produced by lipoxygenases. We find that the IM-augmenting effects of somatostatin are abolished by two substances that can inhibit phospholipase A2, quinacrine and 4-bromophenacyl bromide, and that both arachidonic acid and leukotriene C4 mimic the effects of somatostatin-14 on hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro. Arachidonic and somatostatin effects are blocked by a lipoxygenase inhibitor, implicating an arachidonic acid metabolite, perhaps a leukotriene, in the somatostatin effect.\r"

Presentation of foreign peptides by APC takes place when many class II molecules may be occupied by autologous peptides. We have now estimated the number of specific peptide/class II complexes per APC by quantitative immunoprecipitation of I-Ak after pulsing the APC with stimulatory levels of a radioactive immunogenic peptide derived from hen egg-white lysozyme protein. T cells were activated by APC that expressed as few as 210-340 specific peptide/class II complexes (0.1% of the I-Ak molecules). These figures were confirmed using anti-CD3 antibody bound to latex beads as an alternative activating ligand. This low number explains the simultaneous presentation of multiple foreign antigens, even in the face of peptide competition.\r"

By use of a three-vessel occlusion model, ischemic brain edema was produced in the rat brain by 15 minutes of global ischemia followed by recirculation. Water content was measured by means of a drying/weighing method; sodium and potassium contents were measured by means of flame photometry. The effects of intraventricular administration of ANP were evaluated by a comparison between the groups given 2 and 5 micrograms of atriopeptin II (treated) and those given 0.9% NaCl (sham-treated). The treated groups showed significant decreases in brain water (P less than 0.02) and sodium (P less than 0.01) contents at 15 and 30 minutes after recirculation, whereas the brain potassium contents remained unaltered. Before ischemia and immediately after 15 minutes of ischemia, intraventricularly administered ANP did not significantly change the brain water, sodium, or potassium contents. There was no significant difference in the effect on the amount of brain water and sodium between the two doses (2 and 5 micrograms). These effects of ANP were thought not to be mediated by primary changes in serum osmolality and sodium and potassium concentrations, because intraventricular administration of ANP did not change them significantly. The present results reveal that, in ischemic brain edema, ANP may act directly on the central nervous system to inhibit brain water and sodium accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce the synthesis and cotranslational myristoylation of an 82-kDa specific protein kinase C substrate in human neutrophils. The myristic acid is covalently bound via a hydroxylamine-resistant amide linkage to the N-terminal glycine of the protein. The isoelectric point of the protein is at pH 4.6. The protein is rapidly phosphorylated when neutrophils are stimulated with chemotactic agonists or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, and displays two characteristic phosphopeptides in one- and two-dimensional separation systems. Identical phosphopeptides were detected when the 82-kDa protein was phosphorylated in vitro with purified kinase C. The 82-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by a polyclonal antiserum raised against the 87-kDa specific protein kinase C substrate from bovine brain. From these biochemical and immunological criteria it is concluded that the 82-kDa protein is the human neutrophil homolog of MARCKS, the myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate previously described in bovine and rat brain and in murine fibroblasts and macrophages. TNF-alpha and LPS prime human neutrophils for potentiated protein kinase C-dependent responses such as the respiratory burst and exocytosis. Consistent with this, these mediators do not induce the phosphorylation of MARCKS but prime the neutrophils for enhanced phosphorylation of this protein when the cells subsequently encounter activators of protein kinase C. This increase in MARCKS phosphorylation can be explained by the elevated levels of the protein observed in TNF-alpha- or LPS-treated neutrophils. Indeed, MARCKS constitutes 90% of all proteins synthesized in response to TNF-alpha or LPS. These data strongly suggest that MARCKS acts as a critical effector molecule in the transduction pathway of these important inflammatory mediators.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) residues on cytoplasmic and nuclear glycoproteins. Labeled lectin and enzymatic techniques have been used to identify O-GlcNAc-bearing proteins, but no antibodies generally reactive with such O-linked GlcNAc moieties have been described. We have previously characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the GlcNAc residues of streptococcal group A carbohydrate, which is composed of a polyrhamnose backbone with GlcNAc side chains. We now report that these mAbs recognize O-GlcNAc-bearing proteins. By immunofluorescence, the mAbs reacted strongly with the nuclear periphery and nucleoplasm of mammalian cells and stained the cytoplasm less intensely. The distribution was not consistent with labeling of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, or plasma membrane. Furthermore, the staining pattern of a mutant cell line, which retains terminal GlcNAc residues on many N-linked glycans, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells. Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were inhibited by free GlcNAc and were completely abolished by galactosylation of terminal GlcNAc residues. Indirect ELISA demonstrated GlcNAc- and galactosylation-inhibitable binding of the mAbs to a 65-kDa human erythrocyte cytosolic protein known to contain O-GlcNAc. Thus, these mAbs react with O-GlcNAc without apparent influence of peptide determinants, do not show detectable binding to N- or O-glycans, and, therefore, represent a valuable tool for the study of O-GlcNAc moieties. In addition, these mAbs provide the first cytologic analysis of the distribution of O-GlcNAc residues throughout the nucleus and the cytoplasm of mammalian cells.\r"

  ".W": "There is little known about the regulation of gene expression by ionizing radiation exposure. The present studies demonstrate transcriptional activation of a mammalian gene, the c-jun protooncogene, by x-rays. The c-jun gene encodes a component of the AP-1 protein complex and is important in early signaling events involved in various cellular functions. The increase in c-jun transcripts by ionizing radiation was time- and dose-dependent as determined by Northern blot analysis. Transcriptional run-on analysis demonstrated that ionizing radiation stimulates the rate of c-jun gene transcription. Furthermore, the half-life of c-jun RNA was prolonged in the absence of protein synthesis. These findings indicate that the increase in c-jun RNA observed after irradiation is regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Moreover, the induction of c-jun by ionizing radiation was associated with an inverse dose rate effect in that decreasing the dose rate resulted in increased c-jun expression. The present results similarly demonstrate that ionizing radiation increases levels of c-fos transcripts as well as that of jun-B, another member of the jun family. Taken together, these results suggest a role for induction of early response genes in the pathophysiologic effects of ionizing radiation.\r"

The region of greatest divergence falls within three 112-amino acid repeats spanning residues 259-589. Interestingly, nematode vinculin lacks one of these central repeats. The regions of human vinculin that are N- and C-terminal to the repeats show 54% and 61% sequence identity, respectively, to nematode vinculin. Southern blots of human genomic DNA hybridized with short vinculin cDNA fragments indicate that there is a single vinculin gene.

  ".W": "In the presence of a single-stranded-DNA-binding protein (SSB), the elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) is dependent on ATP and two protein factors, activator 1 (A1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We have examined the interaction of these proteins with (dA)4500.(dT)12-18 by measuring their ability to form stable complexes with this DNA. In the presence of ATP, A1, PCNA, and pol delta formed a stable complex with DNA that could be isolated by gel filtration. Incubation of the isolated complex with dTTP resulted in the synthesis of poly(dT). While ATP was required for the formation of this complex, it was not required for the subsequent elongation of DNA. The temporal requirements for complex formation were determined. A1 was found to bind first, followed by the ATP-dependent addition of PCNA to the A1.DNA complex, while pol delta was added last. Each of these complexes could be isolated by gel filtration, indicating that they possessed a high degree of stability. The binding of PCNA to the A1-SSB-coated primed DNA occurred with adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate as well as ATP. However, the binding of pol delta to the PCNA.A1-DNA complex was observed only when the latter complex was formed in the presence of ATP. The complete complex was formed after incubation at 37 degrees C for 2 min, whereas no complex was detected after incubation at 0 degree C. These results indicate that these proteins act in a manner analogous to the accessory proteins that play critical roles in the elongation reaction catalyzed by T4 phage DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III.\r"

  ".W": "The Rab3A protein belongs to a large family of small GTP-binding proteins that are present in eukaryotic cells and that share amino acid identities with the Ras proteins (products of the ras protooncogenes). Rab3A, which is specifically located in nervous and endocrine tissues, is suspected to play a key role in secretion. Its localization was investigated in bovine adrenal gland by using a polyclonal antibody. Rab3A was detected in adrenal medulla but not in adrenal cortex. In cultured adrenal medulla cells. Rab3A was specifically expressed in the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells. Subcellular fractionation suggested that Rab3A is about 30% cytosolic and that particulate Rab3A is associated with the membrane of chromaffin granules (the catecholamine storage organelles) and with a second compartment likely to be the plasma membrane. The Rab3A localization on chromaffin granule membranes was confirmed by immunoadsorption with an antibody against dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Rab3A was not extracted from this membrane by NaCl or KBr but was partially extracted by urea and totally solubilized by Triton X-100, suggesting either an interaction with an intrinsic protein or a membrane association through fatty acid acylation. This study suggests that Rab3A, which may also be located on other secretory vesicles containing noncharacterized small GTP-binding proteins, is involved in their biogenesis or in the regulated secretion process.\r"

There is a linear relationship between the reciprocal of mean open time and blocker concentration within the range of 1 to 25 microM. The reciprocal of mean blocked time does not change with arachidonic acid concentration. Other cis unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic, linoleic, and ricinoleic acids, demonstrate similar blocks. Trans unsaturated acids such as elaidic acid and saturated fatty acids, including stearic, palmitic, and myristic acids, do not inhibit the channel at 20 microM. Ricinoleic acid decreases short circuit current in T84 cells, a colonic carcinoma cell line that secretes Cl-. Our results suggest that the direct effect of arachidonic and other fatty acids on Cl- secretion is to block Cl- channel current.\r"

Removal of the C-terminal sequence to residue 58 had little influence, but truncation to residue 50 decreased the association to low levels and removal to residue 36 was even more effective. However, a mutant missing the segment between residues 35 and 66 was fully functional, but, when the C-terminal segment from residue 36 was replaced with a noncytochrome c sequence, the high-affinity phase of the association was lost. A mutant in which residues 90, 91, 92, 96, and 100 were replaced by lysine, leucine, proline, proline, and proline, respectively, to prevent the possible formation of the C-terminal alpha-helix and another mutant in which the C-terminal segment from residue 90 to residue 120 was a noncytochrome c sequence had normal association. In contrast, replacing lysine-5, -7, and -8 by glutamine, glutamic acid, and asparagine, respectively, resulted in loss of the high-affinity phase. The same mutations in the apoprotein lacking the segment between residues 35 and 66 caused, in addition, a decrease of the low-affinity phase association. Thus, the N-terminal region is most critical for apocytochrome c association, but alternative segments of the central and/or C-terminal region can be utilized, where noncytochrome c sequences are ineffective. These results emphasize the wide disparity between the structural requirements for association with mitochondria and for the production of a functional holoprotein.\r"

Changing Glu-13S (numbering used is that of the spinach enzyme) to Val, Trp-67S to Arg, Pro-73S to His, or Tyr-98S to Asn prevented accumulation of stable holoenzyme. Interpretation of these results using a model for the three-dimensional structure of the spinach enzyme based on x-ray crystallographic data suggests that our small subunit mutants containing substitutions at positions 13S and 67S probably do not assemble because of mispairing or nonpairing of charged residues on the interfacing surfaces of the large and small subunits. The failure of small subunits substituted at positions 73S or 98S to assemble correctly may result from disruption of intersubunit or intrasubunit hydrophobic pockets, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "We report that 11 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive patients, including three AIDS patients, were able to generate a cellular immune response to the intradermal injection of low doses (2-10 micrograms) of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2). A dose-dependent zone of induration appeared at the site of injection, peaked at 24 hr, and was accompanied by the local accumulation of T cells, monocytes, and Langerhans cells. Despite the reductions in the CD4+ T-cell counts in the peripheral blood of most patients, CD4+ T-cells could still be mobilized with rIL-2 injections into the skin. The total number of immigrant cells was equivalent to those in HIV-1-seronegative patients, although the CD4+/CD8+ ratio of the dermal population was reduced. In response to rIL-2, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen was expressed on the surface of keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. In addition, the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-induced protein IP-10 rapidly appeared in dermal inflammatory cells and keratinocytes. A majority of HIV-1-seropositive patients demonstrated low or absent responses to common skin-test antigens. Those with positive zones of induration were often defective in the cellular expression of the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II antigen. The simultaneous administration of rIL-2 and soluble antigen at widely separated cutaneous sites led to an enhancement of skin-test antigen reactivity in seropositive patients. The results suggest that local administration of rIL-2 to seropositive patients may act systemically, stimulating cellular immunity to recall antigens, and thus may be of potential benefit in the defense against opportunistic pathogens encountered in HIV-1 infection.\r"

Rather than isolating NFTs, we selected for PHF populations that can be extracted from AD brain homogenates. About 50% of PHF immunoreactivity can be obtained in 27,200 x g supernatants following homogenization in buffers containing 0.8 M NaCl. We further enriched for PHFs by taking advantage of their insolubility in the presence of zwitterionic detergents and 2-mercaptoethanol, removal of aggregates by filtration through 0.45-microns filters, and sucrose density centrifugation. PHF-enriched fractions contained two to five proteins of 57-68 kDa that displayed the same antigenic properties as PHFs. Since the 57- to 68-kDa PHF proteins are antigenically related to tau proteins, they are similar to the tau proteins previously observed in NFTs. However, further analysis revealed that PHF-associated tau can be distinguished from normal, soluble tau by PHF antibodies that do not recognize human adult tau and by one- and two-dimensional PAGE.\r"

Correction in both extract systems is strand specific, being highly biased to the incised DNA strand. Different mispairs within a homologous set of heteroduplexes were processed with different efficiencies (G.T greater than G.G approximately equal to A.C greater than C.C), and correction was accompanied by mismatch-dependent DNA synthesis localized to the region spanning the mispair and the strand break, thus demonstrating that mismatch recognition is associated with the repair reaction. Correction of each of these heteroduplexes was abolished by aphidicolin but was relatively insensitive to the presence of high concentrations of ddTTP, indicating probable involvement of alpha and/or delta class DNA polymerase(s). These findings suggest that higher eukaryotic cells possess a general, strand-specific mismatch repair system analogous to the Escherichia coli mutHLS and the Streptococcus pneumoniae hexAB pathways, systems that contribute in a major way to the genetic stability of these bacterial species.\r"

In the present study, 3H-methylated G beta gamma complexes cleaved to their constituent amino acids by exhaustive proteolysis were shown to contain radiolabeled material that coeluted with geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester on reversed-phase HPLC and two TLC systems. Further treatment by performic acid oxidation yielded radiolabeled material that coeluted with L-cysteic acid methyl ester, verifying that the prenyl modification occurs on a C-terminal cysteine residue. Analysis by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry of material released from purified G beta gamma by treatment with Raney nickel positively identified the covalently bound lipid as an all-trans-geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoid moiety. To delineate the distribution of this modification among gamma subunits, purified G beta gamma complexes were separated into 5-kDa (gamma 5) and 6-kDa (gamma 6) forms of the gamma polypeptide by reversed-phase HPLC. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analyses of Raney nickel-treated purified gamma 5 and gamma 6 subunits showed that both polypeptides were modified by geranylgeranylation. These results demonstrate that at least two forms of brain gamma subunit are posttranslationally modified by geranylgeranylation and carboxyl methylation. These modifications may be important for targeting G beta gamma complexes to membranes.\r"

PC-12 cells were incubated with the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonolactone. The beta and gamma subunits were isolated by specific association with an affinity column of immobilized alpha subunits. The gamma subunits were radiolabeled, and the tritiated lipid released from them by treatment with methyl iodide comigrated chromatographically with the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranylgeraniol. Label was not detected in G protein alpha or beta subunits. Isoprenylation of gamma subunits by the geranylgeranyl group is presumed to contribute to the association of G proteins with membranes.\r"

Cellular genes are also activated by E1A, one example being the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus when assayed by transfection into fibroblast cells. We have explored the basis for the E1A-dependent activation of this cellular transcription unit. We demonstrate that the ATTTGCAT (\"octamer\") element found in the heavy-chain enhancer and promoter is a target for E1A trans-activation since this sequence can confer inducibility to the normally unresponsive simian virus 40 early promoter. In addition, adenovirus infection stimulates the DNA-binding activity of the ubiquitous octamer-specific factor, OTF-1, and we presume that this is the basis for the stimulation of transcription. Although there are no octamer elements in the adenovirus genome that are known to be important for transcription, there are octamer elements in the viral terminal repeat sequences. These elements bind the NFIII factor and are important for the initiation of DNA replication. Since the NFIII factor has been shown to be identical to OTF-1, we suggest that the stimulation of OTF-1/NFIII activity during an adenovirus infection may be important for efficient initiation of adenovirus DNA synthesis.\r"

These mutant constructs have been transfected into homozygous Mov13 fibroblasts that do not express the endogenous Col1a1 gene due to a retroviral insertion. Secreted triple-helical type I collagens containing substitutions of Pro for Ile (position 776) (P1') were not cleaved by human rheumatoid synovial collagenase, whereas those containing substitutions of Met for Ile (position 776) were cleaved. Type I collagens containing double substitutions of Pro for Gln-774 (P2) and Ala-777 (P2') were not cleaved regardless of whether they contained the wild-type residue Ile at position 776 or the substitution of Met for Ile at position 776. The wild-type alpha 2(I) chains derived from the endogenous Col1a2 gene were also resistant to enzyme digestion when they were complexed with the mutant alpha 1(I) chains, indicating that the presence of normal alpha 1(I) sequences is critical for cleavage of the alpha 2(I) chains in the type I heterotrimer.\r"

We show here that frzE encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 83 kDa. FrzE is homologous to both CheA and CheY of Salmonella typhimurium, which are members of a family of \"two-component response regulators.\" It is thought that the modulator components autophosphorylate and transfer a phosphate group to their cognate effector components. FrzE contains an unusual (alanine plus proline)-rich region that might constitute a flexible hinge facilitating phosphate transfer between functional domains. We suggest that FrzE is a second messenger that relays information between the signaling protein FrzCD and the gliding motor.\r"

Photic regulation of Fos immunoreactivity does not occur in other retino-recipient brain areas except for the intergeniculate leaflet, which appears to be involved in mediating some of the complex effects of light on expressed circadian rhythms. Our results point to a promising new functional marker for the cellular effects of light and suggest that the expression of Fos or a related nuclear protein may be part of the mechanism for photic entrainment of the circadian clock to environmental light/dark cycles.\r"

Optimal yields of tox gene products are obtained only when iron becomes the growth-rate-limiting substrate. Previous studies suggest that regulation of tox expression is mediated through an iron-binding aporepressor. To facilitate molecular cloning of the tox regulatory element from genomic libraries of C. diphtheriae, we constructed a tox promoter/operator (toxPO)-lacZ transcriptional fusion in Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha. We report the molecular cloning and nucleic acid sequence of a diphtheria tox iron-dependent regulatory element, dtxR, and demonstrate that expression of beta-galactosidase from the toxPO-lacZ fusion is regulated by dtxR-encoded protein in an iron-sensitive manner. In addition, we show that expression of the toxPO-lacZ fusion is not affected by the E. coli iron-regulatory protein Fur and that the dtxR protein does not inhibit expression of fur-regulated outer-membrane proteins.\r"

A protein that stimulates the rate of exchange of guanine nucleotide on p21ras has been identified and characterized in cytoplasmic extracts of human placenta. The exchange-promoting protein runs on a gel filtration column with an apparent relative molecular weight of about 60,000. It is sensitive to heat and to trypsin. The exchange-promoting protein acts reversibly and does not cause degradation of p21ras. It is inactive towards the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (Go alpha) but acts on a large number of different mutant ras proteins, including transforming and effector mutants that are insensitive to the action of GAP. This protein, which we have termed REP (ras exchange-promoting), has the characteristics expected of a physiological activator of p21ras in cellular growth-signal-transduction pathways.\r"

Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, also led to decreased levels of mature beta APP and increased levels of the 15- and 19-kDa peptides. H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and of several other protein kinases, apparently decreased the rate of proteolytic processing of mature beta APP. The sizes of the putative COOH-terminal fragments observed after treatment with either phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or okadaic acid suggest that one or both may contain the entire beta/A4 region of beta APP and thus be amyloidogenic. Our results support the hypothesis that abnormal protein phosphorylation may play a role in the development of the cerebral amyloidosis that accompanies Alzheimer disease.\r"

Phage encoding nine different streptavidin-binding peptide sequences were isolated from this library. The core consensus sequence was His-Pro-Gln and binding of these phage to streptavidin was inhibited by biotin.

The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe.

In this study, mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced against a pathologic RBC autoantibody with anti-Pr2 specificity. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell clones were established from a patient who had splenic lymphoma and associated immune hemolysis due to an anti-Pr2 cold autoantibody. Two of the eight clones producing this autoantibody were used to immunize mice for the establishment of hybridomas, and four monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies were isolated (2 IgG1 kappa and 2 IgM kappa). By the use of these anti-idiotypic antibodies, strong crossreactivity was seen on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with other anti-Pr2-producing clones from the same patient, but no cross-reactivity was seen with RBC autoantibodies from other individuals having anti-Pr or different specificities. Each of the anti-idiotypic antibodies inhibited hemagglutination (HA) by the patient's anti-Pr2 but failed to inhibit HA by antisera of a different RBC specificity. Cross-competition experiments indicated that all of the anti-idiotypic antibodies may recognize the same or a closely related idiotope on the anti-Pr2 autoantibody. These studies suggested that the four anti-idiotypic antibodies are directed against the same (or closely related) idiotypic determinant(s), unique to this patient's anti-Pr2 and located at or near the antigen-binding site. These anti-idiotypic antibodies may be useful tools for the study of this autoimmune response or for the development of immune therapeutic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two hundred twenty units of regular insulin over a 5-hour period were required to reverse the lipolysis, acidemia, and abdominal pain, which characterized her severe episode of diabetic ketoacidosis. This discussion emphasizes the importance of insulin in the reversal of the hyperglycemia and acidosis that accompany a diabetic crisis. The roles of bicarbonate, phosphorous, magnesium, insulin, potassium, and fluids are discussed along with conditions such as pregnancy, infection, pancreatitis, and abdominal pain, which can complicate the management of diabetic ketoacidosis.\r"

We measured PGE2, PGI2, IL-1 beta, and TNF concentrations in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples (on admission, CSF1, and 18 to 30 hours later, CSF2) from 80 infants and children with bacterial meningitis. Forty patients received dexamethasone sodium (0.6 mg/kg per day in four intravenous doses) and 40 received an intravenous saline placebo. In CSF1, PGE2, PGI2, IL-1 beta, and TNF were detected in 90%, 56%, 98%, and 71% of specimens with mean (+/- SEM) concentrations of 462 +/- 65, 377 +/- 62, 1266 +/- 242, and 799 +/- 227 pg/mL, respectively. Concentrations of PGE2 correlated significantly with PGI2, IL-1 beta, TNF, and lactate and inversely correlated with glucose concentrations in the first CSF specimens. The PGE2, PGI2, IL-1 beta, and TNF were still detected in 40%, 18%, 97%, and 60%, respectively, of second CSF specimens obtained from placebo-treated patients. Compared with patients who had detectable PGI2 or TNF alpha concentrations in CSF2 specimens, those placebo-treated patients with no detectable PGI2 or TNF alpha activity in CSF2 had a lower incidence of neurological sequelae. Dexamethasone-treated patients had significantly lower PGE2, IL-1 beta, and lactate concentrations and higher glucose concentrations in CSF 18 to 30 hours later, shorter duration of fever, and a lower incidence of neurological sequelae than did placebo-treated patients.\r"

Since the two cell lines in the chimera share the same environment in vitro and in vivo on cell culture preceding chromosome analysis, differences in the expression of c-fra must be due to genetic factors. The peripheral lymphocytes were cultured in medium 199 and in medium RPMI 1640 with and without aphidicolin. All lesions were localized after GTG-banding and mapped to the human idiogram. In the cultures with aphidicolin the XX cells showed, at high (0.4 microM) APC levels, a significantly higher expression of c-fra than did the XY cells. This difference between cell lineages was not confined to certain individual c-fra; rather it was seen for practically all of them. Therefore, we conclude that there are genetic factors which influence the propensity of c-fra to be expressed. Whether sex is one of these factors, or perhaps even the most important one, still has to be elucidated.\r"

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the coding sequence of human dihydropteridine reductase from the messenger RNA of skin fibroblasts. Chemical cleavage of mismatches indicated a mismatched thymine and cytosine at approximately 117 and 147 bases, respectively, from the end of the probe. Cloning and sequencing of the mutant PCR products revealed the insertion of the triplet ACT (threonine), after alanine 122 (base 390). Amplification of a small region around this mutation by using genomic DNA as the PCR target indicates that the mutation is completely within an exon. Unequal crossing-over at the second base in the preceding alanine codon and duplication of the bases CTA may be the mechanism of mutagenesis. The cleavage site 147 bases from the end of the probe corresponded to the conversion of guanine to adenine at base 420 (CTG to CTA) and does not alter the code for leucine. This change, which was also seen in another dihydropteridine reductase-deficient child and in a control subject probably represents a common neutral polymorphism.\r"

Thyroid function values (T4, T3, rT3, TSH) were normal in all patients whereas baseline serum prolactin values were significantly increased in alcoholics as compared with a control group. In a combined TRH- and GnRH-stimulation tests, GH-responses were also normal whereas TSH and prolactin responses were blunted or absent in about half of the patients, the responses correlating significantly (p less than 0.01).

An additional control group was fed lab chow ad libitum. The treatment was implemented from day 7 to 17 of gestation, whereafter all groups were fed lab chow. Birth occurred on day 19, and the fatty acid composition of the brain membrane phospholipids was determined in the pups 3 days after birth (day 22 postconception) and again, 10 days later (day 32 postconception). On day 22 the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of the brain phospholipids reflected dietary availability, with the n-3/n-6 ratio higher in the n-3 groups; this was decreased by ethanol in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) fraction. The dietary effect was still apparent on day 32; again ethanol reduced this in both the PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) fractions. The n-3 oil, but not ethanol, increased the 20:3n-6/20:4n-6 ratio, indicative of an inhibition of the activity of delta-5 desaturase. With respect to the 22:C compounds, the n-3 oil decreased the levels of 22:5n-6, while increasing those of 22:6n-3, but generally the sum of these two fatty acids remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results obtained were compared with those of age-matched males transplanted within the same month by the same surgical teams for advanced hepatocellular disease other than alcoholism. Little change for any parameter assessed pre- and post-transplantation was noted for the nonalcoholics. In contrast, the FSH, LH, and testosterone levels of the alcoholic men all increased significantly following successful transplantation. These data suggest that the liver disease associated with alcoholism contributes to some of the endocrine effects of alcohol-associated cirrhosis but not all. Because the transplanted alcoholics remain less adequate than controls, it is further suggested that some residual alcohol-induced injury to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis persists despite successful liver transplantation.\r"

Comparison of postprandial breath 13CO2 enrichment allowed complete separation between children with pancreatic insufficiency and controls. Administration of one capsule of pancreatic enzyme with the test meal resulted in an increase in 13CO2 production in all six patients, and four capsules produced a further increase in five of the six. Serial fat balance studies on four of the patients while receiving comparable doses of oral enzyme failed to demonstrate a progressive improvement in fat absorption. The [13C]trioctanoin breath test may prove a safe, non-invasive technique not only for the detection of pancreatic insufficiency, but also for the quantitative study of intraluminal lipolysis.\r"

Because of the potential usefulness of multilumen catheters, we studied infection rates in a prospective, randomized trial. All patients requiring total parenteral nutrition were randomized to either single- or double-lumen catheters. Single-lumen catheters were used for dextrose-amino acids only. Medications or fat emulsions were given either by another central line or peripherally. Double-lumen catheters were used for dextrose-amino acid solutions, compatible medications, and fat emulsions. Catheters were cultured (48 single lumen and 53 double lumen) from 112 patients who successfully completed the study. No patients in either group developed catheter sepsis. We concluded that parenteral nutrition can be given as safely via double-lumen catheters as single-lumen catheters when strict protocols are established and followed.\r"

The term ossifying hemangioma is used to denote an intratemporal vascular tumor characterized by new bone formation, which is responsible for the typical honeycomb appearance of these tumors on high-resolution computed tomographic scans. Early resection offers the best chance for good facial recovery in patients with vascular tumors of the temporal bone involving the facial nerve. Our case report supports this observation and emphasizes the importance of incorporating these tumors in the differential diagnosis of patients with persistent facial paralysis.\r"

The psychomotor tests were of long and short term memory, critical flicker fusion threshold, attention and concentration, cognition, mental arithmetic, and sedation and anxiety levels, and were performed before operation and at 30 min, 60 min, 2 h and 24 h after operation. Free recall of a picture learning task was the most sensitive test, showing a significant impairment in all groups, persisting for more than 2 h. Propofol was associated with the most rapid recovery and least impairment compared with preoperative baseline. Performance improved in all the tests after antagonism with flumazenil, but was still significantly impaired compared with baseline in tests of picture recall and letter deletion. Significant decreases in performance in all tests were detected 1 h after flumazenil. No increase in anxiety was recorded after flumazenil. We conclude that infusion of propofol is the technique with the most rapid recovery, while only brief and incomplete antagonism of the effects of midazolam may be expected with flumazenil.\r"

Before administration of lignocaine, airway irritation elicited not only the cough reflex, but also other respiratory reflexes such as expiration, apnoea and spasmodic panting. Immediately after administration of i.v. lignocaine, when plasma concentrations of lignocaine exceeded 4.7 micrograms ml-1, tracheal irritation elicited only brief apnoea. Other reflex responses were suppressed completely; they recovered gradually with progressive decrease in plasma concentration of lignocaine. The apnoeic reflex was not eliminated at plasma lignocaine concentrations greater than 7.0 micrograms ml-1, whereas the expiration reflex, cough reflex and spasmodic panting were eliminated effectively by plasma concentrations of lignocaine greater than 3.5, 2.8 and 2.2 micrograms ml-1, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "We recently developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total protein S (PS) antigen using the monoclonal antibody S-12. During the screening of thrombophilic patients we identified a patient, who was using marcoumar, with 0% PS by monoclonal ELISA and 23% PS by polyclonal ELISA. Further analysis of this patient and his family showed that the patient was a compound heterozygote for type 1 PS deficiency and for an abnormal PS molecule (PS-Heerlen) that was not recognized by the S-12 antibody. Similar observations were made in two sisters from an unrelated Dutch family. Subsequent studies showed that PS Heerlen has a slightly lower molecular weight (71,000) than normal PS (73,000), binds normally to C4b-binding protein, and retains full activated protein C cofactor activity. The alteration in the PS Heerlen molecule was identified as a substitution of Ser460 by Pro, which is due to a unique T---C transition in exon 13 of the active PS-alpha gene. The substitution occurs in the consensus sequence for the potential N-linked glycosylation of Asn458. Digestion with N-glycanase showed that normal PS probably contains three N-linked oligosaccharide side chains, while PS Heerlen contains only two (Asn458 not glycosylated?). Segregation analysis in the two original families showed that the presence of the genetic abnormality was always associated with the PS-Heerlen phenotype. The frequency of the PS-Heerlen allele was found to be 0.52% in the general population and 0.67% in a population of patients with unexplained thrombophilia. There is no evidence that the PS Heerlen allele is associated with an increased risk for thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "Generation and inhibition of activated factor IXa was studied in factor XIa-activated plasma containing 4 mmol/L free calcium ions and 20 mumol/L phospholipid (25 mol% phosphatidylserine/75 mol% phosphatidylcholine). Interference of other (activated) clotting factors with the factor IXa activity measurements could be avoided by using a highly specific and sensitive bioassay. Factor IXa generation curves were analyzed according to a model that assumed Michaelis-Menten kinetics of factor XIa-catalyzed factor IXa formation and pseudo first order kinetics of inhibition of factor XIa and factor IXa. In the absence of heparin, factor IXa activity in plasma reached final levels that were found to increase with increasing amounts of factor XIa used to activate the plasma. When the model was fitted to this set of factor IXa generation curves, the analysis yielded a rate constant of inhibition of factor XIa of 0.7 +/- 0.1 min-1 and a kcat/Km ratio of 0.29 +/- 0.01 (nmol/L)-1 min-1. No neutralization of factor IXa activity was observed (the estimated rate constant of inhibition of factor IXa was 0). Thus, in the absence of heparin, the final level of factor IXa in plasma is only dependent on the initial factor XIa concentration. While neutralization of in situ generated factor IXa in normal plasma was negligible, unfractionated heparin dramatically enhanced the rate of inactivation of factor IXa (apparent second order rate constant of inhibition of 5.2 min-1/per microgram heparin/mL). The synthetic pentasaccharide heparin, the smallest heparin chain capable of binding antithrombin III, stimulated the inhibition of in situ generated factor IXa, but sevenfold less than unfractionated heparin (k = 0.76 min-1 per microgram pentasaccharide/mL). We found that free calcium ions were absolutely required to observe an unfractionated heparin and pentasaccharide-stimulated neutralization of factor IXa activity. Factor XIa inhibition (psuedo first order rate constant of 0.7 min-1) was not affected by unfractionated heparin or pentasaccharide in the range of heparin concentrations studied.\r"

Indirect support for a sequestration of T cells in the spleen and tumor-involved lymphoid tissue has accumulated. To test the hypothesis that the blood CD4 T-lymphocytopenia in patients with HD is caused by an altered lymphocyte traffic, 12 untreated HD patients and five in complete clinical remission (CCR) were studied. Blood lymphocytes were collected by leukapheresis and gradient centrifugation, and were further purified by an adherence step. The cells were labeled with indium-111 oxine and reinfused intravenously into the patient. The radioactivity of CD4+ and CD8+ blood lymphocytes separated by immunoabsorption was measured from serial blood samples. CD4+ cells were eliminated more rapidly in untreated patients than patients in CCR. Repeated gamma camera imaging after autotransfusion of indium-111 oxine labeled cells demonstrated an accumulation of radioactivity in tumor-involved tissue of untreated patients. These findings support the concept of an enhanced elimination of CD4+ cells in patients with active HD that may contribute to the observed blood T-lymphocytopenia and may reflect a biologic response to the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To develop and evaluate a record of shared care to be held by the patient designed to increase the effectiveness of long term care of patients with severe mental illness. DESIGN--Questionnaires completed by medical staff, community psychiatric nurse, and patients to evaluate the shared care record. SETTING--General practices, a psychiatric outpatient clinic, and a mental health resource centre in south east London. PATIENTS--84 Patients held shared care records over an 18 month period. They were selected by general practitioners, a psychiatrist, or a community psychiatric nurse, the criterion being that their care was shared between the general practitioner and the psychiatrist or community psychiatric nurse. Patients who had been admitted to hospital several times with short remissions were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their views on the acceptability, usefulness, and problems of the shared care record. A questionnaire for health staff was designed to identify patients for whom the shared care record was most and least appropriate. It also assessed the patients' compliance and the way the record affected communication between all concerned. RESULTS--Patients found the shared care records very acceptable and were enthusiastic about their use. They valued being consulted about what was recorded and found the record of their treatment and progress useful. Patients also thought that they were in a better position to challenge their doctor. Those least likely to comply were people with severe paranoia. The acceptability of the record to patients greatly exceeded that to the psychiatrists and nurse managers, none of whom were interested in using the record. Communication among health staff was greatly improved by the shared care record, and it facilitated the identification of potentially dangerous drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS--Shared care records were acceptable to patients with severe mental illnesses, increased the patients' autonomy, and improved communication and the effectiveness of shared care. Obstacles to further development of this approach relate to the attitudes, perceptions, and anxieties of the doctors, nurses, and managers and can be overcome.\r"

Todd's autohistographic method, modified by Lotti, was used to investigate the FA and the monoclonal antibodies against u-PA and t-PA were used to identify the main plasminogen activator. Our results show that the FA is increased in the synovial membrane of patients with OA in comparison with the synovial FA of control subjects. In the synovial membranes from patients with RA, the FA shows different results: in some specimens FA is increased, and in others it is diminished or similar, compared with FA of samples from healthy controls. Thus, our data on synovial FA in OA confirm the previous reports, performed in vitro, on the activation of the plasmin system in this degenerative disease. The activity of the fibrinolytic system seems to participate in the cartilage degeneration and, via the activation of collagenase, to perpetuate the cartilage damage.\r"

Most important among these are the presence and extent of ischemia, anatomic considerations, and the functional status of the myocardium subserved by the vessel. In patients with functionally and hemodynamically insignificant disease with no ischemia, it is appropriate simply to follow the patient and to modify the risk factors for atherosclerosis if they exist. All three of the currently available modalities are appropriate in individual patients, including medical management, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, and surgical revascularization. In ambiguous cases, the available studies suggest no benefit from aggressive strategies; therefore, a conservative approach that minimizes side effects and complications of treatment is best.\r"

All hips received 1500 rads. Eight of these hips were irradiated after excising severe heterotopic bone, five because they developed extensive heterotopic ossification in the opposite hip, and five others because they were considered to be at high risk for developing heterotopic ossification. Only two of the 18 hips developed a small amount of heterotopic bone after localized periarticular radiation. All wounds healed primarily. No progressive radiolucencies developed at the bone-prosthesis interface. There was only one trochanteric nonunion of six trochanteric osteotomies. Localized periarticular radiation therapy with precision shielding of the prosthetic components and adjacent skeletal structures is an effective means to prevent heterotopic bone formation around cementless total hip arthroplasties. It also has the advantage of not adversely affecting the healing of the trochanteric osteotomy.\r"

  ".W": "Unfortunately, the majority of studies proposed to evaluate a physician's capabilities, such as effectiveness programs, outcome research, and hospital evaluation, do not focus directly on the individual practitioner. The certifying process, although imperfect, still offers the best method of evaluation. The other evaluation methods will need additional refinement to be able to individually analyze a specific physician's performance and determine whether he or she is truly providing the highest quality care. Physicians are being asked to document the effectiveness of their clinical decision making. On the surface this seems so simple, and in some areas where the outcome is either life or death or a specific yes or no type of answer, many have the capability to come forth with some realistic documentation. However, today's society is focused on health and the perfect outcome, and many nonlife-threatening therapies are evaluated by a patient's unrealistic expectation. Thus, the same result may be interpreted differently in one geographic area or by patients with different expectations. The biggest mistake would be to believe that outcome studies can be used to reduce cost. There may be some initial reduction or delays in treatment that suggest an immediate reduction of cost, the so-called sentinel effect, but no information or evidence indicates that these effects can be expanded without actually reducing needed health care services. In fact, the delays or obstruction to entering the health-care system experienced by many individuals often lead to more costly and less effective care with suboptimal results.\r"

Because elimination of cyclosporine depends on its metabolism in the liver by an enzyme (cytochrome P-450IIIA) that also demethylates erythromycin, we reasoned that the ability of patients to demethylate a test dose of erythromycin might be useful in estimating their appropriate daily doses of cyclosporine. Accordingly, the [14C-N-methyl] erythromycin breath test was administered to 32 patients before they received 3.0, 5.0, or 7.5 mg/kg/day cyclosporine to treat psoriasis. We found that a simple mathematical equation incorporating just the 14CO2 production, the age of the patient, and the daily dose of cyclosporine accounted for almost 80% (R2 = 0.78) of the interpatient variability in cyclosporine blood levels we observed. Our data indicate that P-450IIIA activity largely accounts for the relationship between dose of cyclosporine and blood levels for an individual patient. We conclude that the erythromycin breath test may be a convenient guide for cyclosporine dosing.\r"

Therefore hemodynamic effects after two infusion rates (0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/min) of atrial natriuretic factor (99-126) were investigated in young (n = 8) and elderly (n = 9) volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled protocol. After low-rate infusion, ANF concentrations increased to the upper normal range, and only minor effects were observed. In contrast, high-rate infusion resulted in a decrease in blood pressure and forearm vascular resistance, whereas an increase in heart rate was observed in both groups. Between young and elderly subjects, a significant difference was observed in the ANF-induced decrease in systolic blood pressure (mean +/- SD, -4% +/- 4% versus -12% +/- 7%, p less than 0.05) and mean arterial pressure (-6% +/- 5% versus -11% +/- 4%, p less than 0.05) during the high rate infusion. When compared with the concentrations of the young subjects, the ANF concentrations reached at both ANF dosages were higher in the elderly subjects; this was the result of a diminished ANF clearance in the elderly subjects. After correction of the changes of systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure for the higher ANF levels reached within this elderly group, no difference between young and elderly subjects remained. We conclude that a diminished cardiovascular responsiveness to ANF with advancing age could not be demonstrated. In contrast, the high-rate infusion of ANF induced an increased hemodynamic response in the elderly subjects, but this seems to be the result of the higher ANF levels reached within this group.\r"

After 4 weeks, pravastatin monotherapy (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg twice daily) significantly decreased total cholesterol by 17% to 24% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 23% to 35% (p less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% to 9%, and triglycerides decreased by 6% to 9%. The area under the serum concentration-time curve and maximum serum concentration of pravastatin showed dose-proportionality; time to maximum serum concentration and serum elimination half-life were independent of dose. When added to pravastatin therapy, cholestyramine enhanced the lipid-lowering effects of pravastatin. After 4 weeks of combination therapy, total cholesterol was reduced by 32% to 38% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 47% to 56% (p less than 0.001).

Mean weight fell significantly (122.8 +/- 21.4 vs 102.2 +/- 22.8 kg, P less than 0.0001) and functional residual capacity rose slightly but significantly (1.94 +/- 0.58 vs 2.18 +/- 0.64 litres; P less than 0.05) after weight loss. 3. The hypercapnic ventilatory response slope fell significantly after weight loss (2.88 +/- 2.27 vs 2.24 +/- 1.06 litres min-1 mmHg-1, P less than 0.05) with a significant shift of the ventilatory response curve to the right. There were no statistically significant changes in the patterns of ventilatory response. 4. In addition, isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response slopes, measured at two levels of carbon dioxide partial pressure, fell significantly after weight loss. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts of the ventilatory response curves to the left, such that, for a given oxygen saturation, mean ventilation was significantly lower in the less obese state. Similarly to hypercapnic responses, there were no statistically significant changes in ventilatory pattern despite the changes in overall ventilatory response. 5. We conclude that ventilatory responsiveness to chemical stimuli is increased in obese subjects who maintain adequate alveolar ventilation while awake.\r"

Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and several other hormones were measured and related to the renal responses to chronic changes in the dietary intake of protein and sodium, alone and in combination. Eight healthy subjects consumed four diets for 1 week: a basal diet containing 140 mmol of sodium/day and 1 g of protein day-1 kg-1, the same diet with isocaloric addition of 1 g of meat protein day-1 kg-1, the basal diet with addition of 170 mmol of sodium chloride/day and the basal diet with both additions. 2. Creatinine clearance was increased significantly both by protein and, to a smaller extent, by sodium. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and the urinary excretion of guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate were increased significantly by sodium but were not affected by protein. Protein induced a significant rise in plasma glucagon levels, whereas the rise in somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor I) just failed to reach statistical significance. 3. These findings demonstrate that atrial natriuretic peptide does not mediate chronic protein-induced hyperfiltration, although it may contribute to the renal effects of sodium. Glucagon and somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor I) may have contributed to chronic protein-induced hyperfiltration.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms leading to enhanced synthesis and release of atrial natriuretic factor during chronic hypoxia, we measured immunoreactive plasma atrial natriuretic factor, blood gases, packed cell volume, pulmonary artery pressure and systemic artery pressure in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 1, 2 or 3 weeks of normobaric hypoxia. Rats were implanted with pulmonary and carotid artery catheters and studied conscious, 23 h after return to hypoxia. 2. The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor messenger RNA was measured in the right and left ventricular free walls of rats exposed to 3 weeks of hypoxia and in normoxic control rats. 3. There was a trend for plasma atrial natriuretic factor to increase with the duration of exposure to hypoxia but only the 3-week hypoxic rats had a significantly higher level (1080 +/- 193 pg/ml) than the normoxic control rats (318 +/- 46 pg/ml, P less than 0.05, mean +/- SEM).

The importance of increased aldosterone secretion during the early phase (within 48 h) of this response is unclear. Using two indirect measures of aldosterone secretion (in urine and saliva), we have tried to relate changes in excretion and concentration of this hormone to renal sodium excretion during the abrupt transition from a normal (approximately 150 mmol/day) or high (260 mmol/day) to a low (5-25 mmol/day) sodium intake in 11 and seven male volunteers, respectively. 2. All subjects showed reduced renal sodium excretion within 36 h of dietary restriction, but the times at which increases in renal aldosterone excretion, saliva aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity became statistically significant varied widely (8-72 h, 2.5- greater than 62.5 h and less than 4- greater than 38 h for renal aldosterone secretion, saliva aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity, respectively). Circadian fluctuations in saliva aldosterone concentration were apparent and increased in amplitude during sodium restriction. 3. Urine flow rate tended to increase on the first day of sodium restriction and this reached statistical significance in the group initially on a high sodium intake (64.0 +/- 8.8 to 84.3 +/- 11.2 ml/h, P less than 0.01); although the pattern of urine flow did correlate with plasma arginine vasopressin concentration (r = -0.49, P less than 0.01), there was no significant decrease in mean plasma arginine vasopressin concentration [1.15 (0.92-1.44) to 0.90 (0.72-1.12) pmol/l, P = 0.08; geometric mean and 95% confidence limits].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) with PEEP on the release of alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was investigated in both humans and an experimental model. In the human study, systemic artery blood samples from 22 critically ill patients were analyzed for ANP. Seventeen of these patients received PPV with different levels of PEEP (5 to 15 cm H2O). The remaining five patients were breathing spontaneously (0 PEEP). There was no significant difference in plasma levels of ANP obtained at different levels of PEEP, and no correlation between ANP vs. wedge pressure or CVP was found. For the experimental group, in six dogs a PEEP dose-response curve was established (PEEP 0, 5, 10, 15, 0 cm H2O every 45 min). Blood samples from pulmonary and systemic arteries were obtained for ANP determination, and urine and Na excretion were measured at the end of each period. Neither significant interaction between PEEP and ANP was observed, nor did levels of this peptide correlate with the decrease in cardiac output (p less than .05) and urine output (p less than .05), or with the increase in CVP (p less than .05) observed during PEEP. ANP concentrations in the pulmonary and systemic arteries were similar. In 14 human samples, ANP was determined by radioimmunoassay and radioreceptor assay systems, but the level obtained by both methods did not significantly correlate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Critically ill patients who require multiple infusions of vasoactive and inotropic medications would benefit if physicians had additional information regarding compatibility of nitroprusside with other commonly used infusions. Utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography, the authors investigated the physical and chemical compatibility of nitroprusside, dobutamine, and nitroglycerin in solutions of 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl at clinically relevant concentrations. All drugs were present within the guidelines of the U.S. Pharmacopeia (+/- 10%) over 24 h in NaCl, but nitroglycerin degraded over 24 h when the three drugs were mixed in dextrose. We recommend diluting these medicines in NaCl when mixtures of them would exist for greater than 4 h.\r"

A total of 27 cycles analyzed were unstimulated, 19 were stimulated by clomiphene citrate (CC), and 7 with CC, human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Compared with reference profiles of salivary P from 27 normal cycles, the length and magnitude of P secretion were significantly lower in the infertility group. Luteal P concentrations were normalized during CC stimulation and significantly elevated during the CC-hMG-hCG stimulation. The other abnormalities found in the salivary P profiles of these patients included preovulatory P peaks, interruption of P secretion during luteal phase, and high P level at the beginning of menstruation. The results suggest that patients with prolonged unexplained infertility represent a heterogenous population with common luteal phase defects. The disturbance is effectively corrected with treatments stimulating gonadotropin secretion.\r"

The records of 81 patients who had undergone three or more IVF attempts during a 2-year period were studied to determine the degree and potential impact of intercycle variability in basal FSH concentrations. The mean of the individual standard deviations for all 81 patients was 4.2 +/- 0.4 mIU/mL. However, the patients with a mean basal FSH of less than 15 mIU/mL had a mean deviation of only 2.6 +/- 0.2 mIU/mL, whereas those with a mean basal FSH of greater than or equal to 15 mIU/mL had a mean deviation of 7.3 +/- 0.7 mIU/mL. Intercycle variability in basal FSH values did not predict changes in ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and thus may not be used to select an optimal cycle in which to stimulate an individual patient. Furthermore, patients with large intercycle variation responded poorly to gonadotropin stimulation independent of their basal FSH concentration. This information allows more precise counseling of patients regarding their appropriateness for assisted reproduction.\r"

Follicular fluid immunoreactive EGF levels in the non-LA cycles correlated with androstenedione but not estradiol or progesterone levels from follicles with prophase I oocytes or from all follicles taken together, but not from metaphase I or metaphase II oocyte containing follicles alone. In non-LA cycles, FF immunoreactive EGF levels were lower in follicles that contained metaphase I or II oocytes than prophase I oocytes. Additionally, FF immunoreactive EGF levels were lower in follicles containing metaphase I or II oocytes from non-LA than LA cycles. We conclude that immunoreactive EGF is present in FF.

In patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, diverticular disease, and in controls (of tissue taken from patients with carcinoma, from a site distant from the tumor that appeared macroscopically normal), the concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and substance P have been measured by immunoassay in the following preparations of sigmoid colon: mucosa, whole colonic wall with mucosa dissected away, circular muscle, and taenia coli. In idiopathic constipation, the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide content of the whole wall minus mucosa was reduced when compared with controls (P less than 0.05) but was unaltered in the mucosa, circular muscle, and taenia coli. In diverticular disease, the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide content of the mucosa and whole wall minus the mucosal layer was increased when compared with control tissue (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02, respectively) but was unaltered in the circular muscle and taenia coli. Substance P and neuropeptide Y levels in all layers of colonic wall were unaltered in these two diseases. The disturbances in the normal neural content of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the bowel wall in idiopathic constipation and diverticular disease may initiate or contribute to the functional changes seen in these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "A primary culture of human antral somatostatin cells has been developed and used in release studies. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate, caused a concentration-dependent increase in immunoreactive somatostatin secretion with a 1-mumol/L concentration resulting in a 40-fold stimulation (basal 0.28% +/- 0.7% total cell content vs. 13.8% +/- 2.2% TCC, P less than 0.005). The calcium ionophore, A23187, resulted in a significant stimulation only at 1 mumol/L (basal 0.28% +/- 0.7% TCC vs. 2.2% +/- 0.5% total cell content, P less than 0.05). However, addition of the ionophore at 1 mumol/L with the phorbol ester resulted in a potentiation of the response at all concentrations tested. Removal of extracellular calcium by chelation with EGTA reduced the response to that seen with the phorbol ester alone. Forskolin at 0.1 mmol/L resulted in a five-fold increase (basal 0.6% +/- 0.2% total cell content vs. 2.8% +/- 0.9% total cell content, P less than 0.02) and was 1000-fold less potent than the phorbol ester. The peptides bombesin and gastrin at concentrations up to 1 mumol/L had no effect on basal secretion. Cholecystokinin-8 significantly stimulated somatostatin secretion with a maximal effect at 0.1 mumol/L resulting in an eightfold increase (basal 0.2% +/- 0.04% total cell content vs. 1.5% +/- 0.4% total cell content, P less than 0.02). These results indicate that human antral D cells are more responsive to agents acting through the c-kinase pathway (phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate, A23187, and cholecystokinin) than adenylate cyclase (forskolin).\r"

  ".U": "90337146\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous study we found that 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 protects the small intestine against chenodeoxycholic acid injury in the rat. One possible explanation for prostaglandin's protective action may be that prostaglandin-induced villus contraction accelerates mucosal restitution. This hypothesis was tested in rats by perfusing intestinal segments in vivo in a single-pass fashion with 0.125-0.5 micrograms/L of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. These studies showed a dose-dependent, reversible contraction of intestinal villi and crypts. To test the effect of this contraction on mucosal restitution, standardized intestinal injury was produced in indomethacin-pretreated rats perfused in vivo with 5 mmol/L chenodeoxycholic acid. The rats were then perfused with bile acid-free buffer containing either 0.5 microgram/mL of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 or vehicle. This study showed that despite decreasing villus height after bile acid injury, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 did not significantly affect the rate of morphologic (assessed by villus denudation) or functional (assessed by mannitol and water absorption) restitution of the injured intestinal mucosa. Thus, although 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 causes villus contraction, this effect does not result in more rapid restitution of the injured intestinal mucosa and is not a likely mechanism for prostaglandin-mediated protection of the intestinal mucosa.\r"

Total body protein, plasma proteins, respiratory muscle function, and skeletal muscle function were measured at the commencement of a 14-day course of IV nutrition and 7 and 14 days later. Final measurements were made after recovery approximately 200 days later. Compared with a group of matched controls, the patients had lost approximately 35% of their body protein stores with accompanying physiological impairments of 20%-40%. After 4 days of IV nutrition, there were improvements in all the physiological measurements (approximately 12%) but no significant change in total body protein. During convalescence, there were further improvements in physiological function, which were accompanied by an increase in body stores of protein. We conclude that there is an early and rapid improvement in physiological function with IV nutrition in patients hospitalised for exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease even though this is not accompanied by significant protein gain. Later during anabolic recovery, physiological improvements occur in association with repletion of total body protein. Short courses of IV nutrition in these patients prevent protein loss and result in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and respiratory muscle function.\r"

Their interrelationships were examined in 17 men with alcoholic liver disease, 7 with and 10 without ascites. Atrial size was determined by two-dimensional echocardiography. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly increased left atrial volume and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor when compared with normal male subjects. Right atrial volume was normal in patients with cirrhosis, as was left ventricular function. Patients with ascites had significantly increased blood volume and plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration compared with patients without ascites. Left and right atrial volume did not differ between the groups. Blood volume correlated significantly with left atrial volume, which correlated significantly with plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor. Cirrhosis is associated with related increases in vascular volume, left atrial size, and plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration. Increased blood volume probably contributes to the increase in left atrial volume, which is in turn one reason for the elevation of plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration.\r"

Therefore, we developed a simplified method for detecting hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. The main advantages of this method are that it can be performed rapidly, consists of only several steps, and has a false positive rate of less than 0.1% in our laboratory. In testing serial samples from five chimpanzees experimentally infected with hepatitis B virus, we found that hepatitis B virus DNA was detected 2-3 weeks before the appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen, and it continued to be detectable 1-3 weeks after the production of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. In testing serum from 84 human patients, we found hepatitis B virus DNA in all patients who had hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen in serum and in 64% of the patients with hepatitis B surface antigen with antibody to hepatitis B e antigen in serum. Also, 3 out of 11 patients who were chronic hepatitis B carriers and who subsequently lost hepatitis B surface antigen were found to test positive for hepatitis B virus in serum. In contrast, all patients who lost hepatitis B surface antigen after acute hepatitis B virus infection or those classified as having non-A, non-B hepatitis tested negative for hepatitis B virus DNA. Thus, the modified PCR technique is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting hepatitis B virus DNA-containing virions in serum.\r"

Subjects included both blacks and whites, as well as men and women. The fluorescent dye 2'7-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein was used to monitor the cytosolic pH in these cells. Platelets from black (hypertensive and normotensive) men and hypertensive white men demonstrated a highly significant alkaline shift in the apparent cytosolic pH set point for activation of the Na-H antiport. For the hypertensive subgroups, the cytosolic pH set point values (mean +/- SEM) were: white men, 7.45 +/- 0.052; white women, 7.04 +/- 0.089; black men, 7.66 +/- 0.148; and black women, 7.20 +/- 0.082. For the normotensive subgroups, the cytosolic pH set point values were: white men, 7.13 +/- 0.034; white women, 7.05 +/- 0.036; black men, 7.50 +/- 0.110; and black women, 7.20 +/- 0.176 (p = 0.0016 for race and p = 0.0001 for gender, using a three-way analysis of variance by race, gender, and hypertension). There were no race-, gender-, or blood pressure-related differences among the various cohorts in the kinetics of sodium activation of the Na-H antiport, the cellular buffering power, and basal pH. These results suggest that at basal pH the Na-H antiport is quiescent in platelets from both black and white women and normotensive white men.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90338293\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken in 606 healthy women during pregnancy to evaluate the changes occurring in maternal thyroid economy as a result of 1) the increased thyroid hormone-binding capacity of serum, 2) the effects of increased levels of hCG on TSH and on the thyroid, and 3) a marginally low iodine intake in the population (50-75 micrograms/day). Four main features were observed. First, thyroidal activity adjusted to the marked increase in serum T4-binding globulin: pregnancy was accompanied by an overall reduction in the T4/T4-binding globulin ratio, with lower free T4 and T3 levels, although in most cases free hormone levels remained within the normal range. The adjustment of thyroidal output of T4 and T3 did not occur similarly in all subjects. In approximately one third of the women, there was relative hypothyroxinemia, higher T3/T4 ratios (presumably indicating preferential T3 secretion), and higher, although normal, serum TSH concentrations. Second, high hCG levels were associated with thyroid stimulation, both functionally (lower serum TSH) and anatomically (increased thyroid size). The data are consistent with a TSH-like effect of hCG on the thyroid. Hence, regulation of the maternal thyroid is complex, resulting from both elevated hCG (mainly in the first half of gestation) and increasing TSH (mainly in the second half of gestation). Third, a significant increase in serum thyroglobulin levels was observed throughout gestation, especially during the last trimester. Fourth, increased thyroid volume was common, and goiter formation not uncommon (goiter was found in 9% of women at delivery). In conclusion, the alterations in maternal thyroid function during gestation are intricate and far from fully understood. In areas of marginally low iodine intake, gestation is associated in a significant number of women with relative hypothyroxinemia, increased thyroglobulin, and enlarged thyroid.\r"

  ".U": "90338294\r", 
  ".W": "The deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase (17-KSR) was recently discovered to be a possible cause of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) in hirsute women. Forty three patients with PCOD (age range, 18-38 yr) were reevaluated to search for a hormonal pattern that might suggest an ovarian 17-KSR deficiency. Androstenedione, testosterone, FSH, LH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were evaluated basally on the day 17 of the menstrual cycle, when present, and after dynamic tests (ACTH stimulation, 1 mg im for 2 consecutive days; dexamethasone inhibition, 0.5 mg four times a day for 14 days; and cyproterone acetate treatment, 50 mg each day for 14 days) in three successive menstrual cycles or at 30-day intervals. All patients studied presented with hyperestronemia, abnormal gonadotropin pattern, and hyperandrogenism, but showed different responses of androstenedione and testosterone to dynamic tests. In two patients the hormonal pattern suggested an ovarian 17-KSR deficiency: in fact they showed plasma values of androstenedione (22 and 31.3 nmol/L, respectively) and estrone (628 and 849 pmol/L, respectively) that were greatly increased compared with other patients and with controls. Androstenedione did not increase after ACTH stimulation (21.5 and 32.1 nmol/L, respectively) and did not decrease after dexamethasone inhibition (21 and 29 nmol/L, respectively), but only decreased after cyproterone acetate treatment (8 and 10.8 nmol/L, respectively). An hCG test, performed during dexamethasone suppression, confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian 17-KSR defect in one of these two patients (patient 1). Two of three brothers of patient 1 (aged 25 and 34 yr) presented with persistent important pubertal gynecomastia; one brother also had severe oligospermia. These clinical findings and the high values of androstenedione/testosterone (0.85) and estrone/estradiol (4.1) ratios of baseline plasma levels compared with controls (0.18 and 2.1, respectively) suggested a partial testicular 17-KSR deficiency. Five other patients showed PCOD secondary to nonclassic 21-hydroxylase defect diagnosed on the basis of high 17-hydroxyprogesterone plasma values and highly responsive to ACTH. The remaining 36 patients showed increased values of androstenedione and testosterone after ACTH stimulation and a decrease of these two parameters after both dexamethasone inhibition and cyproterone acetate treatment. The discovery of the 17-KSR deficiency in men and women in the same family demonstrates genetic control of this enzyme similar in both sexes, confirming the hypothesis that this disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive character. Finally, it is strongly supported that ovarian 17-KSR defect may cause a syndrome closely resembling PCOD.\r"

The diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was confirmed by elevated urinary 5 beta/5 alpha-steroid metabolite ratios and demonstration of defective 5 alpha-reductase activity in cultured fibroblasts from the patient's scrotum and foreskin. Application of DHT cream to the patient's abdomen raised circulating levels of DHT to the adult male range. Two courses of DHT given nightly for 3 and 4 months resulted in phallic enlargement. Surgical release of the chordee and hypospadias repair have resulted in normal male appearance of the genitalia. This case illustrates the heterogeneity of the 5 alpha-reductase deficiency phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Hypopituitarism is a major manifestation of pituitary adenoma apoplexy. We postulated that the acute deterioration in pituitary function may be caused by compression of portal vessels and the pituitary stalk, secondary to a sudden increase in intrasellar contents. If this were the case, one would predict improvement in pituitary function to occur after surgical decompression. We studied pituitary function in eight patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of pituitary adenoma apoplexy before and on multiple occasions after urgent surgical decompression. Partial or complete hypopituitarism was seen in all subjects at the time of presentation. Serum cortisol levels were inappropriately low (5.9 +/- 1.4 micrograms/dL; 162.8 +/- 38 nmol/L) for the degree of stress in seven patients and appropriately elevated in only one subject (55.3 micrograms/dL; 1525.7 nmol/L). High normal increments in cortisol levels were noted in three subjects given test doses of cosyntropin. Patients were given glucocorticoids before, during, and for 2 days after surgery. Serum cortisol concentrations measured on or after the third day when glucocorticoids had already been stopped were normal in seven subjects and consistently low in one. These seven subjects were discharged on no replacement and were subsequently documented by dynamic testing to have normal pituitary-adrenal function. Gonadal function improved in two of four men and in one of two women who had hypogonadism on presentation. Improvement in thyroid function was documented in two of three subjects with preoperative hypothyroidism. Gradual improvement and almost complete resolution of the neuroophthalmological abnormalities occurred days to weeks after decompression. These observations demonstrate that urgent surgical decompression after pituitary tumor apoplexy was associated with improvement not only in neurological defects but also in pituitary function. The rapid improvement in pituitary function indicates not only that the hypopituitarism was reversible, but also that it might be caused by compression of the portal circulation and pituitary stalk by the sudden increase in intrasellar contents.\r"

Androstenedione, total and free testosterone, 5 alpha dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone levels progressively dropped during treatment while 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone, estradiol, ACTH, cortisol, LH and FSH levels increased. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased only towards the end of treatment, while estrone, sex hormone binding globulin, and PRL remained unchanged. Daily mean +/- SD rate of hair growth, measured by a special image analysis processor, decreased within 3 months of therapy from 0.258 +/- 0.058 to 0.184 +/- 0.039 mm/day (P less than 0.02) and mean +/- SD hair diameter from 0.123 +/- 0.015 to 0.110 +/- 0.013 mm (P less than 0.05) together with decreasing hormone levels. The therapeutic effects of ketoconazole on hirsutism was evident at 6 months in only 14 subjects, while no significant change in hirsutism score was recorded in 22 women who failed to complete the therapy. Acne improved in all cases. Several side effects and complications arose during treatment, such as headache, nausea, loss of scalp hair, hepatitis, and biochemical changes. Even though ketoconazole improves hyperandrogenism, only selected patients are eligible for treatment as scrupulous monitoring is required.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin-A (CgA), as measured in the circulation by RIA, has emerged as a useful probe of exocytotic sympathoadrenal activity in man as well as of the presence and extent of neuroendocrine neoplasia. Here we studied, using a sensitive RIA, the distribution of CgA immunoreactivity in normal human neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, to investigate whether these normal tissue sources measurably contribute to plasma CgA, we measured plasma CgA, catecholamine, and other polypeptide hormone responses to selective stimuli of secretion at several sites within the neuroendocrine system. Immunoreactive CgA was ubiquitous in human neuroendocrine tissues, in rank order of concentration (micrograms per g wet wt): adrenal medulla greater than pituitary greater than pancreas greater than stomach greater than small intestine (jejunoileum) greater than brain (frontal cortex) greater than parathyroid greater than thyroid. Quantitatively, neuroendocrine tissues other than the adrenal medulla possessed only 0.04-25% of the immunoreactivity found in the adrenal medulla. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia, a potent stimulus of adrenomedullary secretion, resulted in 1.7- and 14-fold rises in plasma CgA and epinephrine, respectively. However, insulin-induced hypoglycemia failed to perturb plasma CgA in three bilaterally adrenalectomized patients, suggesting that the adrenal medulla is the source of plasma CgA elevation during hypoglycemia in normal subjects. Cell type-selective secretagogue stimulation of normal endocrine secretory cells other than the adrenal medulla (pituitary, pancreas, gut, thyroid, and parathyroid) induced measurable increments in the concentrations of the resident peptide hormones, but left plasma CgA unperturbed. Nonselective stimulation of a wide variety of endocrine secretory cells with pentagastrin elevated plasma CgA 1.4-fold. However, restriction of pentagastrin's targets by coinfusion of calcium abolished the effect on plasma CgA. Hence, within the normal human neuroendocrine system, only selective stimulation of the adrenal medulla is likely to elevate plasma CgA under physiological or pharmacological circumstances. This is consistent with our finding of the adrenal medulla as the quantitatively major normal neuroendocrine tissue source of CgA immunoreactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Under physiological conditions, TSH, LH, FSH, and alpha-subunit are released in discrete pulses. To further characterize their neuroregulation and to investigate possible copulsatile secretion of these glycoprotein hormones, we studied the 24-h pulse profiles of all four hormones in each of four subject groups: young men, young women, postmenopausal women, and subjects with untreated primary hypothyroidism. Gonadotropin pulse properties in euthyroid men and women were similar to those previously reported, and hypothyroid subjects had normal gonadotropin pulse patterns. TSH release was pulsatile in all groups; hypothyroid subjects had increased pulse amplitude, but loss of the usual nocturnal increases in pulse amplitude. alpha-Subunit concentrations were pulsatile in all groups, with minimal circadian variation; postmenopausal and hypothyroid subjects had increased alpha-subunit pulse amplitude. We then tested pulse concordance among the four simultaneous hormone series. alpha-Subunit and the gonadotropins were significantly coreleased (triple coincidence), suggesting that all three hormones are closely linked to processes that regulate GnRH secretion. alpha-Subunit bursts were also significantly coincident with those of TSH in men, postmenopausal women, and hypothyroid subjects. Interestingly, TSH pulses were significantly concordant with those of LH and FSH, and all four hormones were significantly concordant in men, postmenopausal women, and hypothyroid subjects. In conclusion, the present findings imply that an underlying unified signal coordinates pulsatile hormone secretion from both gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs.\r"

IL-6 stimulated hCG secretion by trophoblasts to a level similar to that stimulated by a GnRH analog. The analog, however, released hCG by an IL-6-independent mechanism because PM-1, a monoclonal antibody specific for IL-6 receptors (R), failed to block GnRH-mediated responses, but completely blocked IL-6-mediated hCG secretion, suggesting the existence of two distinct regulatory pathways for hCG release. Immunohistochemical analysis with another IL-6-R-specific antibody, MT-18, showed that IL-6-R was located only on the trophoblast layer of the placenta. Our data revealed the existence of a local regulatory network by which trophoblast-derived IL-6 interacts with IL-6-R on the trophoblasts, resulting in hCG release. Thus, two different regulatory networks, an IL-6 and IL-6-R system and a GnRH and GnRH-R system, regulate hCG release by human trophoblasts independently.\r"

  ".W": "TRH is present in human normal pituitaries and in pituitary adenomas. In this study we demonstrated that the same tissues can release TRH in vitro. Fragments from seven normal pituitaries (10-15 mg/syringe) and dispersed cells from eight prolactinomas, four GH-secreting and two nonsecreting adenomas (1-3 x 10(6) cells/syringe) were perifused using a Krebs-Ringer culture medium. After 1 h of equilibration the perifusion medium was collected every 2 min (1 mL/fraction) for 3 h. TRH, PRL, and GH were measured by RIA under basal conditions and in the presence of 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L dopamine (DA), alone or concomitant with haloperidol, or in the presence of 10(-10) or 10(-6) mol/L somatostatin. Both normal pituitary fragments and pituitary adenomatous cells (from all types of adenomas studied) spontaneously released TRH in vitro. TRH was detected in the perifusion medium either immediately after the end of the equilibration period or 30-60 min later. The molecular identity of TRH was assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography. There was no difference in the profile and the rate of TRH secretion between normal and tumoral tissues, and no correlation was found between the level of TRH release and that of PRL or GH secretion. DA stimulated TRH release from normal pituitaries and from PRL- and GH-secreting adenomas at doses as low as 10(-10) mol/L. A concomitant decrease in PRL and GH release was observed from adenomatous cells and in one case of normal tissue. Haloperidol (10(-7) mol/L) antagonized the effect of 10(-8) mol/L DA on both TRH and PRL secretion in normal pituitary and in prolactinomas. DA had no effect on TRH release from two nonsecreting tumors. The amounts of TRH released during 1 h of perifusion were 60-1640 pg/2 mg wet wt tissue in normal pituitaries and 54-2174 pg/10(6) cells in adenomas; these values were very high compared to those precedently reported within the tissues. These results indicate that pituitary cells can release TRH in vitro and suggest that TRH might be synthesized in situ. We suggest that TRH could act on pituitary hormone secretion and/or cell proliferation via a paracrine and/or an autocrine mechanism.\r"

We performed a dose-response study with GHRH-44-NH2 (GHRH) given by nasal spray and closely monitored local tolerance. Twelve normal young men were given 5 GNRH doses (125, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 micrograms) and placebo in random order according to a latin square design. Mild symptoms of local intolerance, subjective, objective, or both, were noted in the first 20 min after spray in 30 of 72 tests, and a significant difference (P = 0.003) was obtained in their frequency between the group placebo plus the lowest dose and the group of the other doses. The areas under the GH curves were significantly different between the subjects and the doses (by analysis of variance, P = 0.001 and P = 0.025, respectively). Multiple comparison tests showed a significant difference between the 3 highest doses and the placebo (P = 0.005, P = 0.05, and P = 0.02, respectively) and a significant difference between the highest dose and the 2 lowest doses (P = 0.005). By weighted linear regression between GH areas under the curve and GHRH doses the dose-response relationship was established as: y = 1.226x + 457. The magnitude of the GH peaks induced by in GHRH was significantly lower than that induced by iv GHRH. We conclude that in the normal young men tested, who were high responders to GHRH (as demonstrated by iv test), a 500-micrograms dose is sufficient to elicit GH secretion. Local tolerance, although imperfect, appears satisfactory to permit a clinical trial in children.\r"

  ".U": "90338329\r", 
  ".W": "In chronic hypercalcemia, basal TSH has been found to be low, with normal serum circulating concentrations of T3 and T4. This observation suggested a potentiation by hypercalcemia of the thyroid secretory response to TSH. The present study was undertaken to assess the possible influence of hypercalcemia on the T3 secretory response to TSH. Since T3 secretion was studied after stimulation of endogenous TSH by TRH, it was first necessary to find a protocol enabling us to study the effect of calcium on T3 release without affecting TSH secretion. Eighteen subjects underwent two TRH tests, with and without simultaneous calcium infusion, at 2-week interval and in a randomized order. In group A (five subjects) calcium infusion started 1 min after TRH, in group B (five subjects) 10 min after TRH, and in group C (eight subjects) 20 min after TRH. In groups A and B, TSH secretion was markedly blunted by hypercalcemia. In contrast, when calcium infusion was started 20 min after TRH (group C), the TSH secretion profile was no longer different from that in the control study. However, in this situation the increments of T3 and free T3 120 and 180 min after TRH were significantly higher when the subjects were rendered hypercalcemic than in the control study. These findings suggest that calcium might act at two different levels, to enhance the thyroid secretory response to TSH and decrease TSH secretion by acting directly on the pituitary gland. Both effects would produce the association of low serum TSH and normal levels of T3 and T4 observed in chronic hypercalcemia.\r"

  ".W": "To study regulation of the secretion of human pituitary GH (hGH) and placental GH (hPGH) in the pregnant woman and human fetus, the GH-releasing factor Sermorelin [GRF-(1-29)-NH2] was administered to pregnant women at term (n = 5), just before elective cesarean section; saline was administered in control studies (n = 5). The effects of GRF-(1-29)-NH2 administration on maternal and fetal serum concentrations of hGH and GRF-(1-29)-NH2 and maternal serum levels of hPGH were evaluated at birth. The mean time span between injection and birth was 20 min (range, 15-25 min). Cord serum hGH concentrations were similar in infants of GRF-(1-29)-NH2-injected mothers and control infants. GRF-(1-29)-NH2 elicited a consistent but small rise in maternal hGH serum concentrations (P = 0.08), whereas hPGH concentrations remained unaltered. Finally, GRF-(1-29)-NH2 concentrations were undetectable in cord serum, but readily detectable in concomitantly obtained maternal serum. In conclusion, these data suggest that hGH secretion in the pregnant woman at term is suppressed at the pituitary level, that GRF does not affect hPGH secretion, and that fetal hGH secretion is independent of circulating maternal GRF, probably because of lack of transplacental GRF passage.\r"

Double immunoenzymatic staining of frozen sections of 14 samples of human spleen showed that gamma delta bearing T cells were preferentially localised in the red pulp of this organ where on average they accounted for 17% of all T cells. There was no correlation between the number of gamma delta T cells and the diagnosis, with the exception of a case of malaria in which an unusually high number (40%) of T cells were of this type. The gamma delta bearing T cells were scattered randomly through the red pulp, and double staining combined with a marker of splenic sinusoids (CD36) showed that almost all lie outside the sinusoids within the cords of the red pulp. It is suggested that the double immunoenzymatic technique could be used for further studies of the prevalence of gamma delta bearing T cells in lymphocytic infiltrates.\r"

To investigate this several strains of bacteria and fungi commonly found in urine were exposed to different concentrations of boric acid in nutrient broth. Viable counts were made at the outset and at intervals for up to 24 hours at room temperature to detect bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects. At concentrations between 10 and 20 g/l boric acid was bacteriostatic or fungistatic for very nearly all the common urinary pathogens. At 10 g/l boric acid was weakly bactericidal for some strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though higher concentrations were bacteriostatic only. Group B streptococci varied in their response to boric acid, but for most of them 10 or 20 g/l was satisfactorily bacteriostatic. It is concluded that boric acid is rarely toxic, and when it is, the effect is usually sufficiently delayed to be of only theoretical importance.\r"

The patients had significantly higher plasma fibrinogen concentrations than controls by both methods, but there was significant overlap between the two groups when fibrinogen was assayed by the thrombin clotting technique; there was almost complete separation of the two groups using the immunochemical assay. This difference in overlap could not be attributed to the presence or absence of fibrinogen degradation products. These findings may have important implications for the choice of method for determining plasma fibrinogen when assays are used for the assessment of cardiovascular risk. It is recommended that plasma fibrinogen should be assayed by both an immuno-chemical and a thrombin clotting method.\r"

Duodenal and jejunal disaccharidase values were compared and the association between disaccharidase activity and morphology in the duodenum was examined. Mean lactase activities were about 40% lower in the duodenum compared with the jejunum; maltase was reduced to a lesser extent; and sucrase activities were much the same in the two sites. Lactase deficiency was found in 24 patients of whom 14 (58%) had duodenal disease. The presence of moderate to severe duodenal lesions was associated with a significant decrease in all disaccharidase activities, while only lactase was reduced in mild lesions. Twelve patients had normal lactase activity, despite the presence of duodenal disease. It is concluded that specific reference ranges for duodenal mucosal disaccharidase activity are required as this is less than that of jejunum. Reduced duodenal disaccharidase activity is usually but not invariably associated with morphological abnormality.\r"

T cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangements were observed in six out of nine cases of CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytoses and provided clear evidence for clonality in this group. The T cell proliferations in two of the remaining cases masked B cell lymphocytic leukaemia and hairy cell leukaemia, while in the third case no cause was found for the polyclonal proliferation. Heterogeneity of phenotype and genotype were observed in peripheral T cell lymphomas: one out of six cases showed TcR gene rearrangement, one case retained its germline configuration, a further case masked B cell lymphoma and the remainder were polyclonal. Genotypic analysis was helpful in the analysis of a tumour of mixed T cell and myeloid phenotype which was shown to be germline for TcR and immunoglobulin genes, consistent with a myeloid origin. Two histiocytic tumours were found to have clonal rearrangement of TcR genes. Nine out of 11 B cell tumours showed immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. It is concluded that genetic analyses are useful in the analysis of T cell, histiocytic, and B cell tumours in which an immunoglobulin phenotype cannot be defined.\r"

Patients who were continuously colonised with Ps aeruginosa gave the highest titres: range 1500-64000 (mean 11000) and 500-48000 (mean 9000) with homologous 0-typable and 0-defective isolates, respectively. Lower titres to both varieties of isolates were obtained with recently colonised patients, and non-colonised patients gave titres with reference laboratory strains marginally above those of healthy controls. Serum titres of patients with sequential isolates were strain dependent and did not correlate with the 0-antigen state of the strain. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot analysis of these sera and strains showed antibody binding primarily to high molecular weight 0-repeating units of lipopolysaccharide. It is concluded that the 0-antigen of the strain of Ps aeruginosa used in the ELISA test does not influence the titre obtained with fibrocystic sera, and it is recommended that serum titres should be assessed with a panel of homologous isolates from patients.\r"

Freshly harvested lymph node cells from B10.A mice immunized with the cytochrome c fragment 81-104 did not produce detectable amounts of IL-4 upon Ag stimulation. However, after one cycle of bulk in vitro restimulation, the same cells could be stimulated to secrete IL-4. The development of Ag-specific IL-4-producing cells during the in vitro culture could be influenced by different culture conditions. When IL-4 and IL-1, in the presence of anti-IL-2R antibodies, were added to the bulk culture, secondary stimulation of the cells revealed increased levels of IL-4 production and constant or decreased levels of IL-2 production. The addition of IFN-gamma during the bulk culture led to a decrease in IL-4 production, yet had no effect on IL-2 production. When anti-IL-4 antibodies were present during the restimulation culture, no IL-4 was produced in the final stimulation assay. In addition, T cells cultured at high cell density produced more IL-4 in a secondary stimulation than did T cells cultured at low cell density. These results demonstrate that culture conditions during a short term culture of freshly harvested primed T cells may profoundly influence the development of IL-4-producing cells. This may be caused either by selective expansion or inhibition of preexisting IL-4-producing T cells, or by the differentiation of precursors of IL-4-producing cells.\r"

Addition of IL-4 to an organ culture of 14-day-old fetal BALB/c thymus resulted in a decreased cell yield (less than 15% as compared to the control culture) and in a complete inhibition of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes after 12 days of culture. This IL-4 effect was time dependent as shorter times (less than 6 days) resulted in a thymic development comparable to the untreated control. When thymuses at later stages of gestation were treated with IL-4, the inhibition was less pronounced. The inhibitory activity of IL-4 was abrogated by the anti-IL-4 mAb 11B11, ruling out the possibility of a contaminant. Organ cultured 14-day-old fetal thymocytes treated with IL-4 during 12 days responded vigorously to IL-2 alone and to IL-4 + PMA + ionomycin. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-4 affects the intrathymic T cell development at an early stage.\r"

  ".U": "90338738\r", 
  ".W": "We used three anti-human anti-CD3 mAb each recognizing different surface CD3 epitopes to differentially perturb the CD3/TCR complex on the surface of Jurkat T cells. In the presence of phorbol ester, these anti-CD3 mAb triggered differential IL-2 production in Jurkat T cells, which could not be explained by differences in kinetics of IL-2 production, by differences in IL-2 adsorption caused by differential surface expression of p55 or p75 IL-2R, by effects on IL-2 secretion rather than actual synthesis, or by differential toxicities of the anti-CD3 mAb to Jurkat cells. In addition, this differential anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production could not be explained by differences in mAb isotype or in avidities of the anti-CD3 mAb for the Jurkat cells. Moreover, anti-CD3 mAb covalently immobilized onto beads also differentially induced IL-2 production in Jurkat cells, suggesting that the differential IL-2 response is not based on differential rates of anti-CD3-induced modulation of Jurkat cell surface CD3. Although differences among the anti-CD3 mAb in the initial rates of binding to Jurkat cell were observed, this was also believed unlikely to explain the differential IL-2 response. Regardless of the anti-CD3 mAb used, anti-CD3-induced total inositol phosphate (IP) production did not necessarily correlate with anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production. Nevertheless, despite the differences among the anti-CD3 mAb in inducing IL-2 production, the calcium responses were grossly similar. Taken together, these observations indicate that CD3/TCR-mediated IL-2 production in Jurkat cells can be dissociated from total IP generation, and the basis of differential CD3/TCR-mediated IL-2 production in these cells does not appear to be at the level of the initial activation-induced calcium response. These studies suggest that the nature of the CD3/TCR ligand (its physical form and/or the specific epitope it perturbs) can either directly influence intracellular events distal to the generation of IP and increase in intracellular free calcium leading to differential IL-2 production or can trigger IP-independent pathways that affect IL-2 production.\r"

  ".U": "90338739\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelial cells (EC) were cocultured with allogeneic PBL, CD4+ T cells, or CD8+ T cells, and the degrees of EC activation induced examined by determining patterns of endothelial class I and class II MHC and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. Coculture with PBL or CD8+ T cells uniformly increases class I MHC and ICAM-1 expression on all EC within a culture, but induces class II MHC expression on only a subpopulation(s) of EC. This heterogeneous EC response to coculture contrasts with the uniform class II expression on all EC induced by IFN-gamma in replicate wells. CD4+ T cells, when compared to equal numbers of unfractionated PBL or CD8+ T cells, are more effective at increasing class I MHC and ICAM-1 but are unable to induce class II MHC expression. The failure of CD4+ T cells to induce EC class II MHC Ag is not due to insufficient activation of the T cells, as PHA-activated CD4+ T cells also do not induce significant class II expression. In addition, conditioned media (CM) from CD4+ T cell/EC contain greater levels of immunoreactive IFN-gamma than do CM from PBL/EC cocultures. Rather, CD4+ T cells appear to actively inhibit the induction of EC class II Ag but not class I or ICAM-1 by IFN-gamma. Inhibition occurs at the time of induction, as CD4+ T cells are not capable of down-regulating previously induced class II Ag. CM from CD4+/EC (but not PBL/EC) cocultures also inhibits IFN-gamma induction of EC class II MHC expression. The inhibitory activity is generated during CD4+ T cell-EC cell contact, and is enhanced by PHA. The inhibitory activity(ies) of the CD4+/EC-CM is as yet unidentified, and is only minimally reversible by cocktails of neutralizing antibodies directed against TNF-alpha, TNF-beta (lymphotoxin), IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. In conclusion, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are each effective activators of EC, but the patterns of activation produced by these subsets are quite distinct, largely due to generation of a soluble inhibitor(s) of class II MHC induction during coculture of CD4+ T cells with EC.\r"

Stimulation of monocytes with IL-2 induced a significant increase in c-fms mRNA relative to medium control that was observed as early as 6 h after IL-2 stimulation. Dose-response experiments showed that 100 U/ml of IL-2 were sufficient to enhance the expression of c-fms mRNA. In contrast, IFN-gamma did not modify the levels of c-fms transcript. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that IL-2 enhanced c-fms glycoprotein levels. Experiments in which monocytes were activated with IFN-gamma or IL-2 followed by macrophage CSF-1 and then tested for tumoricidal activity demonstrated that macrophage CSF-1 sustained the cytotoxic activity induced by IL-2 but not by IFN-gamma. These data demonstrate that IL-2 enhances c-fms mRNA and c-fms glycoprotein expression suggesting that IL-2, by augmenting expression of macrophage CSF-1 receptors, can lead to prolongation of monocyte-mediated tumoricidal activity obtained in the presence of exogenous macrophage CSF-1.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies have demonstrated that high dose IL-2 (1000 U/ml) alone can induce human peripheral blood T cell pore-forming protein (PFP) mRNA expression and cytotoxic potential. We now report that the levels of IL-2 needed to induce these effects in T cells can be significantly reduced in the presence of IL-6. IL-6 and suboptimal doses of IL-2 (10 U/ml) were found to costimulate PFP mRNA expression and cytotoxic potential in resting human peripheral blood T cells, whereas IL-6 or low dose IL-2 alone had no effect. The induction of T cell PFP mRNA by IL-2/IL-6 was extremely rapid and increases in both PFP mRNA expression and cytotoxic potential were IL-6 dose dependent. The costimulatory effect of IL-6 did not appear to involve the IL-2/IL-2R pathway in as much as IL-6 did not induce IL-2 production or detectably increase IL-2R surface expression in T cells. These findings, in addition to the rapid induction of PFP mRNA by IL-2/IL-6, suggested that IL-6 can directly and independently provide an additional signal to augment the differentiation of CTL. In contrast to the results observed in T cells, IL-6 and IL-2 could enhance CD3- large granular lymphocyte (LGL) NK activity, but IL-6 either alone or in combination with IL-2 had no effect on constitutive PFP mRNA expression in resting LGL. These data further confirm that different mechanisms may be responsible for lymphokine activation of CTL and LGL in human peripheral blood. In particular it appears that IL-6 acts as a costimulatory signal with IL-2 in generating CTL and that IL-6 functions in part by acting in synergy with IL-2 to induce PFP, a major lytic protein involved in lymphocyte cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Ia expression is an important marker of macrophage functional capacity. IFN-gamma induces Ia expression on perhaps all murine macrophages, whereas IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and CSF-1 induce Ia on restricted sets of macrophages. Inhibitors of expression include PGE2, glucocorticoids, and IFN-beta. TNF has been found to augment Ia expression on several macrophage lineage cell lines but to inhibit expression on murine peritoneal macrophages. Our study shows that TNF can have opposite effects on Ia expression (induced by IFN-gamma) on thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, depending on the length of time cells are treated and on the presence of other modulators. In particular, TNF augmented early expression induced by IFN-gamma but inhibited later expression. And although TNF synergized with PGE2 to markedly inhibit Ia induction on these cells, it partially antagonized the inhibition by corticosterone and IFN-beta. TNF and PGE2 also synergized to inhibit Ia expression induced on bone marrow-derived and splenic macrophages by either IFN-gamma or IL-4. In contrast to their effect on Ia expression, TNF and PGE2 had opposite effects on expression of gamma 2a FcR in macrophages. TNF blocked the increase in FcR expression due to any combination of PGE2, IFN-gamma, and IFN-beta. However, TNF and PGE2 both increased expression of gamma 2a FcR on WEHI-3 cells. If the different effects of TNF reflect the differentiation states of macrophages, its effects on Ia and FcR expression may vary with the progression of an immune response.\r"

  ".U": "90338755\r", 
  ".W": "Prosolin is a major cytosolic phosphoprotein of proliferating normal PBL. Treatment of growing PBL with phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) or calcium ionophore (A23187) for 1 h caused phosphorylation of prosolin with the production of up to four prominent phosphorylated forms differing in degree of phosphorylation and/or two-dimensional electrophoretic mobility (peptides B to E). Formation of these phosphopeptides coincided with rapid down-regulation of DNA synthesis. A23187 was particularly effective in inducing phosphorylation of the more highly phosphorylated peptides D and E, suggesting the existence of a (Ca2+)-activated mechanism in their phosphorylation. The T cell leukemia cell lines Jurkat, HuT-78, CCRF-CEM, and Molt-4 showed reduced to absent ability to phosphorylate prosolin peptides rapidly in response to A23187 and also showed diminished down-regulation of DNA synthesis. In leukemic cells treated with both TPA and A23187, peptides B and C were rapidly phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation of peptides D and E seen in normal PBL remained deficient. The T cell leukemic cells appear to have intact a TPA-activated mechanism for phosphorylating prosolin peptides B and C, but share an impairment of a specific Ca2(+)-activated mechanism, possibly a Ca2(+)-dependent protein kinase, required for phosphorylation of prosolin phosphopeptides D and E. The degree of rapid down-regulation of DNA synthesis was correlated with degree of phosphorylation of peptide E in PBL and in three of four T cell leukemic cell lines. Thus, rapid phosphorylation of prosolin may mediate responses to TPA and A23187 in normal proliferating PBL, including down-regulation of DNA synthesis. A deficiency of this pathway in leukemic T cells may impede their response to physiologic growth regulatory signals utilizing this pathway and contribute to unrestrained cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of cutaneous sensory nerves induces vasodilatation and vascular permeability, i.e., neurogenic inflammation. We examined the histology and possible mast cell involvement in cutaneous neurogenic inflammation induced by electrical nerve stimulation (ENS). Three lines of evidence indicated that mast cells were not involved in rodent cutaneous neurogenic inflammation induced by electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve. 1) Most mast cells (86.5% of all mast cells in the dorsal skin of the paw) were found in the deep dermis, whereas vessels developing increased vascular permeability after nerve stimulation (visualized with the supravital dye Monastral blue B, a macro-molecular tracer) were localized predominantly in the superficial dermis. By contrast, i.v. substance P, which also causes increased cutaneous vascular permeability, predominantly caused deeper vessels to leak. As analyzed by electron microscopy, the vessels that developed permeability in response to nerve stimulation, and were thereby stained with Monastral blue B, were found to be exclusively postcapillary venules. 2) Disodium cromoglycate (DSCG), a mast cell stabilizing compound, inhibited the cutaneous vascular permeability induced by intradermal injections of anti-IgE in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, vascular permeability induced by ENS was not influenced by disodium cromoglycate treatment. 3) ENS and i.v. substance P both induced cutaneous vascular permeability in mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, despite the fact that their skin contained only 4.7% of the mast cells present in their normal +/+ litter mates. The magnitude of ENS-induced vascular permeability responses in W/Wv mice were similar to control +/+ and BALB/c mice. This study supports our earlier observations suggesting that mast cell activation is not essential for the initial, vascular permeability phase of neurogenic inflammation in rodent skin.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of nephrotoxic serum into rats results in glomerular inflammation and proteinuria. Rats placed on an essential fatty acid (EFA)-deficient diet are protected from the glomerular macrophage infiltration and the ensuing proteinuria. To account for this protection, we studied EFA-deficient rats to determine if there were defects in macrophage chemotaxis. We also investigated the possibility that EFA deficiency diminishes the production of a glomerular chemoattractant for monocytes. In microchemotaxis assays EFA-deficient macrophages migrated normally. EFA-deficient serum did not appear to contain a chemotactic inhibitor. Cultured glomeruli from control and control nephritic rats were found to elaborate a chemoattractant for monocytes. This chemoattractant activity was markedly enhanced after induction of nephritis, was heat stable, was not altered by inhibition of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or platelet-activating factor, and did not depend on C or the glomerular inflammatory cell infiltrate. EFA-deficient glomeruli harvested from animals receiving injections with nephrotoxic serum produced markedly less chemoattractant activity than glomeruli from control nephritic animals. Lipid extraction of nephritic glomeruli from control animals yielded chemoattractant activity in the organic phase. Extracts of EFA-deficient nephritic glomeruli had considerably less activity. We propose that EFA deficiency attenuates glomerular inflammation by inhibiting the ability of glomeruli to produce a specific lipid monocyte chemoattractant after exposure to a nephritic stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "The depletion of an essential amino acid, tryptophan, caused by induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), has been shown to be a mechanism involving self-defense against inhaled microorganisms and tumor growth. We recently reported that the IDO is dramatically (approximately 50-fold) induced in allografted tumor (3-methylcholanthrene-induced ascites type tumor cells) cells undergoing rejection, and that the enzyme is induced by factor(s) released through the interaction of allografted tumor cells with infiltrating leukocytes. The culture supernatant of infiltrating leukocytes, which were harvested on day 7 after tumor transplantation, induced the highest IDO activity in the tumor cells. The inducer activity was completely neutralized by the addition of antibody to IFN-gamma but not by antibody to IFN-alpha/beta. Approximately 6 U/ml of IFN-gamma was detected by an ELISA assay in the 12-h culture supernatant with 2 x 10(6) leukocytes/ml, and rIFN-gamma at 6 U/ml induced IDO in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced ascites type tumor cells to the same extent as IFN-gamma in the culture supernatant. Moreover, i.p. administration of antibody to IFN-gamma almost completely inhibited the induction of IDO in the allografted tumor cells. These observations indicate that the factor responsible for IDO induction in the allografted tumor cells is IFN-gamma.\r"

The response is significantly down-modulated in chronically infected mice by Ag-specific Ts cells. The present study was undertaken to establish an in vitro model by which TDH-Ts cell interactions could be analyzed. To this end, Ts cells were induced in vitro by preculture of chronic or acute infection spleen cells with soluble egg Ag (SEA) for 48 h. The induced cells suppressed the SEA-specific proliferation of acute infection spleen cells by 80 to 95%. The induced suppressor cells were Ag specific in both induction and elicitation of function, and were not cytotoxic to the acute infection splenic target cells. Suppression by the induced cells was manifested within the first 24 h of the SEA-induced response as IL-2 produced by acute infection spleen cells was suppressed 62%. Phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry of the induced suppressor cells showed that CD8+ cells from acute infection spleens and CD4+ and CD8+ cells from chronic infection spleens were effector Ts cells. Taken together, CD4+ and CD8+ SEA-specific Ts cells can be induced in vitro to effectively suppress the SEA-specific lymphoproliferation and IL-2 production of acute infection spleen cells. Establishment of this in vitro model will allow us to further analyze the mechanisms of Ts cell-mediated suppression of TDH cells.\r"

UVA induction of inflammation in human skin is thought to be mediated by membrane lipid derived products. In order to investigate the mechanism of this response we examined the effect of UVA on phospholipid metabolism of human epidermal keratinocytes in culture. Keratinocytes were grown in serum free low calcium medium. The cells were prelabeled with [3H] arachidonic acid or [3H] choline and irradiated with UVA (Honle 2002-Hg vapor lamp). Identification and quantitation of specific membrane phospholipid-derived components was achieved using high-performance liquid chromatography, paper chromatography, and radioimmunoassay. UVA resulted in a linear dose dependent release of [3H] arachidonic acid into medium between 1 and 20 joule/cm2. This response was inhibited in an oxygen-reduced environment. The radiolabel released was predominantly free arachidonate and cyclooxygenase metabolites. Cyclooxygenase metabolites prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin derivative, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a, were stimulated following UVA irradiation, but the lipoxygenase metabolite, leukotriene B was not detected. Maximal release was measured immediately after irradiation and changed little over 24 h post-irradiation. UVA stimulated an increase of [3H] choline metabolites glycerophosphorylcholine and phosphorylcholine in media extracts suggesting UVA activation of phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 or diacylglyceride lipase.\r"

  ".W": "Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized in part by an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), and a strong association with the HLA antigens HLA-A1, -B8, -DR3, and -DQw2, essentially identical to that seen in patients with isolated GSE (celiac disease). A 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP has been identified using a DQ beta-chain cDNA and localized to the HLA-DP beta-chain region. This RFLP has been found more frequently in patients with isolated GSE than in normal HLA matched controls. We have analyzed genomic DNA from 24 patients with DH and 15 HLA-matched controls to determine if this 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP was present in patients with DH. Twenty-one of 24 (87%) of patients with DH were found to have this RFLP as compared to 7 of 10 (70%) HLA-DR3, -DQw2 matched control subjects (p = 0.23). Thus, the 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP detected in patients with isolated GSE is also present in patients with DH; however, its frequency in DH patients does not differ significantly from that of HLA matched controls. Family studies of patients with DH revealed that although the 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP segregated with the HLA-A1, -B8, -DR3, -DQw2 haplotype in one family, it did not segregate with this disease-associated haplotype in two other families. In both patient and control populations, this RFLP was associated with HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 phenotypes; 25 of 26 (96%) HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 subjects were found to have this RFLP compared to only 1 of 6 (17%) who did not express HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 (pc = 0.0009). These population and family data suggest that this 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP is primarily associated with the HLA-DPw1, -DPw3 phenotype, rather than the clinical manifestations of DH. These data further document that the strongest association of DH with HLA antigens remains with HLA-DQw2 and HLA-DR3 antigens.\r"

Cutaneous mast cells (CMC) were extracted from mouse ears after digestion with hyaluronidase and collagenase in MEM containing 25% fetal calf serum and purified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient. The histamine content of cells obtained from the 30/40% interface was 1.0 +/- 0.1 pg/cell (mean +/- SE), with a mast-cell purity of 68.6 +/- 4.4% and a viability of greater than 93%. Peritoneal mast cells (PMC) were obtained by lavage with modified Tyrode's buffer followed by purification on 22.5% and 3-9% metrizamide gradients. The histamine content of cells was 12.2 +/- 0.8 pg/cell, with a mast-cell purity of 95.9 +/- 0.6% and a viability of greater than 95%. Histamine release induced by A23187 from CMC peaked at 3.0 microM A23187 (19.1 +/- 4.2%), at 3.0 min (22.3 +/- 2.3%), and at 30 degrees C (17.6 +/- 2.6%). In contrast, histamine release from PMC peaked at 8.0 microM of A23187 (49.4 +/- 12.1%) and at 15.0 min (48.5 +/- 12.2%). Release of histamine from PMC was observed at all the temperatures tested from 22 to 45 degrees C. Histamine release from CMC and PMC induced by A23187 was calcium dependent. Histamine release induced by compound 48/80 from CMC peaked at 0.5 micrograms/ml of compound 48/80 (23.0 +/- 7.4%) and at 5.0 min incubation (16.3 +/- 2.0%), whereas release from PMC peaked at 10.0 micrograms/ml (31.9 +/- 2.6%); release from PMC was similar at all the time points examined (1-15 min). Histamine release induced by substance P (SP) from both CMC and PMC peaked at 5.0 microM (18.8 +/- 6.6% and 12.6 +/- 3.7%, respectively); however, the maximal release from CMC occurred at 3.0 min (18.2 +/- 3.2%) and from PMC at 30.0 min (11.4 +/- 2.0%). SP-induced histamine release from CMC was calcium dependent, whereas release from PMC was only partially inhibited by EDTA. This study demonstrated that functional heterogeneity exists between these two populations of mast cells.\r"

It was not known, however, if this loss of antigenic activity was due to destruction, internalization, or cleavage of the antigen itself. In the present study we investigated the fate of the PF antigen after trypsinization of viable human skin. By using Concanavalin-A agarose affinity chromatography, we could partially purify an antigenic glycoprotein fraction that was released by trypsinization into the medium. This antigenic fraction was radiolabeled and tested by immunoprecipitation using sera from endemic pemphigus foliaceus or fogo selvagem (FS), non-endemic pemphigus foliaceus (NEPF), pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients, and sera from normal subjects as controls. Immunoprecipitated labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All FS sera (20 of 20 FS and five of five NEPF) and 46% of the PV sera (six of 13) immunoprecipitated a band of 45-kD molecular weight. Sera from FS patients in prolonged clinical and serological remission (seven of 10), sera from BP patients (five of five), and sera from normal donors (nine of nine) did not precipitate this 45-kD band. This study showed that a fragment of the PF antigen is released by trypsinization of human skin as a soluble immunoreactive glycopeptide of 45-kD molecular weight. Additionally, this procedure has generated sufficient quantities of the PF antigen for further biochemical characterization.\r"

CTL effectors were cloned from alloantigen-primed cultures by limiting dilution in the presence of antigenic B lymphoblastoid cells (BCLL) and IL-2. These T-cell clones lysed appropriate BCLL and PHA blasts but not third-party BCLL or K562. Lysis of antigenic BCLL was specifically blocked by antibodies against CD3 or class-I antigens. Specificity of the clones for conventional class-I antigen was demonstrated by cytotoxicity tests employing a panel of HLA-typed BCLL. The clones specifically lysed KC syngeneic with the original effector immunogen, and lysis was also blocked by anti-class-I antibodies. The effect of IFN-g treatment was to increase KC susceptibility to lysis by these clones. From 3-25 times more LU were measured against IFN-g-treated KC than against nontreated KC, and the degree of enhancement was similar for KC treated with concentrations of IFN-g ranging from 2.5-200 U/ml. This effect of IFN-g treatment on KC lysis by CTL, which was detected after only 24 h at all doses tested, emphasizes the potential role of IFN-g in enhancing CTL-mediated antiviral epidermal immunity and in exacerbating epidermal disease mediated by specific lytic T cells. In addition, the finding that normal human KC can be recognized by MHC class-I-specific CTL demonstrates that KC do express conventional class-I-antigens and that KC lysis by CTL can occur independently of exogenous cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Human melanocyte expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) with or without stimulation by interferon gamma (IFN-G), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1 alpha), was measured utilizing direct immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Melanocytes grown in vitro expressed low levels of ICAM-1, which could be increased by exposing the cells to IFN-G, TNF-alpha, or IL-1 alpha. Each cytokine caused an enhancement of melanocyte ICAM-1 expression in a dose-dependent fashion. The lowest dose necessary to cause a significant increase in melanocyte ICAM-1 expression was 1 U/ml IFN-G, 0.3 ng/ml TNF-alpha, or 3 U/ml IL-1 alpha. Melanocytes were most sensitive to TNF-alpha stimulation, with the greatest levels of ICAM-1 expression following 30 ng/ml or more TNF-alpha. When IFN-G was added to melanocyte cultures in combination with TNF-alpha or IL-1 alpha, there was an additive increase in ICAM-1 expression but no synergy was noted with the combined cytokines. To our knowledge, this is the first report of melanocyte ICAM-1 induction by TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha and by physiologically relevant doses of IFN-G. Because of the importance of ICAM-1 in the regulation of immune cell-target interactions, the study of ICAM-1 expression by melanocytes may help us to better understand immune mechanisms of melanocyte injury.\r"

Twenty-seven multiple gestations conceived following IVF-ET resulted in the delivery of 20 sets of twins and three sets of triplets. One quadruplet pregnancy was terminated due to heavy bleeding. There were four \"vanishing sacs,\" two of which resulted in a twin pregnancy and two in singletons. These were compared to 88 singleton IVF-ET gestations. The only significant difference found was the higher numbers of embryos transferred in the multiple gestation group. No difference was found between the two groups in diagnosis, stimulation protocol, estradiol, response, number of eggs, fertilization, and cleavage rate. Maternal age was younger in the multiple-gestation group, though not statistically significant. It is thus suggested that limitation of the number of embryos transferred is the only means to reduce the incidence of multiple gestations in IVF-ET.\r"

We reviewed the stimulation profiles of five such high-responder patients who failed to conceive during in vitro fertilization with ovarian stimulation using pure FSH. All patients had baseline LH/FSH greater than 1.5 and peak E2 greater than 800 pg/ml. One cycle was canceled prior to hCG administration because of marked ovarian response (E2 greater than 2500 pg/ml, multiple small follicles). In a subsequent cycle, all patients were pretreated with the gonadotropin releasing-hormone agonist (GnRHa) leuprolide acetate for 10-14 days prior to initiation of FSH for ovarian stimulation. Leuprolide was continued until the day of hCG administration. During cycles using GnRHa, there was a statistically significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in serum FSH on day 3 (less than 5 vs 8.3 mIU/ml), serum E2 on day 3 (14.6 vs 34.6 pg/ml), and peak serum E2 (1197.6 vs 1923.0 pg/ml). Patients during cycles with GnRHa had a greater number of preovulatory (8.6 vs 3.0) and total (12.4 vs 6.0) oocytes retrieved (P less than 0.05). The fertilization rate of preovulatory oocytes was also higher during cycles using GnRHa (83 vs 64%). Two pregnancies occurred in the cycles pretreated with GnRHa. These preliminary data indicate that in high-responder patients, a combination of GnRHa and pure FSH results in lower E2 levels during the stimulation cycle and a greater number of total and mature oocytes retrieved and fertilized.\r"

Of the five physiologic measurements, the increase in carbon dioxide production preceded the increase in rectal temperature by more than 120 seconds. End-tidal carbon dioxide was an unreliable indicator in the spontaneously breathing animal of approaching hyperthermia during spontaneous breathing due to a transient tachypnea, which decreased end-tidal carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide production (milliliters per minute) increased immediately and reached three to five times the control value. Blood pressure and heart rate were insensitive indicators of approaching hyperthermia.\r"

This instrumentation plays a major role in decision making both in the safe conduct of anesthesia and mechanical ventilation as well as in the detection and prevention of potentially catastrophic mishaps. For these reasons, a review of what has been learned regarding the instrumentation, collection, and interpretation of the clinical data, and the clinical value of the information is timely. The clinical significance of the carbon dioxide and oxygen waveforms, inspired to expired carbon dioxide and oxygen differences, alveolar-arterial gradients, and global supply-to-demand oxygen relationships measured by capnography, oxygraphy, and pulse oximetry are addressed in this essay.\r"

  ".W": "An economic evaluation was undertaken of a previously reported National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) trial of chemotherapy in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). That trial had demonstrated a survival benefit associated with the use of either vindesine and cisplatin (VP) or cyclosphosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP) in relation to best supportive care (BSC). The economic technique used in this evaluation was cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). All costs were determined from the viewpoint of two provincial health care plans. When compared with BSC, the survival benefit of 8 weeks in favor of patients receiving CAP chemotherapy was associated with an economic saving of $949.49 (in 1984 Canadian dollars). This translated into a savings of $6,171.69 per year of life gained. The mean survival benefit of 12.8 weeks that was obtained with VP chemotherapy compared with BSC was associated with an increased cost of $3,637.60 per patient, or $14,777.75 per year of life gained. The economic evaluation demonstrated that the majority of costs on each of the three treatment arms was related to hospitalization and not to the use of chemotherapy agents. These results compare favorably with estimates of cost-effectiveness (CE) of commonly used treatments for other diseases and demonstrate that a policy of supportive care is associated with costs that may exceed those of active treatment. It is concluded that economic factors should not adversely affect decisions regarding the use of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.\r"

All cases were confirmed as B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia by virtue of expression of CD19 and/or CD22, lack of T-cell antigens, and lack of surface-membrane immunoglobulin (Ig). The CD34 antigen was present in at least 10% of blast cells in 587 (73.8%) of the patients. There was no significant difference in presenting clinical characteristics between CD34+ and CD34- patients save for an increased incidence of CNS involvement at diagnosis in the latter. Patients with CD34+ leukemia were more likely to have blasts expressing CD22, CD9, and CD13 antigens but were less likely to coexpress CD20. Patients with pre-B (cytoplasmic mu) ALL were significantly more likely to lack CD34 on their blasts, while children with hyperdiploid ALL were more likely to be CD34+. Although remission induction rates were not significantly different between patients with CD34+ and CD34-ALL (P = .23), event-free survival was shorter for patients with CD34- leukemia (P = .0014). Even though CD34 expression was associated with certain other known prognostically favorable variables including hyperdiploidy and lack of cytoplasmic Ig, it had an independent favorable effect on treatment outcome, even after adjusting for competing prognostic factors.\r"

Inhibition of gamma-cystathionase activity with up to 0.02 mmol/L propargylglycine had no statistically significant effect on [35S]glutathione, [35S]sulfate or [35S]cysteine formation from [35S]methionine. However, treatment of cells with 2 mmol/L propargylglycine markedly inhibited the metabolism of [35S]methionine to [35S]glutathione by 93%, to [35S]sulfate by 88% and to [35S]cysteine by 89%; [35S]cystathionine accumulation in these incubation systems was 60 times control. Hepatic gamma-cystathionase activity in premature infants has been reported to be about 23% of mature levels (Zlotkin and Anderson, 1982; Pediatr. Res. 16: 65-68); this level of gamma-cystathionase activity may limit cysteine synthesis by the methionine transsulfuration pathway. No evidence for cysteine synthesis from serine and sulfide, which can be catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase, or for methionine metabolism by an S-adenosylmethionine-independent pathway was obtained.\r"

The present study investigated the rate of trimethyllysine biosynthesis during pregnancy in rats fed a lysine-restricted diet. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum a crystalline amino acid diet (18% amino acids) containing either 1.44% or 0.36% lysine. Food intakes were not significantly different between the two groups, either during 19 d of gestation or 12 d of lactation (p greater than 0.05). Trimethyllysine content and synthetic rates were not significantly different between the treatment groups for any of the five tissues tested at either of the two time points. Tissue carnitine content was not consistently affected by dietary lysine content. Liver carnitine content was significantly higher in control rat pups at 12 d of lactation than in pups in the lysine-deficient group. Pups in both groups had peptide-linked trimethyllysine levels in skeletal muscle that were 46% of those seen in the control adults. However, previous reports of higher protein turnover in the neonate would indicate that trimethyllysine is not limiting at this age. Under these experimental conditions, carnitine biosynthesis is not impaired because of restricted availability of trimethyllysine.\r"

Forty-two survivors of ALL had the trabecular bone density of the spine evaluated by quantitative computed tomography, 6 to 98 months (mean 42 months) after completion of chemotherapy. The ALL survivors had significantly lower bone density than age-, gender-, and race-matched nonleukemic control subjects had (10% less, p less than 0.001); this decrease was accounted for solely by the subset of patients who had received cranial irradiation (n = 30; p less than 0.001). The relative reduction in bone density in ALL survivors was unrelated to age at the time of diagnosis or time without therapy. The effects on bone density of 18 Gy and of 22.5 to 25.2 Gy were indistinguishable. We conclude that survivors of ALL commonly have reduced bone density in the lumbar spine and suggest that the diminution is related to nervous system irradiation, not to the disease or to chemotherapy.\r"

After the development of a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for digoxin in our laboratories, we analyzed sera of children in whom the fluorescence polarization immunoassay identified potentially toxic concentrations of the glycoside (greater than 3 nmol/L; 2.3 ng/ml). Sixteen of them were receiving long-term digoxin therapy, and one had an accidental overdose. The immunoassay yielded significantly higher concentrations (4.1 +/- 1.2 nmol/L; 3.2 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) than the HPLC method (3.3 +/- 1.6 nmol/L; 2.6 +/- 1.2 ng/ml; p less than 0.01). In five cases (30%) these differences were clinically significant because administration of digoxin had been discontinued in the presence of true digoxin concentrations within the therapeutic range and the lack of clinical toxic effects. These data suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring using immunoassays of digoxin may be too inaccurate to detect potential toxic effects, and that much more weight should be focused on clinical monitoring. The HPLC method for assay of digoxin is extremely meticulous and will not become clinically available; therefore the development of better immunoassays should be encouraged.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the superiority of indirect calorimetry (IC)-based enteral nutrition in burned patients, 49 adults with mean burns of 47% TBSA received feedings based either on the Curreri formula (CURR), or on IC, using enteral formulas with nonprotein calorie:nitrogen ratios of either 86:1, or 125:1. Intake in CURR patients was a mean 3,490 kcal/day, which exceeded resting energy expenditure (REE) by 43%, while IC patients received 3,530 kcal/day (1.2 x REE; p less than 0.05). Both groups maintained body weight and lymphocyte counts; survival was equal. Complications (diarrhea, nausea, hyperglycemia) were frequent in both groups, but their incidence did not differ. Patients fed the lower calorie:nitrogen ratio had greater cumulative nitrogen balance, with no increase in nitrogen excretion. It appears advisable to nourish burned patients with the minimal effective intake. While use of IC facilitates this goal, use of the Curreri formula provides acceptable approximation of caloric requirements in the early postburn period.\r"

Standard enteral nutrition uses products which contain intact protein and require digestion for absorption.

This study was performed to determine whether a peptide-based (PEP) product (Reabilan HN) was better tolerated and/or produced better hepatic protein responses in patients after trauma when compared to an intact-protein (PRO) formula (Osmolite HN). Eighteen trauma patients were prospectively randomized to PEP (n = 9) or PRO (n = 9) enteral diets administered via nasoduodenal tubes (within 1-2 days of injury). Visceral protein synthesis was assessed by measuring baseline and 1 week pre-albumin and transferrin levels. Diarrhea was defined as greater than 300 gm/day of stool. Groups were similar in age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), caloric intake, and protein intake. Protein levels increased significantly faster in PEP patients despite similar urea nitrogen excretion. Diarrhea developed in four (44%) PRO patients and none of the PEP patients. Three of the PRO patients were switched to PEP after one week and diarrhea subsided in all three patients. Peptide-based enteral diets are associated with better hepatic protein responses and less diarrhea compared to intact-protein diets.\r"

Trauma patients had a LOS of 13.1 days, average Trauma Score of 15, and operating loss for trauma patients totalled $1,310,625. Trauma as compared to all patients showed a greater variance in LOS (6.3 vs. 2.0 days), a higher case mix index (CMI) (1.93 vs. 1.40), and a greater loss per case (-$3,404 vs. -$979), respectively. The trauma group DRG weights correlated with revenue (r = 0.89; p less than 0.0001); however, there was no relation to profit/loss. Review of trauma patients' records revealed inaccurate coding. Corrections led to an increase in reimbursement of $132,000. Five DRGs were added in 1989 for multiple significant trauma (MST). Using the 1989 grouper, 30 patients were reassigned, with an increase in reimbursement of $250,000. Although these strategies reduce operating deficit by 29%, reimbursement for trauma care must be addressed further.\r"

Only those with the \"fittest\" collateral capacity survive this process of natural selection. Using the transcranial Doppler method in 55 patients with unilateral carotid occlusion, we tested the dependency of each cerebral hemisphere on the remaining patent carotid artery by digital carotid compression, and in 41 of these patients we also tested the carbon dioxide reactivity in each hemisphere. Both hemispheric dependency and carbon dioxide reactivity were compared to 15 healthy controls. Mean blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery were lower on the occluded side than on the patent side (p less than 0.003). When the patent carotid artery was compressed middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities on the occluded side were mainly independent of the patent carotid artery, but on the patent side there was a high degree of dependency (p less than 0.0001). Carbon dioxide reactivity did not differ between the hemispheres, but in hemispheres with total dependency, carbon dioxide reactivity was inversely proportional to the severity of stenosis (r = -0.63). Tests of cerebral collateral reserve in patients with unilateral carotid occlusion evaluated by carotid compression and cerebral carbon dioxide reactivity may discriminate between survivors and potential nonsurvivors before the patent carotid artery occludes.\r"

Experiments were performed to determine whether the endothelium-dependent responses to aggregating platelets are altered in vein grafts. Segments of jugular veins were grafted in the reverse position into the carotid arteries in 16 rabbits. After 4 weeks the patent grafts (14 of 16) were removed, and the endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In control veins aggregating platelets, adenosine diphosphate, and serotonin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. The platelet-induced relaxations were attenuated by apyrase (adenosine diphosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase) but not by methiothepin (serotonergic blocker). In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets were absent, and only contractions that could be attenuated by methiothepin were observed. In vein grafts, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to adenosine diphosphate were reduced, and only endothelium-independent contractions were observed in response to serotonin. These contractions were attenuated by methiothepin. These results suggest that (1) the endothelium exerts an inhibitory effects mediated mainly by adenosine diphosphate in response to aggregating platelets in rabbit jugular veins and (2) endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to aggregating platelets are impaired in vein grafts because of reduced endothelium-independent contractions in response to serotonin. This impairment of endothelium-dependent responses in vein grafts may contribute to failure of the grafts.\r"

Hippocampal EEG spectral power uniformly decreased during behavioral activation. EEG activation was quantitatively different among the 3 activated conditions, with the most prominent change occurring during the visuospatial task. The degree of EEG activation corresponded inversely with the site of epileptic focus during the verbal task. The results demonstrate the response of human hippocampal EEG to behavioral activation. The magnitude of EEG change may reflect the degree of functional activation of the given hippocampus.\r"

We examined 46 unselected patients under age 50 years with cerebral ischemia for anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) and lupus anticoagulants (LA), over a 3-year-period. Age- and sex-matched patients with other neurologic diseases served as a noncerebral ischemia comparison group to test whether (1) stroke/transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in young people is associated with aCL and/or LA, and (2) their presence is specific to cerebral ischemia. In the stroke/TIA group, 21 patients had aCL or LA and 25 had neither, whereas in the control group, 2 patients had aCL and 24 had neither. Equal numbers of stroke/TIA patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) had other stroke risk factors. Patients with aPL and cerebral ischemia, however, had a more frequent history of multiple events than those without them. These antibodies occur with undue frequency in young patients with stroke/TIA and are not associated with a concurrent diagnosis of systemic lupus in most cases. A coexistent aPL-associated prothrombotic state may be a key determinant of whether patients with atherosclerosis, mitral valve prolapse, or other structural lesions experience recurrent ischemia.\r"

Fresh tissue was diced into 2-mm3 explants and cultures were established in serum-free media. The media were assayed for IGF-I, IGF-II, and total protein. Patients treated with GnRH-a demonstrated a 34% reduction in uterine volume, whereas placebo-treated patients exhibited no change. The secretion of IGF-I and IGF-II by fibroid explants obtained from women treated with the GnRH-a was significantly less than that in tissue obtained from placebo-treated controls (P less than .01 and P less than or equal to .05, respectively). Similarly, the secretion of IGF-I and IGF-II by myometrial explants was significantly less in tissue obtained from women treated with GnRH-a (P less than .0001 for both IGF-I and IGF-II). Protein secretion by fibroid tissue obtained from women treated with GnRH-a was not significantly different when compared with tissue from placebo-treated controls.

Although part of the value of such surgery lies in the fact that it improves appearance, it differs from cosmetic surgery, because, unlike the latter, it is designed to restore only normal configuration for ocular alignment--straight and/or aligned with the object of regard. A wide array of diagnostic tests are used to determine the precise treatment required, the goal of which is to provide comfortable vision, normal head position, and normal human appearance. In some cases nonsurgical techniques can be used to treat strabismus, but there is no evidence that visual training is an effective means of straightening eyes in those cases where surgery is considered the treatment of choice. For the most common strabismus, essential infantile or \"congenital\" esotropia, 80+% of infants have \"straight\" eyes after the initial operation, and 90% after a second operation, most of these with \"straight eyes\" have residual deviation of 5 prism diopters of esotropia or less. More than 50% of surgically treated patients have stable, long-term satisfactory results. Considering the effort required on the part of the ophthalmologist, together with the physical and psychological benefit to the patient, the cost of strabismus surgery should be equal to that of any major ophthalmic surgical procedure. That strabismus surgery is compensated at a lower rate, than for example, cataract surgery, suggests that strabismus surgery is an excellent value.\r"

CDC also made progress in forming the Division of Injury Epidemiology and Control, which has developed an intramural cooperative program with other Federal agencies and an outreach effort to State and local public health departments. The Review Committee felt that, by all measures, the CDC response to the recommendations of the Academy's 1985 report, \"Injury in America,\" has been a success, and a national program for injury control is underway. However, the Committee made the following recommendations for further development and maturing of the CDC program: The CDC effort needs to gain institute status (National Institute for Injury Control) and appropriate funding to address research needs adequately. As the program grows, the organizational structure of the Institute should attain a balance of the five principal areas of injury control (epidemiology, prevention, biomechanics, acute care, and rehabilitation), assuring that CDC programs go beyond traditional public health approaches and identify the causes of injury as the key step toward effective control. CDC should continue the competitive evaluation and selection of research centers and demonstration projects, including State and local outreach programs, and should direct a major part (80 percent) of its injury control funds in this area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a population-based sample of 3,223 motor vehicle trauma cases, 68 percent of the patients had one or more injuries that were coded to the AIS 85 body region nonspecific category external. When the same patients' injuries were coded using the AIS 85-EM coding procedure, only 15 percent of the patients had injuries that could not be coded to a specific body region. With AIS 85-EM, the proportion of codable head injury cases increased from 16 percent to 37 percent, thereby improving the potential for identifying cases with head and threshold brain injury. The data suggest that body region coding of all injuries is necessary to draw valid and reliable conclusions about changes in injury patterns and their sequelae. The increased specificity of body region coding improves assessments of the efficacy of injury intervention strategies and countermeasure programs using epidemiologic methodology.\r"

  ".W": "The results of a randomized clinical trial of a prenatal self-help smoking cessation program are reported in terms of the pregnancy and cost outcomes. The study population were the socioeconomically and ethnically diverse members of a large health maintenance organization (HMO) who reported that they were smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit. The intervention consisted predominantly of printed materials received through the mail. Compared with the usual care control group, women assigned to the self-help program were more likely to achieve cessation for the majority of their pregnancy (22.2 percent versus 8.6 percent), gave birth to infants weighing on average 57 grams more, and were 45 percent less likely to deliver a low birth weight infant. An economic evaluation of the self-help program was conducted from the perspective of the sponsoring HMO. Based upon the expenditures associated with the neonates' initial hospital episode, the intervention had a benefit-cost ratio of 2.8:1. These findings provide strong evidence to support widespread incorporation of smoking cessation interventions as a standard component of prenatal care.\r"

  ".W": "Community water fluoridation has served the American public extremely well as the cornerstone of dental caries prevention activities for 45 years. The dental and general health benefits associated with the ingestion of water-borne fluorides have been well known by researchers for an even longer period. Continued research has repeatedly confirmed the safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of community water fluoridation in preventing dental caries for Americans regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, educational status, or socioeconomic level. Despite the obvious benefits associated with this proven public health measure, slow progress has been made toward achieving the 1990 national fluoridation objectives as listed in \"Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation.\" This paper documents the lagging pace of community fluoridation by reviewing and analyzing data reported in \"Fluoridation Census, 1985,\" a document published in late 1988 by the Public Health Service's Centers for Disease Control. Failure to attain the 1990 objectives is attributable to a combination of circumstances, including their low priority within many local, State, and Federal health agencies, inadequate funding at all levels of government, lack of a coordinated and focused national fluoridation effort, failure of most States to require fluoridation, lack of Federal legislation mandating fluoridation, general apathy of most health professional organizations toward fluoridation, misconceptions by the public about effectiveness and safety and, finally, unrelenting opposition by a highly vocal minority of the lay public.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Seven State health departments, those in Illinois, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin, have participated in an effort to utilize a variety of State-specific cancer-related data to describe the cancer burden in their State's population. The data were then used to develop a statewide cancer plan or supplement an existing plan to address the defined problems. Cancer data have not been well utilized in the planning of intervention programs in the past, and the efforts in these States can serve as models for data use in programs to prevent and control cancer and other chronic diseases. State-specific data can be used to rank needs and make a clear case that can influence decision makers regarding resource allocation. The purpose of this report is to describe the data sources and additional statistics that were used to provide a broad picture of the cancer burden that will aid in targeting and defining intervention needs. Mortality, incidence, risk factor prevalence, and hospital discharge data appear to be the most accessible and potentially useful of the data sources examined, whereas insurance claims data, sources of treatment data, and environmental data bases were less useful in planning intervention strategies.\r"

To determine the effects of these changes, diagnoses of 2,388 cases of primary liver cancer in the years 1973-80 were compared to the underlying causes of death recorded on the death certificates, using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Results showed that only 53 percent of the deaths were attributed on death certificates to primary liver cancer. In a reverse comparison of 2,977 death certificates from the years 1973-85 with an underlying cause of death of primary liver cancer, 83 percent had been diagnosed as liver cancer. However, among the certificates that specified cancer of the liver, not specified as primary or secondary, as the cause of death, only 40 percent had been diagnosed originally as liver cancer. The mortality of liver cancer can be either underestimated or overestimated depending on which disease classification categories are used.\r"

The Task Force on Black and Minority Health formed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 1985 subsequently recommended increased efforts to reduce risk factors for coronary heart disease in the black population. A stated focus of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's National Cholesterol Education Program has been that of reaching minority groups. This report describes a pilot cholesterol education program conducted in black churches by trained members of those churches. Cholesterol screening, using a Reflotron, and other coronary heart disease risk factor screening was conducted in six churches with predominantly black members and at a neighborhood library. A total of 348 persons with cholesterol levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) or higher were identified. At the time of screening, all were provided brief counseling on lowering their cholesterol and were given a copy of the screening results. Half of those identified, all members of one church, were invited to attend a 6-week nutrition education class of 1 hour each week about techniques to lower blood cholesterol. Information about cholesterol was also mailed to them. They were designated as the education group. Persons in the church were trained to teach the classes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sample size was 1,390 for Mexican American children, 397 for Puerto Rican children, and 114 for Cuban children. Puerto Rican children had the highest mean blood lead levels (11.5 micrograms per dl), followed by Mexican American children (10.4 micrograms per dl) and Cuban children (8.6 micrograms per dl, P less than .05). Puerto Rican children had the highest percent with elevated blood lead (2.7 percent); 1.6 percent of Mexican American children had elevated blood lead; less than 1 percent (0.9 percent) of the Cuban children had elevated blood lead (P less than .05). Mexican American girls had a lower mean blood lead level than did boys: 9.7 micrograms per dl versus 11.0 micrograms per dl (P less than .05). For both Puerto Rican and Mexican American children, younger age indicated a higher risk of having elevated blood lead levels. Mexican American children who lived in poverty had higher mean blood lead levels than did Mexican American children who did not live in poverty--11.6 micrograms per dl versus 9.6 micrograms per dl (P less than .05). Despite advances in primary prevention of lead toxicity in children during the past 10 years, many Hispanic children are at risk of lead toxicity. Approximately 19,000 Mexican American 4-11-year-old children living in the Southwest and approximately 8,000 Puerto Rican children living in the New York City area had elevated blood lead levels (greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per dl) during 1982-84.\r"

Black-white ratios of age-specific death rates for 1979-83 in Suffolk County were elevated for all causes for men and women in age groups from 35-44 to 55-64 years (but not for those 75 years or older), for ischemic heart disease for women (but not men) for age groups from 35-44 to 55-64 years, for diabetes mellitus for most ages (especially for females), and for cerebrovascular disease for both men and women for all age groups from 35-44 to 65-74 years. The age-specific proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) for ischemic heart disease within educational level (less than 12 years and 12 or more years of school) were lower for black than for white men but more similar for black and white women. For diabetes, the PMRs were higher for black versus white women within both educational levels. PMRs for cerebrovascular disease were higher for black than white men within the group of decedents with less than 12 years of education. The findings are discussed with reference to racial differences in the prevalence of poverty as well as possible differences in risk factors (for example, obesity) or medical care independent of poverty.\r"

The completeness of reporting of AIDS deaths to the California AIDS Registry (ARS) among Hispanics, blacks, and whites in 1985 and 1986 from the San Francisco Bay Area was investigated. Death certificates listing AIDS as a cause of death or associated condition were identified and cross-checked with cases reported to ARS, current to December 1988. Death certificates were checked by hand for racial or ethnic classification using a definition of Hispanic based on information available on certificates. Three causes of undercounting in ARS were identified: a death was not reported as an AIDS case at all, an AIDS case was reported to ARS but the person was listed as still living, or an AIDS death was reported to ARS with a different racial or ethnic classification. The proportion of cases not reported at all was similar for all three racial-ethnic groups (5-8 percent). The proportion of deaths reported for persons listed in the registry as still living was 12 percent for Hispanics and 9 percent for blacks, compared with 5 percent for whites. For Hispanics, under-counting was largely due to ethnic misclassification. Twenty percent of Hispanics had been counted as white in the AIDS registry. In comparison, 4 percent of blacks and 1 percent of whites were misclassified by race. AIDS deaths among blacks and Hispanics may be undercounted, even in an area with good AIDS surveillance systems. This suggests that overrepresentation of minorities among AIDS cases in the United States may be even greater than indicated by current reporting data.\r"

Seventy-one adults in four age groups who attended a free-meal program in northern California were recruited during a 1-month period in 1987. The majority of the respondents lived on the streets, in vehicles, or in substandard housing located in an area undergoing rapid urban redevelopment. Regardless of employment or government assistance, the income of 100 percent of the respondents fell below the Federal poverty level. Overall, the sociodemographic profile of the study population was remarkably similar to that of the general population of California adults. Sixty-six percent had completed high school, 78 per cent had lived in the city for 5 or more years and, at most, 23 percent reported serious alcohol or emotional problems. When compared with the nonhomeless poor, the homeless poor were slightly less educated, more mobile, and more likely to report alcohol and emotional problems. Larger differences were evident for health-related variables, with the homeless poor being significantly less likely to have health insurance coverage, to receive preventive health care, and to be nonsmokers than the nonhomeless poor (P values less than .05). There were also large differences in access to heated rooms, running hot water, and cooking facilities, with approximately 90 percent of the homeless poor reporting no access to these fundamental necessities.\r"

Estimates of workforce needs were based on background information and informed consensus judgments of workshop participants. The final report of the workshop was published in January 1988. The authors synthesize some of the consensus judgements and review data from a position paper developed for the workshop. The supply, demand, and projected need for new academicians in environmental health on both graduate and undergraduate levels through 1992 are estimated. These estimates are based on the need for persons trained in the various environmental health subspecialties identified during the workshop. Outlined are the number and educational backgrounds of new faculty required. The types of new training programs that are required to meet the needs for environmental health specialists through 1992 are discussed.\r"

In a telephone survey with random-digit dialing, interviewers asked Massachusetts residents ages 20 years and older how often they engaged in various aquatic activities, in what settings, and how often they drank alcohol in connection with participation in aquatic activities. Of 294 respondents, 79 percent of the men and 72 percent of the women reported participating in aquatic activities during August 1988, the month prior to the interview. Respondents were asked to identify their most recent aquatic activity. The mean number of days of participation in the month was 13. The most frequently reported aquatic activities were swimming (76 percent), followed by sunbathing (74 percent), power boating (25 percent), and fishing from shore (15 percent). Among those persons reporting participation in aquatic activities, 55 percent had been at the ocean on the most recent occasion, 26 percent at lakes or ponds, 17 percent at pools, and 2 percent at rivers. Among those persons reporting aquatic activities, 36 percent of the men and 11 percent of the women reported having drunk alcohol on the most recent occasion. Those who reported drinking in aquatic settings were more likely to report driving after drinking than those who did not drive. Implementation of new Federal regulations and State laws concerning drinking and boating should be accompanied by public education on the risks of drowning if aquatic activities and alcohol consumption are combined.\r"

Bite reports from Dallas, TX, for 1985 were analyzed for different aspects of the cat bite event, including characteristics of the cats, the people bitten, the wounds, and the attack events. Cat bites and scratches constituted 25 percent of the 2,494 reported animal bites. Biting cats were typically stray females. People 21 to 35 years old were bitten in numbers disproportionate to their numbers in the Dallas population. Females were the victims of a majority of bites. Although wounds were typically described as \"scratches\" of a hand or finger, 80 percent of all victims sought some form of treatment for their wound. The highest proportion of bites occurred from May through August from 9 am through 12 noon; unowned cats accounted for most wounds. Cat bit events may be explained by frequency of contact, that is, women prefer cats as pets; activities that bring people and cats into contact; and reaching toward cats to feed or pet them. More specific information on the causes of cat bites will enable educational programs to be established so that the rate of cat bites can be decreased at the community level.\r"

Indians younger than 15 years of age were not included in the analysis because of the changes in classification for Indian race in census reports for Indian children and adolescents, known decreases in Indian infant mortality, and the small number of deaths among Indian children and adolescents during the years 1960-79. Declines in mortality rates were observed for Indian men and women 75 years of age and older, men 65 through 74 years of age, and women 25 through 54 years of age. Overall, only 8 percent of men and 53 percent of women were in age groups that showed declining mortality rates for all causes of death during the years 1960-79. The greatest decline in mortality rates for men and women occurred among those 75 years of age and older. Mortality rates for Indians in Minnesota declined during the study period for fewer than half of the age groups. Such strategies as risk factor surveillance, public health programs, and medical interventions need to be directed toward these groups that have not experienced the same declines in mortality rates as nearly all age groups of whites, both nationwide and in Minnesota, during the same period.\r"

Clinical investigations have implicated opsonizing antibody specific for the mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP) surrounding these bacteria as a potential immunologic protective mechanism, whereas nonopsonizing antibody to MEP is not protective. Mice and rats immunized with doses of MEP that elicited opsonizing antibody had reduced levels of infection compared with nonimmune controls after intratracheal challenge with mucoid P. aeruginosa enmeshed in agar beads. Doses of MEP that elicited nonopsonizing antibody were not protective. Parallel experiments in which passive transfer of polyclonal and monoclonal opsonizing and nonopsonizing antibody were used yielded similar results. These data indicate that MEP-specific opsonizing antibody can protect against chronic P. aeruginosa infection in this model of disease.\r"

An essential virulence determinant of Yersinia was shown to be a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The recombinant 50-kilodalton Yersinia phosphatase had a specificity for removal of phosphate from Tyr-containing as opposed to Ser/Thr-containing phosphopeptides and proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the Yersinia phosphatase possesses an essential Cys residue required for catalysis. Amino acids surrounding an essential Cys residue are highly conserved, as are other amino acids in the Yersinia and mammalian protein tyrosine phosphatases, suggesting that they use a common catalytic mechanism.\r"

These mutations, which activate alpha s by inhibiting its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, are found in codons for either of two amino acids, each of which is completely conserved in all known G protein alpha chains. The likelihood that similar mutations would activate other G proteins prompted a survey of human tumors for mutations that replace either of these two amino acids in other G protein alpha chain genes. The first gene so far tested, which encodes the alpha chain of Gi2, showed mutations that replaced arginine-179 with either cysteine or histidine in 3 of 11 tumors of the adrenal cortex and 3 of 10 endocrine tumors of the ovary. The mutant alpha i2 gene is a putative oncogene, referred to as gip2. In addition, gsp mutations were found in 18 of 42 GH-secreting pituitary tumors and in an autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma. These findings suggest that human tumors may harbor oncogenic mutations in various G protein alpha chain genes.\r"

To delineate alpha chain regulatory regions responsible for control of phospholipase A2, chimeric cDNAs were constructed in which different lengths of the alpha subunit of Gs (alpha s) were replaced with the corresponding sequence of the Gi alpha subunit (alpha i2). When a carboxyl-terminal chimera alpha s-i(38), which has the last 38 amino acids of alpha s substituted with the last 36 residues of alpha i2, was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the receptor-stimulated phospholipase A2 activity was inhibited, although the chimera could still activate adenylyl cyclase. Thus, alpha s-i(38) is an active alpha s, but also a dominant negative alpha i molecule, indicating that the last 36 amino acids of alpha i2 are a critical domain for G protein regulation of phospholipase A2 activity.\r"

Second, Pseudomonas meningitis can recur in a patient with AIDS after a month of appropriate therapy. Finally, imipenem is a poor choice for Pseudomonas meningitis, even when alternative therapies appear much less attractive. High doses of imipenem should not be used for fear of seizures, and lower doses only produce resistant organisms in the CSF.\r"

Bacterial translocation did not occur in the rats that were fed normally, but did occur in 60% of the rats fed the IV-TPN or the ORAL-TPN diets for 7 days (p less than 0.05). Since both the IV-TPN and ORAL-TPN diets induced bacterial translocation and the TPN solution (28% glucose and 4.5% amino acids) lacks fiber, two additional groups of rats were fed orally 2.5 gm cellulose powder/day plus TPN solution by either the intravenous or the oral route. The addition of cellulose powder decreased the incidence of bacterial translocation to 8% in the group fed the ORAL-TPN diet and to 0% in the group fed the IV-TPN diet. Cellulose improved intestinal barrier function, even though it did not prevent bacterial overgrowth or the loss of mucosal mass in the rats fed the IV-TPN or ORAL-TPN diets. Cellulose powder appears to have prevented bacterial translocation primarily by preventing IV-TPN- or ORAL-TPN-induced alterations in mucosal structure. Thus the oral administration of this fiber maintains intestinal barrier function and prevents bacterial translocation even in the absence of oral nutrients.\r"

Corticotropin-releasing hormone, (CRH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and products of the cyclooxygenase pathway have been proposed as possible mediators of the pituitary-adrenal response. We studied the relationship between the induction of these mediators and the onset of the neuroendocrine response in healthy male volunteers receiving one of two standard provocative stimuli: (1) Escherichia coli endotoxin (4 ng/kg intravenously) and (2) hypoglycemia induced by insulin (0.15 units/kg intravenously). Additional subjects receiving these stimuli were pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen, 1600 mg orally. Serial measurements were made of circulating concentrations of CRH, AVP, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and catecholamines. A sudden rise in circulating AVP (but not CRH) concentrations preceded the onset of all other responses after both stimuli. The prevention of this surge of AVP after endotoxin by ibuprofen was associated with blockade of the neuroendocrine response. These data demonstrate that two independent pathways are available for stimulation of the stress response. After both stimuli, peripheral AVP (but not CRH) levels may mirror alterations that occur within the central nervous system.\r"

Neither sham feeding nor gastric distention alters this meal-induced jejunal absorption, implying no role for the cephalic or gastric phases of digestion. This study tested the hypothesis that the small bowel is the origin of the proabsorptive signal for meal-induced jejunal absorption. Twenty-five-centimeter canine proximal jejunal Thiry-Vella fistulas were constructed, and chronic duodenal catheters were placed. Jejunal absorption studies (n = 72) were performed by luminal perfusion of the jejunal segments with an isotonic buffer containing radioactive carbon-labeled polyethylene glycol. Each study consisted of a 1-hour basal period followed by a 3-hour experimental period. Ten groups were studied: control, orally ingested mixed meal, and 600 ml duodenal infusions of either water, saline solution, protein, lipid, carbohydrate, 150 mmol/L mannitol, 300 mmol/L mannitol, or 600 mmol/L mannitol, each delivered at 10 ml/min over 60 minutes. The control, water, and saline solution groups showed no significant changes in integrated 3-hour jejunal absorption above basal. The ingested mixed meal significantly increased water and electrolyte absorption (p less than 0.0001). The isovolumetric, isocaloric duodenal nutrient infusions of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate all significantly increased jejunal water and electrolyte absorption (p less than 0.0001). The poorly absorbed solute mannitol significantly increased absorption (p less than 0.0001) in a dose-dependent fashion. These results indicate that the proabsorptive signal for meal-induced jejunal absorption originates from or distal to the duodenum. This newly defined enteroenteric response occurs independently of nutrient composition and responds to increasing osmolarity of poorly absorbed solutes such as mannitol.\r"

This study demonstrated that protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) inhibited the generation of an antitumor response to IL-2. A/J mice received an isocaloric diet of 2.5% or 24% casein 8 weeks before inoculation with C1300 neuroblastoma cells. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte generation and natural killer cell cytotoxicity. PCM produced a significant reduction in total body weight (p less than 0.001) and serum albumin concentration (p less than 0.001). PCM inhibited generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (p less than 0.001), T-lymphocyte response in mixed lymphocyte reaction (p less than 0.001), and in vitro activation of natural killer cell cytotoxicity with IL-2 (p less than 0.001). A second experiment was performed to evaluate whether the in vitro deficits in tumor-specific and natural immunity in the animal model of PCM would diminish the efficacy of systemic high-dose IL-2 (3 x 10(6) units/kg three times daily for 5 days). The mean percent inhibition of C1300 growth with IL-2 was only 15% in mice with PCM compared with 60% in well-nourished mice (p less than 0.01). Median host survival time was greater in well-nourished animals (55 days) compared with animals with PCM (39 days) that received IL-2 (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that nutritional status is a critically important variable in tumoricidal response to systemic IL-2.\r"

The measurements were repeated after a six week run in period and after a further three months in which those in the training group underwent an indoor training programme. The measurements made at three months were compared with those at the end of the run in period. There was no significant change in anthropometric characteristics, blood lipid profiles, or the provocative concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (histamine PC20) in the group who underwent training. After training there were significant increases in mean maximal oxygen uptake (ml kg-1 min-1) from 23 (5) to 28 (6), oxygen pulse (ml/beat) from 8.8 (2.3) to 10.8 (2.4), and anaerobic threshold (1/min) from 1.11 (0.27) to 1.38 (0.33). These changes were significantly greater in the group undergoing training than in the control group. There was also a significant fall in breathlessness scores (Borg ratings), blood lactate, carbon dioxide output, and minute ventilation during submaximal exercise in the training group, with no change in the control group. The subject's motivation, the initial level of fitness, and the symptom score at the time of training were the most important factors influencing improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. Thus submaximal physical exercise of controlled intensity, sustained for three months, produced significant improvements in fitness and cardiorespiratory performance that should be advantageous to the exercising asthmatic patient. The availability of medical supervision throughout the exercise programme appears to have contributed to the successful outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the results and outcome of different management approaches for acute myocardial infarction, we analyzed our experience with early (i.e., within 6 hours of infarct onset) direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (group A) versus initial treatment with thrombolytic therapy (group B) followed by angioplasty. From 1982 to 1989 a total of 214 patients underwent primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. During this time 157 patients underwent initial thrombolytic therapy, 104 with intravenous streptokinase and 53 with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by angioplasty. Other than age (group A, 61.7 +/- 11.5 years; group B, 57.3 +/- 11.6 years; p = 0.0002), the clinical characteristics of the groups were similar. In group A, 197 (92.1%) had successful results, and 17 (7.9%) were failures. Of the group treated with thrombolytic therapy, there was an overall 81.5% patency rate for patients treated with streptokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator with no significant difference between the agents. Angioplasty success after thrombolytic therapy was 94.3%. In-hospital and 1-year survival was significantly better in group B patients (95.5% and 95.5%, respectively) than in group A patients (92.1% and 89.3%, respectively). We conclude that both direct angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy followed by angioplasty provide high recanalization rates but that short- and long-term survival is improved when thrombolytic therapy precedes angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction patients.\r"

In 210 lesions in patients with MI who did not receive fibrinolysis during the MI (group A), 58 lesions were categorized as primary failures; bailout fibrinolysis brought the final failure incidence to 42 lesions (20%). In 97 lesions in patients with MI who received fibrinolysis during the acute MI (group B), 22 lesions were categorized as primary failures; bailout fibrinolysis resulted in final failures of 16 lesions (16.5%). In 591 lesions in patients without a recent MI (group C), there were 85 primary failures and 81 final failures after bailout fibrinolysis. Analysis of the PTCA results in each group with respect to whether the lesions were totally or partially occluded showed that more of the lesions attempted in the groups with MI (groups A and B) were totally occluded (TO) and that with use of bailout fibrinolysis the success rate of PTCA in TO lesions was the same in all groups. Similarly, with use of fibinolytic bailout during PTCA the success rate in partially occlusive lesions was not different between the groups. We conclude that bailout thrombolysis during PTCA is usually effective, especially in those who have recently had an MI, and that with availability of bailout fibrinolysis, PTCA in those with recent MI is not any less sucessful than in those without recent MI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nitroglycerin (NTG) has the potential to reduce myocardial ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Buccal administration of NTG offers practical advantages compared to intravenous or intracoronary administration. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 100 patients were given 5 mg of buccal NTG or placebo during PTCA. A scoring system for ischemic pain during balloon inflation was defined as pain intensity (0 to 5) multiplied by duration of pain after balloon deflation (1 = 0 to 30 seconds, 2 = 30 to 60 seconds, 3 = 60 to 120 seconds, 4 = greater than 120 seconds but subsiding, and 5 = until next inflation). Fourteen patients were excluded: 12 for vagal reaction (eight NTG and four placebo; p greater than 0.05) requiring atropine, making buccal absorption unreliable, and two for inability to dilate. Eighteen patients (nine NTG and nine placebo) had no pain during balloon inflation. Sixty-eight patients (32 NTG and 36 placebo) had ischemic pain with a pain score (mean +/- SD) of 4.8 +/- 3.8 for the NTG group versus 7.1 +/- 4.8 for the placebo group (p = 0.03). We conclude that buccal NTG significantly decreases myocardial ischemia during PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "An intracoronary drug infusion protocol was employed to assess the hemodynamic effects of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and to evaluate its actions on epicardial coronary artery dimensions. Increasing concentrations of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide (1.75 to 84 micrograms/min) were infused at a constant rate directly into the left coronary artery in eight patients with normal left ventricular function and left coronary artery angiograms. Steady-state hemodynamic parameters and high-fidelity left ventricular pressure were recorded at each dose and indexes of left ventricular contractile and diastolic function were calculated. Coronary angiograms obtained at baseline and the highest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide were compared by quantitative image analysis techniques. At the highest dose administered, atrial natriuretic peptide decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure (-36%, p less than 0.01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-80%, p less than 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (-58%, p less than 0.01), left ventricular end-systolic pressure (-11%, p less than 0.01), mean arterial pressure (-8%, p less than 0.05), and pulmonary vascular resistance (-18%, p less than 0.05). Cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were unchanged, and heart rate and peak positive dP/dt increased. Peak negative dP/dt and the time constant of early diastolic relaxation calculated by the logarithmic method both fell at the highest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide, although the time constants calculated by other less load-sensitive methods were unchanged. Doses of intracoronary atrial peptide that did not alter left ventricular load had no effect on indexes of left ventricular systolic or diastolic function despite a presumably high intramyocardial concentration of the agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90342762\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of serum thyroglobulin concentration in patients with Graves' disease and to establish the clinical usefulness of this measurement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum thyroglobulin concentration was analyzed in relation to serum thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRab) titer and thyrotropin concentration in 166 patients with Graves' disease without thyroglobulin antibody. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were treated and had been kept euthyroid for at least 10 months with methimazole and underwent a triiodothyronine (T3) suppression test. At the time of the T3 suppression test, the serum thyroglobulin concentration (ng/mL) was 33 +/- 31 in 80 of them with T3-suppressible (radioiodine uptake less than 12%) thyroids, negative TRab titers (less than 15% displacement), and normal serum thyrotropin concentrations (0.1 to 3.0 mU/L). Patients with T3-non-suppressible thyroids were divided into three subgroups according to serum TRab titers and thyrotropin concentrations: those with a negative TRab titer and a normal serum thyrotropin concentration (n = 9), those with a positive TRab titer and a normal thyrotropin concentration (n = 18), and those with a positive TRab titer and undetectable thyrotropin (n = 6). Serum thyroglobulin concentrations (ng/mL) were 116 +/- 40 in the first group, 249 +/- 194 in the second group, and 399 +/- 205 in the third group. In the other 39 methimazole-treated patients, 72 determinations of serum thyroglobulin concentration were performed either before or during treatment without the T3 suppression test, and it correlated well with the TRab titer but not with the serum thyrotropin concentration. In 14 patients who became hypothyroid due to excess methimazole, the serum thyroglobulin concentration increased concurrently with elevation of the serum thyrotropin concentration and normalized during thyroxine supplementation. In treated patients with T3-suppressible thyroids, the serum thyroglobulin concentration was similar among those with positive (n = 54) and negative (n = 26) microsomal antibody, indicating that the presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis does not profoundly affect the serum thyroglobulin level. Among 80 patients with T3-suppressible thyroids who were followed without methimazole for a mean period of 31.1 months, eight (10%) experienced a clinically overt recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Serum thyroglobulin concentration and TRab titer (%) in these eight patients were 188.1 +/- 101.7 and 27.8 +/- 12.6, respectively. Thyroglobulin and TRab did not increase in the patients who remained euthyroid (n = 71) or who experienced subclinical recurrence (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal thyroid stimulator(s) and thyrotropin synergistically (if both are present in the serum) or independently (if either one is present) stimulate thyroglobulin secretion in patients with Graves' disease. Therefore, serum thyroglobulin concentration can be a useful means of assessing the degree of thyroidal stimulation and, if serum thyrotropin is normal or suppressed, correlates well with thyroidal stimulation even in patients with a negative TRab titer.\r"

  ".W": "A natural cerebroside (antiC) IgM antibody was found at relatively high levels in the serum of every healthy individual studied. The reactivity of the antibody was assessed by using highly purified bovine brain galactocerebroside (galC) or human glucocerebroside (gluC) as antigen. The importance of fatty acid moiety of galC in antigen-antibody reaction was demonstrated by low immunoreactivity using 1-beta-D-galactosyl sphingosine (GS) as antigen and by the absence of absorption to GS-bearing liposomes. The presence of alpha-hydroxy and non-hydroxy fatty acids in galC did not modify its immunoreactivity. Cerebroside antibody binding activity was only partially blocked by 0.5 M galactose or alpha- and beta-methylgalactopyranoside, suggesting poor specificity of antiC for a specific glycosidic residue or linkage. In fact, liposome-bearing gluC absorbed galC. AntiC did not adsorb on rabbit, guinea pig, or human erythrocytes (RBC), but absorbed strongly on rat RBC. Elevated antibody levels were found in 57% of Kala azar patients, 56% of Trypanosoma rangeli-infected patients, 30% of chronic chagasic patients, and 20% of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, but were not found in 16 other inflammatory or infectious diseases studied. This suggests an association between Kinetoplastida infection and elevated levels of antiC, with parasitic galC acting probably as a highly immunogenic antigen. A possible role of anti-galC in the neuropathological symptoms of Chagas' disease and in the control of parasitemia levels in T. rangeli-infected individuals is discussed.\r"

Studies of the histology of the liver have shown only minor alterations, seemingly insufficient to account for death. Pichinde virus is an arenavirus which causes severe illness similar to Lassa fever in strain 13 guinea pigs, but does not cause severe illness in man. This can serve as a relatively safe model for studying the pathology and pathophysiology of fatal arenaviral infection. We used this infection to evaluate the effect of arenavirus on liver morphology and function. When guinea pigs were infected with Pichinde virus, all developed severe disease and died within 14 days of infection. The animals lost large amounts of weight. Higher levels of virus were detected in the liver than in serum. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated late in the course of the disease; no elevations were seen in gamma glutamyl transpeptidase or bilirubin. Alkaline phosphatase, initially high in these growing animals, was markedly decreased early in infection. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were increased late in the disease, and decreased levels of Factors VIII and IX were seen relatively early. Fatty metamorphosis, indicating problems in lipid processing, occurred by day 11, but necrosis was minor and occurred late. Pichinde virus infection results in significant alterations in the metabolic and synthetic capacities of the hepatocytes early in infection in the absence of significant necrosis.\r"

We investigated the effects of this on eicosanoids (thromboxane B2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and leukotriene B4), white blood cell activation, and skeletal muscle injury as quantitated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride and technetium-99m pyrophosphate after ischemia-reperfusion injury in an isolated gracilis muscle model in 16 anesthetized dogs. One gracilis muscle in each dog was subjected to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 1 hour of limited reperfusion and then by a second hour of normal reperfusion. The other muscle was subjected to 6 hours of ischemia followed by 2 hours of normal reperfusion. Six dogs each were used as normal reperfusion controls (NR) and limited reperfusion controls (LR), with 5 dogs being treated with a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (LR/TSI) and another five with a leukotriene inhibitor (LR/LI). LR in all three groups (LR, LR/TSI, and LR/LI) showed a benefit in skeletal muscle injury as measured by triphenyltetrazolim chloride and technetium-99m pyrophosphate when compared with NR. However, there was no significant difference between the groups with LR regarding eicosanoid levels and white blood cell activation when compared with NR. These results demonstrate that LR produces benefits by mechanisms other than those dependent upon thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, or white blood cell activation.\r"

This technique provides values for global blood flow and for gray and white matter blood flow, and from 13 preselected regions in one hemisphere. After the administration of sufentanil, the volunteers were stimulated verbally in order to prevent their loss of consciousness and hypercarbia. Heart rate (HR), arterial pressure, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2 were recorded during the measurements. Neither global CBF (46.1 +/- 1.6 control and 43 +/- 1.9 after sufentanil, mean +/- SEM) nor gray (76.5 +/- 3.2 and 70.9 +/- 6.1) or white (22.7 +/- 1.5 and 24.2 +/- 1.6) matter blood flow changed significantly after sufentanil administration. As well, no significant differences in HR (72 +/- 4 control and 79 +/- 4 beats per min after sufentanil) and ETCO2 (39.8 +/- 1.4 and 41.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg) were observed.

Male mongrel dogs (n = 16) were anesthetized with enflurane in oxygen. Tracheal intubation was performed, monitors placed, and end-tidal enflurane concentration measured via a Puritan-Bennett Anesthesia Agent Monitor. MAC was determined by the tail-clamp method. CPB was then initiated using aortoatrial (n = 6, group 1) or femoral artery-vein (n = 4, group 2) cannulation or none (n = 6, group 3, control). CPB was maintained for 1 h using a bubble oxygenator, a crystalloid prime, and flows of approximately 70-80 ml/kg with a mean systemic pressure maintained between 50-70 mmHg. Following separation from CPB, MAC was again determined. The reduction in enflurane MAC following CPB was 30.1 +/- 21.5% (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05 vs. pre-CPB) in group 1 but there was a wide range of reduction produced (3.8-58.8%). The degree of MAC reduction (19.8 +/- 8.6%; P less than 0.05 vs. pre-CPB) produced by CPB in group 2 was much less variable in degree (range 13.0-32.4%) but did not differ from group 1. Although pre- versus post-CPB mean systemic pressure fell from 83 +/- 13 to 69 +/- 15 mmHg (P less than 0.05), this is above the level likely to produce a reduction in MAC. No other significant hemodynamic changes were observed. Temperature pre- versus post-CPB was not different. The degree of hemodilution and acid-base disturbances are unlikely to be the explanation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over the range of CI studied (1 to 5 l.min-1.m-2), hypoxia increased PAP in 22 dogs (responders) and did not affect PAP in 16 other dogs (nonresponders). In eight nonresponders, two repetitions of alternated 0.4 and 0.1 FIO2 exposures did not restore hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), defined as a hypoxia-induced increase in PAP at a given flow. Intravenous infusion of 2 M HCl (2 mmol.kg-1.h-1) decreased arterial pH from normal to around 7.20 in eight responders and eight nonresponders. This metabolic acidosis increased PAP at all levels of CI in hyperoxia and in hypoxia in all the dogs, enhanced HPV in the responders, and restored HPV in the nonresponders. In eight responders, 2 M HCl infusion (2 mmol.kg-1.h-1) together with a 7% sodium bicarbonate infusion (adjusted to maintain arterial pH unchanged) did not affect hyperoxic or hypoxic PAP/CI plots. Pretreatment with 1 g acetylsalicylic acid iv (6 dogs) did not affect the pulmonary vasoreactivity to HCl-induced (2 M HCl, 2 mmol.kg-1.h-1) metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that in intact dogs: 1) metabolic acidosis enhances HPV; 2) at the given dose, HCl does not produce pulmonary vascular effects unrelated to the circulating blood pH; and 3) it is unlikely that the pulmonary vasoreactivity to metabolic acidosis is mediated by products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The authors compared PaCO2 with end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) sampled at multiple sites along the endotracheal tube (ETT) in seven anesthetized rabbits (weight, 2.7-3.6 kg) to determine the most convenient, yet accurate, sampling location. Comparisons were made during spontaneous and controlled ventilation with fresh gas flows (FGF) of two and ten times the minute ventilation using a Mapleson D circuit. An Engstrom Eliza analyzer with a continuous sampling rate of 100 ml/min was used to measure ETCO2. A 0.75-mm ID polyethylene tube inserted in the side of the ETT sampled ETCO2 at the distal tip and at the 6-, 12-, and 15-cm marks on the ETT. ETCO2 was also measured at the standard proximal connector. The differences (P less than 0.05) between PaCO2 and ETCO2 at the distal, 6-, 12-, and 15-cm marks were 2.9 +/- 0.4, 3.1 +/- 0.4, 3.6 +/- 0.4, and 4.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM), respectively, and did not change with FGF or mode of ventilation. The difference between PaCO2 and ETCO2 measured at the proximal connector was always large but significantly (P less than 0.05) greater during spontaneous than controlled ventilation (24.2 +/- 1.5 versus 15.0 +/- 1.4 mmHg) and at higher FGF (19.4 +/- 1.3 versus 16.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg). The differences (P less than 0.05) between ETCO2 at the distal tip and ETCO2 at the 6-, 12-, and 15-cm marks were 0.24 +/- 0.07, 0.73 +/- 0.11, and, 1.77 +/- 0.20 mmHg, respectively. This demonstrates that the change in ETCO2 between the distal tip and the 12-cm mark on the ETT is less than 1 mmHg, and that this clinically insignificant difference is independent of FGF and mode of ventilation. The 12 cm-mark is outside of the mouth on a newborn, and sampling ETCO2 at that point, which may be accomplished simply by inserting a small needle in the side of the ETT, may be the most appropriate sampling location.\r"

The effects of a benzodiazepine antagonist and a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist on the analgesic effects of equivalent doses of midazolam, fentanyl, and ketocyclazocine were studied. These were the minimum doses producing maximal segmental analgesia when given intrathecally (i.e., they all caused a significant and maximum increase in ECTP in the tail, which was similar for all three drugs, but no significant change in the ECTP in the neck). Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) administration caused a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve for midazolam spinal analgesia. Segmental analgesia following midazolam was also significantly attenuated (P less than 0.05) when the selective GABA antagonist bicuculline was given intrathecally at the same time as midazolam. The highest dose of bicuculline used (50 pmol) caused no significant attenuation of the segmental analgesic effects of either ketocyclazocine or fentanyl. The authors concluded that the segmental analgesia produced by intrathecal midazolam is mediated by the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex that is involved in other benzodiazepine actions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of transient hyperglycemia on brain glucose and the relationship between blood and brain glucose were studied in 76 Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with halothane 1% inspired. In a common control group, blood and brain glucose were determined prior to any intervention (n = 10). A second group of 30 rats was given an iv infusion of 3.9 ml of saline over a 30-min period, and blood and brain glucose were subsequently determined at several time points: 30 min (immediately after the saline infusion), 45, 60, 90, or 120 min (n = 6 for each time point). A third group of 36 rats was administered 3 g/kg of glucose in 3.9 ml of iv saline over a similar 30-min period, and blood and brain glucose were measured at the same time periods as in saline-treated rats and also when half of the glucose infusion was given (time = 15 min; n = 6 for each time point). In the common control group, blood glucose was 114 +/- 14 mg/dl (6.4 +/- 0.8 mumol/ml; mean +/- SD) and brain glucose was 2.41 +/- 0.59 mumol/g. Saline infusion had no effect on brain or blood glucose. In contrast, glucose infusion in the study group produced significant increases in both blood and brain glucose, achieving maximal values of 488 +/- 60 mg/dl (27.4 +/- 3.4 mumol/ml) and 7.62 +/- 0.52 mumol/g, respectively, at the 30-min measurement period. The ratio of brain to blood glucose, normalized so that the common control group data achieved a value of 1, was less than unity during the period of glucose infusion. This ratio reached a nadir of 0.75 +/- 0.07 at the 30-min measurement period (P less than 0.05 versus saline infusion). Thereafter, with the cessation of glucose infusion, the ratio returned to 1 and eventually exceeded unity: the peak ratios were 1.23 +/- 0.13 and 1.16 +/- 0.21 at the 60- and 90-min period, respectively (P less than 0.05 versus saline treatment). The authors concluded that during periods of rapidly fluctuating blood glucose, there is a hysteresis between blood and brain glucose values; hence, it may not be possible to accurately estimate brain glucose by measuring blood glucose.\r"

  ".W": "Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and potent agonist at alpha-2 adrenoceptors, produces a hypnotic-anesthetic action in rats. The mechanism for this response may involve an inhibitory G-protein and increased conductance through a potassium channel. To investigate this, the effects of pertussis toxin, a specific inactivator of inhibitory G-proteins, and 4-aminopyridine, a blocker of potassium channels, on the hypnotic-anesthetic response to dexmedetomidine were studied in rats. Pertussis toxin and 4-aminopyridine both decreased the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine in a dose-dependent fashion. To preclude the possibility that pertussis toxin and 4-aminopyridine attenuated the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine via indirect central nervous system excitation, the effects of pertussis toxin and 4-aminopyridine on the hypnotic-anesthetic action of pentobarbital also were assessed. Pentobarbital-induced hypnosis was not attenuated by either treatment. These results suggest that the receptor-effector mechanism for the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine involves an inhibitory G-protein and increased conductance through a potassium channel.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have demonstrated that neuropeptides are present in bronchial tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the influence of antihistamine in comparison to an anticholinergic drug on bronchospasm induced by inhalation of substance P (SP). Seven moderate asthmatic patients (mean age = 34.4 +/- 8.9), five being female, were studied. The acetate salt of SP was prepared in 0.9% saline to produce a dose range of 23 to 184 x 10(-6) mol. Patients were studied on three separate days with an interval of 3 weeks between challenges. On the first day the dose of SP producing a 20% change in FEV1 was calculated from the individual semilogarithmic dose-response curve. On subsequent days, in a randomized double-blind manner, the patients were treated either with astemizole (20 mg BID for three days) and placebo ipratropium bromide or with placebo of astemizole (twice a day for three days) and with pressurized aerosol of ipratropium bromide (IB) (40 micrograms 20 minutes before the challenge). Two way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. Our results demonstrated that inhaled SP is able to produce a dose-response curve of bronchoconstriction with a geometric mean of PD20 of 50.51 x 10(-6) moles (37.38 to 68.19 x 10(-6) mol). Treatment with astemizole induced a geometric mean PD20 of 65.51 x 10(-6) mol (33.02 to 130.21 x 10(-6) mol) and the premedication with the IB induced a significant (P less than .05) shift of dose-response curve to SP (geometric mean PD20 = 109.1 x 10(-6) mol; 58.67 to 204.05 x 10(-6) mol). Our results demonstrated that bronchoconstriction induced by SP could be attributed to a weak cholinergic activation and not to histamine release.\r"

Six patients were randomized to receive sufficient nasoenterically administered calories to provide a total caloric intake equal to 1,000 kcal above their usual intake. The other four patients were sham fed, receiving only 100 kcal more. Measurements of nutritional status, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, adductor pollicis function, and pulmonary function were performed initially and at study end. The refed group gained significantly more weight and showed significant increases in maximal expiratory pressure and mean sustained inspiratory pressure. There were no significant changes in the maximal inspiratory pressure or in adductor pollicis function. In malnourished inpatients with COPD, short-term refeeding leads to improvement in respiratory muscle endurance and in some parameters of respiratory muscle strength in the absence of demonstrable changes in peripheral muscle function.\r"

Therefore, we examined the effects of positive-pressure ventilation on two groups of open-chest dogs ventilated for 30 min with a peak Paw of 21.8 +/- 2.3 cm H2O (Low Paw) or 64.3 +/- 3.5 cm H2O (High Paw). No hemodynamic changes were observed in the Low Paw group during ventilation, but mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) increased by 9.9 cm H2O, peak inspiratory Ppa by 24.6 cm H2O, and estimated mean microvascular pressure by 12.5 cm H2O during High Paw ventilation. During the same period, lung lymph flow increased by 435% in the High Paw and 35% in the Low Paw groups, and the terminal extravascular lung water/blood-free dry weight ratios were 5.65 +/- 0.27 and 4.43 +/- 0.13 g/g, respectively, for the two groups. Lung lymph protein clearances and minimal lymph/plasma ratios of total protein were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) after 2 h of increased left atrial pressure (PLA) in the High Paw group versus the Low Paw group, which indicates a significant increase in microvascular permeability. Lymph prostacyclin concentration in pulmonary lymph, measured as the stable metabolite 6-0-PGF1 alpha, was increased significantly by 70 to 150% from baseline (p less than 0.05) in both groups during the periods of increased Paw and increased PLA, but it was not significantly different between the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 12 dogs, the left lungs were transplanted after they had been preserved for 24 hours at 4 degrees C after pulmonary artery flushing with modified Eurocollins solution. In 6 dogs, dimethylthiourea, a potent oxygen free radical scavenger, was added to the flush solution and was also given to the recipients just before reperfusion. In all animals, the contralateral pulmonary artery and bronchus were ligated and lung function was assessed for 12 hours or until death. Three dogs died prematurely in the control group, whereas only 1 dog died prematurely in the dimethylthiourea group. This resulted in a statistically significant difference in the average length of survival (p less than 0.05). Pulmonary artery and right atrial pressures were significantly lower in the dimethylthiourea group during the first 6 hours (p less than 0.05). Treatment with dimethylthiourea resulted in a significantly higher arterial oxygen tension at 4 hours, and intrapulmonary shunt tended to be lower. Thus, it would appear that dimethylthiourea has a protective effect on lungs preserved for 24 hours before transplantation in dogs.\r"

The strength of the associations was compared with that of the associations between traditional risk factors (eg, smoking status, cholesterol levels) and coronary artery disease. The study population consisted of 154 women (mean age, 62.9 years) and 348 men (mean age, 59.6 years). The apolipoprotein A-I concentration averaged (+/- SD) 124 +/- 25 mg/dL and the apolipoprotein B concentration, 98 +/- 24 mg/dL. In all cases, the apolipoprotein measures showed a larger univariate difference between the \"normal\" (no coronary artery disease) group (66 patients) and the group with coronary artery disease (436 patients) than did the corresponding standard lipoprotein measures. The variable with the strongest association with coronary artery disease was the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B, followed by apolipoprotein B level. These findings were confirmed using logistic regression, adjusting for other coronary artery disease risk factors. Fasting status did not affect apolipoprotein A-I or B concentrations. We conclude that the use of apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations gives additional information to that supplied by lipoprotein measures to help predict the presence of coronary artery disease. Since traditional lipid measures may be changed by a meal, apolipoproteins A-I and B might be more useful measures when the fasting status of a patient is in question.\r"

Both have been extensively studied and are believed to represent distinct metabolic entities that may confer differing protection against coronary artery disease risk. We have previously suggested that LpA-I might represent the antiatherogenic effect, which has been ascribed mainly to its effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; we set out to investigate, in 344 men, the relation between LpA-I:A-II and LpA-I levels and alcohol consumption. As the alcohol intake rose, LpA-I:A-II levels increased, while LpA-I levels fell. On the assumption that LpA-I is the antiatherogenic fraction of high-density lipoprotein, the putative protective action of alcohol consumption against coronary artery disease should be reconsidered.\r"

  ".U": "90343598\r", 
  ".W": "A patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and reduced levels of von Willebrand factor had severe recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment with either desmopressin acetate or cryoprecipitate normalized both bleeding time and kaolin-activated partial thromboplastin time. Hematochezia (five episodes) continued, however, for a week despite daily treatment with cryoprecipitate, whereas treatment with desmopressin at the onset of three later episodes of hematochezia resulted in the prompt cessation of bleeding. After an episode of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, desmopressin administration allowed a total colectomy without excessive bleeding. During the 3 years after colectomy, no further gastrointestinal bleeding occurred. In the past year, however, three episodes of severe epistaxis responded promptly to intravenous infusion of desmopressin. We conclude that desmopressin may be useful in the management of bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with or without von Willebrand factor deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "From 1985 through 1987, the authors assessed the relationship between two main variables at a large academic medical center: (1) the numbers (high or low) of patients per diagnosis-related group (DRG) treated by individual physicians and (2) hospital resource consumption of the patients. The patients were classified according to their routes of admission (emergency or non-emergency); the physicians with eight or more patients per DRG were labeled \"high-patient-load physicians\" (hereafter called \"high-load physicians\"), and those with five or fewer patients were labeled \"low-patient-load physicians,\" (\"low-load physicians\"). The resource variables studied were length of stay (LOS) and total hospital cost. For the non-emergency admissions, the low-load physicians' patients had an average LOS that was 56.2% greater and an average hospital cost that was 58.3% greater than were the LOS and cost of the patients of the high-load physicians. (Both LOS and cost per patient were adjusted for DRG weight index.) This was due in part to a greater severity of illness for the patients (as measured by total ICD-9-CM codes per patient) of the low-load physicians. For the emergency admissions, the low-load physicians' patients had an average LOS that was 9.5% greater and an average hospital cost that was 10.5% greater than the LOS and cost of the patients of the high-load physicians. As in the non-emergency admissions group, severity of illness for the patients of the low-load physicians was greater. The only category of patients that was economically profitable to the hospital was the non-emergency admissions group treated by the high-load physicians. Even though these findings were the result of many factors (discussed in the text), they suggest a relationship between hospital resource consumption and the physicians' patient load per DRG.\r"

The enzyme L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-AADC) that converts L-dopa to DA has been localized to the proximal tubule cells with immunocytochemistry. Locally formed DA will inhibit the activity of Na-K-ATPase, the enzyme that yields energy to active Na transport. The effect is of physiological importance during high salt diet. The phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a DA1 receptor associated third messenger is abundant in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle (mTAL). DARPP-32 is phosphorylated after activation of DA1 receptors. DARPP-32 is in its phosphorylated form a potent phosphatase inhibitor. Activation of the DA1 receptor in mTAL with the DA1 agonist SKF 82526 causes dose-dependent inhibition of Na-K-ATPase activity. The effect involves activation of cAMP protein kinase. It is likely that this effect is potentiated by DARPP-32.\r"

In inactin-anesthesized rats, L-dopa increased natriuresis, diuresis and renal blood flow; these effects were linked to endorenal DA synthesis and to DA-1 receptor stimulation since they were suppressed by both carbidopa and SCH 23390. In the isolated perfused rat kidney, DA was synthesized from L-dopa with a greater yield than from gludopa. In nonfiltering kidneys, L-dopa metabolism was not limited when the access to dopa decarboxylase was restricted to the basolateral membrane. The same was not true for gludopa, for which the basolateral metabolism was low.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported the presence of dopamine-1 (DA-1) and dopamine-2 (DA-2) receptors in renal brush border and basolateral membranes. DA-1 agonists stimulate adenylate cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) activity in both membranes. Moreover, the ability of a DA-1 agonist (fenoldopam) to stimulate PLC activity is independent of AC activity. A DA-2 agonist (LY171555) by itself was without effect and did not enhance the ability of the DA-1 agonist to stimulate PLC activity. The DA-1 but not DA-2 agonists inhibit Na+/H+ exchange activity in brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) and Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity in basolateral membranes. However, cAMP inhibits, while protein kinase C (presumably via PLC activity) stimulates, Na+/H+ exchange activity. We therefore determined the effect of DA-1 agonists on Na+/H+ exchange activity when PLC or AC activity was blocked using neomycin or dideoxyadenosine, respectively. The drugs were incubated with minced renal cortex prior to preparation of BBMV by differential centrifugation and MnCl2 precipitation. Enrichment of BBMV was not affected by drug treatment. The Na+/H+ exchange activity was assessed by measuring amiloride (1 mmol/L) sensitive 22Na+ uptake in BBMV (pHi = 5.5, pHo = 7.5, Nai+ = O, Nao+ = 1 mmol/L). Neomycin inhibited DA and DA-1-stimulated PLC activity in BBMV in a concentration dependent manner (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L). Neomycin (10(-4) mol/L) completely blocked the ability of DA and DA-1 agonist to stimulate PLC activity but had no consistent effect on DA-1 inhibited Na+/H+ exchange activity. Dideoxyadenosine inhibited DA and DA-1 simulated AC activity without affecting DA-1 stimulated PLC activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The short term regulation of the activity of the Na,K-pump (Na+,K(+)-ATPase) is just beginning to be understood. By using single microdissected proximal tubule segments (PCT) (permeabilized in order to clamp Na entry), it was possible to study regulation of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in its own environment and in a well defined cell population. The Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity can be regulated over a short term via guanidine triphosphate (GTP) dependent regulatory proteins. However the guanidine proteins are not directly coupled to the Na,K-pump and the mechanism involves the activation of complex intracellular signalling system. Locally produced dopamine induces a dose dependent inhibition of Na+,K+ ATPase activity. This inhibition is mediated by a complex mechanism that requires the activation of both membrane dopamine receptors, DA-1 and DA-2. It involves the activation of a pertussis toxin sensitive GTP-binding protein and activation of protein kinase C. A DA-2 agonist only inhibits Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity when it is incubated together with dibutyryl cAMP or Forskolin. We have therefore concluded that an increase in cellular cAMP levels plays a permissive role for DA-2 inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. A fully differentiated cell is required for dopamine inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. An abnormal regulation of proximal tubule Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity might be of importance in the pathogenesis of certain types of hypertension.\r"

While there have been many studies of possible interactions, use of poorly selective receptor antagonists, inappropriate doses, different animal species and various forms of ANP has led to confusing and conflicting results. Our review of the data concludes that it is unlikely that either dopamine generation or release, or DA receptor activation (with the possible exception of its involvement in the rat), are essential to the expression of the effects of ANP. DA actions do not depend on the release of ANP while there are no studies of DA activating ANP receptors.\r"

Raising the sodium chloride concentration in the incubation medium increases DA formation and reduces DOPAC accumulation. The addition of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP; 3.3 and 330 nmol/L) to the incubation medium decreases DA formation; this effect was potentiated by the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor M&B 22,948 and antagonized by a raise in the sodium chloride concentration to 157 mmol/L.\r"

The labeling method used the abundant carbohydrate groups on Ep and resulted in biologically active biotin-Ep (b-Ep) containing 8 to 10 biotins per Ep molecule. Specific binding of b-Ep to cells from spleens of mice made anemic by phenylhydrazine injections was demonstrated using 125I-labeled streptavidin. B-Ep, together with fluorescently tagged streptavidin, was found to specifically detect Ep-receptor-bearing cells by flow cytometry. This was demonstrated in several ways. First, approximately 90% of nucleated spleen cells from phenylhydrazine-treated mice were clearly fluorescent after staining with b-Ep and streptavidin-phycoerythrin, whereas only background fluorescence was detected using spleen cells from untreated mice. In addition, Ep-receptors were detected on 5% to 10% of normal mouse bone marrow cells, and these cells could be identified as erythroid in nature by separating the cells into subpopulations based on light-scatter properties. Third, Ep-receptor expression was found to correlate positively with expression of transferrin receptors, confirming the erythroid nature of these cells. B-Ep was also used to isolate Ep-receptors from monkey COS cells transfected with the murine Ep-receptor cDNA. In these experiments a cell-surface-bound protein of approximately 65 Kd and an intracellular protein of approximately 60 Kd were isolated from these cells. The procedures described in this report for detecting Ep-receptor expressing cells and for isolating the Ep-receptor should be valuable for purifying erythroid cells from heterogeneous cell populations, for elucidating the structure of the Ep-receptor, and for studying the biological activities of Ep at the cellular and molecular level.\r"

To better understand this process, we have used several approaches to identify which G proteins are present in platelets, normal human megakaryocytes, and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a leukemic cell line with megakaryocytic features. Because platelet and HEL cell responses to thrombin are inhibited by pertussis toxin, we have focused upon the members of the Gi family, whose alpha subunits can be ADP-ribosylated by that toxin. Western blots with antisera specific for Gi alpha demonstrated the presence in both platelets and HEL cells of the three best-described forms of this protein: Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, and Gi alpha 3. Based upon immunoprecipitation studies with [35S]-methionine-labeled HEL cells, their relative abundance appears to be Gi alpha 2 much greater than Gi alpha 3 greater than Gi alpha 1. A HEL cell cDNA library screened with the Gi alpha antisera produced clones encoding Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 that had sequences similar to those reported from other sources. Gi alpha-specific probes created from these cDNA clones confirmed the presence of mRNA encoding Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 in both platelets (by Northern blotting) and megakaryocytes (by in situ hybridization). Thus the pertussis toxin substrates that have previously been detected in platelets and HEL cells are shown to be members of the Gi alpha family, all of which are candidates for interaction with receptors for thrombin and other agonists.\r"

Active site labeling and inactivation of proteases is attained by modification of the active site histidine with a peptidyl chloromethylketone. In the specific illustrations demonstrated, we used the compound biotinyl-epsilon-aminocaproyl-phenylalanylprolylarginyl chloromethylketone. This reagent reacts quantitatively and specifically with the active site histidine of a wide variety of proteases that are elaborated in the coagulation and fibrinolytic system. The inactivated enzyme(s) may be quantitated by combinations of antiprotein antibodies and avidin binding technology using the biotin moiety on the peptide inhibitor. We have demonstrated the capability of capture of inactivated enzyme products directly on to solid-phase avidin with subsequent quantitation of bound protein using specific antibodies. In the converse system we have captured specific proteases using antiprotein antibodies in the solid phase and have quantitated bound enzyme by using avidin. Subsequent detection and quantitation has been achieved using the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase conjugated either to the antibody or to avidin. Both types of assays are feasible, with avidin capture being the preferred mode when enzyme is evaluated in the presence of excess zymogen, as would be common in the evaluation of most blood-clotting enzymes. Assays are illustrated for tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin, thrombin, factor Xa, and activated protein C, which can measure protease concentrations as low as 50 pmol/L. Specific applications of the assays are provided in studies of the activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex and of factor X with Russell's viper venom factor X activator. These assays measure the mass of active site present in the reaction mixture and are relatively independent of subspecies of enzyme or the environment in which the activity is generated. These assay systems provide powerful tools for elucidating product-precursor relationships in multienzyme feedback reactions involving zymogen activation.\r"

  ".W": "Renal failure complicating obstructive jaundice (OJ) is probably linked to reduction of the extracellular water compartment. To elucidate the mechanism by which OJ leads to isotonic water depletion we studied a group of rabbits with OJ after common bile duct ligation (n = 17) and another group of sham operated rabbits (n = 14) for 10 days. Water intake and balance for two study periods (1-4 and 7-10 days after operation) were calculated. Renal function, sodium balance and plasma atrial natriuretic factor were determined on the fourth and tenth days after operation. Water intake and balance were lower in the OJ group both in the first study period (230 versus 519 ml/days 1-4, P less than 0.001; and -2.4 versus 219 ml/days 1-4, P less than 0.0001 respectively) and in the second study period (260 versus 865 ml/days 7-10, P less than 0.0001; and 11 versus 379 ml/days 7-10, P less than 0.0001 respectively). Sodium intake was negligible in the OJ group both on day four (0.73 versus 7.15 mM/24 h, P less than 0.0001) and on day 10 (0.78 versus 15.78 mM/24 h, P less than 0.0001). As a result plasma osmolality did not change. Day 10 urine osmolality and osmolar clearance were reduced in the OJ group (653 versus 1103 mOsm/kg, P less than 0.0001 and 0.09 versus 0.25 ml/min, P less than 0.0001 respectively) together with a decreased creatinine clearance (3 versus 11 ml/min, P less than 0.0001). Atrial natriuretic factor was increased in jaundiced rabbits (day 4, 22.7 versus 7.5 fmol/ml, P less than 0.0001; and day 10, 26.5 versus 11.2 fmol/ml, P less than 0.02). These findings suggest that OJ leads to an isotonic volume depletion resulting from abnormalities of the extracellular volume regulating mechanisms. These appear to be secondary to an inappropriate elevation of the atrial natriuretic factor plasma concentration.\r"

  ".U": "90345181\r", 
  ".W": "We have performed a series of isotopic studies in 25 adult patients with sepsis and/or trauma in order to determine the metabolic effects of recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) administration. Twelve of the patients were receiving total parenteral nutrition, and 13 were eating a normal ward diet and were studied postabsorption. Energy and protein kinetics were quantified isotopically before rHGH administration and following a 3-day course of rHGH (20 units subcutaneously daily). In the total parenteral nutrition group the rate of net loss of protein decreased from 0.82(0.17) g kg-1 day-1 to 0.43(0.20) g kg-1 day-1 (P less than 0.02) following the administration of rHGH. The rate of appearance of leucine was not altered, suggesting that the improvement in nitrogen balance following rHGH was because of an increased rate of protein synthesis rather than reduced catabolism. In the postabsorptive group, rHGH treatment significantly increased the rate of appearance of free fatty acids (from 7.4(2.2) mumol kg-1 min-1 to 11.1(2.6) mumol kg-1 min-1, P less than 0.03) and free fatty oxidation (from 1.3(0.4) mumol kg-1 min-1 to 1.7(0.4) mumol kg-1 min-1, P less than 0.06), while the rate of leucine oxidation was reduced (from 0.44(0.05) mumol kg-1 min-1 to 0.26(0.03) mumol kg-1 min-1, P less than 0.005). Glucose appearance and oxidation remained unchanged. These results suggest that fat was being oxidized in preference to protein, which resulted in a reduction in the net rate of loss of protein of 0.3 g kg-1 day-1 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that rHGH administration is capable of significantly reducing net protein loss in septic or injured surgical patients. Recombinant HGH may be clinically useful in supporting critically ill surgical patients who require intensive nutritional support.\r"

The binding site (Bmax) of [3H]PN 200-110 in cardiac membranes isolated from streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats (128 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein) significantly (P less than 0.01) increased by 64% compared with that of control rats (78 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein) 10 wk after STZ administration without a significant change in Kd. However, the significant increase in Bmax of [3H]PN 200-110 binding in diabetic rats depended on the duration of diabetes such that the increase was not found until 6 wk after STZ injection. An 8-wk intensive insulin treatment, which was initiated 2 wk after STZ injection, normalized the increase in [3H]PN 200-110 binding in STZ-D rats to control levels (85 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein). Furthermore, [3H]PN 200-110 binding to control cardiac membranes was dose-dependently inhibited in the presence of verapamil, a phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist, but that was not the case in cardiac membranes isolated from STZ-D rats. These results indicate that voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in cardiac muscle isolated from STZ-D rats are quantitatively and qualitatively altered, because the course of diabetes and the increase in the channels can be prevented by treatment with insulin.\r"

Class I expression was dose-dependently augmented by incubation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Although neither IFN-gamma nor TNF alone induce class II molecules on islet cells, synergistic interaction of IFN-gamma (200 U/ml) and TNF (200 U/ml) may induce class II expression on approximately 50% of islet cells. Niacinamide and 3-aminobenzamide, both inhibitors of ADP ribosylation and scavengers of free radicals, attenuated the class II expression induced by IFN-gamma and TNF. Twenty millimolar niacinamide and 10 mM 3-aminobenzamide reduced the rates of class II antigen-positive cells to mean +/- SD 3.6 +/- 0.3 and 6.1 +/- 1.9%, respectively. The agents did not affect the cytokine-induced augmentation of class I antigens. The inhibition of class II molecule expression may at least partly account for the preventive effect of niacinamide on autoimmune-associated beta-cell damage in NOD mice.\r"

In one protocol, six dogs were ventilated with CV or HFV at f = 6 Hz and tidal volume (VT) selected supine for eucapnia. A coronal cross section of the lung base was studied in the supine, prone, and right and left lateral decubitus positions. In a second protocol, six dogs were studied prone: apical and basal cross sections were studied in CV and in HFV with f = 3 and 9 Hz at eucapnic VT. Regional alveolar ventilation per unit of lung volume (spVr) was calculated for selected regions and analyzed for gravity-dependent cephalocaudal and right-to-left gradients. In both CV and HFV, nonuniformity in spVr was highest supine and lowest prone. In CV there were vertical gradients of spVr in all body positions: nondependent less ventilated than dependent regions, particularly in the supine position. In HFV there was a moderate vertical gradient in spVr in addition to a preferentially ventilated central region in all body positions. Overall lung spV was unaffected by body position in CV but in HFV was highest supine and lowest prone. Nonuniformity in eucapnic prone HFV was unaffected by f and always higher than in CV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the hypothesis that endogenous ANP may also lower MPAP in this model, C-ANP-(4-23), a ring-deleted analogue of ANP that binds to the biologically silent ANP clearance receptor (C-ANP receptor) but not to the ANP biological receptor (B-ANP receptor), was administered intravenously as a bolus injection (10 micrograms/kg) followed by an infusion (1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min) to rats adapted to hypoxia (10% O2) for 4 wk and to air control rats. C-ANP-(4-23) significantly lowered MPAP in hypoxic rats but not in air controls. A statistically insignificant reduction in mean systemic arterial pressure was found in both groups after C-ANP-(4-23) administration. C-ANP-(4-23) significantly (two- to threefold) increased endogenous plasma ANP levels in both groups; the increase was not significantly different between groups. Both basal and post-C-ANP-(4-23) levels of plasma ANP were greater in hypoxia-adapted animals than in air controls; the C-ANP-induced increase in plasma ANP was not significantly different between groups. These results suggest that the endogenous ANP may modulate pulmonary vascular tone in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.\r"

The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the inhibition constants for chloride (Ki,Cl) and ethoxzolamide (Ki,ez) were the same for methods 1, 2, and 3. The turnover numbers were 270,000, 400,000, and 555,000 s-1 by methods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Values for CO2 hydration velocity measured by methods 2 and 3 on the same solution of BCA at the same time were the same. Km, maximal reaction velocity (Vmax), Ki,ez, and Ki,Cl obtained from normal human hemolysate at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2 by methods 2 and 3 were the same. Km and Vmax of the carbonic anhydrase isozyme CA III of homogenate from rabbit soleus were also identical by methods 1 and 3. According to Michaelis-Menten theory, the values of Km and Vmax obtained by method 3 should have been significantly smaller than those obtained by methods 1 and 2. We conclude that the catalytic step itself is apparently not rate limiting under physiological conditions and that method 3 can be used to obtain Michaelis-Menten characteristics of carbonic anhydrase.\r"

Lambs were exposed to air (controls) or to 1 ppm O3 for 4 h/day for 5 days during the 1st wk of life. Tracheal mucus velocity (TMV), a marker of lung mucociliary clearance, was measured in vivo at birth (0 wk) and up to 24 wk later, and tracheal secretory function was measured (in vitro) and the morphology of the tracheal mucosa was determined at 0 and 2 wk in both groups. In the control group, TMV increased 94% from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05), continued to increase until reaching a plateau at 8 wk, and then remained constant from 8 to 24 wk. In contrast, O3-exposed lambs showed a 24% decrease in TMV from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05 vs. control), and throughout the remaining time TMV remained below (P less than 0.05) that observed in control lambs. O3 exposure partially prevented the age-dependent decrease in basal secretion of tracheal macromolecules normally observed between 0 and 2 wk. These changes in secretory function were associated with a significant increase in tissue conductance (37%, P less than 0.05 vs. 0 wk), predominantly the result of active chloride secretion. The functional changes induced by O3 were associated with a retardation of the normal morphological development of the tracheal epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The precise manner by which this occurs is unclear but may involve intrinsic mechanisms related to the muscular pump, neural influences, and chemoreceptor control. Recent observations suggest that submaximal threshold loads may result in hyperventilation. In this study we explicitly examined the respiratory effects of sustained threshold loading in normal subjects. We found that sustained threshold loading resulted in hyperventilation associated with high P100's (mouth pressure 100 ms after the start of an occluded breath) and increased tidal volumes but with little effect on duty cycle or respiratory rate. In addition, this increased respiratory motor output was sustained for 30-60 s after the load was removed. At very high threshold loads, hyperventilation failed to occur, despite increased P100's. We conclude that threshold loading results in increased respiratory motor output and hyperventilation, a response that is different from that observed with either resistive or elastic loads, and that the failure to hyperventilate at the higher loads may be the result of mechanical limitation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether cyclooxygenase inhibitors alter parasympathetic control of airway smooth muscle in situ, we pretreated anesthetized dogs with intravenous indomethacin, meclofenamate, or normal saline and measured the isometric contraction of tracheal muscle in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves. Indomethacin and meclofenamate increase the response of airway smooth muscle to parasympathetic stimulation. In subsequent experiments to determine the site of action of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, we found that indomethacin does not alter the response of tracheal muscle to intra-arterial acetylcholine (a muscarinic agonist) but does augment the response to intra-arterial dimethylpiperaziniumiodide (a nicotinic agonist). Moreover, the response to parasympathetic stimulation after pretreatment with a combination of indomethacin and BW755C (a combined cyclooxygenase-lipoxygenase inhibitor) does not differ significantly from the response after indomethacin or meclofenamate alone. We conclude that cyclooxygenase inhibitors increase the sensitivity of the contractile response of tracheal smooth muscle to parasympathetic stimulation, that they exert their effect on the postganglionic parasympathetic neuron, and that their effect is prejunctional. The effect appears secondary to a decrease in cyclooxygenase products rather than to an increase in lipoxygenase products. These findings suggest that endogenous cyclooxygenase products may modulate parasympathetic control of airway smooth muscle in vivo. They may relate to the mechanisms that underlie airway hyperresponsiveness, by which mediators of inflammation modulate airway responsiveness and by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce severe bronchoconstrictor responses in some persons who have asthma.\r"

Specific attention was paid to recording operative details, including technical difficulties associated with insertion of the nails. Technical difficulties were encountered in insertion of the proximal screw, distal screw, and nail, and in deployment of the fins. Insertion of the Russell-Taylor nail was associated with less technical difficulty, operative time, and estimated loss of blood. The two nails differ in their biomechanical properties, methods of fixation, and instrumentation. These differences did not affect the clinical outcome; the fractures in both groups of patients healed with excellent functional results.\r"

Bone debris from reaming of the endosteal canal is deposited in the soft tissues surrounding the site of insertion of the nail, and we postulated that this debris may stimulate the formation of heterotopic bone and that decreasing the amount of debris left in the tissues after nailing may decrease the amount of heterotopic ossification. To test this theory, the patients were treated with routine intramedullary nailing and were randomly divided into two groups. In Group I, the operative incision was irrigated with 250 milliliters of normal saline solution with use of a bulb syringe before the wound was closed, and in Group II, the incision was irrigated with 3000 milliliters of normal saline solution with use of pulsatile lavage. The two groups were similar in all other respects. Eighty patients (eighty fractures; forty in Group I and forty in Group II) were available for follow-up and were evaluated in a blind fashion after the fracture had united. A grading system that was based on the length of the heterotopic ossification, as measured on antero-posterior radiographs of the hip, was used. In thirty-two of the patients (40 per cent), no heterotopic ossification developed, whereas minimum or mild ossification developed in twenty-seven patients (34 per cent). Moderate ossification developed in twelve patients (15 per cent) and severe ossification, in nine patients (11 per cent).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An extracorporeal circuit was established so that the nutrient artery of the tibia could be perfused in vivo under conditions of constant blood flow. Diverse vasoactive substances were injected into the perfusion circuit in small volumes as a bolus close to the nutrient artery of the tibia. A range of doses of nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, isoproterenol, methoxamine, U46619 (a thromboxane A2 mimic), dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, and endothelin-1 were injected in a randomized sequence for each experiment. The antagonists that were used were atropine (a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist), ICI 118551 (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), ONO 3708 (a prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist), and prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist). The results of changes in bone-perfusion pressure under conditions of constant blood flow indicated that the vascular bed of bone actively responds to various vasoconstrictor mechanisms, whereas vasodilator mechanisms appear to be considerably less active. Intra-arterial injections of nitroglycerin, acetylcholine, and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP resulted in dose-related decreases in bone-perfusion pressure that were weak relative to concomitant changes in systemic arterial pressure. Intra-arterial administration of methoxamine, U46619, and endothelin-1 resulted in a potent dose-related increase in bone-perfusion pressure. The results of intra-arterial injections of isoproterenol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were surprising; both substances caused a substantial rise in bone-perfusion pressure. The responses to acetylcholine, methoxamine, and U46619 were blocked in a competitive manner after administration of atropine, prazosin, and ONO 3708, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms that might be responsible for the low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) associated with hypertriglyceridemia were studied in an animal model. Specific monoclonal antibodies were infused into female cynomolgus monkeys to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the rate-limiting enzyme for triglyceride catabolism. LPL inhibition produced marked and sustained hypertriglyceridemia, with plasma triglyceride levels of 633-1240 mg/dl. HDL protein and cholesterol and plasma apolipoprotein (apo) AI levels decreased; HDL triglyceride (TG) levels increased. The fractional catabolic rate of homologous monkey HDL apolipoproteins injected into LPL-inhibited animals (n = 7) was more than double that of normal animals (0.094 +/- 0.010 vs. 0.037 +/- 0.001 pools of HDL protein removed per hour, average +/- SEM). The fractional catabolic rate of low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein did not differ between the two groups of animals. Using HDL apolipoproteins labeled with tyramine-cellobiose, the tissues responsible for this increased HDL apolipoprotein catabolism were explored. A greater proportion of HDL apolipoprotein degradation occurred in the kidneys of hypertriglyceridemic than normal animals; the proportions in liver were the same in normal and LPL-inhibited monkeys. Hypertriglyceridemia due to LPL deficiency is associated with low levels of circulating HDL cholesterol and apo AI. This is due, in part, to increased fractional catabolism of apo AI. Our studies suggest that variations in the rate of LPL-mediated lipolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins may lead to differences in HDL apolipoprotein fractional catabolic rate.\r"

  ".W": "In the hematopoietic system a pluripotent stem cell generates precursors for lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Proenkephalin-derived peptides were previously detected in differentiated lymphoid cells. We have studied whether the proenkephalin system is expressed in a typical differentiated cell of the myeloid lineage, the neutrophil. Human peripheral polymorphonuclear cells contain and release proenkephalin-derived peptides. The opioid portion of proenkephalin (met-enkephalin-containing peptides) was incompletely processed, resulting in the absence of low molecular weight products. The nonopioid synenkephalin (proenkephalin 1-70) molecule was completely processed to a 1.0-kD peptide derived from the COOH-terminal. This molecule was characterized in neutrophils by biochemical and immunocytochemical methods. The chemotactic peptide FMLP and the calcium ionophore A23187 induced the release of the proenkephalin-derived peptides, and this effect was potentiated by cytochalasin B. The materials secreted were similar to those present in the cell, although in the supernatant a higher proportion corresponded to more processed products. The 1.0-kD peptide was detected in human, bovine, and rat neutrophils, but the chromatographic pattern of synenkephalin-derived peptides suggests a differential posttranslational processing among species. These findings demonstrate the existence of the proenkephalin system in human neutrophils and the production and release of a novel 1.0-kD peptide derived from the synenkephalin molecule. The presence of opioid peptides in neutrophils suggests their participation in the inflammatory process, including a local analgesic effect.\r"

  ".W": "Acute ultraviolet light B (UVB) injury is associated with dermal mast cell histamine release. The possibility that histamine-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) synthesis could be a mechanism for irradiation erythema was therefore examined using human skin explants. Explants responded to UV irradiation (120 mJ/cm2) with a fivefold increase in synthesis of prostaglandins E2, F2 alpha and 6-keto PGF1 alpha. Incubating explants with the H1 antihistamines brompheniramine (50 microM) or pyrilamine (30 microM) inhibited PG release from irradiated explants 63 +/- 4.9% (mean +/- SEM) 6 h after UV exposure. Antihistamines did not affect PG synthesis in control explants. Irradiation increased the histamine concentration in explant conditioned medium only 50% over basal values, suggesting that irradiation enhanced histamine responsiveness. Explants were therefore incubated with exogenous histamine. In irradiated explants, PG synthesis was stimulated threefold by 3 microM histamine. Unirradiated explants' PG synthesis was unaffected by histamine. Enhanced histamine sensitivity was also examined in epidermal cell cultures. In irradiated cultures, histamine sensitivity was again markedly potentiated: as little as 1 microM histamine stimulated significant PGE2 release and the response to 10-30 microM histamine was increased six to eight times compared with that of unirradiated cultures. These studies demonstrate that endogenous histamine stimulates PG synthesis in human skin after UV injury by potentiation of histamine-induced prostaglandin release. Potentiated agonist responses induced by UV exposure may contribute to the effects of UVB irradiation injury and in particular to irradiation erythema.\r"

In isolated cells, both agents significantly decreased initial rates of influx of 22Na and caused a persistent decrease in intracellular pH (pHi); effects that are not additive to those caused by amiloride (10(-3) M). The ED50 for APIII was 0.3 nM. In intact mucosa, both 8-Br-cGMP (10(-4) M) and 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride (MIBA) (10(-5) M) reduced JNams and JNa.net, their effects were not additive. APIII (10(-7) M) significantly increased cellular cGMP but not cAMP. Both 8-Br-cGMP (10(-4) M) and APIII (10(-7) M) stimulated a persistent increase in cytosolic calcium (Cai), which could be prevented by pretreating the cells with the cytosolic calcium buffering agent MAPTAM or with H-8, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with H-8 or the calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium (CM), prevented the effects of 8-Br-cGMP and APIII on pHi. However, the pHi response to subsequent addition of the calcium-ionophore ionomycin was blocked only by CM and not by H-8. These data suggest that APIII and 8-Br-cGMP inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na/H exchange by increasing Cai, an event requiring activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase.\r"

In fasted rats the processes of glycogen synthesis and degradation were observed to occur simultaneously with the rate of synthesis much greater than degradation leading to net glycogen synthesis. In fed rats, incorporation of infused D-[1-13C]glucose occurred briskly; however, over 2 h there was no net glycogen accumulated. Degradation of labeled glycogen was greater in the fed versus the fasted rats (P less than 0.001), and the lack of net glycogen synthesis in fed rats was due to degradation and synthesis occurring at similar rates throughout the infusion period. There was no indication that suppression of phosphorylase a or subsequent activation of glycogen synthase was involved in modulation of the flux of tracer into liver glycogen. We conclude that in both fed and fasted rats, glycogen synthase and phosphorylase are active simultaneously and the levels of liver glycogen reached during refeeding are determined by the balance between ongoing synthetic and degradative processes.\r"

  ".U": "90347063\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the contribution of endogenous prostanoids to baroreceptor activation in chronic renal hypertension. Baroreceptor activity was recorded from the vascularly isolated carotid sinus during slow ramp increases in pressure in rabbits anesthetized with pentothal and chloralose. Mean arterial pressure averaged 133 +/- 4 mmHg in hypertensive rabbits (one kidney, one wrap, n = 12) and 85 +/- 3 mmHg in normotensive rabbits (one kidney, no wrap, n = 13). Baroreceptor activity was decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) in the hypertensive compared with the normotensive rabbits. The decreased baroreceptor activity could not be explained by decreased distensibility of the carotid sinus (sonomicrometers). Inhibition of the endogenous formation of prostanoids with intrasinus administration of indomethacin (50 microM) decreased baroreceptor activity in normotensive (P less than 0.05) but not in hypertensive rabbits over a wide range of pressures. At a pressure of 120 mmHg, activity declined from 61 +/- 14 spikes/s before indomethacin to 47 +/- 12 spikes/s with indomethacin, i.e., a drop of 24 +/- 4%. In contrast, corresponding values in hypertensive rabbits averaged 41 +/- 13 and 40 +/- 12 spikes/s (-1 +/- 2%). Intrasinus prostacyclin, on the other hand, increased activity in both groups: at 120 mmHg activity increased from 62 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 15 spikes/s (51 +/- 17%) in normotensive rabbits and from 29+/- 7 to 47 +/- 14 spikes/s (68 +/- 23%) in hypertensive rabbits. Neither indomethacin nor prostacyclin (n = 5) influenced the pressure-diameter relation of the carotid sinus. The increase in prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF 1 alpha) formation by the sinus in response to its exposure to arachidonic acid (10 microM) was significant (P less than 0.05) in the normotensives (1,627 +/- 344%; n = 5) but not in the hypertensives (583 +/- 353%; n = 5). We conclude that the decreased baroreceptor activity in chronic hypertension may not be caused by decreased distensibility of the vascular wall of the sinus and that endogenous prostanoids that contribute to baroreceptor activation in normotensive rabbits fail to do so in hypertensive rabbits. This appears to be due to decreased formation of prostacyclin rather than decreased sensitivity of the baroreceptors to prostacyclin. The results suggest a new mechanism that contributes to chronic baroreceptor resetting in hypertension.\r"

In the present study we show that a gene homologous to the CCK-related hormone, gastrin, is expressed in the human testis. The mRNA hybridizing to a human gastrin cDNA probe in the human testis was of the same size (0.7 kb) as gastrin mRNA in the human antrum. By in situ hybridization the gastrinlike mRNA was localized to seminiferous tubules. Immunocytochemical staining of human testis revealed gastrinlike peptides in the seminiferous tubules primarily at a position corresponding to spermatids and spermatozoa. In ejaculated spermatozoa gastrinlike immunoreactivity was localized to the acrosome. Acrosomal localization could also be shown in spermatids with electron microscopy. Extracts of the human testis contained significant amounts of progastrin, but no bioactive amidated gastrins. In contrast, ejaculated sperm contained mature carboxyamidated gastrin 34 and gastrin 17. The concentration of gastrin in ejaculated human spermatozoa varied considerably between individuals. We suggest that amidated gastrin (in humans) and CCK (in other mammals) are released during the acrosome reaction and that they may be important for fertilization.\r"

The late and persistent responses to PAF may result from the production of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). The effects of PAF on IL-1 release by human monocytes were studied with PAF alone and in combination with interferon-gamma. These studies involved the use of D10.G4.1 cells in a proliferation assay to determine the actual concentration of active IL-1 in monocyte supernatant and pellet fractions. These studies confirmed that PAF stimulates IL-1 release at two different ranges of PAF concentrations, 100 fM to 1 pM and 100 pM to 1 nM. PAF inhibited IL-1 release at 1 or 10 pM. PAF effects on IL-1 release were specific to the form of PAF that is biologically active in most system; (S)-PAF and lyso-PAF had no effect. When monocytes were incubated with both PAF and interferon-gamma, IL-1 release was greatly stimulated at the same two ranges of PAF concentrations, 100 fM to 1 pM and 100 pM to 1 nM of PAF. PAF and interferon-gamma interacted synergistically to enhance significantly the release of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that the 3G11, CD45RB, and Pgp-1 determinants are differentially expressed on CD4+ T cell subsets in the mouse. We used multicolor immunofluorescence staining and flow cytofluorometric analysis to examine the expression of each of these determinants on splenic CD4+ cells from young (age 3 to 6 mo) and aged (age 24 to 26 mo) C57BL/6 mice. The CD4+ pool from aged mice contained significantly reduced numbers of 3G11+ and CD45RBhi cells, but increased numbers of Pgp-1hi cells, in comparison with the young group. Analysis of the simultaneous expression of all three subset determinants on CD4+ cells revealed that, in young mice, the major fraction (greater than 50%) was 3G11+CD45RBhiPgp-1lo. Among the less prevalent cell phenotypes, reductions in 3G11 expression correlated with decreases in CD45RB levels and increases in Pgp-1 levels. The phenotype that dominated the young group (3G11+CD45RBhiPgp-1lo) was approximately fivefold less represented in the aged group. The CD4+ pool from aged mice was characterized by increases in the 3G11-CD45RBvariablePgp-1hi and the 3G11+CD45RBloPgp-1hi phenotypes. To evaluate possible age-associated differences in cytokine secretion patterns by splenic CD4+ cells, purified CD4+ cells from each age group were stimulated in vitro with immobilized anti-CD3 epsilon mAb and accessory cells. At various times thereafter, supernatants from cultures were tested for IL-2 and IL-4 content by using the CTLL.6 and 11.6 bioassays, respectively, and the CD4+ cells were assayed for [3H]TdR uptake. Cell cultures from the aged group exhibited similar peak IL-2 accumulation and lower peak [3H]TdR uptake, but greatly increased peak IL-4 accumulation, as compared with cell cultures from the young group. The expression patterns of subset determinants, in conjunction with cytokine secretion profiles, indicate that, in aged mice, marked alterations occur in the subset composition of the splenic CD4+ cell pool. These findings are discussed in the context of previous findings on changes in T cell reactivity with advancing donor age.\r"

From our results, three major mechanisms that are essential to the CP-induced skin allograft tolerance were sequentially elucidated. The first mechanism was destruction of donor-Ag-stimulated T cells in the periphery by CP treatment. The second mechanism was intrathymic clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells, such as V beta 6+ T cells, correlating strongly with intrathymic mixed chimerism. The clonal deletion, however, was not always essential for the maintenance of the skin allografts, because DBA/2 skin survived even after the clonal deletion terminated and V beta 6+ T cells reappeared in the periphery of the recipient BALB/c mice. The third mechanism was generation of tolerogen-specific suppressor T cells, especially in the late stage of the tolerance. In contrast, the clonal anergy that is evidenced by the specific suppression of mixed lymphocyte reaction in the recipient BALB/c mice after injecting with DBA/2 spleen cells alone was not considered as a significant mechanism in prolonging skin allograft survival because such anergic mice showed accelerated rejection of the skin allografts. These results may suggest practical hierarchy of the mechanisms of CP-induced allograft tolerance.\r"

At least three different types of gamma-chains (V gamma 2-C gamma 1, C gamma 2, and C gamma 4) were shown to be expressed in these cells. Analysis of V delta gene segment usage in these hybridomas was performed by Northern blot hybridizations using probes specific for the V delta 1 through V delta 6 gene families and electrophoretic analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA obtained using V region-specific oligonucleotide primers for the V delta gene families as well as for V alpha 10, V alpha 4, and V alpha 11. These analyses revealed that V delta 5 gene segments are used by a high percentage of splenic gamma delta CD4-CD8- T cells (53% of the cells in our panel). Other V delta segments expressed by our panel of cells were V delta 2, V delta 4, V delta 6, and V alpha 10, indicating that the V delta repertoire expressed in the spleen is similar, but possibly not identical to the adult thymus repertoire. Sequence analysis of the V-D-J joinings of the delta-chain messages revealed substantial diversity, indicating that the delta-chain repertoire expressed in peripheral lymphoid organs uses a significant portion of the potential diversity predicted for these chains. These results demonstrate that, in spite of the low numbers of gamma delta T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs, the diversity of their TCR is extensive enough to play an important role in the immune response.\r"

Our results demonstrate that human rIL-1 beta and a bioactive nonapeptide of human IL-1 beta inhibit the induction of tolerance to HGG suggesting that IL-1 affects tolerance induction through a noninflammatory mechanism of action because the immunoactive nonapeptide possesses only immunomodulatory properties. Further, TNF-alpha but not IL-6, cytokines with many bioactivities in common with IL-1, was found to inhibit the induction of tolerance. Therefore, it appears unlikely that IL-6 plays a role in the pathway by which either IL-1 or TNF-alpha interferes with tolerance induction. Although IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma were incapable of directly affecting the induction of tolerance to HGG, it was determined that IL-4 and IFN-gamma were capable of inhibiting the ability of IL-1 to abrogate tolerance induction. It has been suggested that IL-1 induces the generation of endogenous IL-1 in vivo. Further, it has been demonstrated that IFN-gamma as well as IL-4 inhibits the synthesis of IL-1. Inasmuch as IL-4 and IFN-gamma inhibit the ability of IL-1 to abrogate tolerance induction, it appears that it is the endogenously generated IL-1 that interferes with tolerance induction. It was also determined that neither IL-4 nor IFN-gamma inhibits the activity of IL-1 which is consistent with results reported by others. Thus, results presented here suggest that the inhibition of tolerance induction to HGG by IL-1 may involve the stimulation of endogenous IL-1 synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral TCR V beta repertoire is strongly influenced by the processes of negative selection (deletion) and positive selection in the thymus. In order to investigate whether such selection events influence the V alpha repertoire, we have produced an anti-V alpha 11 mAb. This antibody was made by immunization with a chimeric TCR:Ig protein containing V alpha 11 in place of the VH of an IgG2a, lambda Ig. This scheme optimizes the specificity of immunization and facilitates the screening procedure. The antibody recognizes a panel of V alpha 11-expressing T cell clones. Analysis of mouse strains indicates that the antibody recognizes V alpha 11 only in mice of the C57 background. The expression of the epitope on peripheral T cells is strongly biased to the CD4+ subset, suggesting positive selection of V alpha 11 on class II MHC molecules. In some strain comparisons, the percentage of V alpha 11-expressing T cells in the CD4+ subset was elevated in I-E+ relative to I-E- strains. These data suggest that V alpha 11 can differentially influence the selection of T cells into the CD4+/CD8+ subsets.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of mice with an immunogenic dose of carrier (keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)) followed by immunization with hapten-carrier conjugate (TNP-KLH) selectively suppresses anti-hapten antibody response. In this study, the cellular basis of this epitopic suppression and also of the suppression induced by a high dose of carrier were analyzed by in vivo depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets by using mAb. The mAb treatments were performed either at the time of carrier priming or at the time of hapten-carrier immunization. The elimination of CD8+ T cells has not modified the anti-carrier antibody response, whether this treatment was performed at the time of KLH-priming or during TNP-KLH immunization. Moreover, the in vivo treatment with the anti-CD8 mAb did not modify the carrier-induced epitopic suppression induced either by a low immunogenic dose of KLH or by a high dose of this Ag. The elimination of CD4+ T cells at the time of KLH immunization has prevented the induction of a memory response to KLH, clearly establishing that CD4+ T cells are essential in memory B cell development to T-dependent Ag. Moreover, this treatment has totally abrogated the epitopic suppression induced either by low or high dosages of KLH. In contrast, the in vivo elimination of CD4+ T cells after carrier immunization did not abolish the secondary anti-carrier antibody response and did not prevent the expression of epitopic suppression. These data indicate that primed CD4+ T cells are required neither for memory B cell expression nor for the expression of suppression. Finally, once induced, the suppression can be evidenced after in vivo depletion of both primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data support the view that epitopic suppression is induced through the expansion of carrier-specific B cells and resulted from intramolecular antigenic competition between hapten and carrier epitopes.\r"

In our work, we show that anti-CD3 treatment of single positive CD4+ or CD8+ human medullary thymocytes (obtained by anti-CD1a plus C) induces their apoptotic death. Some events commonly associated with the early steps of normal activation (IL-2R expression, increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+) are also induced after anti-CD3 treatment. Nevertheless, IL-2 is not secreted by these activated cells. The addition of exogenous IL-2 inhibits the apoptosis induced by anti-CD3. We suggest that the lack of secretion of IL-2 by medullary thymocytes may be a physiologic mechanism implicated in the process of negative selection that leads to tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined mechanisms of tolerance to circulating self-proteins in mice that are transgenic for human insulin. Normal, nontransgenic mice develop serum antibody responses when injected with human insulin in CFA; syngeneic transgenic mice do not. B cell responsiveness was assessed by immunizing with human insulin coupled to a T-independent Ag, Brucella abortus. No differences were found in the numbers of insulin-specific splenic plaque-forming cells between transgenic and nontransgenic mice suggesting that insulin-specific B cells are not tolerant in transgenic mice. Similarly, APC from transgenic and nontransgenic mice display no differences in their ability to process and present human insulin to human insulin-specific T cells in vitro. However, marked differences were detected between transgenic and nontransgenic T cells. Lymph node T cells from transgenic mice primed with human insulin provided no detectable helper activity for secondary antibody responses to human insulin whereas, lymph node T cells from nontransgenic mice did. Nevertheless, lymph node T cells from transgenic mice developed significant proliferative responses to human insulin. Lymph node T cells obtained from transgenic and nontransgenic mice were fused to BW5147 and human insulin-specific T cell hybridomas were generated. The fact that human insulin-specific T cell hybridomas were obtained from the transgenic mice suggests that these T cells were not clonally deleted. In addition, APC from transgenic mice did not stimulate human insulin-specific hybridomas from normal mice in the absence of exogenous insulin. We suggest that T cells specific for human insulin are not deleted in the thymus of transgenic mice because APC in the thymus do not bear the requisite levels of endogenous human insulin/Ia complexes. Therefore, we conclude that tolerance in the transgenic mice is preserved by peripheral mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90347188\r", 
  ".W": "Fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC) were tested as a model system to induce, in a polyclonal fashion, negative and positive thymic selection events. By flow cytometry, thymocytes developed in FTOC differed in several parameters from their in vivo differentiated counterparts. In particular, no clear distinction was possible between CD4+CD8+ immature cells with low TCR expression and mature CD4+ or CD8+ cells with high TCR expression. Thymocyte development in FTOC was manipulated with three different antibody reagents: anti-V beta 8 (F23.1), anti-Lyt-2.2 (19/178) and the quadroma derived bifunctional antibody HPHT-2, carrying one binding site of each. This antibody served also as a monovalent anti-V beta 8 reagent in FTOC from Lyt-2.1 mouse strains. Antibody 19/178 suppressed the development of single positive CD8+ cells, but only at very high concentrations. F23.1 and HPHT-2 suppressed the development of CD4+V beta 8+ and CD8+V beta 8+ thymocytes at relatively low concentrations giving rise to V beta 8 occupancies from about 2% upwards. Suppression was equally pronounced in cells with low and high TCR densities. Moreover, V beta 8 suppression occurred upon divalent and monovalent V beta 8 binding and was not significantly influenced by V beta 8-CD8 cross-linking. This suggests that ligation of the TCR alone is sufficient for clonal deletion. The data do not exclude a role for CD8 as an accessory adhesion molecule but suggest that exogenous cross-linking of CD8 to the TCR is not essential in transmembrane signaling for clonal deletion. At lower antibody concentrations giving rise to V beta 8 occupancies below detection, V beta 8-CD8 cross-linking by HPHT-2, but no divalent and monovalent V beta 8 ligation, induced an increase of CD8+V beta 8+ cells at the expense of CD4+ V beta 8+ cells with no change in the proportion of total V beta 8+ thymocytes. The latter effect was quantitatively of borderline significance but reproducible. These latter results are compatible with the hypothesis that cross-linking of the alpha beta TCR and CD8 on the thymocyte surface provides a maturation signal resulting in loss of CD4 from CD4+ CD8+ double positive immature thymocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Ly-6A/E molecules are expressed on the surface of T cells and have been shown to function in activation by the capacity of anti-Ly-6A/E mAb to induce T cell hybridomas or normal T cells to produce IL-2. Recent evidence suggests that activation through Ly-6A/E may be linked to the TCR signaling pathway. To further investigate the relationship between Ly-6- and TCR-induced T cell activation, we have examined whether an anti-Ly-6A/E mAb (D7) modulates TCR signaling in vitro. We now report that mAb D7 specifically inhibited IL-2 production by T cells also activated through TCR. Such inhibition was noted for normal T cells stimulated by soluble anti-CD3 or alloantigen and for T hybridomas stimulated by soluble anti-CD3. The ability of D7 to inhibit IL-2 production by T hybridomas was dependent on the nature of the TCR activating signal because IL-2 production was not inhibited when T hybridomas were stimulated with Ag or immobilized anti-CD3. Inhibition of IL-2 production by D7 apparently required cross-linking of the mAb because D7 F(ab')2 fragments were not effective for inhibition of IL-2 production. Similar to its ability to enhance anti-Ly-6A/E-induced activation of T and B cells, IFN-gamma enhanced the D7-induced inhibition of IL-2 production by alloantigen-activated normal T cells. These data further support the notion that Ly-6 and TCR signaling pathways are interrelated.\r"
