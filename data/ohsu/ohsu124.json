  ".U": "87144590\r", 
  ".W": "Many important antibiotics such as tetracyclines, erythromycin, adriamycin, monensin, rifamycin and avermectins are polyketides. In their biosynthesis, multifunctional synthases catalyse iterated condensation of thio-esters derived from acetate, propionate or butyrate to yield aliphatic chains of varying length and carrying different alkyl substituents. Subsequent modifications, including aromatic or macrolide ring closure or specific methylations or glycosylations, generate further chemical diversity. It has been suggested that, if different polyketide synthases had a common evolutionary origin, cloned DNA coding for one synthase might be used as a hybridization probe for the isolation of others. We show here that this is indeed possible. Study of a range of such synthase genes and their products should help to elucidate what determines the choice and order of condensation of different residues in polyketide assembly, and might yield, by in vitro recombination or mutagenesis, synthase genes capable of producing novel antibiotics. Moreover, because genes for entire antibiotic pathways are usually clustered in Streptomyces, cloned polyketide synthase genes are valuable in giving access to groups of linked biosynthetic genes.\r"

The functional region or reactive centre of these inhibitors is near the C-terminal end and is an exposed site that acts as a bait for the appropriate serine protease to recognize and covalently bind. The specificity of the inhibitor is determined, at least in part, by a single amino acid that resides in this region at the P1 position. We show here that following a gene duplication event the reactive centres of three related rodent protease inhibitors have diverged from each other at unprecedented rates. This has resulted in proteins with different predicted specificities and we postulate that these changes were fixed by positive darwinian selection and that the most likely selective forces are extrinsic proteases, namely those used by parasites to facilitate their spread throughout the host.\r"

As a possible first step in characterizing the primary genetic abnormality, this finding may have important implications for the aetiology, nosology, pathophysiology and, possibly, prevention and treatment of bipolar affective disorder. It also provides a means for identifying and characterizing homogeneous populations of patients and may help in clarifying aetiological heterogeneity.\r"

How the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan patients is still not understood. No mutations at the Hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals. To derive an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of HPRT activity, to construct chimaeric mice. Two clonal lines carrying different mutant Hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras, allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as Lesch-Nyhan patients. Male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of HPRT activity.\r"

Ins (1,4,5)P3 is a putative second messenger which increases intracellular Ca2+ by mobilizing internal Ca2+ stores, a hypothesis which has been substantiated by studies with chemically permeabilized cells and with isolated microsomal membrane fractions. But the possibility that Ins(1,4,5)P3 could induce in intact cells an influx of external Ca2+ through transmembrane channels, originally hypothesized by Michell in 1975, has never been directly tested. We report here single-channel recordings of an Ins(1,4,5)P3-activated conductance in excised patches of T-lymphocyte plasma membrane. The Ins(1,4,5)P3-activated transmembrane channel appears to be identical to the recently described mitogen-regulated, voltage-insensitive Ca2+ permeable channel involved in T-cell activation. We suggest that Ins(1,4,5)P3 acts as the second messenger mediating transmembrane Ca2+ influx through specific Ca2+-permeable channels in mitogen-stimulated T-cell activation.\r"

We analysed the diversity of TCRs in a collection of H-2Kb-restricted, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP)-specific (H-2Kb/TNP) cytotoxic T-cell (Tc) clones from C57BL/6 mice. Investigation of the beta-chain messenger RNAs revealed that nearly half of these independent clones expressed an identical beta-chain gene. We show here that almost all the Tc clones expressing the predominant beta-chain gene also express an identical alpha-chain gene. These results show that a strong selective pressure acted on the Tc population, resulting in a skewing of the TCR repertoire for H-2Kb/TNP and in the dominant expression of one TCR with this specificity. Possible explanations for this skewing include antigen-driven clonal expansion and network interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines the inhibitory effect of segmentally applied TENS on the nociceptive component of the flexion reflex elicited in various lower limb muscles, in an attempt to gain some insight into the underlying mechanism. The flexion reflex from 11 normal subjects was recorded electromyographically from the biceps femoris (BF), the tibialis anterior (TA), and in 2 subjects, the hip flexor (HF), in the manner described in a previous paper [9]. Amplitude and area values of the flexion reflex of each muscle were computerized prior to, during, and 50 min after the application of placebo or low intensity TENS at 100 Hz, for 30 min to the low back, at levels of segmental innervation (L4-S1) similar to those of the muscles under study. In the majority of subjects, we found that: Low intensity TENS caused a significant inhibition of the flexion reflex in proximal limb flexors. Thus, the BF measured 64% and 52%, and the HF 45% and 51%, of their respective mean control amplitude and area values at the time of maximum inhibition during TENS. Moreover, less reduction of the mean values of the flexion reflex was observed in the TA, a distal limb (ankle) flexor. It is noteworthy that in both the BF and HF, the time to peak maximum inhibitory effect took 30 and 20 min respectively after the onset of TENS, and the flexion reflex often did not return to control values even at 40-50 min after TENS. In contrast, placebo TENS application resulted in no significant change of the flexion reflex in all the muscles examined. These findings showed that prolonged stimulation of large diameter fibers by conventional TENS application to the lumbosacral level, exerts a progressive and long latency inhibitory influence on a number of lower limb flexor motoneurons. In keeping with functional demand, this effect was found to be more prominent on the proximal than distal limb muscles. Furthermore, a gradual onset and offset of this inhibitory action is consistent with the results of some investigators demonstrating the possible involvement of endogenous opioids.\r"

Forty-three children who had greater than 2 episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the first year of life were followed for at least 1 year. Cultures of the oropharynx were done periodically, and the middle ear fluid (MEF) was cultured at the time of AOM. H. influenzae was recovered from MEF in 44% of the 136 AOM episodes recorded. Thirty-one children had at least one episode of AOM caused by H. influenzae; the remaining 12 children, designated as \"controls,\" had no otitis or had AOM caused by other organisms. The possible differences between carriage and infection strains were evaluated by comparison of MEF and oropharyngeal isolates, by pairwise comparison of MEF and oropharyngeal isolates and by pairwise comparison of multiple isolates from each host recovered at the time of AOM and during infection-free intervals. No significant differences in patterns of adherence, capsular type or biotype were found. The lack of correlation between these characteristics and infection suggests either that H. influenzae organisms have determinants of virulence yet to be defined or that variations in host susceptibility permit infection by the strain colonizing the upper respiratory tract. Adherence per se may be less important in the development of infection than in establishing and maintaining colonization within the host.\r"

  ".W": "The possible association between diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization and the subsequent occurrence of sudden infant death has been examined using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Cooperative Epidemiological Study, a large multicenter, population-based, case-control study. In a preliminary report based on the first 400 eligible singleton SIDS victims and 800 matched living control infants, no temporal association between SIDS and DTP immunization was found. From the final sample of 800 eligible singleton SIDS victims, 95% (n = 757) were defined as definitely or probably having died of SIDS on the basis of pathology data. Data from these 757 case infants and their corresponding control infants (n = 1,514) are presented in this report. Two control infants, both living, were randomly selected for each case infant: an age-matched control A and an age-, race-, and low birth weight-matched control B. Overall, case infants were less likely to have received any DTP immunization. Only 39.8% of case infants had received at least one DTP immunization compared to 55.0% of control A infants and 53.2% of control B infants. Based on maternal interviews and postnatal medical records, 1.8% of case infants (five infants) immunized with DTP died within the first 24 hours following immunization. Similarly, 5.0% of control A infants (n = 21) and 2.2% of control B infants (n = 9) had been immunized within 24 hours of the maternal interview, which represents the comparable time frame for the age-matched control infants. These results confirm the earlier preliminary findings from the NICHD SIDS Cooperative Epidemiological Study and suggest that DTP immunization is not a significant factor in the occurrence of SIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha 1AT, resulting in destruction of the lower respiratory tract by neutrophil elastase. As an approach to augment alpha 1AT levels in this disorder with physiologically normal human alpha 1AT, we have integrated a full-length normal human alpha 1AT cDNA into the genome of mouse fibroblasts. To accomplish this, the retroviral vector N2 was modified by inserting the simian virus 40 early promoter followed by the alpha 1AT cDNA. Southern analysis demonstrated that the intact cDNA was present in the genome of selected clones of the transfected murine fibroblasts psi 2 and infected NIH 3T3. The clones produced three mRNA transcripts (5.8, 4.8, and 2.4 kilobases) containing human alpha 1AT sequences, secreted an alpha 1AT molecule recognized by an anti-human alpha 1AT antibody, with the same molecular mass (52 kDa) as normal human alpha 1AT and that complexed with and inhibited human neutrophil elastase. The psi 2 produced alpha 1AT was glycosylated, and when infused intravenously into mice, it had a serum half-life similar to normal alpha 1AT purified from human plasma and markedly longer than that of nonglycosylated human alpha 1AT cDNA-directed yeast-produced alpha 1AT. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of using a retroviral vector to insert the normal human alpha 1AT cDNA into non-alpha 1AT-producing cells, resulting in the synthesis and secretion of physiologically \"normal\" human alpha 1AT.\r"

We have studied the ability of retroviral vectors to transfer genes into normal human diploid skin fibroblasts. Retroviruses carrying genes for neomycin or hygromycin B resistance conferred drug resistance to greater than 50% of the human fibroblasts after a single exposure to virus-containing medium. This represents at least a 500-fold increase in efficiency over other methods. Transfer was achieved in the absence of helper virus by using amphotropic retrovirus-packaging cells. A retrovirus vector containing a human adenosine deaminase (ADA) cDNA was constructed and used to infect ADA-fibroblasts from a patient with ADA deficiency. The infected cells produced 12-fold more ADA enzyme than fibroblasts from normal individuals and were able to rapidly metabolize exogenous deoxyadenosine and adenosine, metabolites that accumulate in plasma in ADA-deficient patients and are responsible for the severe combined immunodeficiency in these patients. These experiments indicate the potential of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into human fibroblasts for gene therapy.\r"

A cell line bearing an altered I-Ak alpha-chain (Ak alpha) molecule has been examined in order to provide more information about the relationship between Ia structure and function. The cell line, 3J9, was derived from the TA3 B-cell hybridoma through a series of negative and positive immunoselection steps. The 3J9 mutant lacked the binding site recognized by the Ak alpha-specific monoclonal antibody 39J and failed to present antigen to two T-cell hybridomas out of a large panel of I-Ak-restricted T-cell hybridomas examined. Sequence analysis of the mutant Ak alpha gene showed a single base transition (G----A) that resulted in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 75 of the alpha 1 domain. This mutation confirms the importance of amino acid 75 in the expression of the Ia.19 epitope, demonstrates the involvement of this region in the presentation of antigen to specific T cells, and provides a further example of the multiple functional domains on the Ia molecule that are involved in antigen presentation.\r"

We have identified a cDNA clone for murine CSF-1 by antibody screening of a mouse L-cell cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11. A screen of about 150,000 recombinant plaques yielded 6 clones that reacted well with an antibody raised against denatured and reduced mouse L-cell CSF-1. These clones were further screened with synthetic oligonucleotides based on the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of CSF-1. One clone, which hybridized to the oligonucleotides, was sequenced and found to contain a single open reading frame. This encompassed 68 amino acids of the mature protein, including the entire amino-terminal sequence we previously reported. This is preceded by what appears to be a 31 amino acid signal peptide. Blot analysis showed that this cDNA hybridizes to a major mRNA species of about 4.5 kilobases (kb) as well as several smaller, less abundant mRNA species (3.8, 2.3, and 1.4 kb) present in mouse L cells. A similar pattern of hybridization was observed with mRNA from a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line that produces CSF-1. Striking differences in the qualitative and quantitative expression of mRNA species for CSF-1 were observed in various mouse tissues. Liver expressed primarily a 1.4-kb species, heart and lung expressed primarily a 4.5-kb species, brain expressed high levels of both the 4.5-kb and 1.4-kb species, and intestine lacked detectable CSF-1 transcripts. Southern blot analysis suggests that the CSF-1 gene is present as a single copy in the mouse haploid genome and that it is not rearranged or amplified in L cells.\r"

We attempted to establish a relationship between the ease of the A-form----B-form helix transition and ease of nucleosome formation by reconstituting nucleosomes using ribosubstituted DNA containing various levels of ribonucleotides. Instead we discovered that, when riboadenosine is substituted for deoxyriboadenosine, even one ribonucleotide per 125 base pairs of DNA reduces nucleosome formation and that DNA containing greater than 5% ribonucleotide is completely unable to form nucleosomes. Ribosubstituted DNA restriction fragments exhibited altered mobility on native 6% polyacrylamide gels, indicating an altered helical structure (probably bending). The effects on both nucleosome formation and gel mobility are nucleotide specific and are correlated, being greatest for riboadenosine and decreasing in the order riboadenosine greater than riboguanosine greater than ribocytosine. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of nucleosome formation can be drastically reduced by isolated local perturbations, such as kinking or bending, in the helical structure of DNA.\r"

We have strong evidence that chromatin formation is critical for the transition of the injected DNA from methylation insensitivity to methylation sensitivity. Chromatin was reconstituted in vitro by using methylated and mock-methylated HSV TK DNA and purified chicken histone octamers. After microinjection, the methylated chromatin was always biologically inactive, as tested by autoradiography of the cells after incubation with [3H]thymidine and by RNA dot blot analysis. However, in transformed cell lines, reactivation of the methylated chromatin occurred after treatment with 5-azacytidine. Furthermore, integration of the TK chromatin into the host genome is not required to block expression of the methylated TK gene. Mouse cells that contained the pML-BPV-TK4 chromatin permanently in an episomal state also did not support TK gene expression as long as the TK DNA remained methylated.\r"

We found that this deletion resulted in an inability to propagate virus efficiently.

Using a gel electrophoresis DNA-binding assay, we have found a DNA-binding activity in BALB/c-3T3 cells that is induced within 20 min of treatment with conditioned medium from v-sis-transformed cells. A DNA methylation interference assay has shown that this factor binds to a sequence approximately 346 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site of the human c-fos gene. Insulin, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate fail to induce this DNA-binding factor. Protein synthesis inhibitors do not block the induction of this activity.

These cells also require IL-3 to display antigen-mediated serotonin release, which is coupled to a transient increase of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i). The antigen-mediated exocytosis is inhibited by phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate (PTA), an activator of phospholipid/Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase. In contrast, the malignant mast cell variant PB-1 is IL-3 independent with respect to proliferation but is unable to undergo antigen-mediated exocytosis. Yet this cell line exhibits basal levels of [Ca2+]i, serotonin content, and numbers of IgE receptors comparable to those of PB-3c cells. Subcellular distribution studies revealed that the specific activity of cytosolic protein kinase C of PB-1 cells was only 40% of that found in PB-3c cells. Furthermore, the PB-1 cells showed a significantly higher specific activity of membrane-bound protein kinase C than PB-3c cells. Scatchard plot analysis of [3H]-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding to intact PB-1 cells demonstrated the presence of 20% high-affinity (Kd = 6 nM) and 80% low-affinity (Kd = 60 nM) phorbol ester receptors, whereas PB-3c cells displayed only the low-affinity phorbol ester binding. Immunological characterization of protein kinase C from both cell lines revealed the presence of a normal 77-kDa protein kinase C holoenzyme in both cell lines. In addition, a 72-kDa protein kinase C-related protein band was found mainly in the membrane fraction of the PB-1 variant. It is suggested that this altered and membrane-bound form of protein kinase C may be involved in the blockage of the antigen-mediated exocytosis of PB-1 cells.\r"

Human 293.12 cultured cells that express a cloned gene for the E3/19K protein show reduced levels of HLA antigens on the cell surface compared to parental 293 cells. We have transfected these cell lines with plasmid DNA containing the murine histocompatibility H-2Kd allele to demonstrate that this antigen binds also to the E3/19K protein. The resulting association prevents the H-2Kd antigen from being terminally glycosylated and inhibits its cell-surface expression. Two murine cytolytic T-lymphocyte clones specific for HLA antigens and restricted by the H-2Kd antigen lyse the human 293Kd cells. In the presence of the E3/19K protein, a dramatically reduced cell surface density of both HLA and H-2Kd antigens was shown. This decreased amount of cell-surface HLA/H-2Kd antigens correlated with a reduction in susceptibility to lysis of the target cells. In particular, the cell-surface level of the H-2Kd antigen, which is the restricting element, was crucial for efficient lysis. Thus, the E3/19K protein of adenovirus type 2 indirectly reduces the cellular immune recognition in the in vitro system. This might be the mechanism involved in latent and persistent infections caused by adenoviruses in vivo.\r"

We demonstrate directly that memory B cells in spleens from PE-primed mice stain brightly with PE and produce strong IgG1 anti-PE responses when sorted and cultured with L3T4+ helper T cells. That is, as few as 500 sorted PE-binding cells per culture well are sufficient to produce high-level anti-PE responses, presenting antigen in a form that induces helper T cells. Three-color immunofluorescence studies reveal that cells staining brightly with PE reside primarily in a population of B220+(IgM,IgD)- cells and comprise 0.02-0.05% of the spleen cells. Complementary studies with 2,4-dinitrophenyl memory B cells show that whereas this B220+-(IgM,IgD)- population (which comprises only 1-2% of the spleen cells) gives high-affinity anti-dinitrophenyl responses, the predominant B220+(IgM,IgD)+ population yields only low-affinity antibody.

BSF-1 acting alone induced early B-cell activation, as assessed by a significant increase in cell diameter of single B cells cultured for 24 hr. A small but significant number of these B cells formed proliferating clones, some of which secreted antibody. When acting with the specific antigen fluorescein-polymerized flagellin, BSF-1 augmented early cell enlargement and markedly enhanced proliferation, but it did not increase the frequency of AFC clones stimulated by fluorescein-polymerized flagellin alone. The further addition of recombinant murine interleukin 1 (IL-1) marginally enhanced proliferation caused by antigen plus BSF-1. No synergy was observed between BSF-1 and IL-1 for antibody formation. In the presence of fibroblast filler cells, BSF-1 substantially inhibited AFC clone development achieved by antigen plus IL-1. BSF-1 was also found to be inhibitory to AFC clone development stimulated by specific antigen acting with either recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL-2) or with IL-2 plus IL-1, both in the presence or absence of filler cells. The results suggest that BSF-1 plays a complex role in the regulation of the B-cell activation pathway by enhancing early activation and antigen-specific proliferation as well as inhibiting the effects of other B-cell factors on antibody formation. BSF-1 is the only cytokine so far tested in the single B-cell system that acts with antigen to promote proliferation without concomitant antibody production.\r"

Adenosine receptors are membrane-bound proteins that appear to mediate some of the effects of ethanol in the brain. Human lymphocytes also have adenosine receptors, and their activation causes increases in cAMP levels. To test the hypothesis that basal and adenosine receptor-stimulated cAMP levels in lymphocytes might be abnormal in alcoholism, we studied lymphocytes from 10 alcoholic subjects, 10 age- and sex-matched normal individuals, and 10 patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. Basal and adenosine receptor-stimulated cAMP levels were reduced 75% in lymphocytes from alcoholic subjects. Also, there was a 76% reduction in ethanol stimulation of cAMP accumulation in lymphocytes from alcoholics. Similar results were demonstrable in isolated T cells. Unlike other laboratory tests examined, these measurements appeared to distinguish alcoholics from normal subjects and from patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. Reduced basal and adenosine receptor-stimulated levels of cAMP in lymphocytes from alcoholics may reflect a change in cell membranes due either to chronic alcohol abuse or to a genetic predisposition unique to alcoholic subjects.\r"

Forty subjects with either a history of recurrent jaw pain of three months' duration or of constant, chronic jaw pain that recurred within the preceding two months participated in the study. Twenty subjects received three 20-minute treatments of ICS, and 20 other subjects received three 20-minute treatments with a placebo procedure. The intensity of jaw pain and the amount of maximum vertical jaw opening were the dependent measures. Scatter diagrams indicated no relationship between the intensity of jaw pain and amount of vertical jaw opening before or after treatment. Statistical tests (p less than .05) showed no significant differences in the level of jaw pain or the amount of maximum vertical jaw opening between the ICS and Placebo Groups. We concluded that a short-term ICS treatment proved no more effective than a placebo treatment for decreasing jaw pain or for increasing vertical jaw opening.\r"

This event was characterized by studying the nasopharyngeal colonization of infants and children with B. catarrhalis and the clinical presentation and therapeutic outcome of acute otitis media caused by this organism. Pharyngeal colonization with B. catarrhalis was commoner in winter than summer. B. catarrhalis was present in middle-ear fluid (MEF) of 17% of children with otitis media, and was commoner in fall and winter (20%) than in spring and summer (11%, P less than .05). Seventy-five percent of isolates produced beta-lactamase (Ravasio type). In five of 20 patients, treatment with beta-lactamase-susceptible agents failed to sterilize B. catarrhalis-infected MEF. All of these five patients were infected with beta-lactamase-producing strains. The increasing prominence of antibiotic-resistant B. catarrhalis in acute otitis media may lead to a reevaluation of initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media, particularly in winter or in areas where colonization with such strains is prevalent.\r"

The messenger RNA corresponding to this clone was abundant in the cells of Bowman's glands in olfactory tissue but not in respiratory epithelium nor in several other tissues. The predicted sequence of this protein is homologous to members of a family of proteins that bind and transport small molecules in serum, suggesting that this protein may also bind and transport odorants in the mucus secreted by Bowman's glands.\r"

When the alpha genes encoding ICP-0, ICP-4, and ICP-27 and the gamma 1 gene encoding VP-5 were employed, only RNA transcripts hybridizing to the ICP-0 probe were detected. In latently infected cells, the ICP-0--related transcripts were localized principally in the nucleus; this was not the case in acutely (productively) infected neurons or in neurons probed for RNA transcripts coding for actin. In Northern blotting experiments, an RNA of 2.6 kilobases was detected with the ICP-0 probe. When single-stranded DNAs from the ICP-0 region were used as probes, RNA from the strand complementary to that encoding ICP-0 messenger RNA (mRNA) was the major species detected. This RNA species may play a significant role in maintaining the latent infection.\r"

Thus, the presence of this channel is not obviously correlated with B-cell differentiation. Although blocked by Co2+, the channel, or channels, does not appear to be activated by Ca2+ entry. It is, however, inactivated by high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, elevation of intracellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate induces at all potentials a rapid decrease in the peak potassium conductance and increased rates of activation and inactivation. Therefore, potassium channels can be physiologically modulated by second messengers in lymphocytes.\r"

A few known marker systems, however, detect loci that respond to restriction enzyme cleavage by producing a fragment that can have many different lengths. This polymorphism is due to variation in the number of tandem repeats of a short DNA sequence. Because most individuals will be heterozygous at such loci, these markers will provide linkage information in almost all families. Ten oligomeric sequences derived from the tandem repeat regions of the myoglobin gene, the zeta-globin pseudogene, the insulin gene, and the X-gene region of hepatitis B virus, were used to develop a series of single-copy probes. These probes revealed new, highly polymorphic genetic loci whose allele sizes reflected variation in the number of tandem repeats.\r"

Normally uncommon, the frequency of mosaicism is so greatly enhanced in a particular mutant strain that virtually every animal in the strain is an eye-color mosaic. The molecular basis of the mosaicism is the excision of the mariner element from its location in the DNA of the white gene in somatic cells. The phenomenon results from a single dominant genetic factor located in chromosome 3. Genetic control over the excision of transposable elements may play a role in determining the persistence of transposable elements in the genome.\r"

  ".W": "Because graft-versus-host disease remains a major complication in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, a number of techniques capable of removing mature T lymphocytes from bone marrow cells have been attempted. The authors describe a simple two-step procedure using counterflow centrifugation elutriation (CCE) that eliminated 95 to 98 percent of the mature T lymphocytes and greater than 97 percent of the T lymphocyte colony-forming units (CFU-T) while concentrating the bone marrow myeloid colony-forming cells. Viability was greater than 98 percent, and 72 to 98 percent of the total cells separated were recovered. Lymphocyte depletion was substantiated by both morphologic and phenotypic criteria using monoclonal antibodies to T lymphocytes, as well as by responsiveness in mixed-lymphocyte cultures and to mitogens. In addition, this technique separated the lymphoid colony-forming cells from the larger myeloid colony-forming cells. It was concluded that this simple two-step CCE procedure can be used to separate T lymphocytes and CFU-T from myeloid colony-forming cells and offers a means of purging T lymphocytes from large numbers of marrow cells that may be required for human allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\r"

In control experiments lytic granules were isolated from the formerly lytic CTLL-2 line as well as from Con A-activated lymphoblasts but not from the in vivo-primed CTL. The use of anti-P1 of CTLL-2 origin supports the above results in that immunoblots were positive with CTLL-2 extracts and isolated granules thereof but negative with extracts and isolated (nonlytic) granules from in vivo primed CTL; immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells gave similar results. We observed typical \"ring structures\" on EL4 membranes attacked by Ab + C as well as after exposure to lytic granules extracted from the formerly lytic CTLL-2 line; however, no such \"structures\" were observed after attack by the in vivo-primed CTL. These results are at variance with the recent suggestion of a common lytic mechanism--employed by CTL--of secreted lytic granules containing P1 (and P2) thereof that acts analogously to C9. An alternative mechanism for CTL-induced lysis not involving initial perforation of the TC membrane by 160A \"holes\" (Poly P1) has been presented elsewhere. It is important to note that our results with in vivo-primed CTL do not preclude involvement of a secreted, pore (channel)-forming agent(s) that is not observed by negative staining EM.\r"

The examinations were performed with a superconductive 1.5-T instrument with spin-echo sequences and ECG-gated multiple slices of 5-mm thickness. The location and plane direction of the scan were guided by findings on initial coronary MR scout scans and by a review of the angiograms. In four of the six patients both coronary orifices and the proximal centimeters of both coronary arteries were identified. In the remaining two, only the left proximal coronary artery was seen. Although segments of more peripherally located portions of the main coronary arteries and branches were detectable, a prospective and conclusive identification without knowledge of the angiographic anatomy would have been extremely difficult. Differential diagnostic problems, such as erroneous interpretation of pericardial recesses and coronary veins, were observed. Unsuccessful demonstration of the right coronary artery orifice in two cases coincided with more peripherally located occlusion of the vessels on the angiogram. MR with spin-echo sequences appears to be unsatisfactory for diagnosis of coronary arteriosclerotic disease, but it may be useful in other conditions that result in significant coronary dilatation, such as fistulae and aneurysms.\r"

ECG-gated, T1-weighted spin-echo MR imaging was performed at 0.3 or 1.0 T in six patients with classical tricuspid atresia, in one patient with tricuspid atresia due to an imperforate tricuspid valve, and in two with Ebstein's malformation. In the patients with classical tricuspid atresia, epicardial fat within the atrioventricular sulcus that was interposed between the right atrium and the ventricular mass caused increased intensity. This finding was not present in the patients with imperforate tricuspid valve or Ebstein's malformation in whom the sulcus appeared normal. Postmortem examination of five other hearts with classical tricuspid atresia revealed epicardial fat extending into the atrioventricular sulcus, which separated the right atrium and the ventricular mass. In three hearts with Ebstein's malformation, the sulcus extended only to the level of the atrioventricular junction. The characteristic MR appearance of fat adjacent to the muscular floor of the right atrium, therefore, serves to identify the atrioventricular sulcus and allows differentiation of the types of right atrioventricular valve atresia.\r"

  ".W": "Calcification overlying the left side of the heart on a chest radiograph may involve either the pericardium or, alternatively, the myocardium in association with a left ventricular aneurysm. Distinction between these two conditions can be of great clinical significance. To identify distinguishing features, we reviewed the radiographs and medical records of 29 patients: 14 had proven calcific pericarditis and 15 had proven calcified left ventricular aneurysm. Pericardial calcification was found primarily over the right-sided cardiac chambers (14 of 14 patients) and in the atrioventricular grooves (11 of 14), infrequently over the base of the left ventricle (five of 14), and rarely over the apex of the left ventricle (two of 14). When the left ventricle was involved, there was always more extensive calcification elsewhere in the pericardium. Myocardial calcification occurred predominantly in the apex of the left ventricle (13 of 15 patients), although it was rarely confined to the posterior wall of the left ventricle (two of 15). By noting characteristic sites of calcium deposition, pericardial calcification can be effectively distinguished from myocardial calcification. Isolated calcification in the region of the left ventricular apex, therefore, strongly suggests left ventricular aneurysm.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective analysis of anteroposterior supine radiographs in 34 patients was undertaken to determine the detectability of pleural effusions on supine radiographs. The presence of pleural effusions and quantity of fluid (small, moderate, or large) were evaluated by using the following radiographic signs: increased homogeneous density superimposed over the lung, loss of the hemidiaphragm silhouette, blunted costophrenic angle, apical capping, elevation of the hemidiaphragm, decreased visibility of lower-lobe vasculature, and accentuation of the minor fissure. Decubitus radiographs were performed to identify and to estimate the quantity of pleural fluid. Sixty-two hemithoraces were evaluated by three observers. From a total of 36 pleural effusions shown on decubitus views, 24 were correctly identified on supine radiographs (sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 70%, and accuracy of 67%). The most frequent but least specific criterion for detecting pleural effusions on supine radiographs is blunting of the costophrenic angle. Other helpful signs include loss of the hemidiaphragm and increased density of the hemithorax. A normal supine radiograph does not exclude a pleural effusion. Our results show that supine radiographs are only moderately sensitive and specific for the evaluation of pleural effusions.\r"

Unfortunately these studies are often of poor technical quality and are frequently difficult to interpret. Eighty-seven bedside chest radiographs and concurrent thoracic CT scans obtained in 56 critically ill patients over a 20-month period were interpreted retrospectively and independently. In most cases, the studies were obtained to search for a source of sepsis, fever, or unexplained clinical deterioration. In this series, thoracic CT added significantly more diagnostic information in 61 (70%) of these studies than was available from the corresponding bedside radiographs. Despite the difficulties of transporting critically ill patients for CT and the significant cost, our results suggest that the improved rate of detection of unsuspected thoracic disease justifies the use of CT when bedside radiographic examinations fail to adequately explain the clinical findings.\r"

Anteroposterior tracheal diameters were enlarged in 41 of the living adults. The average diameter was 1.3 +/- 0.9 SD standard deviations above the mean for normal subjects. These increases did not correlate with severity of pulmonary disease as judged radiographically. Enlargement seemed to have developed slowly, over many years or decades. A few tracheas were grossly irregular in outline. One patient had a severely increased transverse diameter of 4.7 standard deviations above the normal mean. The average transverse diameter was 0.3 +/- 1.1 SD standard deviations above the normal mean. The tracheas of adults and older adolescents who had died with cystic fibrosis were abnormally flaccid. Some collapsed suddenly during deflation. Microscopic examination showed instances of severe inflammation, focal epithelial metaplasia, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the mucous glands, degenerative changes in the muscle of the pars membranacea, and death of cartilage cells. The structural changes shown histologically and the many decades of frequent, vigorous coughing may be important in the enlargement of these tracheas and their flaccidity.\r"

Few reliable radiographic signs of tracheal rupture have been proposed. We diagnosed seven cases of tracheal rupture, two related to blunt trauma and five resulting from tracheal intubation. Early radiographic signs included orientation of the distal portion of the endotracheal tube to the right relative to the lumen of the trachea with an overdistended endotracheal balloon cuff, migration of the balloon toward the endotracheal tube tip, and pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. In four cases, the overdistended balloon with distal migration preceded the pneumomediastinum by several hours. An overdistended balloon in a patient after tracheal intubation or blunt chest trauma should suggest tracheal rupture.\r"

In all 20 patients with normal pancreas and in 34 of the 38 patients with suspected pancreatic disease excellent or good evaluation of the pancreas was achieved. A 0.35-T magnet (Diasonics MT/S) was used, and both T1- and T2-weighted images were needed. T1 and T2 relaxation times and MR signal intensities showed no specific pattern to allow consistent differentiation between normal and diseased pancreatic tissue or to distinguish between tumor and inflammation. In the 29 patients in whom MR and CT images could be compared, MR imaging and CT provided equivalent information in 20 (69%). In 4 patients (14%), MR imaging added information, and in 5 patients (17%) of cases, MR imaging yielded less information than CT. MR imaging of the pancreas was found to be superior to CT in selected instances, such as in the staging of pancreatic neoplasms (n = 4) and in the evaluation of pancreatic disease after surgery (n = 3). We conclude that, at present, MR imaging should not be used as the screening method for pancreatic disease but should be reserved as an adjunct when the information provided by CT is insufficient.\r"

There were six FNH and 10 malignant tumors including seven hepatocellular carcinomas, two cholangiocarcinomas, and one hepatoblastoma. Our results show that FNH has a fairly consistent appearance, dissimilar from that of malignant primary hepatic tumors. Four of six FNH lesions were isointense (except for a central scar in three) and indistinguishable from normal hepatic parenchyma on all pulse sequences, whereas two of six were homogeneous but slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences. Furthermore, a central hyperintense scar was seen in three of six lesions on T2-weighted sequences. In contrast, each of the malignant primary hepatic tumors was hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences and seven of 10 were hypointense on T1-weighted sequences; in nine of 10, heterogeneous areas of intensity were noted. In two fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinomas a central scar was seen that was hypointense on all pulse sequences. By using quantitative data, the best characterization was obtained by using lesion/normal-liver intensity ratios from a T2-weighted sequence; all FNH had a ratio less than 1.33, while in nine of 10 primary malignant tumors it was greater than 1.41. We conclude that focal nodular hyperplasia may have a consistent appearance on spin-echo MR imaging and probably can be distinguished from primary malignant lesions in most instances.\r"

Of 14 proven cases of appendicitis, 12 scans were positive for appendicitis with one false-positive scan, providing a sensitivity of 86%. Specificity was 93%: all negative cases except one had negative scans. Overall accuracy was 91% (29 of 32), comparing favorably with the accepted false-positive laparotomy rate of 25%.

MR was similar to CT in staging renal cell carcinomas (74% for MR vs 67% for CT). Neither CT nor MR was reliable in differentiating stage I from stage II lesions. MR clearly showed venous invasion without the use of IV contrast medium and was superior to CT in differentiating lymphadenopathy from small vascular structures. Because of the limited availability, longer imaging time, and more stringent patient requirements (patients with pacemakers, intracranial aneurysm clips, life-supporting systems, and severe claustrophobia need to be excluded), the authors recommend MR only for patients with known contraindications to iodinated contrast medium, patients with prior suboptimal bolus-contrast CT studies, or patients in whom the CT findings are equivocal.\r"

Radiographic skeletal surveys were performed in 24 patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy to analyze pattern (single layer, multilayered, irregular) and site of involvement (diaphysis, metaphysis, epiphysis). The six patients with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and the 11 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease had thicker, more widespread periostitis involving the diaphysis, metaphysis, and epiphysis, in contrast to abnormalities in the seven patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy secondary to carcinoma of the lung. Average cortical bone widths as determined by radiogrammetric measurement of the second metacarpals were significantly greater for the patients with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (8.9 +/- 6.0 mm) and cyanotic congenital heart disease (8.5 +/- 6.4 mm) as compared with the patients with bronchogenic carcinoma (6.0 +/- 3.9 mm). Correlation of radiographic patterns with duration of disease confirms that thicker, more extensive alterations are indicative of long-standing disease. The periostitis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is therefore not dependent on the primary or secondary nature of the disease but principally on its duration.\r"

Appreciation of the normal neurovascular anatomy provides a scientific foundation for the detection of disease. Sagittal, axial, and oblique MR images of normal subjects were correlated with comparable anatomic sections obtained with a cryomicrotome whole-organ sectioning technique. The anterior epidural venous plexus is a prominent structure in the cervical spinal canal and was consistently identified both with cryomicrotomy and with MR in sagittal and axial planes. Epidural veins can be displaced and distorted in patients with cervical disk disease. Nerve roots including dorsal and ventral rootlets were consistently identified on axial images coursing through the subarachnoid space. Oblique-plane imaging showed nerve roots \"en face\" in their respective foramina; this may be a useful imaging technique in the diagnosis of nerve root impingement.\r"

  ".W": "The role of MR in evaluating tuberous sclerosis is reviewed in 15 patients. These studies were compared with CT scans, which were available in 14 patients. Four characteristic findings were noted on the MR images obtained. Subependymal nodules projecting into the lateral ventricles were seen in 12 of 15 patients on T1-weighted images. This was the most specific finding. Distortion of the normal cortical architecture was seen in 10 of 11 patients in whom T1-weighted images were obtained using a 256 X 256 matrix. These foci corresponded to multiple cortical areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images. Dilated ventricles were seen in five patients. In one patient, a known astrocytoma showed increased signal on the T2-weighted images, allowing differentiation from a benign subependymal nodule. MR depicted the cortical hamartomas more completely than did CT. The MR scans were abnormal in all cases, and a diagnosis could be confidently made in all 11 cases scanned using a 256 X 256 matrix. Our preliminary experience suggests that MR will at least equal and probably exceed CT, both for sensitivity and specificity, given the use of a 256 X 256 matrix.\r"

Nine patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery, and three of these showed a documented decrease in size of mass on bromocriptine therapy. CT was more sensitive than MR for detecting focal lesions (seven vs three) and sellar-floor erosion (12 vs six). MR was superior to CT in identifying infundibular abnormalities (seven vs six), focal abnormalities of the diaphragma sellae (10 vs seven), cavernous sinus invasion (four vs two), and optic chiasm compression (six vs zero). Thus, MR may be the procedure of choice for optimal identification and localization of macroadenoma. For patients with suspected microadenoma, however, this preliminary series indicates that CT remains the radiographic procedure of choice.\r"

MR was performed on a 1.5 T system, using surface-coil and head-coil techniques. Idiopathic pseudotumor was confirmed in nine patients on the basis of response to steroid therapy in the absence of local cause or systemic illness. One other patient had biopsy-proven idiopathic pseudotumor. Five patients proved to have other orbital entities, including metastases, infectious myositis, hemorrhage, and orbital sarcoid. In all 10 patients with confirmed pseudotumor, CT and MR were abnormal. MR abnormalities in 10 of 10 patients with pseudotumor were hypointense to fat and isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images. On T2-weighted images the lesions of pseudotumor were isointense or only minimally hyperintense to fat in nine of 10 cases; in one case, the enlarged muscle was markedly hyperintense to fat. The MR signal intensity of pseudotumor was similar to that found in infectious myositis and sarcoid. These findings contrasted to the MR appearance of the other disease entities examined. Metastases appeared markedly hyperintense to fat on T2-weighted images, while hematoma was hyperintense to muscle and isointense to fat on T1-weighted images and markedly hyperintense to fat on T2-weighted images. In our preliminary series, surface-coil MR appears to add specificity to the CT appearance of orbital pseudotumor.\r"

Patients 65 years or older made up 15% of the case load during 1984 and 1985 and 21% in 1986. Referrals from neurologists, internists, and neurosurgeons accounted for 56%, 11% and 9% of patients, respectively. The percentage of patients who had CT, myelography, and other imaging procedures performed before referral for MR imaging declined significantly between 1984 and 1986. Indications for examination were mostly neoplastic diseases; degenerative diseases of the CNS, including multiple sclerosis; other disorders of the CNS; and disk diseases. Approximately 40% of all examinations were interpreted as normal. The number of patients referred for degenerative intervertebral disk disorders increased substantially between 1984 and 1985. This study documents the increasing acceptance of MR imaging as an important primary imaging technique for a variety of conditions, particularly those of the brain and spine.\r"

In four of five acute hematomas (those less than 7 days of age), signal intensity was markedly decreased on long TR/TE images and was either intermediate or slightly decreased on short TR/TR images. Fourteen subacute hematomas (7 days to 7 weeks of age) and one chronic hematoma (9 months) were studied. The appearance of the subacute lesions varied from intermediate to high intensity on short TR/TE sequences, but all demonstrated increased signal on long TR/TE sequences. A low-signal rim was noted at the margin of nine subacute lesions. In one patient with this finding, pathologic examination showed that the low-signal margin corresponded to a region containing hemosiderin-laden macrophages at the periphery of the hematoma. These results correlate well with those reported for intracranial hematomas examined at this field strength. We conclude that analysis of signal-intensity patterns at 1.5 T is useful in staging the evolution of hematomas.\r"

There was a total of 27 grafts including 18 aortic or aortofemoral, five femoral-popliteal, two femoral-femoral, and two axillary-femoral reconstructions. Nineteen grafts were uninfected; eight were infected. In the absence of infection, the complications and the percentages detected by the two procedures were as follows: five graft occlusions (CT 80%, angiography 100%), six pseudoaneurysms (CT 100%, angiography 83%), three with perigraft fluid (CT 100%, angiography 0%), and one with pseudointimal hyperplasia (CT 100%, angiography 0%). Seven grafts were normal and without abnormalities on both CT and angiography. In the presence of infection the results were as follows: eight with perigraft fluid (CT 100%, angiography 0%), four with perigraft or intragraft gas (CT 100%, angiography 0%), three pseudoaneurysms (CT 100%, angiography 100%), two open groin wounds (CT 100%, angiography 0%), and two graft occlusions (CT 100%, angiography 100%). In addition, three patients with infected grafts had graft enteric fistulae. All three had fluid around the proximal anastomosis and two had gas around the graft as well. The data show that angiography is sufficient for patients with graft occlusion if there is no suspicion of infection, postoperative hemorrhage, or anastomotic pseudoaneurysm. In these cases CT has an ancillary role in detecting hemorrhage and defining pseudoaneurysms. CT is superior to angiography in patients with graft infection.\r"

Myocardial PET scanning was performed 3 minutes after injection of 13N-ammonia at rest and during exercise. The circumferential profile analysis of resting PET images revealed regional hypoperfusion in 96% of CAD patients with previous myocardial infarction and in 29% of those without infarction. Exercise PET studies showed high sensitivity (93%) in detecting CAD without myocardial infarction, whereas no abnormal hypoperfusion was detected in normal subjects. Segmental analysis of regional myocardial perfusion with exercise stress identified 67 of 75 stenosed vessels (89%). We conclude that 13N-ammonia myocardial PET with exercise loading provides high-quality tomographic images of regional myocardial perfusion and is a valuable technique for detecting CAD.\r"

Two major radionuclide techniques are currently used in evaluating the total ischemic burden in patients with CAD. These are myocardial perfusion imaging with either thallium-201 or rubidium-82, and radionuclide angiography performed after administration of technetium-99m. Areas of diminished thallium-201 activity on early postexercise images are abnormal and represent either areas of stress-induced ischemia or myocardial scar. To differentiate between the two, delayed images are obtained to determine if the initial postexercise defect either persists or demonstrates redistribution (i.e., delayed defect disappearance or improvement). Defects demonstrating redistribution represent transient ischemia, whereas areas of previous infarction or scar usually appear as persistent defects. Patients with left main or 3-vessel CAD usually show multiple thallium-201 redistribution defects in more than 1 vascular supply region, a phenomenon often associated with abnormal lung thallium-201 uptake. In terms of radionuclide angiography, the normal ventricular response to exercise has been defined as an absolute increment of at least 5% in the left ventricular ejection fraction without the development of regional wall motion abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complete right bundle branch block (BBB) was the most frequent type of new ventricular conduction abnormality, followed by left anterior hemiblock and incomplete right BBB (found in 60%, 26%, and 9%, respectively, of all patients with transient changes and 29%, 33% and 26% of all patients with persistent changes). Development of new ventricular conduction abnormalities was most strongly related to date of operation (p less than 0.0001, univariate chi 2 = 122), increasing from 2% transient and 7% persistent in 1976 to 36% transient and 22% persistent in 1981. The incidence was also higher in older patients. Preoperative ejection fraction and number of diseased vessels were related to development of perioperative ventricular conduction abnormalities but were not independently related after adjustment for other baseline characteristics. Contrary to findings in other studies, development of new perioperative ventricular conduction abnormalities, including isolated new left BBB, did not worsen the survival rate in patients followed up to 3 years after surgery.\r"

The taxonomy and classification of P. carinii has not yet been settled. The authors present transmission and scanning electron microscopic (TEM and SEM) observations of tissue from two patients with pulmonary Pneumocystis infections. The infectious organisms display marked variability in shape and size. They appear to divide by binary fission and lack motility organelles, Golgi apparatus, phagosomes, and lysosomes. The mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were poorly developed. The nucleus was rather ill defined, and there appeared to be asynchrony in the development of nuclear membranes and cytoplasm. The authors contend that there are firm ultrastructural evidences against the claim for a protozoan nature of Pneumocystis and in favor of its being a fungus, albeit of a primitive form, in which the mycelium is reduced to a unicellular state but the ability to sporulate is preserved.\r"

Stigmata of variceal bleeding were observed in 76 (92%) including 35 venous spurts, 12 venous oozes, 20 adherent clots, and 14 \"platelet aggregates.\" In only seven cases, variceal rupture could only be presumed, because no other lesion was present. In the other 82 patients, a lesion other than varices was the bleeding source, mostly peptic ulcers (32 = 38%) and erosive gastritis (30 = 36%). One-third of the patients with bleeding varices required more than one endoscopy to provide evidence of variceal bleeding. The most frequent bleeding point was the cardia and a good correlation between variceal size and bleeding was observed. There was no relationship with evidence of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Kaposi's sarcoma as a complication of AIDS occurred mainly in homosexuals (17 of 42 homosexuals, one of 17 drug abusers, one of five heterosexually promiscuous patients, and one of six patients who had previously received transfusions). The high-grade lymphomas did not show a predilection for any particular AIDS risk group. Three of four solid tumors arose in elderly AIDS patients. Twenty-five of 75 patients with CDC-defined AIDS had a neoplastic disorder (26 are still alive and may yet demonstrate malignancy).

The manifestations of storage disease are variable and include granulomatous colitis, restrictive lung disease, kidney failure, and cardiomyopathy. The autofluorescent material stored in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is histochemically similar to that stored in neuronal ceroid/lipofuscinosis. The material in neuronal ceroid/lipofuscinosis contains dolichols, which are components of lysosomes, and patients show increased urinary excretion of dolichols. This study of 49 patients with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome found that urinary dolichol levels are increased in those patients with evidence of ceroid storage in the kidneys but are not elevated when storage occurs in tissues other than the kidneys. The excretion of ceroid was not influenced by the saturation state of dietary fat. A defect in processing of membranes of lysosomes, melanosomes, and dense bodies may be involved in the syndrome.\r"

Among the homosexual men, cytomegalovirus seropositivity was associated with increased T8 lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) and reduced T4/T8 ratios (p = 0.006); these results were independent of HIV infection. Cytomegalovirus seropositivity was also associated with increasing age, numbers of sexual partners, and the practice of anal-receptive intercourse. At the first visit, cytomegalovirus was isolated from none of 13 cytomegalovirus-seropositive heterosexual subjects, compared with 62 (36 percent) of 171 seropositive homosexual men (p less than 0.005). Viral isolation was most common from semen. Among 32 cytomegalovirus-seropositive homosexual subjects from whom culture specimens were obtained more than four times over 10 to 30 months, 72 percent of the specimens were culture-positive. The mean duration of cytomegalovirus excretion in semen was 22 months, and in urine, the duration was nine months. Cytomegalovirus excretion was associated with younger age and reduced lymphocyte proliferation in response to cytomegalovirus, but not with antibody to HIV. Cytomegalovirus infection is sexually transmitted among homosexual men, perhaps by rectal intercourse, and is associated with alterations in T lymphocyte subsets. Most seropositive homosexual men excrete cytomegalovirus intermittently, primarily in the semen.\r"

Successful pregnancies have been correlated with the presence of decidua-associated suppressor cells. Supernatants from these cells were tested for their ability to suppress the proliferation of interleukin 2-dependent cells and were also subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography. Decidual supernatant was found to have peak suppressive activity at two molecular weights (43,000 and 21,000 daltons). The activity of decidual supernatant was directed specifically at interleukin 2-dependent cells and interfered with interleukin 2 action. The importance of this mechanism in graft rejection is well known. Decidual supernatant may thus prevent fetal allograft rejection by preventing the maternal cytotoxic effectors from receiving the interleukin 2-dependent help that they need to proliferate and remain actively cytolytic.\r"

It has been suggested that defective fibrinolysis may occur in pregnancy, but this defect has been poorly characterized. In the present study of 52 women with normal pregnancies and 56 nonpregnant control women, we found a marked change in levels of releasable tissue plasminogen activator in pregnant women beginning in the first trimester. Whereas nonpregnant women demonstrated releasable levels of tissue plasminogen activator of 0.74 +/- 0.15 IU/ml of plasma, in the pregnant women the amount released was only 0.06 +/- 0.02 IU/ml of plasma (p less than 0.01). These levels were observed beginning in the first trimester. Levels of the recently described fast-acting tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor increased significantly throughout pregnancy. Values ranged from 8.40 +/- 0.27 IU/ml of plasma in the first trimester to 9.92 +/- 0.09 IU/ml of plasma in the third trimester (p less than 0.05) compared with the level of 8.46 +/- 0.19 IU/ml of plasma in nonpregnant subjects. These data suggest that alterations both in releasable tissue plasminogen activator and in the fast-acting tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor contribute to the physiologic hypercoagulable state of pregnancy.\r"

Two preparations of human chorionic gonadotropin extracted from pregnancy urine were used, one highly purified (National Institutes of Health, CR-121) and one less pure (Sigma). Thymidine incorporation was increased twofold to tenfold in cultures exposed to the Sigma human chorionic gonadotropin preparation or to mouse epidermal growth factor as compared to control. Pure National Institutes of Health human chorionic gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone had no effect on growth. When adrenocorticotropin was added alone or in combination with Sigma human chorionic gonadotropin or mouse epidermal growth factor, growth was decreased. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate production was stimulated by adrenocorticotropin but not by human luteinizing hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, or mouse epidermal growth factor. These results suggest that human pregnancy urine contains a growth factor which remains to be identified but that pure human chorionic gonadotropin has no mitogenic or steroidogenic effects on the cultured fetal zone cells of the human fetal adrenal gland.\r"

Mean maximum number of available binding sites of term placentas from male fetuses (330 +/- 110 fmol/mg protein; n = 11) was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than that of female fetuses (170 +/- 80 fmol/mg protein, n = 13). Occupation of epidermal growth factor receptors by endogenous epidermal growth factor could not account for the difference in levels of epidermal growth factor binding. Kendall's rank order correlation test demonstrated a significant positive correlation of the gestational age in weeks with the maximum number of epidermal growth factor receptors in placentas from male fetuses (p less than 0.002; T = 0.527; n = 17) and female fetuses (p less than 0.01; T = 0.404; n = 18).

This virus has remarkable similarities to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Subsequent studies of simian infection with SIV have shown it to be a relevant animal model for studying the pathogenesis of AIDS in man. In both HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected monkeys, a cutaneous maculopapular eruption has been described. To date, the pathogenesis and possible relationship of these exanthema to the evolution of systemic immunosuppression have remained obscure. In this study, the mononuclear cell infiltrates that characterize skin rashes of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys were found to be composed predominantly of cells with phenotypic characteristics of cytotoxic/suppressor (T8+) lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Many of these cells expressed membrane-bound interleukin-2 receptor molecules. Double labeling and immunoelectron microscopy revealed these cells in direct contact with degenerative Langerhans cells within the epidermis and dermis. These observations suggest that the cutaneous rash associated with SIV infection may be the consequence of target cell injury of Langerhans cells by effector cells with cytotoxic potential.\r"

AAT isolated from the plasma of GalNH2-treated rats contains 2-3 fewer moles of sialic acid, 3 fewer moles of neutral sugar, and 2 fewer moles of amino sugar per mole of antiprotease than AAT isolated from controls. AP2 from GalNH2-treated rats contains 1 fewer mole each of sialic acid, neutral sugar, and amino sugar per mole of antiprotease than AP2 from controls. These alterations are similar to those seen in humans with genetically determined alpha 1-antiprotease deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of extravascular tissue plasminogen activator activity (PA) and those of inhibitors of PA and of urokinase (UK) present within the anterior chamber of normal and inflamed feline eyes were assessed with the use of a direct PA assay of microsamples of aqueous humor. Purposes of the study were, first, to confirm prior indirect evidence that this extravascular space normally contains higher levels of uninhibited PA, but lower levels of inhibitor activity, than does plasma and, second, to determine patterns of change in these activities under in vivo conditions imposed by a chronic mycobacterial-induced uveitis (CMIU) disease model. The PA assay utilized a 125I-plasminogen substrate whose cleavage by PA contained in samples was both visualized during gel electrophoreis, and quantified by gamma counting. The results provided the first direct evidence that the higher fibrinolytic activity previously observed in normal aqueous in comparison with plasma is in fact associated with higher levels of available (uninhibited) PA (P less than 0.01) The data also indicated that normal aqueous contains a much higher level of PA inhibitor activity than previously suspected--roughly 40 times more than available PA levels. These normal values for PA and inhibitors occupied a relatively narrow, threefold range, in contrast to the wide scattering of individual values that appeared during 18-20 weeks of the chronic inflammation disease model. Despite this, however, the general pattern of observation for all individual eyes during CMIU was a significant increase in levels of both PA and inhibitors. The net effect of CMIU was thus to cause the 1:40 ratio noted above to be tilted more strongly in favor of inhibitor activity, ie, up to 1:80. Increases in local vasopermeability in this disease model were believed contributory to this change. However, local generations of PA and APA in vivo by inflammatory cells, especially monocyte-macrophages, must also be considered. Assays for UK inhibitor showed levels of activity and directions of change that closely followed those of PA inhibitor, which suggests the possibility that they may be identical. It is surmised that the above patterns, along with results of our prior studies, indicate an apparent need for a multistep, strict inhibitory control of plasmin generation and proteolysis in vivo within normal extravascular spaces such as the anterior chamber.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

DNA extracted from the lesions of 3 patients with PLEVA was analyzed for rearrangement of beta-T-cell receptor genes for the purpose of assessing the clonality of T lymphocytes within the tissues of this disease. Lesions from all 3 cases showed clonal gene rearrangements. In each of 2 cases from which two separate lesions were biopsied, identical rearrangements were found in specimens from both sites. DNA from a variety of inflammatory lesions obtained from patients with other types of skin diseases failed to show detectable rearrangements of beta-T-cell receptor genes. These results suggest that PLEVA represents a T-cell lymphoproliferative process, rather than an inflammatory disorder, as had been previously thought.\r"

This study reveals several immunopathologic changes induced in the thymic medulla by CsA (15 mg/kg/day). The weight and relative size of the thymus dramatically and rapidly involutes, with marked changes observed in 1 week. The medullary thymocytes show segregation of rat T-cell phenotypes as seen in control rats, but the number of such cells is markedly reduced in accordance with the medullary remnant. This is consistent with a maturational arrest of thymocytes. The medullary epithelium was assessed directly by irradiating the control or CsA-treated rats 2 days prior to sacrifice. The epithelium of Hassall's corpuscles was essentially absent in CsA-treated rats but prominent in control rats. The cortical epithelial cells were preserved. Stains for Ia antigen with the anti-OX4 antibody show little change in expression by cortical epithelium, but a marked reduction in the Ia+ medullary cells in the thymocyte purged rats. All of these changes were reversible in the normal rat after cessation of CsA, with near normal recovery in 3 weeks. No morphologic or immunopathologic changes were noted in the cortical thymocytes. These cells did, however, acquire CsA receptors, as detected by the binding of fluorescent dansylated CsA.\r"

We investigated the relation between tobacco use and several anthropometric measurements in 12,103 men and women 19-74 years of age in the United States examined between 1976 and 1980 during the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). Cigarette smokers weighed less (mean +/- standard error = 69.8 +/- 0.2 kg) and were leaner (body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) = 24.6 +/- 0.1) than nonsmokers (72.5 +/- 0.2 kg and 25.7 +/- 0.1, respectively), controlling for age and sex. Body leanness increased with the duration (but not intensity) of smoking. Ex-smokers were not heavier or fatter than nonsmokers, and these groups experienced similar weight gain after age 25 (approximately 6 kg in men, 9 kg in women), while current smokers gained substantially less weight (3.5 kg in men, 5.4 kg in women). Compared to nonsmokers, former and current smokers were also slightly taller. Most of these associations were evident in both sexes and all ages evaluated, and were not explained by differences in caloric intake, physical activity, illness, or socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest that the increased mortality observed among lean individuals in previous studies may have been due to smoking rather than leanness per se, and that as a result, currently accepted desirable body weights may be overestimated.\r"

The subject, a 35-yr-old lifetime non-smoker with moderate emphysema, has been characterized as having alpha 1AT serum levels of zero resulting from the homozygous inheritance of alpha 1AT genes that do not express detectable alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts. Evaluation of the antineutrophil elastase capacity of the null-null serum showed it was less than 5% of normal, whereas that of the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract was 13% of normal. However, after 60 mg/kg of intravenously administered alpha 1AT augmentation therapy once weekly for 4 wk, the serum alpha 1AT levels peaked at greater than 300 mg/dl, trough levels just prior to the next infusion were 81 +/- 2 mg/dl, and the average serum level integrated for the month of infusions was 138 mg/dl. Consistent with this serum rise in alpha 1AT, the serum antineutrophil elastase capacity increased in parallel(r = 0.98). Importantly, evaluation of the ELF 2 and 6 days after infusion demonstrated increases of alpha 1AT levels (range, 1.4 to 2.1 microM) and antineutrophil elastase capacity (range, 1.6 to 2.5 microM), values within the lower range of normal. Furthermore, the lung ELF alpha 1AT levels rose in direct proportion to the serum alpha 1AT levels, and the ELF antineutrophil elastase capacity rose in direct proportion to the ELF alpha 1AT levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The AM were able to promote the T-cell proliferative response to antigen, but they did so less effectively than did the BM. Density-fractionated AM were heterogeneous in their ability to support T-cell responses. More proliferation occurred with the densest AM than with the least dense AM. In contrast to antigen-induced responses, mitogen-induced responses were supported more effectively by AM and density-fractionated AM than by BM. The ability of AM, density-fractionated AM, and BM to support T-cell responses did not correlate with surface expression of class II major histocompatibility determinants. Addition of purified IL-1 resulted in a partial restoration of T-cell proliferation when low-density AM were used but no augmentation when unfractionated AM were used. This suggests that reduced IL-1 activity may partially explain the decreased ability of low density AM to promote T-cell responses, but that other processes may also contribute to differences in accessory cell function among AM, BM, and density-fractionated AM.\r"

Widespread depression of cerebral glucose metabolism was apparent 24 hours after drug administration, which may reflect reduced glucose phosphorylation, and the influx rate constant for 82Rb was increased, indicating a drug-induced alteration in blood-brain barrier function. Associated changes in neuropsychological performance, electroencephalogram, and plasma amino acid concentration were identified in the absence of evidence of systemic methotrexate toxicity, suggesting primary methotrexate neurotoxicity.\r"

In a cross-sectional study, free levels of MBP correlated with those of free anti-MBP, and bound MBP levels correlated with those of bound anti-MBP in both groups of patients with active disease. However, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis were characterized by higher free MBP and anti-MBP levels with lower levels of bound fractions. Conversely, patients with progressing disease had higher titers of bound than free fractions. Longitudinal studies of individual patients confirmed the association of higher titers of free anti-MBP with acute exacerbations and higher levels of bound anti-MBP with chronic progressing disease.\r"

Six (67%) of the nine patients with leg ulcers had HLA-B35 and each of these six patients also had HLA-Cw4. In contrast, only eight (28%) of the 29 control patients with SS had HLA-B35 and only three (10%) of these patients had both HLA-B35 and Cw4. The relative risk for development of leg ulcers in patients with SS who had both HLA-B35 and Cw4 was 17 times greater than that of patients without these antigens or who had only one antigen. The frequency of HLA-B35 was also significantly higher in patients with SS and leg ulcers than in a reference population (31%) consisting of 68 healthy black persons. These results suggest that genetic factors or an HLA-related altered immune response may contribute to the development of leg ulcers in sickle cell anemia.\r"

Results with the Starr-Edwards Silastic ball valve (Oregon) and the Hancock (Stanford) and Carpentier-Edwards (Vancouver) porcine valves are compared using this new definition of treatment failure. Evaluated according to structural failure, the mechanical valve is superior to the tissue valve, and using the Stanford definition of valve failure, it becomes so between 5 and 10 years. Using treatment failure, tissue valves are superior at 5 years; at 10 years in the aortic position, the results are comparable; and in the mitral position at 8 to 10 years, tissue valves show a continued but small advantage.\r"

Findings on chest roentgenograms included large thin-walled cavitarylike lesions, multiple cavitary lesions, or pneumothorax. These presentations of the infection have not been previously described, and the mechanisms for lung tissue damage are as yet unknown. Cavitary lung disease found on chest roentgenograms in patients should not exclude the diagnosis of P carinii pneumonia, and patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presenting with pneumothorax should have the possibility of P carinii infection included in the differential diagnosis.\r"

These patients were compared with 14 normal controls and 14 patients with unipolar depression. The patients with unipolar depression and OCD did not differ in levels of anxiety, tension, or depression. In OCD, metabolic rates were significantly increased in the left orbital gyrus and bilaterally in the caudate nuclei. This was apparent on all statistical comparisons with both controls and unipolar depression. The right orbital gyrus showed at least a trend to an increased metabolic rate in all comparisons. The metabolic rate in the left orbital gyrus, relative to that in the ipsilateral hemisphere (orbital gyrus/hemisphere ratio), was significantly elevated compared to controls and subjects with unipolar depression, and stayed high even with successful drug treatment. Though it was in the normal range in the morbid state, with improvement in OCD symptoms after drug treatment, the caudate/hemisphere metabolic ratio increased uniformly and significantly bilaterally. This ratio did not increase in patients who did not respond to treatment. Thus, OCD showed cerebral glucose metabolic patterns that differed from controls in both the symptomatic and recovered states.\r"

Absolute caudate metabolic rates and normalized indexes of caudate metabolism for at-risk persons were normal compared with controls. No at-risk person had caudate indexes outside two SDs of the controls' mean. Caudate metabolism in the earliest HD cases was significantly reduced compared with controls and at-risk persons, but within the 99% confidence levels of both groups. Stage II patients had caudate measures that were significantly depressed compared with those of stage I HD patients. Measurement of caudate glucose hypometabolism is unlikely to be sufficiently sensitive to serve as a presymptomatic marker of heterozygote status, although it will provide a sensitive marker for progressive caudate dysfunction in HD.\r"

We found that all subjects with AD demonstrated flow deficits in temporoparietal cortex bilaterally, and that the ratio of activity in bilateral temporoparietal cortex to activity in the whole slice allowed the differentiation of all patients with AD from both the controls and from the patients with multi-infarct dementia. Furthermore, this ratio showed a strong correlation with disease severity in the AD group.

  ".W": "Cyclophosphamide was administered to 14 patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis on an intermittent escalating dosage schedule adjusted to maintain numbers of peripheral blood B lymphocytes and helper/inducer (CD4) T cells below the fifth percentile of the normal population. Peripheral blood B cells, T cells, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8) T cells, CD4 cells, and FcR+-bearing cell numbers and percentages were monitored at one-week to two-week intervals. Clinical status was assessed by neurologic examinations at approximately four-week intervals. Regression analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between changes in immunologic status and changes in clinical state. The immunologic changes preceded the neurologic changes. Increases in percent of CD8 cells and decreases in percent of CD4 cells forecast improved clinical course. These findings, coupled with other studies, strongly suggest a pathogenetic role for helper and suppressor T cells in the production of clinical signs of multiple sclerosis.\r"

To investigate this functional defect, RA SF were examined for the presence of inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-2. A factor was found which inhibited the IL-2-induced proliferation of mitogen-stimulated human T cells and the IL-1-induced proliferation of C3H/Hej mouse thymocytes, but not IL-1-induced fibroblast proliferation. On AcA 54 Ultrogel filtration, the inhibitory activity resided in a fraction with an apparent molecular weight of greater than 70 kd and a major pI of 6.8. The inhibitory effect of RA SF on lymphocyte proliferation was partially corrected with IL-2, but not with IL-1. In the presence of RA SF, normal lymphocytes showed not only a decreased response to exogenous IL-2, but also a decreased production of IL-2. The presence of an inhibitor of IL-2 in RA SF could contribute to the IL-2-related T cell defects observed in RA.\r"

We used both 3H-double-stranded DNA and 3H-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Generally, double-stranded DNA IC showed considerably higher binding than did ssDNA IC in the RBC binding assay. Further analysis indicated that although ssDNA IC fix complement, it is necessary that these IC contain IgM anti-DNA antibodies in order for them to bind to RBC. The results suggest that the mechanisms of clearance and pathogenic potential of these IC may depend upon both the DNA conformation and antibody class. In particular, complement-fixing IC which contain IgG anti-DNA antibodies and ssDNA may not be cleared via the erythrocyte clearance mechanism, and therefore, could be more likely to deposit in certain tissues and initiate inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".U": "87158055\r", 
  ".W": "Purified preparations of normal C1(-)-inhibitor (C1(-)-INH) formed high mol wt complexes with plasma kallikrein that were stable during sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis, but most of the dysfunctional C1(-)-INH proteins isolated from plasma of patients with type II hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) did not. Two of eight dysfunctional C1(-)-INH proteins were cleaved to lower mol wt forms that were not seen following the reaction of normal C1(-)-INH with equimolar amounts, or less, of plasma kallikrein. Only the higher mol wt component of normal C1(-)-INH (106,000 mol wt) appeared to form a stable complex with the plasma kallikrein, whereas both the 106,000 and 96,000 mol wt forms made stable complexes with C1-s. When a preparation of normal C1(-)-INH containing a homogeneous single band of C1(-)-INH was exposed to C1-s or kallikrein, a \"doublet\" form evolved in which the heaviest band was in the original position of native C1(-)-INH; C1-s cleavage provided a second band of 96,000; and cleavage by kallikrein, a second band of 94,000 mol wt. We conclude that dysfunctional C1(-)-INH proteins from plasma of persons with type II hereditary angioneurotic edema have impaired interactions with plasma kallikrein and are heterogeneous with respect to these interactions. Moreover, the requirements for the formation of stable complexes between normal C1(-)-INH and plasma kallikrein differed from those for stable complex formation with C1-s. The doublet form of C1(-)-INH, which purified preparations frequently demonstrate, may be due to prior cleavage by C1-s or kallikrein.\r"

  ".W": "Weekly medium change or midweek feeding of long-term bone marrow cultures (LTMBCs) results in a significant increase in total myeloid cell production. Proliferative myeloid cells peak 48 hours after feeding, and nonproliferative myeloid cells reach maximum levels at 72 hours. This increase in myelopoiesis is invariably preceded by a significant elevation in biologically and immunologically measurable colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in the supernatants of LTBMC. The level peaks 24 hours after medium change, then gradually returns to basal values. The decrease in CSF relates to its consumption by generating myeloid precursors because no fluctuation in the levels occur in cultures without active myelopoiesis. No significant inhibitors or promoters of CSF were detected. When highly purified L cell CSF, CSF in lung-conditioned medium, or CSF concentrated from LTBMC supernatant is added to cultures, an identical increase in myelopoiesis occurs. Anti-CSF antiserum, added to culture at the time of medium change, totally neutralizes supernatant CSF levels but does not affect myelopoiesis. These findings suggest a potential regulatory role for CSF in myelopoiesis in LTBMC. CSF appears to function within the microenvironment through a mechanism involving cell:cell interactions or by causing the production of other substances that stimulate myelopoiesis. Because exogenous CSF stimulates myelopoiesis, it is likely that it too can react either directly or through microenvironmental cells to stimulate primitive myeloid cells to divide.\r"

Changes in urodynamic measurements were evaluated when the patients themselves reported cure or significant improvement. The duration of the treatment was 9 to 20 h/day for at least 2 months (mean 9 months). According to the patients' subjective evaluation, 71% were cured of their incontinence and 29% were markedly improved. In motor urge and mixed incontinence a significant increase in bladder volume at first sensation and at maximum cystometric capacity was found, and 45% of these patients had a normal, stable bladder after treatment. A significant increase in functional urethral length was observed in patients who had had stress incontinence, but the measured increase in maximum urethral pressure was not significant. Of the 16 patients with stress and mixed incontinence who reported cure, 15 had a positive urethral closure pressure during coughing after treatment. Urodynamic analysis confirmed the positive clinical effect observed after electrostimulation therapy. It is recommended as primary therapy in stress, motor urge and mixed stress and motor urge incontinence in women.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of squamous head and neck cancer, the pretreatment peripheral blood of 125 patients was examined for lymphocyte subclass and in vitro immunologic function. After 4 years of follow-up, 49 recurrences of disease were observed. Lymphocytes from patients with recurrent disease showed elevated interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and a tendency towards increased response to mitogens in comparison to those without recurrence. When disease-free survival is analyzed on the basis of IL-2 levels, patients with high relative IL-2 synthesis (greater than or equal to 1) had a 40% poorer prognosis than patients with low relative IL-2 levels (less than 1). The difference is significant at a P value of 0.02. Since IL-2 synthesis occurs with antigenic stimulation, it is postulated that patients who have a high IL-2 synthesis in their pretreatment lymphocytes may have had prior stimulation by circulating tumor antigen. Such immune response by the host may be successful in destroying the antigenic tumor cells but may leave the undifferentiated, less antigenic tumor cells to grow and metastasize. Thus, elevated IL-2 synthesis in pretreatment lymphocytes predicts a poorer prognosis.\r"

Only 55% of the cases originally diagnosed as NHL were regarded as such at reexamination. The others were mainly malignant nonlymphatic tumors such as neuroblastoma and different kinds of sarcomas. Seventy-two NHLs were diagnosed in 50 boys and 22 girls. The corrected age-specific incidence rate was 0.32/10(5). The most common histologic types were Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) (30 cases), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) (26), large cell lymphomas (LCL) (six), and non-Burkitt's lymphoma (n-BL) (three). There were marked differences between BL and LBL in the course of the disease: BL was extranodal in 83%, LBL only in 4% (mediastinum was regarded as nodal); BL showed initial abdominal or pelvic involvement in 60% whereas LBL showed none; BL had initial mediastinal involvement in 7%, and LBL had it in 62%; all patients with LBL died whereas 23% of those with BL survived. Other types of NHL resembled BL in their course of disease. Patients with initial tonsillary involvement appeared to have the best prognosis and patients with mediastinal involvement the poorest. The importance of accurate histologic classification is emphasized. It appears to be most important to differentiate LBL from other types of NHL.\r"

The hypercalcemia was associated with high circulating concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (235 pmol/l) and both abnormalities were corrected with treatment. A lymph node was excised before treatment and was incubated in vitro with either labeled or unlabeled 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. After purification of the extract and chromatography on three different HPLC systems, material comigrating with authentic 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was identified. This was shown to bind to a specific chick intestinal cytosol receptor and to dilute in parallel with synthetic 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the receptor binding assay. In conclusion, hypercalcemia in malignant B-cell lymphoma can be due to extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by lymphomatous tissue.\r"

Sixty patients received induction doses of propofol (2.5 mg X kg-1) and 30 patients received thiopentone (4 mg X kg-1). Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide plus additional doses of the agent used for induction. Comparisons were made regarding the efficacy of induction and maintenance, rapidity of recovery, haemodynamic and respiratory variables and side effects. The number of \"excellent\" inductions was significantly different (p = 0.02), with 97 per cent of the patients induced with propofol and 80 per cent of the patients induced with thiopentone receiving this rating. A larger number of patients receiving propofol exhibited minor extraneous muscular movement during induction (p = 0.01). Recovery for the propofol group was significantly more rapid than with the thiopentone group (p = 0.001). The respiratory effect of the two drugs was not significantly different. Propofol caused a decrease in pulse rate and a decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean pressure which were significantly greater than with thiopentone. From the observations made we conclude that propofol has the potential to be an excellent induction and maintenance agent for outpatient surgery in combination with nitrous oxide alone.\r"

In so far as this represents a quality which is as likely to be achieved as is the alchemist's dream of turning lead into gold, a compromise approach is recommended. It is suggested that all extracorporeal or body invasive procedures stimulate the inflammatory defense mechanism of the body by stimulating the monocyte to produce a family of polypeptides currently known collectively as Interleukin-1 (IL-1). So far two dissimilar gene products have been cloned and there are probably more. The IL-1 group of polypeptides possess hormonal functions which orchestrate nearly every instrument of the body's defense system. Inducers of IL-1 are present in dialysate and include bacterial pyrogen and acetate. In addition bacterial cell wall glycoprotein may be cleaved into muramyl dipeptides by the release of granulocyte lysozyme at the membrane interface. Muramyl dipeptides have been found in CAPD drain fluid and are more potent inducers of IL-1 than endotoxin. Membrane activation of the fifth component of complement with the release of C5a will also induce monocytes to produce IL-1. The consequences of repeated stimulation of the acute phase response are undesirable and may include muscle wasting, osteopenia and bone cysts (Shrinking man syndrome), fibrosis of scapulo-humeral joints and the carpal-tunnel syndrome. These latter lesions are often associated with deposition of amyloid fibrils related to beta 2 microglobulin. Efforts to reduce these complications are urgently required.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Deep flexor tendons of rabbits were excised, transected, repaired, and grown in an acellular culture medium for seven, 14, 21, or 42 days. Tendons through which a continuous 7-microAmp current was passed at the repair site were compared with nonstimulated controls. The incorporation of (14C)proline and its conversion to (14C)hydroxyproline was measured at seven days. The mean (14C)proline and (14C)hydroxyproline activities were 91% and 255% greater, respectively, in the stimulated group. The activity was also higher in the stimulated group, by 42 days. Histologic sections showed that intrinsic tenoblastic repair may be enhanced with electrical stimulation in vitro.\r"

Anal sphincter resting pressures (35 +/- 14 mmHg) and squeeze pressures (88 +/- 24.2 mmHg) were similar to those of a healthy population, with the exception of one patient's complaint of nocturnal mucous leakage per anus. Biopsies of the ileal mucosa of the reservoirs showed a mild inflammation in seven patients; in one a subtotal villous atrophy (plus glandular pattern) was found. Anthropometric measurements, lymphocyte counts, hemoglobin, albumin, transferrin, iron, B12, and folate were normal in all. In the majority of patients there was no evidence of bacterial overgrowth. Vitamin B12 absorption was reduced slightly in only one patient. Lipid absorption (as judged by the 14C-Triolein breath test) was abnormal in three patients. Fecal clearance of alpha 1 antitrypsin as protein losses index was abnormal in three patients. Bile acid malabsorption was the most important ileal dysfunction observed in the patients.\r"

Neither hCalc nor hCGRP significantly altered plasma gastrin concentrations compared to control values. Truncal vagotomy did not prevent the gastric inhibitory actions of hCalc and hCGRP. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine completely abolished the gastric inhibitory action of hCalc but had no effect on gastric acid inhibition induced by hCGRP. The results of this study indicate that intracerebroventricular administration of hCalc and hCGRP inhibits meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in awake dogs. Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by hCalc and hCGRP in the dog is not mediated by inhibition of gastrin release or by the vagus nerves. Human Calc but not human CGRP appears to inhibit meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in the dog by activation of the autonomic (sympathetic) nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The local pigeon crop-sac assay was used to test the direct effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and several other growth factors and hormones on the growth of mucosal epithelial cells in vivo. Insulin, relaxin, multiplication-stimulating activity, proinsulin, and platelet-derived or fibroblast growth factors had no direct stimulatory activity by themselves. Human insulin-like growth factor I and EGF caused dose-related stimulation, but were less effective than ovine (o) PRL. Insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and multiplication-stimulating activity did not affect the proliferative response to oPRL when injected along with the hormone. Proinsulin augmented the direct mitogenic action of oPRL, but not that of EGF. When EGF was injected locally with PRL no interaction occurred even though both hormones were independently mitogenic. A single sc injection of a high dose of oPRL (0.5 mg) given at a site distant from the crop-sac had no effect on the mucosal epithelial cells, but it caused a significant increase in their response to the direct action of oPRL. However, the systemically acting PRL did not affect the direct local effect of EGF. The gross pattern of mucosal cell proliferation induced by PRL (parallel ridges resembling gastric rugae) differed from that produced by EGF (usually irregular patches), and PRL, but not EGF, promoted the accumulation of lipid droplets in the stimulated mucosal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the crop mucosal cells in the midline of the organ are unresponsive to PRL, but were highly responsive to EGF. These results indicate that although EGF and PRL are both mitogenic to crop mucosal epithelial cells, the former does not mimic the latter. They produce a different growth pattern, and EGF fails to promote differentiation of the resultant daughter cells. Moreover, EGF is a less specific mitogen than is PRL, and the two hormones do not interact in their mitogenic effects.\r"

  ".W": "Palytoxin, a nonphorbol ester-type tumor promoter, stimulated the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and bone resorption in neonatal mouse calvariae in organ culture. The action of palytoxin on bone resorption occurred at extraordinarily low concentrations; enhanced resorption was regularly observed at 0.5 pg/ml, and the ED50 was 1-2 pg/ml (approximately 3 X 10(-13) M). Palytoxin-induced formation of PGE2 and bone resorption were inhibited completely by indomethacin (200 ng/ml). Concentrations of palytoxin above 10 pg/ml led to progressively decreasing enhancement of bone resorption; by 100-250 pg/ml no stimulation of resorption was observed despite continued high production of PGE2. Treatment with high concentrations of palytoxin (100 or 250 pg/ml) for 24-72 h inhibited cAMP accumulation stimulated by exogenous PGE2 or PTH and inhibited bone resorption induced by PGE2, PTH, or an analog of cAMP. Thus, palytoxin exhibited a biphasic dose-response curve for enhanced bone resorption, with stimulation at low concentrations (0.5-10 pg/ml) and toxic inhibition at high concentrations (greater than 50 pg/ml). Palytoxin is one of the most potent stimulators of bone resorption yet identified.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism of this hormonal interaction, the present study examined the effect of PRL on cytosol and nuclear androgen receptors in the three prostate lobes. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated, given 5-mm Silastic implants of testosterone, and either grafted with two anterior pituitary glands under the kidney capsule or sham operated. Three weeks later, animals were killed, serum was collected for PRL and testosterone RIA, and the ventral, dorsal, and lateral prostate lobes were processed for either cytosol or nuclear androgen receptor quantitation. Pituitary grafts significantly elevated the serum PRL concentration and increased the weight and the content of protein and DNA of the lateral prostate lobe compared to control values. There was no effect on these parameters in the ventral or dorsal lobes. Androgen receptor levels and apparent distributions were different in the ventral, dorsal, and lateral lobes of control animals. Unoccupied and total cytosolic androgen receptors in the three separate prostate lobes were not significantly affected by the presence of the grafts. However, an elevated PRL concentration was associated with an increase (P less than 0.005) in nuclear androgen receptor content in the lateral lobe exclusively. The binding affinity was not altered by pituitary grafts in any of the lobes. These findings suggest that PRL promotes lateral prostatic growth by increasing nuclear androgen receptor levels in that tissue and, thus, optimizes its response to circulating testosterone.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory actions of CRF during the neuroendocrine response to stress are mediated by specific receptors within the nervous system and the anterior pituitary gland. Glucocorticoids exert negative feedback inhibition on ACTH secretion by interacting at the pituitary corticotrophs and the central nervous system. To determine whether glucocorticoids influence ACTH secretion by regulating the concentration of CRF receptor sites, binding of [125I]Tyr-oCRF to pituitary and brain membrane-rich particles was studied after glucocorticoid treatment. Corticosterone administration (0.5-150 mg/day) for 1-4 days in adult male rats caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of CRF receptors in the anterior pituitary in parallel with the reduction in ACTH secretion. In the brain, binding studies in membrane-rich fractions or by autoradiography in slide-mounted frozen sections revealed no changes in CRF receptors in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, septal area, and olfactory bulb, although circulating corticosterone levels were higher than during stress. The selective down-regulation of anterior pituitary CRF receptors after corticosterone administration, without alterations in brain CRF receptors, is similar to the change in CRF receptors previously reported after adrenalectomy and indicates that receptor regulatory mechanisms in secretory cells differ from those in neural tissue. Furthermore, the decrease in pituitary CRF receptors after physiological increases in circulating glucocorticoids may contribute to the inhibitory effects of adrenal steroids on ACTH secretion.\r"

In addition to numerous collagen bundles in the Disse space, electron microscopy also revealed the presence of hemopoietic cells, the transformation of perisinusoidal cells into fibroblasticlike or myofibroblasticlike cells, or both, and fragmentary deposits of basement membrane-like material. In the pathogenesis of sinusoidal hypertension as it occurs in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, all the factors mentioned above should probably be taken into consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) inhibits gastric acid secretion via both central neural and peripheral mechanisms. We examined whether local gastric factors may mediate the peripheral action of CRF. In pylorus-ligated anesthetized rats, CRF infusion (15 nmol/kg X h) produced roughly 60% inhibition of pentagastrin (16 micrograms/kg X h)-stimulated acid secretion. Similarly, in the gastric fistula dog, CRF (1 nmol/kg X h) inhibited pentagastrin-induced acid secretion by 74%. This action of CRF did not result from direct inhibition of gastric parietal cells, as concentrations of the peptide ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-6) M had no effect on the activity of isolated parietal cells in the unstimulated state or after stimulation with pentagastrin (10(-8) M), histamine (10(-5) M), or carbachol (10(-5) M), against a background of isobutylmethylxanthine (10(-4) M). To determine whether local hormones may mediate CRF-induced acid inhibition, we examined the peptide's effect on the release of somatostatin and gastrin from cultured canine gastric D and G cells and from isolated perfused rat stomachs. Corticotropin releasing factor in doses ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-6) M had no influence on release of either gastric peptide under basal conditions or after stimulation of gastrin with carbachol (10(-6) M) and somatostatin with isoproterenol (10(-8) M). These data suggest that the peripheral acid inhibitory action of CFR is mediated by nongastric mechanisms.\r"

In canine models we determined the ability to coagulate arteries of varying size and depth. The most effective method for coagulation of medium size arteries was first to occlude the vessel by compression, then to apply heat to seal it (coaptive coagulation). For the contact probes (monopolar, bipolar, and heater probes), the depth of tissue coagulation was controlled by varying probe appositional force and energy, and coagulation of deep arteries was possible. Undesirable erosion of tissue and vessels was noted with electrical sparking from the monopolar electrode and with YAG laser at high power density. In contrast, heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation did not produce tissue erosion at any instrument setting. In this comparative study of arterial coagulation, overall ranking was as follows: heater probe = bipolar electrocoagulation greater than monopolar electrocoagulation greater than neodymium:YAG laser greater than electrofulguration greater than control. In our opinion these data should assist the clinician or investigator who plans to coagulate arterial bleeding lesions such as peptic ulcers, although further clinical research will be needed to verify these experimental results.\r"

In 4 patients clinical evidence of chronic inflammatory bowel disease was absent but 1 of the 4 was found to have microscopic colitis in colonoscopic biopsy specimens. Biopsies were not performed in the remaining 3 patients. High immunoglobulin G concentrations and positive antinuclear or smooth muscle antibodies were present in all patients except 1 who had been given immunosuppressants. In 7 patients treated with immunosuppressants and followed up for 9 mo to 10 yr there was modest symptomatic improvement. This improvement was accompanied by a fall in transaminase levels in 6 of the patients and histologic improvement in 3 of 4 patients who had undergone biopsy. Greater use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the last 6 yr led to the identification of 10 of these 13 cases, suggesting a higher incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in childhood than would appear from the literature.\r"

Epidermal growth factor was taken up by the liver remnant at all time points studied (0, 4, 8, 16, and 36 h), but at 8 h after hepatectomy a large quantity was retained by the liver and EGF degradation products appearing in the bile decreased markedly. Electron microscopic autoradiography of the regenerating livers 1 h after injection of 125I-EGF demonstrated that 27% of the grains were associated with hepatocyte nuclei compared to 0.5% in shamoperated controls. There was also a concomitant decrease in grains associated with the lysosomal compartment. Nuclei isolated from regenerating livers exposed to 125I-EGF also demonstrated a three-fold increase in radioactivity compared to nuclei from control livers. Nearly 70% of nuclear radioactivity was precipitable with a specific antibody to EGF, and a small fraction appeared to be part of a high molecular weight complex. These data support the hypothesis that during the pre-S phase of liver regeneration, EGF is translocated to the nucleus rather than to lysosomes, and may participate in the initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis or alteration of gene expression.\r"

This study was conducted to evaluate the lytic activity of lymphokine activated killer cells against fresh autologous and allogeneic, as well as cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Lymphokine activated killer cell was generated by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with various concentrations of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2, Cetus, USA) for various periods of time. A four hour 51Cr release assay was used to measure cytotoxicity. The results show that fresh and cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells were only slightly susceptible to natural killer cells. Normal hepatocytes were resistant to lymphokine activated killer-mediated lysis. Lymphokine activated killer cells could be generated from mononuclear cells of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and normal subjects with lytic activity against fresh autologous and allogeneic and cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but lymphokine activated killer cells from the former was less efficient than that from the latter. It is concluded that the adoptive immunotherapy with combined rIL-2 and lymphokine activated killer may be worth trying in early cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediates components of the acute-phase response, stimulates granulocyte metabolism and secretion, and augments endothelial adhesiveness. We studied the effects of murine IL-1 infusion on circulating granulocytes, their sequestration within the pulmonary microvasculature, lung water, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration in rabbits at 3 and 24 h after infusion. IL-1 administration induced significant (P less than 0.01) granulocytopenia compared with saline-injected controls and at 3 h induced significant increases in both mean alveolar septal wall granulocytes per high power field (HPF) (P less than 0.001) and mean myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity per gram lung tissue (P less than 0.001). At 24 h, IL-1 induced a marked granulocytosis and again significantly increased both mean alveolar septal wall granulocytes per HPF (P less than 0.001) and lung MPO (P less than 0.01). Increased lung water or BALF protein concentration could not be demonstrated in animals killed at either 3 or 24 h after IL-1 administration. Therefore, IL-1 can induce an early profound granulocytopenia followed by later granulocytosis, as well as sustained pulmonary leukostasis in the absence of detectable pulmonary edema formation or an alveolar-capillary leak.\r"

Reduction in late morbidity due to saphenous nerve damage (1.6%), prolonged oedema (0.7%), and delayed sinus formation were also noticeable features.

Patient ages ranged from 34 to 81 years with a mean of 63. Fifty-two per cent were over 65 years old. There were 57 men and 23 women. Of the 80 cardiac operations 85% were coronary artery bypass procedures, with 15% valve operations or other. There was one hospital death. The mean length of postoperative hospitalization was 5 days, and 73% of the patients left the hospital by the 5th postoperative day. Follow-up for 60 days revealed no readmissions nor complications in patients dismissed in 5 days or less. There was one late death presumably from a ventricular arrhythmia in a patient dismissed on the 7th postoperative day. Three point eight per cent (3/79) of the discharged patients were readmitted for varying reasons. The majority of adult cardiac surgery patients can be dismissed safely by the 5th postoperative day.

In contrast to normal women, the 24-h transverse mean plasma ACTH levels were more than 3-fold greater (P less than 0.01), and the 24-h transverse mean serum cortisol levels were more than 2-fold higher (P less than 0.001) in the CD patients. Using a pulse detection algorithm, we found that the elevated ACTH levels in CD were accounted for, in part, by the more than 2-fold greater elevation in mean pulsatile ACTH amplitude (P less than 0.01), while the mean frequency of episodic ACTH and cortisol secretion was similar to that in normal subjects (10-12 episodes/24 h). Although a relatively close temporal relationship between ACTH and cortisol secretory episodes was found (r = 0.70 and 0.72, normal and CD groups, respectively), the increased ACTH pulse amplitude was not consistently associated with comparable cortisol pulses in CD patients. Circadian rhythms were identified for ACTH in two CD patients and for cortisol in all CD patients. The timing of the acrophases and nadirs for cortisol was not significantly altered compared to that in the normal group. After the noon meal, the normal postprandial elevation in cortisol was depressed or absent in the CD group. ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH in four CD patients were highly variable, but were not significantly different from those in normal subjects. These studies demonstrate that the elevated plasma ACTH levels in CD are sustained in part by increased ACTH pulse amplitude without significant alterations in pulse frequency. Despite the persistently high ACTH levels, the circadian variation of cortisol is maintained. The finding of an abnormal postprandial cortisol response in CD may provide an additional biological marker for CD.\r"

Normal or near-normal responsiveness to insulin was also demonstrated. The persistence of GH resistance in the cultured T-cell lines confirms the primary genetic nature of the defect in Laron dwarfism. The preservation of in vitro growth responsiveness to IGF-I in hematopoietic tissue from the Laron dwarfs suggests that affected individuals are sensitive to this factor and may respond to it in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "A \"two-site\" immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) which allows the direct estimation of human CRH (hCRH) in plasma is described. Using this IRMA, basal levels of CRH in normal subjects ranged from 2-28 pg/mL [mean, 15 +/- 7 (+/- SD) pg/mL; n = 58]. Values in men and women were similar. Plasma CRH values within this range were also found in patients with Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and Nelson's syndrome, with no correlation between plasma CRH and ACTH levels in these patients. Elevated plasma CRH levels were found in pregnant women near term [1462 +/- 752 (+/- SD) pg/mL; n = 55], and the dilution curve of this CRH-like immunoreactivity paralleled the IRMA standard curve. After its immunoadsorption from maternal plasma, this CRH-like material eluted on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with a retention time identical to that of synthetic CRH and had equipotent bioactivity with the synthetic peptide in the perfused anterior pituitary cell bioassay. Circulating CRH was not detected in Wistar rats, even after adrenalectomy and subsequent ether stress. Synthetic hCRH was degraded by fresh human plasma relatively slowly; 65% of added CRH remained after 1 h of incubation at 37 C. Degradation was inhibited by heat treatment (54 C; 1 h), cold treatment (4 C; 4 h), or freezing and thawing. Loss of synthetic rat CRH occurred more rapidly when fresh rat plasma was used; only 20% of added CRH remained under the same conditions. The inability to measure CRH in peripheral rat plasma may be due to the presence of active CRH-degrading enzymes which fragment the CRH molecule into forms not recognized by the CRH IRMA.\r"

Women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 49) had plasma CRH levels significantly elevated above this normal range. Similarly, women who subsequently went into premature labor had raised levels several weeks before the onset of labor. After delivery, plasma CRH returned to normal within 15 h. Total plasma cortisol levels varied little throughout the third trimester, but increased during labor and remained elevated 2-3 days postpartum. There was, therefore, no correlation between plasma cortisol and CRH, implying that this placental CRH is not primarily involved in the control of the maternal hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis during pregnancy. The concentrations of CRH in umbilical cord plasma samples were considerably lower than those in the maternal circulation and were close to those in normal nonpregnant adults.\r"

The changes in serum osteocalcin preceded those in bone alkaline phosphatase activity by 1-2 months, in these oophorectomized patients and during estrogen treatment. The changes in these two markers of bone formation over time were significantly different from those in urinary hydroxyproline excretion. A significant positive correlation was found between bone alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin levels in patients after oophorectomy and in 18 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Significant positive correlations also were found between the biochemical indices of osteoblastic function and urinary hydroxyproline excretion and/or nephrogenous cAMP in primary hyperparathyroidism. In most of the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, however, the elevation in bone alkaline phosphatase was more marked than that in osteocalcin. These data indicate that the clinical utility of serum osteocalcin as a marker of bone formation is similar but not identical to that of bone alkaline phosphatase.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) receiving calcium and calciferol supplements (100,000 IU monthly by im injection) were investigated for their calcium, vitamin D, PTH, and osteocalcin status. The corrected plasma calcium concentrations in PBC patients were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. While the mean serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in these patients were similar to those in normal subjects, the mean serum PTH concentration was significantly greater, and it was supranormal in 11 patients. Three patients had elevated corrected calcium concentrations; 1 of them had a concomitant increase in ionized calcium and a supranormal PTH level, and another had a high normal PTH. Ionized calcium concentrations were normal in the rest. Serum osteocalcin concentrations were significantly lower in the patients compared with those in normal subjects. These results indicate that PTH concentrations are frequently elevated in PBC patients despite adequate vitamin D supplementation and normal or even supranormal plasma calcium concentrations. Nonsuppression of PTH concentrations and autonomy of PTH secretion suggest that vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism in such patients probably occur much earlier in the natural history of this disease than is currently realized. Persistent nonsuppressible hypersecretion of PTH probably contributes to the bone disease of primary biliary cirrhosis. The low osteocalcin concentrations probably reflect diminished osteoblastic activity, which may also contribute to osteopenia in these patients.\r"

In five patients with Addison's disease and three patients with hypopituitarism, bolus iv injection of 0.25 and 0.5 mg ACTH-(1-24) reduced plasma CRH levels (that had become elevated 48 h after discontinuation of corticosteroid replacement) to near-normal levels at 30-60 min in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma immunoreactive beta-endorphin levels were similarly decreased in patients with Addison's disease. ACTH-(1-24) (0.25 and 0.5 mg) injection failed to inhibit plasma CRH levels in five normal subjects. Basal CRH release from the rat hypothalamic median eminence in vitro was inhibited by 0.22 and 2.2 nM ACTH-(1-24) and ACTH-(1-39) in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that in the absence of negative feedback control of ACTH secretion by glucocorticoids, ACTH can regulate its secretion by inhibition of hypothalamic CRH release.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a computerized semiautomatic method allowing accurate measurement of bone remodeling activity of the cortico-endosteal envelope of iliac crest biopsies. Measurement of bone turnover of the cortico-endosteal and of the trabecular envelopes were performed in 33 untreated women with postmenopausal vertebral osteoporosis and in 8 age-matched normal women. In normal women, bone remodeling was not different in the trabecular and the cortico-endosteal envelopes. In contrast, osteoporotic women had a marked, significant increase of bone formation and resorption at the cortico-endosteal envelope when compared to trabecular bone. Despite this difference, bone turnover activities of both envelopes were related, as indicated by significant correlations for most parameters between both envelopes. Serum bone gla-protein, previously reported to reflect trabecular bone formation, was also highly correlated with static and dynamic assessment of bone formation of the cortico-endosteal envelope of osteoporotic women but did not reflect bone resorption. When trabecular and endosteal measurements were pooled, correlations between serum bone gla-protein and bone formation were similar or even improved. In conclusion, our data suggest that patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis have active bone turnover at the cortico-endosteal envelope which may contribute significantly to bone loss in this disease. Because the different bone envelopes react differently to various therapeutic regimens, bone turnover of the cortico-endosteal envelope should be considered when assessing the effect of new treatments.\r"

Rats treated with a sub-optimal dose (low dose) of cyclosporine (2 mg/kg per d), bromocriptine (1.8 mg/kg per d), or both drugs were compared with untreated rats in regard to the development of EAU, lymphocyte proliferative responses, and anti-S-antigen serum antibodies. Bromocriptine alone decreased the incidence of EAU only in female rats (P less than 0.01), did not effect the lymphocyte proliferative response, but did significantly decrease antibody titers in both males (P less than 0.004) and females (P less than 0.0005). Low dose cyclosporine also partially decreased the incidence of EAU in female rats, but did not decrease antibody titers or lymphocyte proliferative responses. Bromocriptine plus low-dose cyclosporine led to more marked decreases in the incidence of EAU and anti-S-antigen antibody titers as well as in the lymphocyte proliferative assay (P less than 0.01 for males, P less than 0.0005 for females). This study suggests that bromocriptine can enhance the immunosuppression of low dose cyclosporine.\r"

There was a selective and differential suppressive effect of CY therapy on the various stages of the B cell cycle including activation, proliferation, and differentiation. The proliferative responses to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC) and mitogenic concentrations of anti-mu were suppressed. In contrast, B cells that have been presumably activated in vivo proliferated with a normal pattern when exposed to B cell growth factor in vitro. Chronic low-dose CY therapy also suppressed B cell differentiation. Secretion of immunoglobulin by B cells following in vitro triggering with SAC and a T cell supernatant was suppressed in CY-treated patients. Moreover, differentiation of the large in vivo-activated B cells (which do not require an in vitro activation signal) in the presence of appropriate T lymphocyte supernatant was also suppressed. This selective suppression of B cell function at multiple points in the B cell cycle may be responsible for the efficacy of CY therapy in certain antibody and immune complex-mediated diseases.\r"

A probe of the first intervening sequence (IVS 1) showed the BamHI 3.7-kb fragment in 6 of 17 HLA-DR3/4 controls but in 0 of 13 DR-identical IDDM patients. All IDDM patients (13 of 13) had BamHI fragments of 12 and 4 kb, detected in 9 of 17 controls (P less than 0.02). The simple restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern of the IVS 1 probe was exploited by comparing 113 IDDM patients with 177 healthy controls to show increased prevalences in IDDM of the 12-kb (P less than 0.0001) and 4-kb (P less than 0.0001) fragments. In IDDM patients younger than 20 yr at onset, 98% were 12- and/or 4-kb positive, compared with 63% of controls (P less than 0.0001), giving a relative risk of 91.8 for individuals with both fragments. The 12-kb fragment was linked to HLA-DR4, and the 4-kb fragment to HLA-DR3. Both serologic markers were split and a non-DR3/non-DR4 IDDM patient was 4-kb positive. HLA-DQ seems therefore closer, than HLA-DR, to an IDDM susceptibility gene.\r"

Immunodeficient athymic and cyclosporin A-treated LEW rats developed only the early phase arthritis, which was again paralleled by synovial Ia expression. Chronic expression of high levels of Ia antigen was not observed. Histocompatible F344 rats, both athymic and euthymic, developed minimal, if any, clinically significant arthritis and did not exhibit the enhanced Ia expression demonstrated in the LEW rats. Our results indicate that enhanced synovial Ia expression parallels clinical disease severity and varies by rat strain, and that the rapid onset enhanced synovial Ia expression is thymus independent, whereas the markedly enhanced chronic phase Ia expression is thymus dependent.\r"

We compared 14 postmenopausal osteoporotic women with 12 age-matched postmenopausal normal women before and during 6 d of 1,25(OH)2D administration (2.0 micrograms/d). Serum BGP levels were similar at baseline and increased during treatment in both groups (P less than 0.001).

However, varices can develop anywhere in the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Oftentimes if an active upper gastrointestinal bleeding site is not evident at the time of endoscopy, bleeding is attributed to any esophageal or gastric varices that are present. This supposition may not always be true as illustrated in the two patients presented here. Likewise, the absence of esophagogastric varices in a patient with portal hypertension does not preclude the presence of varices elsewhere. Endoscopic examination of the second and third portion of the duodenum can sometimes be helpful in accurately locating the bleeding site.\r"

Additional information using more robust methodologies will be needed to delineate the role of aging in the shift in location of colorectal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The role of antigen surface density, and its relationship to the function of the Lyt-2/3 complex, in recognition and triggering of allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors has been studied by using a novel type of Class I protein-bearing artificial membrane. The cell-size membranes, termed pseudocytes (artificial cells), can be handled like cells but have a well-defined and easily quantitated surface composition. Class I antigen on these membranes stimulated generation of secondary in vitro allogeneic CTL responses as effectively as allogeneic spleen cells, provided that lymphokines were added to the cultures. Antigen density on the pseudocyte surfaces could be varied over a wide range and quantitated by papain cleavage and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Recognition and triggering of precursor CTL was found to be dramatically dependent on the surface density of antigen and displayed a marked threshold density requirement, below which little or no response occurred. Examination of the effects of anti-Lyt-2 antibody on responses to pseudocytes provided direct evidence for a reciprocal relationship between antigen density and susceptibility to antibody blockade. The results strongly suggest that antigen density is likely to have important biological consequences in control of immune responses. They also show that if Lyt-2/3 functions by interaction with a ligand, then that ligand is the Class I protein.\r"

Virus-specific, class I-restricted CTL activity mediated by total spleen leukocytes isolated from bg/+ or +/+ mice on days 7 or 9 postinfection with LCMV was moderately higher than that mediated by spleen cells isolated from bg/bg mice. The CTL generated in bg/bg mice had aberrant morphology. Lyt-2+ cells isolated from bg/+ or +/+ mice had typical large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology and contained numerous small azurophilic granules, whereas Lyt-2+ cells isolated from bg/bg mice contained only one or two large atypical granules in their cytoplasm. Aberrant LGL morphology correlated with reduced lytic capacity. The bg/bg CTL were inefficient killer cells mediating, on a per cell basis, only one fourth of the lysis mediated by bg/+ CTL. The bg/bg mice appeared to mount a compensatory response to regulate virus replication, because frequencies of Lyt-2+ cells and cells that specifically bound to virus-infected target cells were elevated as compared with their frequencies in bg/+ mice. The higher proportion of the CTL phenotype cells appeared to be a consequence of expanded proliferation of Lyt-2+ cells. These results demonstrate that, in comparison with bg/+ and +/+ mice, bg/bg mice have CTL with reduced lytic capacities, but may compensate during virus infection by expanding the number of these cells. Furthermore, these data suggest that the depressed lytic activity may be a consequence of aberrant granule formation.\r"

  ".U": "87167547\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has shown that the expression of a predominant family of idiotypic determinants (NPb) in the in vitro response to the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl (NP) hapten is dependent on helper activity provided by Ly-1- and Ig-bearing B cells called BH. The ability of these BH cells to perform this idiotype-specific, genetically controlled helper function is related to the NPb idiotype specificity of their cell surface receptors. However, the means by which BH cells communicate with and stimulate NPb idiotypic B cell subsets is unknown. In this paper, an Ly-1- and immunoglobulin-bearing B helper cell hybridoma is described. Supernatants from the hybridoma or its subclones were shown to specifically help the response of NPb idiotypic PFC to NP-Ficoll when added to responder cell cultures depleted of Thy-1 and Ly-1 regulatory cell populations. Under these experimental conditions hybridoma supernatants functioned in much the same fashion as populations of Ly-1- and Ig-bearing BH helper populations described previously. NPb idiotype-specific helper activity was mediated by two separable activities elaborated by the hybridoma, an anti-NPb idiotype antibody and a non-Ig (lymphokine) activity. It was shown that both the Ig and the lymphokine components were required for helper activity. Kinetics experiments showed that the anti-idiotype antibody must be added early in the response to NP-Ficoll, whereas the lymphokine fraction could be added at least as late as day 3 of a 4-day culture in order to observe NPb idiotype-specific help. The data suggest that Ly-1 B cell hybridomas may affect the responsiveness of B cell subsets initially by interaction of anti-idiotype antibody with NPb idiotypic B cell surface receptors, followed by growth or maturation signals mediated by non-Ig lymphokine(s). The possibility that the helper activity of these Ly-1 B cell hybridomas represents the combined effects of an idiotype-specific network system and nonspecific growth or maturation factor activity in direct B cell-B cell interactions is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "As with agents capable of causing the release of IL 1, IL 1 itself is capable of modulating certain tolerance-inducing events. Under the condition used in the present study, it previously has been firmly established that injection of A/J mice with DHGG induces a state of antigen-specific tolerance in both T helper (Th) and B cells. The tolerance in the B cell is of long duration, whereas that in the B cell is of shorter duration. Recombinant IL 1 (rIL 1) given shortly after the tolerogen DHGG results in the inhibition of the induction of tolerance resulting in antibody production. The induction of tolerance is inhibited at both its antigen-specific Th cell and B cell levels, although the latter may be caused by the former. The inhibition of the induction of tolerance by rIL 1 is not correlated to the generation of antigen-specific T suppressor cells. IL 1 mimics lipopolysaccharide and 8-bromoguanosine, which generate IL 1 production, in its ability to interfere with the in vivo induction of tolerance. However, in contrast to these latter mitogens which cause both terminal differentiation of B cells and IL 1 production, IL 1 itself does not cause in vivo circumvention of long-term tolerant Th cells in the presence of competent B cells and antigen. These latter findings suggest that a signal(s) in addition to those delivered by IL 1 is required for activation of the B cell compartment recovering from tolerance to antibody production. AHGG (immunogen) is a potent generator of IL 1 release, whereas DHGG has no effect on IL 1 release from macrophages and AHGG inhibits the induction of tolerance by DHGG. These latter results suggest that the lack of an IL 1 signal may be responsible for the deliverance of a tolerogenic rather than an immunogenic signal to the Th cell.\r"

  ".U": "87167555\r", 
  ".W": "The disturbed homeostasis of the immune system in Obese strain (OS) chickens with spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis consists in a general T cell hyperreactivity (concanavalin A hyperresponsiveness, interleukin 2 (IL 2) hypersecretion), particularly expressed by those lymphocytes which infiltrate the diseased thyroid gland. This abnormality has been attributed to a defective regulation of both IL 2 production and IL 2 function by low m.w. factors, which are present in serum and splenocyte culture supernatants of normal chickens, but deficient in the OS. In the present study we identified the cellular origin of IL 2 antagonistic activity as a nonlymphoid, adherent cell. Suppressor factor production in vitro was confined to the plastic adherent fraction of spleen cells and preincubation of splenocytes with nylon wool, silica particles, or carbonyl iron significantly reduced the nonspecific suppressive activity of the culture supernatant. Kinetic studies revealed the defect in nonspecific suppression to entail prolonged IL 2 production by concanavalin A-activated OS spleen cells. In vivo treatment of normal White Leghorn chickens with silica led to a decrease in suppressive serum activity down to the OS level, whereas neither neonatal thymectomy nor bursectomy had any effect. The defective suppressor factor production in autoimmune chickens appeared to be due to a functional, but not numeric defect of macrophages as revealed by phenol red staining. The possibility that this aberration in adherent cell function might be a secondary phenomenon to the recently described reduced corticosterone tonus in OS chickens was excluded by in vivo substitution with exogenous glucocorticoids which did not normalize the suppressor defect in serum or in conditioned medium. Finally, we present evidence that T lymphoblasts from OS animals are less susceptible to IL 2 antagonistic regulation than normal cells, which possibly further contributes to the T cell hyperfunction of this autoimmune strain.\r"

  ".W": "T cell activation is widely believed to depend on interleukin 1 (IL 1) provided by antigen (Ag)-presenting cells (APC). Because IL 1 is not a constitutive product of APC, we examined the features of its production during the interaction of murine T cell clones and APC. We observed that IL 1 was detectable in supernatants of most myoglobin-specific T cell clones grown with APC and Ag. Two of these T cell clones induced exceptionally high levels of IL 1 in their supernatants, and these same clones demonstrated the unusual restriction to I-Ek, which is a low responder type for sperm whale myoglobin. One of these clones was characterized additionally as to the mechanism of IL 1 induction. This clone rapidly stimulated IL 1 production in the APC population (detectable at 4 hr of co-culture) or in macrophages (M phi) or a M phi-like cell line. IL 1 induction was Ag dependent and H-2 restricted. Induction was radioresistant, both on the part of the T cell and of the IL 1 producer. The IL 1-induction process was attributable to a lymphokine produced by the T cell clone. This lymphokine was distinct from IFN-gamma, TNF and CSF-1 and may account for a principal mechanism of T----APC signalling. The induced IL 1 was the same in size, co-mitogenicity, and pyrogenicity as lipopolysaccharide-induced IL 1.\r"

Demonstration of IL 1 activity was based on the ability of TNF-treated FS-4 cells, subsequently fixed with formaldehyde, to stimulate thymocyte proliferation in the presence of phytohemagglutinin. Incubation of FS-4 cells with the optimal dose of TNF (10 ng/ml) resulted in a marked increase in [3H] thymidine uptake by thymocytes co-cultured with formaldehyde-fixed FS-4 cells. Induction of this apparently membrane-associated IL 1 (MA-IL 1) activity was demonstrable at 6 hr and reached a plateau after 48 hr of incubation with TNF. FS-4 cells did not secrete soluble IL 1 in response to TNF. Dexamethasone suppressed the synthesis of TNF-induced MA-IL 1. A monoclonal antibody specific for TNF neutralized MA-IL 1 induction, indicating that the induction is due to TNF, and not to a contaminant in the TNF preparation. The ability of TNF to induce IL 1 synthesis in FS-4 fibroblasts at the transcriptional level was confirmed by S1 nuclease protection assay. Cytoplasmic RNA from uninduced FS-4 cells contained no demonstrable RNA hybridizing with a human IL 1-alpha cDNA probe and low levels of RNA hybridizing with an IL 1-beta cDNA. Induction with TNF resulted in the appearance of IL 1-alpha mRNA and a very significant increase in IL 1-beta mRNA, indicating that TNF induces the synthesis of both IL 1-alpha and IL 1-beta in FS-4 cells.\r"

The CSF activities produced in response to rIL 1 alpha or rTNF alpha gave rise to a mixture of granulocyte-macrophage colonies and were induced in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, peaking within 3 hr of cytokine injection (preceding peak CSF induction by endotoxin by several hours). Combined injection of suboptimal concentrations of rIL 1 alpha and rTNF alpha were additive, and simultaneous injection of optimal concentrations of each failed to increase CSF levels over that observed with either cytokine alone. Unlike endotoxin, neither cytokine induced interferon in vivo. These findings extend our understanding of the cytokine cascade that is operative in an inflammatory response and may account for many of the observed hematopoietic alterations that accompany inflammation.\r"

Lyt-1+ and Lyt-2- BALB/c T cells derived from appropriately primed spleen cells when co-cultured with 2C3E1 tumor cells in vitro are responsible for the generation or selection of the idiotype-negative tumor variants. The idiotype-specific effector T cells responsible for the variant production in vitro and in vivo are triggered either by viable or irradiated 2C3E1 tumor cells, but not by soluble idiotype-positive monoclonal antibody secreted by the tumor. The idiotype-positive antibody did stimulate the production of the effector T cells when the soluble protein was covalently linked to the plasma membrane of BALB/c spleen cells, but not when the idiotype-positive protein was presented on allogeneic C57BL/6 spleen cells. A single exposure of spleen cells to 2C3E1 cells in vivo was sufficient to prime the idiotype-specific T cells, but the frequency and reproducibility of variant selection increased when the in vivo primed effector T cells were restimulated by irradiated 2C3E1 cells in vitro prior to co-cultivation with the wild-type 2C3E1 cells. The initial variant B cell lines could be segregated into several different phenotypes. However, after extensive cultivation either in vitro or after repeated transfer in vivo, all of the variant cell lines acquired a single stable phenotype that was characterized by the loss of both the surface and secreted idiotype marker and antigen-binding activity associated with the wild-type 2C3E1 cells.\r"

It was also demonstrated that the serum of two individuals contained both IgG and IgM activity directed at autologous affinity-purified IgA.

Binding of IL 1 to the solubilized receptor was detected by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation procedure. Concentrations of CHAPS from 4 to 8 mM were effective in solubilizing the IL 1 receptor. At 10 mM CHAPS, there was some loss in binding activity, whereas 2 mM CHAPS was completely ineffective in solubilizing the receptor. Detergent concentrations of 4 mM were routinely used. The solubilized receptor retains the ability to bind 125I-IL 1 in a specific and saturable manner. Scatchard analysis reveals a single type of high affinity binding site having an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 1.2 X 10(-10) M. Nearly identical KD values are observed for membrane fractions. There are approximately 400 to 500 fmol receptor/mg protein in the detergent extract, corresponding to a two- to threefold enrichment in the Bmax observed for membranes. There is no loss in receptor activity as determined by complete recovery of the total number of binding sites from membranes after solubilization. Binding kinetics show that apparent steady state for the solubilized receptor is reached after 60 min at 37 degrees C. The binding of 125I-IL 1 is essentially irreversible because relatively little bound ligand can be dissociated from the receptor on the addition of excess unlabeled IL 1 at 37 degrees C. Both human IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta compete for binding of 125I-IL 1 to the soluble receptor, confirming that IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta bind to the same receptor. Other recombinant proteins, including interferon-alpha A, interferon-gamma, and interleukin 2 have no inhibitory effect.\r"

However, isoelectric focussing of the purified radioiodinated 40 kD receptor revealed that the monocyte receptor from all of four nonresponder individuals evaluated has a single distinctive pattern of multiple, regularly spaced bands, whereas the pattern of the 40 kD monocyte receptor from 11 responder individuals is of two sorts. One (seen in four of 11 responders) consists of multiple, regularly spaced bands that are asynchronous with the nonresponder pattern, and the other (seen in seven of 11 responders) consists of multiple bands that correspond in mobility to all of the bands of both of the other two patterns. The incidence of these three patterns suggests that the 40 kD Fc receptor is encoded by a single structural gene with two alleles, both of which are expressed.\r"

  ".W": "Among receptors of immunologic importance, antigen receptors on B cells (mIg) and T cells (Ti/T3), as well as receptors for IL 2 and IL 3, appear to utilize a transmembrane signal transduction mechanism that involves protein kinase C (PKC) translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Here we report evidence that B cell surface type II major histocompatibility molecules (I-A and I-E) can act as signal transducing molecules, as evidenced by the ability of soluble ligands that bind these molecules to stimulate rapid translocation (less than 2 min) of cytosolic PKC. This phenomenon differs qualitatively from translocation induced by anti-Ig antibodies and all other ligands thus far studied, in involving an apparent translocation of protein kinase C to the nucleus. Data suggest that I-A/E molecules may play an active role in T cell-dependent B cell activation. They also provide an explanation for the previously observed suppressive effects of soluble I-A and I-E binding ligands on B cell activation in demonstrating that these ligands (anti-IA/E) deplete the cytosolic reservoir of PKC normally translocated to the plasma membrane after anti-Ig or LPS stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "87167593\r", 
  ".W": "When a murine leukemia L1210-specific Lyt-2+ T cell clone, K7L, was injected i.p. into CD2F1 mice together with L1210, the normal growth of L1210 in the peritoneal cavity of the mice at the early stage (days 0 to 5) was strongly inhibited, but L1210 grew progressively at the middle-stage (days 5 to 10), and then was rejected at the late stage (days 10 to 20). The mice thus survived for long times (more than 60 days), whereas the normal control injected with L1210 alone died within 14 days. The L1210 that grew at the middle stage in mice initially inoculated with L1210 together with K7L was a K7L-insensitive (K7L-) variant. All of eight tumor clones established from L1210-K7L- by limiting dilution was insensitive to the antitumor activity of K7L, and this property of tumor clones was stable after repeated in vitro passage. The initial depression of the L1210 growth by K7L followed by growth and rejection of the variant L1210-K7L- by the host T cell activity was then found to prepare a strong, long-lasting (more than 3 mo) immunity to protect mice against the high-dose (10(7) cells per mouse) challenge of original L1210. Corresponding to this result, definite tumor (L1210)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against both variant and original L1210 targets was developed by antigen (L1210) restimulation in the culture of spleen cells from these mice, but was not increased to a detectable level before L1210-K7L- variant started to grow. It was suggested that the 1210-K7L- variant and the original L1210 should have the common tumor-specific antigen that was independent of the K7L-reactive antigen, and that original L1210, whose growth was retarded by K7L, primed the host with the common antigen to be enormously boosted by the subsequently growing L1210-K7L- variant.\r"

However, activated T cells and transformed or activated B cells differed in their ability to present TNP to the TCL; TNP-modified activated lymphocytes stimulated only a subset of the class II-restricted TCL that responded to class II-positive resting cells. Moreover, certain antigen-specific TCL distinguished between antigen presented on activated T cells and transformed B cells. The differences in stimulatory capacity for particular TCL did not appear to reflect differences in the expression of class II molecules or in the ability of these cells to deliver hormonal signals or process antigen. Instead, the data suggest that differences in the ability of the cells to recognize antigen on the surface of different class II-positive cells may be a function of a secondary cell surface interaction.\r"

  ".W": "We have produced a new rat IgG monoclonal antibody against the murine transferrin receptor (TR). This antibody (C2F2) exhibits a surprisingly selective pattern of inhibition of murine lymphocyte activation protocols. C2F2 inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and the generation of cytotoxic T cells. Interestingly, although interleukin 1 (IL 1)-dependent thymocyte co-stimulatory activity is strongly inhibited by C2F2, interleukin 2 (IL 2)-dependent thymocyte co-stimulation is only marginally reduced. IL 2-dependent growth of CTLL cells is also not inhibited by C2F2. These data suggest that IL 1-dependent helper T cell activation is very sensitive to C2F2-mediated inhibition. Studies with phytohemagglutinin, Concanavalin A, and lipopolysaccharide induced activation also indicate that the inhibitory effects of C2F2 are selective, and T cell activation may be more sensitive to inhibition than B cell activation. Although there is little published information about the functional effects of other rat anti-mouse TR antibodies, the available data suggest that the patterns of inhibition produced by anti-TR antibodies may be individually distinct. Anti-TR antibodies may constitute a new set of highly selective probes for the study of lymphocyte activation.\r"

First, a heterogeneous adherent BM (aBM) cell population was established on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. Then, adherent cell and surface IgM+(sIgM+) cell-depleted BM precursors or adherent cell-depleted day 12 fetal liver cells were added. The generation of B cells in these cultures was monitored by staining with fluorochrome-labeled anti-mu-chain antibody and by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of protein A plaque-forming cells at limiting dilution. In the absence of aBM cells, some B cells arose after 24 hr from BM precursors but not from day 12 fetal liver cells. With aBM cells, BM precursors gave rise to a distinct second wave of B cells starting after 5 days of culture. When fetal liver cells were cultured on aBM cells, B cells appeared after a delay of 4 to 5 days. By using Ig allotype-congenic mouse strains (C.AL 20, BALB/c) and an allotype-specific plaque assay, we established that mature B cells originate from the putative progenitors and not from the aBM cell population. In an attempt to eliminate the aBM cell-independent progenitor subset, mice were pretreated with 5-fluorouracil 5 days before BM cells were collected. The remaining cells still contained B cells, but the frequency of c mu+ sIgM- pre-B cells was less than 10(-5). Remaining B cells were removed by anti-mu panning. In cultures of this precursor cell population, LPS-responsive B cells appeared after a delay of about 1 wk, and their generation was totally aBM cell-dependent and was maintained for more than 2 wk.\r"

Adherent and sIgM+ cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) from untreated or 5-fluorouracil-pretreated donors or day 12 fetal liver cells were used as precursor cell populations. When adherent cells from thymus or highly enriched BM-derived macrophages were co-cultured with precursor cells, mature B cells were not developed. Similarly, aBM cell layers generated in the presence of hydrocortisone and horse serum were unable to support aBM cell-dependent precursor differentiation, even though cortisone was removed before the addition of precursor cells. In contrast, this type of microenvironment promoted the differentiation of precursor of myeloid cell lineages. Repeated treatment of established aBM cell populations with a monoclonal anti-macrophage antibody (31.3, known to recognize a surface marker on a subset of BM macrophages) and complement abolished the capacity of otherwise functional aBM cells to sustain the development of B cell precursors. Macrophage-depleted aBM cells regained their function after supplementation with highly enriched BM-derived macrophages grown in vitro. Limiting dilution analysis of aBM cells in microcultures containing saturating numbers of early B cell progenitors also suggests the participation of more than one cell type in the BM cell population. In conclusion, differentiation of early B cell progenitors requires macrophages in addition to at least one additional cell type contained in the aBM cell population.\r"

Whereas the inclusion of IFN-alpha 2 in cultures for 7 days had a relatively minor effect on pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced antibody production, it resulted in a dose-related enhancement of a hapten-specific primary antibody response. Comparison of PWM and IFN-induced [3H]thymidine uptake indicated that the observed IFN activation was not polyclonal. Pretreatment of T cells with IFN for 1 hr before recombination with untreated autologous B lymphocytes increased the anti-TNP response four-fold, whereas similar pretreatment of B lymphocytes had no effect. Furthermore, 2000 R x-irradiation of T cells before coculture with autologous B lymphocytes and IFN abrogated the TNP-specific response. These results indicate that IFN modulates TNP-specific antibody production via a radiosensitive T-helper function. Further subfractionation by panning suggests that the enhancement is mediated by the Leu-3a+ helper/inducer T cell subset. Evidence that a 1-hr exposure to IFN was sufficient to modulate antibody production prompted the examination of T cells for possible receptor mechanisms. Scatchard analysis of 125I-IFN-alpha 2 binding revealed approximately 65 high affinity IFN receptors per cell with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.4 X 10(-10) M. This paper is the first demonstration of the role of T cells in mediating the effects of recombinant IFN-alpha 2 on human primary antibody responses in vitro. These data further suggest that the observed modulation of hapten-specific antibody production in vitro by IFN may involve the binding of IFN to specific cellular receptors expressed by T lymphocytes.\r"

In contrast, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease in which involvement of the skin, kidneys, joints, brain, and other organs may be found. The clinical manifestations vary according to the organ/system involved. It is clinical and therapeutic importance to define which organ/system is involved during the course of the disease. We approached this problem by studying the specificity of autoantibodies that are generated in patients with SLE and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. Among such antibodies are those directed against nuclear components including a variety of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. We have utilized mammalian nuclear preparations enriched with RNP particles as the antigenic source for immunoblotting studies to identify specific antigenic polypeptides. In the study reported here, sera from five groups of patients were examined: 10 patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis; six patients with SLE and myositis; 12 lupus patients with cerebral and/or renal disease; eight patients with SLE but no myositis, renal, or cerebral disease; and 5) 11 patients with muscle weakness or muscle disease not due to myositis. In the first two groups of patients with myositis, antibodies against a nuclear RNP protein of 56 KD was identified in 12 of 16 sera. In contrast, such antibodies were found in the serum of only two of 20 patients with SLE but without muscle involvement (groups 3 and 4), and were not found at all in patients with other muscle diseases. This study has identified a new marker, antibodies against a nuclear RNP protein of 56 KD for detecting muscle involvement among the autoimmune rheumatic diseases.\r"

Examination of the action of C5b-9 on MC phospholipid metabolism indicated that complement induced the activation of phospholipases, leading to quantitative changes in the fatty acid profile of MC membrane phospholipids. These findings demonstrate that cultured MC are highly responsive to nonlytic concentrations of the C5b-9 complex, and suggest that the mesangial deposition of the MAC in many forms of glomerular disease, with resultant cellular activation, may play a major role in the hemodynamic and cellular proliferative events characteristic of these disorders.\r"

Con A and LPS mitogenic responses of splenic lymphocytes as well as total serum Ig levels were equivalent in wst/wst and undiseased control littermates (wst/+ and +/+). Amounts of serum IgM, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA, however, were reduced in wst/wst animals. FACS analyses of Ig+ and isotype-specific B cell populations revealed similar percentages of Ig+, mu +, gamma +, and alpha + cells in wst/wst and control mice. However, the percentage of \"very bright\" Ig+ cells as well as \"very bright\" heavy and light chain-specific B cell subpopulations was increased at least 10-fold in wst/wst B cells as compared with littermate controls. In addition, studies of Ig-specific mRNA accumulation in these animals revealed significant decreases in all isotypes except gamma 3 in spleens of wst/wst mice as compared with littermate controls. Neuropathologic studies in wst/wst mice showed prominent vacuolar degeneration of neurons within anterior horns of the spinal cord and the motor nuclei of the brain stem. No abnormalities were noted in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum nor within myelin sheaths. The abnormalities in the nervous system resembled human motor neuron disease rather than ataxia-telangiectasia as had been reported previously. The immunologic studies suggest that splenic B cells from wst/wst mice have a defect in the ability to \"switch\" from membrane to secreted Ig. In addition, this mutation provides a mechanism to study regulatory interactions between the immune and nervous systems.\r"

A single dose of 1.8 to 3.4 mg 8BE6 caused lymphopenia and greater than 90% depletion of 8BE6+ peripheral T cells 1 to 72 hr later, and a significant but lesser decrease of lymphocytes reacting with another pan-T cell monoclonal antibody (p less than 0.02 at 24 hr). Free serum 8BE6 was detected for up to 48 hr after administration. Immunoperoxidase stains of tissue revealed that lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen were coated with mouse immunoglobulin 1 hr after antibody treatment and displayed in situ capping. Subsequently, there was a loss of T cells in all tissues (spleen, lymph node, liver, and kidney) except the thymus, with normal 8BE6 antigen staining returning by 72 hr. Areas of induration of DH reactions to PPD were reduced in 8BE6-treated GP, compared with pretreatment reactions in the same GP or in control-treated GP (p less than 0.001 for both). The numbers of infiltrating T cells and fibronectin-receptor-positive macrophages were also reduced. In contrast, 8BE6 had no effect on CBH reactions, as judged by erythema and basophil counts in 1-micron sections, although fewer T cells were found in reaction sites. There were no differences in IgM, fibronectin, or Ia staining between 8BE6-treated GP and controls. In vivo administration of a single dose of anti-T cell monoclonal antibody results in a transient, highly specific depletion of T cell populations in peripheral blood and tissues except the thymus. This treatment inhibits DH but not CBH reactions by systemic and local depletion of T cells.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of anti-T cell monoclonal antibody-induced systemic T cell depletion in neuro-autoimmune disease, we studied the in vivo effects of 8BE6, a mouse anti-guinea pig (GP) pan-T cell monoclonal antibody, on the course and immunopathology of the disease model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in adult Strain 13 GP. Central nervous system (CNS) tissues were studied by routine histology and by an immunoperoxidase staining technique using monoclonal antibodies to T cells, IgM, and macrophages. From 3 days before to 10 days after sensitization with GP spinal cord and complete Freund's adjuvant, the GP were given one or two i.p. doses of 3.4 mg 8BE6 or MOPC 21, the parent mouse myeloma ascites, or normal saline. Eighteen of 18 control-treated GP developed typical acute, paralytic EAE 11 to 21 days after sensitization, whereas acute EAE was prevented in 33 of 49 8BE6-treated GP (67%), and the onset was delayed and disease progression was slowed in the others. Five GP treated with 8BE6 from days 11 to 14 after sensitization, at the onset of neurologic signs, rapidly deteriorated within hours after treatment and had loss of T cell staining, and lymphocytolysis in the CNS. 8BE6-treated GP which did not develop acute EAE were observed daily for up to 700 days (mean = 213 days). Twenty-nine of 39 (74%) had from one to six relapses or fixed neurologic deficits. GP in relapse were additionally treated with 8BE6 (22), MOPC-21 (5), or saline (6) in a cross-over protocol. Clinical scores were improved from days 2 to 12 after treatment (p less than 0.05), and complete recovery within 30 days occurred more frequently (p = 0.046) and more rapidly (p less than 0.01), after 8BE6 as compared with control treatments. Recoveries occurred more often if 8BE6 was given early in the relapse. Multiple treatments led to dose-dependent levels of serum antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin detected by an ELISA. There were no differences between acute and chronic EAE in numbers of inflammatory foci or numbers of macrophages and T cells in CNS infiltrates, but GP with chronic EAE had more extensive demyelination and vascular fibrosis and more numerous IgM+ B cells in parenchymal and meningeal infiltrates than in acute EAE (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the mechanism of action of IL 1 on T cell activation. For this purpose, we analyzed the content of specific messenger RNA for lymphokines and other genes that are associated with T cell activation in the murine IL 1-dependent T cell lymphoma LBRM33-1A5. Using cloned genes for IL 2, IL 3, TGF-beta, TY5, IL 2 receptor, Ly-1, c-myc, and p53 as probes in the S1 nuclease protection assay, we compared the amount of specific transcripts among total RNA prepared from unstimulated cells, IL 1 alpha or PHA-stimulated cells, and PHA plus IL 1 alpha-stimulated cells. IL 1 alpha augmented the PHA-induced accumulation of IL 2 mRNA with a magnitude comparable to the amount of IL 2 produced, suggesting that IL 1 alpha modulates IL 2 gene expression at the RNA level. Similar results were obtained with IL 3. We also observed that Ly-1 mRNA appears after PHA treatment and its accumulation was augmented by IL 1 alpha addition. On the basis of the effects of IL 1 alpha and/or PHA treatments on gene expression, we classified these genes into four groups. In all cases, IL 1 alpha seemed to affect mRNA levels quantitatively. These observations support previously described characteristics of this cytokine as a co-stimulator of T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Although the thymus plays a critical role in generation of immunocompetent T lymphocytes, the precise role of the epithelial component of the thymus in the induction of T cell proliferation and maturation remains unknown. Since interleukin 1 (IL 1) is required for mature T cell activation, we have determined whether human thymic epithelial (TE) cells produce IL 1. By using a system for longterm culture of human TE cells, we found that human TE cells produced an IL 1-like factor (TE-IL 1) that augmented the proliferation of C3H/HeJ mouse thymocytes to phytohemagglutinin. IL 1 activity (20 to 200 U/ml) was detected in supernatants of TE cultures from all individuals (2 to 13 yr old) tested. IL 1 activity was also detected in supernatants of TE cultures from a 17-wk fetus but not from a 10-wk fetus. Production of TE-IL 1 was dependent on TE cell density and time in culture with optimal TE-IL 1 activity observed at 10(6) TE cells/ml after 48 to 72 hr of culture. With the use of high performance liquid chromatography, TE-IL 1 chromatographed as a molecule of 18,000 to 20,000 relative molecular mass, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, TE-IL 1 migrated at 15,000 to 17,000 Mr. With the use of isoelectrofocusing gels, charge heterogeneity of TE-IL 1 was demonstrated with two major isoelectric points of 5.7 to 5.8 and 6.9 to 7.0. Polyclonal antibody to human monocyte IL 1 markedly inhibited the TE-IL 1 activity. In indirect immunofluorescence assay of frozen human thymic sections, rabbit anti-IL 1 antibody reacted with epithelial cells in human thymic cortex and medulla. Furthermore, high performance liquid chromatography-purified TE-IL 1 augmented human thymocyte proliferation to suboptimal concentrations of phytohemagglutinin. Thus, thymic epithelial cells are capable of providing an intrathymic source of IL 1-like cytokine (TE-IL 1), which affects thymocyte proliferation. We propose that TE-IL 1 may play an important role in intrathymic proliferation and differentiation of human thymocytes.\r"

In fact, ROHA-9 cells spontaneously secreted an autoregulatory growth factor that co-purified with the constitutively secreted IL 1-like molecules. Accordingly, monocyte-derived human IL 1, free of other known biological activities, also stimulated the growth of ROHA-9 cells in a dose-dependent way. Human recombinant interleukin 2, recombinant IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma and purified IFN-beta were ineffective when used at concentrations up to 1 X 10(3) U/ml. Furthermore, mouse recombinant IL 1, HPLC-purified multi-colony stimulating factor and partially purified preparations of BCGF were ineffective when assayed for growth-promoting activity on ROHA-9 cells. Moreover, a rabbit polyclonal antibody and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human IL 1 molecules blocked the growth of ROHA-9 cells induced by the autologous growth factor and by human IL 1. Lastly, purified human IL 1 increased the clonal efficiency of ROHA-9 cells seeded at a low cell concentration, allowing the isolation of the ROHA-9MC3 subclone, which showed similar growth response specificity and was particularly sensitive to the mitogenic activity of human IL 1.\r"

We now show that not only the biologic activity but also the binding affinity of uromodulin for recombinant IL 1 is dependent upon intact glycosylation. Furthermore, oligosaccharides isolated from pronase-digested uromodulin are immunosuppressive by themselves and are able to compete with native uromodulin for binding to IL 1. We conclude that recombinant IL 1 exhibits lectin-like specificity, and uromodulin is a biologically functional glycoprotein target of the lectin-like specificity of IL 1.\r"

  ".U": "87167622\r", 
  ".W": "Our laboratory recently reported the purification of a unique immunosuppressive glycoprotein isolated from human pregnancy urine (7). This glycoprotein, which we term uromodulin, has a m.w. of 85,000 as assessed on SDS-PAGE and is 30% carbohydrate. Uromodulin blocks in vitro antigen-specific T cell proliferation to recall antigens such as tetanus toxoid at concentrations as low as 100 pM. This glycoprotein also blocks the in vitro generation of spontaneous monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (7, 36). Recent evidence strongly suggests that the primary action of uromodulin is to act as a specific ligand and modulator of IL 1 (10, 33). We now report additional biochemical characterization of uromodulin, and based on three independent lines of evidence, find that its immunologic activity appears to result from its glycosylation. First, measures to alter the tertiary folding of the protein backbone of uromodulin, including succinylation or reduction and carboxymethylation, fail to significantly affect its in vitro bioactivity. Second, after extensive digestion of intact uromodulin with pronase, the majority of the in vitro bioactivity can be recovered in a single carbohydrate-rich fraction. Finally, digestion with N-glycanase (N-glycosidase F-, an enzyme specific for N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharides) and subsequent purification on thin layer chromatography yields a single complex oligosaccharide that appears to be responsible for the majority of the in vitro immunosuppression mediated by uromodulin. These data suggest that uromodulin displays N-linked carbohydrate sequences capable of down-regulating antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro. It has been suggested that endogenous lectins may play an important role as recognition molecules in mammalian, as well as more primitive immune systems (23, 24). Our in vitro biologic data strongly suggest that the carbohydrate portion of uromodulin is an excellent candidate to function as a potential lectin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "BDF1 mice were immunized with a protein antigen, such as ovalbumin (OA) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), absorbed to aluminum hydroxide gel, and their spleen cells were stimulated by homologous antigen for the formation of glycosylation-enhancing factor (GEF). It was found that GEF obtained from OA-primed spleen cells had affinity for OA, whereas those derived from KLH-primed spleen cells had affinity for KLH. Nonspecific GEF, which was obtained by stimulation of normal spleen cells with pertussis toxin, failed to bind OA or KLH. Both antigen-specific GEF and nonspecific GEF are inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but not by N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone. Both factors can be partially purified by binding to p-aminobenzamidine agarose and elution with benzamidine. These findings suggest that not only non-specific GEF but also antigen-specific GEF are serine protease(s). The antigen-specific GEF consisted of two m.w. species, of 65 to 85 kilodaltons (Kd) and 40 to 55 Kd, whereas nonspecific GEF consisted of 50 to 70 Kd and 20 to 30 Kd molecules. The OA-specific GEF augmented the in vitro secondary indirect PFC response of DNP-OA-primed cells to the homologous antigen, but failed to affect the PFC response of DNP-KLH-primed cells to DNP-KLH. Similarly, KLH-specific GEF enhanced the response of DNP-KLH-primed cells but not the response of DNP-OA-primed cells. However, OA-specific GEF failed to replace the requirement for antigen-primed helper T cells. Antigen-specific GEF bound to alloantibodies reactive to the products of the I region of the major histocompatibility complex. The results collectively suggest that antigen-specific GEF is identical to antigen-specific augmenting factors described by other investigators.\r"

The BCL1 and CH12 B lymphoma cells express the B 7.2 antigen constitutively. In small resting B cells from spleen, the B 7.2 expression is induced during polyclonal growth in response to mitogenic stimulation. B 7.2 expression also occurs with a significant frequency in cells from fresh lymphoid tissues. The endogenous expression of the B 7.2 antigen is high in spleen and lymph nodes, and is undetectable in the thymus. The B 7.2 antigen is a microheterogeneous 45,000 to 50,000 dalton glycoprotein with a single polypeptide chain, intramolecular S--S bonds, and N-linked glycan moieties. The folded structure of the B 7.2 antigen appears to contain a domain with hydrophilic properties exposed on the cell surface and a hydrophobic segment that may comprise a transmembrane portion. Considering the observed expression pattern and the molecular structure, we speculate that the B 7.2 antigen has a specific function in regulation of B cell activation, perhaps as a receptor for a regulatory ligand or as a ligand recognized by other B or T cells.\r"

In this report, overlapping peptides based on the sequence of p23 were synthesized to further map the active site in this molecule. The results from these studies indicate that leu-pro-pro-ser-arg (residues 351 to 355) retained the B cell differentiation-inducing properties of p23; however, expression of activity by this sequence was markedly influenced by N-flanking sequences. By using T cell-depleted spleen cell cultures, it was determined that at least two signals are required for p23-induced Ig secretion: one supplied by p23 directly and one supplied by a T cell-replacing factor present in p23-conditioned spleen cell supernatants. Both signals were mapped into the sequence leu-pro-pro-ser-arg. However, the latter signal, but not the former signal, again appeared to be influenced by sequences proximal to the active site. These data indicate that although the leu-pro-pro-ser-arg sequence is able to provide both required signals for p23-induced Ig secretion in spleen cell cultures, there may be subtle differences in how the cell types involved in this response interact with and/or are activated by this sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Although the existence and ubiquity of the C1q receptor is well established, its role in health and disease is largely unknown. Interleukin 1 (IL 1) is the major immunoregulatory molecule produced by macrophages and B lymphoblastoid cell lines. In this paper we present evidence that occupancy of C1q receptors by C1q on B lymphoblastoid cell lines inhibits \"IL 1-like\" activity, which is constitutively produced by these cells. When 5 X 10(6) Raji cells were cultured (24 hr at 37 degrees C) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of C1q (final concentration; 5 to 50 micrograms/ml) and the cellfree supernatants were analyzed for their effect on thymocyte proliferation by using the concanavalin A co-mitogenesis assay for IL 1, a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction of 3H-TdR incorporation was observed. Similar results were obtained when Daudi and Wil2WT cells were used, whereas Molt4, which is a T cell lymphoblastoid cell line, neither produced \"IL 1-like\" activity nor was affected by C1q. When immune complex-bound C1q was used instead of free C1q, inhibition of B cell IL 1 activity was also observed. Mixing experiments showed that Raji cells incubated with C1q released an inhibitor of IL 1-induced thymocyte proliferation. C1q alone had no effect on thymocyte proliferation in the presence or absence of human IL 1. In addition, the effect of C1q on IL 1 activity was abrogated either when the C1q was heat inactivated (56 degrees C, 60 min) or when the C1q was incubated with the cells in the presence of F(ab')2 anti-C1q. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that B cell receptor-bound C1q may play an important role in immunoregulation.\r"

The incorporation of Salmonella minnesota smooth-and rough (Re) lipopolysaccharide or primarily monophosphoryl lipid A into multilamellar and small unilamellar vesicles consisting of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and cholesterol (molar ratio 4:1:4) reduced the interleukin 1 inducing potency of these substances about 1000-fold. When corrected for the actual uptake of radiolabeled free and liposome-incorporated lipopolysaccharide by the cells, this difference amounted to 100- to 1000-fold. In addition, liposome-associated Re-lipopolysaccharide was about 1000-fold less potent in stimulating the Fc-receptor mediated uptake of IgG-coated sheep erythrocytes by the cells. The ability of lipopolysaccharide and lipid A to coagulate the Limulus amoebocyte lysate appeared to be at least 100-fold decreased upon incorporation into phospholipid vesicles. Control experiments demonstrated that liposomes prepared without lipopolysaccharide did not reduce the studied activities of free lipopolysaccharide. In conclusion, the incorporation of lipopolysaccharide into the liposomal membrane probably prevents the interaction of the hydrophobic portion of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide with the plasma-membrane structures involved in the activation of macrophages and with the proteins of the Limulus amoebocyte lysate. This indicates that the direct interaction of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide with the macrophage plasma-membrane is required to optimally trigger the studied responses.\r"

The release of lymphokines, in turn, \"activates\" macrophages, enhancing their bactericidal capacity. Because prior studies suggest that I-A+ accessory cells play a critical role in this pathway, we assessed the effects of an anti-I-A antibody on the murine host resistance to listerial infection. To this end, we infused Listeria into control C57BL/6 mice (I-Ab haplotype) and mice of the same strain which had been pretreated 18 hr earlier with D3137 (a monoclonal IgG2a anti-I-Ab,d antibody). Preliminary studies demonstrated that this antibody can markedly inhibit antigen-induced proliferation of Listeria-dependent T cells in vitro and (at a dose of 1 mg/animal) can markedly reduce I-A expression on splenocytes in vivo. Even though D3137 pretreatment prevented the splenomegaly normally observed after Listeria infusion into mice, it protected animals infused with otherwise lethal concentrations of Listeria. Because antibody-treated animals had sevenfold fewer organisms in their spleens 18 hr after infection and 1000-fold fewer organisms than control animals 3 days after infection, improved survival resulted from an antibody-induced increase in the bactericidal capacity of the MPS. Protection was not noted when C1.18.4 (an IgG2a myeloma protein without known antibody activity) was infused into C57BL/6 mice or when D3137 was infused in B10.BR (I-Ak) mice. D3137 also protected (B10 X B10.BR)F1 mice (which are hybrids bearing I-Ab and I-Ak), suggesting that complete blockade of antigen presentation is not a prerequisite for its protective action. Further studies into the mechanism for these effects may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of MPS activation in response to immunologic challenge.\r"

The calcium response to cytochalasin derived largely from the influx of extracellular calcium, although a small, transient elevation in intracellular calcium persisted when the suspension medium was made calcium-free with EGTA, implicating an intracellular source for a portion of the calcium response. Single cell fluorescence studies revealed that cytochalasin elicited a calcium response in most splenic B cells in suspension, indicating that this phenomenon is not restricted to a subpopulation of responding B cells. Phorbol esters inhibited the B cell calcium response to cytochalasin, and an established response to cytochalasin was rapidly and completely reversed by subsequently administered phorbol ester. T cells that lack the cytochalasin pathway showed a markedly diminished calcium response that was only apparent at higher cytochalasin concentration. However, B cells from xid-defective [CBA/N X DBA/2]F1 males, which fail to respond to anti-immunoglobulin plus cytochalasin, showed a calcium response to cytochalasin similar to that of phenotypically normal F1 females. These data, along with the finding that the rise in intracellular calcium occurred in naive B cells as well as B cells previously treated with anti-immunoglobulin, suggest that there is no clear association between the calcium response induced by cytochalasin and the ability of cytochalasin to stimulate progression to S phase. However, this effect of cytochalasin may suggest a connection between actin filaments and calcium influx in B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cells have been implicated in defense against malignancies, especially leukemia. Because patients with leukemia and preleukemic disorders manifest low NK activity, it is possible that NK cell impairment may contribute to leukemogenesis. In view of this possibility, it was important to characterize the NK cell defect of leukemic patients and to design new approaches for its correction. Analysis of the mechanism of NK cell defect demonstrated that NK cells of leukemic patients were impaired in their tumor-binding and lytic activity and did not display ability to recycle or to produce cytotoxic factor. However, deficient NK activity could be corrected by culture of peripheral blood effector cells with IL 2. IL 2-activated NK cells manifested restoration of all measured parameters of the cytotoxic mechanism, as exemplified by normalized tumor-binding and lytic activity, as well as the rate of lysis and ability to recycle. Importantly, such in vitro stimulated cytotoxic cells displayed reactivity against fresh leukemic cells of autologous as well as allogeneic origin. Another interesting observation from these studies was that the NK activity was also induced in the leukemic bone marrow, a tissue with a very low frequency of cytotoxic NK cells. It is important to note that cultured NK cells did not represent a stationary cell population, but proliferated in vitro quite actively (doubling time 3 to 6 days) for at least 5 wk. Characterization of the in vitro generated cytotoxic cells indicated that these cells displayed large granular lymphocyte morphology and CD16 and Leu-19 cell surface phenotype. Our data demonstrate that the NK cell defect of leukemic patients is not a permanent phenomenon, but can be reversed in culture with IL 2, and that fully cytotoxic NK cells can be maintained and expanded in vitro. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that adoptive transfer of autologous NK cells to the patients may represent a promising new therapy for treatment of leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes are capable of releasing distinct immunomodulating cytokines such as epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) and an epidermal cell-derived natural killer cell augmenting factor (ENKAF). The present study was performed to determine whether human keratinocytes also may secrete an interleukin 3 (IL-3)-like mediator and thereby participate in the regulation of mast cell activity in the skin. Supernatants of freshly isolated human epidermal cells (EC) and malignant keratinocyte cell lines (A 431, SCC) were tested for their capacity to induce the proliferation of IL-3-dependent cell lines 32 DCL and FDCP. Human epidermal cell interleukin 3 (EC IL-3) is spontaneously released by freshly isolated EC, A 431, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. However, both normal EC and A 431 cells produced increased levels of EC IL-3 activity when cultured in the presence of different stimulants, such as phorbol myristate acetate and lipopolysaccharide. The EC IL-3 activity was not inhibited when treated with a monoclonal anti-IL-1 or anti-IL-2-antibody. Biochemical characterization showed that human EC IL-3 has a molecular weight of 17K, elutes of DEAE-ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as one major peak at 0.36 M NaCl, and upon HPLC-chromatofocusing exhibits 3 isoelectric points of 7.8, 7.5, and 5.6. Upon reversed-phase HPLC, EC IL-3 activity eluted at about 100% acetonitrile. When highly purified EC IL-3 was labeled with 125I and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single homogeneous band exhibiting a molecular weight of 17K was seen, which correlated with the IL-3 activity and was free of ETAF/IL-1, IL-2, and interferon activity. These data indicate that human EC synthesize an IL-3-like cytokine which is distinct from ETAF/IL-1, IL-2, and interferon and thereby may participate in the regulation of mast cell activity during inflammatory and fibrotic, as well as hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

The follicles were examined by transmission electron microscopy prior to infusion and at intervals during catagen regression in order to determine the mechanism(s) involved in follicle involution. Cell deletion by apoptosis occurred in all cell types in the proximal region of catagen follicles between 12 h and 6 days after the beginning of infusion. Apoptosis also occurred in the basal layer of involuting sebaceous glands at 2 and 3 days, following earlier mEGF-induced proliferation. This process involved nuclear chromatin condensation and margination in single, scattered cells which subsequently fragmented and were ultimately phagocytosed and degraded by adjacent unaffected cells. It was concluded that during mEGF-induced catagen, wool follicle involution was accomplished largely through cell death and deletion by apoptosis.\r"

LPS-stimulated and unstimulated monocytes infected with the isolate showed expression of immediate-early CMV antigens and were significantly more suppressive for lymphocyte proliferation than were strain AD169-infected monocytes, which rarely expressed detectable viral protein. Human CMV infection of LPS-stimulated and unstimulated monocytes resulted in abrogation of interleukin-1 activity, with the effect being marked in LPS-stimulated monocytes infected with the clinical isolate of CMV. Addition of interleukin-1 to infected, stimulated monocytes completely restored lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, whereas addition of this leukokine to infected, unstimulated cells could not restore this response.\r"

Immunizing guinea pigs with subunit HSV glycoprotein vaccines favorably altered the clinical and virological course of initial infection and substantially reduced the incidence, frequency, and duration of recurrent herpetic infections.

In all animals tested, low levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected only after two or more immunizations. Lymphocyte transformation tests in owl monkeys suggested low or borderline levels of cellular immunity. The survival of immunized mice after intracerebral challenge was inversely related to the challenge dose. Immunized guinea pigs challenged by intravaginal inoculation showed reduced morbidity at the site of inoculation and were protected from CNS disease. Both immunized and nonimmunized monkeys were highly susceptible and could not be differentiated with respect to morbidity or mortality when challenged with 1,000 pfu of HSV-2 by the intravaginal route.\r"

Absorption of oral antibiotics was assessed by determining the trough serum bactericidal titers for the infecting organism; whenever feasible, the dosages were adjusted to achieve trough titers greater than or equal to 1:8. The follow-up period ranged from six to 66 months (mean, 42.4 months). Eighteen of 21 patients had no clinical signs of recurrence after initial therapy.
