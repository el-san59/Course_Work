We and others have recently demonstrated direct binding of SE to human MHC class II molecules. In this study, we have compared in detail the ability of class II molecules to bind two SE, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and SEB. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data indicate that SEB binds to Ia+ human cell lines with a 10-fold lower affinity than TSST-1. Likewise, SEB precipitates HLA-DR alpha- and beta-chains from detergent lysates of Ia+ cells less efficiently than TSST-1. The binding of TSST-1 and SEB to transfected L cells expressing HLA-DR and HLA-DQ gene products was differentially inhibited by anti-HLA-DR mAb. There was virtually no cross-inhibition of TSST-1 and SEB in competitive binding assays. We conclude that TSST-1 and SEB bind to two MHC class II sites which can be distinguished by their relative accessibility to blocking by anti-class II mAb and heterologous toxin.\r"

The present study investigated the involvement of this mechanism in the bactericidal defect of PMN induced by thermal injury in a guinea pig model. Peripheral and peritoneal exudate PMN harvested from thermally injured guinea pigs at 1 or 2 days postburn had decreased bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a marked increase in cAMP content. Production of PGE1 by these cells in the absence of exogenous PMN activators was also increased. Treatment of PMN in vitro or in vivo with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and piroxicam) restored bactericidal activity to normal and concomitantly reduced cAMP content and PGE1 production. A concomitant reduction in cAMP content and PGE1 production was also observed as bactericidal activity of PMN returned to normal under natural conditions during 4 to 7 days postburn. The enhancement of PMN bactericidal activity mediated by NSAID was fully counteracted by purified PGE1, theophylline, and by cAMP itself. These results suggest that the bactericidal defect of PMN induced by thermal injury is related to elevation of cAMP and that PGE1 plays a significant role in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Ag stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells results in hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, a transient increase in concentration of cytosol Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i), a gradual increase in cytosolic pH (pHi) and the activation of protein kinase C. To determine whether all these changes serve as signals for secretion, studies were conducted with cells permeabilized with streptolysin O in which pHi and [Ca2+]i could be varied independently of each other and enzyme activities could be manipulated. At resting pHi (approximately 7.0) and [Ca2+]i (0.1 microM), the permeabilized cells showed little secretory response to Ag. At resting pHi, elevated levels of Ca2+ (0.33 microM) were required for maximal secretory response to Ag. At a pHi of 7.4, however, 0.1 microM [Ca2+]i was sufficient to sustain near maximal responses to Ag. Therefore, a small increase of [Ca2+]i to 0.33 microM was required to initiate secretion, but once the pHi was elevated secretion could be sustained at near basal levels of [Ca2+]i. Since elevating the [Ca2+]i and pHi, by themselves promoted little secretion, another potentiating signal must have been generated by antigen stimulation. This signal was possibly transduced via hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and protein kinase C. Even with an elevated [Ca2+]i (0.33 microM) the hydrolysis of the phospholipids and secretion stimulated by Ag were inhibited by guanosine 5'(2-O-thio)diphosphate and neomycin. Furthermore, both protein-kinase C and the secretory response to Ag were lost after permeabilized cells were washed but both were retained if cells were exposed to PMA before permeabilization.\r"

  ".U": "90010136\r", 
  ".W": "Macrophages have a marked capacity to invade tissue in the course of cellular immune reactions that is thought to be based on the action of urokinase (u-PA). u-PA is an ubiquitous serine protease that converts the zymogen plasminogen into the active protease plasmin. u-PA binds to specific receptors on the macrophage thereby enabling the cell to degrade interstitial tissue in the microenvironment. Two cytokines produced in the course of cellular immune reactions, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, increase the number of u-PA receptors on human cultured monocytes from 14,000 to 64,000 and 30,000 receptors/cell, respectively. We used an amnion invasion assay to investigate whether activated human monocytes exhibit an enhanced capacity to invade interstitial tissue in correlation to the increased numbers of u-PA receptors. We show in this study that IFN-gamma, which increases the number of endogenously occupied and saturable u-PA receptors, causes a threefold increase of monocyte invasion into amnion tissue in comparison to control cells. The anti-u-PA mAb MPW5UK, which blocks the activity of u-PA, inhibits monocyte invasiveness significantly. In contrast, TNF-alpha, which increases only the number of saturable u-PA receptors on monocytes, does not enhance their invasiveness. This finding suggests that only endogenously occupied u-PA receptors are instrumental in monocyte invasiveness. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that: 1) saturation of monocytes with u-PA does not further increase their invasiveness and that 2) plasminogen-activator inhibitor-2, a specific inhibitor of u-PA associated with endogenously occupied, but not of u-PA bound to saturable receptors, inhibits monocyte invasiveness completely.\r"

Both class I- and class II-restricted T clones specifically proliferated to hepatitis B virus envelope proteins, but not to hepatitis B core Ag. The fine specificity of T cells was studied by using rAg having different composition in relation to HBV-envelope proteins or synthetic peptides of preS regions. The antigenic determinant recognized by T cell clones mapped to the preS2 region based on the response to r(preS1+preS2+S) and to r(preS2+S) and the failure to respond to S or preS1 alone. More precise epitope mapping was based on synthetic preS2 peptides 120-150 or 120-134, which stimulated both class I- and class II-restricted T clones, whereas preS2 153-171 or preS1 1-110 peptides did not; thus, the preS2 120-134 appears to contain both the residues binding to class I molecules and the residues binding to class II molecules. Moreover, strong and specific cytotoxic responses of these clones were observed only when HLA-matched EBV-lines, used as target cells, were previously sensitized with r(preS1+preS2+S) or preS2 peptides, which were shown to stimulate the clones. Thus, a preS2 epitope can represent a target Ag for liver-infiltrating T cells, which could kill the hepatocytes expressing the Ag plus the appropriate MHC molecule.\r"

Synthetic peptides identified six nonoverlapping epitopes on the HA1 subunit, and CD4+ T cell clones, specific for these regions, discriminated between natural variant viruses that had accumulated amino acid substitutions during antigenic drift. Here, we demonstrate similar specificity and diversity for the Iad haplotype and have identified multiple T cell epitopes within the sequences HA1 56-76, 71-91, 81-97, 177-199, 186-205, and 206-227. These also include recognition sites for neutralizing antibodies and correlations can be made between antigenic drift substitutions in H3 subtype viruses and the specificity of individual CD4+ clones for mutant HA. Moreover, these peptides appear not to exhibit structural homology and fail to compete for Ag presentation, indicating heterogeneity in peptide-Ia interaction. To explain the observation that CD4+ T cells, from two major haplotypes, recognize antibody binding regions of the HA molecule, we propose that surface Ig receptors of the Ag-specific B memory cell exert a direct effect on the processing of HA peptides and subsequent selection of the class II-restricted T cell memory repertoire after natural infection.\r"

  ".W": "The 195-kDa major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf PMMSA) is a potential candidate for the development of a blood-stage malarial vaccine. We have focused on an analogous 230-kDa Ag of the rodent malarial parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, in an effort to study this protein in an experimental model system. Previously we reported the cloning and sequencing of a 2.1-kb portion of the gene encoding the carboxyl-terminal 77 kDa of the Py PMMSA. This region contained the B cell epitope recognized by mAb 302, a mAb shown to protect mice passively against P. yoelii challenge infection. To localize this B cell epitope, we have inserted various restriction fragments of the cloned Py PMMSA sequence into the bacterial expression vector pMG27NSTerm. Recombinant peptides of 74, 40, 34, 17, and 10 kDa have been produced which bear the epitope recognized by mAb 302. The results demonstrate that this B cell epitope is located within the most carboxyl-region of the Py PMMSA which contains a series of ten cysteine residues, also found in the PMMSA of P. falciparum. Further analysis showed that the reduction of disulfide bonds as well as the deletion of CYS-607 of the cloned sequence, resulted in the loss of the expression of this epitope. It is of interest that this epitope does not appear to be a dominant B cell determinant of the Py PMMSA molecule during infection. Inasmuch as this cysteine-rich domain of Py PMMSA displays considerable homology with that of Pf PMMSA, our data suggest that this region of the Pf PMMSA should be considered for inclusion in the development of a blood-stage vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "Because previous work has suggested that NK cells may be important in host resistance against the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii we examined whether human NK cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells have activity against trophozoites and cysts of this organism in vitro. A method to radiolabel Toxoplasma trophozoites with 51Cr was developed and direct cytotoxic activity was determined by using modifications of the standard 51Cr release assay. Viability of 51Cr-labeled trophozoites assessed by both methylene blue staining and trypan blue exclusion was greater than 90%. Significantly more 51Cr was released by anti-Toxoplasma antibody and C than by antibody in the absence of C. Incubation of trophozoites with freshly isolated human NK cells or NK cells activated with either rIL-2 or rIFN-alpha did not result in significant release of 51Cr (specific lysis was 0 to 2.3%). In contrast, the average specific lysis of radiolabeled trophozoites by LAK cells was significant (specific lysis was 7.8% +/- 1.1, p less than 0.01). In a series of separate experiments, preincubation of radiolabeled trophozoites with heat-inactivated normal or Toxoplasma antibody-positive human serum increased the cytotoxicity of LAK cells from a mean specific lysis of 15% +/- 4.5 to 39% +/- 8.5, respectively (p less than 0.05), as assessed by 51Cr release. Because previous work has shown that radioisotope release from parasites may be nonspecific, separate experiments were performed to determine the cytotoxicity of LAK cells against antibody-coated trophozoites by using ethidium bromide-acridine orange staining to assess effector cell damage. LAK cells had a mean specific lysis of 51% against antibody-coated trophozoites by ethidium bromide-acridine orange staining. Preincubation with heat-inactivated Toxoplasma-antibody positive human serum did not increase activity of rIL-2-activated NK cells against 51CR-labeled trophozoites. Neither human NK cells (freshly isolated or activated by rIL-2 or rIFN-alpha) nor LAK cells were cytotoxic for purified preparations of cysts of Toxoplasma isolated from the brains of chronically infected mice.\r"

This region near the N-terminus of the S2 subunit is recognized by polyclonal antisera and by the majority of mAb that cross-react with denatured protein. Despite their involvement in neutralization, epitopes in this region were conserved in different serotypes. Epitopes of four mAb and two chicken antisera were localized by using prokaryotic expression of cDNA fragments, and overlapping peptides with lengths increasing from 3 to 12 residues (PEPSCAN). We found overlapping epitopes with lengths of 6, 9, 11, and more than 17 residues. The results indicate that the expression products are antigenically equivalent to denatured protein fragments. This suggests a general strategy for the localization of sequential epitopes in large proteins. We propose that the immunodominance of the N-terminal region of S2 is explained by features of the protein structure. Presumably, this region is a protruding protein segment of about 20 residues with a high local mobility, as indicated by the antigenicity of the peptides. The conservation of the sequence points to an involvement in a molecular recognition process during infection.\r"

Immunization with the free peptides of 11, 17, and 21 residues failed to elicit serum antibodies or T cell responses. However, immunization with the SP17 and SP21 linked to tetanus toxoid (TT) as a carrier elicited serum antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes, not only to the SP but also to the native streptococcal Ag. In vivo recall of SP-TT immunized monkeys with suboptimal doses of the native streptococcal Ag resulted in a significant increase in antibodies, both to the SP and the streptococcal Ag, confirming that the SP shares antigenic epitopes with the native Ag. B and T cell epitopes were then determined and a B cell epitope was found in residues 8-13, whereas an overlapping T cell epitope was located in residues 7-15. The T cell epitope has an amino-terminal leucine and carboxy-terminal glycine and alanine added to residues 8-13 of the B cell epitope. In spite of the B and T cell epitopes being expressed in SP17 (residues 1-15), the monomer failed to induce serum antibodies without a carrier. However, immunization with a dimer of SP17 elicited both serum antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes without a carrier. The results suggest that the monomeric SP17 is not immunogenic and needs to be dimerised in order to elicit antibodies and T cell responses, both to the SP and to the streptococcal Ag.\r"

The cDNA encoding B7 was molecularly cloned by cDNA expression. The identity of the B7 cDNA was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation of a 44/54-kDa protein from B7 transfected COS cells. The sequence of the B7 polypeptide predicts a type I membrane protein of 262 amino acids with eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular region and a short, highly positively charged cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular region is homologous to the Ig gene superfamily and consists of two contiguous Ig-like domains. The first Ig domain has the characteristics of a variable domain and the second that of a constant region domain. B7 mRNA was detected only on anti-Ig activated B lymphocytes and not in other hematopoietic cells. After in vitro activation of B cells with anti-Ig, B7 mRNA was maximally expressed between 4 and 12 h with four RNA transcripts of 1.7, 2.9, 4.2, and 10 kb. The 2.9-kb mRNA predominated in in vitro-activated B cells whereas the 1.7-kb mRNA was most abundant in tumor cells of B cell origin. B7 expression was confined to several histologically defined subgroups of B cell malignancies. The majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were B7+ whereas the B cell leukemias and circulating non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were generally negative. These results demonstrate that the B7 gene encodes a unique molecule belonging to the Ig superfamily and that B7 expression is limited to normal activated B cells and noncirculating B cell malignancies.\r"

Increased HIV production is likely caused by the activation of the retroviral promoter, and the HIV promoter may be regulated by intracellular signals induced during immune stimulation. To examine the regulation of retroviral promoter activity in normal, Ag-specific primary T lymphoblasts, a heterogeneous population of primary human T cells was transfected with either the HIV promoter or a promoter from a different retrovirus, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) by protoplast fusion technique. Transfected T cells responded normally to Ag or mitogen stimulation, and activation of these T cells increased both the HIV and RSV promoter activity. Promoter activity was assessed by using transient expression assays after the T cells were restimulated with Ag, mitogen, or IL-2. In situ hybridization of transfected human T cells showed that 68 to 95% of activated lymphocytes expressed CAT mRNA directed by HIV or RSV. Thus, protoplast transfection of primary T cells was efficient in that the majority of cells expressed CAT message. By deletion of different regions of the HIV promoter, the enhancer region was identified as necessary for effective HIV promoter activity. In addition these deletion studies identified a region that negatively affects HIV promoter activity in primary T cells. Cotransfection of the HIV promoter with the HIV transactivator protein, tat, increases HIV promoter activity in both resting and activated primary human T cells only when the tat target sequences were present.\r"

From a single topical application of tretinoin, isotretinoin was as abundant as tretinoin in the chamber receiver solution, dermis, epidermis, and on the skin surface at 24 h after topical application. The data suggest the possibility that isotretinoin may have an important role in the pharmacology of topically applied tretinoin.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of scleroderma is still elusive, although autoimmune mechanism involvement has been suggested. The present study was designed to investigate whether or not rat scleroderma would appear as one of the symptoms in a recently described model for autoimmune disease. The model is based on manipulation or reconstitution of the immune system after lethal irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation by temporary administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine-A. Withdrawal of cyclosporine-A 6-12 wk after bone marrow transplantation gives rise to autoimmune reactions causing clinical pathology similar to graft-versus-host disease. We discuss the chronic phase of this disease, approximately 30 wk after cyclosporine-A was withheld at that time-about one-third of the rats had developed histologic skin lesions comparable to those seen in patients with scleroderma. Therefore, we propose this model as a new, experimental autoimmune model for scleroderma in humans.\r"

It is speculated that the saliva of the irradiated bugs was activated by gamma rays and was responsible for the induction of skin papillomas.

The free radical reducing activity of a) isolated thioredoxin reductase, a flavin containing oxidoreductase, b) skin homogenates, and c) the epidermis of hairless mice was studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. In all three systems, reduction rates of different classes of nitroxide free radicals exhibited the following order: oxazolidinoxy greater than piperidinoxy greater than dihydropyrroloxy. The main reductant for piperidinoxy radicals in mouse skin homogenate is ascorbic acid. Other reducing activities were stimulated by NAD(P)H and could be inhibited by N-ethyl maleimide, suggesting involvement of thiol-dependent processes. Mammalian thioredoxin, a competitive inhibitor of nitroxide reduction by thioredoxin reductase, significantly stimulates nitroxide scavenging in skin homogenate. Thioredoxin reductase did not significantly participate in nitroxide reduction in skin homogenates. At the surface of mouse epidermis a cationic dihydropyrroloxy nitroxide, which was stable in the presence of mammalian thioredoxin reductase was readily reduced. The epidermal reduction was inhibited by zinc, N-ethyl maleimide, and by heat (70 degrees C, 5 min). At least for mouse epidermis, reduction of a variety of nitroxides is a complex phenomenon involving enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms and cannot be used as a specific assay for an enzyme, e.g., thioredoxin reductase. The study indicates the epidermis contains an effective antioxidant system that scavenges ascorbate-sensitive piperidinoxy nitroxides as well as more reducing radicals exemplified by dihydropyrroloxy nitroxides.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been shown that hapten-modified cultured Langerhans cells are able to activate small resting syngeneic L3T4+ T helper cells from nonsensitized animals. Repeated stimulation of these T cells with hapten-modified cultured Langerhans cells leads to the establishment of L3T4+ hapten-specific interleukin-4-producing T-cell lines. Here we report on further characteristics of primary hapten-dependent activation of L3T4+ T cells and of T-cell lines derived from them. Dendritic cell-enriched spleen cells were as able as Langerhans cells to activate nonsensitized T helper cells after hapten modification. However, M12c, a major histocompatibility complex class II-positive B-cell line that was able to activate small, resting, allogeneic L3T4+ T cells was not able to stimulate syngeneic T helper cells after hapten modification. Thy1+ dendritic epidermal cells did not significantly affect the magnitude of primary T helper cell proliferation induced by cultured Langerhans cells. Restimulation of in vitro primed T helper cells with hapten-modified cultured Langerhans cells revealed the presence, within the primed T helper cell population, of activated cells with specificity to an unrelated hapten, suggesting that, in hapten-dependent T helper cell activation, hapten-nonspecific cells are activated along with those that are hapten specific. Restimulation of a hapten-specific long-term T helper cell subline using different antigen-presenting cell types demonstrates that factors other than major histocompatibility complex class II density or tissue derivation of the antigen-presenting cell play a role in the activation of T cells in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that in vitro generated hapten-specific T helper cell lines may not show strict major histocompatibility complex restriction.\r"

Immunohistochemistry of normal adult human skin using monoclonal antiserum to ICAM-1 demonstrated focal reactivity restricted to endothelium lining the dermal microvasculature. Delayed hypersensitivity responses elicited with dinitrochlorobenzene in the skin of the same subject were evaluated sequentially over a 96 h period using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. The first alteration observed consisted of mast cell degranulation within perivenular foci in the superficial dermis at 4 h after antigen challenge. Sparse superficial perivascular T-cell infiltrates were present by 24 h. Progressive staining for ICAM-1 was observed in microvascular endothelium and in dermal dendritic cells between 24 and 48 h. ICAM-1 expression was documented focally within the lower epidermis at 48 h and diffusely within the lower and upper epidermal layers at 96 h. ICAM-1 expression by keratinocytes was consistently associated with T-cell migration into the epidermis, whereas migration was never observed in the absence of ICAM-1 reactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed ICAM-1 to be exclusively present on endothelial cells, dermal dendritic cells, mononuclear cells, and keratinocytes, and permitted characterization of the patterns of membrane reactivity. ICAM-1 expression by epidermal cells appears to be closely linked to the progressive migration of T cells from the dermis into the epidermis that characterizes cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity.\r"

The 5-methylcytosine in DNA from neonatal and adult human keratinocytes was found to vary as a function of differentiation state. Differentiation of keratinocytes in vitro was promoted using a simple method where keratinocytes were plated directly onto the plastic surface of a culture flask, grown to confluence, and placed on a rocking culture platform that cyclically exposed the cells to air 50% of the time. Terminal differentiation was evident after approximately three weeks in culture. The 5-methylcytosine content of the DNA from differentiated human keratinocytes was 1.4%, whereas that of undifferentiated human keratinocytes was 3.1%. No difference in the 5-methylcytosine content of DNA as a function of the age of the donor was found.\r"

These two types of clones carried functionally different properties. Lyt-2+ clones were absolutely dependent on exogenous interleukin-2 for their proliferation, whereas some L3T4+ clones secreted interleukin-2 and proliferated autonomously. Both types of clones had cytotoxic activities to bm12 target cells, and Lyt-2+ clones showed stronger activities than L3T4+ clones. Lyt-2+ clones induced induration in situ, whereas the L3T4+ clones induced ulcerative reaction when injected intradermally into mice. Histologically, the L3T4+ clones caused necrosis of the epidermis or upperdermis, while the Lyt-2+ clones induced infiltration of small round cells through the epidermis to the subcutaneous tissues and caused thickening of the epidermis. These characteristic reactivities might be due to a difference in lymphokines produced by each type of T cell subset in response to Iabm12 antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Irritant contact dermatitis may be induced by many chemicals and has a far greater incidence than allergic contact dermatitis. Despite this, it receives relatively little attention and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To gain a greater understanding of the interaction of irritants with the skin, we investigated the histopathological changes resulting from the topical application of a series of structurally unrelated irritants. Human volunteers were patch-tested with appropriate concentrations of nonanoic acid, sodium lauryl sulphate, dithranol, benzalkonium chloride, croton oil, and propylene glycol, which produced generally mild to moderate responses. Biopsy specimens were taken after 48 h and examined by light and electron microscopy. Spongiosis and the infiltration of predominantly mononuclear cells were observed in the epidermis of the majority of biopsy specimens, and were particularly pronounced and extensive in croton oil reactions. In addition, several irritants induced distinct and characteristic patterns of keratinocyte damage. Nonanoic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate caused morphologic changes indicative of disturbances in keratinocyte metabolism and differentiation, giving rise to dyskeratosis and parakeratosis respectively, while dithranol induced marked swelling of keratinocytes in the upper epidermis. The results suggest that there is a diversity and specificity in the histopathology of irritant contact dermatitis, reflecting the different ways in which chemicals may interact with components of the skin.\r"

Thus, the results substantiated the extreme UV hypersensitivity of XP group A and D cells. However, XP52KO variant cells exhibited the normal level of UDS and ESS loss, but a slightly reduced repair of antibody-recognizing (6-4) photoproducts at 6 and 12 h after irradiation, which may account for a small UV hypersensitivity of the XP variant cells.\r"

All animals had reappearance of low levels of serum HDV RNA and transient, mild alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations, which in two cases correlated with HDV RNA positivity. Plasmas obtained from two chimpanzees after rechallenge were inoculated into two other chronic HBV carrier animals that had recovered from a previous HDV infection. A similar reappearance of HDV RNA in serum (without ALT elevation) was noticed. These same plasmas, however, when inoculated into a chronic HBV carrier chimpanzee never exposed to HDV caused a severe acute hepatitis D. Rechallenge with HDV in chimpanzees apparently recovered from a first HDV infection resulted in the reappearance of HDV replication, sometimes associated with hepatitis. This can be interpreted as reinfection with HDV, but other explanations are possible. Although the serum level of HDV RNA observed after rechallenge with HDV is low, its transmission to individuals susceptible to HDV infection can result in severe acute hepatitis D.\r"

In a previous study, these WHV genomes were induced to replicate and intact WHV particles were released when these PBLs were cultured in the presence of the generalized mitogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine whether the culture-derived WHV particles were infectious, adult woodchucks were inoculated with cell-free culture medium from either LPS-stimulated or unstimulated WC192 PBLs. None of three animals inoculated with medium from the unstimulated PBL cultures developed positive WHV serologic markers or elevated liver enzyme levels during a 42-w observation period. In contrast, all three animals that received medium from the LPS-stimulated cultures displayed serologic markers of acute WHV infections 8-10 w after inoculation at up to a 100-fold dilution of the original culture medium. One of the three infected animals developed an acute hepatitis coincident with the appearance of the WHV markers. These results demonstrate that the WHV particles released from LPS-stimulated WC192 PBLs in culture are mature, infectious virions that also cause liver disease. Thus the LPS-induced replication of WHV in these cell cultures represents a transition from a latent to productive viral infection.\r"

Of these, 82 subjects (55%) tested positive for antibodies to HIV. They were more likely to express hepatitis B \"e\" antigen (HBeAg) (P less than .001) and HBV-DNA (P less than .0005) in serum than were HIV-seronegative individuals. However, the degree of immune suppression did not influence HBeAg-HBV-DNA expression. In HBeAg-seropositive subjects, concurrent HIV infection was associated with lower serum alanine transferase levels (P less than .001). This effect increased with the degree of immune suppression as determined by CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Conversely, in patients negative for HBeAg, there was a weak trend towards higher alanine transferase levels with concurrent HIV. This study suggests that chronic hepatitis B may be less severe when accompanied by HIV infection; however, greater viral replication may make it more contagious and resistant to antiviral therapy. These data support an immune-mediated pathogenesis for hepatitis B and have implications for its control.\r"

The evidence linking EBV etiologically to these disorders includes the presence of EBV DNA and nuclear antigens in the lesions and serologic evidence that some patients with these lesions are experiencing primary or reactivated EBV infections. These syndromes may represent proliferation of cells latently infected with EBV, but the possibility of viral replication has not been rigorously studied. DNA extracted from biopsies of 35 lymphoproliferative diseases was probed with regions of the EBV genome capable of distinguishing circular, episomal DNA found in latency from linear, replicating EBV DNA. All samples contained restriction fragments characteristic of fused termini, indicative of circular, latent genomes. Thirteen samples contained additional restriction fragments diagnostic of linear EBV DNA. Therefore, replicating EBV DNA is found in approximately 40% of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known of the natural history of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in women from high-risk populations. Samples were collected from 183 Panama City prostitutes and assessed for HPV (filter in situ DNA hybridization) and for sexually transmitted agents. The cohort was followed for 8 mo; 51% of subjects completed four monthly return visits and 16% were sampled eight times. The proportion of women found infected with HPV increased significantly with increasing numbers of consecutive samples tested; 38 (21%) of 183 women were positive after one visit and 46 (82%) of 56 who completed six visits were infected. The pattern of viral detection over time was not random, which implied that most prostitutes were persistently infected with genital HPVs and that either scattered foci of infection or periodic reactivation of latent virus occurred. Our findings suggest that multiple sampling is necessary to accurately estimate HPV infection rates and to define whether patterns of DNA expression are present.\r"

In comparison to wild-type virus, the ca reassortant was restricted in replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of hamsters and chimpanzees. This clearly demonstrated that the six transferable RNA segments of the B/Ann Arbor/66 ca donor virus specify the attenuation phenotype for animals with a 37 degrees C core body temperature. In addition, the ca virus retained the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype after replication in hamsters and chimpanzees. To further evaluate its phenotypic stability, the ca reassortant virus was isolated after 6-15 d of replication in hamsters that were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, and the isolates were tested for their temperature sensitivity in vitro and for their level of replication in immunocompetent hamsters. The isolated viruses retained their ts and attenuation phenotypes even after prolonged replication in vivo. Thus, the B/Ann Arbor/66 ca donor virus can transfer the desired properties of attenuation and phenotype stability to its reassortants. The findings support the continued evaluation of ca reassortant influenza B virus vaccines in humans, including fully susceptible children.\r"

No pathogenic bacteria were found in fecal specimens; the virus particles detected by electron microscopy were morphologically indistinguishable from conventional infantile rotavirus. Immune electron microscopy showed that these virions formed large aggregates with convalescent serum and with the reference serum specific to group C rotavirus. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed similar RNA patterns for virus from this outbreak and typical group C rotavirus.\r"

Of 111 bactericidal titers in ultrafiltrate and/or Mueller-Hinton broth, 101 were within a single twofold dilution of titers in pooled human serum. Nine of 10 discordant titers involved highly bound drugs and were usually higher in ultrafiltrate than in pooled human serum. In seven additional volunteers with renal failure, titers in ultrafiltrate and in each volunteer's serum were higher than those diluted in pooled human serum (P = .002). Recommended methods using pooled serum diluent may not accurately predict actual bactericidal titers in patients with abnormal protein binding.\r"

  ".W": "The aerobic bacterial flora of the top 25 layers of the stratum corneum of normal human skin was characterized by sampling glabrous skin with contact plates and analyzing plasmid patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci (SCN) by agarose gel electrophoresis. The number of colonies of SCN on the skin surface at 12 sites varied from 14 to 838. Removal of five keratinized layers by sequential stripping with cellophane tape reduced the number of colonies by 80% (median; range, 42%-91%). Counts remained constant during removal of 20 additional layers. SCN with six different plasmid patterns were identified at a site on the skin surface. After removal of 25 layers, colonies with a single pattern were clustered in one quadrant of the site. The site was sterilized and covered with a sterile dressing for 18 h. Colonies reappeared in the same quadrant of the site; six of seven had the same pattern seen 18 h previously. Observations at three other sites were similar. Reappearance of the same strain(s) of SCN following sterilization of the site suggests that the reservoir for normal resident skin flora is located below the stratum corneum, perhaps in hair follicles and ducts of sebaceous glands.\r"

Two sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using alkaline phosphatase (AP)-or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were compared with solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) for detection of HPA. The AP-ELISA and HRP-ELISA were each positive in 17 (89.5%) of 19 urine specimens from patients with disseminated histoplasmosis, while the RIA was positive in 18 (94.7%) of 19. Specimens from patients with nondisseminated histoplasmosis were positive by AP-ELISA in 8 of 32, by HRP-ELISA in 4 of 25, and by RIA in 12 of 25. Of control specimens from patients with other fungal infections, the AP-ELISA was negative in 22 (91.7%) of 24, the HRP-ELISA in 23 (95.8%) of 24, and the RIA in 23 (95.8%) of 24.

The total component of each subclass was normal in most patients. IgG4 antibodies (measured by ELISA) were the most prominent parasite-specific response in both groups. Specific IgG2 and IgG4 responses were significantly more elevated in immunocompetent than in immunosuppressed patients. When the reactivity of each IgG subclass was analyzed by immunoblotting on SDS-PAGE-separated larval antigens, IgG4 recognized more antigens than did any other subclass. No parasite antigens were selectively recognized by either clinical group. Thus the continuous antigenic stimulation of chronic strongyloidiasis may result in an enhanced IgG4 subclass response. However, no presence or absence of humoral responses specific for filariform larval antigens was associated with the extraintestinal dissemination of the parasite.\r"

Intracisternally administered C5a caused a rapid, early influx of leukocytes into CSF that peaked at 1 h after injection; by 6 h, cell counts were slightly higher than those in controls. Administration of PGE2 or saline did not induce detectable CSF leukocytosis. Coadministration of PGE2 with C5a decreased CSF leukocytosis in a dose-related fashion. Protein concentration increased 30 min after administration of C5a, peaked after 1 h, and remained elevated for 6 h. PGE2 caused a dose-related increase in protein content after 2 h, whereas coadministration caused an inversely dose-related inhibition of the C5a-induced protein influx into CSF. These data suggest that PGE2 in the subarachnoid space exerts an inhibitory action on the C5a-mediated response that is probably not related to its direct effects on protein extravasation.\r"

Twenty-three patients suffering from idiopathic or immune infertility, polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), or mild endometriosis underwent follicular stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropin and/or pure follicle-stimulating hormone plus human chorionic gonadotropin prior to laparoscopic pickup of eggs of varying maturity. Eggs without spermatozoa were transferred at the time of laparoscopy. Subsequent high intrauterine insemination (IUI) of washed spermatozoa at a time when egg maturation within the tubes was judged to be complete enabled a cohort of fully capacitated spermatozoa to meet fully mature eggs in a totally physiological manner. Eight clinical pregnancies arose from this group, one healthy, male infant has been delivered, and four pregnancies remain ongoing. Although based on a small population of patients, it does seem that in vivo egg maturation following replacement in the fallopian tube is an effective alternative to in vitro maturation and, with the increased control over timing of egg insemination, leads us to propose FREDI as a flexible new therapeutic approach for the treatment of nontubal infertility.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine if transient, midcycle hyperprolactinemia exerted a deleterious effect on the number of oocytes retrieved or on fertilization of oocytes in vitro. Fifty-three infertile patients with midcycle hyperprolactinemia (PRL greater than 20 micrograms/liter) during ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF were compared with 53 matched controls who remained normoprolactinemic. Mean (+/- SE) serum PRL levels on the day after hCG were significantly higher in the study group (29.5 +/- 1 micrograms/liter) than in the control (13.1 +/- 0.5 microgram/liter) (P less than 0.0005), whereas the mean estradiol (E2) concentrations on the same day were not significantly different (4822 +/- 287 and 4492 +/- 269 pmol/liters, respectively). Fertilization rates (72 +/- 4 and 70 +/- 4%, respectively) and the mean number of oocytes recovered (4.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively) did not differ between the two groups. No correlation was observed between serum PRL and E2 levels, fertilization rates, or the number of oocytes retrieved in either group. Eleven patients with elevated PRL levels as a result of ovarian hyperstimulation were treated with 2.5 mg bromocriptine daily during the next IVF cycle. Serum PRL levels were significantly lower in the treated (5.6 +/- 1.8 micrograms/liter) than in the untreated cycles (35.6 +/- 3.1 micrograms/liter) (P less than 0.0005), whereas serum E2 concentrations did not differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report describes both gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) and pronuclear-stage transfer (PROST) of donated oocytes to patients with premature ovarian failure (POF), using micronized oral progesterone (P4) and low-dose micronized estradiol (E2) for endometrial preparation and maintenance. Patient A, with POF of 15 years' duration, received four donated oocytes for GIFT and subsequently delivered a normal, term, female infant. Patient B was diagnosed as POF 3 years ago. She received four donated oocytes, which were subsequently fertilized in vitro with husband's sperm. The following day, four pronuclear-stage embryos were transferred to her fallopian tubes. She recently delivered twin, healthy female infants. These procedures, along with exogenous hormonal development of the endometrium, provide a simplified means to establish and maintain pregnancy in POF patients. Both patients were maintained on low-dose micronized E2 prior to their procedure, Patient A on 3 mg E2 per day cyclically and Patient B on 0.5 mg E2 continuously. Micronized oral P4 was used to maintain pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Alternate protein sources have been suggested to replace the commonly used cord or patient serum for in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. During an 11-month period 127 patients treated for in vitro fertilization had either their serum (N = 71) or bovine serum albumin (BSA; N = 56) used as the protein source in the insemination and growth media. Ham's F-10 + 0.5% BSA was used for sperm swim-up and insemination media and 1% BSA was used for the growth media. Patient's serum was added to Ham's F-10 culture media at concentrations of 7.5 and 15% for insemination and growth, respectively. Embryo transfer was performed with Ham's F-10 containing 90% maternal serum in both groups. Fertilization rate of 259 oocytes inseminated in medium containing patient's serum did not differ when compared with 200 oocytes inseminated in medium containing BSA. Likewise, rates of abnormal fertilization, cleavage, and pregnancy were similar in both groups. In a second experiment, 148 normally fertilized oocytes were transferred after 24 hr in culture to growth media containing two different concentrations of BSA (0.5 or 1%). Cleavage rates for the two groups were similar and the percentage of embryos developed to greater than or equal to 4 cells did not differ significantly. We conclude that a single concentration of BSA can safely be used to supplement culture media in human IVF with several practical and economical benefits.\r"

  ".W": "There is currently a controversy as to whether the prolonged in vitro culturing of embryos before freezing has a deleterious effect on their ability to survive freezing and thawing. We compared the survival rate of frozen/thawed mouse embryos after in vitro culturing, from the two-cell stage through the eight-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages, with the survival of embryos developed in vivo to the same stages. Following induced superovulation and mating, embryos in the desired cleavage stage were flushed from the oviducts and/or uterus and either cultured in vitro or frozen immediately in sterile glass ampoules to -40 degrees C and plunged into liquid nitrogen for storage. Dimethyl sulfoxide (1.5 M) was used as cryoprotectant. After thawing, the survival rate (determined by the morphological appearance of the embryos) was significantly lower in the eight-cell stage embryos in the group grown in vivo (P less than 0.05). The number of embryos developing into expanded and hatched blastocysts was not significantly different when the in vivo vs in vitro cultures were compared over each of the three cleavage stages: eight cells (82 vs 83%), morula (92 vs 87%), and blastocyst (33 vs 51%), respectively. There was a significant decrease in the development rate of blastocyst-stage embryos when compared with earlier stages under both culture conditions (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that, compared to in vivo-grown embryos frozen at the same stages, prolonged in vitro culture does not reduce the embryos' ability to develop normally.\r"

The number of colonies formed by injection of 1 x 10(5) bone marrow cells into irradiated murine syngeneic recipients was similar to the previously reported results with 1 x 10(6) spleen cells. The results of this study with bone marrow-derived cells have been compared with those from studies done with spleen-derived cells. A significant increase (p less than 0.01) was observed in the number of granulocytic colonies formed by bone marrow cells versus spleen-derived cells. This suggests that bone marrow-derived cells promote granulopoiesis in the recipient spleen. A 50% increase of megakaryocyte colonies was observed within the splenic pulp in the midzone region when compared with that on the surface (p less than 0.01). This indicates that the splenic microenvironment in this area was conducive for megakaryocytopoiesis. These results provide further evidence of the influence of the microenvironment on hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "A long-term liquid culture system derived from adult Syrian hamster spleen that supports hematopoiesis from a single inoculum without supplemental coritcosteroids was used. Clonal assays from progenitor cells in the supernatant and adherent phases of liquid cultures revealed an increased concentration of myeloid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells in the adherent layer. Cell kinetic studies with these stable unstimulated cultures indicate that the initially labelling cohort of cells were present in the adherent cell layer. However, incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA occurred in less than 5% of the total cells present in the adherent cell layer. The data indicate that regulation of hematopoiesis by the stromal microenvironment was achieved by maintaining hematopoietic cells in a quiescent G0 or prolonged G1 phase and was associated with the initially labeling cells. The assays demonstrate the phenomenon that megakaryocyte precursors were present almost exclusively on the adherent stromal cell layer, which also contained a storage pool of mature megakaryocytes. The mature cells did not undergo further DNA synthesis and did not show morphologic changes of senescence. Cell kinetic studies revealed that megakaryocytes were released into the supernatant phase from the adherent stromal layer after endomitosis had occurred and cytoplasmic maturation ensued, indicating a role of stromal cells in megakaryocyte differentiation, maintenance, and maturation. The results of these investigations provide additional data on the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis by the microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "The role of complement in mediating the changes in renal hemodynamics and glomerular eicosanoid synthesis after the administration of heterologous antibody against rat glomerular basement membrane (AGBM) was studied in Munich-Wistar rats. AGBM serum decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased glomerular thomboxane B2 (TxB2) production without associated changes in glomerular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or PGF2 alpha production. Pretreatment of rats with cobra venom factor to deplete complement blocked the fall in GFR produced by AGBM without altering the increment in glomerular TxB2 production. In these animals, glomerular PGE2 synthesis was elevated. The results indicate that the salutary effects of complement depletion in nephrotoxic serum nephritis are not mediated by changes in the glomerular production of the vasoconstrictor TxA2. An enhanced production of PGE2 may participate in preventing the fall in GFR after AGBM administration in the complement-depleted rats.\r"

  ".U": "90010622\r", 
  ".W": "Qinghaosu, a potent antimalarial agent, has recently been shown to act via oxidative mechanisms. Hence, we have investigated what effect qinghaosu has on cellular oxidation in normal and oxidant-sensitive red blood cells (RBCs). At 500 mumol/L, qinghaosu was found to directly alter red cell deformability (DI) in both normal (hemoglobin AA) and abnormal (hemoglobins SS, AE, and EE) RBCs, with the maximum DI being 70% to 80% of that of untreated RBCs. Although concentrations of less than or equal to 200 mumol/L qinghaosu had a minimal effect on the maximum DI, qinghaosu was found to act as an efficient prooxidant at these concentrations. Cellular deformability was lost more rapidly in response to exogenous oxidants in the qinghaosu-treated RBCs than in control cells. Hemoglobin SS and EE RBCs pretreated with qinghaosu demonstrated a much more rapid decrease in cellular deformability than did the control RBCs in response to exogenous oxidants. Additionally, qinghaosu resulted in a dose-dependent increase in red cell lysis and methemoglobin generation while decreasing reduced glutathione concentration. As a consequence of qinghaosu challenge, a decrease in unsaturated fatty acids was noted. Deoxyqinghaosu, which lacks the endoperoxide bridge and is pharmacologically inactive, did not affect cellular deformability and did not function as a prooxidant. Additionally, deoxyqinghaosu had no effect on fatty acid composition, red cell lysis, methemoglobin generation, or reduced glutathione concentration. In conclusion, although the oxidative effects of qinghaosu on uninfected erythrocytes were only seen at concentrations much greater than that necessary for antimalarial activity, these results confirm the proposition that qinghaosu may act via oxidative mechanisms. Furthermore, qinghaosu-mediated oxidation was significantly increased in erythrocytes characterized by enhanced oxidant sensitivity caused by unstable hemoglobins.\r"

The highest levels of sIL-2R were observed in patients with acute and lymphoma-type ATL, as opposed to those with chronic and smoldering-type ATL. The levels of sIL-2R in patients with HAM were roughly between those of smoldering ATL and healthy HTLV-I carriers. Serum sIL-2R levels in healthy carriers were also elevated compared with those in normal controls. These observations suggest that the measurement of sIL-2R levels in patients with ATL can be useful as a noninvasive measure of tumor burden and should aid in the understanding of the natural history of HTLV-I infection leading to the development of ATL.\r"

  ".W": "Because heparin anticoagulation during hemodialysis with hollow-fiber devices is associated with progressive loss of volume of fiber bundles subsequent to thrombotic occlusion, we examined the antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of the irreversible synthetic thrombin inhibitor D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-chloromethylketone (FPRCH2Cl) during repeated exposure of cupramonium cellulose hollow-fiber hemodialyzers in an extracorporeal blood circuit in baboons. By contrast with full anticoagulating doses of heparin, FPRCH2Cl (100 nmol/kg/min) decreased both the loss of fiber bundle volume (19.1% +/- 7.0% vs 6.4% +/- 3.6% p less than 0.01) and deposition of 111In-labeled platelets within the dialyzer (15.7 +/- 5.9 x 10(9) vs 3.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(9) platelets; p less than 0.01). Additionally, blood markers of thrombus formation in vivo (i.e., plasma beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and fibrinopeptide A) remained at low levels throughout infusion of FPRCH2Cl, whereas levels were elevated during heparin therapy (p less than 0.01 in each case). FPRCH2Cl, but not heparin, prolonged bleeding times (p less than 0.001) without affecting the capacity of platelets to aggregate in response to the presence of either collagen or adenosine diphosphate ex vivo. Complement activation by the dialyzer was not affected by FPRCH2Cl. We conclude that the progressive loss of dialyzer hollow fibers is a platelet-dependent, thrombin-mediated process that, although resistant to heparin, is interrupted by the synthetic antithrombin FPRCH2Cl.\r"

Increased levels of blood carboxyhemoglobin and pulmonary aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in smoke-exposed animals indicated effective exposure of animals to cigarette smoke. Cathepsin B activity was quantitated with alpha-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-leucine-leucine-arginine-2-naphthylamide as substrate. Specific activity (nanomoles of substrate cleaved per milligram of protein per hour) in alveolar macrophages was increased by 43% at both 4- and 10-week exposure points in animals exposed twice daily to 10 puffs of cigarette smoke. These data indicate that maximal stimulation of the enzyme occurs within 4 weeks of the initiation of smoke exposure. When the activity was expressed on a per-cell basis, cathepsin B activity was also increased in the smoke-exposed group at both exposure points. Activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of smoke-exposed animals was increased by approximately 50% at 4 and 10 weeks, but the differences were not statistically significant. These findings demonstrate that cigarette smoke is a potent inducer of cathepsin B activity in alveolar macrophages of rats.\r"

Eight nonsmoking volunteers and 16 cigarette smokers without symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease were studied. All studies were initiated after a 6-hour fast, with the smokers also having refrained from smoking. Of the 16 smokers half smoked three cigarettes in the course of the experiments and half did not smoke. The immediate effects of cigarette smoking were a prolongation of the acid clearance time and a diminution of the secretion of salivary titratable base. However, both of these effects were overshadowed by greater baseline differences between the populations of smokers and nonsmokers. As a population the smokers had only 60% of the titratable base secretion of nonsmokers and acid clearance times that were 50% longer than those of nonsmokers. These effects were presumably long-lasting effects of cigarette smoking, although the duration of the effect was not defined. The observed differences in acid clearance are most likely the result of diminished salivary base secretion, since good correlation existed between these parameters.\r"

Blood pressure and heart rate were determined every 2-4 h using an automatic sphygmomanometer during an abrupt cessation of the previous beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug and commencement of treatment with enalapril 20 mg o.d. 12 h later. Mean blood pressure values at rest and during the hand grip test were lower when on enalapril, but heart rate was significantly higher, and three patients suffered from palpitations during the change. The change resulted in an improvement in cardiac function both at rest and during isometric work, as shown by echocardiography. A rapid decrease in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and an increase in renin activity were also seen after the change, while plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) decreased towards normal values. The results suggest that an abrupt change from a chronic beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug to enalapril is safe, feasible and is likely to produce favourable haemodynamic and hormonal effects in hypertensive patients.\r"

The age adjusted mean value of body mass index (kg m-2) in 1972 was 26.0 +/- 3.4 in men and 26.9 +/- 4.7 in women, increasing with age. During the 10-year follow-up the mean body mass index increased in men to 26.5 +/- 3.6 (P less than 0.001). In women we found a decrease in mean body mass index to 26.4 +/- 4.9 (P less than 0.001). The increase trend in body mass with age remained in women, while in men the age trend increased from survey to survey. The proportion of obese men also increased while in younger women a decrease was observed. The results of this study show the association between changes in physical activity, education etc. and the observed changes in the body mass index.\r"

  ".W": "To identify factors influencing the progression rate of chronic renal failure (CRF) in non-diabetics, the medical records of 124 patients with established CRF were reviewed retrospectively (serum creatinine between 200-350 mumols l-1 at the start of follow-up) for the period 1980-86. Sixteen patients were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. The remaining 108 patients were divided, using their original diagnosis, into four groups and were also assigned into one of three groups expressing their rate of progression. The definitions of these rates of progression were chosen arbitrarily. Comparisons with respect to mean arterial pressure (MAP), urinary protein excretion (UPE) and the progression rate of CRF were then made between the groups. In the group showing no progression of CRF (n = 17) there was a significantly lower MAP and UPE than in the two groups showing progression. Over all the patients and in the various diagnosis groups there was a strong correlation between UPE and the progression rate of CRF. There was no significant correlation between MAP and the progression rate of CRF in the diagnosis groups. These results indicate that an increasing magnitude of proteinuria is an adverse prognostic factor in CRF, irrespective of aetiology, and support the view that excessive glomerular protein filtration leads to glomerulosclerosis.\r"

Twelve patients were untreated, eight patients were treated with a low protein diet supplemented with essential amino acids, 11 patients treated with maintenance haemodialysis and 15 patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Patient data were compared to data obtained from 18 healthy subjects. Plasma cysteine was elevated in the untreated patients, in the patients treated with low protein diet and in the maintenance haemodialysis patients. Muscle methionine was significantly elevated in the CAPD patients. Plasma taurine was decreased in the untreated patients and in the CAPD patients and muscle taurine was borderline low in the untreated patients and significantly decreased in the other patient groups. The results show that taurine depletion may occur in patients with chronic uraemia despite normal or elevated concentrations of precursor sulphur amino acids, suggesting inhibited synthesis or enhanced degradation of taurine in the uraemic state.\r"

Eighty-eight consecutive patients (38 females; 50 males; mean age 47 years; range 15-86) seen in a renal clinic in a 13-year period with NS were studied. Eight of the patients had or developed MD. One patient had MD (medullary thyroid carcinoma) and NS diagnosed concomitantly and two patients had MD (both malignant lymphoma) diagnosed 19 and 21 months after the diagnosis of NS, respectively. In conclusion, only few patients in a renal clinic at debut of NS do have a simultaneous MD. Furthermore, their risk of developing such a disease is at worst only slightly raised.\r"

She suddenly suffered a paresis of the right arm, sudden blindness and her blood pressure fell to 100/60 mmHg. Hydrocortisone was given intravenously followed by betamethasone, and an Addison crisis as well as a giant cell arteritis (GCA) was suspected. Activity in the malignant lymphoma was also a possibility. The patient did not improve and died 8 d later. The temporal biopsy indicated GCA. The autopsy showed a pronounced intimal inflammatory reaction of the intracerebral arteries and an infarction in the left posterior hemisphere. A possible link between GCA and other autoimmune diseases is discussed.\r"

Treating women with positive results decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and possible prematurity. This study uses decision and cost analysis to compare the utility of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with not screening. Data are based on published reports and average charges for services. Costs are based on 1988 charges, projected for the expected results of outpatient screening, possible suppressive therapy, and risks of pyelonephritis. Screening is based on the combined sensitivities and specificities of the MacConkey and CLED (cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar) panels of the dip-slide culture. Under the baseline assumptions, the risk of pyelonephritis is estimated to be 2 cases per 100 screened women vs 3.5 cases per 100 unscreened women. The anticipated cost of screening 100 women is $9,939, compared with $12,824 for not screening 100 women. Screening is cost saving unless the cost of screening is above $26, the length of hospitalization for pyelonephritis is fewer than 2.2 days, the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria falls below 2%, the risk of pyelonephritis with asymptomatic bacteriuria falls below 13%, or the efficacy of treatment in preventing pyelonephritis falls below 38%.\r"

A retrospective chart review was undertaken to determine the prevalence of vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain in patients hospitalized for thyrotoxicosis at Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport, from 1982 through 1986. Of 25 thyrotoxic patients who had thyrotoxicosis diagnosed during or immediately prior to admission, 44% reported vomiting, 28% reported nausea, and 20% complained of abdominal pain. One or more of these abdominal symptoms were included as a chief complaint in 36% of cases reviewed. Further study of the clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis in the outpatient setting is needed to improve the timeliness and cost effectiveness of the clinical diagnosis of this condition.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between pregnancy complications and glucose levels in low-risk pregnant women. Based on 2-hour postprandial glucose testing at 27 to 33 weeks, 337 women with normal reproductive histories were divided into three groups: group A, glucose less than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), group B, 5.6 to 6.6 mmol/L (100 to 119 mg/dL), and group C, 6.7 to 9.1 mmol/L (120 to 164 mg/dL). Women with glucose levels greater than or equal to 9.2 mmol/L (165 mg/dL) were excluded. The groups were compared to detect differences in rates of various maternal outcomes (preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, forceps delivery) and neonatal outcomes (macrosomia, Apgar scores, prematurity, fetal death, infant death, congenital anomalies). No significant differences were found. These data indicate that variations in maternal glucose tolerance (within the normal range) are not associated with adverse outcomes in normal pregnant women.\r"

During a 1-month period 57 conferences were held, primarily for medical management problems. Sixty-one percent took place in the model clinic (3% of office visits) and 23% in the hospital (20% of admissions). A hierarchy of levels of involvement was found: the clinicians indicated that medical information and advice was most often provided \"a lot,\" emotional support was provided \"some,\" systematic assessment and intervention were provided \"a little,\" and family therapy skills were usually not used. Clinicians perceived the conferences to be usually useful to the patient, almost always useful to the family, and always useful to themselves. These results can provide information for future training, practice, and research.\r"

A recent British study also reported that women taking estrogen were less likely to die of all causes. Because of the many benefits of estrogen replacement therapy improving both the quality and quantity of life, all women who have this postmenopausal hormone deficiency, except possibly those who are obese, should receive estrogen replacement.

The three nonhomosexual groups were heterosexual, bisexual, and analloerotic (unattracted to male or female partners, but not necessarily devoid of all erotic behavior). A Core Autogynephilia Scale was developed to assess a subject's propensity to be sexually aroused by the fantasy of being a woman. The four transsexual groups were compared on this measure (and on several others), using Newman-Keuls multiple-range tests at p less than .05. As predicted, all three nonhomosexual groups were more likely than the homosexual group to report sexual stimulation by cross-gender fantasy. This finding supports the hypothesis that the major types of nonhomosexual gender dysphoria constitute variant forms of one underlying disorder, which may be characterized as autogynephilic gender dysphoria.\r"

Overall findings indicated that a mastectomy has the potential for affecting psychological, sexual, and social adjustment for at least a limited time post-operatively. Specifically, significant correlations were found between psychological, sexual, and social adjustment. Significant differences were also demonstrated in the married/nonmarried comparison. Additionally, results emphasized the importance of environmental support for postoperative adjustment.\r"

Caregivers selected as \"experts\" regarding eating disorders were rated as more efficacious than others, helping \"a little\" to \"somewhat.\"\r"

The authors studied 44 hospitalized patients with bipolar affective disorder, manic type. They report a significant association between more depressive symptomatology and perhaps younger age of illness onset, and poor immediate treatment response. They also found the total amount of psychopathology at admission, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Manic State Rating Scale, and the degree of psychosis to be unrelated to immediate outcome. The authors suggest that the not recovered manic subgroup has a distinct illness or a variant of bipolar disorder with poor prognosis that warrants further and separate investigation.\r"

Eighteen (29%) patients died, of whom eight had a thymoma (TH). Spontaneous improvement or remission occurred at any time during the follow up. At the end of the study (1985) 16 (22%) patients were in a complete clinical remission, 13 (18%) had improved considerably (3 with prednisone), 12 (16%) had improved moderately, 12 (16%) had remained unchanged and two had deteriorated. If the early deaths are excluded the outcome is similar in the early and the late onset group without TH. Patients with TH had a less favourable course. Associated autoimmune diseases were diagnosed in 25% (n = 58). Because most of these patients were treated with anticholinesterases only, the evolution of their clinical state represents the natural course of MG.\r"

In the present study, eight subjects with prior polio with more than 90% type I fibres in the TA were examined. The aim was to elucidate whether the lack of type II muscle fibres was due to a selective loss of motoneurons with high threshold and high axonal conduction velocity or due to a muscle fibre transition from type II to type I. There was no decrease of the proportion of motoneurons with high threshold and high axonal conduction velocity. Monoclonal antibodies against fast and slow myosin heavy chains (MHC) were used as histochemical markers and many muscle fibres of type I according to ATPase stainability showed a binding of both anti-fast and anti-slow MHC. It is suggested that the type I muscle fibre dominance in prior polio subjects with excessive use of TA during walking is due to a muscle fibre transition from type II to type I and not to a loss of one class of motor units.\r"

  ".W": "A refined technique is described for non invasive examination of the facial motor pathways by stimulation of the extra- and intracranial segment of the facial nerve and the facial motor cortex. Surface recordings from the nasalis muscle rather than from the orbicularis oris muscle were used, since the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from this muscle showed a more clearly defined onset. Electrical extracranial stimulation of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid fossa in 14 healthy subjects yielded a mean distal motor latency of 3.7 ms (SD 0.46), comparable with reported latencies to the orbicularis oris muscle. Using a magnetic stimulator, transcranial stimulation of the facial nerve was performed. The mechanism of transcranial magnetic facial nerve stimulation was studied using recordings on 12 patients who had facial nerve lesions at different locations, and with intraoperative direct measurements in four patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery. The actual site of stimulation could be localised to the proximal part of the facial canal, and a mean \"transosseal conduction time\" of 1.2 ms (SD 0.18) was calculated. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) played an important role in mediating the magnetically induced stimulating currents. Finally, with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial motor cortex, clearly discernible CMAPs could be produced when voluntary activation of several facial muscles was used to facilitate the responses. From this, a central motor conduction time of 5.1 ms was calculated (SD 0.60, 6 subjects).\r"

Twenty one patients (40%) had subclinical abnormalities of saccadic movement, supporting a diagnosis of probable multiple sclerosis. When used in addition to the measurement of visual evoked potentials and brainstem auditory evoked responses, the detection of subclinical abnormalities increased from 40% to 57%. The detection rate of abnormalities by saccadic eye movement recording was equal to that of visual evoked responses, but more than of brainstem auditory evoked responses. Prolonged latency of gaze was the most common saccadic latency abnormality detected. The majority of saccadic velocity abnormalities could be explained by disease in the medial longitudinal bundle. An unusual finding was that abduction velocity was increased in six patients. It is concluded that the simple measurement of saccadic eye movement is a valuable addition to other ancillary investigations for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. It also allows analysis of oculomotor function, commonly disordered in multiple sclerosis, but rarely investigated.\r"

The manual tasks consisted of naming objects palpated in either hand, transfer of postures from one hand to the other and writing. Consistent with predictions, the degree of ear asymmetry in dichotic listening performance was directly related to the severity of the head injury as reflected by the degree of impaired consciousness. Depth and localisation of parenchymal lesion characterised by magnetic resonance imaging were also related to the degree of ear asymmetry. Parenchymal lesions situated in sites which could potentially interfere with callosal auditory or geniculocortical pathways produced a greater disparity in response to left versus right ear inputs as compared with parenchymal lesions in areas such as the frontal lobes which are purportedly unrelated to asymmetries in dichotic listening performance. The results provide further evidence for the effects of multifocal brain lesions involving the white matter on tasks which require intra and/or interhemispheric integration.\r"

Of the patients, 88% had at least one definite electrophysiological abnormality: nerve conduction studies showed abnormal results in 43% (10 of 23), needle electromyography in 77% (17 of 22), and tibial somatosensory evoked potentials in 88% (7 of 8). The pattern of involvement was of scattered, multiple, bilateral thoracolumbosacral radiculopathies, consistent with axonal or neuronal destruction, associated with paraspinal fibrillations or abnormal activation of motor unit potentials. Electrophysiological abnormalities were seen in most patients with lower motor neuron clinical deficit. These abnormalities depended on the caudal extension of the AVM, on an arterial supply at T-10 or below, and on the duration of symptoms. In addition to the expected abnormalities in the distribution of the AVM location, four patients had electrical changes at a distance, which may have been due to venous stasis.\r"

Recently, increased attention has been paid to acquired stuttering of adult onset in the hope that the events associated with it might provide clues to the biological mechanism underlying stuttering. This attention has focused exclusively on the cortical substrates. We present our observations of acquired dysfluency, presumably of subcortical origin in a neurosurgical subject with intractable pain. The stuttering was relieved by thalamic electric stimulation. The effect of thalamic stimulation on the stuttering suggests that the pathophysiology of transient asynchronisation in the balancing and sequencing of multiple impulses is amenable to a diffusely orchestrated functional tuning of the thalamic and brainstem implicated subcortical structures and pathways.\r"

All these cases were treated with anticonvulsant drugs alone. A follow up scan was possible in 31 cases, 12 weeks or later, after the control of the seizures. Out of these 31 cases, 24 showed a complete or significant resolution and five remained unchanged. Two of these cases showed an increase in the lesions which resolved on treatment with antituberculous drugs. These lesions therefore may have an aetiology other than tuberculosis in the majority of cases and there is ample justification in treating them initially with anticonvulsant drugs only.\r"

Clinical features did not allow a separation of non ischaemic from ischaemic patients; however, hypertension was significantly more frequent in the latter group, and its positive predictive value in identifying ischaemic patients was 96.6%. Lacunar syndromes due to non ischaemic causes are not rare; since CT scan allowed appropriate treatment in two patients and demonstrated contraindications to antithrombotic therapy in five others, its early use appears warranted in patients with acute lacunar syndromes, particularly if normotensive.\r"

Muscle biopsy revealed a non-inflammatory necrotising myopathy. B. burgdorferi infection was confirmed by a considerable rise of specific IgG antibodies. A course of high dose steroids alleviated the myalgias, but paresis began to improve only after treatment with antibiotics. Our observations confirm that B burgdorferi can cause, through an undertermined mechanism, a necrotising myopathy, in addition to the wide spectrum of already known neurological complications.\r"

Controls were patients with peripheral fatiguing neuromuscular diseases and inpatients with major depression in a psychiatric hospital. Seventy-two percent of the CFS patients were cases of psychiatric disorder, using criteria that excluded fatigue as a symptom, compared with 36% of the neuromuscular group. There was no difference in subjective complaints of physical fatigue between all groups. Mental fatigue and fatigability was equally common in CFS and affective patients, but only occurred in those neuromuscular patients who were also cases of psychiatric disorder. Overall, the CFS patients more closely resembled the affective than the neuromuscular patients. Attribution of symptoms to physical rather than psychological causes was the principal difference between matched CFS and psychiatric controls. The symptoms of \"postviral\" fatigue had little ability to discriminate between CFS and affective disorder. The fatigue in CFS appeared central in origin, suggesting it is not primarily a neuromuscular illness. The implications for research and treatment of chronic fatigue are discussed.\r"

Four pure autonomic failure and four multiple system atrophy patients behaved similarly: tilting them sufficiently to induce significant orthostatic hypotension without causing syncopal symptoms led to a significant fall in their mean MCAv, but no change in their mean CBF. These findings suggest that cerebral autoregulation is preserved in autonomic failure, orthostatic hypotension resulting in a reactive vasodilatation which lowers MCAv, reduces vascular resistance, and maintains CBF. Ephedrine helped to correct the orthostatic hypotension, but had no direct effect on CBF. Two siblings with orthostatic hypotension secondary to dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency also had preserved cerebral autoregulation, but ephedrine led to paradoxical hypotension in these patients.\r"

The mean conduction velocity of the early wave was 66, SD 2.5 m/s. At high stimulus intensity this wave was followed by later and smaller waves, which travel at the same speed as the initial potential. The recovery cycle of the descending volley was studied by delivering paired cortical stimuli at time intervals ranging from 0.5 to 10 ms. The early wave evoked by the test stimulus recovered to about 50% at a 1 ms interval and to 100% at a 3.5 ms interval. The later waves could not be tested at short time intervals but with time intervals longer than 3.5 ms they recovered to 100%. It is suggested that the initial and later waves after scalp stimulation are equivalent to the D and I waves seen in animal experiments.\r"

The alpha percentage and various ratio parameters correlated significantly with Mini Mental State score, and delta percentage and mean frequency with the lengths of delirium and hospitalisation.

It was not always possible to determine if the signs and symptoms were due to local involvement by the epidermoid, increased intracranial pressure, or both. Diagnostic procedures evolved from angiography and ventriculography to non-invasive computed tomography and MRI. The posterior cranial fossa approach was used in 27 cases. Total excision of the epidermoid was the aim and was carried out in five (18%) patients but concern regarding the preservation of nearby important neurovascular structures forced partial removal in 22 patients. To minimise reformation, the residual epidermoid was carefully coagulated with the aid of the operating microscope and bipolar cautery without damaging surrounding neurovascular structures.\r"

The latencies obtained by magnetic stimulation were compatible with those obtained using high voltage electrical stimulation of the spinal nerve roots and always were shorter than the peripheral motor conduction time estimated by F-wave techniques. The site of activation by magnetic stimulation appears to be very similar to that stimulated by the high-voltage electrical method. Stimulation of descending motor tracts within the cord was not possible using the magnetic stimulator.\r"

Although the Parkinsonian group had previously exhibited slower reactions in a conventional simple reaction-time task, they were able to generate predictive responses that fell as close to the target onset as the controls' but showed greater variability. In a second experiment, Parkinsonian patients and controls made saccadic eye movements to a visual target that stepped at regular intervals between two fixed locations. After a few trials all the subjects tended to make predictive saccades that were initiated before the target excursion. However, the Parkinsonian group were slower to develop this strategy and when they did their saccades became considerably more hypometric than those of the controls. Both groups were able to maintain predictive responding even when the visual target disappeared and responses were paced by a buzzer. We concluded that Parkinsonian patients are capable of initiating predictive responses of the eye and the hand, at least in some circumstances, but such responses tend to be inaccurate in execution. This, in turn, may dispose the Parkinsonian patient against predictive movement.\r"

The movements were slower and for small amplitude movements, more variable than those recorded in normal subjects. The duration of the first agonist burst was prolonged, even when compared with normal subjects deliberately moving slowly. Cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscles during ballistic movements was common and may contribute to the bradykinesia. These findings are compared with similar studies of other diseases of the motor system. Unlike many other conditions which also reduce the speed of ballistic voluntary movements, the patients with dystonia in the present study showed a normal symmetry of acceleration and deceleration times. One interpretation of this finding is that aspects of the basic motor programmes are relatively preserved in this condition and account for the surprising retention of motor skills shown by some patients with dystonia.\r"

During 22 en bloc resections and six out of a total of 18 amygdalo-hippocampectomies, the activity of the hippocampus was also recorded by a multipolar strip electrode placed along its axis on the ventricular surface. Patients with mesial temporal pathology, chiefly mesial temporal sclerosis, made up the majority of those selected for amygdalo-hippocampectomy. They showed a characteristic ECoG pattern, with spikes localised to the mid part of the second and third convolutions and inferior aspect of the temporal lobe. Typically, this was associated with hippocampal discharges showing an anterior maximum. Pathology involving lateral temporal neocortex and non-specific findings were associated with more widespread temporal spikes and a maximum discharge amplitude over the mid and posterior parts of the hippocampus. It is suggested that intraoperative recording of the ECoG and hippocampal activity may provide a guide to the choice between en bloc resection and amygdalo-hippocampectomy.\r"

Stimulated submandibular flow accounted for only 27% of the total salivary flow. Chorda tympani section had no effect on submandibular flow in seven patients and only reduced submandibular flow by approximately 54% in the remaining 13 patients. No significant effect was observed on ipsilateral parotid flow rate. Electrogustometric taste detection thresholds were more than twice the accepted upper limit of normal on the lesioned side and taste recognition thresholds were also markedly abnormal. Chorda tympani section alone is a poor method of reducing stimulated salivary flow.\r"

The results confirm that steady plasma levodopa levels with stable motor control can be achieved. However, when patients were given oral protein loads, motor performance declined despite maintenance of plasma levodopa levels. These findings suggest that competition for levodopa carrier mediated transport by amino acids, is more important at the blood-brain barrier than across the gut mucosa; thereby possibly limiting the efficacy of long-term direct intraduodenal administration of levodopa.\r"

We have compared the two methods in 367 diabetic patients, 128 with symptomatic neuropathy. The Sensortek method was chosen for the forced-choice device, the Somedic modification of the Marstock method for a method of limits. Cooling and heat pain thresholds were also measured using the Marstock method. Somedic thermal thresholds increase with age in normal subjects, but not to a clinically significant degree. In diabetics Marstock warm threshold increased by 0.8 degrees C/decade, Sensortek by 0.1 degrees C/decade. Both methods had a high coefficient of variation in normal subjects (Sensortek 29%, Marstock warm 14%, cool 42%). The prevalence of abnormal thresholds was similar for both methods (28-32%), though Marstock heat pain thresholds were less frequently abnormal (18%). Only 15-18% of patients had abnormal results in both tests. Sensortek thresholds were significantly lower on repeat testing, and all thresholds were higher in symptomatic patients. Both methods are suitable for clinical thermal testing, though the method of limits is quicker. In screening studies the choice of a suitable apparatus need not be determined by the psychophysical basis of the test.\r"

The reasons for performing the myelogram were to identify the cause of a radicular lesion in 54% of patients, a chronic spinal cord lesion in 30%, an acute cord lesion in 9%, suspected disease at the level of the foramen magnum 6%, and for a variety of other conditions in 8%. For the 385 patients undergoing a myelogram in the study period, the median interval from admission to request, request to myelography and from myelography to discharge was nought, one and three days respectively. The proportion of patients submitted to myelography by individual consultants ranged from 7% to 28%. There was a two-fold variation in the delays in the time to requesting and performing myelograms. There was room for improvement in the clinical information supplied on the myelography request form. The role of ancillary investigations and their effect on myelography was unclear. Only 16 of the patients with suspected cord disease had visual evoked responses performed before myelography. Five of them had myelography after an abnormal result. The estimated annual direct cost of myelography in the unit was at least 486,000 pounds. Reorganisation might have yielded hypothetical \"savings\" of between 30,000 pounds (6%) and 155,000 pounds (32%), though in practical terms these \"savings\" represented resources which might have been freed for use in other higher priority clinical problems within the unit, rather than true reductions in monetary cost.\r"

The model was developed to test the hypothesis that IDPN-induced swelling increases the vulnerability of the distal axon to a second neurotoxic chemical insult. Rats were given a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of IDPN (1.5 g/kg) one week before receiving a single injection of AC (75 mg/kg, IP). Axonal degeneration was observed at multiple levels along the sciatic nerve at two weeks (with reference to IDPN administration), and was not progressive up to five weeks. Quantitation of degenerating fibers demonstrated that the extent of degeneration increased distally along the sciatic nerve. Single administration of either IDPN or AC did not produce degeneration. Thus, IDPN-induced neurofilamentous swellings alter the susceptibility of the axon to AC neurotoxicity. Two variations of this model were also studied. First, rats given five daily injections of AC (30 mg/kg, IP) beginning one week following IDPN administration developed accumulations of fast axonally transported materials in IDPN-induced microtubule channels. Second, rats given chronic injections of AC (30 mg/kg, IP, five days/week, for four weeks), to reduce the delivery of neurofilaments to the proximal axon, developed less prominent axonal enlargements when challenged with IDPN. Thus, axonal atrophy can mask the development of neurofilamentous axonal swellings.\r"

These patients had not been treated with antibiotics, either during the acute disease or during the interval prior to follow-up studies. The patients had exhibited the typical symptoms of Bannwarth's syndrome during the acute phase. At the follow-up studies, 33 patients showed no, and 23 only mild, clinical residual symptoms including normal CSF findings and low-positive serum IgG borrelia antibody titres (IFT; ELISA). Three patients without sequelae exhibited persistent intrathecal secretion of oligoclonal B. burgdorferi-specific CSF IgG antibodies (Immunoblot; positive borrelia CSF IgG antibody titres). Thirteen patients exhibited mild-to-medium sequelae with persistent intrathecal formation of oligoclonal B. burgdorferi-specific CSF IgG antibodies, up to 21 years after the acute illness. This persistence can be interpreted as an \"immunological scar syndrome\". Our follow-up studies appear to indicate that neurological manifestations of B. burgdorferi infections are generally (with few exceptions) of a benign nature. Most patients can be classified as having been cured without antibiotic therapy. No late manifestations of chronic progressive CNS borreliosis comparable to that of neurosyphilis have been seen following acute untreated neuroborreliosis.\r"

The CD4+CD8+ cell levels were closely related to the clinical change within 1 year after surgery in 8 patients who showed a preoperative elevation in the cell levels. This group of patients consisted of six thymomatous and two non-thymomatous patients; the latter were both negative for anti-AChR. The anti-AChR titres generally changed in parallel with the clinical state in 9 of the 16 patients who were followed up for more than a year after thymectomy, and the CD4+CD8+ cell levels were useful in predicting the clinical course in 6 of the above 9 patients and 3 other patients, including antibody-negative cases.

A close relationship was found between cerebrospinal fluid T4/T8 ratio and myelin basic protein in relapsing multiple sclerosis patients.\r"

Angiography was carried out with digital equipment and was usually limited to the vascular territory responsible for the neurological deficits. In 12 of 19 patients with internal carotid occlusion, the contralateral side was also studied. The angiographic abnormalities were classified as extracranial, intracranial, and combined extra and intracranial. The data show a high incidence (66%) of occlusive pathology of intracranial arteries, either isolated or associated with a significant presence of a potential embolic source (85%), and a high incidence of carotid occlusions located at the cervical segment (8 of 19). These observations suggest that most strokes are occlusive in origin.\r"

In the group of treated patients the reflex decay showed individual variations. The rate of recovery after prolonged stimulation (5 min) was slower in the patient group, especially within the first 30 s of recovery. With increasing age, the rate of decay rose in the patient group as well as in the control group. The technical parameters necessary for obtaining information of clear diagnostic value are indicated, with which it was shown that the continuous prolonged stimulation of the stapedial muscle is a practical and valid method for the evaluation of patients with myasthenia gravis.\r"

A collaborative placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study has now been carried out in 49 patients with biopsy-documented Alzheimer's disease. The results demonstrate a statistical improvement in Mini-Mental State scores and significantly slower performance on Trails A testing during drug infusion. Other neuropsychological test scores were not similarly affected. The degree of improvement was not sufficient to justify further treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients by intracerebroventricular infusion of bethanechol chloride. The drug delivery system used in the study was well tolerated, with two irreversible complications in more than 50,000 patient days.\r"

The approach to initial therapy included maximum feasible resection and radiotherapy. The median survival time for all patients was 35 weeks. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, duration of symptoms, preirradiation performance status, tumor histology, accessibility to resection, extent of resection, radiotherapy, and prior low-grade glioma were significant independent variables influencing survival. The prognostic importance of age, duration of symptoms, performance status, and tumor histology are already recognized, but three \"new\" findings are reported. First, patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma had the longest median survival time (278 weeks). Second, corrected for accessibility and all other variables, patients with gross total resection lived longer than those with partial resection, and patients with any degree of resection lived longer than those who underwent only a biopsy procedure. Third, patients with anaplastic glioma in whom there was a prior history of low-grade glioma lived significantly longer after the diagnosis of anaplastic glioma than did patients in whom the anaplastic glioma apparently arose de novo.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, Ropper reported that horizontal brain shift caused by acute unilateral mass lesions correlated closely with consciousness, and suggested that recovery of consciousness was unlikely to occur after surgical evacuation if the shift was insufficient to explain the observed diminution of consciousness. The authors have sought to confirm the correlation of pineal shift with level of consciousness and to assess the prognostic value of brain shift measurements in a prospective study. Forty-six patients (19 with subdural hematoma, 14 with intracerebral hematoma, and 13 with epidural hematoma) were accrued to the study group consecutively. A correlation was found between a decrease in the level of consciousness and a significant increase in the mean lateral brain displacement at the pineal gland (from 3.8 to 7.0 mm) and septum (5.4 to 12.2 mm). When outcome was examined in patients who were stuporous or comatose on admission, a significant increase in septal shift was found among patients with a poor outcome, but there was no significant relationship between outcome and degree of pineal or aqueductal shift. A poor outcome was more likely with effacement of both perimesencephalic cisterns or the ipsilateral cistern, but not the contralateral cistern, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. These results do not substantiate the value of brain shift as an independent prognostic factor after evacuation of an acute unilateral mass lesion. The decision to operate and the determination of prognosis should be based rather on established criteria such as the clinical examination, age of the patient, and the mechanism of injury.\r"

  ".W": "Direct therapeutic drainage and intracranial pressure monitoring from the posterior fossa has never been accepted in neurosurgical practice. Potential complications including cerebrospinal fluid leak, cranial nerve palsies, and brain-stem irritation have been a major deterrent. The authors placed a catheter for pressure monitoring in the posterior fossa of 20 patients in the course of posterior fossa surgery: 14 patients with acoustic schwannomas, four with posterior fossa meningiomas, one with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and one with a solitary cerebellar metastatic lesion. A Richmond bolt was also placed in the frontal area. Continuous monitoring of the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments was performed for 48 hours. During the first 12 hours the posterior fossa pressure was 50% greater than that of the supratentorial space in all patients (p less than 0.01). Over the next 12 hours the supratentorial pressure was 10% and 15% higher than the posterior fossa pressures in all patients, and by 48 hours of monitoring the pressures had equilibrated. There was no mortality or morbidity referable to insertion of the posterior fossa catheter. The conclusions drawn from this study are that: 1) direct monitoring and drainage of the posterior fossa is safe and effective; and 2) within the early postoperative period, the supratentorial pressures failed to reflect what is taking place within the posterior fossa. The implications and advantages of direct posterior fossa monitoring in the postoperative patient are discussed.\r"

The tumors were located mainly within the middle fossa in two cases and within the posterior fossa in two, and extended both supra-and infratentorially in four cases. Facial pain and hearing disturbance were the main symptoms, with various other symptoms such as focal seizures, hemiparesis, gait disturbance, increased intracranial pressure, and visual disturbance also being noted. All patients underwent radical tumor resection with either a transpetrosal transtentorial or orbitozygomatic infratemporal surgical approach; the approach depended on the topography of the tumor. Total removal was performed in all cases. Only one patient, treated early in the series, required a second operation to remove the tumor completely. In another case the tumor recurred 5 years after the operation. There has been no operative mortality, but injury or permanent damage to the trigeminal branches was inevitable in many cases. The surgical results were excellent in three patients and good in five.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of complex and surgically difficult intracranial aneurysms of the posterior circulation is now being performed with intravascular detachable balloon embolization techniques. The procedure is carried out under local anesthesia from a transfemoral arterial approach, which allows continuous neurological monitoring. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the balloon is propelled by blood flow through the intracranial circulation and in most cases, can be guided directly into the aneurysm, thus preserving the parent vessel. If an aneurysm neck is not present, test occlusion of the parent vessel is performed and, if tolerated, the balloon is detached. Twenty-six aneurysms in 25 patients have been treated by this technique. The aneurysms have involved the distal vertebral artery (five cases), the mid-basilar artery (six cases), the basilar artery (11 cases), and the posterior cerebral artery (four cases). The aneurysms varied in size and included three small (less than 12 mm), 15 large (12 to 25 mm), and eight giant (greater than 25 mm). Fifteen patients (60%) presented with hemorrhage and 10 patients (40%) with mass effect. In 17 cases (65%) direct balloon embolization of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent artery. In nine cases (35%), because of aneurysm location and size, occlusion of the parent vessel was performed. Complications from therapy included three cases of transient cerebral ischemia which resolved, three cases of stroke, and five deaths due to immediate or delayed aneurysm rupture. The follow-up period has ranged from 2 months to 43 months (mean 22.5 months). In cases where posterior circulation aneurysms have been difficult to treat by conventional neurosurgical techniques, intravascular detachable balloon embolization may offer an alternative therapeutic option.\r"

  ".W": "Transsphenoidal resection of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenomas has the potential of curing most patients with Cushing's disease. However, transsphenoidal exploration of the pituitary is not always curative, and patients who have remission of hypercortisolism following surgery occasionally develop a recurrence. Whether repeat pituitary surgery should be performed for recurrent or persistent Cushing's disease has not been evaluated previously. To determine the efficacy of transsphenoidal surgery in recurrent or persistent Cushing's disease, we performed transsphenoidal surgery in 31 patients (22 women and nine men) who had previously undergone a transsphenoidal operation and two female patients who had had previous pituitary irradiation only. In 24 (73%) of the 33 patients, remission of hypercortisolism was achieved by surgery. Although preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scanning identified an adenoma in only three of the 33 patients, in 20 patients a discrete adenoma was identified at pituitary exploration. The incidence of hypercortisolism was greatest if an adenoma was identified at surgery and the patient received selective adenomectomy (19, or 95% of 20 patients), if there was evidence at surgery or by preoperative CT scanning that the previous surgical exposure of the pituitary was incomplete (seven, or 78% of nine patients), if an adenoma was seen on preoperative CT scanning (three of three patients), or if the patient had had prior pituitary irradiation without surgery (two of two patients). In contrast, only five (42%) of 12 patients who received subtotal or total hypophysectomy had remission of hypercortisolim. Surgically induced hypopituitarism occurred in six (50%) of these 12 patients, but in only one (5%) of the 20 patients who underwent selective adenomectomy. Three (13%) of the 24 patients who were in remission from hypercortisolims following repeat surgery developed recurrent hypercortisolism 10 to 47 months postoperatively. Repeat transsphenoidal exploration of the pituitary and treatment limited to selective adenomectomy should be considered in patients with hypercortisolism despite previous pituitary treatment. If an adenoma is identified during surgery, the chance of remission of Cushing's disease is high and the risk of hypopituitarism is low; however, if no adenoma can be found and partial or complete hypophysectomy is performed, remission of hypercortisolism is less likely and the risk of hypopituitarism is about 50%.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the phenotypic profile of lymphoid cells freshly isolated from surgically resected human gliomas, a double-immunostaining technique was developed which permitted the investigators simultaneously to distinguish between hematogenous and tumor cell populations and to detect expression of lymphocyte-monocyte subset-specific antigens on hematogenous cells. With this technique, the profiles of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL's) derived from high- and low-grade gliomas were compared with phenotypes of lymphocytes concurrently isolated from peripheral blood. The total leukocyte cell yield from high-grade glioma cases exceeded that of low-grade cases. In nine high-grade glioma cases the proportion of CD8-positive cells was increased within the TIL population (41.2% +/- 1.9%, mean +/- standard error of the mean) as compared to the corresponding peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) population (30.8% +/- 4.1%, p less than 0.05). The proportion of natural killer HNK-positive cells, some of which bear the CD8 antigen (although not necessarily the pan T cell antigens CD2 and CD3), was also increased in the TIL's (41.9% +/- 4.2%) compared to that found in PBL's (32.1 +/- 5.6%, p less than 0.05) of high-grade glioma cases. The observed phenotypic pattern of high-grade glioma TIL's is similar to that reported based on immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue sections, suggesting that the techniques described here resulted in isolation of lymphoid cells representative of TIL's.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were localized and characterized in eight samples of human meningioma (four fibrous, two meningothelial, and two angioblastic types), using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. Effects of both growth factors on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis in the cultured meningioma cells were examined. High numbers of specific binding sites for both IGF-I and EGF were homogeneously present in tissue sections derived from fibrous and meningothelial types of meningiomas, whereas binding sites for these growth factors were not detectable in adjacent leptomeninges. While relatively large numbers of IGF-I binding sites were located in the wall of the intratumoral vasculature, the number of binding sites in the stromal component was lower in angioblastic-type meningiomas, including a low number of EGF binding sites detected only in the stromal portion. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites for both IGF-I and EGF in the meningiomas examined (dissociation constant (Kd) = 0.6 to 2.9 nM, and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) = 16 to 80 fmol/mg for IGF-I; and Kd = 0.6 to 4.0 nM, Bmax = 3 to 39 fmol/mg for EGF). Both growth factors increased the synthesis of DNA, in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. The combination of IGF-I and EGF synergistically stimulated the synthesis of DNA, and the effects seen with 10% fetal bovine serum could be reproduced at a concentration of 10(-10) M. These observations can be interpreted to mean that both IGF-I and EGF may be involved in the growth modulation of meningiomas, possibly through paracrine or autocrine mechanisms.\r"

In eight experiments solid tumor implants taken directly from surgical specimens were used, in four experiments the implants were made from early-passage monolayer cell cultures, and in four experiments both techniques were used. Successful tumor growth was observed in 10 (83%) of the 12 solid tumor implants and in six (75%) of the eight implants from cell cultures. The size and neovascularization of these tumors were serially determined over a 3-month period. Tumor doubling occurred in 1 to 3 weeks in all of the solid tumor implant group. In the group of six tumors successfully implanted from cell cultures, three doubled in 1 to 3 weeks and three grew more rapidly, reaching 10 to 20 times their original volume. Neovascularity occurred in the tumors within 3 weeks of implantation. Each of the solid tumor implants had a histological pattern similar to that of the corresponding original specimen. Only three of those implanted from cell cultures were similar to the original tumor; the other three displayed features characteristic of malignant meningioma. These studies suggest that implantation of human meningiomas in the subrenal capsule of the nude mouse is a feasible model that may be useful for evaluating hormonal or genetic modulation of tumor growth and for testing potential treatment regimens.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the relaxant effect of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37-amino acid peptide with a potent vasodilator action, on cerebral arterial spasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The spasm was induced by injecting autologous arterial blood percutaneously into the cisterna magna in adult mongrel dogs. The single-injection model of SAH was produced by injection of 1.0 ml/kg body weight of blood (on Day 0), and the double-injection model involved two successive injections of 0.5 ml/kg body weight of blood made 48 hours apart (on Day 0 and Day 2). On vertebral angiograms, arterial narrowing of the major cerebral arteries was most prominent on Day 3 after SAH in the single-injection model and on Day 7 in the double-injection model. When 10(-10) mol/kg of CGRP was administered intracisternally in the single-injection model on Day 3, the diameter of the spastic cerebral arteries, as determined by angiography, recovered to normal. After intracisternal administration of 10(-11) to 2 X 10(-10) mol/kg of CGRP on Day 7 in double-injection models, spastic cerebral arteries dilated in a dose-dependent manner. The dilatory effect of CGRP continued for a few hours after administration. The results suggest that CGRP injected intracisternally may reverse cerebral arterial spasm after SAH.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of indomethacin administration on the mortality rate of brain-injured rats was studied in four groups of animals subjected to a level of injury with a fluid-percussion apparatus predetermined to cause 50% mortality (50% lethal dose, or LD50). There were 24 animals in each of the following groups: 1) a control group, on which the LD50 was evaluated; 2) an ethanol-treated group with a mean blood serum level of 0.32 +/- 0.03 gm% (+/- standard error of the mean); 3) an indomethacin-treated group at a dose level of 3 mg/kg body weight administered intraperitoneally 10 to 15 minutes before injury; and 4) an indomethacin/ethanol-treated group. Significant differences in mortality rates were found in these experimental groups; namely, 50%, 58%, 8.3% (p less than 0.005), and 25% (p less than 0.05), respectively. The predetermined LD50 level of a 2.5- to 2.6-atm peak pressure pulse produced immediate apnea in all animals, which was either sustained (Type III), followed by temporary respiratory recovery (Type II), or followed by permanent resumption of breathing (Type I). The most important effect of indomethacin on respiratory function was manifested by a much higher percentage of Type I respiratory responses and a much lower percentage of Type II and III responses (hence a lower mortality rate). There was also a more rapid return to normal breathing in the postapneic period of recovery. Suppression of prostaglandin synthesis and of superoxide anion production at the of trauma may explain, at least in part, these favorable effects of indomethacin.\r"

  ".W": "The function-specific enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was tested for its protective effect in severe experimental fluid-percussion brain injury (4.45 +/- 0.10 atm) in 30 of 60 randomly selected male Sprague-Dawley rats. A respirator was used only in the event of need. The number of animals with permanent resumption of spontaneous breathing (Type I respiratory response) remained essentially the same in each group. However, when Type II apnea (cannot maintain recovery) and Type III apnea (never recovers from the initial apnea) were terminated with a respirator, all rats with Type II responses from each group were successfully converted to a state of sustained spontaneous breathing. In contrast, only five (41.7%) of the 12 rats with Type III response were salvaged in the control group while five (83.3%) of six Type III rats in the SOD-treated group were saved. The results reveal the nature of the therapeutic effectiveness of superoxide radical scavengers in the overall outcome of head injury in this animal model. While SOD alone did not increase the number of spontaneous survivors, the drug shifted a number of animals from the critically injured rats with Type III respiratory response to the less critical Type II condition. Whereas induced respiration as the sole therapy in the control group lowered the mortality rate to 23.3%, respiratory assistance together with SOD treatment reduced the \"mortality\" to a single animal with Type III apnea (3.3%) which was alive but still required the respirator after 2 hours (p less than 0.001). The results show that respiratory assistance alone accounted for a 33% decrease in mortality rate and that SOD, given in addition to induced ventilation, further decreased mortality by 20%. Since SOD enzymes are reactively specific for superoxide, the increased survival rate of the brain-injured rat must have been due either to preventing or to minimizing pathophysiological changes, probably in the brain stem, caused by oxygen free radicals.\r"

Nerve stumps that had been transected without implantation into fat tissue served as control experiments. At 4, 8, or 24 weeks postoperatively, the rats were sacrificed and the neuromas at the transected nerve ends together with the adjacent fat tissue were studied after intra-aortal perfusion fixation. Light microscopy revealed no significant difference in neuroma size between the two groups. In most animals with fat implantation, however, infiltration of fat tissue beyond the margins of the solid neuromatous bulb by regenerating nerve fibers was limited to rare axons growing along blood vessels and connective tissue strands. In only a few instances was the fat tissue itself invaded by minifascicles as was usually seen in the connective tissue surrounding control neuromas. It is concluded that diffuse outgrowth of nerve fibers is limited to some extent by fat tissue, which, however, is not an impermeable barrier for regenerating nerve fibers. Nevertheless, in a fat tissue flap, the neuroma is placed in a \"soft pressure-free bed\" which might be a prerequisite for permanent diminution of pain sensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "90011307\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that hyperglycemia, particularly that induced by exogenous glucose administration, exacerbates neurological deficits in the rat spinal cord ischemic model. The effect of inhibition of glucose uptake (glucose transporter) and initial metabolism (hexokinase) on neurological outcome was evaluated in the present investigation using the competitive inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG). Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200 to 300 gm each, received either 0.25, 1, or 2 gm/kg 2-DG; 2 gm/kg 3-OMG; 2 gm/kg glucose; or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline intraperitoneally. Rats were intubated and ventilated with 1% to 1.5% halothane. The aortic arch was exposed and snares were placed on the right and left subclavian arteries and the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. The three vessels were occluded for 10, 11, 12, or 13 minutes. Lower-extremity neurological deficits were evaluated at 1, 4, 18, and 24 hours postocclusion based on a 15-point scale (normal = 0, severe deficit = 15). Lower-extremity neurological deficits were significantly less severe in the groups treated with 2-DG (0.25 and 1 gm/kg) at 18 and 24 hours postocclusion (p less than 0.05 for 0.25 gm/kg and p less than 0.005 for 1 gm/kg, Student's t-test with Bonferroni correction). The lower 2-DG dose of 0.25 gm/kg did not significantly increase the plasma glucose level, suggesting that the glucose transporter was not markedly inhibited, and that the improved neurological outcome was more likely due to inhibition of hexokinase. The higher 2-DG dose of 1 gm/kg afforded protection despite significantly increasing the plasma glucose level, implying a strong inhibition of both the glucose transporter and hexokinase. Administration of 3-OMG, which only inhibits glucose uptake and not hexokinase, actually worsened the neurological deficit in a manner similar to that observed in rats treated with glucose. The authors conclude that the activity of the glucose transporter by itself does not significantly contribute to hyperglycemic exacerbation of neurological deficits. In contrast, the hexokinase step, at least in combination with the transporter and possibly alone, plays a significant role in hyperglycemic exacerbation of the lower-extremity neurological deficit in the paraplegic rat.\r"

Mean ratings of cortical and ventricular atrophy on CT and of metabolic abnormality on PET were significantly different (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0001, respectively) between two subject groups, however, there was a considerable overlap in reading of cortical atrophy. CT hypodensities were present in 17% of DAT patients and 12% of controls. MR revealed numerous additional periventricular and deep white matter signal changes. Neither hypodensities nor hyperintensities were correlated with PET abnormalities. Although, not infrequently, hypometabolic areas on PET scans corresponded to atrophic regions on anatomic images, they also occurred without such changes. Interestingly, cortical high signal intensity seen on MRI was frequently observed to be associated with areas of hypometabolism. Our results suggest that PET may be the most sensitive modality for detecting cortical involvement in DAT.\r"

In 9/15 studies there was no intracranial flow present and brain death was then confirmed by standard criteria. Of the remaining 6/15 studies which showed evidence of cerebral perfusion, 3/6 patients underwent a subsequent HM-PAO study which showed cessation of perfusion. One additional patient died of pneumonia and two patients survived. Thus, in all cases where there was no flow present the diagnosis of brain death was later confirmed whereas three patients clinically thought to be brain dead showed significant perfusion and survived the cerebral trauma. HM-PAO may be useful in determination of brain death because it provides unequivocal results, can be performed by planar imaging at the bedside, and does not require withdrawal of medical therapy, thus allowing a diagnosis to be established more rapidly.\r"

  ".W": "We performed 38 cerebral perfusion studies in 33 patients with brain death or with severe central nervous system injury using technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime [( 99mTc]HM-PAO). Uptake by the cerebrum and/or cerebellium was present in all patients who were not clinically brain dead (ten studies) although the study was often abnormal. In those patients who were brain dead, 16/17 studies demonstrated no uptake in either the cerebrum or cerebellum. In patients suspected of brain death, but who had conditions interfering with the diagnosis the test demonstrated no uptake in 9/11 studies, confirming brain death. A radionuclide angiogram (RNA) of the head was also performed in 33/38 studies and showed complete agreement with the [99mTc]HM-PAO uptake, except in one case. We conclude that cerebral perfusion imaging with [99mTc]HM-PAO is a simple, noninvasive and reliable test to confirm brain death. By comparison with conventional technetium agents, [99mTc]HM-PAO is not dependent on the quality of the bolus injection, is easier to interpret and allows evaluation of posterior fossa blood flow.\r"

Eleven out of 27 patients were also studied using a nonspecific control antibody (11.4.1) of the same immunoglobulin subclass and observable tumor localization was also achieved in five patients. The specificity of targeting was assessed by comparing images obtained with specific and nonspecific antibodies and by examining tumor and normal tissue biopsies after dual antibody administration. Ten patients with recurrent grade III or IV glioma who showed good localization of radiolabeled antibody were treated with 40-140 mCi of 131I-labeled antibody delivered to the tumor area intravenously (n = 5) or by infusion into the internal carotid artery (n = 5). Six patients showed clinical improvement lasting from 6 mo to 3 yr. One patient continues in remission (3 yr after therapy), but the other five who responded initially relapsed 6-9 mo after therapy and died. No major toxicity was attributable to antibody-guided irradiation. Targeted irradiation by monoclonal antibody may be clinically useful and should be explored further in the treatment of brain gliomas resistant to conventional forms of treatment.\r"

Results of RIS were compared to those of a comprehensive diagnostic study. Final diagnosis was based on surgery, biopsy and autopsy (n = 39) or follow-up findings (n = 18). Three groups of patients were defined: Group A with suspected primary tumors (n = 11), Group B with probable (n = 19) and Group C with questionable (n = 27) tumor relapse. Eighty-eight per cent, 93% and 71% of the anatomic regions studied were correctly identified as being involved, and 97%, 97%, and 87% as being free from tumor in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. In the 27 patients from Group C with no definite diagnosis of relapse, and in whom diagnosis was most difficult, 38 tumor sites were involved. Of these, 21 were detected by both prospective RIS and repeated comprehensive study, six by RIS only and seven by conventional methods only. Four sites remained undetected by both approaches. Ten of the 21 lesions were detected by RIS more than 1 mo earlier than by any other method. Among the seven tumor sites detected by other diagnostic modalities only, three were identified at the time of RIS and four became positive more than 6 mo later. Overall diagnosis was entirely correct in 30, partially correct in 16 and incorrect in six patients studied. RIS with ECT and 123I-labeled anti-CEA MAb allows early detection of recurrence or metastasis of colorectal cancer. It thus contributes to reduced delay between diagnosis and treatment.\r"

By dividing the peak power by the time elapsed from the beginning of ejection to the peak power point, the ejection rate of change of power (ERCP) was calculated. The ability of this index to assess left ventricular function at rest and exercise was evaluated in ten healthy subjects. ERCP proved to be more sensitive than global left ventricular ejection fraction increasing fivefold from rest to exercise compared with only 20% increase in global ejection fraction. ERCP increased dramatically postexercise from 3411 +/- 2173 to 18,162 +/- 14,633 gm/sec2, median 12,750, 95% confidence interval 9700-29,600, in healthy, while in patients it increased twofold from 2637 +/- 824 to 5062 +/- 1897 gm/sec2, median 4070, 95% confidence interval 2800-7030, p less than 0.001. ERCP had an excellent discriminative power in differentiating healthy subjects from patients, having 100% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 95% accuracy, 95% positive predictive value, and 90% negative predictive value. Thus, this noninvasive index seems to have a more comprehensive ability to evaluate changes in left ventricular function and shows a promising potential for clinical applications.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate geometric distortion when 180 degrees or 360 degrees angular sampling techniques are used in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a study of point sources imaged at different positions in a water filled cylindrical phantom, and reconstructed using filtered back projection, was conducted. A simulation study, based upon a serial model of the system point spread function (PSF), was used to investigate the contributions of attenuation, spatial resolution and scatter on distortion of the reconstructed PSFs. To study the geometric distortion in transverse (x-y plane), coronal (x-z plane), and sagittal (y-z plane) sections, the ratios of the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) and full widths at tenth maximum (FWTM) in the x/y, x/z, and y/z directions were calculated for the real and simulated PSFs. These results showed that, in an attenuating medium, there is more distortion of point sources into ovals for 180 degrees than for 360 degrees sampling. The simulation study indicated that the primary cause of geometrical distortion in SPECT studies, is the inconsistency of projections due to variable attenuation and spatial resolution. The impact of scatter on geometric distortion was small as measured by the ratios of FWHMs and FWTMs for PSFs. Attenuation correction applied to acquired PSFs significantly reduced geometric distortion in both 180 degrees and 360 degrees studies. To investigate distortion in extended objects, an Iowa heart phantom was placed inside an Alderson body phantom and 201Tl heart SPECT studies acquired. The phantom images confirmed the conclusion that in transverse sections of 360 degrees studies with arithmetic averaging of opposite views, geometric distortion is reduced compared to 180 degrees. The coronal and sagittal sections were equally distorted in both, the 180 degrees and 360 degrees studies, and the 180 degrees studies yielded better contrast.\r"

Each of these complexes were co-administered with [125I]albumin by i.v. injection and their biodistribution was studied in Wistar rats. The plasma clearance of 59Fe and [125I]albumin was monoexponential with half-times of 49-70 and 277 min, respectively. The plasma clearance of 68Ga and 111In was biexponential with second component half-times of 157 and 232 min, respectively. Indium-111 tissue distribution was similar to that of [125I]albumin in heart, lung, muscle, brain and Walker-256 allograft. Iron-59 distribution spaces were generally the highest of the metal complexes in all tissues except muscle, where the 68Ga space was highest. The effects of transferrin-specific receptor-mediated endocytosis can be avoided in many organs and Walker-256 allografts by using the indium-transferrin complex, and the radiolabeled complex may be a convenient macromolecular tracer to estimate vascular permeability and vessel pore size in tumor and systemic tissue. In contrast, the iron-transferrin complex may be useful for measuring and imaging transferrin-specific receptors in brain and tumor tissue.\r"

Compared to the 111In-labeled antibody DTPA with a peptide linkage, the diester conjugate cleared much faster from the blood and was retained much less in muscle and normal organs such as liver, spleen and kidney over a 48-hr period. On the other hand, the activity retained in the tumor was larger than or similar to that of the peptide conjugate for this time period. This resulted in a 2.5, 2.1, and 2.6 fold increase in a tumor to blood, to liver and to kidney ratio at 48 hr for the diester conjugate as compared to the peptide conjugate. The whole-body biologic half life of the antibody was 36 hr, three times shorter than the peptide conjugate. The external imaging demonstrated a clearly visible tumor at 4 hr and a lower pool activity at 72 hr for the diester conjugate. The peptide conjugate, however, showed a persistant blood-pool activity at 72 hr. The addition of the diester linkage, therefore may be beneficial for imaging tumors in patients at early time intervals after injection.\r"

However, the ability of this method to actually quantitate PSS in the presence of cirrhosis and propranolol has not been demonstrated. We studied nine dogs with hitologically proven cirrhosis induced by chronic bile duct ligation. After intravenous injection of propranolol, PSS were measured with both the IMP method and the standard of portal vein infusion of 99mTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA) given through a mesenteric vein catheter. Based on linear regression, a close relationship was seen, given by the equation: MAA = IMP 0.9 + 0.035, with correlation coefficient of 0.99. Thus, in dogs with cirrhosis secondary to chronic bile duct ligation and after propranolol administration, PSS can be quantitated with the transrectal IMP method.\r"

Data were acquired in frame mode in the hepatic region and both lung bases for 5 min after rebreathing 20 mCi of gaseous 133Xe and for another 5 min during washout. Static [99mTc]sulfur colloid liver imaging was performed with the patient in the identical position immediately after the ventilation study and data were stored for liver localization. A hepatic time-activity curve corrected for background activity was generated. The 133Xe retention ratio was derived by dividing the activity at 3.5 min after washout by the peak activity. The data of 16 controls and 20 patients with fatty liver were analyzed. The retention ratio (mean +/- s.d.) was greatly increased in patients with fatty infiltration (0.43 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.08 in controls, p less than 0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between the 133Xe retention ratios and percentage of fat on biopsy as assessed by the amount of the liver tissue occupied by fat globules on H & E stained sections. The 133Xe hepatic retention ratio is a simple, accurate and clinically useful index of detecting, quantifying and managing fatty infiltration of the liver.\r"

  ".W": "A new cause of artifactual 201Tl defects on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) termed \"upward creep\" of the heart is described. In 102 consecutive patients undergoing 201Tl SPECT, 30 (29%) demonstrated upward creep defined by an upward movement of the heart of greater than or equal to 2 pixels during acquisition. In 45 consecutive patients with a less than 5% likelihood of coronary artery disease, 17 (38%) had upward creep. Of these nine had reversible 201Tl defects localized to the inferior and basal inferoseptal walls, while none of the 28 without upward creep had defects. The 17 low likelihood patients with upward creep had longer exercise duration and higher peak heart rate than those without upward creep. In five additional low likelihood patients with upward creep in whom imaging was immediately repeated, the upward creep pattern disappeared on the repeated images. After we changed our test protocol to begin imaging 15 min postexercise, only five (14%) of 36 low likelihood patients tested demonstrated upward creep. Upward creep is probably related to a transient increase in mean total lung volume early following exhaustive exercise, resulting in a mean lower position of the diaphragm (and thus the heart) at the beginning of imaging. The frequency of this source of false-positive 201Tl studies can be reduced by delaying SPECT acquisition until 15 min postexercise.\r"

Since caffeine has been reported to be a competitive antagonist of adenosine we studied the effect of caffeine on the outcome of dipiridamole-201Tl cardiac imaging in one patient. During caffeine abstinence dipyridamole induced myocardial ischemia with down-slope ST depressions on the ECG, and reversible perfusion defects on the scintigrams. When the test was repeated 1 wk later on similar conditions, but now shortly after infusion of caffeine (4 mg/kg), the ECG showed no, and the scintigrams only slight signs of ischemia. We conclude that when caffeine abstinence is not sufficient, the widespread use of coffee and related products may be responsible for false-negative findings in dipyridamole-201Tl cardiac imaging.\r"

To examine this question further, adult rats were fed diets providing ratios of CHO:FAT as a percentage of energy of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0 for 6 wk. Mean energy and protein intakes were 93.0 +/- 0.8 kcal/d and 5.3 +/- 0.1 g/d, respectively. Final body weight was lower in rats fed the high fat diet (CHO:FAT, 0.5) than in rats fed the high carbohydrate diet (CHO:FAT, 3.0) (P less than 0.05), and a linear response was observed over the entire range of treatments (r = 0.92). Rats fed the high fat diet had the highest nitrogen balance; values were significantly (P less than 0.05) different from those of rats fed high carbohydrate diets (CHO:FAT, 2.0 or 2.5) when expressed as mg nitrogen/kcal energy gain. Rats fed the high fat diet had the highest protein gain and the lowest fat gain as a function of energy gain. It is concluded that alterations in nonprotein energy source result in metabolic changes, which may be related to adaptations in energy expenditure and/or protein deposition.\r"

Fecal excretion of inorganic cations (Mn++, Mg++, Cu++, Fe , Zn++, Na+ and K+) was greater in rats fed blackgram NDF than in rats fed a fiber-free diet. Absorption of glucose and cholesterol was lower in rabbits fed blackgram NDF than in rabbits fed a fiber-free diet. In vitro studies revealed significant binding of inorganic cations and bile acids by blackgram NDF. Cholic acid may be adsorbed on the surface of blackgram NDF.\r"

In expt. 2, the subjects (n = 11) received 1 g fat/kg body wt as 50% soybean oil + 50% cream, and the meal was supplemented with 200% of the RDA for fat-soluble vitamins. The ratio of gamma- :alpha-tocopherol given in the test meal of expt. 1 was 2.8:1 and in expt. 2 was 0.9:1. Blood samples were obtained 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after the meal. Tocopherol concentration was measured in plasma and lipoprotein fractions. In both studies, plasma triglyceride concentration increased significantly after the meal (P less than 0.001). Mean plasma cholesterol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were unchanged, but plasma gamma-tocopherol concentration was significantly increased at 6, 9 and 12 h after the meal (P less than 0.05). The increase in plasma gamma-tocopherol was due to increases within the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction (d less than 1.006 g/ml) at earlier timepoints, followed by a sustained increase within low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions at later timepoints. In contrast, alpha-tocopherol in LDL and HDL decreased postprandially, concomitant with a rise in TRL alpha-tocopherol. Our results are consistent with the concept that there are differences in the distribution of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in postprandial lipoproteins.\r"

These effects were compared with those of penicillamine, a chelating agent utilized in the therapy of the genetic abnormality of copper metabolism in humans, Wilson's disease. Cobalt elicited an increased (approximately 4-fold) urinary excretion of copper lasting through 72 h following a single cobalt dose. In contrast to the marked increase in urinary zinc excretion produced by penicillamine, cobalt greatly reduced (approximately 75%) zinc output in urine. Tissue copper and zinc concentrations were measured after treatment with cobalt at doses ranging from 12 to 60 mg/kg body weight. Substantially reduced (approximately 25%) renal copper concentration was observed at 1 and 3 d after cobalt administration. In addition, cobalt produced a concurrent dose-dependent elevation (up to 1.6-fold) in hepatic zinc concentration. Cytosolic zinc was eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in the molecular weight region associated with metallothionein. Time-dependent induction of metallothionein concentration (10-fold) in liver by cobalt was confirmed by the cadmium/hemoglobin affinity assay. The ability of inorganic cobalt to elevate zinc concentration in liver and produce increased urinary copper excretion without the zincuresis that normally accompanies penicillamine administration represents a newly defined biological property of this essential trace metal.\r"

The tissues represented are adipose, central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreatic and salivary glands (PSG), reticuloendothelial system (RES) and skin, together with a blood pool of amino acids. The fluxes represented in the equations are generally assumed to follow simple or modified mass-action kinetics. The fractional rates for protein synthesis in each tissue were calculated from published values for lambs, where these were available, or alternatively derived using assumptions based on data obtained with rats. The initial protein content of each tissue and the fractional degradation rate were assigned values calculated using data from a slaughter experiment. The model was used to examine whole-body protein synthesis at different rates of growth and to compare the relative contributions of each tissue. The GIT (25-26%) and skin (23-26%) had the highest contributions to total protein synthesis, followed by muscle (21-26%), liver (13-14%), RES (6-7%) and PSG (3-6%), while adipose, CNS, heart and kidney together contributed less than 5%. These values agree reasonably well with experimental values, and thus the model can be used to examine the effect of different growth rates on protein metabolism and its associated energy costs.\r"

Protein turnover accounted for 19% of whole-body ATP expenditure at both growth rates examined, with the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), accounting for 25-27%, muscle for 21-26%, skin for 23-26% and liver for 13% of total protein turnover energy costs.

Thus, protein turnover accounted for 19% of the increment in ATP expenditure due to the increased nutrient input at the higher rate of growth, while Na+,K+-transport accounted for 39%, and fat turnover and accretion accounted for 25%, leaving 17% of the ATP increment unaccounted for.\r"

Administration of sucrose (5.52 mol/kg body wt), or the monosaccharides (11.04 mol/kg body wt) glucose, galactose or fructose, elicited prompt GIP responses that peaked at 30 min. Similar effects were induced by 3-O-methylglucose or alpha-methyl-glucoside, but the stimulatory action of 2-deoxyglucose was delayed. In contrast to the other sugars, N-acetylglucosamine decreased plasma GIP concentration, while mannose exerted no effect. The results suggest that sugars using the Na+ glucose contransporter at the luminal brush border stimulate GIP release without the necessity of being metabolized or removed from the cell by the glucose transporter at the basolateral membrane. The ability of fructose to stimulate GIP release in ob/ob mice suggests that the Na+-glucose contransporter does not represent an exclusive trigger for sugar-induced GIP secretion.\r"

In hepatocytes from female rats fed a 60% sucrose or fructose diet, the rate of lipogenesis was two times higher than in cells from rats fed a 60% glucose diet and three times higher than in cells from rats fed a commercial nonpurified diet. In hepatocytes from rats fed the fructose-containing diets, lactate was a better substrate than either butyrate or acetate, whereas in cells from rats fed either the glucose diet or the non-purified diet, butyrate was the best lipogenic substrate, and the lipogenic potential of lactate and acetate was similar. In all cases, 1 mM fructose caused a 30-40% stimulation of lipogenesis, while 10 mM glucose did not enhance fat synthesis above the endogenous rates. These results suggest that the differential effect of fructose-containing diets on hepatic lipogenesis results from activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby increasing the efficiency by which lactate is used as a carbon source for fatty acid synthesis. The differences in lipogenic potential of the various substrates tested is discussed.\r"

Mice were fed purified diets containing either 0% fat (fat free), 5 or 20% safflower oil or 5 or 20% palm oil. Safflower oil and palm oil were used because they are comparable in carbon chain length but vary in the amount of linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)]. Cytotoxicity of splenic NK cells from mice stimulated or unstimulated by the interferon inducer poly I:C was measured against either the YAC-1 lymphoma or line 168 mammary tumor targets. The number of asialo GM1+ cells was not influenced by concentration or degree of saturation of dietary fat. Generally, dietary fat had no consistent influence on NK cell cytotoxicity of spleen cells from either the high responder C3H/HeN mice or the moderate responder C57BL/6N mice against either tumor target. The level of 18:2(n-6) in NK cell-enriched splenic lymphocytes increased with greater levels of dietary safflower oil. Nevertheless, there appeared to be no correlation between lymphocyte fatty acid composition and NK cell cytotoxic capabilities. Therefore, the concentration of dietary safflower or palm oil, and thus 18:2 (n-6), did not appear to effect the number or activity of murine NK cells.\r"

Healthy boys and men (19-22 per group) from a low selenium area (Dechang County) and from an area where sodium selenite was added to salt (Mianning County) were studied. Keshan disease was endemic in Dechang but occurred rarely in Mianning. After an initial blood sampling, each subject received daily selenium supplements (100 micrograms selenium for boys and 200 micrograms for men) as sodium selenate for 14 d. Blood was sampled again at 7 and 14 d. Boys from Dechang had blood selenium levels similar to levels reported for patients with Keshan disease. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity in boys and men from Dechang was 33 and 43%, respectively, of values from the corresponding groups in Mianning. Comparison of plasma selenium concentrations in boys and men from Dechang gave values of 33 and 38%, respectively, of the corresponding groups in Mianning. Selenium status did not affect red blood cell superoxide dismutase or catalase activities. Plasma vitamin E concentration was below the normal range in all groups but was unaffected by selenium status. Measurements of plasma malondialdehyde revealed no difference between subjects from Dechang and subjects from Mianning. Selenium supplementation raised plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and plasma selenium concentration in all groups. Groups with higher plasma selenium concentration had relatively smaller increases in glutathione peroxidase activity than in selenium concentration. These results characterize the selenium deficiency in subjects at risk for developing Keshan disease. The results obtained with supplementation of selenium indicate the presence of additional plasma forms of selenium besides glutathione peroxidase.\r"

In contrast, juvenile rats (3.5 wk of age) did not consume more energy, gain more weight, or become fatter when fed the wet, high starch diet than when fed the same diet in dry form. Although rats of both age groups fed high fat diets consumed more energy than rats fed high starch diets, the effect of the high fat diets was much smaller in juvenile than in adult rats. The level of dietary protein (20 vs. 8%) in the diets did not interact with diet type, but juvenile rats fed low protein diets gained less weight than juvenile rats fed standard protein diets. Additional experiments showed that juvenile rats fed a 20% protein diet were capable of increasing fluid intake and energy intake when given sweetened water or insulin, respectively. Thus, low susceptibility to dietary hyperphagia in juvenile rats cannot be explained by assuming that juvenile rats already eat as much as they can. These data are consistent with the possibility that developmental changes in taste responsiveness may contribute to this effect of age.\r"

  ".W": "Ferrokinetic and hematologic studies were performed using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine if 12 wk of exercise training alters the delivery of iron to the red blood cell (RBC) mass, the severity of the anemia or the maximal exercise performance of moderately iron-deficient animals. Forty rats were assigned to either iron-deficient (ID) or control (CN) diets, and further subdivided into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) groups. Exercised groups were trained on a treadmill, at a 15% grade, 65% VO2max, for 90 min/d, 4 d/wk. After 12 wk of exercise training and dietary iron deficiency, the final body weight of IDEX rats was 90.5% that of IDSD rats. Fractional plasma iron clearance in IDEX rats was 86% of that in IDSD rats (3.32 vs. 2.85%/min). Exercise training failed to increase absolute VO2max (ml/min) or change hemoglobin concentration in iron-deficient rats. Resting oxygen consumption in IDEX rats was 116% that in IDSD rats (42.8 vs. 32.5 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). We conclude that exercise training and iron deficiency interact to alter iron physiology in exercised, iron-deficient animals. This interaction affects the kinetic behavior of plasma iron, growth and basal oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical predictors of five abnormalities on the serum electrolyte panel and two abnormalities on the blood cell profile, to study which data elements carried predictive information, and to measure the predictive accuracy and stability of the resulting predictive equations. DESIGN: Prospective data collection from a computerized medical database supplemented by data entered by physicians who ordered outpatient tests into microcomputers. Equations were derived during an eight-month period and later validated twice in the same setting. SETTING: Academic primary care practice affiliated with a county hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were mostly black women; physicians were full-time academic general internists and medical residents. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 6,570 electrolyte and blood cell profile panels ordered during the equation derivation period. The mean receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area for the seven equations was 0.849. For the 4,977 tests ordered during ten months of prospective validation, the mean ROC curve area was only 3% less. For three equations, ROC curve areas were lower for patients with unscheduled visits than for those with scheduled visits (p less than 0.05). Except for two equations involving abnormalities with very low prevalences, the equations were also well calibrated. Prior results for the abnormality being considered were the strongest predictors, followed by other laboratory results, diagnoses, and the physicians' estimate of the probability that the test would be abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data can accurately predict abnormal results of common outpatient laboratory tests. Computers can help find the necessary data and produce estimates of risk.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To teach internal medicine residents key principles of clinical epidemiology that are necessary to read critically the medical literature. DESIGN: Two-phase, non-randomized, controlled educational trial. SETTING: University-based training program for residents (PGY-l-PGY-3) in internal medicine. PARTICIPANTS: All 83 residents participated in the trial. Seventy residents completed a test in clinical epidemiology at the end of Phases I and II. INTERVENTIONS: Residents were assigned to one of eight ambulatory care clinics for half a day each week. A literature-based curriculum in critical appraisal was the subject of a weekly pre-clinic conference for four clinics (Group A). The other four clinics (Group B) had a weekly conference on topics in ambulatory care medicine. At the end of Phase I, both groups were given a test of basic knowledge of clinical epidemiology. The curriculum was then modified with the addition of written questions to emphasize important educational points and to stimulate resident participation. The modified curriculum became the subject of the pre-clinic conference for Group B, while Group A changed to topics in ambulatory medicine. At the end of Phase II both groups were again tested on basic knowledge of clinical epidemiology. RESULTS: Group B performed significantly better on the second test than on the first, 68.5% vs. 63.3% (p = 0.034), while Group A did not improve (64.5% vs. 65.9%). The differences in test scores for Test II minus Test I were +5.17% in Group B and -1.44% in Group A (p = 0.019). Twenty-one percent of Group B residents vs. 5% of Group A residents improved their scores by 18% or more. CONCLUSIONS: The residency period is a difficult but important time to teach critical appraisal skills. Educational gains may be small and need to be critically evaluated to stimulate the development of more effective educational programs.\r"

To determine how frequently physicians discuss this issue with their patients, the authors gathered information on all 611 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) or the cardiac care unit (CCU) at a tertiary care teaching hospital over a nine-month period. They found that the issue was discussed with only 10.8% of patients or their families on admission of the patients to these units. Such discussions occurred more frequently with older patients, those who were more severely ill or were estimated to have worse prognoses, those with poor intellectual function, and those admitted to the MICU rather than the CCU.\r"

This difficult readability level has not improved since the forms were last tested in 1982. The mean length of the forms was 84.6 lines. Also found was a 58% increase in the length of forms since 1982, a factor known to impair comprehension. These factors, poor readability and increasing length, may make many consent forms incomprehensible.

Four patients increased their maximum incisal opening by an average of 49.1%, and two patients showed decreases in opening. Overall clinical results were judged to be very good.

Traditional imaging techniques rely on biplanar radiographs which provide only two-dimensional data. The introduction of three-dimensional image display (3DIR) has provided a method of object analysis in three planes of space, obviating the need for mental reconstruction, and yielding more spatial information than was previously available. This study was undertaken to investigate the quantitative value of three-dimensional images compared with cephalometric techniques in assessing a craniofacial deformity. Metallic marker references were placed on a deformed skull. Measurements taken from cephalograms and three-dimensional images were compared with corresponding digitized and manual measurements taken from the skull. Three-dimensional image reformation provided a more accurate representation of the deformity than the cephalometric methods. Because all structural relationships are preserved in the CT data matrix, measurements are inherently accurate and reproducible. 3DIR offers dynamic advantages over cephalometric methods because data can be manipulated interactively. Further investigation is needed to study the importance of head position and to develop patient selection criteria, scan protocols, and surgical treatment planning algorithms.\r"

The results showed that the animals who underwent rigid fixation had the most stable results, followed by the myotomy and bite-opening appliance groups.

Problems found in these studies were grouped into three categories: subject and methods issues, environmental factors, and outcome measurement. The combined average intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) of all low birth weight groups was 97.77 (SD 6.19); for control subjects the mean IQ/DQ was 103.78 (SD 8.16). This difference was statistically significant but perhaps not clinically significant. No differences in mean IQ/DQ scores were found among the low birth weight, very low birth weight, and extremely low birth weight subgroups. Statistically significant differences among all groups and control subjects were found when categoric data were analyzed, as were differences among the three subgroups; however, the variety of outcome criteria makes interpretation of the categoric analyses difficult.\r"

Persons reporting neurologic events were 6.4 times more likely to report a prior personal history of convulsions than those reporting nonneurologic events (95% confidence interval 4.7 to 8.8), and were 2.4 times more likely to report a history of convulsions in first-degree family members, that is, siblings or parents (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 3.4). Similar risks were noted for subgroup analyses controlling for type of event (febrile vs nonfebrile convulsion), age at immunization, source of report, number of previous doses of DTP vaccine, and day of onset. Because the Centers for Disease Control monitoring system receives reports on a nonrandom sample of all adverse events after immunization, selection bias could not be ruled out. On the basis of these data, we conclude that children with a family history of seizures are at increased risk of neurologic events, primarily febrile convulsions, after DTP vaccination. However, this increase in risk may reflect a nonspecific familial tendency for convulsions rather than a specific vaccine effect. Considering the rare occurrence of neurologic events after DTP vaccination, the generally benign outcome of febrile convulsions (which make up the majority of these neurologic events), and the possible increased risk of pertussis in the general population if the estimated 5% to 7% of persons with a first-degree family history of convulsions were exempted from pertussis vaccination, we further conclude that a history of convulsions in siblings or parents should not be a contraindication to pertussis vaccination. Special care in the prevention of postvaccination fever may be warranted in children with a family history of seizures.\r"

The majority of children had minimal long-term problems, and 60% of the children had only a single convulsion. In six of the patients, convulsions were a manifestation of more serious underlying conditions that produced significant morbidity. Seizures of differing clinical type occurred, with hypertension being the most significant etiologic factor. In children with renal failure, there are minimal symptoms heralding the hypertensive encephalopathy. Rapid resolution without recurrence of seizures after control of hypertension is a major sign that hypertension was the cause and that the long-term prognosis is good.\r"

Spontaneous GH secretion had wide variations, with values ranging from less than 1.0 to 67.0 micrograms/L. In prepubertal children the highest GH levels were usually noted during sleep; in pubertal subjects the highest values were distributed almost equally between sleep and wake hours. In all subjects, GH secretion appeared to decrease before meals, followed by an increase after meals. Most indexes of GH secretion and insulin-like growth factor I levels were significantly greater in pubertal than in prepubertal subjects (p less than 0.002), and in both groups the GH concentration was significantly greater during sleep (p less than 0.005). In all groups the 24-hour GH concentration correlated significantly with the area under the GH curve, 24-hour GH pulse amplitude, and GH concentration and peak GH level during sleep and wake hours (P less than 0.0001); 24-hour GH concentrations correlated with insulin-like growth factor I levels only when the entire group of 46 subjects was considered (p less than 0.01). There were no significant correlations between 24-hour GH concentration and the subjects' age, bone age, height (SD score), weight (SD score), or body mass index. We conclude that in subjects with normal stature, mean 24-hour GH concentrations vary considerably and in the low range overlap with values reported in hypopituitarism.\r"

During a 3-year period, we examined 37 infants and children (not premature neonates) with PDA as their only significant cardiovascular defect. Seventy-eight percent of these patients were considered potential candidates for the use of the PDA occlusion device, and it was successfully placed in all but 2 of 27 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization (PDA too small in one and too large in one). Only one of the remaining 25 patients had a significant residual shunt after placement of the device, which therefore was removed in the catheterization laboratory before surgical ligation of the PDA. There was no clinical evidence of a residual PDA in any patient. The duration of hospitalization was less than 24 hours for each of the last 20 procedures. Echocardiography demonstrated return to normal chamber dimensions in all patients, but a tiny, clinically undetectable residual leak around the device was found in three patients by Doppler evaluation. The transcatheter procedure was preferred over surgery by more than 90% of families and can be completed with a much shorter hospitalization than surgical ligation. We conclude that transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus is feasible in the majority of children with PDA.\r"

Commercially available equipment, specifically designed for this purpose, was employed. Forty paired thermodilution and pulsed Doppler determinations were made. There was a significant correlation between the two measurements (pulsed Doppler = 0.84 thermodilution + 0.39; r = 0.79, p less than 0.01). The ranges of thermodilution measurements (1.02 to 6.26 L/min; median 2.77 L/min) and pulsed Doppler measurements (1.13 to 6.35 L/min; median 2.57 L/min) were not different (p = 0.25). However, differences between individual paired thermodilution and pulsed Doppler measurements were large (-3.13 to 2.03 L/min; median 0.12 L/min), and the percentage difference between individual paired thermodilution and pulsed Doppler measurements ranged from 0.41% to 102.5% (median 12.7%). A discrepancy of 15% or more between thermodilution and pulsed Doppler was encountered in 18 (45%) of 40 of paired measurements (95% confidence interval: 29% to 61%), and one fourth of the paired measurements differed by more than 25%. We conclude that, as employed in this study, pulsed Doppler cardiac output determination is not sufficiently representative of the thermodilution output to be employed for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill children.\r"

Diagnostic procedures during bronchoscopy included 40 brushings, 50 bronchoalveolar lavages, and 6 transbronchial and mucosal biopsies. A total of 16 specific diagnoses were made by bronchoscopy (27% diagnostic yield), including infection (12), pulmonary leukemia (3), and lymphoma (1). The largest proportion of specific diagnoses came from lavage (14/50) and the smallest from brushings (1/40). Biopsies were also useful for selected patients. The low overall yield for bronchoscopy was probably due to the routine use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy, as well as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis. Subsequent specific diagnoses were obtained by other procedures (open biopsy, needle aspiration, or autopsy) for 10 patients with negative bronchoscopy results and 3 patients with diagnostic bronchoscopies. These additional diagnoses included 7 infections (Pneumocystis carinii (1), Candida tropicalis (1), cytomegalovirus (1), and Aspergillus (4), and 6 other diagnoses with nonspecific histologic findings. A positive bronchoscopy result may be useful, but negative bronchoscopy findings do not justify delaying other diagnostic procedures or discontinuing antibiotic and antifungal therapy in children with cancer and pulmonary infiltrates.\r"

Splenic function was assessed by radionuclide scan and pocked erythrocyte count. Patients were 6 to 18 years of age and had been receiving transfusions for 7 months to 10 years (median 4.2 years). Of the 12 children, five had normal or increased splenic size and function (normal scan and normal or minimally elevated pocked erythrocyte count). All were receiving intensive transfusion therapy, with the aim of maintaining the hemoglobin S level at less than 20%. The other seven patients had abnormal splenic function (absent radionuclide uptake and elevated pocked erythrocyte count); each was receiving less intensive transfusion therapy, with the pretransfusion hemoglobin S level usually at 30% to 40%. No patient developed bacterial septicemia while receiving hypertransfusion therapy. We conclude that splenic function during a long-term transfusion program is variable, depending in part on the \"intensity\" of transfusion therapy. Apparent splenic involution and fibrosis may be a reversible event in some patients.\r"

Neurologic findings were normal in 7 of the 11 children. The craniocervical junction and medulla were studied by magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed anatomy consistent with Chiari type I malformation in all cases. At surgery, all patients had tonsillar herniation to the first cervical vertebra or below. Three patients had syringomyelia. Postoperatively, either the patients were symptom free or, in the cases of scoliosis and torticollis, there was no progression. Our experience suggests that Chiari type I malformation may occur in childhood with varied and unusual clinical findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was essential to the diagnosis; the presence of tonsillar herniation was confirmed at surgery. The results of suboccipital decompression were favorable in this series.\r"

During fasting, the excretion of free carnitine and of acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, and hexanoylcarnitine was increased. The fractional tubular reabsorption of free carnitine was decreased, suggesting a renal leak of free carnitine. In the symptom-free, fed state, only minor amounts of free carnitine and of short-chain acylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, and hexanoylcarnitine were present in urine, and carnitine loss occurred in the form of \"other\" carnitine esters not exceeding that of control subjects. During L-carnitine therapy, the excretion of free carnitine, short-chain acylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, and hexanoylcarnitine, and particularly of \"other\" carnitine esters, was increased, suggesting a possible detoxifying effect of administered carnitine that is not confined to the elimination of octanoic and hexanoic acids. The employed method detects very low urinary concentrations of octanoylcarnitine and hexanoylcarnitine (less than 1 mumol/L) characteristic of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency and may be useful in screening for this disease, which has been associated with sudden infant death.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the presence and extent of thrombus formation in the apparatus used for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation we studied various portions of the polyvinylchloride circuit from five infants who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 70 to 330 hours. All infants had right-sided cannulation. Sections were cut from the circuit at the time of decannulation and subjected to light and scanning electron microscopy. The site that contained the most thrombus formation was the membrane oxygenator bypass circuit, which is subjected to repeated periods of unclamping and clamping to direct blood flow through the membrane oxygenator. Autopsy results from nonsurvivors showed evidence of pulmonary and renal infarcts, a left frontal lobe infarct, a thromboembolus of the left external and internal carotid arteries, and thrombi in the lungs, kidney, brain, and coronary arteries. One survivor had computed tomographic evidence of infarction of the left middle cerebral artery distribution. We suggest that the areas of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit subjected to repeated changes in flow dynamics may be the source of microemboli.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the cause of hemolysis during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) by monitoring hematologic and coagulation profiles in seven consecutive infants treated with this procedure. A constrained vortex pump was used in all patients, and the average duration of ECMO was 224 +/- 111 (SD) hours. In all patients, plasma free hemoglobin was low during the first 48 hours after the initiation of ECMO. Later, when visible clots appeared in the ECMO circuit, plasma hemoglobin progressively rose. A rise in the level of fibrin degradation products and a fall in the fibrinogen level were observed concurrently with a rise in the plasma hemoglobin level. After complete circuit changes in six patients, plasma free hemoglobin, fibrin split products, and fibrinogen all returned to baseline values. Neither circuit component changes nor exchange transfusion was effective in normalizing the levels of plasma free hemoglobin, fibrin split products, and fibrinogen. We conclude that when ECMO is administered for prolonged periods, circuit thrombosis occurs and hemolysis ensues. Additional studies are needed to assess the contribution of the constrained vortex pump to this process.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a double-blind, randomized study to test the hypothesis that a whey-dominant formula permits a growth and metabolic advantage over a casein-dominant formula in preterm infants after hospital discharge. Nineteen low birth weight infants were studied for 6 months from the time of discharge. Ten received a casein-dominant formula, and nine received a whey-dominant formula. Growth (weight, length, head circumference, mid-arm circumference, and skin-fold thickness), biochemical measurements (alkaline phosphatase activity, acid-base status, and hemoglobin, serum total protein, albumin, and urea nitrogen levels), and quantity of formula intake did not differ significantly between the groups over a 6-month study period. Serum transthyretin and urea nitrogen concentrations differed significantly between the two feeding groups at the day of entry into the study only. The results indicate that, after hospital discharge, premature infants fed a whey-dominant formula do not differ in growth or biochemical measurements from those fed a casein-dominant formula.\r"
