  ".U": "90200919\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported a cooperative effect between insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] in murine clonal osteoblastic cells, MCT3T3-E1. In the present study, the possible mechanism of interaction between these hormones was investigated. The effect of IGF-I on 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in MC3T3-E1 cells was examined. The affinity and hormone binding capacity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors were not altered by IGF-I. Immunoblot analysis showed about 54 kilodaltons (kDa) 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors, similar to that observed for mouse fibroblasts. The synthesis of IGF-I by the cells under a serum-free condition was determined by RIA. The assay revealed immunoreactive IGF-I secreted by MC3T3-E1 cells (1.79 +/- 0.04 x 10(-9) M, mean +/- SE, n = 5). Rat GH significantly increased the concentration of IGF-I, but 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not. IGF-I radioligand-receptor assay revealed specific binding of IGF-I to MC3T3-E1 cells. The relative potency of IGF-I-related peptides to bind with the cells was in the order of IGF-I much greater than multiplication-stimulating activity (the rat homologue of IGF-II) greater than insulin, and the receptor protein migrated as a 130-kDa band in autoradiography. Scatchard analysis showed a significant increase in IGF-I binding sites by 50% after 3-day treatment with 5 x 10(-11) M 1,25-(OH)2D3, without any change in affinity. These results indicate that the interaction of IGF-I and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the culture of MC3T3-E1 cells may be mediated by the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on IGF-I receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have presented evidence suggesting that there are distinct oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) receptors in the human and rabbit myometrium. In this study we have investigated whether OT and arginine vasopressin (AVP) activate the same or two different receptor systems in the rat uterus in producing their uterotonic action and whether the myometrial OT/VP receptors are similar to the V1 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells. We compared the dose-response characteristics of OT and AVP by the in vitro cumulative dose-response curve technique. We determined the ligand-receptor binding characteristics of [3H]OT and [3H]AVP on uterine membrane fractions from nonpregnant and pregnant rats. Specific OT antagonists were used in competition receptor binding assays and in antioxytocic pA2 bioassays against OT and AVP to determine whether OT antagonists can discriminate between OT- and AVP-binding sites in the myometrium. We also compared the in vitro antioxytocic (OT receptor-mediated action) and the in vivo antivasopressor (V1 receptor-mediated action) potencies of a series of six OT antagonists. Our results show that OT- and AVP-binding sites in the nonpregnant rat uterus have similar binding characteristics and cannot be distinguished by the dose-response study, radioligand receptor binding assays, or OT antagonists in the competition binding and pA2 assays. However, in the term pregnant parturient uterus, the two binding sites can be clearly differentiated. OT receptor density, but not AVP, was markedly increased at term pregnancy. All six OT antagonists studied in this investigation were more potent in antagonizing the uterotonic response to OT than the vasopressor response to AVP. The antioxytocic:antivasopressor potency ratios, however, were different between the antagonists, ranging from nearly equal (0.91) to low (0.1). The results above suggest that there are distinct OT- and AVP-binding sites in the rat myometrium. The myometrial OT/AVP receptors are similar to but not the same as the V1 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Uterine epithelial cells (UEC) isolated from mature mice as well as immature mice and rats were cultured on EHS matrix-coated nitrocellulose filters in order to determine their ability to secrete prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha and PGE2 in a polarized manner. Ultrastructural analyses were performed to validate the polar nature of mouse UEC and demonstrate the presence of separate apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains. These properties included the presence of tightly juxtaposed lateral membranes, apical microvilli, and a relatively flat basal surface. Biochemical indices of polarity included the preferential (approximately 5:1) basal uptake of [35S]methionine as well as a preferential (approximately 9:1) apical secretion of protein. UEC isolated from mice during the estrous and diestrous stages of the estrous cycle did not differ in their degree of polarity, as measured by these morphological and biochemical indices. UEC of estrous and diestrous mice as well as immature mice and rats preferentially secreted PGF2 alpha to the basal medium to an approximately 4-fold greater extent than to the apical medium. PGE2 was secreted at least 10-fold less than PGF2 alpha, and a preferential basal secretion could not be demonstrated. Polarized UEC accumulated relatively large cellular pools of PGF2 alpha, while nonpolarized cells grown on matrix-coated plastic did not. This difference was reflected by the inability of an inhibitor of PG biosynthesis, indomethacin, to inhibit PGF2 alpha secretion by polarized cells during short (4-h) incubations. In contrast, this drug effectively inhibited secretion in nonpolarized cells or polarized cells incubated with indomethacin for longer (24-h) intervals. Therefore, cellular PGF2 alpha pools apparently support continued secretion of this lipid even when de novo synthesis is transiently inhibited. Preferential basal secretion of PGF2 alpha was due to the polar nature of UEC, since disruption of tight junctions with EGTA modified the basal to apical ratio of PGF2 alpha secretion to near unity. Sodium azide inhibited the secretion of PGF2 alpha, indicating that PGF2 alpha secretion was energy dependent. PGF2 alpha secretion was not coupled to protein synthesis or secretion, since cycloheximide did not inhibit this process in polarized or nonpolarized cells. These studies describe the first evidence for polarized secretion of lipid-derived hormones by epithelial cells. The preferential basal secretion of PGF2 alpha may play an important role in regulating UEC interactions with the underlying stroma.\r"

Treatment of ovariectomized rats with ethinyl estradiol provoked a dose-dependent decrease in liver apo A-IV mRNA levels, whereas intestinal apo A-IV mRNA did not change. The serum apo A-IV concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of L-T4 increased liver apo A-IV mRNA levels more than 2-fold, while n-propylthiouracil (PTU) decreased these levels more than 4-fold. Intestinal apo A-IV mRNA levels remained constant upon L-T4 treatment, but increased after PTU. Change in thyroid hormone levels caused no significant alteration of plasma apo A-IV levels. Hydrocorticsone increased liver and intestinal apo A-IV mRNA levels 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, without changing plasma apo A-IV. Liver and intestinal apo A-IV mRNA underwent opposite changes during development. Intestinal apo A-IV mRNA decreased gradually during the period of weaning, while liver apo A-IV mRNA was undetectable before day 20 of life and rose to adult levels thereafter. Both L-T4 and hydrocortisone were able to increase liver apo A-IV mRNA prematurely when rat pups were treated from day 9 on. Hypothyroidism induced by PTU, on the other hand, was able to delay the developmental rise in liver apo A-IV mRNA. The hypolipidemic drug clofibrate reduced liver apo A-IV mRNA more than 10-fold without changing the intestinal levels. Plasma apo A-IV decreased by one third. Ethinyl estradiol, thyroid hormones, and clofibrate regulate apo A-IV mRNA abundance in a tissue-specific manner. Only liver, not intestinal, apo A-IV mRNA levels respond to treatment. Furthermore, opposing changes in liver and intestinal apo A-IV mRNA levels occur during development, and thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids are able to accelerate the developmental changes in liver apo A-IV mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "90200932\r", 
  ".W": "An integral part of the mechanism of estrogen action is the interaction of estrogen receptor (ER) complexes with specific nuclear acceptor sites to effect alterations in genomic expression. The localization of nuclear acceptor sites has been in question, but an increasing body of indirect evidence implicates the nuclear matrix. To assess the binding characteristics of [3H]estradiol-receptor complexes (3HER) to nuclear matrix, ER from ovariectomized mice was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and incubated under cell-free conditions with mouse uterine nuclear matrix at 4 C. The binding capacity of the nuclear matrix was determined to be 36.4 +/- 5.7 fmol/100 micrograms DNA, with a Kd of 0.23 +/- 0.03 nM. Binding to nuclear matrix sites was specific, as determined by the ability of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ER complexes to inhibit binding of 3HER. Spleen, used as a nontarget tissue, contained fewer binding sites (n = 4.07 fmol/100 micrograms DNA) than matrix from liver (n = 14.2). The binding affinity was the same in all three tissues. Injection of animals with estradiol before death was associated with loss of assayable nuclear matrix binding sites, implying occupancy of sites by ER in vivo. Unbound receptor (R) also demonstrated the ability to bind to uterine matrix (n = 40.2 +/- 2.7 fmol/100 micrograms DNA; Kd = 0.26 +/- 0.05 nM) as well as to competitively inhibit the binding of 3HER complexes. However, heat-inactivated receptor displayed no binding or competing activity, nor did the progesterone receptor. The two forms of the receptor can be functionally distinguished by extraction with 0.6 M KCl; 43% of ER, but no R, were resistant to KCl extraction. These results indicate that nuclear acceptor sites are associated with the nuclear matrix. Furthermore, these sites demonstrate the criteria expected of specific binding sites, i.e. high affinity, limited capacity, hormone receptor, and relative tissue specificity. The apparent association of uncomplexed receptor to nuclear acceptor sites may explain the uterine tissue nuclear localization of ER in the absence of hormone.\r"

Daily exposure to 150-min periods of immobilization resulted in a maintained increase in baseline plasma concentrations of native Met-enkephalin 21.5 h after the sixth day and a further increase after 39 days. The plasma native Met-enkephalin response to acute immobilization was attenuated on day 7 and completely absent on day 40. Unstressed rats showed a plasma native Met-enkephalin response to hemorrhage of 15% blood volume and a further increase in response to 25% hemorrhage. Immediately after initial acute immobilization or 6 days of daily immobilization when plasma native Met-enkephalin was elevated but the response to acute immobilization was attenuated, plasma native Met-enkephalin responses to hemorrhage were also attenuated. Rats that had been immobilized daily for 40 days and showed no plasma native Met-enkephalin response to acute immobilization also showed no responses to hemorrhage. After 39 days of immobilization when there was no plasma native Met-enkephalin response to acute immobilization, there was also no response to footshock. Thus, development of tolerance or adaptive loss of plasma native Met-enkephalin response to immobilization with repeated exposure to this stressor is associated with cross-tolerance or adaptive loss of the responses to the stresses of hemorrhage or electric footshock. Development of tolerance and cross-tolerance of plasma responses of peptidase-derivable Met-enkephalin paralleled that of native Met-enkephalin. Thus, adaptation of plasma Met-enkephalin responses to repeated exposure to a stressor included both increased resting secretion and decreased acute responses to homotypic or novel stressors.\r"

  ".W": "We have used immunohistochemistry to localize GH receptor/binding protein (BP) in the male and female reproductive systems of adult rats. Testes and ovaries from neonatal animals were also examined to determine if GH receptor/BP expression in these tissues is developmentally regulated. Two monoclonal antibodies (MAb 43 and 263) were immunoreactive in identical locations whereas no immunoreactivity was evident when control monoclonal antibodies 7 and 50.8 were used. Localization of the receptor/BP was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of immunopositive cells confirming our recent report of a nuclear GH receptor. Intense GH receptor/BP immunoreactivity in the male reproductive system was evident in the epithelium of the vas deferens and coagulating gland, the prostatic epithelium during the secretory phase, and the ductular epithelium of the coagulating and bulbourethral glands, respectively. Strong immunoreactivity was detectable in the Leydig and Sertoli cells, the epithelium of the ductus epididymis and seminal vesicles and smooth muscle of the tunica muscularis of the vas deferens, septae of the seminal vesicles, and in prostatic fibromuscular stroma. Cells of the seminiferous tubules (spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids) were moderately immunoreactive. No immunoreactivity was detectable in spermatozoa in the ductus epididymis or vas deferens, in scattered epithelial cells of the ductus epididymis, the prostatic epithelium in the nonsecretory phase, and mucous secreting cells of the bulbourethral glands. Leydig cells of 10-day postnatal rat testis were intensely immunoreactive whereas seminiferous tubular cells displayed homogenous immunoreactivity from moderate to strong. Intense GH receptor/BP immunoreactivity in the female reproductive system was evident in the germinal epithelium, the vascular endothelium of the myometrium, the epithelial lining of the fimbriae and oviduct, the endometrial epithelium and scattered endometrial glands, the mesothelium of the perimetrium, and the vascular endothelium of the endometrium. Strong immunoreactivity was exhibited by scattered oocytes, lutein cells of the corpus luteum, scattered endometrial glands, and the vascular endothelium of the endometrium. Moderate immunoreactivity was evident in scattered oocytes, granulosa cells, theca interna and externa, smooth muscle of the oviduct and myometrium, scattered endometrial glands, and luminally placed endometrial stroma cells. Ovarian granulosa cells from 10-day postnatal rats displayed strong immunoreactivity in contrast to moderate immunoreactivity in adult granulosa cells. In conclusion, we report a widespread distribution of the GH receptor/BP in the reproductive system of the rat by which GH may exert a direct action on reproductive function. The distribution is concordant with a role for GH in epithelial function and/or maintenance and also with a possible role for GH in the integrity of the endometrial vasculature.\r"

Bovine activin-A was found to inhibit the production of oxytocin (OT) and progesterone by bovine granulosa cells from individual preovulatory follicles cultured in serum-free medium. The minimal response on OT production (25% inhibition) occurred with 0.1-1 ng/ml activin-A, and the maximal inhibition (83%) occurred with 10 ng/ml activin-A after 2-3 days in culture. Progesterone showed a similar response (30% inhibition for 0.1-1 ng/ml and 74% for 10 ng/ml). Inhibin production was not consistently effected by activin-A. Inhibin (75 U/ml) had no detectable effect upon OT or progesterone production. When activin-A was withdrawn from the cell culture after 72 h and the incubation continued for a further 72 h, a recovery in OT was seen on day 4 and 5 after activin-A doses of 0.1-1 ng/ml, but not after higher doses (3 and 10 ng/ml). Progesterone did not show a recovery, but the levels remained constant for 3 days (0.1 and 0.3 ng/ml activin-A) or for 1 day (1-10 ng/ml activin-A) and then fell to control levels by day 6 of culture. We conclude that bovine activin-A has an autocrine action on bovine granulosa cells in vitro, to inhibit basal production of OT and progesterone, consistent with the role of activin-A in delaying the process of luteinization.\r"

Rat BNP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) was detected in the highest amount in cardiac extracts (574.0 +/- 138.8 pmol/g in the atrium and 4.3 +/- 1.1 pmol/g in the ventricle). The secretory rate of rat BNP-LI from the perfused whole heart was 50.0 +/- 1.9 fmol/min, about 60% of which was maintained even after atrial removal. We also detected rat BNP-LI throughout the spinal cord (134-175 fmol/g), although no detectable amount was present (less than 100 fmol/g) in other tissues including the brain. High performance-gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with the RIA revealed that rat BNP with 45 amino acids is a major storage form as well as a secretory form of rat BNP-LI in the heart. The major component in the spinal cord was also rat BNP. These findings indicate that the tissue distribution and the processing pattern of rat BNP are different from those of atrial natriuretic peptide and porcine BNP, thereby suggesting the presence of complicated diversity of the natriuretic peptide system.\r"

Under all circumstances tested, the AHP remained hyperpolarizing and was associated with a conductance increase. Thus, the very liable hyperpolarizing event that follows a depolarizing shift in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in various epileptic foci (which disappears early during the transition between interictal and ictal activity) probably is not due to the same mechanism as that which underlies the AHP.\r"

After the completion of AM kindling and repetitive induction of kindled convulsion, the percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) significantly decreased, while the total sleep time (TST) remained unchanged. REMS suppression was most profound during the immediate postictal hours and continued through the 22-h period without a rebound increase. Slow wave sleep (SWS) was also suppressed during the postictal hours; however, this suppression was exceeded by that of REMS and was followed by a rebound increase. These changes in sleep organization were transient. During a rest interval of 2 months without kindled convulsions, they gradually disappeared and there was a complete recovery to the prekindling baseline. However, when the AM-kindled convulsion was reintroduced, there was an abrupt REMS suppression without TST change. We conclude that changes in sleep organization after AM kindling are (a) characterized by suppression of REMS and a compensatory increase in SWS, and (b) a direct but transient correlate of convulsion rather than of an acquired seizure susceptibility.\r"

In the present work, we studied the effects of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of ZnCl2 on seizures induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) kainic acid (10 mg/kg) in rats and by noise (80-120 dB) in the DBA/2J mouse. Previous administration of zinc salt (20-200 mg/kg) substantially reduced the frequency of noise-induced running fits, clonic and tonic seizures, and deaths in mice, but had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of kainic acid-induced seizures in rats. Together with findings in the literature, our results suggest that zinc plays multiple, sometimes antagonistic roles in seizure development.\r"

In none of the patients with left dominance by Wada testing were language areas found with right-sided stimulation, but two patients with right dominance by Wada testing had language areas mapped on the left side. These findings suggest that left dominance by Wada testing is strong evidence for exclusive lateralization of language function in the left hemisphere, but there is concern about the ability of the Wada test to exclude the possibility of some left-sided language function despite apparent right-sided dominance. Patients with left dominance on Wada testing do not need cortical stimulation before extensive right temporal lobectomy, but we believe that patients with right or bilateral dominance on Wada testing should have cortical stimulation for localization of language areas if extensive left or right temporal or frontal resection is planned.\r"

Cross-correlation histograms were used to test for neuronal discharge timing relationships with inspiration or ECG. Linear regression was used to test for correlations of inspiratory time, respiratory period, and heart rate (HR) with tonic unit rate for each breath. Of 129 cells from 16 patients who later had resection, 89 were contralateral and 40 were ipsilateral to the resected lobe. Of the contralateral cells, 19% had a timing relationship with the cardiac cycle and only 1% had such a relationship with the respiratory cycle. Tonic correlations with HR were noted in 22% and with respiratory period and inspiratory time in 11 and 6%. Neither these percentages nor mean discharge rate differed between structures, although variance in rate was much higher on the resected side. Amygdala cells on the resected side showed more correlations with the cardiac cycle (55 vs. 20%), respiratory period (46 vs. 3%), and inspiratory time (27 vs. 7%) and were more likely to show several types of correlation. The results suggest a selective loss of ipsilateral amygdala cells and/or afferents, favoring relationships with cardiac- and respiratory-related systems and a possible synaptic reorganization of remaining cardiorespiratory afferents.\r"

In the present study, we quantified QUIN in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in spiking (focus) and nonspiking (nonfocus) regions of surgically resected human temporal neocortex. L-tryptophan (L-TRP), the putative precursor of QUIN, was also measured in brain, along with CSF concentrations of L-TRP, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and homovanillic acid (HVA). In brain tissue, no differences were found in the concentrations of QUIN and L-TRP between focus and nonfocus regions in 15 pairs of samples. No differences were found in CSF, L-TRP, 5-HIAA, or HVA concentrations between 11 neurologically normal controls and 15 interictal (no seizures for greater than 24 h) and 20 postictal (within 50 min of seizure) samples from epileptic patients. However, CSF QUIN concentrations were significantly lower (32%) in the epileptic patients as compared with controls, which may indicate a generalized disturbance in brain QUIN metabolism or perhaps a response to antiepileptic drugs.\r"

The relationship between the responses and the respondents' age, sex, marital status, number of offspring, level of education, occupation, and residence was analyzed. Education reduced the respondent's prejudice against play and employment, but did not change their objection to marriage and appeared to have reinforced their linking epilepsy with insanity. As compared with the surveys conducted in Western countries, our survey showed that awareness of epilepsy in China was greater, if not the same, but the attitudes toward epilepsy were much more negative.\r"

Acute coadministration of PB resulted in increased serum CBZ levels, whereas serum CBZ-E levels were initially lower and then higher. In daily urinary excretion, a reduction in both CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and CBZ-DIOL/CBZ ratio was observed. Chronic (30 day) coadministration of PB led to a decrease in serum CBZ levels after the first hour, whereas serum CBZ-E levels were initially higher and then lower. In daily urinary excretion, a decrease in CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and an increase in CBZ-DIOL/CBZ ratio were noted. These results are consistent with an inhibitory interaction and a metabolic induction on both CBZ epoxidation and CBZ-E metabolism in acute and chronic administration, respectively. However, effects on CBZ epoxidation were preferential. In the various brain areas, the effects observed were similar to those noted in serum. In addition, a relevant increase in brain/serum CBZ ratios was observed with chronic coadministration of PB.\r"

On the basis of the second-look laparoscopy, 13% of the women were offered tubal microsurgery and 14% recommended for IVF. Patients without risk factors for EP developed adhesions as frequently as those with known risk factors and no specific surgical procedure was correlated to impairment of the pelvic status. Almost 40% of the patients presented with an impairment of adhesions on the affected side compared with the status at the time of EP surgery. Lysis of adhesions was performed during the second-look laparoscopy in 42 patients (41%). We conclude that second-look laparoscopy should be recommended to all EP patients with a desire for pregnancy.\r"

We determined BBT shift using a microcomputer program, analyzed P levels by radioimmunoassay, and evaluated endometrial biopsies both prospectively (blinded) and retrospectively (with knowledge of the other variables). Serum P levels were within the normal range for the luteal phase and prospective and retrospective histological diagnoses closely agreed (82% within 2 days). The best correlation with the NMP was the BBT shift (r = 0.493) followed by P (r = 0.426) and prospective histologic dating (r = 0.390). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that use of all of the variables markedly improved the ability to estimate the POD (R2 = 0.51).\r"

Patients were selected for ambulatory laparoscopy or inpatient laparotomy by means of an algorithm based on their history and the selective use of HSG. Laparoscopy was avoided in 18.1% of patients and HSG in 41.6% of patients.

Cytosol P concentrations were highest in corpora lutea (mean +/- SEM, 3.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/g) during the midluteal phase (days 15 to 19) rather than the early (2.2 +/- 0.8 micrograms/g, days 20 to 25) and late luteal phases (1.8 +/- 0.8 micrograms/g, days 26 to 30). Cytosol 17-OHP concentrations also were 3.3 +/- 0.5, 4.3 +/- 0.6, and 3.3 +/- 1.0 micrograms/g in early, midluteal, and late luteal phases, respectively, and was significantly inversely correlated with occupied LH/hCG receptors in midluteal phase. Corpora albicantia had the lowest P (0.3 +/- 0.05 microgram/g) and 17-OHP (0.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/g) concentrations. Cytosol P and 17-OHP may therefore reflect the balance between the luteal cell production and secretion, whereas the amount of occupied and unoccupied LH/hCG receptors may partially explain the relationship between LH and P secretion.\r"

Some symptoms ordinarily indicative of psychopathology can represent normal side effects or reactions to infertility treatment, thus causing spurious estimates of pathology. Alternately, item analyses revealed a profile of infertility strain reflecting tension, depressive symptoms, worry, and interpersonal alienation frequently occurring among both male and female infertility patients. The concept of infertility strain is suggested as a vehicle for understanding the functioning of infertile patients and to circumvent the stigmatizing effects of psychiatric labels while providing appropriate intervention.\r"

Each participant provided an oocyte donor selected among fertile friends or family members. The retrieved oocytes were anonymously exchanged between phenotypically matched donor-recipient pairs. In the first 30 months of activity, we obtained 111 embryos suitable for transfer or cryopreservation from 52 retrievals, and 40 embryo transfers (ETs) were performed. Recipients received oral Estradiol-valerate and vaginal micronized progesterone. Fifteen embryos were transferred in 8 ETs conducted after donor-recipient synchronization. This resulted in four pregnancies, all ongoing (ongoing pregnancy rate 50% per transfer). Of the 96 cryopreserved embryos, 82 were thawed for ET, and 45 surviving embryos were transferred in 32 ETs. This resulted in eight pregnancies, with six ongoing or delivered (ongoing pregnancy rate 19% per transfer). The overall ongoing pregnancy rate of 25% per transfer indicates that our approach is a viable method for obtaining donated oocytes while respecting the ethical guidelines that recommended that donation of human gametes should be free, and from anonymous and fertile donors. Furthermore, guaranteeing anonymous oocyte donation had practical importance because, for many volunteer donors, it played a crucial role in their decision to donate.\r"

In the presence of certain associated pathological findings, however, the testes are significantly altered. Children with hydrocele and pathological findings are significantly older than hydrocele patients with no associated pathology. As a practical recommendation, hydrocele does not require immediate surgery. In the presence of hydrocele and certain associated pathology, however, surgery makes good sense.\r"

A significant function was identified using the following variables: sperm concentration and motility in semen, and mean curvilinear velocity, linearity, and amplitude of lateral head displacement of washed sperm. Movement measurements of capacitated spermatozoa were not useful predictors in this analysis. The overall accuracy of this function for predicting SPA results was 72%. These findings demonstrate that computer-derived measurements of sperm movement provide biologically useful information regarding sperm function, and, in addition, emphasize the importance of multivariate techniques in the analysis and description of human sperm motion.\r"

A wedge resection was completed on one ovary with a scalpel, and the ovarian cortex was reapproximated using microsurgical technique. In the contralateral ovary, a wedge resection was performed using the Nd:YAG laser and the cortex was left to heal by secondary intention. A second laparotomy was performed and the adhesion scores were compared between the two adnexa. In 17 of 19 rabbits, the adhesion score was greater on the side where ovarian reconstruction had been performed. No difference was noted in adhesion scores when, in our preliminary studies presented herein, laser and scalpel wedge resections were both followed by reapproximation of the cortex. These data have ramifications for conservative ovarian surgery performed both at laparotomy and laparoscopy.\r"

Prepubertal mice were begun on one of four blinded hormonal preparations consisting of two consecutive 3-day periods of daily injections: oil vehicle, oil-progesterone (P), estradiol (E2)-P, or CC-P. Blastocysts, which had not been exposed to CC, were then surgically transferred to these prepubertal recipients. Fourteen days after embryo transfer, implantations and term pregnancies were counted at necropsy. In this model, CC demonstrated no estrogen agonist effect, and had a significant adverse effect on endometrial receptivity. CC appeared to lower fecundity by a direct endometrial effect.\r"

  ".W": "Because the apparent reduction in cardiovascular risk noted in nondiabetic populations that ingest diets rich in marine lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids is believed to result in part from their capacity to modify the composition and physicochemical behavior of lipoproteins, we sought to determine whether dietary supplementation with marine lipids might favorably affect lipoprotein composition in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Eight normolipidemic IDDM women (mean +/- SD age 29.8 +/- 4.7 yr) were studied before and 3 mo after receiving a marine-lipid concentrate (Super-EPA) containing 6 g omega-3 fatty acids and a total of 12 mg of cholesterol daily. Weight, insulin requirements, and glycosylated hemoglobin remained stable. After treatment, mean +/- SD plasma triglyceride (TG) levels fell (before, 81.7 +/- 22 mg/dl; after, 69.19 +/- 17; P less than 0.025). High-density lipoprotein2 (HDL2) cholesterol (before, 10.98 +/- 5.45 mg/dl; after, 18.43 +/- 7.93; P less than 0.01), its major apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI), and the major phospholipids (sphingomyelin and lecithin) all rose significantly. ApoB and plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and HDL3 composition were unchanged. Postheparin hepatic and lipoprotein lipase activities were unaffected by marine lipids. These data indicate that women with IDDM experience apparently beneficial effects on TG and HDL2 from dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids administered in a low-cholesterol-containing oil without adversely affecting overall diabetes management. If these changes in lipoprotein concentration and composition prove to have antiatherogenic consequences and are free of long-term toxicity, these agents may have a role in the therapy of IDDM patients.\r"

In studies designed to see whether increased dietary carbohydrate, fat, or protein influenced the severity or age at onset of the syndrome, we fed semipurified AIN-76 diet adulterated with increased amounts of these ingredients. Surprisingly, all AIN-76-based diets greatly reduced the expected incidence of diabetes at 30 wk. In addition, a hypoallergenic infant formula, Pregestimil, containing casein hydrolysate in place of protein, completely prevented diabetes up to 1 yr of age. To assess how dietary components might modulate the diabetes incidence, we adulterated standard AIN-76 diet with skim milk, gluten, brewer's yeast, or a natural-ingredient rodent open-formula mouse diet (Old Guilford 96 [OG96]. No increase in diabetes incidence was seen with skim milk (10%) or wheat gluten (10%), whereas brewer's yeast (10%) and OG96 (25%) added to AIN-76 increased the incidence compared to mice fed OG96 only. The diabetogenic factor or factors in OG96 could be extracted by chloroform plus methanol (2:1), leaving little activity in the residue. We conclude that diet is a critical factor in diabetes development and that unknown chloroform-methanol-soluble substances in natural-ingredient chow not found in semipurified diets can enhance the development of diabetes in genetically susceptible mice.\r"

After 4 mo, glucose metabolism in the same three regions was decreased by 32, 43, and 60%. This reduction was paralleled by a statistically nonsignificant reduction in blood flow in neocortex and basal ganglia. It is suggested that the decrease of brain glucose metabolism in STZ-D reflects increased ketone body oxidation and reduction of electrochemical work.\r"

C4bBP was increased in diabetic patients and correlated with HbA1 levels.

Diabetes mellitus was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (body wt 243 +/- 11 g) with an injection of 25 mg/kg i.v. STZ. Membrane fluidity of PMNs was significantly lower at 2 wk after the STZ injection when serum glucose reached the plateau (31.1 +/- 5.8 mM), and after 3 wk, membrane fluidity remained unchanged. In 7 STZ-resistant rats for which serum glucose was less than 10 mM at 2 wk after the STZ injection, gradual normalization in membrane fluidity was observed. PMN membrane fluidity at each week correlated inversely with respective serum glucose levels 1 wk previously (r = -0.76) but not with serum lipid levels. Cross-incubation studies ascribed this observation to factors in the diabetic rat serum. Glycosylated protein, which was separated from diabetic rat serum, decreased membrane fluidity of control rat PMNs. Human diabetic subjects have an increased risk for infection, which may be due partly to altered membrane fluidity of their PMNs.\r"

  ".W": "Late morulae and blastocysts were recovered from streptozocin-induced diabetic pregnant rats and individually examined for numbers of inner cell mass (ICM) cells and trophectoderm (TE) cells. Compared with embryos collected from control rats, exposure to maternal diabetes significantly decreased mean ICM cell number of blastocysts recovered on day 5 of gestation, but the TE population of these embryos remained unaffected. The mean ICM proportion was therefore significantly lower than that of control embryos. These differences were not observed between the two groups of morulae collected on day 5, suggesting that the distinctive susceptibility of the ICM was expressed after blastocyst formation. On day 6, a significant inhibitory effect of diabetes was observed on the growth of both ICM and TE cells, but because the reduction was more severe in the ICM than in the TE, the mean ICM proportion of these blastocysts was again significantly lower than in control embryos. A linear quadratic relationship was obtained between the numbers of ICM cells of individual blastocysts and their respective numbers of TE cells in each of the two experimental groups. However, the slope of the curve was slower in the diabetic group than the control group. The disturbed ICM cell growth in the blastocysts from diabetic rats was found to be associated with a significantly increased incidence of cell death predominantly located in the ICM. Because it is known that excessive reduction of the ICM is incompatible with normal embryogenesis after implantation, our results suggest that the differential sensitivity of ICM and TE cells in preimplantation blastocysts may contribute to the pattern of postimplantation defects described in diabetic pregnancies.\r"

The opportunity was taken to assess by questionnaire the views of the participants on a range of issues related to health care in Nigeria and of the training and supervision of general medical practitioners. Sixty-six per cent of potential respondents provided completed questionnaires. A large proportion of respondents felt the need for some revisions in the curriculum and for a greater emphasis on small group training. The results indicated scepticism about the role of high technology medicine and private medical practice in meeting the health needs of Nigerians. There were some differences between the trainees and their supervisors and faculty board members in the responses obtained. The programme in Nigeria and the attitudes of those taking part demonstrate a vigorous and visionary approach to health care. It is hoped that this experience will be a useful and important example of what can be achieved in a country with potential for development.\r"

Patient-centred care was defined as care in which the doctor responded to the patient in such a way as to allow the patient to express all of his or her reasons for coming, including: symptoms, thoughts, feelings and expectations. The study took place in the offices of six family doctors. All consultations were audiotaped and the patients completed a questionnaire and two structured interviews with the investigator: one immediately following the consultation and the other two weeks later. Patient-centredness was found to be associated with the doctor having ascertained the patient's reasons for coming and with resolution of the patient's concerns. It was also associated with the patient feeling understood and resolution of the patient's symptoms until confounding variables were controlled. The results of the multivariate analysis suggested that the impact of a patient-centred approach may be part of a package of care, consisting of a doctor whose overall practice allows for the development of personal relationships with patients over time through continuity of care.\r"

Twenty-eight per cent of the general practitioners would never disclose information to others without the patient's consent, while 14% would disclose information to other physicians, members of non-medical professions and relatives. The largest proportion (38%) would disclose information only to other physicians. General practitioners were less likely to divulge information if they were: younger, female or practising in group practices. In particular, general practitioners who involved patients in decision making were less likely to disclose information to third parties. A plea is made for more education about confidentiality in the medical curriculum.\r"

Only 23 (15%) of the patients investigated were found to have no active pathology. Twenty-nine (14%) of the 212 study patients had received one or more gastrointestinal investigations in the 18 months subsequent to starting H2-antagonist therapy. Twenty-five of these patients had also received an investigation before starting therapy. One hundred and eleven patients (52%) had had their H2 antagonist therapy initiated by their general practitioner.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred patients from eight health centres were recruited for this two-year study on the possibility of replacing antihypertensive drugs by non-pharmacological therapy. This consisted of monthly check-ups and blood pressure measurements at home by the patients plus advice about changes of lifestyle--salt restriction, weight reduction, physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco. The non-pharmacological treatment was effective and 44% had discontinued drugs after two years without any increase in diastolic blood pressure. Twenty-five per cent reduced their weight by 4% or more. There were no changes in sodium or potassium output. Thirty-five per cent increased their physical activity and 20% decreased it. When the results for each health centre were compared, striking differences in hypertensive characteristics of patients and the outcome of antihypertensive drug treatment were found. In one health centre 69% of patients were not taking drugs after two years. In some health centres the non-pharmacological treatment was quite successful, but in others the attempt failed. A prerequisite for successful use of pharmacological treatment is that the problem of non-compliance should be solved.\r"

All had seen their general practitioner within the last five years, and half recalled having had a blood pressure check in the preceding 12 months. The 70 clients were given a copy of the result of the blood pressure check to return to their general practitioner. On checking the general practitioner record of 40 such patients, 25 (63%) had previous blood pressure recordings in the last five years. Only 10 (25%) contained the pharmacy reading, although the records of high readings were more likely to be present.

These results are not favourable to the idea of blood pressure screening by pharmacists, unless it is part of a major coordinated programme.\r"

The dietary prescription for treatment of hypertension usually involves modifications in energy, fat, and minerals. Weight, blood cholesterol, and triglycerides should be controlled through dietary management. Sodium's effect on blood pressure is controversial and not clearly defined; however, sodium restriction is usually prescribed for hypertensive patients because of potential benefits. Other minerals that may affect blood pressure include potassium and calcium. Good dietary intake of both minerals has been associated with lowered blood pressure. An accompanying scenario illustrates the effectiveness of dietary management.\r"

Six of the gall stone patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid three weeks before cholecystectomy. The number and the volume density of the mucin containing secretory granules, were not significantly increased in gall stone patients compared with gall stone free subjects. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid did not affect the number or volume density of the secretory granules. Thus, these results do not give evidence for that the degree of cholesterol saturation influences mucin content in the gall bladder wall of man. A major new finding was that gall stone patients had a markedly reduced total lysosome area and volume density of lysosomes compared with gall stone free subjects, a finding which may be related to a decreased intracellular degradation of protein and/or mucin.\r"

Muscle strips representing either the longitudinal or the circular layer were prepared and mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was recorded. Electrical field stimulation, selectively exciting nerves, was applied. Strips from the circular layer from controls relaxed during field stimulation, an effect that was the result of stimulation of noncholinergic, non-adrenergic, inhibitory nerves. Circular muscle strips from achalasia patients contracted during field stimulation, an effect that was caused by muscarinic receptor activation. In one patient, atropine reversed the contraction to a relaxation. Longitudinal muscle strips contracted in response to stimulation in both controls and achalasia patients. This response was abolished by atropine. In conclusion the function of postganglionic inhibitory nerve fibres to the circular layer of the oesophagogastric junction is severely impaired in achalasia, while there is a conspicuous, functional cholinergic innervation.\r"

  ".W": "Acid and alkali secretion have been examined together with prostaglandin E2 production in response to two mucosal protective drugs, colloidal bismuth subcitrate and sucralfate. Doses of colloidal bismuth subcitrate in the therapeutic range (120 and 1200 mg) had no effect on alkali secretion or luminal PGE2 output when perfused into the stomach of human volunteers. Similarly, in the anaesthetised rat, neither gastric acid nor duodenal alkali secretions were influenced by iv (12 mg/kg) or topical (120 mg/ml) administration of colloidal bismuth subcitrate. In contrast, perfusion of the human stomach with 1 g sucralfate stimulated bicarbonate output by 50%, a response which was unaffected by indomethacin (25 mg/h). A rise of 64% in gastric PGE2 output after sucralfate was, however, prevented by indomethacin pretreatment. Alkali secretion by rat duodenum was also increased by sucralfate but the response depended on the basal secretory rate. Low basal secretors (less than 3 mumol) showed a 75% stimulation whereas rats with high basal secretory rates (greater than 3 mumol) showed no significant response. All duodenal preparations regardless of basal secretory rate showed a stimulation of bicarbonate output with topical PGE2. The results suggest that enhancement of gastroduodenal bicarbonate secretion may play a role in the protective action of sucralfate but is unlikely to explain mucosal protection by colloidal bismuth subcitrate.\r"

Thirty eight per cent of these subjects had increased intraepithelial lymphocyte populations and a highly significant association with HLA-DR3 compared with controls. Their intestinal permeability to 51chromium-labelled ethylenediamine tetraacetate was invariably normal and there was no evidence of abnormal mucosal architecture, increased crypt cell mitotic activity or lymphocyte 'activation'. Although increased intraepithelial lymphocyte counts clearly do not cause alterations in intestinal structure or function, it is likely that this parameter together with the HLA-DR3 status identifies a genetically determined predisposition to the disease which may only become clinically evident with larger doses of ingested gluten.\r"

In eight healthy adults we studied the reproducibility of the technique and the accuracy with which 5 g and 20 g doses of lactulose could be calculated from the H2 excretion after their ingestion by means of a 10 g lactulose standard. The influence of different lengths of the test period, different definitions of the baseline and the significance of standard meals and peak H2 concentrations was also studied. Regardless of baseline definition, estimates of malabsorption were most precise, if areas under the H2 concentration v time curves for four hours or more from the start of the excess H2 excretion were used. The median deviations from the expected values were 20-30% (5-60%, interquartile range). This corresponded to the deviation in reproducibility of the standard dose. We suggest that individual estimates of carbohydrate malabsorption by means of H2 breath tests should be interpreted with caution if tests of reproducibility are not incorporated. Both areas under curves and peak H2 concentrations seem valid for comparison of groups.\r"

All subjects (non-smokers, asymptomatic cigarette smokers, and smokers with oesophagitis) were studied postprandially with a lower oesophageal sphincter sleeve assembly, distal oesophageal pH electrode, and submental electromyographic electrodes. The two groups of cigarette smokers then smoked three cigarettes in succession before being recorded for an additional hour. As a group, the cigarette smokers had significantly lower lower oesophageal sphincter pressure compared with non-smokers but the sphincter was not further compromised by acutely smoking cigarettes. Cigarette smoking did, however, acutely increase the rate at which acid reflux events occurred. The mechanisms of acid reflux during cigarette smoking were mainly dependent upon the coexistence of diminished lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Fewer than half of reflux events occurred by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations. The majority of acid reflux occurred with coughing or deep inspiration during which abrupt increases in intra-abdominal pressure overpowered a feeble sphincter. We conclude that cigarette smoking probably exacerbates reflux disease by directly provoking acid reflux and perhaps by a long lasting reduction of lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.\r"

  ".U": "90201783\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of progressive starvation for up to three days on the secretory functions of the intestine were investigated using in vitro and in vivo preparations of rat jejunum and secretagogues whose action was either through cyclic AMP or Ca++. Initial starvation for 24 h (day 1) did not significantly alter the basal net electrogenic ion secretion measured in vitro as the short circuit current (Isc, muamps/cm2) or the change in electrogenic ion secretion (delta Isc) induced by the secretagogues. By day 2 of starvation, however, the maximum delta Isc transient induced by the cholinergic and other secretagogues (delta Isc = Isc max-basal Isc) was greatly increased (up to a maximum of 117%) compared with the fed controls on an area basis. The delta Isc were even greater on day 3 of starvation. If a tissue weight basis was used to normalise the data the increase became even more marked. The enhancement in secretion was not caused by a decrease in absorptive capacity as glucose, added mucosally, gave larger increases in absorptive currents in the starved than in the fed jejuna. Bethanecol dose-delta Isc response curves in fed and starved jejuna showed an increase in the maximum electrogenic secretion in the starved but no apparent change in the affinity of their cholinergic receptors mediating the enhanced secretion. The starvation-induced increase in secretion elicited by bethanecol was blocked by atropine, indicating that the receptors were muscarinic, but was unaffected by tetrodotoxin indicating that the enteric neural innervation was not essential for its expression. Noradrenaline released by tyramine was greater in the starved than the fed jejunum, suggesting that a decreased sympathetic tone was unlikely to be the major cause of the starvation induced secretory enhancement. Measurement of jejunal fluid movements in vivo showed that in fed controls and throughout the three days of starvation there was an unchanged net fluid absorption in the basal, unstimulated state. By day 2 and day 3 of starvation, however, bethanecol stimulated fluid secretion was very much greater than that of the fed controls. This increase in fluid secretion was concomitant with significant increases in the concentration of chloride in the lumenal fluid. Starvation thus appears to make the rat jejunum hypersensitive to cholinergic and other secretagogues, increasing the electrogenic secretion of chloride in vitro and that of chloride and fluid in vivo. These results obtained with the rat model give a new insight into possible mechanisms by which the diarrhoea of human famine and malnutrition may be expressed.\r"

All patients with a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, defined by the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the gut (38), or a radiological diagnosis with peripheral eosinophilia (two), were identified from the Mayo Clinic records; in none was there evidence of extraintestinal disease. Patients were divided into three groups according to the Klein classification: predominant mucosal (23), muscular (12), or subserosal disease (five). A fourth group of patients (10) for comparison had abdominal symptoms and unexplained peripheral eosinophilia but no proven eosinophilic infiltration of the gut. It was found that a history of allergy was reported by 20 of 40 patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Peripheral eosinophilia was absent in nine of 40. The patients with subserosal disease were distinct from the other groups in presentation (abdominal bloating, ascites), higher eosinophil counts and in their dramatic responses to steroid therapy. Otherwise the patients were similar regarding demographic factors, presenting symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, diarrhoea), and laboratory parameters. The ESR was moderately raised in 10 of 40 patients. The disease may affect any area of the gastrointestinal tract; eosinophilic infiltration was documented in the oesophagus in one patient and in the colon in two cases. Endoscopic biopsies missed the diagnosis in five of 40 presumably because of patchy disease. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms even in the absence of peripheral eosinophilia.\r"

Adhesion and invasion of malignant cells may be modulated by their receptor mediated binding to the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. We studied the specific adhesion of human colon adenocarcinoma derived HT 29 cells to laminin and its proteolytic fragments. The major cell adhesion domain of laminin was localised in the central part of the cross shaped molecule. Immunoblotting experiments on separated HT 29 cell membranes using specific antibodies or radiolabelled laminin fragments revealed two major laminin-binding cell surface components with Mr of 67,000 and 69,000 D similar to the putative laminin receptor described for other tissues. Using a nitrocellulose filter disk assay, the specific interaction between cell surface binding proteins and proteolytic fragments originating from the central core of the laminin molecule could be further corroborated. In contrast, interaction of HT 29 cell membranes with the pentapeptide YIGSR (tyr-ile-gly-ser-arg), a sequence domain of the B1-chain of the laminin molecule, thought to be responsible for cell adhesion, was significantly weaker.\r"

  ".W": "Because unexplained 'functional symptoms' are a major cause of referral to gastroenterologists, the efficiency of the medical history to lead to a positive diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, without resorting to the use of expensive tests, remains a key question. Whilst the six criteria of Manning et al are widely used, data on their validity in discriminating irritable bowel syndrome from healthy controls, irritable bowel syndrome from non-ulcer dyspepsia and especially among irritable bowel syndrome subgroups, are not available. To evaluate this, we studied 361 outpatients who completed a bowel disease questionnaire, which objectively measured Manning's (and other) criteria. The group included 82 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 33 with non-ulcer dyspepsia, 101 with organic gastrointestinal disease, and 145 healthy controls. Diagnoses were based on a full and independent clinical evaluation, not on responses to the bowel disease questionnaire. Reliability was assessed by a test-retest procedure. All six of the individual Manning criteria were found to be reliable (median kappa = 0.79). Based on a logistic regression analysis of the discriminatory value of Manning's criteria, as the number of positive criteria increased, so did the predicted probability of irritable bowel syndrome. This predictive value was highest in younger patients and in females. The Manning criteria discriminated irritable bowel syndrome from organic gastrointestinal disease and from all non-irritable bowel syndrome gastrointestinal disease with a sensitivity of 58% and 42%, and a specificity of 74% and 85%, respectively. Stools that were often loose and watery provided an additional independent criterion for distinguishing irritable bowel syndrome from non-irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, symptoms can be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome positively, but Manning's criteria are not highly sensitive.\r"

Methods used included the assessment of fracture prevalence rates, spinal radiography, and measurements of bone mineral density in the spine and the forearm. Spinal and peripheral fractures were more prevalent in the patients than in the control subjects (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.01 respectively). The type of the underlying liver disease did not significantly affect the fracture prevalence rates, but alcoholic patients sustained more peripheral fractures than patients with other hepatic disorders (p less than 0.05). The bone mineral densities of the spines and the forearms were significantly reduced in male patients of all age groups and in female patients aged 60 years or more (p less than 0.001 for men and p less than 0.01 for women for both measurements). The prevalence rates of spinal and forearm osteoporosis were twice as high among patients with liver disease than in control subjects regardless of the definitions used. The presence of cirrhosis and hypogonadism were major risk factors for development of both spinal (Beta coef = 0.190 and 0.176; SE = 0.079 and 0.086 respectively) and forearm osteoporosis (Beta coef = 0.20 and 0.29; SE = 0.073 and 0.80 respectively).

Using a sensitive immunoblotting technique, low molecular weight IgM was detected in all 17 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and constituted up to 5% of the total circulating IgM. This low molecular weight IgM moiety correlated significantly with total IgM (p less than 0.01) but not with the specific biliary cirrhosis mitochondrial autoantibody anti-M2. Furthermore it was not possible to show that a partially purified sample of low molecular weight IgM contained M2 binding activity. Mitogen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two of four patients were observed to secrete low molecular weight IgM in vitro, a finding seen in only one of six healthy subjects. Immunoblot analysis of patients sera revealed the presence of other oligomers of IgM in addition to low molecular weight IgM. In conclusion this study suggests that during the enhanced IgM synthesis observed in primary biliary cirrhosis a defect occurs in the assembly of the IgM pentamer with release of monomeric and oligomeric IgM into the circulation. The pathogenic significance of these circulating low molecular weight IgM species is unknown.\r"

In the present study the effect of gastrin on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats was investigated. After partial hepatectomy a significant rise in the concentration of gastrin in portal venous blood was found six, 12, and 18 hours after 70% hepatectomy. The effect of changes in the endogenous gastrin concentration on the liver regeneration was investigated in rats subjected to antrectomy or to fundectomy. Partial hepatectomy was done three weeks after the primary surgery. We found antrectomy to decrease liver regeneration, whereas fundectomy had no effect. Administration of pentagastrin 300 micrograms/kg sc three times daily for two and four days after partial hepatectomy significantly increased the rate of liver regeneration compared with controls. This study suggests that gastrin has a hepatotrophic effect. Whether this effect is caused by a direct action of gastrin on the hepatocytes or it is an indirect effect mediated by for instance insulin, glucagon or epidermal growth factor has to be further investigated.\r"

They received either a low (25-50 mg) or high (50-100 mg) dose of hydrochlorothiazide daily. Of 644 patients who completed the hydrochlorothiazide titration, 375 (58.2%) were responders (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 and less than or equal to 5 mm Hg below baseline) and 92.8% of these completed a 6-month maintenance period. Blood pressure was reduced from 157.6/98.5 mm Hg by 18.3/9.5 mm Hg with low dose hydrochlorothiazide and by 20.4/9.6 mm Hg with high dose hydrochlorothiazide; more patients achieved goal blood pressure with the high dose. Whites and blacks responded equally. Serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/l occurred in 104 of 321 (32.3%) of the high dose versus 62 of 333 (18.6%) of the low dose hydrochlorothiazide patients. The 269 nonresponders to hydrochlorothiazide were randomly assigned in a double-blind study to receive hydralazine, methyldopa, metoprolol, or reserpine in addition to hydrochlorothiazide; 79.2% responded to the addition of the second drug and 87.3% of these completed a 6-month maintenance phase. Overall, there were no significant efficacy differences among the step 2 regimens. We conclude that the lower dose of hydrochlorothiazide was nearly as effective as the higher dose, and the addition of a second drug was effective and generally well tolerated in elderly patients.\r"

Men with mild-to-moderate diastolic hypertension who had passed their 60th birthday were entered into the trial. After a placebo washout period, they were assigned in a randomized, double-blind manner to one of two groups receiving hydrochlorothiazide (either 25 mg once or twice daily or 50 mg once or twice daily). Responders entered a 1-year maintenance period. Nonresponders were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with hydralazine, methyldopa, metoprolol, or reserpine added to the diuretic therapy. During the placebo and treatment periods, patients underwent a battery of psychometric tests designed to assess cognitive function, motor skills, memory, and affect. A separate questionnaire assessed the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. A subset of patients blindly being treated with placebo received the same battery of tests as a control for practice effect. The results showed that there was similar improvement on the psychometric tests between those patients whose blood pressure was successfully reduced and the placebo-treated control group. Therefore, the practice effect did not obscure a true deterioration in function. There were no substantive differences between the lower and higher doses of diuretic or among the four drugs added to the diuretic, although there were qualitative differences in side effects. We conclude that blood pressure reduction, per se, does not adversely affect cognitive and behavioral function in elderly hypertensive patients and that antihypertensive treatment is safe and effective in these patients.\r"

Adrenal responses to Ang II were assessed again during the non-steady state interval 24 and 48 hours later, and after balance was achieved in 5-7 days. Renin-angiotensin system activation was evident within 24 hours after sodium intake was restricted. The increase in basal plasma aldosterone concentration and enhancement of the adrenal response to Ang II, on the other hand, tended to lag. Within 24 hours of restricting sodium intake, despite a significant increase in both plasma renin activity (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.7 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.01) and Ang II concentration (22.0 +/- 1.9 vs. 29.5 +/- 1.3 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), there was no increase in basal plasma aldosterone concentration (10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 11.7 +/- 1.2 ng/dl).

In SHR and in some patients with essential hypertension particularly, the increased phospholipase C responsiveness of platelets has been described as involved in the hyperreactivity to thrombin. To determine the relation between such an enzymic abnormality and hypertension, the platelet phospholipase C activity was investigated in various models of experimental hypertension (i.e., in the Dahl salt-resistant and salt-sensitive strains inbred by John Rapp at Toledo, Ohio, SR/Jr and SS/Jr, respectively) fed either on a low or a high NaCl-containing diet, and in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. In phosphorus-32-prelabeled platelets, phospholipase C was determined by measurement of the thrombin-induced [32P]phosphatidic acid formation; the labeling of the P47 protein with 32P was also measured. In parallel experiments, the platelet reactivity was assessed by measurement of the thrombin-induced serotonin release. Under thrombin (0.05-0.5 units/ml) stimulation, phospholipase C activity, [32P]P47 labeling, and serotonin release were significantly increased in SS/Jr rats fed a high NaCl diet compared with SS/Jr rats fed a low NaCl diet. NaCl-rich diet did not modify phospholipase C in SR/Jr rats. Platelet reactivity and phospholipase C responsiveness were also normal in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular dysfunction associated with obesity was assessed by comparing rats that had been maintained on a regular or high fat diet since weaning. Rats on the high fat diet not only gained weight faster than age-matched controls but also had higher systolic and mean pressures. Development of mild hypertension in obese rats was first detected by indirect tail-cuff measurement and confirmed later by recording intra-arterial pressures directly from indwelling femoral catheters. To assess baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, reflex heart rate responses were elicited by lowering blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside or elevating it with phenylephrine. Initial tests showed that, although reflex tachycardia during depressor responses to sodium nitroprusside did not differ between groups, reflex bradycardia during pressor responses to phenylephrine was weaker in obese than in control rats. Underlying autonomic mechanisms were then examined by repetition of baroreceptor reflex tests after cholinergic blockade with methylatropine or beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Reflex tachycardia was equally inhibited in both groups by either antagonist. By contrast, reflex bradycardia was reduced more in obese than in control rats by beta-adrenergic blockade but was equally reduced by cholinergic blockade. Because residual responses after beta-adrenergic blockade would represent remaining parasympathetic mediation, these results indicate that reflex bradycardia was selectively impaired because of deficient parasympathetic mediation. Considered collectively, our results suggest that impaired parasympathetic mediation of reflex bradycardia could either result from or contribute to the blood pressure elevation in obese rats.\r"

Resting diameters were significantly smaller in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats at the first-order (-28%) and second-order arteriolar (-21%) levels. Precapillary third-order and fourth-order arterioles of spontaneously hypertensive rats had normal diameters, whereas postcapillary small venule diameters were slightly larger in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Thirty percent and 41% of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and Wistar-Kyoto rat third-order arteriolar vessels and 63 and 45% of the fourth-order arteriolar vessels exhibited vasomotion. Vasomotion amplitude, but not frequency, was significantly higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. It is concluded that, in the established phase of spontaneous hypertension in the rat, a decreased diameter of large arterioles is the major mechanism underlying the increased vascular resistance in cutaneous skeletal muscle.\r"

Intravital microscopy was used to study the spinotrapezius muscle arteriolar network in anesthetized salt-sensitive rats fed either a high salt (7% sodium chloride) or low-normal salt (0.45% sodium chloride) diet for 4 weeks. Age-matched Dahl salt-resistant rats on high and low-normal salt diets served as controls. The high salt diet had no effect on arterial pressure in salt-resistant rats but increased arterial pressure in salt-sensitive rats. Mean resting diameter of arcade arterioles in salt-sensitive rats on high salt diet was reduced by 25% compared with salt-sensitive rats on low salt or salt-resistant rats on either diet. After abolition of vascular tone with 10(-3) M adenosine, arcade diameters were comparable in all groups. No difference among groups was found in either resting or passive diameter of the more distal transverse arterioles. Measurement of vessel lengths and numbers in cleared muscle specimens revealed no differences among groups in the anatomic density of either arcade or transverse arterioles. These data suggest that a reduction in the resting diameter of arcade, but not transverse, arterioles may increase spinotrapezius muscle vascular resistance in hypertensive salt-sensitive rats. The similarity in vascular densities among groups indicates that structural rarefaction of arterioles does not contribute to any increase in spinotrapezius muscle resistance at this stage of salt-induced hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Renal transplantations were performed, using microsurgical techniques, with adult male two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats (n = 9) and sham-operated normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 8) as kidney donors and with F1 hybrids, bred from Wistar-Kyoto and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat parents, as recipients. Systolic blood pressure before surgery was 200 +/- 2.7 mm Hg in hypertensive and 115 +/- 1.7 mm Hg in normotensive donors and 144 +/- 7.1 and 138 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in the two groups of recipients. Renal hypertension in donors was maintained for 14 weeks before surgery was performed and the nonischemic kidneys were transplanted. Bilaterally nephrectomized recipients of renal grafts from hypertensive donors developed sustained hypertension (185 +/- 3.9 mm Hg). In contrast, in recipients of renal grafts from normotensive donors, blood pressure decreased significantly to the level of the donors (111 +/- 3.7 mm Hg). Posttransplantation hypertension in recipients of renal grafts from hypertensive donors was associated with intrarenal vascular hypertrophy, smaller kidneys, a decreased glomerular filtration rate, an increased plasma urea concentration, and polydipsia as compared with normotensive transplanted controls. Renal pyelograms revealed no gross anatomic alterations of transplanted kidneys. Our data indicate that secondary damage to the renal grafts caused by high perfusion pressure before transplantation can induce hypertension in recipients of these kidneys. Furthermore, our data suggest that renal mechanisms may be necessary to maintain borderline hypertension in F1 hybrids.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies using renal transplantation suggested that the genotype of a homograft kidney plays the primary role in determining chronic arterial pressure levels in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats, but this conclusion derived largely from observations during low NaCl diet. Recent studies indicate that extrarenal factors, including the sympathetic nervous system, play a critical role in the development of NaCl-induced hypertension in DS rats. To assess the contribution of extrarenal and renal factors in the development of NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl rats, we performed renal transplantation in DS and DR rats. Both kidneys of the recipient were removed at the time of transplantation. Four groups of rats (n = 18-23 in each group) were fed a high NaCl (8.0%) diet for 2 weeks after renal transplantation. These included DRR, DRS, DSR, and DSS, where DR or DS indicates the recipient strain and the subscript indicates the homograft strain. Mean arterial pressure was measured from the femoral artery in conscious rats. On a high NaCl diet, mean arterial pressure was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in DRR (103 +/- 2 mm Hg; mean +/- SEM) compared with DRS (145 +/- 5 mm Hg), DSR (151 +/- 7 mm Hg), and DSS (160 +/- 5 mm Hg). The finding that DR rats with a DS kidney (DRS) developed hypertension during high NaCl diet confirms the concept that the kidney plays an important hypertensinogenic role in the Dahl strain. The fact that DS rats with a DR kidney (DSR) also developed hypertension indicates that extrarenal factors also contribute significantly to NaCl-induced hypertension in DS rats.\r"

  ".U": "90202382\r", 
  ".W": "Monitoring functional status in patients with cardiac disease has traditionally been done by using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system. For various reasons, we found the NYHA system difficult to apply to elderly patients. We proposed that the functional status questionnaire (FSQ), which measures the ability to perform tasks, would more accurately assess the functional status of the elderly. In a study in 37 patients with a mean age of 76 years, who had aortic stenosis, we measured FSQ and NYHA scores at baseline, 1 month and 3 months. The difference in questionnaires was evident by the 3-month measurement. Individual patients were better evaluated by the FSQ. Six patients had an FSQ score of less than 72 (suggesting severe functional impairment) at 3 months but only two patients gave symptoms scored as NYHA class III or IV (cardiac disability). Five of six patients had a recurrent cardiac event subsequent to the 3-month follow-up. Changes in functional performance preceded symptomatic deterioration that was reflected only by the FSQ scores. The FSQ system more reliably predicted outcome than the NYHA system and appears to be a more useful tool in the evaluation of elderly patients with cardiac disease.\r"

Interviews with 14 individuals who had an MI provided the major source of data. The findings of this study indicate that the process of adjustment after MI is variable and incorporates four stages. In each of these stages the individual focuses on the core process of regaining a sense of personal control. The first stage of the adjustment process involves attempts to defend oneself against a threatened loss of control. In the second stage, the individual struggles to come to terms with the MI. Throughout the third stage, numerous strategies are used to reestablish a sense of control. If control is reestablished the individual progresses to the final stage of adjustment. The hallmarks of the final stage include an acceptance of limitations, a refocusing on issues other than the MI, and a perceived sense of mastery.\r"

Side-lying measurements were reproducible, accurate, and clinically acceptable for surgical ICU patients, but not for medical ICU patients. The inconsistency was partly explained by the reference points used for transducer releveling in lateral positions. Surgical ICU used the fourth intercostal space and dependent midaxillary line; medical ICU used the fourth intercostal space and sternum. Reversing the leveling procedure in each ICU reduced surgical unit accuracy to an unacceptable level; medical unit accuracy was increased but was still too low for clinical acceptance. Further research is needed to identify appropriate anatomic reference points for transducer releveling in the side-lying position and to clarify which patient groups may be safely monitored by using this position.\r"

Through content analysis, accounts of different subjects were compared, and several themes were isolated that dominated the dyspneic experience. The themes were fear, helplessness, loss of vitality, preoccupation, and legitimacy. Each theme was expanded by integrating accounts of dyspnea previously reported in the literature with the field study data. Substantiated descriptions of the five themes are presented to sensitize nurses to patients' perceptions of dyspnea and nursing behaviors during hospitalization for the acute phase of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

The French version of the CCFNI was given to subjects for self-reporting at the end of a 15-minute face-to-face interview. The reliability of the French version yielded 0.91 as Cronbach alpha coefficient. The Spearman-Brown split-half coefficient was 0.89, and the Guttman split-half coefficient was 0.88.

In this study, the stability of the NE-SO4 response was examined during sustained exercise at a constant relative intensity. Seven trained men bicycled at 78 +/- 3% of their maximal O2 consumption for 28 min and then rested on the ergometer for a comparable duration. After a 30-min rest, plasma samples were collected through an indwelling catheter at 7-min intervals during the exercise and recovery periods. Free NE and epinephrine increased sixfold during exercise. These changes were accompanied by increases in sulfoconjugated catecholamines, but only NE-SO4 achieved statistical significance (rest, 712 +/- 602; exercise, 1,329 +/- 1,163 pg/ml). This occurred at three collection periods (14, 21, and 28 min). Approximately 35, 52, and 95% of NE, epinephrine, and dopamine, respectively, existed as sulfoconjugated during exercise. Subject variation was present in the sulfoconjugated catecholamine response that could not be attributed to corresponding differences in circulating free catecholamine release. These findings implicate blood flow as a factor in the sulfoconjugation of NE, but not epinephrine or dopamine.\r"

Other studies have shown that the mean diameter of the airways is exponentially related to order of branching. This paper demonstrates that both observations are compatible with a fractal model of branching, and because airway branching is fractal, this may explain why both are also true of the bronchial tree. Furthermore, the exponential relationship of mean diameter with generation in the larger airways, demonstrated by Weibel, is shown to result from the exponential relation of diameter with order in the fractal model.\r"

P-Q coordinates were obtained by varying Q through systemic fistulas. Seven group 1 dogs were embolized with autologous blood clot to produce marked pulmonary hypertension and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and PI increased from 15 to 41 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and from 8.8 to 31 mmHg (P less than 0.001), respectively. Before and after embolization we assessed effects of increased LAP, produced by inflation of a left atrial balloon, on PAP at constant Q. Embolization depressed the mean slope of this relationship from 0.78 to 0.16 (P less than 0.001). Subsequently, six group 2 dogs were embolized to produce moderate pulmonary hypertension with a mean PI of 22 mmHg. This value was significantly less than PI in group 1 (P less than 0.01). After embolization, the slope of the PAP-LAP relationship was greater in group 2 than group 1: 0.47 vs. 0.16 (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the upstream transmission of left atrial pressure is inversely related to PI and that marked embolic pulmonary hypertension produces an effective vascular waterfall.\r"

The ratio of MHC1 to MHC2 was the same along the bronchial tree in animals of the same age, but it changed with age (mature, young, suckling, and fetus), ranging from 0.8 in the mature to 2.2 in the fetus. Stress developed in airway (trachea, bronchus, and bronchiole) and parenchymal preparations in response to carbachol and histamine (mN/mm2) was normalized for myosin content (N/mm2 myosin). Airways from sucklings always developed the greatest stress to carbachol and histamine with the rank order of maximum force (Emax) suckling greater than fetus greater than young greater than mature for carbachol in large airways. Airway ranking to histamine was similar except that Emax of fetal bronchus and bronchiole were least. In parenchymal strips, mature animals gave strong responses to carbachol and histamine compared with other age groups. Sensitivity to carbachol was increased in the suckling trachea; otherwise it did not vary with age. Chemically skinned tracheal fibers exhibited three- to fourfold greater sensitivity to Ca2+ in fetal and suckling airways compared with the older animals. It is concluded that maturation of smooth muscle occurs in the expression of myosin, in the Ca2(+)-force relationships of the contractile machinery, and in the pharmacological responsiveness of the intact smooth muscle, with the latter greatest at or soon after birth.\r"

Neither low-dose alloxan alone nor SVCH alone [superior vena caval pressure (Psvc) = 11.0 +/- 3.1 (SD) mmHg] increased lung water significantly. The SVCH coupled with low-dose alloxan (Psvc = 11.3 +/- 2.7 mmHg) doubled extravascular lung thermal volume measured by the thermal-dye dilution technique within 1 h (5.3 +/- 0.9 ml/kg at base line and 10.9 +/- 4.7 ml/kg at 1 h), then remained unchanged (12.5 +/- 5.7 ml/kg at 3 h). This increase in lung water was confirmed by gravimetric method (5.69 +/- 1.71 g/g blood-free dry wt).

We present a theoretical model of diaphragm motion that predicts that the decrease in WZapp during inspiration is the result not only of shortening of the diaphragm muscle but also of expansion of the lower rib cage. To test our model, static lengths of costal LD, WZapp, and Drc were measured in 15 normal volunteers using posteroanterior chest X-ray films taken at four or five lung volumes spanning the vital capacity. We found a strong correlation between WZapp and LD: WZapp = 0.95 LD - 15.2 (R2 = 0.81). Expressing WZapp as a combined function of LD and Drc significantly reduced the unexplained variance in WZapp: WZapp = 0.96 LD - 0.47 Drc - 2.18 (R2 = 0.95). The coefficients for LD and Drc derived statistically are close to those predicted from our theoretical model. Repeating the analysis with LD as the dependent variable, we obtained similar results: LD = 0.85 WZapp + 17.1 (R2 = 0.81) and LD = 0.98 WZapp + 0.46 Drc + 3.48 (R2 = 0.94). We conclude that shortening of WZapp is dependent on both diaphragm shortening and rib cage expansion and that roentgenographic measurements of Drc and WZapp can be used to predict diaphragm length and length change.\r"

On return to sea level, VO2 max was the same as the prealtitude value, whereas an increase in O2 deficit (29%) and in short-term running performance (17%) was observed (P less than 0.05). GAS showed maintained capillary supply but a 10% decrease in mitochondrial enzyme activities (P less than 0.05), whereas an increase in capillary supply (P less than 0.05) but unchanged mitochondrial enzyme activities were observed in TRI. Buffer capacity was increased by 6% in both GAS and TRI (P less than 0.05). A positive correlation was found between the relative increase in buffer capacity of GAS and short-term running time (P less than 0.05). Thus the present study indicates no effect of 2 wk of altitude training on VO2 max but provides evidence to suggest an improvement in short-term exercise performance, which may be the result of an increase in muscle buffer capacity.\r"

With increasing %MVC, the power spectrum of the MS enlarges and tends to be multimodal beyond 30% MVC. Independent of the method, the mean frequency is approximately 11 Hz at the lower tasks, and then it increases up to 15 Hz at 80% MVC and to 22 Hz at 100% MVC. When the effort is increased the relative power in the 15- to 45-Hz bandwidth (range of firing rate of the motor units with fast-twitch fibers) from 20% reaches 55% of the power in the 6- to 45-Hz bandwidth (firing rate range of motor units with slow- and fast-twitch fibers). Our results obtained by the two different modeling approaches confirm the reliability of the sound signal. Moreover, it appears that from the MS the motor unit activation pattern can be retrieved.\r"

In 13 healthy Na(+)-depleted subjects FBF was measured by the 133Xe washout technique; subcutaneous and muscle blood flows were determined separately. FBF was measured during supine rest, after the arm was lowered, and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The measurements were repeated during intra-arterial saralasin infusion in six subjects and after intravenous administration of enalapril in seven subjects. FBF decreased and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) increased during arm lowering and LBNP, as the result of local and central adrenergic reflexes, respectively. We observed similar FBF and FVR values after both saralasin and enalapril, except for a decrease in FVR at rest after enalapril. It is concluded that, in the human forearm, angiotensin II is not necessary for sympathetic vasoconstrictor reflexes but may, through a central effect, have some influence on arteriolar tone at rest.\r"

Adult female Wistar rats were kept for 28 days with hindlimbs suspended. For the next 28 days, rats were assigned to a cage-sedentary or daily running group. Compared with control soleus muscles, 28 days of hindlimb suspension reduced the mass and fiber cross-sectional area to 58 and 53% of control values, respectively, and decreased type I fibers from 92 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 2%. During recovery, clusters of damaged fibers were observed in the soleus muscle, and this observation was more pronounced in trained animals. Type IIc fibers appeared transiently during recovery, and their presence was exacerbated with training, as IIc fibers increased to approximately 20% of the total by day 14 of recovery and were no longer evident at day 28. Although muscle wet mass does not differ as a result of mode of recovery at day 14, training transiently decreased the overall fiber area compared with sedentary recovery at this point. By day 28 of recovery the morphological characteristics of soleus muscle in the trained group did not differ from control muscle, whereas in the sedentary group muscle mass and overall fiber cross-sectional area were approximately 14% less than control values.\r"

There was no correlation between the temperature variation and skinfold thickness at a site or with estimations of whole body fat content. These findings imply that errors in mean skin temperature measurement could arise from probe mislocation and/or subcutaneous fat distribution and that the problem becomes more acute with increasing cold stress. However, the magnitudes of these errors cannot be easily predicted from common anthropometric measurements.\r"

Tissue blood flow was studied with 15 micron-diameter radionuclide-labeled microspheres injected into the left ventricle during steady conditions. The inspiratory and expiratory muscles comprised 2.41 and 3.05% of body weight, respectively, and received 6.17 and 3.75% of the cardiac output at rest. With maximal exercise, heart rate (from 55 +/- 3 to 218 +/- 4 beats/min), mean aortic pressure (from 125 +/- 5 to 170 +/- 6 mmHg), and cardiac output (from 96 +/- 11 to 730 +/- 78 ml.min-1.kg-1) increased markedly. During exercise blood flow increased significantly in all respiratory muscles (P less than 0.0001) as vascular resistance decreased precipitously. Marked heterogeneity of perfusion existed among various inspiratory as well as expiratory muscles during exercise. Among the inspiratory muscles, the highest perfusion occurred in the diaphragm followed by serratus ventralis, and among the expiratory muscles, the highest perfusion occurred in the internal oblique abdominis and the transverse thoracis (triangularis sterni). Collectively, the inspiratory (8.44%) and expiratory (6.35%) muscle blood flow comprised 14.8 +/- 1.2% of the cardiac output during maximal exercise, a significant increase above resting value, whereas renal fraction of cardiac output decreased from 21% (at rest) to 0.72%.\r"

Unlike endotoxin-protected rats (where lung antioxidant enzyme activity is elevated after hyperoxia), postexposure superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in the lungs of serum-protected rats were not affected. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) in protective sera were increased. This study demonstrates that increases in lung SOD and CAT activity are not required for endotoxin protection from hyperoxia and suggests that TNF and IL-1 may participate in the mechanism of endotoxin protection.\r"

Pentobarbital-anesthetized 2- and 8-wk-old piglets received CPR after ventricular fibrillation. At compression rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 150/min, duty cycle (compression duration/total cycle time) was increased from 10 to 80% by 10% increments. Mean aortic and sagittal sinus pressures, pulsatile displacement, and deformity of the anterior chest wall were measured. Increasing duty cycle increased cerebral perfusion pressure until chest relaxation time was compromised. Inadequate chest recoil, development of static chest deformation, and limitation of pulsatile chest wall movement occurred in both age groups when relaxation time was very short (150-200 ms in 2-wk-old piglets, 250-300 ms in 8-wk-old piglets). These changes in chest geometry correlated with deterioration of cerebral perfusion pressure only in 8-wk-old piglets. In the younger group, perfusion pressures plateaued but did not deteriorate. These data emphasize the importance of duty cycle in generating cerebral perfusion pressure and indicate that younger animals can tolerate high compression rates except at extremely long duty cycles.\r"

On consecutive days, rats received saline icv, alpha-helical CRF icv, and no treatment 30 min before treadmill exercise (TMX). Increases in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to TMX (16.1-28.6 m/min) were similar after icv administration of saline or no treatment. In rats receiving saline icv or no treatment, estimated vascular resistance increased in the mesenteric and renal regions and declined in the iliac (hindlimb) region. After icv administration of alpha-helical CRF9-41, HR and MAP responses during TMX were significantly attenuated. In addition, TMX-induced elevations of estimated mesenteric vascular resistance and iliac blood flow velocity were blunted after CRF receptor blockade. These altered cardiovascular and hemodynamic responses were ultimately reflected in the animals' compromised ability to run. The results suggest that the central nervous system actions of endogenous CRF are necessary for the full expression of the cardiovascular adjustments to TMX in the conscious rat.\r"

To test whether endogenously produced adenosine (e.g., from ATP hydrolysis) shares these deleterious effects on substrate mobilization and utilization and thus limits maximum thermogenesis in vivo, adenosine deaminase (converts adenosine to inosine) was given to rats 15 min before cold exposure. Significant (P less than 0.05) increases in thermogenesis were observed under both well-fed (100 units/kg ip) and food-rationed (200 units/kg ip) states. Significant (P less than 0.05) increases in thermogenesis and cold resistance were also observed after pretreatment with selective adenosine receptor antagonists [8-cyclopentyltheophylline (1 microgram/kg ip) greater than 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine (1.25 mg/kg ip) greater than aminophylline (18.7 mg/kg ip)], indicating an A1-receptor-mediated effect. These results indicate that endogenously released adenosine can indeed attenuate the thermogenic capacity in severe cold and that adenosine antagonists, especially those selective for A1-receptor, are useful in improving cold resistance under varying nutritional states.\r"

To determine if beta-adrenergic blockade altered these changes in the plasma concentration of catecholamines with exercise conditioning, we studied the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on NE and EPI at rest and during exercise in 24 healthy, male subjects after a 6-wk exercise training program. The subjects were randomized to placebo (P), atenolol 50 mg twice daily (A), and nadolol 40 mg twice daily (N). There were no changes in resting NE and EPI compared with pretraining values in any subject group. During the same absolute level of submaximal exercise NE decreased in P and A but was unchanged in N, whereas EPI decreased only in P. At maximal exercise all three groups developed significant increases in NE after training that paralleled increases in systolic blood pressure. EPI at maximal exercise increased after training with N but was unchanged with P or A. These training-induced changes in plasma catecholamine levels were masked or blunted when the A and N groups were studied while still on medication after training. Thus beta-adrenergic blockade has important effects on adaptations of the sympathetic nervous system to training, especially during submaximal exercise.\r"

Unperfused lungs were employed, because vascular perfusion had no effect on acute (0- to 60-min) NO2 absorption rates. We additionally found the following: 1) Uptake was proportional to exposure rates (2-14 micrograms NO2/min; 10-63 ppm; 37 degrees C) but saturated with exposures greater than or equal to 14 micrograms NO2/min. 2) Uptake was temperature (22-48 degrees C) dependent but, regardless of temperature, attained apparent saturation at 10.6 micrograms NO2/min. 3) Lung surface area (SA) was altered by increasing functional residual capacity (FRC). Expanded SA (8 ml FRC) and temperature (48 degrees C) both raised fractional uptakes (greater than or equal to 0.81) relative to 4 ml FRC, 37 degrees C (0.67). Uptake rates normalized per unit estimated SA revealed no independent effect of FRC on fractional uptake. However, temperature produced a profound effect (48 degrees C = 0.93; 4 and 8 ml FRC = 0.54). 4) Arrhenius plots (ln k' vs. 1/T), which utilized derived reactive uptake coefficients (k'), showed linearity (r2 = 0.94) and yielded an activation energy of 7,536 kcal.g-1.mol-1 and Q10 of 1.43, all consistent with a reaction-mediated process. These findings, particularly the effects of temperature, suggest that acute NO2 uptake in pulmonary air spaces is, in part, rate limited by chemical reaction of NO2 with epithelial surface constituents rather than by direct physical solubility.\r"

The recordings were obtained during a calibrated isometric contraction sustained for 20 s against a closed stopcock at functional residual capacity (FRC) level for EMGra (expiratory effort) and at pulmonary volume greater than 90% vital capacity for EMGdi and EMGra (inspiratory effort). After eliminating the electrocardiographic artifact, the EMG signal was processed to obtain its root-mean-square (rms) value and three parameters of its frequency spectrum, total energy (Etot), centroid frequency (fc), and high-to-low ratio (H/L). The results show that EMGdi is not modified by TW. On the other hand rms and Etot of EMGra are always increased at TW = 25 degrees C compared with TW = 40 degrees C, whereas fc and H/L decrease with temperature during the expiratory effort at FRC level but do not vary during inspiratory effort at high pulmonary volume. These results, compared with those previously published for cooled limb muscles, show that TW can elicit EMG alterations on the superficial respiratory muscles through two mechanisms, an intrinsic mechanism due to the local variation in muscle temperature and an extrinsic mechanism acting upon the control system of the muscle contraction. Linked alterations of the muscular mechanical activity probably account for the observed effects of TW on the statics and the dynamics of the pulmonary volumes.\r"

Acetazolamide-treated horses had a 13-mmol/l base deficit at rest, higher arterial Po2 at rest and during exercise, higher arterial and mixed venous Pco2 during exercise, and a 48-s reduction in run time. Arterial pH was lower during exercise but not in recovery after acetazolamide. Blood temperature responses were unaffected by acetazolamide administration. O2 uptake was similar during exercise and recovery after acetazolamide treatment, whereas CO2 production was lower during exercise. Muscle [glycogen] and pH were lower at rest, whereas heart rate, muscle pH and [lactate], and plasma [lactate] and [K+] were lower and plasma [Cl-] higher following exercise after acetazolamide treatment. These data demonstrate that acetazolamide treatment aggravates the CO2 retention and acidosis occurring in the horse during heavy exercise. This could negatively affect muscle metabolism and exercise capacity.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of aging on changes in maximal expiratory flow rates and specific airway conductance after a deep breath were evaluated in 64 normal subjects. Flow rates (Vp) on partial expiratory flow-volume curves (PEFV), initiated from 60-70% of the vital capacity (VC), were compared with those (Vc) on maximal flow-volume curves (MEFV), initiated from total lung capacity (TLC), at a lung volume corresponding to 25% of VC on the MEFV curves. Specific airway conductance was measured before (sGaw) and after a deep inspiration (sGawDI). Bronchodilation after inspiration to TLC was inferred by Vp/Vc less than 1 and sGaw/sGawDI less than 1. The mean Vp was less than Vc. However, the ratio Vp/Vc increased significantly with age (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001). Specific conductance also increased after a deep inspiration (sGaw less than sGawDI). The ratio sGaw/sGawDIj increased slightly but significantly with age (r = 0.28, P less than 0.02). Measurement of lung elastic recoil pressures before and after a deep breath in a subgroup of patients (n = 14) suggested that the age-related increase in Vp/Vc was secondary to a decrement in the ability of a deep breath to decrease the upstream airway resistance. These findings suggest that even though changes in airway size after a deep breath as measured by sGaw/sGawDI have minimal age dependence, aging diminishes expiratory flow rates of MEFV curves relative to PEFV curves because of a decrease in the ability of a deep breath to increase the size of the peripheral airways.\r"

  ".W": "To study the in vivo recruitment of different fiber types and their metabolic properties, 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-NMRS) of the human calf muscle was performed in seven normal sedentary subjects. In the exhaustive exercise protocol used, the work load was increased every minute during 5 min. This resulted in a prominent split of the Pi resonance in all subjects, indicating pH compartmentation in the muscles studied. From the chemical shift of the Pi peaks relative to phosphocreatine (PCr) at the end of the exercise, intracellular pH (pHi) averaged 6.92 +/- 0.05 (SD) in compartment 1 and 6.23 +/- 0.15 in compartment 2. The recovery of both Pi resonances after exercise could be followed easily in five of these subjects. The recovery rate of the Pi peak is a good estimate of the oxidative metabolism at the end of the exercise. A monoexponential regression analysis showed that the mean initial recovery rate S0 was 2.49 +/- 0.17%/s in compartment 1 and only 0.87 +/- 0.12%/s in compartment 2, indicating aerobic function three times higher in compartment 1 at the end of exercise. The mean relative ATP fraction dropped significantly (P less than 0.001), from 20.0 +/- 1.0% of the total 31P signal integral before exercise to 14.0 +/- 1.6% at the end of exercise. The simultaneous visualization of two compartments, in good order, one with high pHi and fast recovery and another with low pHi and slow recovery, is rationalized by the different metabolic behavior of type I and II fibers in human calf muscle in response to exhaustive exercise. This study demonstrates that 31P-NMRS is an excellent noninvasive procedure to quantify aerobic metabolism in both fiber types simultaneously.\r"

Testing at pre-, mid-, and posttraining included 1) 1 RM bench press and squat with and 2) without prestretch using free weights; 3)isokinetic peak force and power for bench press and squat at 5 degrees/s, and isotonic peak velocity and power for bench press with 20-kg load and squat with 70-kg load; 4) hydraulic peak bench press force and power, and peak knee extension torque and power at fast and slow speeds; and 5) surface anthropometry (fatfolds and girths to estimate upper arm and thigh volume and muscle area). Changes in overall fatness, muscularity, and muscle + bone cross-sectional area of the limbs did not differ between groups (P greater than 0.05).

  ".W": "To clarify the independent changes of insulations of body tissues (Itissue) and wet suit (Isuit) in the wet-suited subject during underwater exercise, overall heat flow from the skin (Htissue) and wet suit (Hsuit) and esophageal (Tes), skin (Tsk), and wet suit temperatures were measured at 1, 2, and 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) at critical water temperature (Tcw). The average Tcw in nine wet-suited men (23-38 yr) was 22.3 +/- 0.2, 26.3 +/- 0.2, and 28.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C (SE) at 1, 2, and 2.5 ATA, respectively. At Tcw of each pressure male volunteers wearing 5-mm neoprene wet suits completed three 2-h experiments while immersed up to the neck. During one experiment the subjects remained at rest, and in the other two they exercised on an underwater ergometer at two different intensities (2 and 3 met). Tes significantly declined (P less than 0.05) over 2 h from 37.1 to 36.5 degrees C during rest in each pressure. The 2-met exercise prevented Tes from falling in all pressures, and the 3-met exercise elevated Tes by 0.2-0.3 degrees C. There was no exercise-dependent difference in Isuit, but a pressure-dependent difference was remarkable. The Itissue at rest was identical for all pressures; however, it progressively decreased as a function of exercise intensity. It is concluded that overall Itissue is entirely determined by work intensity at Tcw, but not by atmospheric pressure. On the contrary, Isuit at Tcw is solely dependent on the pressure, but not on the work intensity.\r"

  ".W": "Respiratory impedance may be studied by measuring airway flow (Vaw) when pressure is varied at the mouth (input impedance) or around the chest (transfer impedance). A third possibility, which had not been investigated so far, is to apply pressure variations simultaneously at the two places, that is to vary ambient pressure (Pam). This provides respiratory impedance to ambient pressure changes (Zapc = Vaw/Pam). In that situation airway impedance (Zaw) and tissue impedance (Zt) are mechanically in parallel, and both are in series with alveolar gas impedance (Zg): Zapc = Zaw + Zg + Zaw.Zg/Zt. We assessed the frequency dependence of Zapc from 0.05 to 2 Hz in nine normal subjects submitted to sinusoidal Pam changes of 2-4 kPa peak to peak. The real part of Zapc (Rapc) was of 6.2 kPa.1(-1).s at 0.05 Hz and decreased to 1.9 kPa.1(-1).s at 2 Hz. Similarly the effective compliance (Capc), computed from the imaginary part of Zapc, decreased from 0.045 1.kPa-1 at 0.05 Hz to 0.027 1.kPa-1 at 2 Hz. Breathing against an added resistance of 0.46 kPa.1(-1).s exaggerated the negative frequency dependence of both Rapc and Capc. When values of airway resistance and inertance derived from transfer impedance data were introduced, Zapc was used to compute effective tissue resistance (Rt) and compliance (Ct). Rt was found to decrease from 0.32 to 0.15 kPa.1(-1).s and Ct from 1.11 to 0.64 1.kPa-1 between 0.25 and 2 Hz. Ct was slightly lower with the added resistance. These results are in good agreement with the data obtained by other approaches.\r"

  ".W": "The neonatal ventilatory response to hypoxia is characterized by initial transient stimulation and subsequent respiratory depression. It is unknown, however, whether this response is also exhibited by the upper airway muscles that regulate nasal, laryngeal, and pharyngeal patency. We therefore compared electromyogram (EMG) amplitudes and minute EMGs for the diaphragm (DIA), alae nasi (AN), posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA), and genioglossus (GG) muscles in 12 anesthetized spontaneously breathing piglets during inhalation of 12% O2 over 10 min. Minute EMG for the DIA responded to hypoxia with an initial transient increase and subsequent return to prehypoxia levels by 10 min. Hypoxia also stimulated all three upper airway muscles. In contrast to the DIA EMG, however, AN, PCA, and GG EMGs all remained significantly above prehypoxia levels after 10 min of hypoxia. We have thus demonstrated that the initial stimulation and subsequent depression of the DIA EMG after 12% O2 inhalation contrast with the sustained increase in AN, PCA, and GG EMGs during hypoxia. We speculate that 1) central inhibition during neonatal hypoxia is primarily distributed to the motoneuron pools regulating DIA activation and 2) peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and/or central disinhibition induced by hypoxia preferentially influence those motoneuron pools that regulate upper airway muscle activation, causing the different hypoxic responses of these muscle groups in the young piglet.\r"

One group of rats remained intact, whereas a second group was barodenervated. Both groups of rats retained arterial chemoreceptive function as demonstrated by augmented ventilation in response to hypoxia. The cardiovascular effects to varying inspired levels of O2 and CO2 were examined and compared between intact and barodenervated rats. No differences between groups were noted in response to mild hypercapnia (5% CO2); however, the bradycardia and reduction in cardiac output observed in intact rats breathing 10% CO2 were eliminated by barodenervation. In addition, hypocapnic hypoxia caused a marked fall in blood pressure and total peripheral resistance (TPR) in barodenervated rats compared with controls. Similar differences in TPR were observed between the groups in response to isocapnic and hypercapnic hypoxia as well. It is concluded that the arterial baroreflex is an important component of the overall cardiovascular responses to both hypercapnic and hypoxic stimuli in the conscious rat.\r"

However, most controlled experimental studies on the efficacy of such grafts have been conducted on muscles with a relatively small mass and over a limited recovery period. Therefore, selected cellular and matrix component properties of the comparatively large dog gracilis muscle (75 g) were studied 9-12 mo after orthotopic neurovascular grafting. The grafted muscle wet weights were 71% of the contralateral control (sham-operated) muscles. In addition, the concentrations of noncollagenous protein (13%), DNA (28%), and RNA (34%) were significantly reduced in the grafts. However, the concentration of collagen was significantly higher (41%) in the grafts. In this regard, the type III collagen phenotype showed the greatest relative increase. There was no difference between the grafted and control proteoglycan concentration. The metabolic profiles of the grafted muscles were significantly different from control. The activities of myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (34%) and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (25%) were reduced, whereas citrate synthase remained unchanged. These data suggest that recovery of up to 1 yr was insufficient for the normalization of several connective tissue matrix components and biochemical properties of the grafts.\r"

Microinjections of SP (0.4-1.5 nmol) into the ventrolateral medulla oblongata (VLM), (nuclei gigantocellularis, facialis, ambiguus, and reticularis lateralis) or into the dorsomedial medulla oblongata (DM, nucleus tractus solitarius) and its ventral surroundings dose dependently increased tidal volume (VT) and/or minute ventilation. In sensitive areas, the ventilatory stimulation was initiated within minutes, peaked around 8-10 min, and slowly returned to normal over 30-45 min after the injection. In the VLM sites, the increase in VT was generally accompanied by a decrease in respiratory frequency (f), whereas in the DM, f increased in parallel with VT. Furthermore, within the VLM, the respiratory response patterns differed with the definite location of the SP injection. A shortening of inspiratory time was observed in the ventromedial part, the ventrolateral portion of the nucleus paragigantocellularis and ventral to the nucleus facialis. In contrast, a lengthening of expiratory time was seen when SP was injected or applied more laterally along the ventral portion of nucleus facialis and near or directly on the ventral medullary surface. Application of [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]SP before or after SP completely antagonized the excitatory effects of SP on ventilation. The SP antagonist administered into the VLM decreased the ventilatory response to hypoxic breathing but caused no change during hyperoxic conditions.\r"

Pathogen-free F344 male rats were inoculated into each nostril with Sendai virus or with sterile culture medium. Six days after the inoculation, a threshold dose of capsaicin (75 micrograms/kg) or the vehicle used to dissolve the capsaicin was injected intravenously, and Monastral blue pigment was injected to measure the increase in vascular permeability produced by the capsaicin or vehicle (n = 6 per group). Five minutes later the tracheae were fixed by vascular perfusion, removed, and treated with a histochemical reaction for myeloperoxidase to stain the neutrophils in the mucosa, and the magnitude of the Monastral blue extravasation was determined both by stereological point counting and by microspectrophotometry. Capsaicin produced a larger number of Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels in the rats infected with Sendai virus than in the uninfected rats or in any of the rats that received only the vehicle. In addition, capsaicin further increased the already large number of neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa of the infected rats. However, in the dose used, it had no detectable effect on neutrophils in the uninfected rats. We conclude that Sendai virus infection causes neutrophil chemotaxis but does not increase vascular permeability in the trachea; it does, however, make the trachea abnormally susceptible to neurogenic inflammation, as manifested by an unusually large increase in vascular permeability and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils in response to sensory nerve stimulation by capsaicin.\r"

  ".W": "In isolated canine lung lobes perfused with a pulsatile pump, arterial occlusions were performed and the postocclusion arterial pressure profiles were analyzed to estimate the pulmonary capillary pressure. A solenoid valve interposed between the pump and the lobar artery was used to perform arterial occlusions at several instants equally distributed within a pressure cycle. Double occlusions were also accomplished by simultaneously activating the solenoid valve and clamping the venous outflow of the lung lobe. To analyze an arterial occlusion pressure profile, we computed the best monoexponential fit of the pressure decay over a short period of time after the occlusion maneuvers. Two estimates of the capillary pressure were derived from this analysis: 1) the extrapolation of the exponential fit to the instant of occlusion, and 2) the point at which the recorded pressure decay curve merges with the exponential fit. The pressures thus determined were compared with the double occlusion pressure that provided an independent estimate of the pulmonary capillary pressure. Our results show that, under a wide range of conditions, the estimates of the capillary pressure obtained from the arterial occlusion data are nearly equal to the double occlusion pressures. Additionally, we estimated the capillary pressure variations within a pressure cycle by examining the occlusion pressures sampled at different instants of the cycle. The pulsatility of the pulmonary microvascular pressure varied with the pump frequency as well as the state of arterial and venous vasoaction. These variations are consistent with the representation of the lung vasculature as a low-pass filter.\r"

By the use of immunocytochemical methods, the peptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were colocalized in airway epithelial nerve fibers. Two days after wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was injected into the nodose ganglion, fibers containing WGA immunoreactivity (IR) were detected in the airway epithelium. SP-like immunoreactivity (LI) and CGRP-LI were demonstrated separately in the WGA-IR fibers, establishing their origin from nerve cell bodies of nodose ganglion. Vagal transection inferior to the nodose ganglion reduced the number of SP- and CGRP-IR fibers by greater than 90% in ipsilateral airways. In contralateral airways, SP-IR fibers were substantially reduced, whereas the effect on CGRP-IR fibers was not statistically significant. Vagotomy superior to the nodose ganglion did not alter the density of peptide-IR fibers. The results prove that SP- and CGRP-IR nerve fibers of cat airway epithelium originate from nerve cell bodies in the nodose ganglion and that SP- and CGRP-like peptides may be stored together in some nerve fibers of the airway epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of three variables (different breathing circuits, breath selected for analysis, and alveolar dead space ventilation) on the accuracy of noninvasive cardiac output determinations with the Fick CO2 (indirect) equation. We compared noninvasive determinations with invasive thermodilution measurements over a wide range of cardiac outputs in 17 2-mo-old pigs anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide and paralyzed with either pancuronium or d-tubocurare. We found that rebreathing and nonrebreathing circuits provide accurate cardiac output determinations and that the optimal breath for analysis with either the rebreathing or nonrebreathing technique appears to depend on the cardiac output. When alveolar dead space was increased by using positional changes and the intracardiac administration of glass beads, there was still a good correlation between noninvasive and invasive cardiac output determinations. We conclude that both rebreathing and nonrebreathing techniques of indirect Fick cardiac output determinations correlate well with thermodilution measures over a wide range of cardiac outputs and alveolar dead space/tidal volume fractions.\r"

  ".W": "The lung volume at which airway closure begins during expiration (closing volume, CV) can be measured 1) with a radioactive bolus inspired at residual volume (RV) and 2) with the single-breath N2 elimination test. In previous studies in dogs, we observed that N2 CV was systematically larger than 133Xe bolus CV (Xe CV) [N2 CV %vital capacity (VC) = 35 +/- 2.3 (SE) vs. Xe CV %VC = 24 +/- 2.2, P less than 0.01]. Because the regional RV in the dog is evenly distributed throughout the lung and all airways closed at RV, N2 CV is related to the regional distribution of the tracheal N2; differences between N2 and Xe CV could then be related to the size of the inhaled dead space. Simultaneous measurements of Xe and N2 CV were performed at various sites of Xe bolus injection while the regional distribution of the bolus was measured. Injections at the level of the carina increased Xe CV to a value (30 +/- 1.4%VC) near simultaneous N2 CV (32 +/- 1.5%VC) and increased the unevenness of regional distribution of the Xe bolus. The difference between N2 and Xe CV is then the result of the size of the inspired tracheal dead space. Moreover, comparisons between different values of Xe CV require injections of the boluses at the same distance from the carina.\r"

  ".W": "The dynamic response of oxygen uptake (VO2) was investigated with two different cycle ergometer tests in which the work rate changed as a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS). One sequence had 15 units, each of 30-s duration for a total of 450 s (PRBS1). The second had 63 units, each of 5-s duration for a total of 315 s (PRBS2). The useful range of frequencies available for investigation of the dynamic characteristics of the VO2 response as described by their bandwidth were 0.002-0.013 Hz for PRBS1 and 0.003-0.089 Hz for PRBS2. Eight subjects each completed both PRBS tests. Data from four or five consecutive sequences were ensemble averaged to reduce the biological noise. A Fourier analysis was then conducted, with the range of frequencies investigated spanning those of the bandwidth for PRBS2. This was up to the 28th harmonic. For PRBS1, the VO2 response could be adequately reconstructed by including Fourier coefficients only up to the 5th harmonic. In contrast, for PRBS2, there was still a clear pattern in the residuals at the 5th harmonic. The data were not adequately reconstructed until higher-frequency components up to the 28th harmonic were included. Evidence for this came from analysis of the mean square error. The mean square error at the 28th harmonic was reduced to 83 +/- 8% of the mean square error at the 5th harmonic for PRBS1 and to 31 +/- 3% for PRBS2 (P less than 0.0001). These data obtained by Fourier analysis and reconstructed for comparison with the original VO2 response indicate the presence of a high-frequency component that was not apparent when a test with a smaller bandwidth was used as the work rate forcing.\r"

  ".W": "We automated the inert gas rebreathe technique for measurement of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during heavy exercise. We also assessed the use of two gas tracers (He and N2) vs. a single gas tracer (He) for measurement of this lung volume and compared the two-tracer EELV to changes in the inspiratory capacity (defined with transpulmonary pressure) and shifts in the end-expiratory pressure from rest through heavy exercise. A computer program switched a pneumatic valve when flow crossed zero at end expiration and defined points in the He and N2 traces for calculation of EELV. An inherent delay of the rebreathing valve (50 ms) caused virtually no error at rest and during light exercise and an error of 74 +/- 9 ml in the EELV at peak inspiratory flow rates of 4 l/s. The measurement of EELV by the two gas tracers was closely correlated to the single-gas tracer measurement (r = 0.97) but was consistently higher (120 +/- 10 ml) than when He was used alone. This difference was accentuated with increased work rates (2-5% error in the EELV, rest to heavy exercise) and as rebreathe time increased (2-7% error in the EELV with rebreathe times of 5-20 s for all work loads combined). The double-gas tracer measurement of EELV agreed quite well with the thoracic gas volume at rest (P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggest that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is important in normal endometrial function and that it may be involved in certain uterine dysfunctions. In this study, the ability of the purified E. coli-derived recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha) to regulate the production of PGE2 by the endometrial epithelium is investigated. PGE2 levels determined by the RIA consistently increase upon incubation of cultured glandular epithelial cells with rIL-1 alpha. A significant increase is obtained with 17 and 170 ng/L rIL-1 alpha. A maximal effect is obtained within 24 h of incubation with rIL-1 alpha. In the seven endometria evaluated, rIL-1 alpha increases PGE2 synthesis in all cases, but the maximal increase relative to the basal levels varies between 2- to 10-fold for a given preparation. Vibratome sections retaining the integrity of the endometrial tissue also show an increased PGE2 synthesis in response to rIL-1 alpha. rIL-1 alpha-stimulated PGE2 production is blocked by the addition of a neutralizing antibody to rIL-1 alpha. In addition, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, suppresses both rIL-1 alpha-induced and basal PGE2 synthesis. Experiments using radioiodinated rIL-1 alpha reveal that the membranes prepared from human endometrial epithelium possess high affinity receptors for IL-1, suggesting that IL-1 regulates PGE2 synthesis by binding to this receptor site. The expression of IL-1 receptors and the ability to modulate PGE2 production by IL-1 in endometrial epithelium suggest that IL-1 may play a significant role in human uterine function via modulation of PGE2 production.\r"

  ".U": "90203124\r", 
  ".W": "Transient hypercalciuria has been noted after high carbohydrate meals which is independent of dietary calcium and is probably due to impaired renal calcium reabsorption mediated by an increase in plasma insulin levels. Based on these observations, some investigators believe that long term intake of high carbohydrate diets may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis and possibly osteoporosis. Using a randomized cross-over design, we compared high carbohydrate diets (60% carbohydrate and 25% fat) with high fat diets (50% fat and 35% carbohydrate) for effects on metabolism of calcium and other minerals in eight normal subjects and eight euglycemic patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. All other dietary constituents, such as protein, fiber, fluid, minerals (including Ca, Mg, Na, K, and P), and caffeine intake, were kept constant. Despite higher daylong levels of plasma insulin on the high carbohydrate diets compared to the high fat diet in both normal and noninsulin-dependent diabetic subjects, no changes in daily urinary excretion of calcium or other constituents, associated with renal stone risk, were observed. Furthermore, there was no change in fractional intestinal 47Ca absorption. Although hypercalciuria may ensue transiently after high carbohydrate meals, we conclude that substitution of simple or complex carbohydrates for fats in an isocaloric manner for a longer duration does not result in significant urinary calcium loss, and therefore, high intakes of digestible carbohydrates may not increase the risk of nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis via this mechanism.\r"

Women at risk of developing the disease were identified in early pregnancy by the presence of moderate or high titers of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb). They were given no treatment (n = 20), 0.1 mg L-T4 daily (n = 18), or 0.15 mg iodide daily (n = 20) for 40 weeks postpartum. Changes in thyroid function were seen in all women, although in nine hormone values remained within the reference ranges of erthymoid individuals. In each group of women, thyrotoxicosis occurred around 2-3 months postpartum, followed by a gradual rise of TPOAb. Subsequently, around 5-7 months postpartum, a hypothyroid phase was observed. TSH elevations (greater than 5 mU/L) occurred in 9 of 18 women in spite of treatment with 0.1 mg L-T4 although elevations were lower than in the other two groups. Among those women who developed abnormal thyroid function, the hormone changes appeared greater in the iodide-treated group than in the control group, suggesting that in certain patients iodide may aggravate rather than ameliorate the disease. All 58 women showed a reduction of TPOAb during pregnancy and a transient rise during the postpartum year. The extent of TPOAb elevations did not differ between the groups. Thus, the administration of L-T4 prevented hypothyroid symptoms, but did not alter the course of the postpartum thyroiditis, which appears not to be accelerated by events of target cell origin.\r"

Serum inhibin levels (mean +/- SD, 377.8 +/- 212.1 U/L), declined rapidly after castration (15 min after, 233 +/- 171.4; 30 min, 224.6 +/- 156.6; 1 h, 181.5 +/- 95.9; 2 h, 174.3 +/- 69.4; 4 h, 122 +/- 6.4; 6 h, less than 120). High concentrations of inhibin were detected in testicular tissue (31,360 +/- 15,180 U/kg), and the levels in spermatic venous blood (3,178.3 +/- 1,386.8 U/L) were approximately 10 times greater than those in peripheral blood (385.5 +/- 233.1 U/L). Testosterone levels were 1,968.2 +/- 992.3 nmol/kg in testicular tissue and approximately 100 times greater in spermatic venous blood (1,631.6 +/- 389.7 nmol/L) than in peripheral blood (18.0 +/- 4.4 nmol/L). These results suggest that circulating inhibin in men mainly originates from testis and that one of the routes of secretion is via the bloodstream.\r"

Analysis was performed by gas-liquid chromatography of the acetoxy methyl esters of the bile acids prepared after alkaline hydrolysis of the bile salts. An internal standard served to correct for methodological losses. Low levels of bile acids were found in serum samples, precluding overt hepatobiliary complications. Deoxycholic acid (17-160 mumol/L), chenodeoxycholic acid (18-305 mumol/L), and cholic acid (3-119 mumol/L) were detected in 11 of 12 samples of BCF. In 2 cases, chosen at random, the identities of the bile acids were verified by mass spectrometry. Lithocholic acid (9-23 mumol/L), a reported cocarcinogen, was detected in 6 of the 12 samples of BCF. This is the first report of the presence of lithocholic acid in BCF with confirmation by Mass spectrometry. There was no correlation between the levels of individual bile acids and those of potassium ion, Na+/K+, estriol-3-sulfate, or 16 alpha-hydroxyandrogen sulfates that had been quantified previously in these samples. There was borderline correlation between concentrations of total bile acids and K+ (P less than 0.06) and Na+/K+ (P less than 0.07). Yet to be elucidated are the mechanism of accumulation of bile acids in BCF and whether levels of particular bile acids in BCF may serve to identify that small subset of women with fibrocystic disease at risk for developing breast cancer.\r"

The ability of this drug to inhibit the extrarenal production of 1,25-(OH)2D, as occurs in human granuloma-forming disease states, including sarcoidosis, has not been evaluated. We examined the effect of ketoconazole on the 1,25-(OH)2D-calcium homeostatic mechanism in a hypercalcemic patient with sarcoidosis and on the synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vitro by cultured pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) from this and another host. Oral ketoconazole therapy (800 mg/day) decreased the serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentration 73% within 4 days; this was associated with a 15% decrease in the serum calcium concentration and a 57% decrease in the fractional urinary calcium excretion rate. In vitro, ketoconazole had a rapid onset, concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on sarcoid PAM 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis (ED50 = 0.1 mumol/L) that was not reversible by exposure to leukotriene C4, a potent stimulator of PAM 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis. Kinetic analysis of ketoconazole's action on the macrophage 1 alpha-hydroxylation reaction was examined at concentrations achieved in vivo when the drug is given orally. The velocity of the 1 alpha-hydroxylation reaction at ketoconazole concentrations of 0.01-1.0 mumol/L increased as the concentration of substrate 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 increased from 12-2000 nmol/L.\r"

Systemic and renal hemodynamics, hematocrit, plasma protein concentrations, plasma ACTH, arginine vasopressin, PRL, and catecholamines were unchanged. Porcine BNP has a similar range of effects and is similarly metabolized in man as human ANP. Further elucidation of the possible role of BNP as a circulating hormone in man awaits measurement of tissue and plasma concentrations of human BNP in health and disease and provision of fuller dose-response data for human as well as porcine BNP.\r"

Serum dialyzable calcium and urinary hydroxyproline excretion were higher in the postmenopausal women at baseline and throughout the low calcium diet. Baseline calcitriol levels were significantly lower in the postmenopausal women, but these were associated with lower vitamin D-binding protein levels; the calculated free calcitriol index was not different between the two groups. After the low calcium diet calcitriol levels rose in both groups to similar levels. PTH levels were not different in the two groups at baseline and rose to the same level on the low calcium diet. These data indicate that estrogen deficiency at the menopause is not associated with deficient calcitriol or PTH reserve, although basal calcitriol levels may be reduced secondarily due to lower vitamin D-binding protein levels or relative hypercalcaemia.\r"

Daily treatments were either conjugated equine estrogen, i.e. Premarin (P; 0.625 mg), Premarin and medroxyprogesterone acetate, i.e. Provera (PP; 0.625 and 5 mg, respectively), Premarin and methyltestosterone (PT; 0.625 and 5 mg, respectively), or placebo (PL). Compared to placebo, hormone treatment had significantly reduced hot flashes in the P and PP groups by week 4 and in the PT group by week 5. Headaches were reduced in the P vs. PL group, only. Hormone treatment did not significantly alter mood ratings, sexual behaviors, or psychophysiologically measured sexual arousal. PT treatment significantly increased reports of pleasure from masturbation compared to the other three groups, underscoring the apparent contribution of androgens to self-stimulatory behavior. However, the data suggest that in these physically and sexually healthy women, gonadal steroids do not influence major components of sexual functioning, including arousal and a wide variety of sexual activity and experience.\r"

Since plasma lecithin (L) was unchanged, the FC/L ratio declined significantly to levels observed in healthy menstruating women (pre-Rx, 95 +/- 0.16; post-Rx, 0.74 +/- 0.12 molar ratio; P less than 0.025). In low density lipoprotein (LDL), the concentrations of cholesterol and FC and the FC/L ratio all fell significantly (P less than 0.025, P less than 0.05, and P less than 0.025, respectively). Despite a tendency for high density lipoprotein2 cholesterol (HDL2-C) to increase (pre-Rx, 9.7 +/- 3.6; post-Rx, and 14.4 +/- 13.3 mg/dL; P less than 0.4) and phosphoinositol to fall, there were few clear-cut alterations in either HDL2 or HDL3 surface or core lipid composition. The combination of reduced HDL3 lysolecithin (P less than 0.025) associated with a posttreatment trend toward increased triglyceride/cholesterol esters ratios in both HDL subfractions are findings consistent with tamoxifen-induced inhibition of hepatic lipase. These changes in lipoprotein composition together with the fall in LDL cholesterol and increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (P less than 0.005) indicate that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist on the liver. Since elevated LDL cholesterol levels and qualitatively altered lipoproteins enriched in FC are both associated with increased coronary risk, the improvement noted in these parameters after tamoxifen should allay to some degree anxiety about its use with regard to cardiovascular risk.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated the presence of two classes of neurohypophysial hormone receptors in the vagina, myometrium, and oviduct of rabbit: an oxytocin (OT) site and a V1 arginine vasopressin (AVP) site. We now report binding and in vitro contractility studies on human myometrial specimens obtained at cesarean section from women at the end of pregnancy. The program Ligand was used to analyze self- and cross-displacement curves for labeled OT, AVP or its V1 antagonist d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP, the corresponding unlabeled peptides, and selective analogs. Our results clearly indicate the presence of heterogeneity of binding sites in human uterus. Blocking experiments were performed to evaluate the density of OT and V1 AVP receptors in individual uterine specimens. The contractile response of the same samples to OT, AVP, and analogs was also evaluated. Our results indicate that V1 AVP receptors are present in all of the uterine specimens investigated, with virtually equal density from 32 weeks to term. AVP and the V1-selective agonist [Phe2,Ile3,Orn8]VP stimulate contractility of uterine strips, an effect blocked by nanomolar concentration of the V1 antagonist d(CH2)5TyrMeAVP. Uterine OT receptors increase during late pregnancy, peaking in early labor. A significant correlation between the density of OT receptors and the frequency of uterine contractions (external tocography) was found in pregnant women before surgery. OT stimulated in vitro contractility of uterine strips only when the density of receptors was more than 150 fmol/mg protein. In conclusion, we identified biologically active V1 AVP receptors in human uterus at the end of gestation and confirmed the primary relevance of OT receptors in human parturition.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance is an early predictor of development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in Pima Indians, a population with the highest reported prevalence of NIDDM. The insulin receptor plays a central role in mediating insulin action, and previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the insulin receptor gene may cause insulin resistance. Therefore, we have cloned the insulin receptor cDNA from an insulin-resistant Pima Indian to determine if there is a mutation in the patient's insulin receptor gene. We obtained nine cDNA clones spanning exons 4-10 and 12-22 of the patient's insulin receptor gene. Polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequences for codons 523 (Ala), 1058 (His), and 1062 (Leu) provided useful markers to differentiate the patient's two alleles of the insulin receptor gene. These substitutions were silent, in that they did not alter the predicted amino acid sequence. The sequence of exons 1-3 and 11 was determined directly from genomic DNA that had been amplified using the polymerase chain reaction catalyzed by Taq DNA polymerase. Other investigators have reported defects in insulin binding and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in diabetic Pima Indians. However, we did not detect any mutations in this patient's insulin receptor gene. Thus, these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the defects in insulin receptor function are acquired rather than derived from defects in the primary structure of the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The family of cytochrome P450 enzymes that mediates steroid hydroxylations are distinct but structurally related proteins. Inhibitors of these steroidogenic steps generally exhibit only relative and dose-related specificity. We evaluated an imidazole, cytochrome P450-related inhibitor, CGS 16949A, in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer. While a relatively specific aromatase inhibitor at daily dosages of 1-2 mg, CGS 16949A significantly blunted cortisol responses to ACTH at a dose of 16 mg daily. To further evaluate other inhibitory effects of this drug, we determined blood levels of aldosterone (ALDO) and 18-hydroxycorticosterone and their respective urinary metabolites, tetrahydroaldosterone and tetrahydro-18-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone in 16 postmenopausal women receiving CGS 16949A. At a dose of 16 mg/day, CGS 16949A produced significant (P less than 0.001) suppression of both basal and ACTH-stimulated ALDO production. This was accompanied by a significant rise in the blood 18-hydroxycorticosterone/ALDO ratio (11.4 +/- 0.19; normal, less than 2; P less than 0.001), consistent with a corticosterone methyloxidase type II inhibition. A similar significant elevation (7.5 +/- 1.2; normal, less than 5; P less than 0.001) in the urinary tetrahydro-18-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone/tetrahydroaldosterone ratio was also observed. These results suggest that CGS 16949A is a potent inhibitor of the corticosterone methyloxidase type II enzyme at a dose of 16 mg daily. At doses of 1-2 mg daily, CGS 16949A blocks aromatase without altering basal aldosterone production and, thus, exhibits dose-related specificity.\r"

  ".W": "Primarily by increasing the availability of lipid intermediates, GH is likely to have profound effects on substrate consumption rates. To examine the short term actions of GH on glucose turnover, fuel oxidation and regional forearm metabolism, six normal volunteers were each studied twice for 5.5 h after having received a 4-h infusion of GH (20 ng/kg.min) or saline. GH induced slightly falling plasma glucose levels, acute 40-50% decreases in forearm glucose uptake, and no change in glucose turnover. Furthermore, substantial increases in circulating concentrations and forearm uptake of nonesterified fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate were recorded. Although GH infusion was followed by a 50% reduction of forearm alanine release hepatic nitrogen excretion seemed unaffected. Energy expenditure was not influenced by GH, but the non-protein respiratory exchange ratio decreased from a basal value of 0.778 +/- 0.008 to 0.732 +/- 0.007 after GH treatment (P less than 0.05). Correspondingly, lipid oxidation increased from 1.20 +/- 0.06 to 1.48 +/- 0.09 mg/kg.min, and glucose oxidation decreased from 0.97 +/- 0.12 to 0.39 +/- 0.06 mg/kg.min (P less than 0.05). Nonoxidative glucose utilization tended to increase. These data indicate that GH, by promoting lipid utilization and decreasing glucose oxidation, diminishes the need for gluconeogenesis and, therefore, could be protein preserving in the long term. Overall, we found no evidence of GH having acute insulin-like effects on glucose metabolism. GH appears to increase glucose storage, leaving total energy expenditure unaffected.\r"

  ".U": "90203152\r", 
  ".W": "In vitro studies with cytotrophoblasts obtained from term placentas have shown low levels of placental protein hormone secretion during the first 2 days in culture, followed by a marked increase during days 3 and 4. Since maternal serum placental hormone levels at term and during the first trimester differ, it is conceivable that cytotrophoblasts from first trimester placentas will differ in endocrine function from those derived from term placentas. Therefore, we examined the secretion of hCG, hCG alpha, human placental lactogen (hPL), and progesterone (P) both in the basal state and after exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP or endogenous cAMP stimulation with cholera toxin in cytotrophoblasts purified by enzymatic dispersion and Percoll gradient centrifugation from four first trimester and four third trimester placentas. At the time of seeding, all cells were mononuclear, and the degrees of aggregation and syncytia formation were similar in first and third trimester trophoblasts during the 4 days in culture. First trimester trophoblasts secreted greater quantities of hCG than did term trophoblasts, while basal secretion of hCG alpha, hPL, and progesterone were similar. Qualitative differences in the hormone secretory patterns were apparent. hCG secretion by first trimester trophoblasts decreased over the 4 days in culture, while the amounts secreted by third trimester trophoblasts increased. hCG alpha levels increased for 2-3 days in first trimester trophoblasts and then decreased, while hCG alpha increased in term trophoblast medium over the 4 days. The ratio of hCG alpha to hCG in media from first and third trimester cultures reflected the relative ratios of these hormones in placental tissue and maternal serum at analogous stages of pregnancy. hPL concentrations in the medium declined between days 3-4 in first trimester cultures, while they increased between days 3-4 in third trimester cultures. The secretory pattern of P was somewhat more erratic. cAMP stimulation led to a similar rise in hCG, hCG alpha, and P secretion in first and third trimester trophoblasts, and a variable response for hPL secretion. These results indicate that the functional activity of placental trophoblasts in culture depends in part upon the age of the placenta from which the cells are derived. The differences may represent intrinsic differences in function or the presence of inhibitory or stimulatory factors of maternal, fetal, or trophoblast origin.\r"

The extent of vascular and osteophytic calcification was graded from lateral lumbar radiographs. Fifty-five (43%) of the subjects had identifiable osteophytes, and 86 (67%) had vascular calcifications. Despite similar ages and weights in subjects with and without ostephytes, those with osteophytes had greater spinal density (1.34 vs. 1.17 g/cm2; P less than 0.001), and there was a strong correlation between osteophyte severity and spinal density (r = 0.41; P less than 0.00001). Proximal femoral density was not different in those with and without osteophytes. The distribution of osteophytes in this population was not random, and as a result, the presence of osteophytes obscured the the relationship of bone density to age as well as the comparison of hospitalized to normal men. Vascular calcification had a minimal effect on vertebral density. In summary, osteophytic calcification exerted an important influence on the measurement of spinal bone density in men. This effect should be considered in both clinical and research applications of integral vertebral density measures.\r"

Furthermore, varying degrees of alpha inhibin immunoactivity were demonstrated in serum from normal subjects and patients with various reproductive disorders by both Western blot and RIA. These results demonstrate that data obtained using this RIA should be interpreted with caution as to the degree to which they reflect the presence of intact dimeric inhibin vs. alpha inhibin proteins in the circulation.\r"

To examine the effect of degly-hCG on the lifespan and steroidogenic activity of the primate corpus luteum, the antagonist was administered to female rhesus monkeys (n = 7) beginning at the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In a control cycle the saline vehicle was infused via an osmotic minipump directly into the corpus luteum. In a subsequent cycle, one of three dose rates of degly-hCG (0.001, 0.009, and 0.09 nmol/h) was infused into the corpus luteum. Pump implantation and infusion began 5-9 days after the midcycle LH surge and continued for 7 days. Peripheral venous blood was collected daily from day 8 of the cycle until menses, and serum progesterone levels were determined by RIA. Progesterone levels and patterns were similar in animals that received either the saline vehicle or degly-hCG, and the length of the luteal phase in monkeys receiving any dose of degly-hCG (16.4 +/- 0.5 days) was not different from that in animals receiving a control infusion (16.1 +/- 0.9 days). In a corollary study, an intraluteal infusion of degly-hCG (0.009 nmol/h) in the midluteal phase did not prevent stimulation of progesterone levels after im injection of hCG (15 IU/day for 5 days). We conclude that whereas degly-hCG is a useful tool to examine gonadotropin action in vitro, it is not a potent gonadotropin antagonist in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Hypersecretion of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit has been reported in pituitary adenomas, particularly in clinically nonfunctioning tumors and somatotroph adenomas. However, the prevalence of such hypersecretion has not been precisely defined. Using both a new highly sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody assay and a polyclonal antibody assay, serum levels of free alpha-subunit were compared in 63 unselected patients with these tumors, 19 patients with acromegaly, and 95 normal controls. In all patients the monoclonal assay detected a significantly greater number of subjects with elevated alpha-subunit levels than did the polyclonal assay (21 vs. 14; P less than 0.01). Fourteen of the 63 patients with clinically nonfunctioning tumors (22%) had elevated serum alpha-subunit levels in the monoclonal assay vs. 11 (17%) in the polyclonal assay. Among the 19 patients with acromegaly, the prevalence was 7 (37%) and 3 (16%) using the monoclonal and polyclonal assays, respectively. Twenty-eight (44%) of the patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas were female. Eleven (39%) of the women were under 45 yr old, as were 10 (29%) of the men. We conclude that the prevalence of free alpha-subunit hypersecretion in patients with clinically nonfunctioning and somatotroph adenomas may be higher than previously recognized, and that a sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody free alpha-subunit assay may provide a useful tumor marker in these patients. The prevalence of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary tumors among younger men and women may also have been previously under-estimated.\r"

  ".U": "90203168\r", 
  ".W": "Models for the structure of the GH-dependent 150K insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP) complex include 1) a binding subunit of 40-60K mol wt associated with a larger nonbinding component, and 2) an oligomeric structure simply made up of six 25-28K monomeric IGF-BP complexes. To evaluate these alternative models we examined the IGF-binding characteristics and behavior on an SP-Sephadex ion exchange column of BP species identified by chemically cross-linking [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II. In addition, human serum was gel filtered on Sephadex G-200 in 0.05 M NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and the 150K BP identified by binding of [125I]IGF-II to column fractions. When [125I]IGF-I or [125I]IGF-II was cross-linked to the 150K BP with disuccinimidyl suberate and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10-15%) and autoradiography, four specifically labeled complexes of 20K, 24K, 33K, and 47K mol wt were identified. We examined the IGF-binding characteristics of these species by cross-linking [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II after incubation in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II. Formation of the 24K complex was inhibited more potently by IGF-II than IGF-I, whereas the relative potency of IGF-I vs. IGF-II for inhibition of the formation of the other complexes depended upon whether [125I]IGF-II or [125I]IGF-I was used. When the 150K BP complex generated from gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 was acid stripped, the only species seen with chemical cross-linking of either [125I]IGF-I or [125I]IGF-II was the 47K complex. By both conventional competitive binding studies and cross-linking [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II after incubation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II, the formation of the 47K complex was usually more potently inhibited by IGF-I than IGF-II. When Cohn fraction IV extract was chromatographed on a SP-Sephadex column (pH 3) and cross-linking performed on the flow-through, the 47K species was intensely labeled, and the 20K, 33K, and 24K complexes were weakly labeled or not seen at all. The 20K, 33K, and 24K complexes could be identified after cross-linking [125I]IGF-II to the pH 7 eluate from the ion exchange column, but the 47K complex was not seen. These data provide additional physical evidence for separate binding sites with different relative affinities for IGF-I and IGF-II within the 150K BP complex.\r"

Thirty-five apparently healthy caucasian schoolgirls were selected for Tanner's breast development stage M2; they had all been classified as being stage M1 6 months earlier. Body fat mass had no relationship with the total plasma sex steroid concentration or gonadotropins. However, body fat mass was correlated with the fraction of testosterone that was not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and considered the fraction available for biological activity. Body fat distribution, rather than body fat mass, was different in relation to the total concentrations of estrone, estradiol (E2), and testosterone as well as the percentage of available E2 or testosterone. Girls with fat localized predominantly on the hips had the highest levels of sex steroids and gonadotropins. It seems likely that this type of fat distribution is a result of ovarian activity. Girls with predominantly abdominal fat were also more obese and showed increased plasma levels of total E2 and a lower androgen/estrogen ratio in plasma, possibly due to increased aromatization, especially in abdominal adipose tissue. The findings suggest a reciprocal relationship among body fat distribution, plasma sex hormone levels, and availability of sex steroids in early female puberty.\r"

MCRs and conversion ratios were measured using concentrations of radioactivity in the blood pools of A and E1. Peripheral aromatization was measured from the concentrations of radioactivity in the E1 glucuronide pool in the urine. After the women were euthyroid, the MCR of A had increased in seven of eight, the MCR of E1 increased in all eight, and peripheral aromatization had decreased in seven of eight.

In the present study plasma CRH was measured in the plasma of five pregnant baboons and their fetuses to ascertain whether the baboon is a suitable model for study of placental CRH. Studies were performed in chronically catheterized animals that exhibited no behavioral or endocrinological signs of stress; maternal animals moved freely about the cage. Mean maternal plasma CRH was 620 +/- 110 pmol/L (2970 pg/mL) at 146 +/- 11 days gestation, and mean fetal plasma CRH was 133 +/- 29 pmol/L (640 pg/mL) at delivery in four animals. Plasma CRH was undetectable (less than 8.5 pmol/L; less than 41 pg/mL) in nonpregnant animals and in animals 8 h after delivery. Maternal and fetal plasma CRH levels in the chronically catheterized baboon were very similar to human maternal and umbilical cord CRH levels at comparable gestational ages. In addition, the majority of maternal plasma CRH eluted in the same position as synthetic human CRH by gel filtration. CRH stimulation tests were performed in the chronically catheterized maternal baboon to investigate whether pituitary-adrenal function during pregnancy is similar to that observed after chronic CRH infusion; blunted ACTH and cortisol responses to acute injections of CRH are observed after chronic CRH infusion. The administration of 0.5 micrograms/kg ovine CRH (oCRH) failed to result in an ACTH or cortisol rise in four pregnant baboons. Baseline ACTH levels were 5.2 +/- 0.4 pmol/L (23.5 pg/mL), and baseline cortisol levels were 800 +/- 55 nmol/L (29.1 micrograms/dL); neither rose after CRH administration. In contrast, 0.5 micrograms/kg oCRH did result in significant ACTH and cortisol elevations in five nonpregnant baboons [ACTH: baseline, 5.9 +/- 1.4; peak, 16 +/- 4.8 pmol/L (P less than 0.05); cortisol: baseline, 430 +/- 55 nmol/L; peak, 960 +/- 200 nmol/L (P less than 0.05)]. In contrast, the administration of a larger dose of oCRH (5.0 micrograms/kg) led to stimulation of ACTH release in five pregnant baboons (baseline, 6.6 +/- 1.3 pmol/L; peak, 34.1 +/- 6.4; P less than 0.001). After this dose cortisol levels also rose in the pregnant animals (baseline = 1040 +/- 30 nmol/L; peak, 1620 +/- 130); however, this response was blunted compared to that in the nonpregnant animals (P less than 0.05). CRH (5.0 micrograms/kg) significantly stimulated both ACTH and cortisol in the nonpregnant animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All patients had mild hypercalcemia in the absence of any other cause and elevated levels of PTH without radiological evidence of bone disease. Static parameters of bone turnover (osteoid surface, osteoid volume, and eroded surface) were elevated in both men and women compared to normal values; the midmolecule RIA for PTH (PTHMM) was positively correlated with osteoid surface (r = 0.44; P less than 0.025) and eroded surface (r = 0.58; P less than 0.005). Dynamic parameters of bone turnover (mineralizing surface, expressed as double plus half single labeled surface, and bone formation rate at tissue level) were elevated compared to normal values; PTHMM was positively correlated with double plus half single labeled surfaces (r = 0.33; P less than 0.05) and with bone formation rate at the tissue level (r = 0.37; P less than 0.05). The mineral apposition rate was within the limits of normal values and positively correlated with PTHMM (r = 0.34; P less than 0.05). Histomorphometric parameters of bone structure [cancellous bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and total bone density (TBD)] were compared to those in 20 autopsy control subjects, 12 men (33-60 yr old) and 8 women (27-75 yr old). BV/TV and Tb.N were significantly higher in PHPT patients than controls (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Tb.Sp was significantly lower in PHPT patients than controls (P less than 0.001), whereas Tb.Th was not significantly different between PHPT patients and controls. Ct.Th was significantly lower in PHPT patients than in controls (P less than 0.001), whereas TBD was not significantly different between the two groups. BV/TV was negatively correlated with age in both controls and PHPT patients. Tb.N showed a negative correlation and Tb.Sp a positive correlation with age in controls (r = -0.47; P less than 0.05 and r = 0.52; P less than 0.02, respectively), but they were not significantly dependent on age in PHPT patients.

Healing of the laparotomy wounds was assessed tensiometrically on the 6th and 14th postoperative days. Burned rats lost weight significantly and had significantly lower hemoglobin and serum albumin concentrations than control rats on both the 6th and 14th days. The peak forces applied to their musculo-fascial and skin wounds were significantly decreased on the 6th day only. The control somatropin group had significantly stronger musculo-fascial wounds than the control placebo group on the 6th day. Somatropin administration had no effect on burned rats. It is concluded that the limited anabolic activity of somatropin in rats with normal pituitary function is abolished by injury.\r"

Gonadotropin and alpha-subunit levels were negatively correlated with age, while PRL levels did not decrease with age. Regression means of serum concentrations in women aged 55 to 75 yr, respectively, decreased for LH from 47.1 to 32.4 IU/L, for FSH from 72.1 to 61.6 IU/L, and for alpha-subunit from 2.6 to 1.9 micrograms/L. The ratio of alpha-subunit to LH and FSH decreased with age. These changes may be caused by either a direct effect of aging on pituitary gonadotroph cells or an effect of aging on the hypothalamic regulation of these cells. Serum gonadotropin and alpha-subunit concentrations were negatively correlated with the BMI, but not with circulating estradiol levels. In addition, we found that estrone and estradiol levels were positively correlated with the BMI, while circulating levels of androstenedione and estrone were more important factors, determining estrone and estradiol levels, respectively. In conclusion, in contrast to what has been reported in normal aging men, serum LH, FSH, and alpha-subunit concentrations decrease with age in normal postmenopausal women.\r"

Using an assay for PTH that detects rapid changes in PTH secretion (N-terminal-specific RIA; normal range, less than 3-33 pg/mL), we determined PTH suppressibility in response to a standardized dose of oral calcium in normal subjects and patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Nine normal subjects were given oral calcium (25 mg/kg), and blood was analyzed half-hourly for 3 h for calcium and N-terminal PTH (N-PTH). Serum calcium rose by 0.34 +/- 0.06 mg/dL (0.085 +/- 0.015 mmol/L), and N-PTH levels declined rapidly from 15.3 +/- 1.4 to 4.2 +/- 1.1 pg/mL (-73 +/- 6%; P less than 0.01). In six subjects N-PTH concentrations became undetectable. Nine patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were tested in the same manner. Serum calcium rose by 0.53 +/- 0.1 mg/dL (0.13 +/- 0.025 mmol/L), and N-PTH levels declined less, from 66 +/- 14 to 52 +/- 12 pg/mL (-21 +/- 4%; P less than 0.05). In none of the patients was the PTH reduced to less than 20 pg/mL. These results illustrate in vivo that the PTH response to oral calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism is markedly different from that in normal subjects.\r"

The mean duration of the study and the mean total dosage were 1.6 months and 2.4 g in the daily period, respectively, and 4.7 months and 3.5 g in the intermittent period, respectively. Blood was drawn for 6 h after iv administration of 20 mg prednisolone (average, 0.36 mg/kg). Plasma total and free prednisolone concentrations were measured by RIA. On-day and off-day tests were performed during the same week. The mean MCR of both total and free prednisolone decreased significantly in the daily and on-day periods compared with the pretreatment values. The decreased MCR during the on-day period was restored to the pretreatment level during the off-day period. A similar trend was observed in the changes in half-life, prolongation in the daily and on-day periods compared with the pretreatment value, and restoration to the pretreatment level during the off-day period. These alterations were not associated with the total duration or the total dosage of prednisolone administered. The results indicate that the pharmacokinetic parameters of prednisolone may periodically change during the intermittent regimen, and that off-day and on-day parameters are similar to those before therapy and during the daily period, respectively.\r"

These changes are characterized by 1) increased pituitary release of TSH in response to iv TRH, 2) increased serum clearance of orally administered T3, and 3) normal serum total, free T4, and unstimulated TSH levels. To clarify the mechanism responsible for these findings, serum kinetic studies of 125I-labeled T4 and T3 were carried out in a group of normal men, first in California, then after 20 and 42 weeks of continuous Antarctic residence. The kinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. The mean T4 residence time (MRT) was not different before and after 42 weeks (5.54 +/- 0.50 and 5.08 +/- 0.43 days). The total T4 volume of distribution (TVd) tended to fall over the same period (4.30 +/- 0.12, 3.56 +/- 0.27 L/m2), but was not significantly different (P = 0.075). In contrast to T4, there was an increase from control values for the T3 MRT from 0.83 +/- 0.03 to 1.10 +/- 0.03 days (P less than 0.002) and a more than doubling of the T3 TVd from 15.55 +/- 0.52 to 47.24 +/- 5.09 L/m2 (P less than 0.002) after 42 wk of Antarctic residence. Energy intake increased approximately 40% throughout the study without a change in body weight. The changes in T3 kinetic parameters may be accounted for by increased extravascular tissue binding. The marked increase in T3 TVd and the small increase in MRT are associated with increased T3 production and clearance and only minor changes in T4 kinetics. This is the first description of a mechanism for the change in thyroid hormone economy occurring with extended residence in Antarctica.\r"

Media were changed each 24 h, and PP12, PP14, and PRL levels were determined by RIA. Decidual explants, as well as their isolated cells produced detectable levels of PP12, PP14, and PRL in vitro. The gland cells synthesized and secreted about 30 times more PP14 than did stromal cells. After 96-120 h of incubation, the production of each protein by control cultures was increased 81-167% compared to the baseline (not significant). The secretion of these proteins in medium supplemented with progesterone or hCG was not significantly different from that in the control groups. 8-Bromo-cAMP significantly increased the secretion of PRL and PP12, but not PP14, by stromal cells compared to control values. We conclude that 1) PP14 is mainly produced by decidual gland cells; 2) progesterone at the concentrations used in our study does not stimulate production of PP12, PP14, and PRL in decidualized endometrium in vitro; 3) hCG does not stimulate the production of PP12 and PP14 in decidualized endometrium; and 4) 8-bromo-cAMP stimulates decidual stromal cell secretion of PRL and PP12.\r"

The occurrence of E2 and P4 pulses is simultaneous, as their peaks were maximally correlated at zero time lag (P less than 10(-4], and there were comparable periodicities for E2 (13.5 +/- 0.7 pulses/24 h) and P4 (11.2 +/- 0.7 pulses/24 h). This coupling of E2 and P4 pulses suggests cosecretion by the mature corpus luteum. These E2 and P4 pulses are significantly coupled with LH pulses, with a lag time of about 30 min and/or 45 min for P4 (P = 0.029) and 0 min and/or 15 min for E2 (P = 0.032). Further, when considered together, LH, E2, and P4 are found to be triply copulsatile (P = 0.0066). However, significant numbers of discrete pulses of P4 and E2 are observed without antecedent LH pulses, suggesting some degree of corpus luteum autonomy. In conclusion, orchestrated synchrony of pulsatile pituitary and ovarian (corpus luteum) signaling can be demonstrated by the coordinated temporal release of LH, E2, and P4 in normal cycling women.\r"

Arginine vasopressin (AVP; 2.8 X 10(-10) M in the bath) reduced bicarbonate absorption by 50% (from 7.8 to 3.7 pmol/min per mm). AVP caused a similar reduction in bicarbonate absorption in tubules perfused with 10(-4) M furosemide to inhibit net NaCl absorption. Glucagon (2 X 10(-9) M in the bath) also reduced bicarbonate absorption (from 11.7 to 7.6 pmol/min per mm). The inhibition of bicarbonate absorption could be reproduced with either exogenous 8-bromo-cAMP or forskolin. With 8-bromo-cAMP (10(-3) M) in the bath, addition of vasopressin to the bath did not significantly affect bicarbonate absorption. PTH significantly inhibited bicarbonate absorption, but the extent of inhibition was less than that observed with either AVP or glucagon. Vasopressin had no effect on net ammonium absorption in MTAL perfused and bathed with 4 mM NH4Cl. These findings indicate that: (a) vasopressin, glucagon, and PTH directly inhibit bicarbonate absorption in the MTAL of the rat; (b) this inhibition occurs independent of effects on net NaCl absorption and appears to be mediated in part by cAMP; and (c) HCO3- and NH4+ absorption can be regulated independently in the MTAL.\r"

In selected populations such as the Afrikaners in South Africa, the Christian Lebanese, and the French Canadians, the disease is more frequent due to the founder effect. Previous studies demonstrated that a single mutation at the LDL receptor locus, the so-called French Canadian deletion, makes up 60% of the mutant genes responsible for FH in the French Canadian population. In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as well as two deletions. LDL receptor mutations were detected in 76% of individuals and 14% had one of the three missense mutations.\r"

These complexes have been used to treat Dpt-hypersensitive patients who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Clinical symptoms and medication intake were followed by filling in diary cards. Peak expiratory flow, measured four times a day, was also followed. Intradermal skin tests and bronchial challenge tests were performed with allergen together with an evaluation of nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Specific IgE and IgG antibodies were assayed after separation from the bulk of serum immunoglobulins by immunoadsorption. The study was carried out over two years according to a double-blind protocol. Intradermal inoculation of antigen-antibody complexes resulted in a marked reduction of both clinical and medication scores. No systemic side-effects were observed and only mild wheal and flare reactions were noted at the injection site. The treatment showed a drastic reduction of specific skin and bronchial reactivities with only marginal effects on nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Concentrations of specific IgE antibodies decreased significantly during the first weeks of treatment and remained at these lower values throughout the study. Specific IgG antibodies actually decreased in the majority of treated patients. The total amount of allergen used in this study was less than 1% of the amount currently used for conventional hyposensitization with the same allergen. These findings show that antigen-antibody complex inoculation is an efficient and safe means of treating allergic bronchial asthma and that the mechanism of action is likely to differ from conventional hyposensitization.\r"

In adult HA/ICR mice pretreated with ferric chloride, the LD50 for S-plus strain 84-32 was 43.3 times lower than its spontaneous S-minus mutant 84-54. Seven strains of inbred mice were no more susceptible than the outbred strain. In contrast to the findings with Salmonella typhimurium by others, 3 X 10(7) CFU of strain 84-32 caused 90% mortality in C3H/HeN (LPSn) mice and 40% mortality in C3H/HeJ (LPSd) mice. High-grade bacteremia in HA/ICR mice occurred after oral challenge with S-plus C. fetus strains and continued for at least 2 d, but was not present in any mice challenged with S-minus strains. Bacteremia at 30 min after challenge was 51.6-fold lower in mice pretreated with 10 microliters of rabbit antiserum to purified S-protein than after pretreatment with normal rabbit serum. Challenge of mice with a mixture of S-minus strain 84-54 and free S-proteins at a concentration 31.1-fold higher than found in wild-type strain 84-32 caused 30% mortality, compared with 0% with strain 84-54 or S-protein alone. These findings in a mouse model point toward the central role of the S-protein in the pathogenesis of C. fetus infection. The S-protein is not toxic per se, but enhances virulence when present on the bacterial cell surface as a capsule.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibility to develop seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been linked to specific genomic polymorphisms within the HLA complex. Two different haplotypes have been associated with the disease, HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4. To investigate the link between such phenotypic disease associations and potential immune mechanisms we used alloreactive and antigen-specific human T cell clones. Here we describe a panel of alloreactive T cell clones directed to polymorphic determinants encoded by the third hypervariable region (hvr) of the HLA-DR beta 1-chain. T cell determinants defined by these clones are shared among HLA-DR1, HLA-Dw4, HLA-Dw13, HLA-Dw14, and HLA-Dw15, and are frequent in a population of RA patients. To study the role of such disease-associated epitopes in antigen-restricted T cell recognition we generated T cell clones from RA patients specific for mycobacterial antigens, Epstein-Barr virus antigens, and tetanus toxoid. In all three antigenic systems T cell clones were restricted to either HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR4. These data suggest that the polymorphisms within the first and second hvr of the HLA-DR beta 1-chain that are distinct in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 and not associated with the disease are crucially involved in the recognition of antigens. Polymorphic determinants encoded by the third hvr are shared among disease-associated haplotypes and may function to mediate the interaction of alloreactive T cell receptor molecules with the HLA complex.\r"

In the Northern blot analysis of normal human liver and fibroblast poly(A)+ RNA, three mRNA species of different sizes (4.6, 3.8, and 2.1 kb) hybridized to IVD cDNA.

However, proteins that serve as effectors of these responses have not been well characterized. To identify proteins that might serve as mediators of the effects of Ca2+ in human neutrophils, we isolated proteins that bind to membrane phospholipids in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner. The most abundant of these, a protein of 33 kD, was readily purified to homogeneity, and was found to bind to phosphatidylserine vesicles in the presence of 2 microM ionized Ca2+. In addition, this purified protein promoted Ca2(+)-dependent aggregation of isolated specific granules from human neutrophils, indicating that it might mediate membrane-membrane contact during processes such as phagosome-lysosome fusion or degranulation. This protein was localized to the cytoplasm of unstimulated neutrophils and found to account for approximately 1% of the cytosol protein. Amino acid sequence of several peptides derived from the purified protein revealed that it is identical to lipocortin III, a recently described member of the annexin family that is scarce in other cells and tissues. The abundance of this protein, together with its Ca2(+)-dependent membrane effects, suggest that it mediates membrane-localized events in stimulated neutrophils, such as phagosome-lysosome fusion or degranulation.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells with nanomolar tumor-promoting phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) diesters results in the synchronous acquisition of multiple markers of the megakaryocyte phenotype. Induced cells markedly increase their content of cytoplasm and show features of morphological maturation. At the ultrastructural level, PMA-treated cells show increases in cytoplasm, nuclear lobulation and nucleolar content, and free ribosomes. Limited numbers of cells also express alpha-granules and nascent demarcation membrane systems. Functionally, PMA-stimulated HEL cells express increased amounts of the megakaryocyte/platelet proteins: glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, platelet factor 4, von Willebrand factor, glycoprotein Ib, and thrombospondin. No changes are observed in antigenic markers of the erythroid (glycophorin A) or macrophage lineages (MO-1 or MO-2). The increases in antigenic expression are rapid, reaching maximum levels within 3-4 d under serum-free conditions. Treatment with PMA also abruptly (within 1-2 d) inhibits cellular division in these cells. Washout studies indicate that phorbols exert their effect within 18-24 h, the approximate cell cycle time for these cells. Consistent with proliferative arrest, c-myc proto-oncogene transcripts begin to decline within 8 h of PMA treatment, although transcripts of c-myb are unaffected. Importantly, megakaryocyte differentiation is associated with endomitotic DNA synthesis (i.e., continued DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis and cytokinesis), with HEL cells reaching a DNA content of 3-12 times that of unstimulated cells. Endomitosis is coordinately regulated with changes in antigenic expression and cell size such that those cells having the highest DNA content are the largest and also express the greatest levels of antigen.\r"

Skin has been shown to contain relatively high amounts of NGF, which is in keeping with the finding that the quantity of NGF in a tissue is proportional to the extent of sympathetic innervation of that organ. Since the keratinocyte, a major cellular constituent of the skin, is known to produce other growth factors and cytokines, our experiments were designed to determine whether keratinocytes are a source of NGF. Keratinocyte-conditioned media from the keratinocyte cell line PAM 212 contained NGF-like activity, approximately 2-3 ng/ml, as detected by the neurite outgrowth assay. Freshly isolated BALB/c keratinocytes contained approximately 0.1 ng/ml. Using a cDNA probe directed against NGF, we demonstrated the presence of a 1.3-kb NGF mRNA in both PAM 212 and BALB/c keratinocytes. Since ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a potentially important modulating factor for cytokines in skin, we examined the effect of UV on NGF mRNA expression. Although UV initially inhibited the expression of keratinocyte NGF mRNA (4 h), by 24 h an induction of NGF mRNA was seen. The NGF signal could also be induced by phorbol esters. Thus, keratinocytes synthesize and express NGF, and its expression is modulated by UVB and phorbol esters.\r"

An atmosphere with PO2 approximately 14 mm Hg was not lethally toxic to endothelial cultures, but cells became larger and exhibited small intercellular gaps. At low oxygen concentrations, passage of macromolecular tracers through hypoxic endothelial monolayers was accelerated in a time- and dose-dependent manner, presumably by a paracellular pathway via the gaps. Cell surface coagulant properties of the endothelium were also perturbed. At PO2 approximately 14 mm Hg thrombomodulin antigen and functional activity on the cell surface were diminished by 80-90%, and Northern blots demonstrated suppression of thrombomodulin mRNA. The decrease in thrombomodulin was twice as great compared with the general decline in total protein synthesis in hypoxia. In addition, expression of a direct Factor X activator developed under hypoxic conditions; the activator was membrane-associated and expressed on the surface of intact cultures, Ca-dependent, inhibited by HgCl2 but not PMSF, and had Km approximately 25 micrograms/ml for the substrate at pH 7.4. Synthesis of the activator was blocked by inclusion of cycloheximide, but not warfarin, in the culture medium. These results demonstrate that endothelial function is perturbed in a selective manner in the presence of low concentrations of oxygen, providing insights into mechanisms which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in hypoxemic states.\r"

We isolated enriched fractions of villus tip, mid-villus, and crypt enterocytes from which microvillus membrane vesicles were prepared. Using this material we characterized the alterations that occur in microvillus membrane fluidity as the rabbit enterocyte matures and correlated these with kinetic studies of glucose transport. With increasing maturity the microvillus membrane becomes more rigid due to both an increase in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and alterations in individual phospholipid subclasses. Maximal rates of glucose transport were greatest in microvillus membrane vesicles prepared from mature cells. However, the glucose concentration producing half-maximal rates of transport (Km) was significantly lower in crypt microvillus membrane vesicles, suggesting that a distinct glucose transporter existed in crypt enterocytes. This distinction disappeared when differences between membrane lipid environments were removed. By fluidizing villus-tip microvillus membrane vesicles, in vitro, to levels seen in the crypt microvillus membrane, we observed a reduction in the Km of this transport system. These data suggest that the kinetic characteristics of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter are dependent upon its local membrane environment.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial sepsis often precedes the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bacterial endotoxin (LPS) produces a syndrome similar to ARDS when infused into experimental animals. We determined in isolated, buffer-perfused rabbit lungs, free of plasma and circulating blood cells that LPS synergized with platelet activating factor (PAF) to injure the lung. In lungs perfused for 2 h with LPS-free buffer (less than 100 pg/ml), stimulation with 1, 10, or 100 nM PAF produced transient pulmonary hypertension and minimal edema. Lungs perfused for 2 h with buffer containing 100 ng/ml of Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS had slight elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and did not develop edema. In contrast, lungs exposed to 100 ng/ml of LPS for 2 h had marked increases in PAP and developed significant edema when stimulated with PAF. LPS treatment increased capillary filtration coefficient, suggesting that capillary leak contributed to pulmonary edema. LPS-primed, PAF-stimulated lungs had enhanced production of thromboxane B2 (TXB) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPF). Indomethacin completely inhibited PAF-stimulated production of TXB and 6KPF in control and LPS-primed preparations, did not inhibit the rise in PAP produced by PAF in control lungs, but blocked the exaggerated rise in PAP and edema seen in LPS-primed, PAF-stimulated lungs. The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor dazoxiben, and the thromboxane receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548, similarly inhibited LPS-primed pulmonary hypertension and edema after PAF-stimulation. These studies indicate that LPS primes the lung for enhanced injury in response to the physiologic mediator PAF by amplifying the synthesis and release of thromboxane in lung tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Occupancy of specific receptors on neutrophils by adenosine or its analogues diminishes the stimulated release of toxic oxygen metabolites from neutrophils, while paradoxically promoting chemotaxis. We now report evidence that two distinct adenosine receptors are found on neutrophils (presumably the A1 and A2 receptors of other cell types). These adenosine receptors modulate chemotaxis and O2- generation, respectively. N6-Cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a selective A1 agonist, promoted neutrophil chemotaxis to the chemoattractant FMLP as well as or better than 5'N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA). In contrast, CPA did not inhibit O2- generation stimulated by FMLP. Pertussis toxin completely abolished promotion of chemotaxis by CPA but enhanced inhibition by NECA of O2- generation. Disruption of microtubules by colchicine or vinblastine also abrogated the enhancement by NECA of chemotaxis whereas these agents did not markedly interfere with inhibition by NECA of O2- generation. FMLP receptors, once they have bound ligand, shift to a high affinity state and become associated with the cytoskeleton. NECA significantly increased association of [3H]FMLP with cytoskeletal preparations as it inhibited O2-. Disruption of microtubules did not prevent NECA from increasing association of [3H]FMLP with cytoskeletal preparations. Additionally, CPA (A1 agonist) did not increase binding of [3H]FMLP to the cytoskeleton as well as NECA (A2 agonist). These studies indicate that occupancy of one class of adenosine receptors (A1) promotes chemotaxis by a mechanism requiring intact microtubules and G proteins whereas engagement of a second class of receptors (A2) inhibits O2- generation. Signalling via A2 receptors is independent of microtubules, insensitive to pertussis toxin and is associated with binding of [3H]FMLP to cytoskeletal preparations.\r"

  ".W": "Using idiotypic analysis, we examined the variable (V) region diversity of human antibodies specific for the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib PS). A goat anti-idiotypic serum (anti-Id) was prepared against anti-Hib PS antibodies isolated from the serum of an adult immunized with Hib PS. The anti-Id bound donor anti-Hib PS antibodies and inhibited Hib PS binding of donor anti-Hib PS. In contrast, the anti-Id did not bind donor or pooled Ig depleted of Hib PS antibodies, nor did it inhibit antigen binding of human antibodies to pneumococcal PS's, meningococcal A PS or diphtheria toxoid. Crossreactive idiotype (CRI), as measured by anti-Id inhibition of Hib PS binding, was found in 74 of 98 subjects (76%) vaccinated with Hib PS at 1.7-57 yr of age. 60 of these 74 subjects had greater than 50% of their serum Hib PS-binding activity inhibited by anti-Id. No correlation was found between age and CRI expression. In subjects showing both IgG1 and IgG2 antibody responses, CRI was most frequently detected in both subclasses (71% of subjects). CRI was limited to either IgG1 or IgG2 in 19% of subjects, a finding suggestive of independent B cell lineages. 13 of 15 infants less than 17 mo of age, who responded to Hib PS-outer membrane protein conjugate vaccine, had greater than 50% of their serum anti-Hib PS antibody activity inhibited by anti-Id. The ability of native Hib PS and Hib PS oligomer to partially inhibit (60 and 35%, respectively) the binding between anti-Id and heterologous anti-Hib PS, indicated that some CRI determinants are in or near the combining site. In summary, our findings demonstrate a highly penetrant and frequently predominant CRI, which is expressed in both infants and adults. The results underscore the limited V region diversity of anti-Hib PS antibodies and indicate that CRI predominance is manifest early in ontogeny and is induced by both TI and TD forms of the Hib PS antigen.\r"

When incubated for 1 h with normal fibroblasts, reverse phase HPLC indicated that 24% of the 12-HETE radioactivity was converted to one major polar metabolite. Chemical derivatization followed by reverse phase HPLC and TLC indicated that this metabolite is 8-hydroxyhexadecatrienoic acid [16:3(8-OH)]. Similarly, 33% of the added 15-HETE was also converted to a more polar metabolite. Neither 12- nor 15-HETE were converted to any metabolites by the peroxisomal deficient (Zellweger) cells. No defect in HETE oxidation was found in other human fibroblast cell lines with diverse metabolic abnormalities. Zellweger fibroblasts accumulated increased amounts of 12-HETE, compared with normal fibroblasts. As in the normal cells, most of the 12-HETE incorporated into Zellweger fibroblasts was present in the choline and ethanolamine phosphoglycerides. Protein synthesis, lysosomal acid lipase activity, and mitochondrial butyrate oxidation were not impaired in the Zellweger fibroblasts. Since the Zellweger cells do not convert 12- and 15-HETE to oxidative metabolites, peroxisomes appear to be the cellular organelle responsible for HETE oxidation.\r"

Although the polypeptide and RNA components of the Ro RNPs have been characterized, much less is known about the native structure of these particles. We have now characterized by biochemical techniques intact Ro ribonucleoprotein particles from cultured HeLa cells. These particles segregated in three discrete subpopulations with characteristic physicochemical properties: one containing hY5 RNA (RohY5 particles), one containing only hY4 RNA (RohY4 particles) and one with hY1, hY3, and hY4 RNAs (RohY1-hY4 particles). The RohY5 particles were purified free of contaminating ribonucleoproteins; both the La and the 60-kD Ro polypeptides were stable components of this portion of the Ro RNPs. The La RNPs co-purified with the RohY4 particles and contaminated the RohY1-hY4 RNPs. The stable association between the La and the 60-kD Ro polypeptides provides a potential macromolecular target for the linked set of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, and suggests a possible functional association of these polypeptides.\r"

To ensure a constant supply of cholesterol and to label newly synthesized bile acids, RS[2-14C]mevalonolactone was infused intraduodenally at 154 mumol/h before and during bile-acid infusion. Mevalonolactone inhibited hydroxymethyl-glutaryl CoA reductase activity 90% but did not increase bile-acid synthesis and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. When sodium taurocholate was infused at the rate of 27 mumol/100 g rat per h (equivalent to the hourly hepatic bile-acid flux), bile-acid synthesis decreased 82% and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity declined 78%. This inhibitory effect was observed in the absence of hepatic damage. In contrast, sodium tauroursocholate infused at the same rate did not decrease bile-acid synthesis nor cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Hepatic cholesterol content rose 36% with sodium taurocholate but did not change during sodium tauroursocholate administration. These results demonstrate that the feedback inhibition of bile-acid synthesis is mediated through the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. In these experiments, taurocholate was a far more potent inhibitor than its 7 beta-hydroxy epimer, tauroursocholate.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac hypertrophy produced in vivo by pressure overload is characterized by selective up-regulation of the fetal/neonatal beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) isogene. However, a molecular signal for beta-MHC isogene induction has not been identified. We examined cardiac MHC isogene expression in a cell culture model for hypertrophy. alpha-MHC and beta-MHC iso-protein and iso-mRNA levels in cultured cardiac myocytes were quantified during hypertrophy stimulated by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, norepinephrine (NE). beta-MHC iso-protein content was increased 3.2-fold vs. control (P less than 0.001), whereas alpha-MHC isoprotein content was not changed significantly (1.4-fold vs. control, P = NS). MHC iso-mRNA levels were quantified by nuclease S1 analysis, using a single oligonucleotide probe. NE increased beta-MHC iso-mRNA content by 3.9-fold vs. control (P less than 0.001), but there was no change in alpha-MHC iso-mRNA (1.1-fold vs. control, P = NS). The NE-stimulated increase in beta-MHC iso-mRNA preceded in time the increase in beta-MHC isoprotein accumulation. The EC50 for NE induction of beta-MHC was 40 nM, and pharmacologic experiments indicated alpha 1-adrenergic receptor specificity. alpha-MHC isogene expression was predominant in control myocytes (68% alpha-isoprotein and 60% alpha-iso-mRNA). In contrast, beta-MHC expression was equal to alpha-MHC or predominant after treatment with NE (51% beta-isoprotein and 69% beta-iso-mRNA). Thus, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation increases the cellular contents of beta-MHC iso-mRNA and beta-MHC isoprotein during hypertrophy of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, but does not change the levels of alpha-MHC iso-mRNA or isoprotein. The effect on beta-MHC is mediated primarily at the level of mRNA steady-state level (pretranslational). Activation of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor is the first identified molecular signal for increased beta-MHC isogene expression in a model of cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

This study was performed in plasma from 18 healthy subjects and 30 patients with HANE in remission: 20 with low antigen concentration (type I) and 10 (from 5 different kindreds) with dysfunctional protein (type II). Both type-I and type-II patients had increased C1(-)-C1(-)-Inh complexes (P less than 0.0001), which in type I inversely correlated with the levels of C1(-)-Inh (P less than 0.001). iC1(-)-Inh was normal in all type-I patients and in type-II patients from three families with increased C1(-)-Inh antigen, whereas iC1(-)-Inh was higher than 20 times the normal values in patients from the remaining two families with C1(-)-Inh antigen in the normal range. None of the subjects had an increase of either Factor XIIa-C1(-)-Inh or kallikrein-C1(-)-Inh complexes. This study shows that the hypercatabolism of C1(-)-Inh in HANE patients at least in part occurs via the formation of complexes with C1- and that genetically determined differences in catabolism of dysfunctional C1(-)-Inh proteins are present in type-II patients.\r"

To reveal the function of each lipase, an in vitro study was carried out with purified lipases and cofactors, and with human milk as substrate. Conditions were chosen to resemble those of the physiologic environment in the gastrointestinal tract of breast-fed infants. Gastric lipase was unique in its ability to initiate hydrolysis of milk triacylglycerol. Activated bile salt-stimulated lipase could not on its own hydrolyze native milk fat globule triacylglycerol, whereas a limited hydrolysis by gastric lipase triggered hydrolysis by bile salt-stimulated lipase. Gastric lipase and colipase-dependent lipase, in combination, hydrolyzed about two thirds of total ester bonds, with monoacylglycerol and fatty acids being the end products. Addition of bile salt-stimulated lipase resulted in hydrolysis also of monoacylglycerol. When acting together with colipase-dependent lipase, bile salt-stimulated lipase contributed also to digestion of tri- and diacylglycerol. We conclude that digestion of human milk triacylglycerol depends on three lipases with unique, only partly overlapping, functions. Their concerted action results in complete digestion with free glycerol and fatty acids as final products.\r"

The appearance of such receptors was examined during differentiation of human and mouse bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of IL-3. As already reported, mouse bone marrow yield cultures of greater than 95% mast cells by 3 wk, whereas human bone marrow develop into cultures comprising 25% basophils by 3 wk. Here we show that transcripts for Fc epsilon RI subunits and membrane-associated receptors are apparent by 1 wk in both human and murine IL-3-dependent bone marrow cells. These cells contain few, if any, granules. The expression of transcripts and the number of receptor-positive cells continue to increase over 3 wk of culture. In parallel, a progressively larger number of cells become increasingly granulated to finally resemble either basophils or mast cells. Mature peripheral human basophils also contain transcripts for Fc epsilon RI and, therefore, may have the potential to synthesize de novo receptors. The early appearance of Fc epsilon FI during cell differentiation may be important for these cells to respond to IgE-mediated stimuli before granulation. The physiologic role of Fc epsilon RI could be to mediate lymphokine production (IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) without inducing cellular degranulation.\r"

This is the first in vivo, prospective evidence of the antiatherogenic effect of HDL-VHDL against preexisting atherosclerosis.

We have developed a technique, based on the pH dependent affinity of iminobiotin for streptavidin, for the isolation of an endothelial cell membrane component that binds S. aureus, in vitro. A 50-kD membrane component was isolated and purified using this approach. This component was trypsin sensitive, periodate insensitive, and did not label with [3H]glucosamine. [35S]Methionine and [125I]iodine labeling confirmed that the protein was synthesized by and expressed on the endothelial cell surface. Functional binding studies demonstrated that staphylococci, but not endothelial cells, bound to the protein when immobilized on microtiter wells. Preincubation of staphylococci with the purified protein significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced staphylococcal binding to cultured endothelial cells. The capacity of S. aureus to colonize and invade endovascular surfaces may in part be a consequence of staphylococcal interaction with this endothelial cell membrane protein.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that monohydroxy bile acids exert their cholestatic and hepatotoxic effects via a sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] was tested in the isolated perfused rat liver. Infusion of the specific inhibitor of microsomal Ca2+ sequestration, 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) (25 microM for 10 min) produced efflux of Ca2+ from the liver and a sustained (20 min) increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] as indicated by the threefold increase in hepatic glucose output. Release of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool was demonstrated by the complete abolition of vasopressin- and phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ exchange between the liver and perfusate. Despite the profound perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis produced by tBuBHQ, there was no decrease in bile flow and no evidence of hepatocellular injury (for 60 min), as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase release. In contrast, lithocholic acid (25 microM for 10 or 30 min) or taurolithocholic acid (5 microM for 10 or 30 min) produced an 80-90% inhibition of bile flow and a progressive increase in perfusate lactate dehydrogenase activity. During and after bile acid infusion, there was no change in Ca2+ fluxes between liver and perfusate, no stimulation of glucose output from the liver, and hormone-stimulated Ca2+ responses were preserved. It is concluded that the mechanisms for bile acid-induced cholestasis and hepatotoxicity in the intact liver are not attributable to changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and especially not to prolonged release or depletion of Ca2+ sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of minimally modified LDL (MM-LDL) on the ability of large vessel endothelial cells (EC) to interact with monocytes and neutrophils was examined. These LDL preparations, obtained by storage or by mild iron oxidation, were indistinguishable from native LDL to the LDL receptor and were not recognized by the scavenger receptor. Treatment of EC with as little as 0.12 micrograms/ml MM-LDL caused a significant increase in the production of chemotactic factor for monocytes (sevenfold) and increased monocyte binding (three- to fivefold). Monocyte binding was maximal after 4 h of EC exposure to MM-LDL, persisted for 48 h, and was inhibited by cycloheximide. In contrast, neutrophil binding was not increased after 1-24 h of exposure. Activity in the MM-LDL preparations was found primarily in the polar lipid fraction. MM-LDL was toxic for EC from one rabbit but not toxic for the cells from another rabbit or any human umbilical vein EC. The resistant cells became sensitive when incubated with lipoprotein in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas the sensitive strain became resistant when preincubated with sublethal concentrations of MM-LDL. We conclude that exposure of EC to sublethal levels of MM-LDL enhances monocyte endothelial interactions and induces resistance to the toxic effects of MM-LDL.\r"

  ".W": "Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to analyze bile acids in the body fluids of an infant (L.C.) whose liver contained no immunoreactive peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase. The profiles were compared with those of six patients with undetectable peroxisomes (Zellweger syndrome) and two siblings (N.B. and I.B.) whose defect of peroxisomal beta-oxidation could not be localized by morphological studies of peroxisomes or by immunoblotting of peroxisomal beta-oxidation proteins. 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-Trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid (THCA) was present in bile and plasma of all patients. However, bile from L.C., N.B. and I.B. contained unconjugated varanic acid (3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha, 24-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid) as the major C27 bile acid, whereas bile from Zellweger patients contained only small amounts of varanic acid. In the bile from L.C. two isomers of varanic acid were present; in the bile from N.B. and I.B. a single isomer predominated. L.C., N.B., and I.B. all produced bile containing small amounts of (24E)-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholest-24-en-26-oic acid [( 24E]-delta 24-THCA), its [24Z]- isomer, 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholest-23-en-26-oic acid and 3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-27-nor-5 beta-cholestan-24-one. The results provide evidence for peroxisomal pathways for cholic acid synthesis in man via THCA, delta 24-THCA and varanic acid and show that bile acid analyses can be used to diagnose peroxisomal thiolase deficiency.\r"

In this report we have studied the formation of cells with the osteoclast phenotype in long-term cultures of marrow mononuclear cells derived from patients with Paget's disease, and compared these with similar cells formed in long-term marrow cultures from normal individuals, and with osteoclasts present in pagetic bone. Osteoclasts formed in pagetic marrow cultures resembled osteoclasts present in pagetic bone, but were distinctly different from osteoclasts formed in normal marrow cultures. Osteoclast formation was 10-20-fold greater in pagetic marrow cultures than in normal cultures. The multinucleated cells formed in cultures of pagetic marrow were much larger in size, were hyperresponsive to 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, had more nuclei per cell, had increased levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and had ultrastructural features which were not seen in multinucleated cells formed from normal marrow mononuclear cells. These pagetic marrow-derived multinucleated cells formed large resorption lacunae on calcified matrices and cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies which preferentially bind to osteoclasts. The multinucleated cells formed from marrow obtained from uninvolved sites in Paget's patients also displayed these abnormal features.\r"

  ".U": "90203240\r", 
  ".W": "As a model system to explore the functional consequences of structural variants of human Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma R), we have investigated Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis in relation to the NA1-NA2 polymorphism of Fc gamma RIII (CD16) on neutrophils (Fc gamma RIIIPMN). The neutrophil-specific NA antigen system is a biallelic polymorphism with codominant expression demonstrating a gene dose effect with the anti-NA1 MAb CLB-gran 11 in a large donor population. To explore the impact of this allelic variation of Fc gamma RIIIPMN on phagocytosis, we used two Fc gamma RIII-dependent probes, IgG-sensitized erythrocytes (EA) and concanavalin. A-treated erythrocytes (E-ConA). Comparison of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis by PMN from NA1 subjects and from NA2 subjects showed lower levels of phagocytosis of both probes by the NA2 individuals. The difference was most pronounced with lightly opsonized EA: at the lowest level of sensitization the phagocytic index was 72% lower for NA2 donors, whereas at the highest level of sensitization it was 21% lower (P less than 0.003). Blockade of Fc gamma RII with MAb IV.3 Fab amplified by threefold the difference between NA1 and NA2 donors. NA1 and NA2 individuals had identical phagocytic capacities for the non-Fc gamma RIII probes, serum-treated and heat-treated zymosan. These individuals did not show differential quantitative cell surface expression of Fc gamma RIIIPMN measured by a panel of anti-CD16 MAb (3G8, CLB FcR-gran 1, VEP13, BW209/2) and by Scatchard analysis of 125I-IgG dimer binding. The difference in Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis was not explicable on the basis of differential collaboration of Fc gamma RIIIPMN alleles with Fc gamma RII, since (a) the difference in phagocytic capacity between NA1 and NA2 individuals was readily apparent with the E-ConA probe (which is independent of Fc gamma RII) and (b) the difference in phagocytosis of EA was magnified by Fc gamma RII blockade. The demonstration that allelic polymorphisms in Fc gamma R can have significant consequences for physiological functions implies that within the structural complexity of human Fc gamma Rs, including both allelic forms and cell type-specific isoforms, there will be differences in quantitative, and perhaps qualitative, function with potential importance for disease processes.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], regulates colonic calcium absorption and colonocyte proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we have examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on membrane phosphoinositide turnover, protein kinase C activation, and regulation of intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca+2]i) in isolated rat colonic epithelium. In a concentration-dependent manner, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides within 15 s, generating diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). 1,25(OH)2D3 rapidly activated colonic protein kinase C, with maximal translocation of activity from the cytosol to the membrane occurring within 1 min of exposure to the secosteroid. Studies performed in isolated colonocytes with the fluorescent dye fura-2 demonstrated that 10(-8) M 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a rapid rise in [Ca+2]i which then transiently decreased before rising to a new plateau value. When these experiments were performed in a calcium-free buffer, an increase in [Ca+2]i was observed, but both the transient and secondary rise were diminished in magnitude, suggesting that 1,25(OH)2D3 may stimulate both release of intracellular calcium stores and calcium influx. 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake in rat colonocytes, 4 h after an in vivo injection. These studies indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts a rapid influence on membrane phosphoinositide metabolism which may mediate certain of the secosteroid's effects on colonocyte calcium transport and proliferation.\r"

It has been shown that the absence of the aspartic acid in position 57 (Asp57) of the DQ beta chain is positively correlated to IDDM. However, Asp57-negative haplotypes do not always confer susceptibility and conversely, some Asp57-positive haplotypes seem to be disease associated. It has been suggested that other HLA class II sequences, probably belonging to the HLA DQA1 gene, confer susceptibility to IDDM. This report, based on extensive oligonucleotide dot blot hybridization of PCR-amplified DQA1 and DQB1 genes, reinforces the importance of the Asp57-negative DQ beta chain, but also introduces the possibility that a DQ alpha chain bearing an arginine in position 52 (Arg52) confers susceptibility to IDDM. A molecular model of susceptibility to IDDM is proposed. This model strongly suggests that the disease susceptibility correlates quantitatively with the expression at the cell surface of a heterodimer, composed of a DQ alpha-chain bearing an Arg52 and a DQ beta chain lacking an Asp57. In view of the respective positions of the two residues and their charge, we might anticipate that both residues DQ beta Asp57 and DQ alpha Arg52 are critical for modulation of susceptibility, presumably via viral-antigenic peptide and/or autoantigen presentation.\r"

Subsequent injection of EBV resulted in the rapid development (within 19-33 d) of aggressive, fatal, lymphoproliferative disorders of human B cell origin. Autopsies revealed solid tumors in the abdomen, and occasionally in the liver, thymus, or spleen. Histopathologic analysis showed that the tumors were high-grade immunoblastic lymphomas and FACS analyses of tumor cells indicated that they were of human B-lymphoid origin. The tumor cells grew in vitro and induced new tumors on injection into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Karyotypic analysis and Southern blots for c-myc or bcl-2 rearrangements revealed no chromosomal abnormalities and translocations. Southern blot analysis also showed that the cells possessed EBV DNA sequences. Although these tumors undoubtedly reflect infection of the transferred B cells with EBV in vivo, intraperitoneal transfer of short-term lymphoid cell lines transformed in vitro with EBV resulted in ascites production without evidence of tumor formation.\r"

Arterial blood pressure remained elevated for approximately 5 mo, but decreased progressively in the last 3 mo so that at 8 mo this parameter was practically identical to that found in controls. Moreover, left ventricular end diastolic pressure was markedly increased in experimental animals in association with a substantial decrease in left ventricular dP/dt. The alteration of these physiological measurements was indicative of severe ventricular dysfunction. Quantitative analysis of the transmural distribution of myocyte nuclei in the left ventricle showed 36 and 23% increases in myocyte nuclei concentration in the epimyocardium and endomyocardium, respectively. These changes in nuclei were accompanied by 25 and 16% reductions in myocyte cell volume per nucleus in the outer and inner layers of the wall. In conclusion, long-term hypertension leads to impairment of ventricular function and proliferation of nuclei in myocytes.\r"

The GRP content of the mucosa measured by radioimmunoassay was 0.60 +/- 0.25 pmol/g tissue (n = 9 patients; mean +/- SEM). GRP-immunoreactive nerves detected by the immunogold method of indirect immunohistochemistry were found predominantly in small muscular arteries, arterioles, venous sinusoids, and between submucosal gland acini. 125I-GRP binding sites determined by autoradiography were exclusively and specifically localized to nasal epithelium and submucosal glands. There was no binding to vessels. The effects of GRP on submucosal gland product release were studied in short-term explant culture. GRP (10 microM) significantly stimulated the release of the serous cell-specific product lactoferrin, and [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoconjugates which are products of epithelial goblet cells and submucosal gland cells. These observations indicate that GRP released from nerve fibers probably acts on glandular GRP receptors to induce glycoconjugate release from submucosal glands and epithelium and lactoferrin release from serous cells, but that GRP would probably not affect vascular permeability.\r"

This was precipitated by PEG and was shown by exclusion chromatography to contain IgG in a high molecular weight form.

The most striking of these was follicular hyperplasia in which the germinal centres, in spite of being quite large, showed relatively sparse proliferative activity. The nodes often showed infiltration of germinal centres by CD8 positive T lymphocytes and contained fewer IL2R positive cells in the paracortex than controls. These and other features may have some correlation with disease activity. Lymphadenopathy in rheumatoid arthritis may not just be a manifestation of joint inflammation but an active component of this multisystem disease and may reflect a widespread immunological abnormality.\r"

Brissot scores for assessing histological hepatic iron deposition and chemically measured liver iron concentrations correlated closely. Both variables depended on total cumulative dose of iron, and to a lesser extent, on time since the last dose. Fibrosis (seen in five patients) was minimal and non-specific. Electron microscopic examination showed that there was no generalised damage and confirmed the presence of iron in the hepatocytes in the form of ferritin. High liver iron concentrations, in excess of 1000 micrograms/100 mg dry weight, were seen in two patients. Four others given comparable cumulated amounts (18-23 g iron) did not have such high concentrations. Plasma ferritin concentrations were high in eight patients, some with and some without fibrosis. The risk of temporarily high iron deposition in the liver causing damage seemed to be minimal when weighed against the benefit of increased haemoglobin in most of the patients. Intravenous iron treatment merits further evaluation, particularly with the advent of erythropoietin treatment, which requires continuously available iron.\r"

Ninety tissue specimens in a single analysis were examined using this technique. Alkaline hydrolysis was applied to fixed tissue samples which showed a two-fold increase over the past 10 years in the percentage of anal cancers containing HPV type 16 DNA when compared with the previous 30 years using 207 cases of anal cancer collected over a 40 year period. This method has several advantages over the polymerase chain reaction as it is simple, relatively inexpensive, and may be widely applied to the detection and quantification of DNA sequences, including cellular oncogenes.\r"

  ".U": "90203283\r", 
  ".W": "Cytoimmunological monitoring and quantitative birefringence measurements were used as potential aids in diagnosing acute rejection after heart transplantation instead of histopathological assessment of the endomyocardial biopsy specimen alone. Cytoimmunological monitoring was based on morphological inspection and quantitation of mononuclear cells, particularly activated lymphoid cells. Quantitative birefringence measurements comprise a variable for myocyte contractile function. Its read out is the ratio of the degree of birefringence before contraction to that after. Cytoimmunological monitoring indicated significantly higher concentrations of activated lymphocytes in moderate or severe acute rejection, and quantitative birefringence measurements indicated decreased myocyte function during severe and resolved or resolving rejection. Cytoimmunological monitoring and quantitative birefringence measurements were diagnostically most useful in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, when only data gathered before the first episode of acute rejection were considered. For cytoimmunological monitoring, diagnostic relevance was optimal when the data were expressed as relative proportions of activated lymphocytes. The quantitative birefringence measurements correlated best with analysis of the endomyocardial biopsy specimen when a cut off value of 1.25 was used. When both methods for diagnosing acute rejection were analysed together, no improvement in sensitivity (value 0.44) was found, but the specificity increased to 0.98 and the predictive value to about 0.80. It is concluded that cytoimmunological monitoring is a useful, non-invasive additional method for diagnosing the first period of acute rejection after heart transplantation and that quantitative birefringence measurements give valuable information on the extent of myocyte damage.\r"

There was significantly less mucin in the groups with ulcerative colitis compared with either those with Crohn's disease or the normal controls. The difference in the gland content between the groups with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and between the group with Crohn's disease and the normal controls did not reach significance. The results suggest that it is worth while assessing the mucin content of rectal biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In routine practice this assessment can be made by eye using a suitably stained section.\r"

Changes in tissue from 17 patients previously treated for breast cancer by surgery and radiotherapy were compared with those seen in a control group treated with surgery alone. Vascular and epithelial changes were seen only in tissue from patients who had received radiotherapy and, therefore, seemed to be relatively specific; stromal changes were seen in both groups and seemed, therefore, to be non-specific. Epithelial atypia is of particular importance as it may be severe and be confused with recurrent malignancy. The presence of other changes associated with radiotherapy, particularly those in vessels, should help to avoid such misdiagnosis.\r"

One hundred nuclei and their nucleoli on each slide were measured with a graphic tablet system at a total magnification of 2800 times using a stratified selection method. The number of nucleoli per 100 nuclei was also noted. Analysis of Kaplan-Meier univariate recurrence free survival curves showed significant differences for eight nuclear features, nine nucleolar features, and three combined nuclear and nucleolar variables. The total number of nucleoli per 100 nuclei was the best single prognostic variable. Multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model) showed that no other features provided additional prognostic information beyond that given by the total number of nucleoli. It is concluded that nucleolar morphometric variables assessed in cytological preparations have prognostic value in breast cancer, and the results of this study suggest that their prognostic value may exceed that of nuclear variables.\r"

Methods of recovering costs of routine and emergency services, of capital investment in equipment, of instrument maintenance costs and of general hospital overheads were considered. The Welcan unit system of workload measurement was applied to a range of test procedures. Both the Welcan unit value and unit value adjusted fro calibration and quality control (Welcan based weighting) correlated only moderately with locally derived analytical time per test and correlated poorly with direct analytical cost per test. The correlation of direct analytical cost per test with total cost per test was much stronger than that of analytical time per test with direct analytical cost per test. The data suggest that neither Welcan unit values, Welcan based weightings, nor locally derived analytical time per test can truly reflect total resource consumption for the provision of a range of test procedures. This factor should be borne in mind when applying operational or performance indicators based on Welcan units.\r"

The temporal association between chemical exposure and the onset of first symptoms of anaemia was strongly supportive. Organochlorines have the property of lipid affinity and accumulation in adipose tissue. Objective evidence of clinically important concentrations of tissue pesticide residues may be a useful confirmation of previous exposure. In the patients studied the presence of Lindane (gamma hexachlorocyclohexane) was shown using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring of fragments obtained from one heavily exposed patient, with concentrations about five times greater than a matched control. The presence of clinically important tissue concentrations of pentachlorophenol was also confirmed in a second patient exposed to this agent. The long term safety of organochlorine pesticides remains doubtful as they were introduced before adequate toxicological screening tests had been developed. The central registration of possible haematological adverse reactions, however, forms an important epidemiological method in the study of environmental chemical hazards and should be complied with whenever possible.\r"

  ".W": "We identified nine patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma in whom the neoplastic cells expressed the CD8 (T8) suppressor T cell phenotype instead of the more common CD4 (T4) helper T cell phenotype. Five had rapidly progressive disease characterized by distinctive papulonodular skin lesions (four patients), involvement of palms or soles (four patients) or oral cavity (two patients), and poor response to standard topical therapy (four patients). Histologic examination showed extensive epidermotropism often associated with pagetoid features. Immunoperoxidase studies revealed a novel aberrant T cell phenotype characterized by lack of expression of CD4 and CD2 (T11) but positive staining for CD3 (T3) and CD7 (3A1). In contrast, the neoplastic cells from four patients with clinically more chronic CD8+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma, although also commonly epidermotropic, had a different aberrant T cell phenotype similar to that often seen in CD4+ mycosis fungoides; that is, there was lack of expression of CD7 but a positive reaction to staining for CD2. In two cases the tumor cells acquired the CD7 antigen or lost the CD2 antigen with progression of the disease. Two cases were analyzed with Southern blotting and both showed rearranged DNA bands that confirmed the presence of clonal populations of T cells. Our findings suggest the following: (1) CD8+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma can be rapidly progressive or chronic. (2) These two types cannot be reliably distinguished by histologic features. (3) Rapid progression was associated with a CD2-, CD7+ phenotype whereas chronicity was associated with a CD2+, CD7- phenotype.\r"

The bacterial flora of macerated interspaces showed a significantly higher incidence of resistance to multiple antibiotics, and the recovery of antibiotic-resistant bacteria correlated with the recovery of dermatophytes that produce penicillin-like substances. The results of this study support the hypothesis that overgrowth of the resident bacterial population determines the severity of interdigital toe-web infections.\r"

We observed three patients with well-documented epidermolysis bullosa acquisita that developed several years before the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus. One patient was producing anti-U1RNP autoantibodies at the time epidermolysis bullosa acquisita was diagnosed, and all five produced this antibody during the systemic lupus erythematosus phase of their illness. In addition, in all five cases of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita with systemic lupus erythematosus antibodies to double-stranded DNA ultimately developed, and severe systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis developed in four patients. Sera from 15 other patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita without overt systemic lupus erythematosus were analyzed for systemic lupus erythematosus-related autoantibodies. Four patients were found to have at least one such autoantibody. These findings further document an association between epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and systemic lupus erythematosus and suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who present with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita may represent a subset of lupus erythematosus that puts the patient at increased risk for the development of more severe systemic illness. Patients presenting with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, especially those who are black or Hispanic, should be monitored for the development of potentially life-threatening systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

The second variant consists of erythematous to violaceous plaques, some of which show follicular prominence; the histologic appearance is that of a lichenoid inflammatory cell infiltrate that affects both follicular and interfollicular areas. The third variant manifests as follicular papules of the scalp with concomitant or subsequent cicatricial alopecia. In this variant the histologic hallmark is a lichenoid, follicular and interfollicular inflammation, associated with or followed by scarring. Overlap among the three variants exists, and hence the concept of a disease spectrum ranging from pure follicular involvement without evidence of clinical scarring to cicatricial alopecia of the scalp is advocated.\r"

  ".W": "Deficiencies of Leu-8 and CD7 antigens are exhibited by CD3+ T cells in the skin lesions of most patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome. To determine whether these antigenic abnormalities are limited to involved skin, we studied Leu-8/CD7 expression in 21 skin lesions of mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome obtained from 16 patients and compared them with their peripheral blood leukocytes obtained concurrently. There was no correlation between Leu-8/CD7 values in skin lesions versus blood. Blood values were relatively uniform; most patients had 50% or greater of CD3+, Leu-8+ T cells and CD3+, CD7+ T cells. In contrast, skin values were highly heterogeneous; most patients lacked expression of Leu-8 or CD7 by the majority of lesional CD3+ T cells. Furthermore, Leu-8/CD7 antigen deficiency was present in lesional skin in one patient with mycosis fungoides but not in her concurrently sampled pityriasis lichenoides chronica or blood. These findings suggest that Leu-8/CD7 antigen deficiencies in skin lesions of mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome do not represent generalized antigenic abnormalities of CD3+ T cells in other body compartments and that within the skin, these deficiencies are disease specific within individual patients with more than one dermatosis. Comparative peripheral blood immunophenotyping of the patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and of the control subjects indicated that the control ranges of CD3+/Leu-8+ and CD3+/CD7+ T cells (33% or greater) extend lower than reported previously (60% or greater) and suggested that leukemic involvement in patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome may correlate with percentages of CD3+, Leu8+ and/or CD3+, CD7+ T cells that fall below the revised control range.\r"

This observation suggests that nail changes may not result from the systemic manifestations. We also report for the first time the histopathologic findings of the nail matrix and bed, which demonstrate dense, fibrous tissue replacing subungual stroma with numerous ectatic, endothelium-lined vessels that are similar to that in the pleura in yellow nail syndrome.

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have different effects on squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels. Kidney failure also causes elevated levels. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen is not a reliable tumor marker in patients with squamous cell carcinoma at any site when these patients also have a cutaneous disorder that involves more than 2% of the skin surface area or when they have kidney failure.\r"

On contact with Rhus verniciflua, the Japanese lacquer tree, the patient had a flare of the eruption, which was limited to the areas previously exposed to sun. Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the keratinocytes in the skin that retain teh photoactivated substances may facilitate epidermal invasion of lymphocytes by persistent expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1.\r"

Twenty-six papers published between January 1977 and January 1988, in English, French, and Italian were selected. We used a standardized protocol of evaluation, which focused principally on the reporting of methods. Twelve papers were uncontrolled studies. Of the controlled studies, 11 had a self-controlled design, two studies involved the use of parallel concurrent controls, and seven were randomized trials. With regard to criteria for entry, follow-up schedules, and criteria for evaluation of response to treatment, the studies were scored generally poorly; therapeutic regimen, patients' characteristics, withdrawals, and description of side effects in these studies were rated more highly. In light of our results, further and better-designed studies are needed for acceptance of dinitrochlorobenzene, squaric acid dibutylester, and diphencyprone in current therapy.\r"

Percentage of calories from fat was related to frequency of consumption and amount of consumption, respectively, of bacon (r = .48, .49), frankfurters and sausage (r = .45, .45), and french fries and fried potatoes (r = .43, .39). Frequency and amount, respectively, of consumption of fruits were most highly correlated with intake of vitamin A (r = .45, .46), vitamin C (r = .44, .48), and dietary fiber (r = .43, .43).

Parameters evaluated and compared for each diet were body composition, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, percent body fat, and nutrient intake. Each diet group contained at least 11 women. Behavioral approaches were used to ensure that subjects complied with the caloric intake and the dietary pattern. No significant differences were found in the parameters except for BUN, which was significantly greater in the 25% carbohydrate group. Each 1,200-kcal diet contributed to weight loss. Selection of a weight reduction diet can be designed around preferred food patterns and nutrition needs of individuals rather than a proportion of the energy provided by carbohydrate in healthy adult women. Practitioners may use this research to demonstrate to clients that body weight can be lost while following a variety of nutritious diets.\r"

The Index for Nutritional Quality (INQ), which is the observed nutrient density divided by the recommended nutrient density, was estimated for seven nutrients from data reported on food frequency questionnaires and diet recalls. Mean INQs for protein and vitamin C were above the recommended level of 1.0, whereas INQ for iron was 0.6 or less. Mean INQ for calcium was 1.2 for whites and between 0.9 and 1.0 for non-whites. When comparisons were made among ethnic groups by site of prenatal care, significant differences in INQ were found for all nutrients except iron and vitamin B-6. WIC participants had higher diet quality for protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B-6 than did non-participants. Employed women had higher protein and zinc INQs than did unemployed women, and non-smokers had higher iron and vitamin B-6 INQs than did smokers. Variety was not significantly correlated with diet quality but differed (p less than .001) among site-specific ethnic groups. We conclude that there is a need for investigation of factors influencing dietary practices that are associated with sites of prenatal care.\r"

All the prenatal patients on whom complete data were available for a 2-year period were used. The 158 pregnant women gained a mean of 12.9 kg during their pregnancies; 44% gained more than 13.6 kg and 25% gained less than 9.1 kg. Three months after delivery the women showed gains significantly greater than those experienced by a nonpregnant comparison group during a comparable period. Maternal weight gain was determined by subtracting the infant's birth weight from the mother's total gain during pregnancy. Weight changes at three periods postpartum were compared among maternal weight gain tertiles. Sustained weight gains resulted in 39% of the women in the upper tertile being newly classified as overfat 1 to 3 months postpartum. Women in the high tertile had retained significantly more weight up through the sixth postpartum month. We conclude that a significant portion of maternal weight gain is likely to be retained, putting some women at risk of obesity.\r"

The dietetic services provided through TPS are highlighted for this sample of teens, 97% of whom were eligible for the WIC program. Average gestational age at time of enrollment for prenatal care was 18 weeks; 59% of the sample was anemic (hemoglobin value less than 120 gm/L). The average number of servings teens consumed each day from the four food groups was as follows: bread/grain, 5.0; milk, 2.8; meat, 2.8; and fruit/vegetable, 2.3. Teens who were overweight before pregnancy had heavier infants (mean = 3,344 gm) than their underweight peers (mean = 2,770 gm). Teens who gained 24 lb or less during pregnancy and who gave birth to full-term infants had infants with significantly lower birth weights (mean = 3,094 gm, p less than .008) than those who gained at least 25 lb (mean = 3,356 gm). Teens who smoked also had infants with lower birth weights than teens who did not smoke. Most teens bottle-fed their infants (82%). On the basis of our data, we conclude that low-income pregnant teens are likely to be at dietary risk. Dietary work with low-income pregnant adolescents is challenging and requires a thorough knowledge base about adolescent pregnancy, coupled with the ability to adapt traditional dietary counseling practices to meet the unique needs of these clients.\r"

As part of a larger study of children's food acquisition and exercise habits related to cardiovascular disease, a sample of 50 families was asked to keep itemized grocery receipts for a 2-week period. To control for bias as a result of differences in food consumption and food acquisition, mothers were asked to log meals eaten away from home, food used from home production, and gifts of foods. Items on the receipts were coded according to food groups and whether they represented child-prompted purchases. The items were expressed in terms of the percentage of the food dollar each category represented. Data from the survey were compared with data collected in national surveys. The method was found to be relatively non-intrusive, easily carried out, and eliminated many of the problems associated with non-response, respondent burden, and recall characteristic of other food account methods. It is suggested as a feasible way of characterizing the family food environment in epidemiological studies.\r"

Sixty-eight well, active, rural North Dakota seniors, 60 years or older, from communities of 2,500 or fewer people, participated in five focus groups conducted in late summer 1988. As a qualitative research approach, focus group interviews offer a means of obtaining in-depth information on a specific topic from representatives of a target audience in a discussion group atmosphere. Focus groups require careful preparation and structuring and should include a capable moderator, a prepared discussion guide, carefully recruited participants, and a comfortable setting. The process generated ideas that we are using to develop a health promotion nutrition intervention that will be a mailed-home approach, including use of incentives, social role models, cholesterol screening, and learning activities. The intervention relies on the interest and ability of seniors to make positive health changes. We conclude that the focus group approach is useful in developing nutrition education interventions.\r"

As of 1984, there were 317 graduates. The purpose of this study was to determine the employment, professional activity, and further education profiles of graduates in a 20-year period. The critical path method (CPM) was used as the blueprint for the 6-month project in which 267 questionnaires were sent and 152 were returned. Findings on areas of practice of graduates of the CDI/MDP indicated that their employment generally follows the same rankings as those found in previous studies of internship, CUP, and Plan IV programs, except for greater frequency of employment in education. Activities in professional associations were notable, with many graduates serving as officers or committee members. Twenty-one percent of respondents have earned or are in the process of pursuing study beyond the master of science earned with the internship. This may indicate that students interested in completing an internship/master's program have a strong achievement orientation or that they have an unusually high regard for education. Our findings provide valuable data for understanding the career impact of advanced education combined with the internship.\r"

The inability of S3 to activate Tcs in xid mice was shown to be due to a requirement of B cells for Tcs activation rather than to an absence of Tcs in xid mice. The B cells from normal mice that are required for Tcs activation apparently function to present the S3 Ag to Tcs. S3 physically coupled to spleen cells (S3-SC) prepared from normal BCF1 SC could activate Tcs in both xid and BCF1 mice whereas S3-SC prepared from xid SC or B cell-depleted BCF1 SC could not activate Tcs in either strain. B cell APC function was abrogated by 3000 R irradiation and by treatment of the B cells with either chloroquine or paraformaldehyde. Interestingly, B cells from mice previously immunized with S3 were unable to function in Tcs activation; preimmunization of B cell donors with an irrelevant Ag or with a T-dependent form of S3 had no effect on their ability to function as APC. These latter observations are discussed in terms of the in vivo persistence of polysaccharide Ag and their ability to induce B cell tolerance under the experimental conditions used for these experiments. The results of this study provide evidence that B cells play an important and apparently obligatory role in the activation of Tcs by S3; B cells apparently function to present Ag to Tcs, resulting in the activation of this regulatory T cell subset.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous infusion of hapten-derivatized epidermal cells (EC) in syngeneic mice leads to two competing signals for contact hypersensitivity (CH), a dominant effector signal attributable to Langerhans cells (LC) and a suppressor signal from Thy-1+ EC. In vitro exposure of LC to low dose ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation before hapten-derivatization and infusion not only results in the abrogation of their effector signal but also causes the down-regulation of subsequent CH responses. To delineate the relevance of i.v. immunization to the study of CH and of LC as the immunologic targets of low dose UVB radiation, we examined the migratory and immunogenic properties of EC after i.v. infusion. Unsorted EC migrated from blood to skin and lymphoid tissues, reaching steady state distributions at 16 h after infusion. No significant differences were observed between the trafficking of EC in syngeneic and allogeneic transfers. LC localized preferentially to skin, whereas Thy-1+ EC trafficked to skin, the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. The pattern of trafficking of unirradiated and low dose UVB-irradiated LC were identical, suggesting that low dose UVB radiation had little effect on LC migration. Finally, skin graft experiments demonstrated i.v. infused, hapten-derivatized LC that migrate to skin to retain their capacity to induce CH, a property that was converted by in vitro pretreatment with low dose UVB radiation into down-regulation. These findings confirm the relevance and utility of the i.v. immunization model in the study of CH and the influence of low dose UVB on this immune response. Our data also provide a basis for investigating the role of disparate trafficking patterns in generating effector and suppressor signals when hapten-derivatized EC are employed for CH.\r"

When assessed for binding capacity, several peptides were shown to have increased affinity for IAd compared with the parent sequence, and in addition, some peptides had acquired binding specificities for class II MHC haplotypes not present for OVA 323-339. These peptides were next examined for their ability to inhibit T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. The correlation between binding and the ability to inhibit T cell activation in vitro was good. However, when assessed in vivo, it was clear that high Ia binding was not sufficient in itself to define the inhibitory capacity of a given peptide. That this discrepancy was due to differences in degradation of the core-extended peptides was suggested by 1) results from an inhibition of Ag presentation assay, in which the pulse period with Ag and inhibitor was extended to 20 h; and 2) direct analysis of peptide stability by using reverse phase HPLC. Finally, by protecting the peptide from degradation with N- and C-terminal substitutions of D-amino acids, the inhibitory capacity of an unstable core-extended peptide in vitro could be greatly enhanced. These data indicate that the core extension approach may be one method by which antagonists for MHC class II molecules may be generated.\r"

  ".U": "90203576\r", 
  ".W": "Fc region fragments derived from the enzymatic cleavage of human IgG have been shown to induce human peripheral blood-derived B cells to differentiate into Ig secreting cells (ISC). The synthetic peptide p23, corresponding to residues 335 to 357 in the Fc region of human IgG1, represents a region of the molecule responsible for stimulation of ISC formation. Fc region-induced ISC formation requires at least two signals; one supplied by Fc region activators and one supplied by a T cell-derived factor(s). In this report we show that the coculture of human PBMC with pFc' or p23, results in the release of factor(s) that resemble IL-6 in its pattern of biologic activity. This conclusion is based on the observations that supernatants from Fc region-stimulated PBMC cultures contained increased levels of elements that scored as positive in two assays for IL-6: the B9.9 hybridoma growth and the CESS cell differentiation assays. Moreover, RNA from Fc region-stimulation PBMC contained increased levels of IL-6 cDNA-hybridizable elements. Finally, it was observed that rabbit anti-IL-6 inhibited the ability of supernatants derived from Fc region-stimulated PBMC cultures to induce B9.9 cell proliferation as well as p23-induced ISC formation in intact PBMC cultures. Fc region fragments induce both monocytes and T cells to produce IL-6. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-6 is produced in Fc region-stimulated PBMC cultures and is involved in B cell activation by these activators.\r"

Both 0249F and NU-T2 two CD1b specific mAb tested, induced a rapid increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration on HPBALL T cells whereas only one (L161) among three different CD1c mAb (L161, 10C3, and M241) produced a similar effect. In contrast the addition of four different CD1a mAb directed against two different epitopic groups of this molecule were uneffective in modifying the intracellular Ca2+. Both L161 and 0249F also induced a comparable increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration on MOLT 4 and JURKAT, two other T cell lines of similar phenotype. The effect of L161 mAb on the IL-2 production of the IL-2 producing T cell line JURKAT was also examined. The association of the latter with PMA strongly induced the production of IL-2 on this cell model while either L161 or PMA alone had no effect. Although the natural ligand and the function of CD1 molecules are still unknown, the accumulation of these data strongly suggest that CD1b and CD1c might represent two activatory pathways for immature T cells operating before the classical CD2 and CD3 activation pathways.\r"

The purified follicular lymphoma cells, which are morphologically uniform, small, and dense, did not respond to stimulation with soluble lymphokines in the absence of T cells. Vigorous in vitro proliferation of follicular lymphoma cells was induced, however, when the follicular lymphoma cells were cultured with a CD4+ T cell clone which recognized alloantigens expressed by the lymphoma cells. This response required B-T cell contact, and was inhibited by anti-class II but not by anti-class I MHC mAb, indicating that these neoplastic B cells behaved as normal B cells and responded to normal activation and differentiation signals from T cells. After the cognate B lymphoma-T cell interaction occurred in culture, addition of IL-2 or IL-4 enhanced the proliferation of the tumor cells. These results, with a monoclonal and homogeneous population of B cells, affirm the idea that cognate interaction between B cells and Th cells is required for the effective activation of resting B cells. Moreover, these results suggest that a critical host-tumor interaction occurs in vivo, and that the polyclonal CD4+ T cells that infiltrate follicular lymphomas play a role in sustaining rather than inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. If so, therapies directed not only against the neoplastic cell but also against specific T cells and their cognate interactions with tumor cells may have a rationale.\r"

LPS elicits several responses in leukocytes including secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and priming for enhanced release of oxygen radicals such as superoxide anion. To determine if expression of CD18 molecules is necessary for these effects of LPS, we have examined the responses of leukocytes from CD18-deficient patients. Three of the patients in this study are characterized for the first time here, and three were described elsewhere. Monocytes and macrophages from CD18-deficient patients synthesized normal amounts of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in response to LPS. Further, PMN and monocytes from CD18-deficient patients showed normal priming for enhanced release of superoxide anion in response to LPS. Although a small contribution of CD18 molecules to some responses cannot be ruled out by our data, we may conclude that CD18 molecules are not essential for cellular responses to LPS.\r"

  ".W": "TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (LT or TNF-beta) are structurally related cytokines that share several proinflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. The shared biologic activities of TNF and LT have been attributed to their binding to a common cell surface receptor(s). We observed that rTNF enhanced the expression of MHC class I proteins on the human T cell hybridoma, II-23.D7, however LT was largely unable to regulate MHC expression. To determine the molecular basis of this disparity between LT and TNF the receptor binding characteristics of rTNF and rLT were investigated by direct and competitive radioligand assays on the II-23.D7 T hybridoma, and for comparison, anti-CD3 activated human T lymphocytes. Specific 125I-rTNF binding to the II-23.D7 line revealed a single class of sites with a Kd = 175 pM and 3000 sites/cell; anti-CD3 activated T cells exhibited specific TNF binding with similar properties. The relationship of receptor occupancy to the induction of MHC class I Ag yielded a hyperbolic curve indicating a complex relationship between rTNF binding and biologic response. LT appeared to function like a partial agonist in that rLT was 10- to 20-fold less effective than rTNF in competitively inhibiting 125I-rTNF binding on the II-23.D7 line. Scatchard type analysis revealed a single class of low affinity binding sites for 125I-rLT. No differences in the competitive binding activity of rTNF and rLT were observed on the anti-CD3-activated T cells. Receptors for rTNF and rLT were immunoprecipitated from the II-23.D7 and activated T cells with anticytokine antibodies after cross-linking of radioiodinated rTNF or rLT to intact cells by using chemical cross-linking reagents. Analysis of the cross-linked adducts by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography indicated a major adduct of 92 kDa for rTNF and 104 kDa for rLT. Enzymatic digestion with neuraminidase or V8 protease revealed a unique structure to these adducts consistent with the cross-linking of a single chain of cytokine to a cell surface glycoprotein. rTNF inhibited the formation of the 104-kDa adduct formed with 125I-rLT on the II-23.D7 line, indicating these two cytokines bind to the same receptor of approximately 80 kDa. These results suggest that the disparate activities of LT and TNF to induce MHC class I proteins on the II-23.D7 cells are, in part, associated with a modified state of a common receptor.\r"

A significant IL-6 activity was found in sera and ascitic fluids of cats with FIP, whereas no IL-6 activity was detected in sera from healthy cats. In these FIP cats, IL-6 activity in ascitic fluids was significantly higher than that in sera. Peritoneal exudate cells from FIP cats were also found to release a high level of IL-6 to the culture supernatant. The ascitic IL-6 activity was eluted into the fractions corresponding to the m.w. of 30,000 to 40,000 in gel filtration, and into the fractions at the salt concentration from 0.2 to 0.3 M NaCl in anion exchange chromatography. The level of ascitic IL-6 activity was inversely correlated to serum albumin/globulin ratio in these FIP cats. These findings indicate that IL-6 accumulated in the ascites might leaked into the systemic circulation, and be linked to systemic alterations such as enhanced synthesis of Ig and acute phase proteins.\r"

Binding studies with [3H]phorbol dibutyrate (PBt2) on whole cells revealed rapid and transient activation of PKC in Jurkat, K562, and U937 cells with a maximum of phorbol ester binding at 6 min after TNF treatment. As shown by Scatchard analysis, the TNF-induced increase of [3H]PBt2 binding reflected increments of phorbol ester binding site numbers rather than greater binding affinities. Upon subfractionation of TNF-treated U937 cells a transient increase of PBt2 binding in the membrane fraction was accompanied by a long term loss of PBt2-binding in the cytosol, indicating a TNF-induced translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane. With histone III-S as a substrate, the determination of specific PKC activity revealed similar kinetics of PKC translocation in U937 cells. TNF also induced PKC translocation in K562 and Jurkat cells. However, although TNF caused long term down-regulation of cytosolic PKC activity in U937 cells, the cytosolic PKC activity only transiently decreased in both Jurkat and K562 cells and then recovered to near basal levels. In the human nonmalignant fibroblast cell line CCD18, PKC was not activated by TNF. Our data suggest that PKC activation may play a major role in TNF signal transduction in some, but not all target cells.\r"

C4BP functions as a cofactor to factor I in the degradation of C4b and accelerates the decay rate of the C4b2a complex. We now demonstrate that C4b contains a binding site for C4BP, which is localized on the alpha'-chain of C4b. SDS-PAGE of C C4 and C4b both under reducing and nonreducing conditions was followed by a radiolabeled C4BP ligand blotting procedure. It was demonstrated that the C4BP binding site on C4b is localized on the alpha'-chain. In addition, we found C4BP binding to the alpha-chain of C4, which suggests that the binding site for C4BP becomes available after reduction of the C4 molecule. Direct binding of C4BP to the alpha- and alpha'-chains of C4 and C4b was demonstrated in a radio-labeled C4BP binding assay with the reduced and alkylated isolated chains. mAb against the alpha'-chain of C4b were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for their ability to block the binding of 125I-C4BP to C4b. Two mAb specific for the alpha'-chain of C4b were found that completely abolished C4BP binding to intact C4b. Other mAb recognizing both the alpha- and alpha'-chain of C4 and C4b demonstrated only minor inhibitory effect on the binding of C4BP to C4b. In conclusion, we have localized the C4BP binding site on the alpha'-chain of C4b and have demonstrated that this binding can be inhibited by mAb specific for the alpha'-chain.\r"

  ".W": "Immunization with recombinant human pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E2, the major autoantigen of primary biliary cirrhosis, readily induces a vigorous murine antibody response but does not generate hepatic disease. To determine the fine specificity of this response, 18 mAb were generated from three strains of mice and the reactive epitopes mapped. An initial examination of mAb suggested that they behaved similarly to the antimitochondrial autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) because i) all polyclonal antisera and 2 of 18 mAb reacted with all species of mammalian PDH-E2 examined including mouse PDH-E2, ii) 15 of 18 mAb inhibited PDH enzyme function, and iii) the reactivity of mAb toward rPDH-E2 were blocked by PBC sera. However, fine examination of the reactive sequences of the PDH-E2 complex revealed that antibodies identical to those in PBC patients were not produced by experimental immunization. In contrast to PBC, none of the mAb or murine polyclonal sera were able to react with protein X, a lipoic acid-containing component of the PDH complex previously shown to cross-react with PDH-E2 when probed with PBC sera. Although the epitopes for 12 mAb were localized within the inner lipoyl domain, none reacted with mouse PDH-E2 or cross-reacted with the outer lipoyl domain as observed in PBC. In addition, the epitopes of the two mAb which did react with all mammalian species of mitochondria were not localized within the PBC epitope. These findings indicate the highly immunogenic nature of the inner lipoyl domain of PDH-E2. The inability to elicit antibodies of the same specificity in mice, considered together with the highly localized autoantibody response in humans, suggests that antimitochondrial autoantibodies are most likely the result of specific breakdown of tolerance to a unique autoepitope.\r"

Immunization of lupus mice with mAb 3E10 inhibited production of native anti-DNA antibodies, suppressed development of lupus kidney disease (nephritis), and induced production of anti-anti-DNA (anti-Id) antibodies. mAb 1C7 bound F(ab')2 fragments of mAb 3E10, and it bound other murine anti-DNA mAb, but not murine mAb or polyclonal serum antibodies unreactive with DNA. Moreover, binding of mAb 1C7 anti-Id to mAb 3E10 was inhibited by DNA, suggesting anti-Id binding within or near the binding site for DNA. Furthermore, mAb 1C7 bound serum IgG immunoglobulins from 9/12 patients with lupus nephritis and serum anti-DNA antibodies compared to only 3/12 SLE patients with comparable serum levels of anti-DNA antibodies, but without nephritis (p = 0.04), and only 1/53 SLE patients without serum anti-DNA antibodies, 0/49 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 1/47 healthy subjects (p less than 0.001). These results provide evidence that mAb 1C7 identifies a conserved Id associated with anti-DNA antibodies in murine and human SLE and may be useful as a structural probe to characterize pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies in SLE.\r"

The intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for this effect, however, are unknown. The present studies demonstrate that LPS induces TNF transcripts in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Because previous studies have demonstrated that eicosanoids are involved in the regulation of TNF gene expression in these cells, we examined the effects of LPS on activation of the arachidonic acid cascade. The results demonstrate that LPS stimulates phospholipase A2 activity and the hydrolysis of both 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and 1-steroyl 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, there was no detectable effect of LPS on activation of protein kinase C. We also demonstrate that inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity with bromophenacyl bromide or quinacrine blocks the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS. These findings suggested that LPS induces TNF gene expression through formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indeed, similar results were obtained with mellitin, a known activator of phospholipase A2 and eicosanoid production. Previous studies have also suggested that TNF mRNA levels are increased in HL-60 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and, in the present work inhibitors of this enzyme blocked LPS-induced TNF expression. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase metabolite, PGE2, as well as dibutyryl cAMP, inhibited the induction of TNF transcripts by LPS. Taken together, these results suggest that LPS induces TNF gene expression through activation of phospholipase A2 and that the level of this induction is regulated by activity of the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways.\r"

  ".U": "90203603\r", 
  ".W": "Signaling via the alpha-beta T cell Ag receptor (Ti)-CD3 complex is a complicated event that implicates several protein kinases, most notably protein kinase C (PKC). We have recently identified a serine kinase in T lymphocytes with the following characteristics: molecular mass 43 kDa, in vitro substrate affinity for microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) with a preference for Mn2+ during the catalytic reaction, and elution from DEAE resin over a salt range 100 to 200 mM NaCl. This kinase is activated in a rapidly reversible fashion during ligation of CD3/Ti by a process which involves prior phosphorylation; in vitro exposure of activated 43-kDa MAP-2 kinase (MAP-K) to an immobilized phosphatase abrogated its kinase activity. We now show that a MAP-2K response could also be obtained during treatment with mAb to Ti and the specific PKC agonist, PMA. Although the kinetics of the former response was rapidly reversible, PMA elicited a more prolonged response. The dose responsiveness for PMA was similar to the requirements for PKC activation in intact lymphocytes. Moreover, as with PKC, we found that the CD3-induced MAP-2K response could be further enhanced by using a second layer cross-linking antibody. The specificity of CD3/Ti in the Jurkat cell response is demonstrated by the fact that OKT-11(CD2) and anti-CD4 mAb did not stimulate a MAP-2K response. It was also not possible to elicit a response in a Jurkat cell mutant that lacks surface expression of CD3 and Ti. The specificity of PKC in these events was further explored with the cell permeant diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, and the nonagonist phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate: whereas the former was an effective inducer of the MAP-2K response, the latter failed to yield any stimulation. Prior exposure of Jurkat cells to 100 mM PMA for 24 h eliminated greater than 60% of the MAP-2K response during anti-CD3 treatment. This response could also be inhibited in dose-dependent fashion by prior treatment of Jurkat cells with the potent PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl) 2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride. Although a Ca2(+)-ionophore failed to synergize with PMA at inducing a MAP-2K response, depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA abrogated anti-CD3 responsiveness. The events culminating in MAP-2K activation were slightly inhibited in the presence of cholera toxin but not pertussis toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Zymosan (Z) and its major insoluble carbohydrate component beta-linked glucan activate human neutrophils (PMN) through a trypsin-sensitive recognition mechanism. This mechanism is believed to involve the PMN CR3R. Both Z and glucan generated dose and time-dependent release of the secondary lysosomal granule marker vitamin B12 binding protein, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and superoxide from PMN and were phagocytosed with similar dose-dependent kinetics. The PMN superoxide and LTB4 responses to glucan; however, were consistently greater than those to the same doses of Z. The phagocytosis of both particles was significantly reduced after partial digestion with beta-laminarinase but not beta-glucosidase or alpha-mannosidase suggesting a recognition mechanism dependent on intact beta-1,3-glucosidic bonds in both particles. TNF-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) promoted a time- and dose-dependent increase in the expression of PMN CR3 up to 60 min. The increased expression of CR3 was paralleled by the release of the secondary lysosomal granule marker vitamin B12-binding protein. This granule contains a population of CR3R in its boundary membrane and it is the fusion of this membrane with the plasma membrane that may represent the mechanism by which CR3 expression is increased. Preincubation of PMN with 10(-9)M rhTNF-alpha augmented phagocytosis, LTB4, and superoxide generation by PMN in response to activation by Z. In contrast, none of the responses to glucan was significantly increased after incubation with rhTNF-alpha. These differences suggest a lack of absolute homology between the recognition mechanisms for zymosan and glucan and that there is a component of the recognition mechanism for zymosan that is independent of that for glucan and is up-regulated after rhTNF-alpha pretreatment.\r"

The present studies were carried out to determine the role of the L-arginine-dependent macrophage effector function on the microbiostatic effects of activated macrophages on the obligate intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. A guanidino methylated derivative of L-arginine, NGmonomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMA), a competitive inhibitor of the L-arginine-dependent effector pathway, virtually abolished the normally potent microbiostatic effect of macrophages for Toxoplasma gondii after activation of the macrophages in vitro by IFN-gamma and LPS or in vivo by i.p. injection of killed Corynebacterium parvum. Addition of supplemental L-arginine to the culture medium overcame the capacity of NGMMA to block activated macrophage-mediated microbiostasis of Toxoplasma. The ability of NGMMA to inhibit the microbiostatic capacity of activated macrophages for Toxoplasma gondii correlated with almost total inhibition of synthesis of nitrite, nitrate, and L-citrulline from L-arginine. Therefore, as is the case for tumor target cells and C. neoformans, the synthesis of inorganic nitrogen oxides from a terminal guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine appears to be essential for murine cytotoxic activated macrophage mediated microbiostatic capacity for T. gondii.\r"

Further analysis shows that there are at least two Th epitopes within this sequence: the one close to the N-terminal (p260-273) is recognized by T cells from CBA and B6 mice while that close to the carboxyl-terminal (p270-283) is a dominant Th determinant in B10.S mice. The fine specificity of the recognition of this epitope by NP-specific T cell clones is also studied. When B10.S mice were infected intranasally or i.v. with live influenza virus, or immunized by different ways with various Ag preparations, P270-283 persistently emerged as a dominant T cell epitope. Immunization of B10.S mice with peptide p270-283 induces T cells with different in vivo functions including class II-restricted cytotoxicity, cognate help for Ag-specific antibody synthesis and delayed type hypersensitivity. This may have important implications for the understanding of the differentiation and classification of subsets of CD4+ T cells. The corresponding sequence of the NP of an equine influenza virus, A/Eq/Prague/56, which has a substitution (leucine to proline) at position 283, was not recognized by the lymph node cells from mice primed with either A/Okuda or A/Eq/Prague. However, the peptide, p270-283(E), representing this sequence induced T cell responses to both human and equine viruses. The data are discussed with respect to the development of viral vaccines.\r"

The characteristics of the interaction between L. pneumophila and differentiated HL-60 cells closely resemble those between L. pneumophila and human peripheral blood monocytes. With both cell types, C receptors and serum C mediate attachment of L. pneumophila, which are taken up by coiling phagocytosis. The replicative phagosome is lined with ribosomes; intracellular multiplication is iron-dependent; and replicating bacteria ultimately destroy the host cell. As in human monocytes, an avirulent mutant derivative of L. pneumophila Philadelphia-1, 25D, does not replicate in and is not cytopathic for differentiated HL-60 cells. Differentiated HL-60 cells therefore provide a convenient and faithful model for the study of L. pneumophila-mononuclear phagocyte interaction.\r"
