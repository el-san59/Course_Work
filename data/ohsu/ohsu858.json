Despite over a century of use in medical settings, hyperbaric oxygen remains a controversial therapy. The last 20 years have seen a clarification of the mechanism of action of hyperbaric therapy and a greater understanding of its potential benefit. However, despite the substantial evidence that hyperbaric oxygen may have a therapeutic effect in certain carefully defined disease states, many practitioners remain unaware of these findings or are concerned about using hyperbaric therapy because of the controversy it has engendered. This review examines the indications currently considered appropriate for hyperbaric oxygen and briefly evaluates animal and clinical data substantiating these indications. Areas in which the mechanism of action of hyperbaric oxygen is still not well understood, as well as possible new areas of applications, are discussed.\r"

Ambient air pollution remains of concern as a source of morbidity, particularly for susceptible populations such as persons with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiac disease and the elderly. The adverse effects of several components of indoor air pollution have been established. Environmental tobacco smoke contributes to lower-respiratory illness in infants; office workers exposed to thermophilic actinomycetes contaminating ventilation systems have developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis; and in the home, components of house dust and fungus spores may provoke asthma via immediate hypersensitivity. The evidence is less compelling for a link between other exposures and disorders of the respiratory tract. For example, formaldehyde may be responsible for provoking vague respiratory symptoms and even nasal cancers; however, the associations are unproved. Likewise, the relation between low-level exposure to asbestos and the development of lung cancer, although a concern, is not conclusively established. The clinician should be aware of practical measures for patients who inquire about air cleaning. Often, relatively simple solutions are effective. A knowledge of sources and exposures as well as an understanding of the principles of inhalation lung injury should prove useful in directing patient care.\r"

Biomechanical principles have been introduced to explain the microtrauma and macrotrauma as mechanisms of injury. Stress-induced remodeling is a useful paradigm in the study of environmentally induced disorders. The concept of environment should include psychosocial and organizational factors with respect to musculoskeletal complaints and chronic pain. Low back pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and its associated fractures, and cumulative trauma disorders are the most critical and common musculoskeletal disorders. The risk factors for low back pain have been identified, and preventive measures for reducing the chronicity of low back pain have been discussed. Preventive approaches to control or limit the fractures associated with osteoporosis and loss of bone mass are preferred to simple management of the fracture of osteoporotic patients. It can be concluded that too little or too much stress can disturb the homeostatic or the equilibrium state of health and that much remains to be researched to quantify the optimal stress levels.\r"

Nephrotoxic agents may, in fact, be responsible for some fraction of renal disease of undetermined etiology. Specific diagnosis and treatment by removal from exposure to the toxic agent is more likely in the early phase of the disorder. Measurement and characterization of proteinuria provides the most sensitive and reliable method of early detection. Increased urinary excretion of serum proteins with molecular weight in excess of 50,000, such as albumin and transferrin, is an early indicator of glomerular injury. Low-molecular-weight proteinuria (beta 2-microglobulin or retinol-binding protein) and enzymuria, particularly excretion of NAG, are sensitive indicators of renal tubular cell injury. Tests that reflect hypersensitivity reactions are often indicative of immunologically mediated nephrotoxicity but are not specific for the kidney. Cancers of the kidney and urinary bladder appear to be increasing and are most common among the socially active and affluent. Susceptibility of the urinary tract to toxicity and carcinogenicity reflect contact of excreted toxins with the epithelial cells of nephrons and urinary bladder.\r"

  ".U": "90205256\r", 
  ".W": "On the basis of current knowledge of reproductive biology and toxicology, it is apparent that chemicals affecting reproduction may elicit their effects at a number of sites in both the male and the female reproductive system. This multiplicity of targets is attributable to the dynamic nature of the reproductive system, in which the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is controlled by precise positive and negative feedback mechanisms among its components. Interference by a xenobiotic at any level in either the male or the female reproductive system may ultimately impair hypothalamic or pituitary function. Normal gonadal processes such as spermatogenesis or oogenesis, ejaculation or ovulation, hormone production by Leydig or granulosa cells, and the structure or function of the accessory reproductive structures (e.g., epididymis, fallopian tube) also appear vulnerable to xenobiotics. The reproductive system is a complex one that requires local and circulating hormones for control. This brief review illustrates a system for characterizing the mechanism of action of reproductive toxicants, as well as for defining the sites available for disruption of reproduction. Unfortunately, at present, data addressing the actual vulnerability of reproduction are sorely lacking. However, when experiments have been conducted and combined with epidemiologic data or clinical observation, it has been possible to demonstrate impairment of reproductive processes by xenobiotics. The role of environmental exposure to xenobiotics in the increase in infertility that has been observed remains to be defined.\r"

At present, however, there is no evidence that the immune or hematopoietic systems of the general population have been compromised by xenobiotics via environmental exposure. Nonetheless, these examples and our current knowledge about the pathogenesis of disease support the possibility that chemical-induced damage to the immune system may be associated with potential pathological conditions, some of which may become detectable only after a long latency. Likewise, exposure to immunotoxic xenobiotics might represent additional risk to individuals with already fragile immune systems (e.g., in malnutrition, infancy, old age). However, it is important to be cautious when attempting to extrapolate meaningful conclusions from experimental data or isolated epidemiologic studies to risk assessment for low-level human exposure.\r"

Occupational diseases affect all organ systems and include pulmonary disease, musculoskeletal injuries, occupational cancer, traumatic injuries, occupationally induced cardiovascular disease, disorders of reproduction, neurotoxic disorders, noise-induced hearing loss, dermatologic conditions, and psychological disorders. Occupational diseases may be very difficult to diagnose. Pathognomonic signs and symptoms are rare; most occupational diseases are clinically indistinguishable from disease of other etiologies. Diagnosis is complicated further by the long latency typical between a toxic occupational exposure and the appearance of illness. Further, there is widespread lack of information on the toxicity of most chemical substances in use in American workplaces, and workers frequently are not informed of the nature or the hazards of the materials with which they work. The occupational history is the principal clinical instrument for the diagnosis of occupational disease. All patients should undergo at least a brief occupational history that inquires about the current job, including both industry and occupation, the longest-held previous jobs, and any toxic occupational exposures to chemicals, fumes, gases, dust, noise, or radiation. Proper diagnosis of occupational disease permits proper treatment of the affected patient and also provides a basis for recognition of other similarly employed persons who may also be at risk of toxic exposure. Occupational diseases are highly preventable. Prevention is most efficiently achieved by removing hazardous materials from the workplace and replacing them with less hazardous substances. Other approaches to prevention include ventilation, alteration in work practices, and use of personal protective equipment. Physicians in the United States are for the most part not well trained to recognize occupational illness. At the same time, there is a great lack of qualified specialists in occupational medicine. The majority of care of patients with occupational disease will therefore continue to be the responsibility of primary care physicians, and these physicians must become more highly attuned to the possibility that their patients may have diseases induced by toxic exposures encountered at work. The development of a heightened sensitivity of primary care providers to occupationally induced disease is an urgent priority.\r"

This state can occur in all individuals, but the very young and the elderly are more susceptible. Environmental and industrially generated high ambient temperature can place further stress on aged individuals and workers, resulting in a complex symptom picture. Morbidity and death may result from such exposures. Causative factors have been identified. Noise exposure induces hearing losses above those secondary to the aging process. Psychophysiological effects during noise exposure are considered to result from the sympathetic activity secondary to a general stress reaction. Vibration from the use of power tools results in Raynaud's phenomenon. However, modification of power tools has reduced the symptoms associated with vibration exposure. Termination of exposure to vibration appears eventually to reduce symptoms related to white-finger spasms. Interaction between these stressors has not been clarified because of the complex effects of each. The need for additional information about the response to these stressors is evident.\r"

The passage of the Walsh-Healey Act in 1936 led to the need to develop exposure limits (standards) for contaminants in industrial operations. During the 1960s, the environmental movement emerged, resulting in various laws to protect the public health beginning around 1970. The interplay of factors necessary to prevent environmentally induced diseases is complex, but standards are considered to be objective indicators of successful preventive measures or strategies. The roles or activities of various entities in establishing these standards are critical and include research, education, health professionals, professional organizations, and the government.\r"

The combined results demonstrate positive, continuous, and apparently independent associations, with no significant heterogeneity of effect among different studies. Within the range of DBP studied (about 70-110 mm Hg), there was no evidence of any \"threshold\" below which lower levels of DBP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD. Previous analyses have described the uncorrected associations of DBP measured just at \"baseline\" with subsequent disease rates. But, because of the diluting effects of random fluctuations in DBP, these substantially underestimate the true associations of the usual DBP (ie, an individual's long-term average DBP) with disease. After correction for this \"regression dilution\" bias, prolonged differences in usual DBP of 5, 7.5, and 10 mm Hg were respectively associated with at least 34%, 46%, and 56% less stroke and at least 21%, 29%, and 37% less CHD. These associations are about 60% greater than in previous uncorrected analyses. (This regression dilution bias is quite general, so analogous corrections to the relations of cholesterol to CHD or of various other risk factors to CHD or to other diseases would likewise increase their estimated strengths.) The DBP results suggest that for the large majority of individuals, whether conventionally \"hypertensive\" or \"normotensive\", a lower blood pressure should eventually confer a lower risk of vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "There are 14 unconfounded randomised trials of antihypertensive drugs (chiefly diuretics or beta-blockers): total 37,000 individuals, mean treatment duration 5 years, mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) difference 5-6 mm Hg. In prospective observational studies, a long-term difference of 5-6 mm Hg in usual DBP is associated with about 35-40% less stroke and 20-25% less coronary heart disease (CHD). For those dying in the trials, the DBP difference had persisted only 2-3 years, yet an overview showed that vascular mortality was significantly reduced (2p less than 0.0002); non-vascular mortality appeared unchanged. Stroke was reduced by 42% SD 6 (95% confidence interval 35-50%; 289 vs 484 events, 2p less than 0.0001), suggesting that virtually all the epidemiologically expected stroke reduction appears rapidly. CHD was reduced by 14% SD 5 (95% CI 4-22%; 671 vs 771 events, 2p less than 0.01), suggesting that just over half the epidemiologically expected CHD reduction appears rapidly. Although this significant CHD reduction could well be worthwhile, its size remains indefinite for most circumstances (though beta-blockers after myocardial infarction are of substantial benefit). At present, therefore, a sufficiently high risk of stroke (perhaps because of age, blood pressure, or, in particular, history of cerebrovascular disease) may be the clearest indication for antihypertensive treatment.\r"

Five parameters were evaluated: deglutition, mastication, cosmesis, diet, and the use of dentures. Deglutition was not improved in patients who had mandibular continuity restored. Problems with deglutition were related to soft tissue resection. Mastication was poorer in the reconstructed group due to scarring, loss of the muscles of mastication, and inhibition of compensatory mandibular motion. Cosmesis was improved in patients who had immediate restoration of mandibular continuity. Cosmesis was not improved in patients with delayed mandibular reconstruction due to previous scarring. Prosthetic rehabilitation was poor in both groups of patients. Reconstructed patients had a greater number of hospitalizations due to management of, or complications from reconstructive surgical procedures. The results of this study suggests that restoration of mandibular continuity does not enhance the functional rehabilitation of the majority of patients with oral-pharyngeal malignancy.\r"

  ".U": "90205595\r", 
  ".W": "Although polymicrobial bacteremia has been described in several previous series, there has been no recent study of patients using rigorous statistical analysis. Our objective was to characterize a present-day patient population with polymicrobial bacteremia and to define factors prognostic of survival. Polymicrobial bacteremia accounted for 6% of all positive blood cultures at a university hospital and a Veterans Administration hospital over a 2 1/2 year period in the late 1980s. The majority of these patients were elderly with significant underlying diseases, notably malignancies, and 56% of all episodes were nosocomially acquired. Enterobacteriaceae have remained the most common organisms, though the frequency of gram-positive cocci isolated has increased compared to older studies. Gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft-tissue sources were the most common, although the incidence of infections due to central venous catheters appeared to be increasing. The source of 25% of bacteremia was not identified despite newer diagnostic techniques. By univariate analysis, mortality, which was 36% overall, correlated with thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalopathy, severity of underlying disease, hemolysis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, use of steroids, renal insufficiency, institution, presence of central lines, and nosocomial acquisition. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, mortality was predicted by respiratory failure, severity of underlying disease, and hemolysis. We conclude that polymicrobial bacteremia remains an important entity in the present-day hospitalized population, with an increasing frequency of gram-positive organisms and catheter sources, and a large proportion of undiagnosed etiologies.\r"

Azathioprine alone is minimally efficacious and probably not worth the bother and risk. Cyclophosphamide alone is too toxic. Although cyclosporine A may slow the rate of deterioration in chronic progressive MS, adverse effects may limit its use outside major centers. Gamma interferon provokes exacerbations and should not be used. We do not recommend copolymer-1, alpha or beta interferon, monoclonal antibodies, plasmapheresis, and total lymphoid irradiation except in well-designed experimental protocols. Combination therapy of adrenal cortical steroids (ACS) with other immunosuppressants (cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine) merits further study. We think \"pulse\" synthetic ACS therapy has advantages over corticotropin and will become the \"standard of care\" for exacerbations. We also would try it for chronic progression. Even then, with the pulse treatment we still must determine the optimum dose, route, duration, and need for \"taper.\"\r"

Integrative areas of the basal forebrain play a crucial role, as does interaction with cholinergic and aminergic areas of the brain stem. AD, which affects a wide range of structures and functions, alters sleep in a manner distinguishable from depressive pseudodementia and may involve changes in autonomic function. Sleep apnea occurs with a high incidence in patients with AD, and the possibility should be explored that treating sleep apnea might be beneficial to their cognitive and affective status. Long-acting hypnotics can adversely affect daytime functioning. This might occur because of either direct effects on structures mediating sleep and cognition or, alternatively, exacerbation of sleep-related respiratory dysfunction. Studies of the benzodiazepine receptor complex may lead to the development of new drugs to aid sleep and wakefulness.\r"

The rapid systemic clearance of levodopa underlies the \"short duration\" response to the drug, which is progressively unmasked as PD progresses and central dopamine synthetic and storage capacity can no longer buffer fluctuations in plasma levodopa levels. Dyskinesias may be considered a secondary pharmacodynamic consequence of such pharmacokinetically induced oscillations in brain dopamine levels. Therapeutic approaches aimed at stabilizing brain dopaminergic activity include the use of slowly releasing galenic formulations of levodopa, synthetic dopamine agonists of long-lasting biologic activity, and drugs such as deprenyl that act as \"dopamine extenders.\" It remains to be seen whether early use of such treatment approaches will reduce the prevalence of motor response fluctuations, which are one of the most disabling complications of long-term treatment of PD.\r"

An increased understanding of neurotransmitter metabolism and function in patients with chronic autonomic failure has led to a variety of rational therapeutic approaches. Much progress has been achieved in the management of orthostatic hypotension, the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. Treatment of the parkinsonian features in MSA is limited by pharmacologic sensitivity and autonomic failure.

  ".W": "About a third of patients with ovarian cancer present with localized disease; despite surgical resection, up to half the tumors recur. Since it has not been established whether adjuvant treatment can benefit such patients, we conducted two prospective, randomized national cooperative trials of adjuvant therapy in patients with localized ovarian carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages Ia to IIc). All patients underwent surgical resection plus comprehensive staging and, 18 months later, surgical re-exploration. In the first trial, 81 patients with well-differentiated or moderately well differentiated cancers confined to the ovaries (Stages Iai and Ibi) were assigned to receive either no chemotherapy or melphalan (0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for five days, repeated every four to six weeks for up to 12 cycles). After a median follow-up of more than six years, there were no significant differences between the patients given no chemotherapy and those treated with melphalan with respect to either five-year disease-free survival (91 vs. 98 percent; P = 0.41) or overall survival (94 vs. 98 percent; P = 0.43). In the second trial, 141 patients with poorly differentiated Stage I tumors or with cancer outside the ovaries but limited to the pelvis (Stage II) were randomly assigned to treatment with either melphalan (in the same regimen as above) or a single intraperitoneal dose of 32P (15 mCi) at the time of surgery. In this trial (median follow-up, greater than 6 years) the outcomes for the two treatment groups were similar with respect to five-year disease-free survival (80 percent in both groups) and overall survival (81 percent with melphalan vs. 78 percent with 32P; P = 0.48). We conclude that in patients with localized ovarian cancer, comprehensive staging at the time of surgical resection can serve to identify those patients (as defined by the first trial) who can be followed without adjuvant chemotherapy. The remaining patients with localized ovarian cancer should receive adjuvant therapy, and with adjuvant melphalan or intraperitoneal 32P should have a five-year disease-free survival of about 80 percent.\r"

To compare the efficacy and side effects of ivermectin with those of diethylcarbamazine, the standard antifilarial treatment, we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in 40 South Indian men with lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: a single low dose of ivermectin (mean [+/- SE], 21.3 +/- 0.7 micrograms per kilogram of body weight; n = 13) followed by placebo for 12 days; a single high dose of ivermectin (mean, 126.2 +/- 3.7 micrograms per kilogram; n = 13) followed by placebo for 12 days; or diethylcarbamazine for 13 days (6 mg per kilogram per day for 12 days preceded by 3 mg per kilogram for 1 day; n = 14). Eleven patients were initially assigned to receive placebo and after five days were reassigned to one of the three treatment groups. At day 12 there was complete clearance of microfilariae from the blood in all 26 men who took ivermectin and in 11 of the 14 men who took diethylcarbamazine. At six months the numbers of detectable microfilariae (as a percentage of the pretreatment values) were 18.3 percent after low-dose ivermectin and 19.5 percent after high-dose ivermectin, as compared with 6.0 percent after diethylcarbamazine (P less than 0.05). The side effects were confined to the first five days and were similar in the three treatment groups. We conclude that in lymphatic filariasis, the clinical response to a single dose of ivermectin compares favorably with that after the standard 12-day course of diethylcarbamazine. Given the practical advantages of single-dose administration, ivermectin should become a useful medication for the control of bancroftian filariasis.\r"

  ".U": "90206045\r", 
  ".W": "Members of a family of murine octamer-binding proteins interact specifically with the octamer motif, a transcription regulatory element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of many genes. Oct-4 is a maternally expressed protein that is also present in the pre-implantation mouse embryo. Although many regulatory proteins are expressed in post-implantation embryos, transcription factors regulating pre-implantation processes have remained elusive. The Oct-4 gene is therefore a prime candidate for an early developmental control gene. Here we report the complementary DNA cloning of the mouse Oct-4 gene, and the characterization of the encoded protein(s) by sequential in vitro transcription, translation, DNA-binding and protease-clipping analysis. Deletion analysis shows that the DNA-binding activity is mediated by a POU domain encoded in an open reading frame corresponding to a 324-amino-acid protein. Sequence comparison with known POU domains reveals that Oct-4 is a novel member of the POU-family.\r"

  ".W": "The discovery of RNA enzymes has, for the first time, provided a single molecule that has both genetic and catalytic properties. We have devised techniques for the mutation, selection and amplification of catalytic RNA, all of which can be performed rapidly in vitro. Here we describe how these techniques can be integrated and performed repeatedly within a single reaction vessel. This allows evolution experiments to be carried out in response to artificially imposed selection constraints. We worked with the Tetrahymena ribozyme, a self-splicing group I intron derived from the large ribosomal RNA precursor of Tetrahymena thermophila that catalyses sequence-specific phosphoester transfer reactions involving RNA substrates. It consists of 413 nucleotides, and assumes a well-defined secondary and tertiary structure responsible for its catalytic activity. We selected for variant forms of the enzyme that could best react with a DNA substrate. This led to the recovery of a mutant form of the enzyme that cleaves DNA more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. The selected molecule represents the discovery of the first RNA enzyme known to cleave single-stranded DNA specifically.\r"

  ".W": "The archaeological and hominid site of Border Cave (KwaZulu, South Africa) has a stratigraphic sequence covering the Middle and Later Stone Ages (MSA and LSA). It has been proposed that four hominid specimens recovered there (BC1 and BC2 of uncertain provenance, and BC3 and BC5 recovered from MSA layers) represent very early examples of anatomically modern humans, supporting an early late-Pleistocene appearance of modern Homo sapiens in Africa. This early appearance, however, has been questioned, largely because of doubts about the stratigraphic positions associated with the specimens and because of the lack of a reliable chronology for the stratigraphic sequence. We now report on the first comprehensive radiometric dating analysis of Border Cave, using electron spin resonance (ESR) on teeth within sediment layers. BC3 is likely to be approximately 70-80 kyr old, and BC5, 50-65 kyr old. BC1 and BC2 are almost certainly less than 90 kyr old. These results, although younger than some age estimates, support the early occurrence of anatomically modern humans at Border Cave. In addition, our results suggest that the Howiesons Poort lithic industry (approximately 45-75 kyr) and the MSA-LSA transition (approximately 35 kyr) are younger than often believed.\r"

The genes for several of the proteins involved in blood pressure homeostasis have been cloned and characterized, including those of the renin-angiotensin system, which plays a central part in blood pressure control. Here we describe the introduction of the mouse Ren-2 renin gene into the genome of the rat and demonstrate that expression of this gene causes severe hypertension. These transgenic animals represent a model for hypertension in which the genetic basis for the disease is known. Further, as the transgenic animals do not overexpress active renin in the kidney and have low levels of active renin in their plasma, they also provide a new model for low-renin hypertension.\r"

Although an important general feature of the reverse transcription pathway, encapsidation has been carefully studied only for retroviruses. We have now examined the encapsidation reaction in a family of enveloped DNA viruses that replicate by reverse transcription--the hepatitis B viruses (hepadnaviruses). Our results indicate that the hepadnaviral polymerase (P) gene product is required for RNA packaging, and that the encapsidation function of the enzyme can be separated from its DNA polymerase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a role for polymerase gene products in this step of the reverse transcription pathway.\r"

This sequence is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, TTF I, which mediates the termination of transcription by RNA polymerase I (pol I). Subsequently, the ends of the primary transcripts are trimmed by 10 nucleotides in a sequence-dependent 3'-terminal processing reaction. We have now investigated whether TTF I bound to its target sequence will block elongation by any RNA polymerase by steric hindrance, or whether it is specific for elongation by pol I. The results demonstrate that TTF I directs transcription termination with RNA polymerase I from species as divergent as mouse and yeast, but fails to affect elongation by heterologous polymerases (eukaryotic RNA polymerases II and III, Escherichia coli or bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase). By contrast, purified lac repressor bound to its operator sequence stops elongation by both RNA polymerase I and II.\r"

  ".W": "A TANDEM repeat of the sequence Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser-Tyr has been found at the C terminus in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (refs 1-5) with, for example, 26 units in yeast and 52 in mammals. By removal of this 'tail', it has been shown that 11-23 units are necessary for the normal functioning of the polymerase. The functional role of the repeat is however, unclear, although it has been proposed that it binds to transcription factors. As discussed in an earlier paper, the repeat unit contains two Ser-Pro sequences which seem to be related to a DNA-binding unit found in histones, Ser-Pro-Lys-Lys, and to the Ser-Pro-X-X motif which is often found in gene regulatory proteins and which, it has been proposed, is also a DNA-binding unit. Here, I show that the repeat does indeed bind DNA and present evidence that it does so by the intercalation of tyrosine residues. These experiments involved synthetic peptides containing one or two repeat units. As the sequence Ser-Pro-X-X (where X represents any amino acid) has a strong tendency to assume a special beta-turn, a model of the unit composed of two such beta-turns was made and compared with the structure of the drug Triostin A which is known to intercalate into DNA. Two tyrosine side chains of the repeat overlap well with two quinoxaline rings of the drug and therefore, the model can provide a good explanation of the experimental results.\r"

  ".W": "The RNA of viroids and virusoids in plants, and the RNA transcripts of some tandemly repeated DNA sequences in the newt, can undergo self-catalysed cleavage to generate RNA with 5'-OH and 2',3'-cyclic-phosphate termini. These catalytic RNAs, or ribozymes, form a stem-loop secondary structure called a 'hammerhead' in which the catalytic (ribozyme) and substrate sequences are brought close together. Catalytically active mimics of hammerhead ribozymes can be readily made using oligoribonucleotides. Consequently, hammerhead analogues in which certain ribonucleotides are replaced by different ones have been constructed both to identify consensus residues required for cleavage activity and to determine the details of the cleavage mechanism. But these ribonucleotide-replacements tend to alter the conformation of the hammerhead by changing hydrogen-bonding and stacking potential at the position of substitution. We have now constructed structurally less-disrupted hammerhead analogues in which deoxyribonucleotides, which lack 2'-OH groups, are substituted for ribonucleotides. These mixed RNA-DNA polymers were synthesized using a strategy for the chemical synthesis of RNA that is compatible with DNA synthesis. Analysis of the cleavage products of several of these hammerhead analogues confirms the involvement in the reaction of the 2'-OH adjacent to the cleavage site in the substrate, and demonstrates that some 2'-OH groups in the catalytic region strongly affect activity. The results also indicate that the three-dimensional structure producing nucleic acid-type catalysis is not restricted to RNA.\r"

In 1535, he was appointed professor of medicine at the University of Marburg. During the next year he held two public dissections, and in 1536 he was the author of the first text illustrating a Galenic dissection of the human brain. An expanded edition of this early book, the Anatomiae pars prior, was published in 1537. These texts represented an important transition from the dogma of medieval scholasticism to the precise observations of Vesalius. The books depicted the brain in eight figures, with four additional plates describing the skull, skull base, and cranial sutures. Detailed illustrations of the dura mater, cerebral cortex, and posterior fossa structures with clear, but inaccurate, relationship to the cranial nerves demonstrated Dryander's reliance on his own dissections. In 1542, he published a translated edition of Mundinus' anatomy. As was common at that time, the text plagiarized a portion of Vesalius' Tabulae sex, which resulted in the famous anatomist's anger. Despite this, Dryander continued to write on medical subjects as well as mathematics and astrology until his death in 1560. Because he was a progenitor of rational scientific thought, his earlier books represented an important advance in the progression to modern anatomic description and illustration.\r"

  ".U": "90206350\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past 2 decades, a number of studies have demonstrated that amino acids act as precursors for the biosynthesis of a variety of neuroactive compounds, including catecholamines and indoleamines. For example, the aromatic amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor for serotonin biosynthesis. Based on this observed precursor relationship, dietary tryptophan supplementation is used to treat a number of neurologic disorders attributed to alterations in serotoninergic neurotransmission. Recent studies have revealed that, in addition to serotonin, a number of neuroactive compounds, the kynurenines, are metabolities of tryptophan. Of these, perhaps the most important is quinolinic acid, a neurotoxin that acts at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and whose precursor responsiveness to tryptophan far exceeds that of serotonin. In the central nervous system, kynurenines, and in particular quinolinic acid, may modulate excitatory amino acid transmission, and may act as neurotoxic agents implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurologic diseases.\r"

A space-occupying substance of high molecular weight (sodium hyaluronate), injected into the anterior chamber, raised the intraocular pressure of these patients to 24 mm Hg. Within 24 to 72 hours the uvea flattened, and later the retina settled completely. Satisfactory clinical stability has continued in the follow-up period. Because a rheologic study of the aqueous humor revealed hyposecretion and hypotony in the apparently unaffected fellow eye, it is suggested that a primary bulbar hypotony can trigger a uveal effusion syndrome in an otherwise normal-sized eye with no structural abnormality.\r"

Macrophages were present in the subretinal space of day 3 and day 8 lesions. These IL-1-containing cells were distributed about the area of rupture of Bruch's membrane and were quite common in lesions taken 3 days following laser treatment. While still apparent, the number was decreased at 8 days, and none were found 14 days after laser treatment. The temporal and spatial distribution of IL-1-staining macrophages paralleled the development of SRN, suggesting a relationship between the presence of activated macrophages and the initiation of neovascularization in this model.\r"

Twelve patients presented to the emergency department of The Children's Hospital of Denver over a two-year period; we found an additional 13 in a review of the literature. A combination of two disorders produced stridor and wheezing in six patients, with one condition in the extrathoracic airway and one in the intrathoracic airway. The remaining 19 patients had single lesions, nine with obstruction of the extrathoracic airway and 10 with obstruction of the intrathoracic airway. The causes of stridor and wheezing in these 19 patients fell into three general categories: (1) congenital lesion affecting the airway (eight patients); (2) foreign body in the airway or esophagus (nine patients); and (3) acquired lesion affecting the airway (two patients). All eight patients with congenital lesions developed symptoms by four months of age. All nine patients with an airway or esophageal foreign body were between five and 30 months of age. The history may be misleading, and the physical examination often cannot discriminate among the various likely diagnoses. However, the addition of four plain x-ray views (lateral neck, posteroanterior and lateral chest, and forced expiratory chest) located the site of obstruction in 18 of 25 patients. Barium swallow identified the two patients with vascular rings. Four patients underwent endoscopy to determine the site of obstruction. We make recommendations for evaluation of these patients.\r"

Thus, being familiar with a large variety of emergency therapeutic options, including the use of CBAs, is important. In many medical centers, CBAs have already become the first line of drugs for converting PSVT into normal sinus rhythm (verapamil) and for ameliorating malignant hypertension (nifedipine). The increasing evidence that nimodipine effectively decreases the cerebral damage after head trauma and intracranial hemorrhage will also probably turn this compound into one of the drugs readily available in the emergency department. CBAs will continue to be thoroughly investigated, allowing more new therapeutic applications in pediatric emergency care.\r"

After the acute attack has been managed, a thorough investigation of possible causes should be made and the patient referred to a specialist, if indicated.

Although direct rectal examination remains the standard clinical tool for staging prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasound appears to be about twice as sensitive for detection. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has replaced prostate-specific acid phosphatase as a serum tumor marker for prostate cancer. When used in conjunction with measurement of prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound, PSA values may identify patients at increased risk for occult cancer. Use of transrectal ultrasound and PSA values has also improved the accuracy of clinical staging. Modifications in the technique of radical prostatectomy have minimized the morbidity associated with this procedure, making it a more attractive therapeutic option in patients with localized prostate cancer. In patients with metastatic disease, total androgen blockade is an option that appears superior to standard hormonal therapy.\r"

Cells in monolayer culture were pulse-labeled with [2-3H]glycerol, and after different periods of chase with unlabeled glycerol, the movement of triacyl[3H]glycerol through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and the incorporation into nascent VLDL and cytoplasmic triacylglycerol-rich vesicles (TGRVs) were determined. Initially, newly synthesized triacyl[3H]glycerol is tightly associated with the ER. Movement from the ER of triacyl[3H]glycerol destined for cytoplasmic storage (as TGRVs) is extremely rapid and virtually complete within 8 min of chase. After 8 min of chase, triacyl[3H]glycerol lost from organelles of the secretory system was accounted for entirely as triacyl[3H]glycerol secreted as VLDL. Comparison of the rates of movement of triacyl[3H]glycerol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein II, and apolipoprotein A-I through the ER and Golgi and of their secretion in nascent VLDL suggests that assembly of triacyglycerol with apolipoproteins occurs in the Golgi. Experiments with permeabilized hepatocytes supplemented with cytosol show that newly synthesized triacyl[3H]glycerol and [3H]phospholipid moves from the ER through the full-density range of Golgi elements and is dependent upon supplementary ATP.\r"

SHOK cells were almost as susceptible as NIH 3T3 cells to focus formation by many oncogenes, including v-raf, v-Ha-ras, v-Ki-ras, or activated c-Ha-ras. The susceptibility of SHOK to focus formation was higher than that of NIH 3T3 for v-mos but was lower for v-fps, v-fgr, v-src, v-sis, and v-abl. When DNAs extracted from 27 human and murine tumors were tested for focus formation, 5 DNAs were positive in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas 9 were positive in SHOK cells at the primary transfection. Using SHOK cells as recipients of tumor cellular DNA, we isolated another oncogene and a c-Ki-ras2 gene mutated at codon 146 that were difficult to detect in NIH 3T3 cells. SHOK cells have a low rate of spontaneous transformation, produce easily distinguishable foci, and maintain a stable karyotype in transformed cells. In addition to being useful for the screening of human tumor DNAs, SHOK cells will be useful for the isolation of oncogenes from murine tumors because of their hamster origin.\r"

  ".U": "90207209\r", 
  ".W": "Determination of icosahedral virion capsid size can be directly studied during helper-dependent lytic development of satellite P4 because the assembly pathway specified by the P2 helper virus is altered to yield smaller-sized capsids. Size determination (sid) mutations identify a P4-encoded function regulating this process. To determine whether the sid gene product is necessary and sufficient to redirect the assembly pathway, we (i) cloned the sid structural gene in a plasmid vector (pMA30) under the control of an inducible promoter and (ii) constructed a packaging substrate (pMA1), a P4 genome-sized plasmid containing only that region of P4, the cos site, necessary for encapsidation. Superinfection by P2 of a host carrying pMA30 under induced conditions resulted in a shift from large to small capsid production. P2 superinfection of a host carrying the cos plasmid pMA1 plus pMA30 under induced conditions yielded pMA1-transducing particles of P4 capsid size. These cloning-based analyses directly demonstrate that sid protein is the only P4 gene product required for small-capsid size determination. In the absence of the P2 O gene product no capsids of any size are assembled during solo infection by P2. Nevertheless, P2 Oam mutant superinfection of a host carrying pMA1 and pMA30 under induced conditions yielded small P4-sized transducing particles. We therefore propose that (i) the sid gene product competes with the O gene product to determine the assembly of small vs. large capsid sizes and (ii) both gene products probably function as temporary scaffolding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated by flow cytometric analysis the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by viable single-cell islet cells (SCICs) prepared from male and female 4- and 10-week-old nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse islets. With anti-I-Ak monoclonal antibody (specific for I-Ak,f,r,s beta and produced by clone 11-5-2), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as second-step antibody, we found that SCICs from both sexes aberrantly expressed class II MHC molecules, which was not altered after SCICs were cultured for 24 hr or 120 hr in the presence of 10 ng of recombinant murine interferon gamma per ml. Double-indirect immunofluorescence of male SCICs indicated that the expression of class II MHC molecules was a property of beta cells. Control experiments documented that macrophages and mononuclear cells did not contaminate the SCIC preparations. Coculture experiments with responder splenic CD4 T cells isolated from diabetic NOD mice and stimulator male SCICs indicated a recognition event evidenced by a 12-fold increase in proliferative response. Monoclonal antibodies to class II MHC and CD4 antigens blocked the proliferative response. Results from control autologous and allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions suggest that the responder CD4 T cells are autoreactive self-class II MHC restricted. We tentatively conclude that the ability of SCICs from both sexes of NOD mice to express class II MHC molecules as early as 4 weeks of age may represent a mechanism for targeting immune reactions to beta cells and initiate lymphocytic insulitis.\r"

We have used a plasmid DNA replication system reconstituted with purified proteins in vitro to investigate the interaction of the Tus protein with the replication fork. Purified Tus protein alone is necessary and sufficient to arrest DNA replication on ColE1-type plasmid templates containing ter sites. Tus protein-catalyzed termination depends upon the orientation of the ter site in the plasmid DNA. Nucleotide resolution mapping of the terminated nascent DNA shows that leading-strand DNA synthesis arrests at the point of contact with the Tus protein, while the final lagging-strand primer sites are 50-70 nucleotides upstream. In addition, the distribution of leading-strand arrest sites changes when the composition of the proteins on the lagging-strand side of the replication fork is altered.\r"

  ".W": "Yeast replication origins contain a DNA sequence element whose biological activity correlates with hypersensitivity to single-strand-specific nucleases in negatively supercoiled plasmids. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of plasmid topoisomers, we demonstrate that thermodynamically stable origin unwinding accounts for the nuclease hypersensitivity and, furthermore, that increased thermal energy facilitates stable origin unwinding in vitro. In living cells, increased thermal energy can suppress origin mutations that raise the free-energy cost for unwinding the nuclease-hypersensitive element. Specifically, mutational defects in autonomously replicating sequence (ARS)-mediated plasmid replication are less severe in cells grown at 30 degrees C as compared to 23 degrees C. Our findings indicate that the energetics of DNA unwinding at the nuclease-hypersensitive element are biologically important. We call the nuclease-hypersensitive sequence the DNA unwinding element (DUE) and propose that it serves as the entry site for yeast replication enzymes into the DNA helix.\r"

  ".U": "90207226\r", 
  ".W": "The dnaX gene (previously called dnaZX) of Escherichia coli has only one open reading frame for a 71-kDa polypeptide from which two distinct DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunits, tau (71 kDa) and gamma (47 kDa), are produced. To determine how the gamma subunit is generated, we examined the influence of mutations in the dnaX gene on the pattern of tau and gamma production in overproducing cells. Important structural elements in dnaX mRNA include a stretch of six adenines (nucleotides 1425-1430), a stable hairpin structure (nucleotides 1437-1466), and a UGA stop codon in a -1 frame (nucleotides 1434-1436) between the stretch of adenines and the hairpin structure. Disruption of this stop codon generates a slightly larger gamma subunit, indicative of the use of a -1 stop codon farther downstream (nucleotides 1470-1472). These results suggest that a -1 frameshift during translation allows the use of this UGA codon to terminate translation of the gamma polypeptide. The amino acid composition, sequence, and mass spectra of a C-terminal peptide from mild digestion of the purified gamma protein with endoproteinase Lys-C confirms that this frameshift occurs at either of the two lysine codons in the region of the adenine stretch. Remarkable features of this frameshifting are its high frequency (i.e., about 80% in an overproducing cell) and the striking structural similarity to the frameshifting signal responsible for expression of the pol and pro genes in many retroviruses.\r"

  ".U": "90207234\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has shown that prolonged pretreatment of a mouse anterior pituitary cell line, AtT-20 cells, with the cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) stimulates beta-endorphin release and potentiates the secretion induced by many secretagogues. Desensitization of protein kinase C (PKC) by pretreatment with phorbol ester [phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate (TPA)] for 8 hr abolished the secretion induced by TPA as well as the enhancement of TPA-induced beta-endorphin release produced by IL-1. Desensitization of PKC only partly abolished the potentiating effects of IL-1 on corticotropin-releasing factor-induced beta-endorphin secretion. In contrast, IL-1-induced beta-endorphin release was independent of PKC. We observed that treatment of AtT-20 cells with IL-1 markedly phosphorylated 19-, 20-, and 60-kDa proteins within minutes, presumably by early activation of protein kinases. Prolonged treatment with TPA, which was shown to desensitize an 87-kDa protein (a substrate for PKC), had no effect on IL-1-induced phosphorylation of 20-, 60-, and 87-kDa proteins, indicating that the phosphorylation of these proteins does not involve PKC. IL-1 does not generate cAMP in AtT-20 cells, suggesting that a cAMP-dependent protein kinase is also not involved. Prolonged treatment with IL-1 abolishes the capacity of cytokine to induce the phosphorylation of 20- and 60-kDa proteins. The presence of IL-1 was required initially only for a short time to induce late secretion in AtT-20 cells. These observations indicate that once IL-1 generates an early signal, its presence is no longer necessary for the subsequent secretion of beta-endorphin.\r"

  ".W": "The neu protooncogene (also called c-erbB2 and HER-2) undergoes oncogenic activation through a single mutation. The product of the protooncogene, p185neu, probably functions as a receptor for a peptide growth factor. To circumvent the absence of a well-characterized ligand, I generated ligand-mimicking monoclonal antibodies directed to the presumed receptor. These antibodies stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p185neu in living cells and also accelerated the rate of endocytosis and degradation of p185neu. A monovalent Fab fragment of such an antibody was ineffective, suggesting a role for receptor dimerization in signal transduction. Unlike the product of the protooncogene, the transforming mutant was not affected by the ligand-like antibodies. However, it undergoes constitutively high phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in living cells, and its turnover rate is remarkably rapid. Nevertheless, the pattern of phosphorylation of the mutant protein is similar to the one exhibited by an antibody-stimulated p185neu, suggesting that the mutation mimics activation by the antibody. These results suggest that the kinase of p185neu is under allosteric control that may involve ligand-induced dimerization of receptors. This mechanism is deregulated in the oncogenic mutant, which is functionally equivalent to ligand-stimulated receptor.\r"

Preincubation of ECs with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml) for 1 min significantly enhanced their inhibitory activity. This effect was potentiated by superoxide dismutase (60 units/ml) and reversed by oxyhemoglobin (5-10 microM), indicating that the inhibition was due to the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide). When the ECs were pretreated with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (30-300 microM) before LPS, the antiaggregatory activity was strongly reduced. The reduction of activity by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was reversed by L-arginine (100 microM) but not by D-arginine (100 microM). Under similar conditions, LPS also enhanced the antiaggregatory activity of ECs grown on beads. The immediate enhancement by LPS of the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelial cells may contribute to the rapid fall in blood pressure associated with endotoxin shock in vivo.\r"

Induction at 42 degrees C led to 50 to 100-fold overproduction of EIImtl (5-10 mg/g of cell wet weight) relative to mannitol-induced levels in a wild-type (Mtl+) strain. Most of the overproduced protein was sequestered as an inactive form in inclusion bodies and cytoplasmic membranous structures. The protein could be extracted in an active form by rupturing the cells with lysozyme and sonication or with a passage through a French pressure cell and incubating the inclusion bodies and membranous structures with detergent (Lubrol PX or deoxycholate) in the presence of Q or S Sepharose ion-exchange resin for several hours.

The DNA sequence of sodA shows the presence of a potential binding site for a regulatory protein(s) at the -35 region. To explore the possible role of this region in the regulation of sodA, we used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to change the sequence of nucleotides -48 through -44 from 5'-GGCAT-3' to 5'-TTACG-3'. We studied the effect of this altered sequence on the expression of sodA. The data showed that the altered sequence resulted in the constitutive expression of the gene. Thus, E. coli harboring a plasmid containing the mutated sodA gene (pSNM6) were uninducible by paraquat in aerobiosis or by 2,2'-dipyridyl in aerobiosis or anaerobiosis. Furthermore, a multicopy plasmid containing the mutated sodA failed to titrate the repressor molecules present in an E. coli strain carrying the sodA-lacZ fusion. In contrast, multicopy plasmids containing the wild-type sodA gene were able to titrate the repressor protein and to cause the anaerobic induction of beta-galactosidase in this sodA-lacZ fusion strain. These results indicate that the region within and around the mutated sequence probably plays an important role in sodA regulation and that the mutation disrupts a sequence that interacts with the repressor.\r"

Fetal septal-diagonal band tissue was implanted into rats with a complete transection of the fimbria-fornix cholinergic pathway either as a cell suspension injected into the hippocampus or as a solid graft implanted in the lesion cavity. The grafts restored baseline acetylcholine release in the graft-reinnervated hippocampus to normal or supranormal levels. The graft-derived acetylcholine release was dependent on intact axonal impulse flow, and it was markedly increased during behavioral activation by sensory stimulation or by electrical stimulation of the lateral habenula. The results demonstrate that the septal grafts, despite their ectopic location, can become functionally integrated with the host brain and that the activity of the transplanted cholinergic neurons can be modulated from the host brain during ongoing behavior. Anatomical observations, using immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing, indicate that direct or indirect brainstem afferents to the graft could mediate this functional integration. Host afferent control of the graft may thus play a role in the recovery of lesion-induced functional deficits seen with these types of transplants.\r"

Upon photolysis the 32P-labeled probe was shown to link covalently to a 35-kDa protein present in microsomal membranes prepared from several wild-type yeast strains. Binding was either reduced or absent in the microsomal membranes from two yeast mutants (alg5 and dpg1) that are known to be defective in the synthesis of glucosylphosphodolichol. The microsomes isolated from a heterozygous diploid strain alg5::dpg1 generated from these two mutants exhibited partial restoration of both the ability to photolabel the 35-kDa protein and the ability to catalyze the synthesis of glucosylphosphodolichol. Microsomal membranes from a mutant strain that synthesized glucosylphosphodolichol but lacked the ability to transfer the glucosyl residue to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide (alg6) exhibited labeling with 5-azido[beta-32P]UDPGlc comparable to that found in microsomes from the wild-type strain. In all cases photoinsertion of the probe into the 35-kDa protein correlated with the level of synthase assayed in the microsomal membranes. These results strongly support the conclusion that the 35-kDa protein labeled in these experiments is a component of glucosylphosphodolichol synthase.\r"

We have now used an in vitro transcription system to study the effect of purified L4 on expression of the S10 operon. We find that the cell-free system reproduces the in vivo observations. Namely, in the absence of L4, most of the RNA polymerases read through the termination site in the S10 attenuator; the addition of L4 results in increased termination at this site. However, RNA polymerase does not terminate at the S10 attenuator, with or without L4, unless an additional factor, protein NusA, is added to the transcription reaction. These results suggest that the attenuator in the S10 operon is a NusA-dependent terminator whose efficiency is regulated by ribosomal protein L4.\r"

I show here that three E. coli heat shock proteins, DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE, are directly involved in P1 plasmid replication. Purified DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE proteins were required to stimulate P1 plasmid ori DNA-dependent replication in in vitro complementation assays in which the host protein fractions were prepared from cells mutated in the corresponding gene. I have also found that the DnaJ and RepA proteins form a complex. This complex exists in crude cell extracts and can be isolated as a molecular species of about 160,000 Da containing one dimer of DnaJ protein and one dimer of RepA. The complex can also be reconstituted by mixing purified DnaJ and RepA proteins. These results imply that the DnaJ-RepA complex, DnaK, and GrpE are directly involved in P1 plasmid replication.\r"

  ".W": "The RAD6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for DNA repair, DNA damage-induced mutagenesis, and sporulation. RAD6 protein is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that has been shown to attach multiple molecules of ubiquitin to histones H2A and H2B. We have now examined whether the E2 activity of RAD6 is involved in its various biological functions. Since the formation of a thioester adduct between E2 and ubiquitin is necessary for E2 activity, the single cysteine residue (Cys-88) present in RAD6 was changed to alanine or valine. The mutant proteins were overproduced in yeast cells and purified to near homogeneity. We show that the rad6 Ala-88 and rad6 Val-88 mutant proteins lack the capacity for thioester formation with ubiquitin and, as a consequence, are totally devoid of any E2 activity. The rad6 Ala-88 and rad6 Val-88 mutations confer a defect in DNA repair, mutagenesis, and sporulation equivalent to that in the rad6 null allele. We suggest that the biological functions of RAD6 require its E2 activity.\r"

Transient expression assays using the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were used initially to localize regions directing primary promoter function. Stepwise deletion of 5' promoter sequences resulted in a gradual decrease in the ability to drive transcription of the reporter gene, suggesting that this promoter is composed of multiple cis-acting elements. Gel mobility-shift and DNase protection studies involving a 166-base-pair DNA fragment allowed the identification of protein-binding sites corresponding to these multiple regulatory elements. One element demonstrating particular transcriptional influence exists as a homopurine/homopyrimidine-rich region that in vitro exhibits S1 nuclease sensitivity and binds at least one nuclear protein. Data from competition binding experiments suggest that this nuclear factor may be influential in the regulation of other essential growth-control genes as well.\r"

Aliquots of the PCR mixture containing cDNA copies of the RNA to be assayed were added to serial dilutions of a competitor DNA fragment that differed from the cDNA of interest by having either a small intron or a mutated internal restriction enzyme site. Therefore, the same primers were used to coamplify the unknown and the competitor. The ratio of products remains constant through the amplification and can be readily quantitated. In unstimulated cells, no GM-CSF or IL-3 mRNA could be detected. However, with appropriate induction, mRNA for both cytokines was detected and quantitated in as few as 200 cells. Competitive PCR was also used to accurately quantitate the copy number of the human GM-CSF gene in normal human cells, in a clonal population of cells from a patient with 5q- syndrome, and in a human-hamster cell line known to have only one copy of the human GM-CSF gene.\r"

The coding sequence of human adenosine deaminase was recombined into a baculovirus immediately downstream from the strong polyhedrin gene promoter. Approximately 60 hr after infection of insect cells with the recombinant virus, maximal levels of intracellular adenosine deaminase mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity were detected. The recombinant human adenosine deaminase represented 10% of the total cellular protein and exhibited a specific activity of 70 units/mg of protein in crude homogenate. This specific activity is 70-350 times greater than that exhibited by the enzyme in homogenates of the two most abundant natural sources of human adenosine deaminase, thymus and leukemic cells. When the recombinant virus was injected into insect larvae, the maximum recombinant enzyme was produced 4 days postinfection and represented about 2% of the total insect protein with a specific activity of 10-25 units/mg of protein. The recombinant human adenosine deaminase was purified to homogeneity from both insect cells and larvae and demonstrated to be identical to native adenosine deaminase purified from human cells with respect to molecular weight, interaction with polyclonal anti-adenosine deaminase antibody, and enzymatic properties. A pilot purification yielded 8-9 mg of homogeneous enzyme from 22 larvae. The production of large quantities of recombinant human adenosine deaminase in insect larvae is inexpensive and rapid and eliminates the need for specialized facilities for tissue culture. This method should be applicable to large-scale production of many recombinant proteins.\r"

In addition, our analysis has shown that inactivations of the RB gene are nearly as frequent in a more common human tumor, small cell lung carcinoma. One-third of bladder carcinomas surveyed also carry altered or absent p105-Rb. Other human tumors by contrast demonstrate only infrequent inactivation of the RB gene. These results suggest that inactivation of the RB gene is a critical step in the pathogenesis of a subset of human tumors.\r"

To understand the RNA structural features that dictate mRNA decay rates in yeast, we have constructed PGK1/MAT alpha 1 and ACT1/MAT alpha 1 gene fusions and analyzed the decay rates of the resultant chimeric transcripts. Fusion of a MAT alpha 1 segment containing 73% of the coding region and the 3' untranslated region to either of the stable genes is sufficient to cause rapid decay of the chimeric mRNAs (t1/2 = 6-7.5 min). Sequences required for this rapid decay are not found in the MAT alpha 1 3' untranslated region but are located within a 42-nucleotide segment of the coding region that has a high content (8 out of 14) of rare codons. Introduction of a translational stop codon upstream of this region stabilizes the hybrid mRNAs, indicating that the rapid decay promoted by these sequences is dependent on ribosomal translocation.\r"

  ".U": "90207289\r", 
  ".W": "The D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidases/transpeptidases (penicillin-binding proteins, PBPs) share considerable structural homology with class A beta-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6), although these beta-lactamases have no observable D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase activity. With the objective of recruiting such activity into a beta-lactamase background, we have prepared a chimeric protein by inserting a 28-amino acid segment of PBP-5 of Escherichia coli in place of the corresponding region of the RTEM-1 beta-lactamase. The segment thus inserted encompasses two residues conserved in both families: Ser-70, which forms the acyl-enzyme intermediate during beta-lactam hydrolysis, and Lys-73, whose presence has been shown to be necessary for catalysis. This chimera involves changes of 18 residues and gives a protein that differs at 7% of the residues from the parent. Whereas RTEM beta-lactamase has no D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase activity, that of the chimera is significant and is, in fact, about 1% the activity of PBP-5 on diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala; in terms of free energy of activation, the chimera stabilizes the transition state for the reaction to within about 2.7 kcal/mol of the stabilization achieved by PBP-5. Furthermore, the chimera catalyzes hydrolysis exclusively at the carboxyl-terminal amide bond which is the site of cleavage by D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase. Though containing all those residues that are conserved throughout class A beta-lactamases and are thought to be essential for beta-lactamase activity, the chimera has considerably reduced activity (approximately 10(-5) on penams such as penicillins and ampicillins as substrates. As a catalyst, the chimera shows an induction period of approximately 30 min, reflecting a slow conformational rearrangement from an inactive precursor to the active enzyme.\r"

Using this system and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, we have identified intermediates with stalled replication forks. The replication bubbles contain both arrested leading strands and lagging strands that were initiated at the ColE1 origin of replication and that had progressed unidirectionally until arrested at tau. To dissect the system further, we have analyzed the kinetics of the formation of the termination intermediates and have discovered that the earliest termination intermediate had properties consistent with an arrested D loop. The D loop contained an arrested leading strand. Thus, in this test system, there appears to be a transient uncoupling of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis during termination of replication at tau sites.\r"

The increased sensitivity of these spermidine-deficient mutants to paraquat is eliminated by growth in medium containing spermidine or by endogenous supplementation of spermidine by the use of a speE+D+ plasmid. No paraquat toxicity is seen in the absence of oxygen, even in amine-deficient strains, indicating that superoxide is the agent responsible for the increased toxicity. However, the specific mechanisms responsible for the increased paraquat toxicity in the spermidine-deficient mutants remain to be determined. The marked sensitivity to paraquat of E. coli deficient in spermidine is of particular interest, since such mutants have no other phenotypic properties that can be easily assayed. This increased sensitivity has been used as the basis of a convenient method for scoring for mutants in polyamine biosynthesis and for the detection of plasmids containing the biosynthetic genes.\r"

Patients and their sexual partners should be monitored for cervical carcinoma and other epithelial malignancies associated with HPV infection.

Today, nearly 70 years later and more than 40 years after the widespread availability of penicillin, virtually every one of the more than 30 recognized sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) still defies control in the United States. Cases of STDs are increasing at dramatic rates, at enormous societal and personal cost. The epidemic of AIDS has diverted needed funds, personnel, and other resources from the nation's programs of research, training, prevention, and control of STDs. Ironically, the epidemics of STDs, the diseases themselves and the sexual and drug-using behaviors surrounding them, are now fueling the HIV epidemic. Although it is often said that education is the only prevention for AIDS, in fact there is another important and cost-effective component of HIV prevention: the control of other STDs. STDs are not only public health concerns, but issues of biomedical research, economics, access to care, public and professional education, drug use, poverty, and last but not least politics. Their prevention and control demands new research approaches, the development of necessary expertise, and a major and sustained investment of resources.\r"

This reflects a younger patient group, often otherwise healthy patients who consult for contraception, as well as recognizing the trust and respect that comes from long-term patient relationships. Both provide primary care physicians with the opportunity for effectively conveying prevention messages. From the perspective of the primary care provider, this article reviews the importance of awareness of STD, timely information, and steps for effectively dealing with a common and growing medical challenge.\r"

  ".W": "All sexually transmitted diseases are behaviorally correlated. A thorough understanding of the behaviors involved in the spread of sexually transmitted disease will increase the physician's ability to suspect, properly identify, and treat the disease. An appreciation of the common sexual behavior in contemporary American society will allow the physician to more effectively address patients' concerns about their sexuality and sexual behavior and identify areas for which further professional counseling is appropriate. Physicians are the most trusted source of health information, often counsel their patients on intimate subjects, and therefore are in a unique position to promote individual behavioral and perceptual changes for limiting the spread of sexually transmitted disease. Physicians must, therefore, be aggressive in taking sexual histories, especially for young, sexually active patients, whether heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. Clinicians must deliberately cultivate a comfortable, sympathetic attitude and provide an environment in which a complete and honest sexual practices history will freely flow. Once the patients at risk for STDs are identified, the physician should attempt to counsel them to reduce their risk through safer sexual practices. If little office time is available for these sensitive educational issues, then the physician should identify individuals within the office or appropriate programs in the community for referral. Representative data on the sexual behavior of all Americans will be relevant not only to the AIDS crisis but also to other national sex-related problems such as the growing incidence of chlamydia, other sexually transmitted diseases, and the costly multigenerational impact of epidemic teenage pregnancy. Comprehensive, well-designed studies of contemporary sexual behavior are needed now.\r"

The patient who presents to the primary care office with gonococcal disease, or one who is found to be infected after screening, still faces significant emotional and economic barriers to effective treatment and control of the spread of the disease. Along with the emergence of resistant strains and the previously existing problems of asymptomatic carriers and reluctance to seek treatment, physicians are charged with the problems of identifying patients at risk for the disease, providing effective treatment for those infected, and preventing further spread of infection. Simple, effective, and inexpensive therapies that also treat the frequently present coinfections with other sexually transmitted diseases are not yet available. Antibiotic therapy must still be chosen with regard to the patient's history and circumstances. The approach to counseling the patient about avoidance of complications, prevention of reinfection, and prevention of transmission of infection must be mastered by the primary care physician if progress is to be made toward the eradication of gonococcal disease.\r"

Of these, 75,000 will get conjunctivitis, and 30,000 will get pneumonia.

Symptomatic primary infections tend to be severe and prolonged, whereas recurrences are milder and shorter in duration. The most sensitive and specific laboratory test currently available for detecting and typing HSV is tissue culture. The most appropriate management strategy for pregnant women at risk for transmitting the virus at delivery is currently being studied and debated, but evidence indicates that routine surveillance cultures in pregnant women with a history of HSV infection are of no clinical usefulness and that, if there are no visible lesions, culture is not necessary and vaginal delivery is acceptable. Although acyclovir can effectively control symptomatology and speed the healing of lesions, it does not, with current dosage regimens, decrease the frequency of subsequent recurrences. Asymptomatic viral shedding is now considered to cause a large proportion of HSV transmissions; the role of acyclovir in suppression of viral shedding is an area requiring further study.\r"

The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine was used to test whether this slow neurotoxicity is mediated by a calcium influx through voltage-gated channels. Nifedipine had little effect on the widespread neuronal degeneration induced by brief exposure to high concentrations of NMDA but substantially attenuated the neurotoxicity produced by 24-hour exposure to submaximal concentrations of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate, kainate, or quinolinate. Calcium ion influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channels may be an important step in the neuronal injury induced by the prolonged activation of NMDA or non-NMDA glutamate receptors.\r"

However, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms that mediate the effects of these hormones or their interactions. The most prominent protein induced by estrogen in the ventromedial hypothalamus has the same amino-terminal sequence as the most prominent protein induced by LH-RH in the pituitary in vitro and in vivo; these proteins comigrate on two-dimensional gels. Furthermore, the hormonal induction may be caused by modification of a constitutive protein with the same molecular weight (70,000) but a slightly more acidic isoelectric point, whose level is inversely related to the level of the induced form after estrogen treatment. Thus estrogen and LH-RH may interact by additively or synergistically inducing this protein, which is called HIP-70.\r"

It seemed likely, therefore that a factor might exist to accelerate the release of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and hence the exchange of GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Such a factor has now been discovered in rat brain cytosol. Brain cytosol was found to catalyze, by orders of magnitude, the release of guanine nucleotides from recombinant v-H-Ras protein bound with [alpha-32P]GDP. This effect occurred even in the presence of a large excess of Mg2+, but was destroyed by heat or by incubation of the cytosol for an hour at 37 degrees C in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The effect was observed with either v-H-Ras or c-H-Ras, but not with p25rab3A, a small G protein with about 30% similarity to Ras. The effect could not be mimicked by addition of recombinant Ras-GAP or purified GEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. By gel filtration chromatography, the factor appears to possess a molecular size between 100,000 and 160,000 daltons. This protein (Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, or Ras-GRF) may be involved in the activation of p21ras.\r"

The ability of the E6 proteins from different human papillomaviruses to form complexes with p53 was assayed and found to correlate with the in vivo clinical behavior and the in vitro transforming activity of these different papillomaviruses. The wild-type p53 protein has tumor suppressor properties and has also been found in association with large T antigen and the E1B 55-kilodalton protein in cells transformed by SV40 and by adenovirus type 5, respectively, providing further evidence that the human papillomaviruses, the adenoviruses, and SV40 may effect similar cellular pathways in transformation.\r"

When expression vectors for erbB-2, which is structurally related to EGFR, or its truncated counterpart, delta NerbB-2, were introduced into 32D cells, neither was capable of inducing proliferation. This was despite overexpression and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of their products at levels associated with potent transformation of fibroblast target cells. Thus, EGFR and erbB-2 couple with distinct mitogenic signaling pathways. The region responsible for the specificity of intracellular signal transduction was localized to a 270-amino acid stretch encompassing their respective tyrosine kinase domains. Thus, tissue- or cell-specific regulation of growth factor receptor signaling can occur at a point after the initial interaction of growth factor with receptor. Such specificity in signal transduction may account for the selection of certain oncogenes in some malignancies.\r"

Bacteremia was present in 15 of 68 (22%), the most frequent isolates being Mycoplasma (four cases) and B bivius (three cases). Clindamycin-resistant species were S faecalis, E coli, and Proteus mirabilis. There were seven treatment failures in the ampicillin/sulbactam group; only one isolate (an E coli) was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam. In a significant number of these failures, Mycoplasma was isolated. Ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin were found to be equally efficacious in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.\r"

However, corticosteroids have devastating side effects when given frequently or for prolonged periods. High doses of systemic corticosteroid preparations should be used only during bouts of acute bronchospasm, whereas the lowest possible dose needed to control symptoms is recommended for the treatment of chronic asthma. Aerosolized steroids offer an alternative to systemic preparations and have less associated morbidity. Various corticosteroid preparations have various potencies and durations of action that need to be considered. Patients with coexisting liver disease require preparations that do not need hepatic hydroxylation, whereas patients with congestive heart failure require preparations that minimize salt retention. When asthma and pregnancy coexist, it is vital that symptoms of bronchospasm are controlled to protect the fetus. During stressful situations, such as surgery, it is important to consider the possibility of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression if the asthmatic patient has been previously treated with corticosteroids.\r"

  ".U": "90208591\r", 
  ".W": "Portal hypertension results from an interaction of abnormal intrahepatic resistance and increases in portal blood flow. Intrahepatic resistance is probably multifactorial in nature and may include compression of hepatic veins by regenerating nodules, collagen deposition in sinusoids and venules, hepatocyte enlargement, and constriction of sinusoids by contractile myofibroblasts. The increase in splanchnic blood flow observed is incompletely understood, but it may involve circulating vasodilators and alteration in volume and sodium balance. The end result of these interactions is the development of increased portal pressure and portosystemic collaterals, the most important of which are esophageal varices. The rupture of esophageal varices is a devastating complication of portal hypertension. Increased portal pressure is necessary for the development and rupture of varices but apparently not sufficient, because many patients with elevated portal pressures never bleed. Presumably, local factors must be involved. Variceal wall tension is probably the best single descriptor of risk from variceal hemorrhage. The wall-tension formula unites the contributions of portal pressure, varix size, and wall thickness to variceal rupture. Lowering portal pressure, reducing varix size, and supporting varices in scar tissue may all lower the risk of hemorrhage.\r"

In the United States, chronic liver disease, usually due to alcohol, is the most common underlying cause. The history, physical examination, and laboratory analysis are usually sufficient to confirm the presence of underlying liver disease. If there is any question as to the etiology of portal hypertension, however, a more complete evaluation is required, whether the presenting complication is ascites, variceal bleeding, or hypersplenism. Usually, such an evaluation will require a liver biopsy, portal pressure measurement, and angiography. Occasionally, a noninvasive evaluation will be sufficient, but the value of these noninvasive parameters is still under investigation. Surgical mortality generally depends on the severity of the liver disease. Therefore, surgical intervention must be carefully considered in comparison to other therapeutic modalities depending on the patient's hepatic functional reserve. Secondary bacterial peritonitis due to perforation requires surgery regardless of the severity of the underlying liver disease.\r"

Devascularization procedures have a limited role in the emergency situation, but they may be useful in patients who are nonshuntable because of splanchnic venous thrombosis. The Sugiura type of operation is appropriate for the nonalcoholic patient, and esophageal transection is appropriate for the alcoholic patient with cirrhosis.

Azygos blood flow, as a measure of collateral circulation, including that through varices, is always reduced, but the effects on portal pressure, whether measured directly or by the wedged hepatic venous pressure, are variable. The initial reported correlation between a 25% reduction of resting pulse rate and similar percentage reduction in the wedged free hepatic venous gradient has not been reproduced in subsequent studies. Therefore, to study the effect of changes in hemodynamic indices and the likelihood of variceal bleeding, direct measurements of such indices need to be made in clinical trials. At present, only one primary-prevention trial of propranolol suggests that a hemodynamic index can be used to identify patients given propranolol who will not bleed. Some clinical factors may be important in identifying nonresponders in trials of secondary prevention, but these are not universally recognized. The results of secondary-prevention studies are very heterogeneous, and it is difficult to understand why this is so. However, comparative studies versus sclerotherapy suggest that reductions in rebleeding and mortality are similar. Pharmacologic treatment, including beta-blockade, is ideal for primary prevention of variceal bleeding. The initial results from randomized studies are more homogeneous regarding the benefit of beta-blockers than in the secondary-prevention studies, although there is still doubt about the response in cirrhotics with ascites. No fatal complications due to propranolol administration have been reported in cirrhotic patients, and the complications are reversible. The future of pharmacologic therapy for portal hypertension lies in combination therapy. The addition of vasodilators to beta-blockers appears to potentiate their effect on portal pressure reduction. The results of clinical trials are awaited with great interest.\r"

We prefer either an intravariceal or a combined intravariceal and paravariceal technique using ethanolamine oleate, but we advocate that individual units utilize the technique with which they have the most experience. The use of an unmodified flexible endoscope has been almost universally accepted. Once active variceal bleeding is diagnosed on emergency endoscopy, immediate emergency sclerotherapy should be performed. When this is not possible, bleeding should be controlled by balloon-tube tamponade with subsequent delayed emergency sclerotherapy after resuscitation. Patients with variceal bleeding that has stopped at the time of the diagnostic endoscopy can either be treated by immediate sclerotherapy or be observed initially and subsequently treated using the long-term management policy of the unit concerned. Over 90% of actively bleeding patients should be controlled using emergency sclerotherapy. Failures are defined as patients who have more than two acute variceal bleeds during a single hospital admission. Such patients should be identified early and treated either by simple staple-gun transection or by an emergency portosystemic shunt. Repeated injection sclerotherapy using a flexible endoscope and the technique with which the group concerned has the most experience is recommended as the primary form of treatment for the majority of patients after a proven esophageal variceal bleed. Repeat injection treatments should probably be performed at weekly intervals until the esophageal varices are eradicated, with follow-up at 6-month or yearly intervals thereafter. Recurrent varices should be treated similarly. Failures of sclerotherapy are defined as patients who have either recurrent bleeds or in whom varices are difficult to eradicate. They require either a portosystemic shunt or a devascularization and transection operation. All patients presenting with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding should be evaluated for liver transplantation; unfortunately, however, few variceal bleeders are candidates for transplantation. Prophylactic sclerotherapy in patients with esophageal varices that have not bled remains unjustified outside of controlled trials. Available trials have produced conflicting data.\r"

Additionally, a large, one-institution series of side-to-side portacaval shunts has been presented that yielded good results. It is hoped that this presentation has succeeded, at a minimum, in causing the reader to question the basis of treatment for variceal hemorrhage and, at a maximum, in convincing him or her to retain the portacaval shunt as a mainstay in treating the hemorrhagic complications of portal hypertension.\r"

Maintenance of prograde portal flow is greater than 90% in nonalcoholic disease, but only 50% in alcoholic cirrhosis; the latter is improved by total splenopancreatic disconnection. Hepatic function is better maintained when portal flow is maintained. Encephalopathy is lower after DSRS than after total shunts.

  ".W": "To evaluate the various nonshunting treatment modalities currently being used, it is difficult to make comparative assessments by reviewing the literature. There is varied composition in the groups studied; numerous major modifications, but more often subtle but poorly described differences in surgical techniques; and lack of uniform definitions and methods of reporting even the most basic of results, be it recurrent hemorrhage, encephalopathy, or survival. Series often lump together patients with cirrhosis, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic, noncirrhotic intrahepatic block, and extrahepatic block, each of which has a different natural history, prognosis, and physiologic and hemodynamic response to interventions. Classification of severity of cirrhosis, although commonly referred to as Child's class A, B, or C, may be based on time of assessment, worst criteria present, or a point scoring system. The operations are described as \"emergency,\" \"urgent,\" \"emergent,\" or \"elective,\" and the definition of each varies with investigator. Clearly, the ability of the patient to stop bleeding and survive the hazards and high mortality of the early hours of the acute event places him in a better risk group irrespective of whether the surgical intervention is performed \"urgently\" within 24 hours or electively in 24 days. Expressions of long-term survival frequently do not always take into account the operative deaths or the mean follow-up time. However, some general remarks can be made. The Sugiura procedure can be performed with an extremely low mortality in selected elective patients, particularly the nonalcoholic, with virtually no postoperative encephalopathy and negligible variceal rebleeding. Postoperative major hepatic decompensation does not appear to occur with time, and long-term survival would appear superior to DSR shunt. In the class A or B alcoholic cirrhotic, results are certainly as good as and perhaps better than DSR shunt, and it is a reasonable alternative, particularly when technical and other considerations make the performance of such a shunt difficult. Surgeons who routinely perform the Warren shunt should have this operation available in their repertoire as an alternative. Attempts to compromise and reduce the extent of devascularization utilizing only a thoracic or abdominal venue or to violate Sugiura's principle of leaving intact the coronary-periesophageal-azygos venous pathway generally result in a progressively higher incidence of recurrent hemorrhage with time. The early success reported by Perecchia, Abouna, and Franco, with a transabdominal approach and lesser thoracic devascularization, which avoids \"entry\" into the chest, is noted with interest for the future and suggests such an approach for the more critically bleeding patients rather than the initial thoracic approach of others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90208602\r", 
  ".W": "At the present time, liver transplantation must be considered among the treatment options for patients with variceal hemorrhage. For a significant percentage of variceal bleeders throughout the world, however, transplantation is not a viable option either because the patient is not an appropriate transplant candidate or because of the etiology of the patient's portal hypertension. Sclerotherapy and portosystemic shunts remain the mainstay of therapy for these patients. The survival rates with liver transplantation are superior to those reported for other therapies for variceal hemorrhage in patients who have moderate or severe liver disease in addition to variceal hemorrhage. Child's C patients whose variceal hemorrhage is controlled medically should be evaluated for transplantation and receive chronic sclerotherapy while they wait on the transplant list. If the variceal hemorrhage cannot be controlled medically in a transplant candidate, then the patient should undergo an emergency shunt procedure. The shunt of choice is a large-bore H-graft mesocaval or mesorenal shunt. This shunt effectively controls the acute hemorrhage, is relatively simple to perform, does not adversely impact on the subsequent liver transplant, and can simply be ligated after the transplant is completed. Patients who experience variceal hemorrhage as the only manifestation of their liver disease should be treated initially with endoscopic sclerotherapy. For that small group of patients who are either not candidates for sclerotherapy or who rebleed despite sclerotherapy, the choice of shunt or transplantation is presently a difficult one, because both therapies provide excellent results in this group of patients. The choice of therapy should be made on an individual basis and only after consultation with both transplant and shunt surgeons. If a shunt is chosen, we prefer the DSRS because it maintains hepatic portal perfusion in many patients and does not require dissection of the porta hepatis. The management of patients with a prior portosystemic shunt at the time of transplantation depends on the type of shunt and the duration of time between the shunt and the transplant. Shunts not involving the hepatic hilum have little adverse impact on the performance of the transplant. There are insufficient data to assess accurately the effect of a prior portacaval shunt on the transplant. However, our clinical experience and that of other transplant groups indicate that the transplantation of these patients is technically more difficult than that of patients with shunts not involving the hilum. With the availability of other shunting procedures that do not involve extensive dissection of the hepatic hilum, there is little role for either end-to-side or side-to-side portacaval shunts in patients who are potential liver transplant candidates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The high mortality of a first variceal bleed in cirrhotic patients even in very recent studies makes some effective form of primary prophylaxis desirable. Controlled studies of shunt and nonshunting surgery have shown that these operations can prevent variceal hemorrhage only at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this type of surgery has no place in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Liver transplantation, however, is becoming a real therapeutic alternative for many patients with chronic liver disease. Obviously, it will prevent bleeding in many patients, but primary prophylaxis of bleeding itself is not an indication for a transplant. The radically different results of randomized controlled trials of prophylactic sclerotherapy indicate that it is either very helpful and will save many lives or very harmful and will lead to death in patients who would otherwise survive. The cumulative evidence from the trials that took appropriate care of effective treatment for the acute bleed and that had no major problems with complications of the procedure itself suggests that prophylactic sclerotherapy is neither helpful nor very harmful. Thus, there is also no indication for prophylactic sclerotherapy in clinical routine. Personally, I even doubt that it should be used in future controlled trials in the light of the positive results of the prophylactic trials of beta-blockers. If there is an indication for prophylactic treatment, it should be the last invasive treatment available. In the near future, work should focus on the confirmation and further development of endoscopic or other simple and safe means to predict the risk of first bleeding; on the development and characterization of effective drugs; and on development of methods to identify at an early stage responders and nonresponders. If I presently had large varices that had not yet bled, I would like to join one of my senior colleagues and look for admission to the Control group of an ongoing randomized beta-blocker trial.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective follow-up study of 5,571 general surgical patients at 11 hospitals (23 departments) in Israel, 1,487 patients underwent operations for hernia (all types) and were screened daily for the development of postsurgical wound infection. Infection developed in 68 (4.6 per cent) at the site of the incision. Fourteen factors were analyzed for the presumed effect on the risk of infection; only four were significant in a multivariate model. Of these factors (old age, incarcerated or recurrent hernia, coexistent infection and drains), the introduction of drains had the strongest effect (relative risk equaled 4.1; p less than 0.001). Drains increased the risk in all the participating hospitals and in any category of patient. They prolonged the period a wound was susceptible to bacterial infection from nine to 16 days. The risk increased linearly with the duration of the drainage. The over-all proportion of patients who had a drain inserted was 19 per cent, with hospitals varying from 9 to 40 per cent of patients operated upon (p less than 0.001). Our findings suggest that the risk of an infection associated with drains may outweight their worth. Furthermore, there is no concensus among surgeons on the need for drains. Some surgeons use drains indiscriminately and others, rarely.\r"

EUS was performed before surgery in 33 patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy with lymph node dissection in our department of surgery between January 1987 and February 1989. The findings of EUS prospectively correlated with intraoperative macroscopic findings and histopathologic findings of the resected specimens. An accurate diagnosis of the depth of invasion into the esophageal wall was made in 30 of the 33 patients (90.1%). Visualization rates of mediastinal lymph nodes were 92.9%, 53.1%, and 1.0% when the nodes were greater than 10 mm in maximum diameter, 5 to 9 mm, and less than 5 mm, respectively. Although EUS had no diagnostic value for patients in whom the ultrasonic probe could not be inserted beyond the tumor, it is an excellent method for evaluating the depth of invasion and detecting lymph nodes greater than 10 mm in diameter. Detection is not feasible when the lymph node is less than 5 mm in diameter. EUS provides the surgeon with one more tool for the preoperative determination of curability.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic artery thrombosis and early acute rejection are severe complications of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Their rapid detection is most desirable. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of monitoring hepatic artery (HABF) and portal vein (PVBF) blood flows during the first week after OLT. At the end of operation, microprobes were sutured to the vessels, and their connecting tubes were externalized and connected to a pulsed Doppler flowmeter operating at 8 MHz. In 10 patients (ages ranged from 2 to 54 years) of 106, measurements of HABF and PVBF were done during alternative clamping of both vessels and before and after abdominal closure, every 12 hours during 7 days, and at day 7, before and after a 150 gm carbohydrate meal. At day 7 the probes were pulled out by gentle traction without complication, and all patients were allowed to go home. Reciprocal increase of flow during selective clamping was only observed for HABF (+45.8% +/- 47.6%; p less than 0.01). Abdominal closure decreased both HABF and PVBF by 13.8%, p less than 0.01, and 26%, p less than 0.05, respectively. In seven cases no significant variation of HABF and PVBF was observed during 7 days. In two patients with histologically confirmed early acute rejection, a marked decrease of diastolic HABF, without modification in PVBF, was the first manifestation and was rapidly corrected by boluses of steroids. In one patient disappearance of systolic and diastolic HABF led us to diagnose an arterial obliteration caused by a plicature, which was successfully surgically treated in the emergency department. In all patients, after oral ingestion of the carbohydrate meal, and only after this type of diet, a significant and deep decrease (-87%, p less than 0.001) of HABF was observed between 7 and 120 minutes without any change in PVBF. Such an effect was not observed in control patients. We conclude that this Doppler flowmetric technique with implantable microprobes is useful for rapid diagnosis of and strategy in treating early complications and is a new tool for pathophysiologic study of OLT consequences.\r"

Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats underwent proximal jejunal bypass, 11 rats underwent Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomies, and 12 rats underwent sham operations. After 3 months, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in unanesthetized animals and venous blood was collected for plasma glucose and insulin measurements. The surgical procedures did not significantly affect the basal glucose and insulin levels compared with sham-operated animals. The insulin response in rats with excluded proximal jejunal segments was inhibited. The decreased insulinogenic index seen in these animals indicates a possible diabetogenic effect of this procedure. An oral glucose challenge resulted in significant hyperinsulinemia, with an increased insulinogenic index in animals that had undergone Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomies. These findings suggest that bile is a potential mediator in the proximal jejunal involvement in the enteroinsular axis.\r"

Seven patients treated with furosemide on completion of TURP had a statistically significant delayed drop in serum sodium values after normal initial values (139 mEq/L to 134 mEq/L). Seven untreated control patients did not have a similar drop in sodium values, and the difference between groups was significant. We suggest that furosemide be used with caution in patients undergoing routine TURP, and when given it should be accompanied by the infusion of an isotonic balanced salt solution.\r"

During the Valsalva maneuver, despite marked reduction in the mean arterial pressure during phase III (96 +/- 12 to 68 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), the reduction of coronary blood flow velocity did not achieve statistical significance. These data demonstrate that neither type of abrupt physiologic increase in intrathoracic pressure enhances coronary blood flow. Coughing does not improve coronary perfusion pressures or flow velocity, despite marked increases in arterial diastolic pressure. The Valsalva maneuver, for the most part, does not significantly alter coronary blood flow velocity.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic therapy for prevention of sustained ventricular tachycardia is commonly guided by programmed electrical stimulation, and the persistent ability to initiate ventricular tachycardia during drug therapy often leads to the use of nonpharmacologic therapies such as surgery. Prior studies suggest that programmed stimulation has a high sensitivity but a lower specificity for predicting recurrences of ventricular tachycardia during drug therapy. We constructed a model to evaluate the impact of various programmed stimulation specificities and sensitivities on total mortality when patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia during drug therapy proceed to arrhythmia surgery. Assumptions for this model included an 11.5% surgical mortality, a 13% risk of arrhythmia recurrence for surgery survivors, and that 33% of ventricular tachycardia recurrences are fatal. In this model the relative impact of test sensitivity and specificity on total population mortality depended on the pretest probability that drug therapy would be effective. When this probability was high, variations in test sensitivity had relatively little impact on mortality, but a low specificity increased mortality by increasing the number of false positive patients treated surgically who then suffered the surgical mortality. When the probability of effective drug therapy was low, varying test specificity had relatively little impact on mortality, but a low sensitivity increased mortality by increasing the number of patients with a false negative test who suffered fatal arrhythmia recurrences. If the specificity of programmed stimulation is low and the probability that drug therapy will be effective is high, the total population mortality can exceed the mortality expected from drug therapy alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were performed before treatment, after 8 weeks of placebo, and after 8 weeks of labetalol therapy in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. The mean (+/- SEM) dose of labetalol for the group was 275 +/- 29 mg. Compared to treatment with placebo, the maximum duration of symptom-limited exercise was significantly prolonged with labetalol (580 +/- 72 seconds to 683 +/- 71 seconds; p less than 0.005). Both the resting and peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced. Ascending aortic blood flow velocity was also measured by continuous-wave Doppler technique during exercise. Compared to placebo, treatment with labetalol conferred no significant change in cardiac output at rest but significantly improved cardiac output at maximum exercise (14 +/- 3%; p less than 0.001). Doppler-derived peak aortic flow velocity, acceleration, and flow velocity integral were also significantly improved at maximum exercise. Systemic vascular resistance, as derived from mean blood pressure/cardiac output, was reduced by 12 +/- 3% and 16 +/- 3% at rest and at maximum exercise, respectively. New York Heart Association functional class was improved (3.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.005). No major side effects from labetalol were encountered. Thus labetalol improves symptomatology, exercise capacity, and exercise hemodynamics and reduces systemic vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

After the mode is determined, pacemaker parameters are estimated: LRLI for all pacemakers, as well as AV interval, LRLI, and post-ventricular atrial refractory period for dual-chambered pacemakers. Finally, pacemaker function is analyzed to determine if an emergency exists, such as ventricular noncapture or ventricular nonsensing. This method should benefit practitioners who are faced with unknown patients, unknown pacemakers, or both, and may serve as a tool for teaching how to analyze the pacemaker ECG.\r"

  ".W": "In selected patients with systemic hypertension it may be difficult to ascertain whether left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a secondary end-organ consequence of long-term elevations in blood pressure or, alternatively, a manifestation of a coexistent primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To address this issue and better characterize LV hypertrophy in systemic hypertension, 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to define the patterns of LV hypertrophy in 102 patients with sustained systemic hypertension and marked degrees of wall thickening. Patients ranged in age from 31 to 88 years (mean 61) and were predominantly female (58%); all were black. By selection, each patient had a maximal LV wall thickness of greater than 15 mm (range 16 to 29). Distribution of hypertrophy was judged to be symmetric (i.e., concentric) in most patients (67 of 102, 66%). However, a substantial proportion (35 patients, 34%) demonstrated nonuniform, asymmetric patterns of hypertrophy in which at least 1 segment of the LV wall was at least 1.5 times the thickness of any other. In these 35 patients, the distribution of hypertrophy was similar to that characteristic of the morphologic spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with thickening of portions of both the ventricular septum and free wall in 16 patients, anterior and posterior ventricular septum alone in 11 patients and segmental involvement of only the anterior ventricular septum in 8. Patients with asymmetric patterns of wall thickening did not differ from the patients with symmetric hypertrophy with regard to age, sex or clinical findings. Asymmetric LV hypertrophy appears to represent an important feature of the morphologic spectrum of severe hypertensive heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An abnormal elevation in collagen concentration or myocardial fibrosis occurs in the hypertrophied left ventricle of the rat with renovascular hypertension (RHT). The structural nature and functional consequences of this fibrosis and the mechanisms involved in its appearance were reviewed for various phases of hypertrophy. Within days after the onset of renal ischemia, type I collagen messenger ribonucleic acid is expressed. An interstitial fibrosis follows, characterized by an increased dimension of existing perimysial fibers and the appearance of fibrillar collagen in spaces previously devoid of collagen, together with a perivascular fibrosis of intramyocardial coronary arteries. These expressions of myocardial fibrosis are associated with an increase in diastolic and systolic myocardial stiffness. Endomyocardial fibrosis serves to further increase diastolic stiffness while myocytes encircled by fibrillar collagen become atrophic. Each of these consequences of myocardial fibrosis reduce myocyte length-dependent force generation. At 32 weeks of RHT there is an obvious diastolic and systolic dysfunction of the ventricle together with heart failure that includes ventricular dilatation, wall thinning and reduced ejection fraction. The mechanisms involved in mediating fibrosis in RHT appear to be multiple. Myocyte necrosis and fibroblast proliferation have been associated with elevated circulating angiotensin II. Necrosis in RHT was not seen with captopril pretreatment or in the hypertension and hypertrophy that accompanied infrarenal aorta banding. An alteration in coronary artery permeability may be responsible for the perivascular fibrosis that is not seen with captopril pretreatment. Thus in RHT, the hemodynamic status of the ventricle determines myocyte hypertrophy while the elevation in circulating angiotensin II is responsible for the remodeling of nonmyocyte compartments, including the appearance of myocardial fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The typical lesion is focal in distribution, is comprised of both fibrous and smooth muscle elements, and the histologic organization is one of dysplastic array. Included among the subjects discussed in functional consequences are coronary spasm, coronary reserve, chest pain, electrical instability of the heart, and comments on the role of focal fibromuscular dysplasia of small coronary arteries in hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure.

In the guinea pig, e.g., the shortening velocity of an intact papillary muscle negatively correlates with the degree of hypertrophy while the shortening velocity of a skinned hypertrophied fiber does not correlate with heart weight. This review is an attempt to summarize quantitatively data concerning membrane proteins in chronic experimental cardiac overload. With that respect, 2 groups of proteins can be distinguished: (1) the group formed by the calcium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Ca2(+)-ATPase) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the beta 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and the low affinity isoform of the Na+K(+)-ATPase. The synthesis of these proteins is not activated by the process of hypertrophy and consequently their density diminished and their total number per myocyte or per ventricle is unchanged. (2) The second group is formed by the calcium channels and the high affinity isoform of the Na+K(+)-ATPase whose density, in contrast, is unchanged or even increases. Their synthesis is therefore stimulated commensurately with the degree of overload and their total number per myocyte is enhanced. These data suggest that search in the field of inotropes must take into account the fact that the keys that these drugs represent must be modeled as a function of the lock they have to fit into.\r"

Because the prognosis of arterial hypertension is determined to a considerable extent by these cardiac complications, the aim of treatment of hypertensive heart disease is reversal of the myocardial hypertrophy in order to prevent later progression to hypertensive heart failure. A further goal of therapy is reversal of the hypertensive small coronary disease in order to improve the coronary reserve. Once the stage of hypertensive heart failure is reached, the principles of medical management of heart failure with digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors apply. Whereas the evidence that regression of hypertrophy can be induced by suitable antihypertensive drugs (calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and sympathicolytic substances) is practically conclusive, clinical evidence of reversal of the hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries has yet to be provided. Moreover, to what extent the prognosis of hypertensive heart disease can be improved by reversal of hypertrophy is still unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac function in myocardial infarction (MI) depends on the extent of damage in ischemic myocardium and the compensatory response of residual myocardium. Because thrombolytic therapy is performed in many patients, reperfusion of ischemic myocardium may take place at various stages of progression of the ischemic insult. If perfusion is reestablished before necrosis occurs, myocardium may recover immediately or after hours to weeks (\"stunned myocardium\"). If coronary occlusion persists, necrosis develops in the subendocardium, propagates transmurally and forms a scar after the healing phase. Residual myocardium responds to loss of contractile tissue and material properties of the ischemic zone by hypertrophy and dilatation. This study shows that left ventricular dilatation is accompanied by an increase in stroke volume from 4 days to 4 weeks; however, left ventricular dilatation progresses while stroke volume remains constant from 4 weeks to 6 months, suggestive of noncompensatory left ventricular dilatation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce lactate production after 60 seconds, and infarct size after 6 hours of coronary occlusion in dogs. Stunned myocardium recovers faster in animal experiments and pacing-induced myocardial ischemia may be prevented by ACE inhibitors. Left ventricular dilatation and mortality is reduced by ACE inhibitors in rats after MI. Several potential mechanisms are discussed to establish a favorable action of ACE inhibitors at various stages of MI. Clinical evidence is still pending; however, large studies are ongoing to clarify potential indications of ACE inhibitors in ischemic heart disease in humans.\r"

Simple treatment schedules may be easily maintained with monotherapy (i.e., beta blockers, diuretics, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). If monotherapy is insufficiently effective, antihypertensive drugs can be combined. Combination therapy makes use of the synergistic effects of most antihypertensive drugs. Further considerations of combination therapy of antihypertensive agents are the inhibition of compensatory mechanisms working against blood pressure reduction and the decrease of the frequency and severity of adverse effects. Combinations of 2 antihypertensive agents usually contain a diuretic or a calcium antagonist.\r"

More research has been done recently aiming at understanding the physiologic importance of LV diastolic dysfunction in hypertension; the preliminary results in this area suggest that LV diastolic dysfunction may be linked to alterations in the regional cardiopulmonary dynamics and in cardiopulmonary receptor activity. More questions, however, need to be answered with regard to the relative and integrative role of the various aspects of LV diastolic function and about the sequential alterations in the various indexes of LV diastolic function in hypertension.\r"

In group 1, both low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and LDL-apolipoprotein B concentrations increased significantly from baseline values (28% and 23%, respectively; p less than 0.05) after treatment. Compared with the placebo group, the increase in LDL apolipoprotein B in both fish oil groups was statistically and clinically significant (p less than 0.05).

A distinction was made between apparent DEVs, derived from UC intake and fecal loss, and partial DEVs, derived from energy intake and fecal loss. By use of a proposed calculation, partial DEVs ranged from -20 to +10 kJ/g (-4.8 to +2.4 kcal/g) in different diets; all values were below the corresponding apparent DEVs. Factors explaining this range, including analytical problems, are considered. Rather than finding discrepancies, both the partial DEVs and the energy available from the whole diet were found to be related to the apparent digestibility of UC (r = 0.88), the proportion of the diet estimated as UC (r = 0.73), and both combined (r = 0.98). Several food-energy evaluation systems are also assessed for accuracy and the implications of these observations for food-energy evaluation are discussed.\r"

In comparison with placebo treatment, magnesium aspartate therapy had no effect on blood pressure, lipid concentrations, or erythrocyte cation metabolism. These results demonstrate that in magnesium-repleted hypertensive subjects, magnesium supplementation does not affect blood pressure or lipids probably because magnesium has no effect on cellular cation metabolism in magnesium-replete individuals.\r"

The approach depends upon the dilution of a single dose of the stable isotope 74SeO3(2-) in the selenite-exchangeable metabolic pool. Data from six metabolic protocols, conducted with healthy North American males, are presented in order to analyze characteristics of this pool. Pool size (WSe-EMP) correlated positively with daily selenium intake in subjects consuming diets of known and variable selenium content. When subjects were given a selenium-adequate or -restricted diet for 30 d, WSe-EMP,7d decreased from 4.49 +/- 0.28 to 3.76 +/- 0.22 mg (p less than 0.05). The corresponding 24-h urinary selenium concentration dropped from 0.556 +/- 0.035 to 0.341 +/- 0.058 mumol/d (means +/- 1 SEM). Route of administration (iv vs po) had no apparent effect on WSe-EMP. In subjects of similar selenium status, the WSe-EMP was reproducible within the expected uncertainties of the method. This approach may be suitable for assessment of selenium status for a wide range of chronic intakes.\r"

It is intended for use as a screening test in physicians' offices, emergency rooms, and other settings where enzyme immunoassays are not practical or available. Concern has been raised over the sensitivity, specificity, and difficulty in interpretation of the agglutination pattern. The authors report on the sensitivity and interobserver variability of the assay as performed in a blinded fashion in a hospital laboratory by technologists experienced with other latex agglutination assays. In the first study, sera from 50 patients positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Abbott HIV EIA) and western blot (WB), performed with EPITOPE HIV western blot strips were assayed by one technologist using the latex agglutination technique. Forty-six samples were positive and four were negative, yielding a sensitivity of 92%. In the second study, 30 samples consisting of 10 negative by EIA and WB, 10 borderline by EIA and/or indeterminate by WB, and 10 positive by EIA and WB were evaluated by three technologists with the latex agglutination technique. There was agreement among all three technologists in 24 of 30 samples (80%). There was disagreement over one sample from the negative group (one technologist obtained a single false positive result), three from the borderline/indeterminate group, and two from the positive group (three technologists obtained false negative results on two samples). In summary, the authors report interobserver variation in interpreting 20% of tests, reflecting difficulty in assessing weak agglutination. Sensitivity of 92% is below that achievable with the EIA or WB techniques and limits the usefulness of the latex agglutination assay as a screening test.\r"

  ".U": "90210047\r", 
  ".W": "The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) established the importance of the time-averaged concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (TACurea) as a determinant of morbidity among patients maintained on hemodialysis. Although urea is not itself toxic, it serves as a surrogate for those low-molecular weight products of protein catabolism that do contribute to uremic toxicity. The NCDS also reported an association between low protein catabolic rates (a measure of dietary protein intake) and increased morbidity, but the validity of this result has been questioned. On the basis of a retrospective re-analysis of the data, Gotch and Sargent have proposed following the normalized whole-body urea clearance, Kt/V, as a more fundamental index of the level of dialytic therapy. In this review, a comparison is made between these two measures of adequate dialysis, namely, midweek predialysis urea concentration and Kt/V. At least for the cellulosic membranes used in the NCDS, they seem to be equivalent. Furthermore, each prescription defines adequate nutrition as a dietary protein intake (DPI) of 1.0 g/kg/d. At this DPI, a time-averaged concentration of BUN of 17.9 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) (corresponding roughly to a midweek predialysis BUN of 21.4 to 28.6 mmol/L (60 to 80 mg/dL), as recommended by the NCDS, is equivalent to a Kt/V of 1.0, as recommended by Gotch and Sargent. Based on ease and accuracy of measurement, TACurea would seem the more reliable marker for monitoring the adequacy of dialysis. Extrapolation of the utility of TACurea and/or Kt/V to noncellulosic membranes remains to be established. Urea kinetic modeling constitutes a powerful mathematical tool for implementing these recommendations. Urea kinetic modeling may also be used as a means of monitoring DPI and thereby ensuring adequate nutrition.\r"

Insulin, epinephrine, and aldosterone all play major roles in maintaining the normal distribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular environment. In addition to hormonal regulation, changes in blood pH and tonicity also exert a strong influence on extrarenal potassium metabolism. Last, the serum potassium concentration per se directly influences its own cellular uptake and this transport mechanism appears to be inhibited by uremia.\r"

  ".W": "During the last decade beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have become one of the first-line treatments for hypertension. Generally, they have been shown to be safe with a low frequency of serious side effects. However, minor subjective symptoms, usually considered to be CNS-related, have been reported for all beta-blockers used. Thus, all beta-blockers on the market seem to have a high benefit:risk ratio; independent of their physicochemical properties and pharmacodynamic profile, however, they seem to cause CNS-related side effects to about the same extent. These minor side effects, the mechanisms of which are unclear, consist of subtle effects on general well being, decreased initiative, a depressed frame of mind, and disturbed sleep. Generally, however, beta-blockers in therapeutic dosages do not affect the qualitative functions of the brain. The results so far available have been obtained primarily by using objective methods. Further comparison has now been initiated using documented subjective methods to investigate whether the objectively documented differences are of any clinical relevance to the patient's quality of life. Although it cannot be claimed with certainty, nonselective beta-blockers seem to cause CNS-related side effects to a greater extent than beta 1-selective blockers. Differences in the degree of hydrophilicity of the beta-blocker are apparently of no clinical relevance in this respect. Rather, the plasma concentration of the beta-blocking drug (degree of beta-blockade) seems to be the major determinant of whether or not CNS-related symptoms appear in susceptible patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of short-term fasting on carbohydrate tolerance, 10 obese women with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were studied with meal tolerance tests before and after 3 days of fasting. After 3 days' fast, basal serum glucose declined from 15.2 +/- 0.9 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 mmol/L (273 +/- 17 to 135 +/- 13 mg/dL) (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001) and the glycemic response to the test meal (area under the glucose curve) improved by 31%. There were no changes in basal or postprandial insulin levels but a slight increase in serum c-peptide. Resting metabolic rate and the thermic effect of food were unchanged. There was a slight but insignificant change in basal and postprandial free fatty acid levels and a significant elevation of basal beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Blood lactate rose significantly (from 0.9 to 2.0 mM) during the initial meal tolerance test, but no rise in lactate was seen in the meal tolerance test after fasting. Two subgroups of patients were identified based on the degree of glycemic improvement after short-term fasting. Those with lesser improvement in serum glucose showed overnight rises in serum glucose during the period of fasting (the dawn phenomenon), while those patients who normalized serum glucose showed a steady fall in serum glucose. This finding may help to predict the glycemic response to long-term calorie restriction. Carbohydrate tolerance improves in obese diabetic (NIDDM) women after 3 days of fasting, in contrast to the impairment of glucose tolerance seen in lean or obese nondiabetic subjects after fasting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most LMWC are irritants and if exposure levels are high enough or if there is extended exposure, can cause inflammation of the eyes, respiratory tract, and alveolar membrane without class specific antibody production or involvement of cellular mechanisms. Reflex or inflammatory bronchoconstriction may result. At lower concentrations, some of these LMWC are haptenic and induce respiratory symptoms by immune mechanisms. Dose and duration of exposure, as well as physiochemical properties of the agent and host factors, influence the effect that a given agent may have on an individual. It is important to distinguish between irritant and hypersensitivity responses for diagnostic purposes and for subsequent patient management. However, long term effects of sub-lethal exposure to primary irritants, such as SO2 or chemicals which are irritants at high concentrations but can also induce antibody formation, such as the isocyanates and acid anhydrides, are not clear.\r"

Although lampreys are one of the most primitive vertebrates, the synaptic physiology and pharmacology are similar to those in the higher vertebrates. Axonal conduction, transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal, postsynaptic response to the putative neurotransmitters, and resting and activated membrane properties were studied in the absence and the presence of various concentrations of ketamine. Ketamine markedly reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated responses, such as depolarizations to bath-applied NMDA and bursting rhythm during \"fictive locomotion.\" The 50% block of the responses took place in the presence of 10-20 microM ketamine, whereas those induced by kainate and quisqualate (the other two subclasses of L-glutamate/L-aspartate agonists) were spared at concentrations higher than 600-800 microM. None of the other neuronal events tested were suppressed in the presence of still higher concentrations of ketamine. The results support the hypothesis that ketamine might exert its anesthetic effect by a pharmacologically specific interaction with the NMDA receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Impulse block by LA occurs through the inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Both protonated and neutral LAs can inhibit Na+ channels though interference with the conformational changes that underly the activation process (the sequence of events that occurs as channels progress from the closed resting state to the open conducting state). The occlusion of open channels contributes little to the overall inhibition. Local anesthetic inhibition of Na+ currents increases with repetitive depolarizations in a process called phasic block. Phasic block represents increased LA binding, either because more channels become accessible during depolarization or because the channel conformations favored by depolarization bind LA with higher affinity. The details of phasic block are dependent on LA chemistry: certain LAs bind and dissociate quite rapidly, others act more slowly; some LAs interact effectively with closed states that occur intermediately between resting and open states, others favor the open channel, and still others have a higher affinity for inactivated states. Channel activation accelerates LA binding, and LAs may bind more tightly to activated and inactivated than to resting channels. In this regard, both the modulated receptor and the guarded receptor hypotheses are valid. In binding to activated and inactivated channels, LAs prevent the conformational changes of activation and antagonize the binding of activator agents that poise channels in activated, open states. These reciprocal actions are one aspect of the concerted conformational rearrangements that occur throughout Na+ channels during gating. The LA binding site may exist in the channel's pore, at the membrane-protein interface, or within the protein subunits of the channel. Judging from its susceptibility to intracellular proteases and its accessibility to LAs with limited membrane permeability (i.e., quaternary LAs in the cytoplasm), the site lies nearer to the cytoplasmic than the external surface of the membrane. Nevertheless, protons in the external medium influence the dissociation of LA from the closed channel. Binding of LAs at the inhibitory site is weak and loose. If one accounts for the membrane-concentrating effects of LA hydrophobicity that are expressed as membrane: buffer partition coefficients equal to 10(2)-10(4), then the apparent LA affinities are low. The equilibrium dissociation constants calculated on the basis of free drug in the membrane are 1-10 mM, with a correspondingly weak binding to the inhibitory LA site. The stereospecificity of LA action is also relatively nonselective, suggesting a loose fit between ligand and binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Clinic assessments showed the same directional trend and final opinions of treatment efficacy were significantly in favor of nedocromil sodium (P = .003, patients; P = .006, clinicians). In addition, the placebo group used significantly more topical (P less than .05) and oral (P less than .01) concomitant antihistamine therapy.

Post-traumatic splenic evaluation is indicated when the mechanism of injury is likely to injure the spleen, there is unexplained hypovolemia, or the patient complains of left upper quadrant pain or tenderness. Peritoneal lavage is indicated when hypovolemia is the main manifestation. Radionuclide study is used for screening isolated splenic or hepatic injury when the suspicion is low. Reduced availability of visceral angiogram has resulted in CT scan becoming the main diagnostic modality. When a patient presents with blunt abdominal trauma, awareness of the problem of splenic rupture and active diagnostic approach may help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with splenic hemorrhage, either immediate or delayed.\r"

Since in psoriasis vulgaris retinoids are used predominantly in combination regimens, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of acitretin and UV-B compared with placebo and UV-B in a double-blind, randomized multicenter trial in 82 patients with severe psoriasis. They were treated with 35 mg of the study medication during the first 4 weeks of therapy and 25 mg thereafter, concomitantly with UV-B irradiation in increasing energy doses. Forty patients who underwent therapy with acitretin and UV-B and 38 patients who underwent therapy with placebo and UV-B were evaluated for efficacy. The target variables--psoriasis severity index and total UV-B dose--were reported at intervals of 2 weeks over a maximum period of 8 weeks. At the end of treatment, the psoriasis severity index decrease was 79% in the acitretin and UV-B group and 35% in the placebo and UV-B group. The response rate, defined as greater than or equal to a 75% decrease of the psoriasis severity index, was 60% for the combination treatment and only 24% for the control treatment. This treatment response was achieved with markedly lower cumulative UV-B energy. The median cumulative UV-B energy applied to reach 75% clinical improvement was 11.8 J/cm2 vs 6.9 J/cm2. Side effects showed a similar pattern in both groups. Our data show that the acitretin dramatically improves the results of UV-B treatment in patients with severe psoriasis. In addition, it markedly decreases the effective cumulative UV-B dose, thereby reducing the potential long-term hazards of UV irradiation. We conclude that the acitretin plus UV-B combination treatment represents a highly effective therapeutic regimen in severe psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "In an 8-week double-blind trial of sulfasalazine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, 23 and 27 patients received the active and placebo tablets, respectively. At the end of the double-blind phase, there were 17 assessable patients receiving sulfasalazine; 7 (41%) had marked improvement, 7 (41%) had moderate improvement, and 3 (18%) demonstrated minimal change. Only 1 patient receiving placebo demonstrated moderate improvement, whereas the rest had minimal improvement or worsening of psoriasis. When the randomization code was broken, patients receiving sulfasalazine were allowed to continue therapy for an additional 4 weeks in an open manner, while those using placebo left the study. Six of 23 patients discontinued sulfasalazine therapy during the double-blind phase because of side effects, 4 due to the development of a cutaneous eruption and 2 due to nausea. Fourteen of 17 patients, who were assessable at the end of the 8-week double-blind phase, completed the additional 4 weeks of sulfasalazine therapy. Of these 14 patients, marked improvement occurred in 8 (57%), moderate improvement in 2 (14%), and minimal improvement in 4 (29%), compared with pretherapy. The low incidence of severe side effects makes sulfasalazine a consideration for oral therapy in patients whose disease severity does not justify use of methotrexate, etretinate, or psoralen plus UV-A, but whose disease severity is too widespread for safe and practical use of topical corticosteroids.\r"

There is, however, no convincing evidence that attempts to reduce the morbidity of severe pancreatitis by early operative pancreatic drainage, early formal pancreatic resection, or early biliary procedures have been effective. In fact, they may be harmful. Peritoneal lavage by catheter induced under local anesthesia may ameliorate early cardiovascular and respiratory complications in some patients. Preliminary experience suggests that early operative debridement of devitalized pancreatic tissue with postoperative lavage may be helpful in selected patients. Patients with infections of devitalized pancreatic or peripancreatic tissue require operative debridement and drainage or packing. Other complications such as colonic necrosis or pseudocysts also require operative treatment. Rarely do patients require operation to relieve protracted pancreatitis. Patients with gallstone-associated pancreatitis should usually undergo surgical correction of their cholelithiasis as soon as their pancreatitis has subsided.\r"

There was an equitable dispersion of perceived risk factors between the groups under study and there were no deaths during the perioperative period. Compliance with follow-up at 3 years was 91%. When success was defined as a loss of more than 50% of excess weight or a current pregnancy, the success rates at 3 years were 17% for gastrogastrostomy, 48% for vertical gastroplasty, and 67% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (p less than 0.001). Although the gastric bypass operation took longer to perform, there were similar outcome patterns for the three groups during the postoperative period. We conclude that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the preferred procedure for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity.\r"

The remaining perioperative fluids consisted of lactated ringers and packed red blood cells. Perioperative coagulation measurements included partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, activated clotting time, platelet count, and bleeding time. Estimated blood loss and the total amount of crystalloid and blood infused were also measured. The surgeon, blind to the colloid used, subjectively rated bleeding on a scale of 1 to 10. There was no significant difference between groups for any measured parameter at any time. Measurements of coagulation function were within normal limits for both groups. Hetastarch does not cause clotting disorders in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, at least if the quantities used in this study are not exceeded.\r"

The mainstays of treatment are mechanical ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In the past decade, many reports have claimed superiority of high frequency ventilation (HFV) in the treatment of ARF. We structured a prospective randomized trial of HFV versus conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure. All patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) were eligible for the study. On admission patients identified for being at risk of developing acute respiratory failure were randomized to receive either HFV or CMV. Patients were treated to the same therapeutic endpoint (pH greater than 7.35, PaCO2 35 to 45 torr, PaO2/FIO2 greater than 225). Daily ventilatory support, fluid and drug requirements, and cardiopulmonary variables were recorded. One hundred thirteen patients were entered into the study. Of these, 100 completed the study (HFV n = 52, CMV n = 48) and 60 developed acute respiratory failure (HFV n = 32, CMV n = 28). Patients on HFV reached the therapeutic endpoint at a lower level of continuous positive airway pressure and mean airway pressure; however there were no differences in mortality, SICU days, hospital days, incidence of barotrauma, number of blood gases, or cardiovascular interventions. This report suggests that HFV offers no concrete advantages over CMV when applied in a prospective fashion for the treatment of acute respiratory failure.\r"

All five symptomatic patients had DVT that originated in the lower extremities. No patient had clinical evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or limb morbidity resulting from the DVT. Follow-up duplex scans in the five asymptomatic and three symptomatic patients showed complete resolution in each case. This study demonstrates the high incidence and natural history of central DVT in a group of critically ill burn patients.\r"

  ".U": "90210760\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) of the chest in the staging of lung cancer, we studied 418 patients with primary pulmonary carcinoma between 1979 and 1986. Each had a preoperative scan performed before detailed operative staging. Each CT scan was analyzed for components of the current TNM staging system. Computed tomography sensitivity and specificity for mediastinal lymph node metastasis were 84.4% and 84.1%, with corresponding positive and negative predictive accuracies of 68.7% and 92.9%, respectively. When TNM stages were derived from CT scans, only 190 of 418 (45.4%) completely agreed with operative staging. An additional 53 of 418 (12.7%) predicted the correct stage, although components of the TNM system were incorrect. In 94 of 418 scans (22.5%) CT overestimated the stage, whereas in 81 (19.4%) CT downgraded the stage. Computed tomography suggested metastatic lesions in liver, lung, adrenal gland, bone, or abdominal lymph nodes in 40 of 373 scans (10.7%); only five of 40 (12.5%) had documented metastasis. In summary, CT of the chest cannot accurately stage primary lung carcinoma according to the TNM classification. Because the negative predictive accuracy for mediastinal lymph node metastasis remains high (92.9%), invasive staging can be deferred for definitive thoracotomy when no lymphadenopathy is evident on CT. The high negative predictive accuracy for scans of the chest and upper abdomen makes CT a useful tool for exclusion of metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Current estimates of the lifetime risk of suicide in alcoholism (11% to 15%) are shown statistically to be untenable. Examination of the mortality from suicide in all published follow-up studies of alcoholics containing the requisite data permits calculation of a much smaller lifetime suicide risk: about 2% in untreated and 2.21% in outpatient-treated probands. Studies of alcoholics identified from hospital admissions yield a lifetime risk of about 3.4% for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries. It is higher in the Scandinavian and European countries with high suicide rates, but not in those with low national suicide rates. The population at risk is shown to be about half of that commonly estimated, and consists of seriously affected alcoholics. While the annual incidence of suicide in the United States is about 1.3% currently, only that quarter of the population identifiably psychiatrically ill is at significant risk. Despite the seemingly miniscule lifetime risk of 2% to 3.4%, the likelihood of suicide in conservatively diagnosed alcoholism is between 60 and 120 times that of the non-psychiatrically ill. Such alcoholism contributes about 25% of the suicides.\r"

Paraffin-embedded sections of livers (five cases each) with acute or chronic obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts, primary biliary cirrhosis (stage II), drug-induced cholestatic liver disease, liver allograft rejection, vicinity of metastatic carcinoma, and massive hepatic necrosis were studied by immunohistochemical methods using three kinds of antiserum against cytokeratin polypeptides of different molecular weights. Bile ductules in diseases involving bile ducts and ductular hepatocytes in massive hepatic necrosis were closely associated with hepatocytes at the limiting plate or with injured hepatocytes. These findings suggest that hepatocytes play an important role in the proliferation of ductular structures or may represent their origin.\r"

Veins cannulated in situ and flushed with cold (4 degrees C) plasmalyte solution served as negative controls. Experimental and control flush solutions were assayed for the presence of neutrophil chemotactic factors with the use of modified Boyden chambers. Chemotactic activity from the distended vein grafts was 2.2 to 7.2 times the control value. Biologic chemotactic activity was demonstrated as well. These results suggest a role for the vein graft itself in the recruitment of neutrophils to implanted veins by releasing chemoattractants.\r"

This multi-institutional study consists of a randomized, prospective comparison of 36 consecutive patients who were treated with either polyurethane foam dressings (group 1, n = 17) or Unna's boot (group 2, n = 19) for venous ulceration of the lower extremities. Ulcer size ranged from 6.0 to 270 cm2 (mean, 32.2 cm2) for group 1 and 0.2 to 600 cm2 (mean, 76.0 cm2) for group 2. Nine (52.9%) of 17 group 1 patients withdrew from the study due to wound odor, while there was 100% compliance in group 2. Overall wound healing was superior in group 2 (18 [94.7%] of 19) as compared with group 1 (7 [41.2%] of 17) (chi 2 = 8.2). The rate of healing was also better in group 2 (0.5 cm2/d) than in group 1 (0.07 cm2/d). Contrary to published European trials, impregnated gauze dressings exhibited superior treatment results when compared with polyurethane foam dressings in the current study.\r"

Those signals generated following infection include interleukins 1, 2, and 6, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (or cachectin). Tumor necrosis factor is the only cytokine, to date, that has been shown to fulfill Koch's postulates and, thus, be casually related to host responses. Host responses to cytokines vary because of alterations in the genetic mechanism that controls cytokine production, because of an alteration in the responsiveness of the reticuloendothelial system at the time of signal induction and because of alterations in cell surface receptors. Only now are techniques evolving that can detect cytokine concentrations or production rates to relate these molecules to varying aspects of human disease. A major therapeutic goal in the future will be directed toward blocking the deleterious effects of cytokines while maintaining their protective or beneficial effects.\r"

Ear specimens demonstrated granulation tissue along with the above features. Conjunctival and ear lesions from these patients were studied histochemically, immunohistochemically, and ultrastructurally. Our studies demonstrate fibrin and albumin deposition as a common feature in all lesions. Deposition of other components, such as mucopolysaccharides, amyloid, immunoglobulins, and mast cells, were, however, variable.

  ".U": "90211697\r", 
  ".W": "Within 24 h of binephrectomy in rats, plasma prorenin (activated by trypsin) rose well above normal levels while renin disappeared. This rise in prorenin may be attributed to enhanced secretion by an unidentified extrarenal source and the lack of any renin formation from it suggests that nephrectomy abolishes any systemic \"convertase\" mechanism that exists for its activation. Within 48 h of adrenalectomy in rats, plasma prorenin levels dropped below normal, while renin rose sharply, suggesting enhanced activation of prorenin to renin, resulting in prorenin depletion, and/or the release of a higher proportion of renin: prorenin by the kidneys. To test for enhanced convertase activity, we crosscirculated adrenalectomized (high convertase) and nephrectomized (low convertase) rats and observed a rapid drop in prorenin with an increase in renin in their shared blood. This was also observed after mixing their bloods in vitro, without crosscirculation, indicating that renal convertase activity was in the bloodstream and not just in the kidneys. Acute nephrectomy of previously adrenalectomized rats lowered renin and raised prorenin within 15 min suggesting a rapid loss of kidney-derived convertase. These results could not be attributed to changes in renin-substrate concentration. The new renin (from activated extrarenal prorenin) was blocked by a monoclonal antibody effective against normal rat plasma renin. It also generated immunoreactive angiotensin I, indicating immunological and biological coidentity with renal renin. The blood of normal control rats did not exhibit convertase activity in vivo or in vitro. These data point to a secretory (endocrine) source of extrarenal prorenin which is stimulated by nephrectomy and to a renal prorenin convertase mechanism which is abolished by nephrectomy and stimulated by adrenalectomy. Thus, in a high renin state, active renin may arise by activation of circulating prorenin (renal and extrarenal) as well as by direct renal release.\r"
