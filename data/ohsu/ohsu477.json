We observed an increased mortality in HBsAg+ patients during 5 to 10 years posttransplantation. However, this could not be attributed to liver disease or dysfunction. Increased mortality and morbidity due to liver disease or dysfunction 10 years posttransplantation suggest that the HBsAg+ patients remain at a higher risk for developing liver disease during that period. In our study, HBsAg+ patients had a 10-year posttransplantation period relatively free of serious liver disease or dysfunction. Furthermore, both HBsAg+ and HBsAg- patients had a similar long-term allograft survival. It is unknown how the use of cyclosporine will affect those survival statistics. We, therefore, believe that HBsAg positivity per se should not constitute an absolute contraindication to transplantation.\r"

Both had early mild steroid-reversible rejections, and the first patient has had an uneventful subsequent course 20 months postgrafting on low-dose cyclosporine and prednisone. The second patient developed a further immunologic event at 1 month that may have been isohemagglutinin mediated or may have been rejection but subsided with OKT3 therapy and plasmapheresis. She lost her graft at 5 months despite normal function during attempts to repair a ureteric fibrosis. Neither patient had donor-specific transfusion or splenectomy.

In hemodynamically stable patients in whom renal injury alone is suspected, we recommend intravenous urography, which will adequately stage 60 to 85 per cent of renal injuries. Computed tomography should be performed if the urography results are equivocal or as the primary study when multiple injuries are suspected. Arteriography can be reserved for patients with suspected renovascular injuries in whom CT scans are inconclusive.\r"

There are no symptoms or signs specific to this injury, and hematuria is absent in one third of the cases. Severe multiple associated injuries are present in almost all cases, with a mortality rate of 44 per cent. Radiologic evaluation with intravenous urography shows nonappearance of the involved kidney. CT reveals nonenhancement of the kidney except for the periphery of the cortex from collateral circulation (rim sign), and renal arteriography shows occlusion of the renal artery or its branches. Despite immediate radiologic evaluation resulting in a short time from injury to diagnosis, most of the patients are not candidates for vascular repair owing to the high incidence of severe associated injuries, especially a second injury to the same kidney. Even with vascular repair, the function of the kidney is not restored to normal. Late hypertension is found in 50 per cent of patients with main renal artery thrombosis managed conservatively.\r"

His commentary summarizes the important messages in this article well: The intent of this report is not to denegrate the splendid advances in nephroscopy and ureteroscopy, but rather to introduce a sobering message that the patient must be informed of the inherent risk of such procedures and that the urologist must be wary of the problems that might occur. Problems have been known ever since endoscopic instrumentation was first introduced, and every experienced urologist has had his share of problems associated with stone extraction and other endoscopic procedures. Traditional teaching in urology has been to eschew manipulation of stones in the upper two thirds of the ureter because the lumbar ureter is mobile and more easily damaged by instrumentation than the pelvic segment. Endoscopic visualization of stones in the upper ureter allowing accurate grasping of calculi would appear at first to provide an element of security heretofore unachievable, but urologists nonetheless should be mindful of the hazards of any type of stone extraction from the upper ureter. Urologists must be ready and equipped to handle emergencies associated with new instruments and techniques, and the patients must be apprised of the exigencies. \"Caveat emptor\" (buyer beware) could not be a more apt or timely maxim in our specialty. Ureteroscopy has greatly aided many patients, and a large number of urologists have integrated this procedure into their daily practices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A delayed presentation with an acute abdomen, absence of voiding, and elevated blood urea nitrogen is sometimes seen in a patient injured during a prolonged alcoholic state or domestic beating, after which the patient is reluctant to seek medical attention, or with a physician misdiagnosis. In patients with pelvic fractures, the incidence of bladder rupture is 6 to 10 per cent. A retrograde cystogram with bladder filling of 400 ml of radiopaque dye followed by a washout film will diagnose intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal ruptures of the bladder. False-negative cystograms occur with penetrating injuries of the bladder when only 250 ml or less of contrast medium is used to fill the bladder.\r"

With these methods, even lengthy defects can be bridged to create a tension-free anastomosis.\r"

  ".U": "89223932\r", 
  ".W": "Times have changed, and urology is not what it was: it is no longer possible for any urologist to be an in-depth expert in more than one or two of its many expanding subspecialist fields--such as pediatric, oncology, reconstruction and functional restoration, stone surgery, gynecourology, neuropathic urinary tract dysfunction, transplantation, fertility, and andrology, etc. Although some techniques for the resolution of urethral strictures, such as dilatation and internal urethrotomy, can be regarded as general urologic procedures, the problems involved in definitive urethral reconstruction should never be underestimated. The potentially complicated nature of a pelvic fracture urethral injury is entirely apparent. It is particularly important to appreciate that an apparently short subprostatic stricture cannot be reliably identified preoperatively as 'simple' and consequently appropriate for a simple perineal approach repair; any surgical failure to resolve a urethral distraction defect inevitably complicates it and may even preclude a subsequent anastomotic retrievoplasty. Thus, surgeons with a general urologic training who do not have both a special additional and ongoing experience of reconstructive procedures and a particular aptitude for the problems involved must be advised that \"having a go\" is not in the best interests of their patients. The prevention of complications is the essence of good surgery and is essentially a personal matter because many contrarily conceived procedures work quite satisfactorily in the hands of others: consequently, many of the views expressed in this communication are essentially personal, and references to personal publications are made to substantiate statements. However, no one is more conscious than I am of the contributions of friends and colleagues across the world who are interested in the most intriguing field of functional reconstruction, and I am also particularly grateful to the many who have most generously referred their patients and thus created the series on which this article is based.\r"

Although the unique vascular properties of the penis have allowed for astonishingly good results in a number of cases of genital amputation injuries, it is certain that microreplantation procedures make for uniformly good results with a minimum of postoperative complications. After microreplantation, the patient is left with a penis that is cosmetically normal and functionally nearly normal or undetectably abnormal. Although microreplantation offers the best results, certainly in the case of penile amputation, if microreplantation technology is not available, the older corporal reattachment techniques should be offered.\r"

Blood at the meatus, any degree of hematuria, and difficulty with urination are suggestive of associated urethral injury, which occurs in 10 to 20 per cent of patients and indicates the need for retrograde urethrography. A review of the literature suggests that early surgical repair of the tunical defect is associated with a significantly lower risk of persistent penile angulation, a shorter hospital stay, and more rapid functional return. Conservative treatment may be warranted in cases with minimal hematoma if cavernosography reveals no extracorporal extravasation. Complete urethral disruption is best managed by primary repair, whereas partial disruption can be managed adequately by temporary suprapubic cystostomy. By following these guidelines, long-term morbidity can be kept to a minimum.\r"

Tensive partial loss of penile skin may require grafting. Potent patients should have thick split-thickness grafts or full-thickness grafts. Impotent patients should have coverage with meshed split-thickness grafts or scrotal flaps when available. Partial scrotal loss is seldom a problem, as local flaps and closure of the defect with the remaining scrotal skin can usually be accomplished. After total scrotal loss, the testicles should be placed temporarily in thigh pouches. Later, a new scrotum can be created with meshed split-thickness grafts or thigh-based cutaneous flaps. Aggressive wound care, appropriate timing of reconstruction, and adherence to basic principles of reconstructive surgery will result in functional recovery and a cosmetically acceptable appearance.\r"

McNeal's definition of three glandular zones (i.e., transition, central, and peripheral) and one nonglandular region (i.e., anterior fibromuscular stroma) has allowed us to identify areas of anatomic weakness through which cancer may escape the prostate. These glandular zones have sites of anatomic weakness through which cancer may easily extend to the extraprostatic space, thus affecting eventual staging. Highly accurate, easy to perform, and readily accepted by patients, strategic ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy can accurately sample all areas within the prostate, including areas of anatomic weakness.\r"

  ".W": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been available for over a decade. Their prime usage has been for the alleviation of pain in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other painful musculoskeletal and organic syndromes. Physicians and patients have accepted that these drugs can cause irritation of the gastric mucosa and even lead to ulceration and bleeding. While these effects on the gastric mucosa are well researched and documented, the effects of NSAIDs on the lower bowel are not sufficiently documented, and it is presumed that these agents do not cause any lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Hence, even in the presence of lower gastrointestinal disease, these agents are prescribed by physicians. Because these agents are capable of causing serious or life-threatening disease, a brief review of the effects of NSAIDs on the lower gastrointestinal tract is presented.\r"

  ".W": "The significance of exercise-induced ST segment depression in supraventricular extrasystoles (STx), in the preceding sinus beats (STs), as well as the significance of the difference between the two of them (STx-s), was studied in 96 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD) (group A)--34 with myocardial infarction (group A1) and 62 without (group A2)--compared to 37 subjects with normal coronary arteries (group B). All patients had supraventricular extrasystoles during exercise testing, the results of which were positive in 72 (75%) patients in group A and six (16.2%) patients in group B (sensitivity 75%, specificity 84%). Among patients in group A STx was greater than STs (1.7 +/- 1.0 vs 1.2 +/- 0.8 mm; p less than 0.001), and STx-s was positive in 70 (sensitivity 73%), whereas in group A2 there were 44 patients with these values (sensitivity 71%). Among patients in group B no statistically significant difference was found between STx and STx (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs 0.6 +/- 0.7 mm; p = NS), whereas STx-s was positive in three (specificity 92%). Among the 24 patients in group A with false negative results of exercise tests, 15 (62.5%) had a positive STx-s, whereas of the 17 patients in group A2 with false negative results, 10 (58.8%) had a positive STx-s. Among the six patients in group B with false positive exercise test results, the STx-s was positive in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the study was to determine if the addition of standard doses (1 and 2 mg/kg) of this new phosphodiesterase inhibitor to conventional therapy (digitalis and diuretics) would alter the clinical and laboratory course of this patient population. Except for a transient improvement in the quality of life score, none of the symptomatology indicators were significantly affected by enoximone. Similarly, maximal exercise capacity was not altered. Enoximone did elicit a statistically significant augmentation of echocardiographic, radionuclide angiographic, and systolic time interval parameters of left ventricular function. These enoximone-induced effects were accompanied by a significant increase (7% to 11%) in resting heart rate. Enoximone is capable of improving ventricular function when added to digitalis-diuretic therapy in moderately severe congestive heart failure. While individual patients may benefit from enoximone, the ability of standard doses of this agent to improve symptoms and exercise capacity over a 16-week period appears somewhat limited in a moderately severe heart failure population as a whole. Furthermore, a disparity between improvement in ventricular function parameters and changes in clinical status and exercise performance is apparent in this heart failure population.\r"

The treatment laser was guided by a 325 nm diagnostic laser that induced fluorescence. The laser system operated through a single 200 or 500 microns optical fiber. Computerized spectral analysis of the tissue fluorescence located at the distal of the fiber tip allowed the treatment laser to be emitted on the atheroma and not on the arterial wall. Uniform success in primary laser recanalization was demonstrated, which allowed for subsequent balloon dilatation in all but one patient. One mechanical fiber perforation, two mechanical fiber dissections, one guidewire perforation, and one guidewire dissection occurred, but no complications resulting from the treatment or diagnostic laser were observed. The safety of the procedure appears to be enhanced by the spectroscopic guidance system, which allows recognition of plaque. The pulsed dye treatment laser was well tolerated and effective even in heavily calcified arteries.\r"

Because captopril therapy is known to improve exercise capacity in this patient population, the potential interaction between LV shape and captopril therapy was also evaluated. Patients underwent cardiac catheterization 2 to 4 weeks after AMI followed by randomization to receive placebo or captopril. LV shape was defined from biplane ventriculography by a sphericity index (volume observed/volume of sphere using long axis as diameter). Quarterly clinical assessments and maximal exercise testing were performed. A cumulative heart failure score, specific activity scale and average exercise time for the year were calculated. A greater shape distortion (increasing sphericity index) was associated with increased LV volumes, decreased ejection fraction and a larger abnormally contracting segment. Sphericity index was the only independent predictor of average exercise duration in the placebo group. Placebo-treated patients in the tercile with the most spherical ventricles had not only the lowest exercise capacity (p less than 0.01), but also accumulated the highest heart failure (p less than 0.05) and specific activity scale (p less than 0.05) scores. Captopril-treated patients with the same baseline distortion of LV shape did not manifest these shape-dependent objective and subjective measures of reduced functional capacity.\r"

The median concentrations before treatment were similar in the IV-APSAC and IC-SK groups (93 and 90 ng/ml, respectively). These were higher than the value in 25 ambulatory control subjects (72 ng/ml) but lower than in 29 post-AMI (6 to 30 hours) patients and in preoperative orthopedic patients (140 ng/ml each). There was no difference in D-dimer concentrations in patients with grade 0 or grade 1 coronary artery occlusion (median 85 vs 90 ng/ml) or in patients with or without ultimate successful reperfusion (median 85 vs 93 ng/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hour after initiation of treatment, the activator activity was highest after APSAC (3.6 +/- 0.9 U), slightly but not significantly less after SK 1.5 X 10(6) IU (3.0 +/- 0.7), and significantly less after SK 500,000 IU (1.6 +/- 0.5) and 250,000 IU (0.6 +/- 0.5), p less than 0.001. After SK, activator activity half-lives were 184 minutes (group B) and 169 minutes (group C), and after APSAC 188 minutes (group D). These were all in agreement with greater than 12 hour duration of changes in other markers of systemic fibrinolysis (euglobulin lysis time) and substrates depletion (fibrinogen, plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin). In extended pilot clinical groups given identical thrombolytic regimens during full anticoagulation with heparin, angiographic coronary patency was found in 83% (35 of 42) after intracoronary SK (group 1), in 73 and 75%, respectively, after 500,000 IU (31 of 43) and 1.5 X 10(6) IU (30 of 40) (group 2 and 3, difference not significant) and 80% (8 of 10) after the 30-U bolus of APSAC (group 4). The overall hemorrhagic risk was 24%, equally distributed among the 4 regimens and mostly (91%) related to catheters. The incidence of bleeding unrelated to vessel puncture was 4%; no deaths occurred.

Qualitative analysis revealed only 3 of 83 patients with any angiographic abnormality at follow-up, 1 with minimal luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery at 1 year, a second with a 50% diameter stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery and minimal irregularity of the proximal circumflex artery at 1 year and a third patient who developed a new 30% diameter eccentric proximal right coronary artery stenosis at 3-year follow-up. The cumulative incidence of graft vascular disease assessed angiographically was therefore 2% at 1 year and 4% at 3 years. Quantitative analysis, however, showed a significant decrease in coronary artery luminal diameter over time.

A range of drugs, including calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-blockers, can be considered as possible first-line treatment. The choice of drug therapy should be individualized and the minimal number of drugs used in the simplest rational regimen. Simple demographic factors and associated diseases, risk factors, and activities should be used to select the most appropriate agents.

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease characterized by localized accumulation of collagen, elastin, lipids, and calcium at sites associated with macrophage infiltration and altered smooth muscle metabolism. Studies in several types of animal models, especially cholesterol-fed rabbits, have shown that calcium competitors, calcium chelators, anticalcifying agents, and calcium antagonists can reduce the accumulation of atherogenic lesion components and decrease the progression of lesions. Although there are some conflicting data in the animal model studies, it is now apparent that several classes of calcium antagonists inhibit the progression of early arterial lesions induced by cholesterol-feeding in animals. The dihydropyridine class of calcium antagonists may be more potent as anti-atherosclerotic agents than the other classes. Mechanisms involving regulation of endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and macrophage metabolism may be responsible for the effects of calcium antagonists on early lesion progression. Recent studies in cell culture-model systems suggest that calcium antagonists may significantly alter activities that regulate lipoprotein-derived cholesterol accumulation by arterial wall cells. Some of these activities are independent of calcium flux across voltage-operated calcium channels. Thus, calcium antagonists may reduce the progression of atherogenic lesions by a combination of decreasing calcium accumulation within arterial wall cells and by altering calcium channel-independent metabolic activities, which affect lesion development.\r"
