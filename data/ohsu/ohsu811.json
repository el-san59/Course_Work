Complementary DNA synthesis was primed from heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA by oligonucleotides derived from conserved regions of human Alu repeats. At least 80% of these cloned sequences were of human origin, providing an enrichment of at least two orders of magnitude. Two clones, one containing a fragment of the primary transcript of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene at Xq26 and another recognizing a family of human genes mapping to two regions of Xq24-qter, were characterized. Additional hncDNA clones mapped to a variety of sites in the Xq24-qter region, demonstrating the isolation of many transcriptionally active loci. These clones provide probes for identification of genetic loci on the terminal region of the X chromosome long arm, which is the location of a number of inherited disorders.\r"

A limited number of TCR V alpha genes were expressed and rearranged in these tumors, and TILs expressing V alpha 7 were found in seven of eight of these uveal melanomas. TCR gene usage is also restricted in experimental autoimmune disease, in T cells within organs like skin and other epithelial tissues, and in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The restricted usage of TCR genes in TIL may indicate that a specific antigen in these melanomas is targeted.\r"

  ".W": "The factors responsible for the unusual susceptibility of the hippocampus to seizures and ischemic cell damage are not well understood. The CA1 pyramidal subfield of the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to seizure activity and damage after ischemia. The possibility was examined that regional differences exist in extracellular volume, which might influence neuronal excitability and response to injury in the hippocampus. CA1 stratum pyramidale exhibited an exceptionally low extracellular volume fraction (EVF) of 0.12, whereas the EVFs of CA3 and dentate were considerably higher--0.18 and 0.15, respectively. The EVF of CA1 stratum pyramidale was reversibly reduced by 30 percent when the extracellular potassium concentration was raised from 3.5 to 8.5 mM, a procedure that induced spontaneous electrographic seizures in CA1. Thus there are regional variations in the properties of the extracellular space in the hippocampus that might underlie the propensity of the CA1 region to develop seizures and to suffer damage after ischemia.\r"

The TCR consists of two chains (alpha and beta) that are complexed to the five or more nonpolymorphic CD3 polypeptides. A soluble form of the TCR was engineered by replacing the carboxyl termini of alpha and beta with signal sequences from lipid-linked proteins, making them susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. In this manner, TCR heterodimers can be expressed independently of the CD3 polypeptides and in significant quantities (0.5 milligram per week). This technique seems generalizable to biochemical and structural studies of many other cell surface molecules as well.\r"

Computerized discharge abstracts showed that 111 adults died without contraindications to organ donation. Manual review of these 111 medical records yielded 68 records suitable for review by Tennessee Donor Services. From this group 10 eligible donors were identified. Physicians failed to ask the families of three patients, families of three patients refused organ donation, and one patient had cardiovascular collapse before the donation process could be completed. Organs were successfully donated from three patients. All eligible donors died of intracerebral hemorrhage or drug overdose. Failure of physicians to approach families for donation was not based on medical criteria, and it resulted in organ wastage. As a result of this study, we have developed a simplified audit process for hospitals to use in evaluating compliance with required request legislation.\r"

Transplantation of 18,277 kidneys, 3425 hearts, 2957 livers, and 411 pancreatic grafts (as well as smaller numbers of lung, intestine, heart-lung, and multivisceral grafts) represented an organ utilization rate exceeding 90%. Organ sharing was common and had a beneficial effect overall. Renal allografts from multiorgan donors showed better early function and long-term survival. A steady decrease in organ wastage has been accompanied by a substantial increase in numbers of cadaveric multiorgan donors. The resource of life-saving cadaveric organs is effectively and widely dispersed, allowing increasingly common treatment of end-stage organ failure by transplantation.\r"

All adult patients with blood cultures positive for S pneumoniae from January 1987 through April 1989 at two acute care general hospitals in northern California were identified by review of microbiology data. One hospital served veterans, the other the indigent of a suburban area. Six (15%) of 41 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia were HIV seropositive; five were not known to be HIV seropositive before the onset of bacteremia, and the sixth was asymptomatic with respect to HIV infection. No patient with AIDS had pneumococcal bacteremia. HIV seropositive patients were significantly younger, had significantly fewer underlying diseases, and had fewer complications of pneumococcal bacteremia than bacteremic patients with no risk factors for HIV infection. Patients with pneumococcal bacteremia should be evaluated for HIV infection, especially in the absence of other underlying diseases that predispose to pneumococcal bacteremia.\r"

Stroke symptoms were classified as atherothrombotic cerebral infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and multi-infarct dementia. The groups were compared according to the occurrence of these symptoms, and both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs were used to study 293 consecutive patients referred to this laboratory and to contrast groups with and without diabetes. Hypertension, heart disease, and stroke symptoms and signs were more frequent among diabetics than among age-matched nondiabetics. Among diabetics, strokes occurred at an earlier age and were more common among men. Regression analyses assigned diabetes second to hypertension as a risk factor for stroke, followed by heart disease and smoking. Diabetes associated with hypertension or hyperlipidemia added significantly to stroke risk. Initially, cerebral blood flow values and cognitive test scores were equivalent among diabetics and nondiabetics; after 3 years, cognition became significantly impaired among diabetics, despite better maintenance of cerebral blood flow among treated diabetics compared with nondiabetics. Diabetes acts to compound risk for stroke not only by promoting cerebral atherogenesis but also by aggravating other risk factors including hypertension, heart disease, and hyperlipidemia.\r"

  ".W": "Gastroesophageal reflux is the main complaint after intrathoracic gastroplasty for carcinoma of the esophagus. Eighteen patients who underwent intrathoracic gastroplasty were studied by 24 hour pH monitoring. Two groups of patients were separately evaluated according to the surgical procedure performed--group 1, nine patients with tubulized stomach and gastroesophageal anastomosis at the apex of the thorax, and group 2, nine patients without tubulized stomach and with low gastroesophageal anastomosis. Gastroesophageal reflux and gastric function were analyzed. Gastroesophageal reflux was clinically present in 36 per cent of patients. During the 24 hour pH monitoring period, the percentage of time that the esophageal electrode showed a pH value of less than 4 was shorter for group 1 than for group 2 (13.3 +/- 11.3 versus 32.7 +/- 21.7), indicating less gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric secretion was also studied with 24 hour pH monitoring. Gastric secretion was reduced after gastroplasty, compared with a control group. Gastric secretion was identical between groups 1 and 2. Tubulization did not impair gastric secretion. Findings from this study show that good functional results can be achieved after intrathoracic gastroplasty if the anastomosis is performed on the neck or at the apex of the thorax. This technique can reduce gastroesophageal reflux without an antireflux procedure.\r"

If transversus abdominis fibers insert on the superior pubic ramus as a narrow band, a cone shaped defect will result. With an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, preperitoneal fat, with or without a peritoneal sac, can enter this femoral cone. It is an asymptomatic internal hernia that will be detected only if the preperitoneal space is explored during inguinal herniorrhaphy. This is stage I in the development of a femoral hernia. Should the contents within the femoral cone protrude through its narrow distal orifice, a stage II external hernia results. Incarceration or strangulation may then occur. Herniation into and through the femoral cone was encountered in 159 instances while repairing 3,609 hernias of the groin in adults. Sixty-seven external (stage II) hernias were diagnosed preoperatively. Sixteen per cent were irreducible, 18 per cent were incarcerated and 3 per cent were strangulated. During inguinal herniorrhaphy, an unsuspected stage II femoral hernia was found in 12 instances, and a stage I precursor was present in 80. Flexibility in management is important. The choice of the low, inguinal or preperitoneal approach is determined by the mode of presentation of the hernia.\r"

To investigate the long term effects of this procedure, 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring was performed on three occasions: preoperatively, four weeks and two years postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were assessed. In 13 patients, fundoplication reduced reflux to zero (percentage of time pH less than 4, zero per cent), and in another 11 patients, reflux was reduced to a very low level (percentage of time pH less than 4, 0.75 +/- 0.21 per cent). The procedure failed in three patients, in whom both reflux symptoms and a pathologic pH profile persisted. No significant differences could be demonstrated between reflux variables in the early and late postoperative pH studies. Postoperatively, ten patients complained of heartburn or regurgitation, but pathologic reflux could only be demonstrated in three of these, and in two, there was macroscopic evidence of esophagitis. It is concluded that Nissen fundoplication abolishes or nearly abolishes gastroesophageal reflux in the majority of patients. Also, as in patients not operated upon, symptoms are unreliable indicators of the severity of gastroesophageal reflux after an antireflux procedure.\r"

To identify predictors of TE in spite of LDH, 171 patients undergoing abdominal operations and receiving LDH were screened with the fibrinogen uptake test. Diagnosis of TE was confirmed in 24 (14 per cent; 95 per cent confidence limits of 9 to 20 per cent) by either venography or pulmonary scintigraphy, or both, or autopsy. As analyzed by multiple logistic regression, only age, body mass index, preoperative hemoglobin concentration and colorectal operations (yes or no) contributed to the prediction of failure of LDH, whereas sex, malignant lesion, previous TE, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and varicose veins did not. Based on the first 81 patients, an index was constructed that was able to identify 11 of 13 patients with TE and exclude 34 of 68 without TE. This index was then applied on a second series of 90 patients in whom it correctly identified ten of 11 patients with TE and excluded 40 of 79 patients without TE. It is concluded that, with the use of the index, it is possible to identify a group of patients undergoing elective abdominal operations in whom LDH is not sufficient prophylaxis. A practical approach to bedside prediction of failure of LDH prophylaxis by use of a simple score table is suggested.\r"

Detubularized augmentation cystoplasty was performed upon six patients, simultaneously with sphincter implantation in three patients and in two stages in the others. Seventeen patients reported \"good\" continence, and three reported continence as \"fair, improved.\" The four failures occurred in patients in whom the sphincter had been extracted because of erosion and infection of the bladder neck cuff. A total of 12 revisions were necessary, nine during the first two years after sphincter implantation (0.5 revisions per patient). Two patients who had successful pregnancies underwent deactivation of the sphincter in the third trimester. Strict attention to surgical principles, postoperative care and careful selection of patients have made the AS-800 artificial sphincter a reliable option in treating intractable sphincteric incontinence in females.\r"

The use of RLT should increase the pool of available donors and decrease the number of pediatric patients who die while awaiting a full-size hepatic graft. Between May 1988 and April 1989, 15 RLT were placed in 12 patients. Twelve were left lobe and three were extended right lobe grafts. The mean donor to recipient ratio was 9.0:1.0 (range of 3.3:1.0 to 19.9:1.0). Graft complications occurred in four RLT, and extrahepatic complications occurred in five patients. Preservation of grafts with University of Wisconsin solution was used in all instances, with a mean preservation time of 14.1 hours (range of 8.5 to 19.5 hours). Retransplantation with RLT was successful in three of four patients. The actual patient survival rate was 83 per cent after a mean follow-up interval of 6.7 months (range of one to 11 months). Our experience indicates that patient survival with RLT is comparable with full-size grafting and should be offered as an acceptable method of therapy for end-stage liver disease in pediatric patients. The application of RLT techniques in a more elective setting may yield further improvements in patient survival.\r"

Intussusception was confirmed in 157 patients, 92 of whom underwent successful reduction by barium enema (59 per cent). Sixty-four were treated with laparotomy (41 per cent). Of these 64, 34 were reduced manually (22 per cent) and 30 required resection (19 per cent). Two patients died (1.3 per cent). Our experience is in general agreement with that of other reported series, and we conclude that hydrostatic barium enema reduction is the treatment of choice for intussusception during childhood. Laparotomy should be reserved for those patients in whom the barium enema was unsuccessful.\r"

Although 1.9 per cent currently were testing all patients for HIV, 42.6 per cent of surgeons believed that all patients in their hospital should be tested. Of the surgeons who responded, 6.3 per cent refused to treat any patient infected with HIV. Less than 50 per cent recommended the use of barrier precautions on all patients in their hospital. Surgeons in New York City were significantly more likely than those in Philadelphia to favor separate facilities for HIV-infected patients. Surgeons considering themselves at higher occupational risk were more likely than those at lower risk to favor widespread testing, separate facilities and use of precautions. Surgeons reported a wide range of opinions. Their approach to the use of barrier precautions differs from the Centers for Disease Control recommendations. The patterns observed suggest that distinct policies may be appropriate for different hospitals.\r"

We tested tamoxifen's ability to augment the antitumor activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine capable of expanding and activating lymphocytes, in the treatment of established pulmonary metastases of the weakly immunogenic murine fibrosarcoma MCA-106. Age-matched C57BL/6 female mice bearing pulmonary metastases induced by a tail vein injection of MCA-106 tumor suspension (5 x 10(5) cells/mouse) were treated from days 3 through 12 with intraperitoneal saline solution or IL-2 (50,000 units twice a day). Half of the mice in each group received plain and the remainder received tamoxifen-treated (2 units/ml) drinking water ad libitum for the duration of the experiment. All mice were killed on day 18 for enumeration of pulmonary metastases. Compared with saline-treated control mice, IL-2 and tamoxifen reduced metastases by 66% (p less than 0.0002) and 30% (p less than 0.005), respectively. IL-2 and tamoxifen combined reduced metastases 95% (p less than 0.0002), significantly better than did IL-2 (p less than 0.02) or tamoxifen (p less than 0.0003) alone. In vitro, tamoxifen inhibited proliferation of the weakly estrogen receptor-positive MCA-106 tumor by approximately 30%. Tamoxifen had no effect on the generation of 3-day IL-2-activated lymphocyte cytotoxicity against both natural killer-sensitive (YAC) and natural killer-resistant (MCA-106) target cells. Both YAC and MCA-106 tumor became more resistant to lysis with increased concentration of tamoxifen. This is the first demonstration of in vivo potentiation of IL-2 antitumor activity by tamoxifen and suggests its possible use clinically.\r"

After incubation with virus, infected mucosa was heterotransplanted under the renal capsule of syngeneic animals and monitored for progression toward malignancy by use of histologic and immunofluorescence techniques. Although v-myc alone induced focal hyperplastic change, more dysplastic lesions were observed after expression of the src oncogene product in urothelial implants. In contrast, lesions induced by myc and src acting cooperatively were highly proliferative, displaying evidence of tumor formation within the 6-week study period. The presence and expression of myc and src oncogenic proteins, associated with preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, was confirmed by use of Southern blot analysis and an immune complex kinase assay, respectively. These results indicate the formation of histologically distinct preneoplastic change elicited by the action of a single oncogene with induction of neoplastic changes when such oncogenic elements act cooperatively. This model provides an opportunity to study the action of different oncogenes throughout bladder neoplastic progression in vivo.\r"

Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by lavage 24 hours later. Antigen presentation was measured by coculturing peritoneal macrophages with the D10.G4.1 helper T-lymphocyte clone. Immune associated antigen (Ia) expression was determined by direct immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-1, 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) levels in peritoneal macrophage supernatants were measured by use of cytokine-specific cellular assays. Hemorrhage caused a significant decrease in peritoneal macrophage antigen presentation function, Ia expression, and IL-1 and IL-6 synthesis in the vehicle-treated group, whereas TNF levels were increased. However, both doses of diltiazem significantly improved peritoneal macrophage antigen presentation, Ia expression, and IL-1 synthesis. IL-6 synthesis was only increased with high doses of diltiazem, whereas both diltiazem doses decreased TNF production. These results indicate that the calcium channel blocker diltiazem can markedly improve macrophage functions after hemorrhage. The use of diltiazem might offer a new therapeutic modality in the treatment of immunosuppression and in decreasing the susceptibility to sepsis after hemorrhagic shock.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 275 to 325 gm were subjected to a 50% total body surface area, full-thickness scald burn. At the time of injury, osmotic pumps were surgically implanted and used to deliver IGF-I, 1000 micrograms/day, or an equivalent volume of placebo solution by constant infusion of 5 microliters/hr for 14 days. Metabolic rates were studied with oxygen-consumption measurements performed on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 after injury. Animal weight measurements were also performed at the above intervals, with serum total IFG-I levels measured at death. Total serum IGF-I levels were decreased significantly 14 days after injury compared with uninjured animals (p less than 0.05). Treatment with IGF-I resulted in a significant decrease in oxygen consumption and a significant increase in body weight compared with burned animals and those treated with placebo 10 and 14 days after injury (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that IGF-I causes a significant change in the metabolic response that follows severe thermal injury and point to a possible role for IGF-I in the treatment of patients after severe thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a polypeptide hormone structurally related to insulin with insulin-like metabolic effects. It is a potent mitogen, eliciting cell multiplication in tissue culture by increasing deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis. IGF-I was found to promote the growth of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells. We studied the in situ distribution of IGF-I receptors in different arteries of the rabbit by autoradiography and examined their binding characteristics in the wall of the thoracic aorta. The thoracic and abdominal aortas and carotid, superior mesenteric, renal, and iliac arteries of three adult New Zealand rabbits were harvested and stored at -70 degrees C. Autoradiographic analysis of 125I-labeled IGF-I binding to frozen arterial sections showed that silver-grain density was consistently located in the arterial wall. Binding studies in the thoracic aorta demonstrated high-affinity IGF-I receptors with a dissociation constant of 2 nmol/L and maximum IGF-I binding capacity of 4.17 pmol/mg protein. Inhibition studies with insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II showed that these binding sites were more specific for IGF-I than for IGF-II or insulin, with a concentration of peptide that inhibits 50% of maximum binding of 1.75 nmol/L, 5 nmol/L, and greater than 100 mumol/L, respectively. The presence of high-affinity, specific IGF-I receptor binding in rabbit arteries suggests that IGF-I plays an important role in regulating the multiplication of arterial smooth muscle cells; a role that may prove important in different pathologic processes.\r"

We evaluated the effect of transfusions on immunologic response to primary and metastatic tumors in multiple rat models. One half of the animals were administered lactated Ringer's solution and one half ACI rat blood at the time of tumor challenge. In 80 rats a slow-growing colon tumor was implanted subcutaneously. At 4 months there were no significant differences in tumor size or leukocyte infiltration of the tumor. Similar results were obtained with a rapidly growing colon cancer. Analysis of T-lymphocyte subpopulations in both groups showed no differences. Rats transfused at the time of intravenous challenge with a suspension of 1 x 10(6) tumor cells had a mean survival time of 38.3 +/- 0.8 days and the control group had a mean survival time of 41.1 +/- 0.8 days (p = 0.016). One week after transfusion, natural killer cell lysis of tumor cells at a 100:1 effector/target cell ratio was 18.0% +/- 1.8% in the transfusion group and 23.0% +/- 1.3% in the control group (p = 0.034). In conclusion, transfusions in multiple rat cancer models did not affect primary tumor growth or the host's immunologic response to it but did significantly impair natural killer cell function and survival with tumor metastases.\r"

In a canine model of unilateral lung allotransplantation, aerosolized cyclosporine was delivered directly to the allograft. Acute rejection was prevented or reduced in all treated recipients. All control animals had severe acute rejection. Intragraft cyclosporine concentration was high and systemic drug delivery was low, as evidenced by low whole-blood cyclosporine levels and low tissue cyclosporine levels in skeletal muscle. Ninety-five percent of whole-blood trough cyclosporine levels were less than 150 ng/ml. Aerosolized cyclosporine was able to prevent or reduce acute pulmonary rejection and resulted in minimal systemic drug delivery.\r"

Therefore we investigated MAb 60.3 treatment in prevention of organ injury after hemorrhagic shock in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We performed esophagogastroscopy and placed catheters to measure cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and urine output. Blood was removed to decrease CO to 30% of baseline for 90 minutes. Just before resuscitation, MAb 60.3 (2 mg/kg) or saline solution (control) was administered intravenously. Monitoring and fluid resuscitation continued for 24 hours, with lactated Ringer's solution given as a maintenance infusion (4 ml/kg/hr) plus additional lactated Ringer's solution to maintain CO at preshock levels. Esophagogastroscopy was repeated 24 hours after shock. There were two deaths in the control group at about 72 hours and none in the MAb 60.3 group. MAb 60.3-treated animals required less fluid (9.6 +/- 8.8 ml/kg vs 263.8 +/- 225.7 ml/kg), gained less weight (0.08 +/- 0.11 kg vs 0.70 +/- 0.37 kg), and maintained a higher hematocrit level (35.0% +/- 1.0% vs 26.9% +/- 4.9%). All five control animals had gastritis; MAb 60.3-treated animals had none (p less than 0.05; Fisher's exact test).

Studies were done in adult rats receiving dexamethasone (0.6 mg intramuscularly/100 gm body weight/day for 2 consecutive days; n = 24) or saline solution (controls; n = 20). Measurements were made in the postabsorptive state and amino acid flux was calculated by multiplying pulmonary blood flow by the right ventricular-arterial concentration difference for glutamine and alanine. Lung glutamine release was 703 +/- 184 nmol/100 gm body weight/min in control rats. This release rate doubled in the dexamethasone-treated rats (1476 +/- 256; p less than 0.05). The activity of the glutamine synthetase enzyme increased by 33% in the dexamethasone-treated animals and there was a 50% decrease in lung glutamine content (p less than 0.01). Likewise, dexamethasone accelerated the release of alanine by the lungs twofold (559 +/- 173 nmol/100 gm body weight/min in controls vs 1113 +/- 184 nmol/100 gm body weight/min in dexamethasone-treated rats; p less than 0.05). The increased release of both amino acids was caused by a significant increase in the concentration difference across the lungs and not a change in pulmonary blood flow. Glucocorticoids appear to be key mediators of the accelerated lung amino acid release that characterizes catabolic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) and TGF alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor messenger ribonucleic acid have recently been demonstrated in isolated parietal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TGF alpha on basal and stimulated secretion in vitro with the isolated rabbit parietal cell model. Acid secretion was assessed indirectly with cell uptake of carbon 14-labeled aminopyrine [( 14C]AP). TGF alpha (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol/L) had no effect on unstimulated [14C]AP uptake. TGF alpha dose dependently inhibited histamine (10(-5) to 10(-6) mol/L)-stimulated but not forskolin (10(-5) to 10(-7) mol/L)-stimulated [14C]AP uptake. This effect on histamine-stimulated activation was reversed by pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) before incubation. TGF alpha had no effect on carbachol (10(-5) to 10(-6) mol/L)-stimulated [14C]AP uptake. Specific HCO3-buffer studies demonstrated that these observations were independent of extracellular buffer and possible TGF alpha effects on intracellular pH. Our data indicate that TGF alpha inhibits acid secretion by specifically uncoupling histamine/cyclic adenosine monophosphate transduction at the guanosine triphosphate-binding protein. TGF alpha, unlike epidermal growth factor, has no effect on carbachol stimulation, which suggests a qualitative difference between the biologic actions of TGF alpha and epidermal growth factor. Possible autocrine-paracrine modulation of histamine stimulation by TGF alpha invokes a novel regulatory mechanism of parietal cell secretion.\r"

To determine whether obese people demonstrate alterations in adenylate cyclase activity that could contribute to the maintenance of obesity by inhibiting lipolysis, we examined human adipocytes from patients who were lean, obese, or formerly obese. Fat samples were obtained from the lower abdomen of 14 women who were morbidly obese (obese group), from 10 women who were formerly morbidly obese and had lost weight after gastric stapling (postobese group), and from 10 similarly aged women of normal weight (controls). Adipocyte adenylate cyclase activity was determined under ligand-free (no stimulatory or inhibitory influences present), hormone-stimulated (isoproterenol, 10(-6) mmol/L), and maximal (cells stimulated with 10 mumol/L forskolin) conditions by measuring cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by radioimmunoassay. The activity of adenylate cyclase was significantly different (p less than 0.01) in the three groups. Adipocytes from obese women had lower levels of cyclase activity under both ligand-free (5% vs 16% of maximal) and hormone-stimulated conditions (76% vs 100% of maximal) than adipocytes from normal women. Postobese women had levels of hormone-stimulated cAMP identical to those of normal women but still had abnormal ligand-free levels (under 5%). These results suggest the presence of an alteration in adipocyte adenylate cyclase regulation in morbidly obese women that is not entirely corrected when weight is lost after food intake is reduced by gastric stapling. This alteration in ligand-free cAMP activity may contribute to the development and maintenance of obesity.\r"

A 100-item test with a stratified sample from a 442-item bank was administered to 72 third-year students in addition to the SSNBME. The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient between the two examinations was 0.61 (p less than 0.001).

Data show that despite fair correlation with SSNBME, significant deteriorations in both test item performance and reliability occur with the use of a local examination at a nonlocal site. This likely results from problems with content validity at the nonlocal site.

JDNv was performed by stripping the adventitia from the superior mesenteric artery and vein, transecting the small bowel mesentery, and division (with reanastomosis) of the small bowel at the ligament of Treitz and ileocecal junctio. Introduodenal corn oil (3 ml/kg/hr) was given before JDNv and 1 and 2 months after JDNv. Intravenous bombesin (400 pmol/kg/hr) was given (on nonconsecutive days) before JDNv and 1 month after JDNv. Plasma PYY and cholecystokinin levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. Release of PYY was enhanced after JDNv. The integrated release of PYY (ng.[0 to 60 min]/ml) after intraduodenal corn oil was as follows: before JDNv, 4.1 +/- 1.2; 1 month after JDNv, 16.0 +/- 2.7; and 2 months after JDNv, 10.3 +/- 2.2. Similar results were noted with intravenous bombesin (3.7 +/- 0.9 [before JDNv] vs 12.0 +/- 0.7 [1 month after JDNv]). Corn oil-stimulated release of cholecystokinin was abolished after JDNv (before JDNv 2.2 +/- 1.1; 1 month after JDNv, 0.6 +/- 0.3; and 2 months after JDNv, 0.4 +/- 0.6). Basal plasma levels of PYY and cholecystokinin were not affected by JDNv. We conclude that JDNv enhances PYY and abolished cholecystokinin release, which provides evidence for different mechanisms of neural control.\r"

  ".W": "Adenocarcinomas of the colon arise from adenomatous polyps. We hypothesized that sucrase-isomaltase (SI), a glycoprotein hydrolase, found in normal small intestine, fetal colon, and colon carcinomas is a marker associated with progression of adenomatous polyps with dysplasia to adenocarcinomas. To examine this hypothesis, we performed immunostaining using a polyclonal antihuman SI antibody in 32 adenomatous polyps with varying degrees of dysplasia. In addition, sucrase enzyme activity was determined in three sets of simultaneously harvested polyps, cancer, and adjacent normal mucosa from the same patient. All severely dysplastic polyps (6/6) exhibited SI staining. Most polyps (85%) with 3+ staining (i.e., greater than 10% of polyp positive for SI) had severe dysplasia, whereas those with mild dysplasia had either 1% to 5% staining or no staining in 95% of the cases. These data indicate that the extent of SI immunostaining in polyps correlates with the degree of dysplasia (p = 0.0001). Sucrase-isomaltase activity in the polyps was 18.1 +/- 1.8 mU/mg (mean +/- SD); in adjacent carcinoma SI activity was 29.1 +/- 1.8 mU/mg. Adjacent mucosa showed no activity in all cases. In summary, our results suggest that SI expression correlates with the progression of dysplastic adenomatous polyps to carcinoma. Sucrase-isomaltase expression may be useful as a clinical marker to improve our prognostic capabilities in patients with dysplastic lesions of the colon, that is, inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Human ECs grown in culture were incubated in control medium or medium containing aspirin (100 mumols/ml) and then attached at saturation density by incubating EC suspensions (6 x 10(5) cells/100 microliters) within EAS for 20 minutes. Nonendarterectomized aortic segments and untreated EAS served as negative and positive controls, respectively. The inhibitory effect of aspirin treatment on EC production of prostacyclin was confirmed by radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolic breakdown product, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in supernatant medium. Thrombus formation in vivo was measured as the accumulation of indium 111-labeled platelets on endarterectomy sites in real time by scintillation camera imaging. 111In-labeled platelets were deposited rapidly, reaching a plateau by 60 minutes of 4.40 +/- 0.89 x 10(9) platelets/cm, compared with 111In-labled platelet deposition on nonendarterectomized segments of 0.89 +/- 0.26 x 10(9) platelets/cm (p = 0.008). Coverage of EAS with normal cultured ECs significantly reduced platelet deposition on EAS (1.05 +/- 0.45 x 10(9) platelets/cm; p = 0.009 at 1 hour compared with EAS not incubated with ECs). Aspirin-treated ECs also produced a marked reduction in platelet disposition (0.71 +/- 0.24 x 10 platelets/cm; p = 0.007 compared with EAS without ECs) that was equivalent to the effect of non-aspirin-treated ECs (p greater than 0.5). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the antithrombotic effects of attached ECs. We conclude that endarterectomy of normal arteries produces a highly thrombogenic surface and the thrombogenicity is abolished by acutely attaching cultured human ECs.\r"

  ".W": "Unregulated increases in intracellular calcium levels with subsequent cytoskeletal disruption have been implicated in tissue injury caused by oxygen free radicals (OFRs). The purpose of these experiments was to study the kinetics of free intracellular calcium in endothelial cells on exposure to exogenous OFRs and investigate the mechanisms of this altered homeostasis. Monolayers of endothelial cells were labeled with a calcium-sensitive probe and exposed to exogenous OFRs generated with hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase. Intracellular calcium changes were monitored dynamically by continuous measurement of fluorescence with a spectrofluorometer. A sustained rise in intracellular Ca++ levels reaching a peak at 5 minutes was observed. This effect was blocked by superoxide dismutase and catalase. Removal of calcium from the medium or chelating the extracellular calcium with ethyleneglycoldiamine tetraacetate significantly blunted the response to OFRs (p less than 0.05). Preincubation of the cells with verapamil did not alter the observed increase in Ca++i. Addition of another divalent cation (Mn++) to the medium partially blocked the rise in calcium levels (p less than 0.05). Membrane potential measurements assessed fluorometrically, with the fluorescent probe bisoxonol, demonstrate a transient hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane on exposure to OFRs, temporally associated with the rise in [Ca++]i. In summary, OFRs cause an increase of intracellular calcium in endothelial cells. This response is dependent on extracellular calcium and independent of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The increase can be partially inhibited by other divalent cations. These results suggest that the transformation of the plasma membrane components (lipid peroxidation and cross-linking of proteins) caused by OFRs may produce cation ionophores.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine if glutamine can help cells after oxidant injury has been initiated and to demonstrate the mechanism of its action. The activity of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was measured in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to H2O2 (0 to 10 mmol/L). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely inhibited by 10 mmol/L H2O2 after 1 minute, resulting in inhibition of glycolysis. The endothelial cells were then exposed to 10 mmol/L H2O2, with glutamine (2 mmol/L) being added at different times in relation to the injury. ATP levels were monitored during a 3-hour time course, and short-term viability was measured 6 hours after addition of the oxidant. Significant improvement of endothelial cell ATP levels and short-term viability was seen with addition of glutamine as late as 15 minutes after addition of H2O2. Mitochondrial inhibition with oligomycin (650 nmol/L) abolished the protective effect of glutamine on ATP levels and short-term viability. Cellular survival at 24 hours was not enhanced by glutamine, which suggests that ATP may not be the only factor determining long-term survival after oxidant injury.\r"

Histologic evidence indicates that the vascular endothelial cell (VEC) is involved in both humoral and cellular aspects of xenograft rejection. To study this phenomenon murine VEC and splenocytes were used in a mixed lymphocyte/endothelial cell culture and in a mixed lymphocyte culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as responders. The VEC is a much better stimulator than the splenocyte. Removal of macrophages and B cells from the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells has no effect on the response to the VEC. The VEC acts as a target for humoral responses in the complement-dependent cytotoxicity and the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The VEC is killed in these two assays, which indicates the importance of the VEC in humoral rejection. These data indicate that the VEC is an important cell in xenogeneic immune reaction and may be pivotal in xenograft rejection.\r"

  ".U": "90341949\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic ventricular hypertrophy caused by pressure overload is a common associated risk factor in congenital cardiac surgery. Because calcium controls contractile protein interaction, we postulated that inducing ventricular hypertrophy from birth alters the way myocytes are able to regulate free cytosolic calcium (Cai) during ischemia. In this study we measured Cai with a recently developed intracellular fluorescent probe trapped inside myocytes by deesterification. The probe shifts its fluorescence spectra (from 380 to 340 nm; fluorescence measured at 510 nm) when it binds to calcium in direct relation to Cai. We studied the effects of ischemia at 37 degrees C (up to 50 minutes) on Cai in newborn (3 to 5 days), adult control (2 to 4 months old), and hypertrophied (2 months old; aortic banding done at 10 days) isolated retroperfused rabbit hearts loaded with Fura-2. In a separate group of hearts (n = 6 per group) we measured isovolumic peak developed pressure with an intracavity balloon in hearts subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia at 37 degrees C and 30 minutes of reperfusion. The recovery of peak developed pressure (percent of preischemic control) was 101% +/- 6% in control, 85% +/- 4% (p less than 0.05 vs control) in newborn, and 67% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05 vs control) in hypertrophied hearts. Cai-dependent fluorescence rose to 160% +/- 30% of preischemic baseline levels by 30 minutes of ischemia in control versus a decline to 55% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05 vs control) in newborn and 51% +/- 2% (p less than 0.05 vs control) in hypertrophied hearts by 30 minutes of ischemia. We conclude that hypertrophied and newborn hearts have a lower Cai during ischemia compared with adult hearts, and this is associated with a worse recovery of cardiac function. The lower Cai may be the result of irreversible binding of calcium to contractile proteins.\r"

Doxorubicin is a potent antitumor drug that has been shown to have detrimental effects on wound healing. With specific complementary DNA probes for TFG-beta and type 1 collagen, RNA from wounds of rats treated with saline solution and doxorubicin was analyzed for the expression of each gene at different times after wounding. In a second study, either 2 micrograms exogenous TGF-beta or vehicle was added to wounds of rats treated with doxorubicin, and wound RNA was analyzed in a similar manner. In wounds from rats treated with saline solution, messenger RNA (mRNA) for TGF-beta peaks on day 7 after wounding and is also elevated on days 3 and 10; mRNA for collagen is elevated on days 7 and 10. Doxorubicin decreases mRNA for TGF-beta and collagen on each day. Topical application of TGF-beta to wounds of rats treated with doxorubicin increases collagen mRNA levels to normal or supranormal levels. This study suggests that the impaired healing induced by doxorubicin may be a result of decreased gene expression for TGF-beta and that topical replacement of this growth factor may correct the defect.\r"

A unique model system of a gastric incision was developed to test the potential of polypeptide growth factors to enhance wound healing. Paired, deep partial-thickness incisions to but not including the gastric mucosa were made. A single topical application of transforming growth factor, type beta 1 (TGF-beta), platelet-derived growth factor, or control vehicle at the time of wounding was given. Wound breaking strength and detailed histologic analyses of wounds were evaluated as a function of time after wounding. TGF-beta (0.1 to 2.0 micrograms/wound) demonstrated a bimodal, dose-dependent acceleration of wound breaking strength 7 days after gastric wounding. An approximate 4-day acceleration of gastric wound breaking strength by TGF-beta (2 micrograms/wound) was seen at 7 and 11 days. Wounds treated with platelet-derived growth factor (10 micrograms/wound) displayed an increased cellular response but no enhancement of breaking strength at 7 and 11 days. These results demonstrate the ability of TGF-beta to accelerate gastrointestinal tissue repair by topical application and suggest significant potential for the use of growth factors in enhancing repair of surgical wounds of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

In this study the effect of oral arginine supplementation on human collagen synthesis and T-cell function was studied in 36 healthy, nonsmoking human volunteers. While volunteers were under local anesthesia, a 5 cm segment of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (1 mm outer diameter, 90 mu pore size) was inserted subcutaneously into the right deltoid region. The volunteers were then randomized into three groups that were given the following substances: (1) daily supplements of 30 gm arginine hydrochloride (24.8 gm free arginine); (2) 30 gm arginine aspartate (17 gm free arginine) daily; or (3) placebo. The supplements were given orally for 2 weeks; dietary intake was not controlled. Mitogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A were assayed at the start of study and at 1 and 2 weeks after supplementation. At 2 weeks the catheters were removed, and the amount of hydroxyproline was determined as an index of new collagen synthesis and deposition. Arginine supplementation significantly enhanced the amount of collagen deposited into a standardized wound as assessed by the amount of hydroxyproline present (10.1 +/- 2.32 nmol/cm graft in controls vs 17.57 +/- 2.16 nmol/cm in the arginine aspartate group, [p = 0.028] and vs 23.85 +/- 2.16 nmol/cm in the arginine hydrochloride group [p less than 0.001]). In parallel, arginine supplementation at both doses increased lymphocyte mitogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. The data suggest that arginine may be of clinical benefit in improving wound healing and immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adaptive cytoprotection of gastric mucosa could be demonstrated with concentrations of bile acid, which is normally found in the human stomach, and whether cyclooxygenase inhibition, in turn, could blunt the response. Surface epithelial cell exfoliation and ion fluxes were used as end points. A transduodenal gastric cannula was placed, and the pylorus/gastroesophageal junction was ligated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been anesthetized. In experiment 1 (N = 30), rat stomachs were exposed for 15 minutes to 5 ml of either a neutral test solution (160 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7) or 1 mmol/L acidified taurocholate (ATC) (100 mmol/L HCl, 60 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L taurocholic acid; pH 1.2). All rats were subsequently exposed for 15 minutes to 5 mmol/L ATC during which time mucosal injury was assessed by measuring net flux of H+, Na+, and K+, volume, and DNA efflux. In experiment 2 (N = 35), all stomachs were pretreated for 15 minutes with 1 mmol/L ATC before mucosal injury with 5 mmol/L ATC (15 minutes). Eighteen rats were pretreated with indomethacin (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously 75 minutes before the experiment was begun, and the same parameters were measured. Pretreatment of rat gastric mucosa with 1 mmol/L ATC significantly attenuated the mucosal injury that was seen with subsequent exposure to 5 mmol/L ATC, resulting in significantly (p less than 0.05) less luminal H+ loss (-16 +/- 4 vs -32 +/- 4 mEq/15 min) and DNA efflux (181 +/- 21 vs 270 +/- 25 micrograms/15 min) than the nonadapted group. Indomethacin pretreatment significantly attenuated the adaptive protective response, resulting in greater loss of H+ (-29 +/- 4 vs -18 +/- 3) and DNA efflux (190 +/- 35 vs 110 +/- 18, both p less than 0.05) after exposure to 5 mmol/L ATC. These studies demonstrate that adaptive cytoprotection of gastric mucosa occurs with physiologic concentrations of an irritant that is normally present in the stomach. Indomethacin blunts this effect, which suggests that adaptive cytoprotection in this setting may be mediated by production of endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

  ".U": "90341956\r", 
  ".W": "Within the acidic milieu of an abscess or tumor, macrophages must be able to maintain their cytoplasmic pH (pHi) close to the physiologic range to ensure optimal cell function. Our recent studies have demonstrated that a proton-extrusion mechanism with the characteristics of an H+ adenosine triphosphatase mediates pHi recovery in acid-loaded macrophages. These studies were designed to examine the role of these H+ pumps in maintaining cell function in an acidic extracellular environment. Peritoneal macrophages were tested for superoxide production in response to phorbol myristate acetate at either physiologic or acidic extracellular pH (pHo; 7.35 or 6.70, respectively). pHi was measured with the fluorescent dye 2',7'-biscarboxy-ethyl-5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein. Bafilomycin A1, a specific H+ adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, was used to examine the contribution of the H+ pump to pHi regulation and cell function. At pHo 7.35, bafilomycin A1 had no effect on pHi or phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated superoxide production. However, at pHo 6.70, bafilomycin A1 reduced pHi to 6.61 +/- 0.01 versus 6.79 +/- 0.01 in control cells (p less than 0.001) and caused a concomitant reduction in superoxide production to 4.8 +/- 1.2 versus 13.0 +/- 1.2 nmol/10(6) cells/40 min in control cells (p less than 0.001). To determine whether the observed reduction in superoxide formation was the result of the pHi reduction, superoxide production was measured in cells whose pHi was pharmacologically clamped at various levels according to the K+/nigericin method. Lowering pHi from 6.80 to 6.60 caused a significant reduction in superoxide production from 13.1 +/- 1.8 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 nmol/10(6) cells/40 min (p less than 0.01). Thus H+ extrusion pumps are important to maintenance of macrophage pHi at low pHo, permitting continued superoxide production under these conditions. By keeping pHi close to the physiologic range, these pumps serve to optimize cell function in an acidic extracellular environment.\r"

Fasting small-bowel myoelectric activity and culture results were compared in six animals undergoing handsewn end-to-end and functional end-to-end anastomoses. Serosal electrodes were placed at 10 cm intervals, and the small bowel was divided 25 and 55 cm from the ligament of Treitz. The functional end-to-end and end-to-end techniques were performed in each animal in random order. Fasting myoelectric recordings were obtained at weekly intervals for up to 20 weeks after operation. New electrodes were placed, and additional recordings were obtained from 29 to 39 weeks, 51 to 63 weeks, and 108 to 112 weeks after operation. The recordings were visually inspected for passage of phase 3 of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC). By 12 to 20 weeks after operation, 91% of MMCs crossed the end-to-end anastomoses versus 22% across the functional end-to-end anastomosis (p less than 0.001). Even 2 years after surgery only 56% of MMCs crossed the functional end-to-end anastomosis. Quantitative bacterial cultures suggested a trend toward bacterial overgrowth in the functional end-to-end anastomosis. These results demonstrate that the functional end-to-end anastomosis alters small-bowel motility to a greater degree than an end-to-end anastomosis and may predispose to bacterial overgrowth.\r"

On the average, residents in the Wright State University program spent 90.1 +/- 27.1 hours in the hospital per week. Direct patient care activities required 62.7 +/- 18.8 hours (69.6%) of the average workweek. Purely educational endeavors accounted for 10.0 +/- 6.1 hours (11.1%) of the workweek. Ancillary tasks consumed an average of 8.5 +/- 8.5 hours (9.4%) of the surgical residents' time on duty per week. House officers did obtain a mean of 9.1 +/- 11.0 hours of sleep in those working hours (10.1% of the total time spent in the hospital). Although much variation existed among hospitals in the program, on-duty hours were greater in the private hospitals compared to the federal hospitals; the principal difference was the amount of time spent doing ancillary tasks (10.0 +/- 9.4 hours vs 5.6 +/- 5.6 hours; p less than 0.01). Hours worked by residents on private surgical services were longer than those of residents assigned to staff services (96.4 +/- 22.1 hours vs 86.0 +/- 29.3 hours; p less than 0.04). Again, the major difference was the greater amount of ancillary tasks performed by residents on private services (12.0 +/- 9.5 hours vs 6.2 +/- 7.0 hours; p less than 0.001). This finding could not be attributed to differences in patient census or turnover rates. Longer hours were noted on the general/thoracic surgery services compared to other surgical subspecialties (94.1 +/- 27.3 hours vs 81.5 +/- 24.8 hours; p less than 0.02). More time was spent in direct patient care on general/thoracic surgery (66.3 +/- 19.3 hours vs 54.9 +/- 15.1 hours; p less than 0.002). Despite the shorter workweek, residents on subspecialty rotations spent more time doing ancillary tasks (11.3 +/- 9.7 hours vs 7.3 +/- 7.6 hours; p less than 0.02). More than 60% of the residents' working hours in this program exceeded the arbitrary 80-hour limit, emphasizing the challenge of complying with the imposition of maximum work hours. We recommend that each program closely monitor the activities and hours of its residents to best respond to the pressures for regulation.\r"

Biopsy-derived donor-reactive cytotoxic T-cell lines were generated regularly from recipients of low-dose, but not high-dose, OKT4A during periods of stable function. All animals treated with monoclonal antibodies developed an immunoglobulin G antimurine humoral response. Thus OKT4A is a potent immunosuppressive agent administered even as a single bolus, and depletion of CD4 cells is not required to suppress rejection. Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies may prove useful in patients, perhaps requiring only a limited number of higher-dose injections in the peritransplant period.\r"

This study examines these treatment modalities further. Pretransplant donor antigen as 25 x 10(6) ultraviolet B-irradiated (12,000 joules/m2) donor spleen cells was given 7 days before heart transplantation through either the PV or systemic venous (IV) routes. On day 0, Lewis-to-Buffalo rat cardiac allografts were drained either into the PV or IV. Pretransplant PV donor antigen administration (p less than 0.005), but not by IV administration, significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival across the strong RT 1 rat histoincompatibility barrier. Similarly PV, but not IV, drainage of the graft prolonged graft survival (p less than 0.005). Pretransplant IV antigen administration had no additive effect on PV drainage graft survival. In contrast, when pretransplant PV donor antigen was combined with PV drainage, 11 of 14 allografts (p less than 0.001) continued to function, free of rejection, after 150 days. Therefore for rat cardiac transplants a clearly synergistic graft-prolonging effect results when pretransplant PV donor antigen is combined with PV drainage of the allograts. These data clarify the potent tolerogenic effects of alloantigen not only administered into the PV but also continuously shed intraportally so that it is first processed by the liver.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of the amino acid L-glutamate or the oxygen free-radical scavengers superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) during extended periods of cold storage would improve ventricular function. Fifteen rabbit hearts were placed on a Langendorff apparatus, arrested with crystalloid potassium cardioplegia, stored in iced saline solution (3 degrees C) for 5 hours, and then reperfused at 37 degrees C for 1 hour. In five hearts L-glutamate (4 mmol/L) was added to the cardioplegic and reperfusate solutions, and five hearts received SOD (1500 units/kg/L) and CAT (3500 units/kg/L), whereas in five others the cardioplegic and reperfusate solutions were unmodified. Hearts treated with L-glutamate had the best recovery of positive dP/dt (79%* glutamate vs 49%* SOD and CAT vs 36% unmodified), negative dP/dt (76%* glutamate vs 53% SOD and CAT vs 45% unmodified), developed pressure (67%* glutamate vs 51% SOD and CAT vs 45% unmodified), and coronary flow (81%* glutamate vs 79%* SOD and CAT vs 62% unmodified). We conclude that substrate enhancement with L-glutamate provides superior myocardial protection than is possible with the oxygen free-radical scavengers SOD and CAT during extended periods of cold storage for cardiac transplantation.\r"

Lewis anti-ACI hyperimmune sera (Ab1) were obtained from animals that have rejected successive ACI skin grafts. Purified immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM fractions were obtained from the sera. These putative \"idiotypic antibodies\" (IgG fractions) were used to immunize groups of five naive Lewis rats. Purified Ig (0.5 mg) was mixed with 0.5 ml incomplete Freund's adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally -15, -7, and -3 days before and at the time of ACI cardiac allografting. The median allograft survival time was 11.2 +/- 0.7 days in animals treated with Ab1 compared with 6.4 +/- 0.5 days in untreated control rats (p less than 0.001). Use of IgM with adjuvant did not prolong graft survival. Purified IgG obtained from sera collected before transplantation was tested for antiidiotypic antibodies with the complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay. For this, serial dilutions of the hyperimmune serum were tested for cytotoxicity against ACI lymphocyte in the presence of Ig from sera collected after immunization with Ab1. Blocking was demonstrated by sera and IgG obtained from Lewis rats that received anti-ACI IgG (Ab1) with adjuvant. The blocking activity of purified IgG (Ab2) was strain specific because it did not block the reaction of Lewis hyperimmune sera against third-party Wistar-Furth rats. Thoracic duct lymphocytes from immunized recipients showed no blastogenic responses when tested in in mixed lymphocyte culture for reactivities against splenocytes from ACI rats. The finding that Lewis rats treated with Ig from sera containing anti-ACI antibodies exhibit impaired anti-ACI T- and B-cell reactivity and prolong allograft survival suggests that pretreatment of recipients with idiotypic antibodies leads to development of antiidiotypic antibodies that modulate alloreactivity suppressing allograft rejection.\r"

Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a method of biventricular cardiac massage that avoids contact of blood with various surfaces. The purpose of this study was to compare hemodynamic responses and organ perfusion between DMVA and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Twenty adult mixed-breed dogs randomized for DMVA or CPB were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. During 4 hours of ventricular fibrillation, animals received either DMVA or CPB with aortic arch perfusion (90 to 120 ml/kg/min), bicaval venous return, and full left ventricle venting. Hemodynamics and organ perfusion were assessed by multivariant analysis of variance with repeated measures. Blood flow was similar to normal sinus rhythm (control) with either method; however, average CPB flows (control, 110%) were increased significantly over DMVA flows (control, 75%) (p = 0.016). The resulting mean arterial pressures were significantly greater during DMVA (control, 66%) compared to CPB (control, 49%) (p = 0.0011). Radiolabeled microspheres were the measure of organ perfusion during sinus rhythm and at 2 and 4 hours of circulatory support. Myocardial blood flow was equal to control in all regions during DMVA; CPB resulted in increased flows to the left ventricular epicardium, septum, and right ventricle. DMVA generated significantly greater flows to the renal cortex. All other organs demonstrated similar perfusion with either method. However, CPB displayed declining cerebral flows at 4 hours compared to DMVA (42% vs 55% control, respectively). Overall, DMVA provided hemodynamic stability equal to that of CPB. Rapid application and avoidance of blood/surface contact make DMVA a favorable method of temporary circulatory support.\r"

Protein synthesis was measured as incorporation of carbon 14-labeled phenylalanine into protein. Total and myofibrillar protein breakdown rates were assessed as release of tyrosine and 3-methylhistidine, respectively. Administration of TNF alone did not affect muscle protein turnover rates. Corticosterone inhibited muscle protein synthesis and stimulated total and myofibrillar protein breakdown. When TNF was administered together with corticosterone, total and myofibrillar protein breakdown rates were increased further compared with rats treated with corticosterone alone. Because plasma corticosterone levels in rats treated with both TNF and the glucocorticoid were higher than in animals treated with corticosterone alone, it is possible that muscle proteolysis noted after TNF, injected together with costicosterone, was caused by the high glucocorticoid levels. To test that hypothesis, corticosterone alone or in combination with TNF was injected in rats that had undergone adrenalectomy. In these experiments, TNF did not increase plasma corticosterone levels or muscle protein breakdown rates. The results suggest that muscle catabolism induced by administration of TNF is mediated by glucocorticoids.\r"

We investigated the role of exogenous and endogenous glutathione (reduced glutathione, GSH) in gastric mucosal injury associated with hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion. Mucosal GSH content was found to be consistently higher in the antrum than in the corpus. Ischemia (hemorrhage to 25 to 30 mm Hg) followed by retransfusion of shed blood, but not ischemia alone, caused a marked drop in gastric mucosal GSH and gross mucosal injury, which was confined to the corpus and spared the antrum. Chemical depletion of gastric mucosal GSH with diethylmaleate or inhibition of GSH synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine increased mucosal injury in the corpus and also rendered the antral mucosa susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Pretreatment with exogenous GSH provided marked protection against gross mucosal ischemia/reperfusion injury and prevented the ischemia/reperfusion-induced drop in mucosal GSH. These data suggest that the mucosal availability of the antioxidant GSH is an important protective factor against the development of gastric mucosal ischemia/reperfusion injury and supports a major role of oxygen radical release in the pathogenesis of gastric ischemia/reperfusion injury.\r"

At residual volume the mean (SD) maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure was 163 (18) cm H2O (1 cm H2O = 0.0981 kPa). With increasing lung volume the maximum pressures generated declined, so that at 95% of total lung capacity the mean pressure was 68 (15) cm H2O. Mouth pressures showed a similar relation to lung volume. At residual volume the mean maximum mouth pressure was 74 (8) cm H2O, compared with 38 (6) cm H2O at 95% of total lung capacity. The relation between pressure and lung volume was linear for measurements at lung volume levels between residual volume and 85% of total lung capacity; values at 95% of total lung capacity, however, were lower than predicted from the linear regression of the other points. The use of a second order polynomial regression showed a higher coefficient of determination in all cases (0.72 and 0.69 for transdiaphragmatic and mouth pressures on the basis of all pressure values for all subjects). Sniff generated mouth and transdiaphragmatic pressures show a predictable dependence on lung volume, supporting their use as measures of global inspiratory muscle power and diaphragm strength respectively.\r"

The median urinary cotinine concentration was 1623 ng/ml in the smokers and 6.1 ng/ml in the non-smokers. In smokers the average urinary cotinine concentration increased with reported habitual cigarette consumption; in non-smokers it increased with the reported total seven day duration of exposure to other people's tobacco smoke. Cotinine concentrations were approximately three times higher in non-smokers living with a spouse or partner who was a smoker than in those living with a non-smoker; their reported duration of exposure to tobacco smoke was also three times higher. Non-smoking subjects who were exposed to any tobacco smoke and who lived with a smoker reported 70% of their exposure to be at home (56% for men and 86% for women); the men reported more exposure at work than non-smoking men who lived with a non-smoker. This study confirms the relation of urinary cotinine to stated tobacco smoke exposure in both smokers and non-smokers and further validates the use of information on the smoking habits of the spouse or partner as a measure of tobacco smoke exposure in epidemiological studies of non-smokers.\r"

After budesonide treatment spontaneous as well as opsonised zymosan triggered prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion from harvested cells was reduced; no such reduction in opsonised zymosan triggered leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production was observed. Neither the capacity to phagocytose opsonised yeast particles nor the superoxide radical generation triggered by the calcium ionophore A23187, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or opsonised zymosan ex vivo were more than marginally affected by the glucocorticosteroid treatment in vivo. Lavage fluid concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), however, after treatment were twice those before treatment and concentrations of fibronectin were reduced to half. Albumin concentrations in lavage fluid were not affected by the glucocorticosteroid treatment. In separate experiments treatment of alveolar macrophages with 10(-7) or 10(-6) M budesonide overnight in vitro did not affect their superoxide radical or PGE2 generation but significantly blocked LTB4 release. These data indicate that inhaled gluco-corticosteroid treatment may affect synthesis or release (or both) of ACE and fibronectin by alveolar macrophages from healthy smokers whereas other functions of these cells, such as the generation of reactive oxygen derived products ex vivo, are only marginally affected.\r"

In one case this was due to blood clots in the pleural catheter and necessitated insertion of a new shunt. The other shunt was removed because of obstructing infected fibrin debris, and a rib resection was performed. There were eight deaths related to the underlying malignancy after a mean interval of 7.3 (range 1.5-23) months.

Ten symptom free patients initially underwent a challenge with methacholine, to determine the dose of methacholine that caused a 15% fall in FEV1 (PD15 FEV1 meth) and a challenge with a specific allergen, to determine the concentration of allergen that caused a fall in FEV1 of at least 15%. On two further occasions they inhaled allergen concentration that had caused the greater than or equal to 15% fall in FEV1 preceded by inhaled frusemide (40 mg frusemide in 4 ml buffered saline) or placebo (4 ml of diluent solution), according to a randomised, double blind, crossover design. All allergen studies were separated by at least seven days. A methacholine challenge was performed two hours after the allergen challenge, a time when the early response to allergen had completely resolved. Frusemide inhibited the early response to antigen, causing mean (95% confidence interval) protection of 87.6% (96-80%) for the maximum fall in FEV1. The increase in non-specific airway reactivity that occurred after antigen when this was preceded by placebo was reduced by frusemide. The mean (95% CI) difference in PD15 values between the placebo and the frusemide days was 1.73 (2.30-1.16) doubling doses of methacholine. These results confirm that frusemide is highly effective in preventing the early response to allergen, and show that it inhibits the increase in reactivity to methacholine that follows the early response.\r"

The airborne mould flora was quantified by repeated volumetric sampling during the winter in three rooms of the homes of 88 children. All of these had previously completed spirometric tests before and after a six minute free running exercise challenge. Total airborne mould counts varied from 0 to 41,000 colony forming units (CFU)/m3, but were generally in the range 50-1500 CFU/m3, much lower than the concentrations found outdoors in summer. The principal types of fungi identified are all known to be common out of doors, and most were found on at least one occasion in most of the homes. Median and geometric mean total mould counts were not related to reports of visible mould in the home, or to a history of wheeze in the index child. The heterogeneous group of non-sporing fungi (mycelia sterilia) were the only airborne fungi present at significantly higher concentrations in the homes of wheezy children (geometric mean 2.1 v 0.7 CFU/m3. A non-significant increase in total mould counts was observed in the homes of children with a 10% or greater decline in FEV1 after exercise (geometric mean 354 v 253 CFU/m3). Questionnaire reports of mould in the home may be a poor indicator of exposure to airborne spores. The total burden of inhaled mould spores from indoor sources is probably not an important determinant of wheeze among children in the general population. Although the association with mycelia sterilia could be a chance finding, these non-sporing isolates may include a potent source of allergen.\r"

Sensitisation increased with age; before the age of 11 only one patient had a positive response to PPD tuberculin and none to any other antigen. This was less than in healthy control subjects of similar age. After age 11 the reactions in sensitised patients were stronger than in positive healthy control subjects. Our study indicates that it is important to consider mycobacterial infection in patients with cystic fibrosis who deteriorate without obvious cause.\r"

Discretionary factors may play an important role in the referral decision. In this study, three family physicians retrospectively rated 410 referrals from a rural academic practice for the need for referral based on lack of specialized skills or knowledge by family physicians and the probability of adverse patient outcome. Referrals relating to cancer and pregnancy were rated as less discretionary than other referrals. Specialties receiving the highest proportion of mandatory or probably mandatory referrals were ophthalmology and cardiology. Half of all referrals studied were considered to be elective or possibly elective, although 97 percent of referrals to dermatology were considered elective or probably elective. These findings support the hypothesis that there is considerable clinical discretion in a large proportion of referrals. Hence, imposition of specific criteria for referral in primary care practice (thereby limiting discretion in initiating a referral) could significantly decrease the number of referrals, and consequently decrease the income of subspecialists and tertiary care centers.\r"

Several case series have implicated hysterectomy as a risk factor for the subsequent development of vaginal neoplasia. A recent case-control study failed to support an association with vaginal cancer when controlling for age, sex, and prior cervical dysplasia or neoplasia. In order to further investigate the possible association of hysterectomy with vaginal neoplasia, we performed the following retrospective case-control study. We compared 39 cases of VAIN with 39 controls matched for age, race, and prior cervical dysplasia or neoplasia. Matched-pair analysis yielded an odds ratio of 7.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.7 to 28. This would suggest that previous hysterectomy is indeed associated with the development of VAIN. However, several potential sources of systematic error were identified in the study design. Thus this association can not be supported. Further, this study exemplifies the difficulty of generalizing study results from a tertiary care population to primary care settings.\r"

Prevalence, frequency, and duration of napping were analyzed with respect to (a) age and sex, and (b) indicators of nocturnal sleep disturbance, including awakenings, latency to sleep onset, and subjective estimates of sleep quality. Age had the greatest effect on napping, with older subjects taking more frequent and longer naps. Although a non-significant trend suggested that the duration of naps may be associated with increased difficulty initiating nocturnal sleep, no significant relationship was observed between any reported napping dimension and indicators of nocturnal sleep difficulty except for a small subgroup who used pharmacologic sleep aids.\r"

Five times as many women were not satisfied with their weight and body image as men. Twice as many women as men felt the overweight condition had a moderate to strong effect on their self-esteem. Women thought about overeating and felt guilty when eating twice as often as men.

Evaluation reveals that the program is feasible for teaching about prevention, and that the following principles are important to consider when implementing problem-based, task-oriented learning in an otherwise traditional curriculum: (1) Be clear in explaining the unique expectations and requirements of small-group learning to students. (2) Limit the duration of any special learning module to less than a week. (3) Take into account the demands of the traditional curriculum when scheduling to minimize competition with traditional examinations.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology and optimal therapy of patients who develop unstable angina in spite of long-term aspirin intake (\"aspirin failure\") have not been well defined. As part of a prospective study of thrombolytic therapy, 19 consecutive patients were identified who were admitted with unstable angina despite long-term aspirin therapy, and they were compared with 12 patients with unstable angina without previous aspirin use. Both groups received urokinase (3.0 million units over 30 minutes intravenously), maximal antianginal therapy, and intravenous heparin. Fibrinolytic system effects were characterized with serial measurements of fibrinogen, d-dimer, and fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) at baseline and over the 24 hours following therapy. In comparison with those without previous aspirin use, the aspirin failure patients demonstrated greater d-dimer production after treatment at all points, the values becoming highly significant at 24 hours (1337 +/- 671 versus 709 +/- 620 ng/dl, p less than 0.02), as well as significantly greater FDPs at all points in the first 24 hours after treatment. Post-treatment arteriography (at 24 to 72 hours) indicated more extensive coronary artery disease in the aspirin failure patients (2.56 +/- 8.3 versus 1.63 +/- 1.06 vessels with greater than 50% stenosis, p less than 0.01) and more severe stenoses of the culprit artery (92.7 +/- 22.9% versus 77.3 +/- 36.9% diameter reduction, p = 0.09). By 7 days, both groups had equally low rates of new ischemic events or infarction (3 of 12 for no aspirin versus 4 of 19 for aspirin failure patients). Despite more extensive underlying coronary disease, unstable angina after long-term aspirin therapy appears to respond equally well to thrombolytic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The population with recent (less than or equal to 30 days) infarction and unstable angina is a subject of controversy. This report reviews the results of angioplasty of 84 vessels in 66 patients with medically refractory unstable angina who had documented myocardial infarction within 30 days of the procedure. Of these 66 patients, 54 had rest angina. Of the 66 patients with angioplasties, 58 patients (88%) had successful procedures. Two patients had technically unsuccessful results in the only vessel attempted; one went to elective surgery and recovered uneventfully and the other patient was in cardiogenic shock at the time of the procedure and died 12 hours later. There were three acute occlusions of infarct-related arteries that were managed medically. There were two (3%) emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. There were two (3%) deaths during the index hospitalization. Of the 58 of 66 patients with technically successful angioplasty, all 58 had no more rest angina, and 46 had a satisfactory predischarge exercise test. All 46 were without angina at exercise. In follow-up ranging from 4 months to 36 months (14 months mean), there have been six cases of restenosis with recurrence of angina treated successfully with repeat angioplasty. There have been five late bypass surgeries. There have been three late deaths. These data, generated by a single operator in a Veterans Administration (VA) center, support the use of angioplasty in patients with unstable angina and recent myocardial infarction. The data suggest that a VA prospective randomized trial of PTCA versus CABG for post-infarction angina may be feasible.\r"

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of coronary angioplasty on regional myocardial function of the infarct zone in patients with angina early after a non-Q wave MI. The study population consisted of 36 patients undergoing successful coronary angioplasty within 30 days of a non-Q wave MI, in whom sequential left ventricular angiograms of adequate quality were obtained before the initial procedure and at follow-up angiography. The global ejection fraction increased significantly from 60 +/- 9% to 67 +/- 6% (p = 0.0003). This significant increase in the global ejection fraction was primarily due to a significant improvement in the regional myocardial function of the infarct zone. The results of the present study show not only that ischemic attacks early after a non-Q wave MI may lead to prolonged regional myocardial dysfunction but more important that this depressed myocardium has the potential to achieve normal contraction after successful coronary angioplasty.\r"

Significant correlates of restenosis were mean luminal stenosis at the conclusion of the procedure and symptom recurrence. Clinical follow-up at a mean of 31 +/- 12 months revealed that coronary artery bypass surgery was more frequent in patients who had an unsuccessful initial angioplasty procedure (7/18 vs 3/26; p = 0.04). Nine patients (35%) who had an initially successful procedure required a second angioplasty for symptomatic restenosis. Angioplasty for totally occluded coronary arteries has a high incidence of restenosis that is often asymptomatic. This procedure can, however, lead to a reduction in the need for coronary artery bypass surgery for symptom control.\r"

Although the end-diastolic volume (153.4 +/- 76.1 ml) and end-systolic volume (100.5 +/- 67.3 ml) at the end of exercise were significantly higher than the respective resting values, stroke volume (52.8 +/- 16.1 ml) and ejection fraction (38.0 +/- 12.2%) were not different from the respective resting values. The recovery of cardiac output was relatively slow compared with that of heart rate, because stroke volume rose sharply early in recovery. The rise in stroke volume was chiefly a result of a significant decrease in end-systolic volume between 1 and 4 minutes of recovery. These changes may result from an immediate afterload reduction coupled with a relatively slow decrease in sympathetic stimulation. The time course of cardiac function during recovery from exercise in cardiac patients is substantially different from that of normal subjects and may be a sensitive way to evaluate the peripheral vascular function and deteriorated cardiac function in cardiac patients.\r"

  ".W": "In subjects without coronary disease, coronary perfusion pressure generated with closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) bears a direct relationship to myocardial blood flow. The effect of coronary lesions on this relationship was studied in an experimental porcine model not requiring thoracotomy. Coronary stenoses (a 50% reduction in coronary cross-sectional area) or total coronary occlusions were created by percutaneous, transarterial catheter placement of a Teflon cylinder in the left anterior descending artery of 21 swine (30 to 60 kg). Coronary perfusion pressure, defined as the aortic diastolic pressure minus right atrial diastolic pressure, was correlated with myocardial blood flow measured with nonradioactive, colored microspheres during external chest compression CPR. Complete occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery resulted in essentially no CPR-generated blood flow to the anterior myocardium distal to the site of occlusion. Coronary perfusion pressure showed a positive correlation with myocardial blood flow above the area of occlusion (r = 0.783; p less than 0.01) but did not correlate with myocardial blood flow below the occlusion site (r = 0.239). In the presence of a patent coronary artery stenosis, coronary perfusion pressure correlated with myocardial blood flow both above (r = 0.841; p less than 0.001) and below (r = 0.508; p less than 0.05) the stenosis. During closed-chest CPR producing coronary perfusion pressures between 30 and 60 mm Hg, anterior myocardial blood flow was 109 +/- 16 ml/min/100 gm above a patent stenosis and 66 +/- 13 ml/min/100 gm below the stenosis (p less than 0.005). Over a wide range of coronary perfusion pressures, myocardial blood flow below a coronary lesion was significantly less than that above the lesion. Coronary occlusions and stenoses can substantially affect the amount of CPR-generated coronary perfusion pressure needed to produce distal myocardial blood flow.\r"

TMR was measured at 10- to 50-second intervals with two wire-mesh patch electrodes in 16 dogs. TTR was measured through two identical low-impedance electrodes. A monophasic exponentially truncated pulse with a duration of 5 msec was used for measurement of TMR as well as TTR. Low-energy pulses of 100 V were used for TMR measurements and pulses of 300 V for TTR measurements. TMR showed an increase of 22.8 +/- 5.14 omega (from 96.2 +/- 12.3 omega) after 600 seconds of uninterrupted VF (p less than 0.0006). TTR showed a change of 2.4 +/- 1.94 omega, which was not statistically significant in comparison with the initial value of 69.0 +/- 11.4 omega. A mathematical model was developed to predict energy delivered to the heart after a transthoracic shock. Observed values of TMR and TTR were used in this model. With the use of this model, the predicted fall in transmyocardial current after 600 seconds of uninterrupted VF and 19.3%, and the fall in energy delivered to the heart was 14%. Our study suggests that increase in TMR may contribute to the observed lack of successful defibrillation during prolonged VF.\r"

  ".W": "This article reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs for the suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations. We analyzed 97 published articles that referred to a total of 27 drugs and contained data from 2989 patient-treatment trials; our goal was to determine the number of patients responding to therapy, defined as greater than or equal to 80% suppression of ventricular ectopic depolarizations. By means of logistic regression we tested the effect of 10 clinical and experimental variables on the likelihood of response to therapy. The likelihood of a drug response was significantly affected by the following six variables: increased by the use of dose titration (t = 3.59, p less than 0.0001), increased by the use of a higher daily dose (t = 3.21, p less than 0.0001), decreased by older age (t-2.67, p = 0.004), decreased by the use of blinding (t = -2.28, p = 0.011), increased by treating more male patients (t = 1.72, p = 0.043), and decreased by the presence of cardiovascular disease (t = -1.52, p = 0.064). Incorporating these six variables into our logistic regression model, we adjusted the response rate in each published study and calculated the mean response and standard error for each drug. Of the drugs tested in at least 100 patients, the most effective were amiodarone (estimated response rate 90%), encainide (80%), flecainide (79%), and propafenone (74%). Class IC drugs were significantly more effective than class IB and II drugs (p less than 0.05). With the exception of lorcainide and moricizine, class IC drugs were also more effective than class IA drugs (p less than 0.05). Amiodarone was significantly more effective than all drugs except encainide and flecainide (p less than 0.05). We found no significant differences among the response rates to class IA, IB, and II drugs. Whereas several patient and study characteristics affect the likelihood of response to antiarrhythmic drugs, class IC drugs and amiodarone are significantly more effective than other drugs in suppressing ventricular ectopic depolarizations.\r"

Fourteen patients with atrial arrhythmias were evaluated with pulsed Doppler echocardiography before and after direct current (DC) cardioversion. The atrial filling fraction increased significantly: 1.14 +/- 4.3% at baseline versus 14.9 +/- 13.3%, 13.4 +/- 11.4%, and 21.9 +/- 13.5% at 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 24 hours, respectively, following cardioversion. Absent atrial mechanical activity was noted in four patients immediately after cardioversion. Mechanical activity resumed by 30 minutes in one patient and at 24 hours in two others. Those with delayed atrial function had lower stroke volumes and atrial filling fractions following cardioversion. An embolic event occurred in one patient who had immediate return of atrial mechanical activity. This patient also had the largest atrial filling fraction of any patient at 24 hours (41%). These data suggest that the degree of atrial mechanical activity following cardioversion is variable and that embolic episodes are not necessarily related to delayed return of atrial mechanical activity following cardioversion.\r"

Among 1215 patients we found 13 (1.1%) with valvular disease (12 with mitral regurgitation and one with aortic regurgitation). We compared these patients with 30 who did not have valvular lesions. The duration of fever was longer and the incidence of coronary artery lesions significantly higher than in those without valvular disease. Heart murmurs disappeared within 2 months after the onset of valvular heart disease in five patients, whereas in another six, all involving valve prolapse, they persisted for 2 years or more. We postulate that two different mechanisms may be responsible for the variation in the duration of valvular heart disease: one, which disappeared spontaneously, was attributed to pancarditis; the other, which persisted, was due to dysfunction in valve and papillary muscles as a result of ischemia.\r"

The initial success rate was 95%, with the peak aortic valve pressure gradient declining from a mean of 82 +/- 32 mm Hg to 44 +/- 23 mm Hg and aortic valve area increasing from a mean of 0.59 +/- 0.15 cm2 to 0.83 +/- 0.40 cm2. One procedure-related death occurred and an additional three patients died less than or equal to 30 days after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. These patients all had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure symptoms prior to the procedure and their mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (28 +/- 7%) was lower than that of hospital survivors (52 +/- 13%) (as was their ratio of left ventricular [LV] wall thickness-to-cavity ratio [0.50 +/- 0.10 versus 0.70 +/- 0.15]). At the time of hospital discharge after valvuloplasty, 76% of patients were asymptomatic or markedly improved (NYHA class I or II). After a mean follow-up of 15.5 months (range 2 to 26 months), however, 10 patients had died and 15 had undergone aortic valve replacement for recurrence of NYHA class III or IV symptoms. The adjusted 1- and 2-year survivals were 0.68 and 0.62, respectively, and adjusted 2-year event-free survival was 0.25. Proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that LVEF less than 40% was the only variable affecting survival (p less than 0.01) and was a possible indicator of event-free survival (p = 0.07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac output was determined by ascending aortic continuous wave Doppler assessment and was measured as minute distance. During intravenous calcium replacement at rest, ascending aortic minute distance increased from 6.75 +/- 1.10 to 9.17 +/- 1.29 m as the calcium level rose from 1.76 +/- 0.08 to 2.06 +/- 0.19 mmol/L without changes in heart rate and blood pressure (p less than 0.01). The peak velocity and acceleration of blood flow derived from Doppler measurement showed a similar rise during calcium infusion. Symptom-limited cycle ergometry was performed before and 3 months after normalization of calcium by long-term oral therapy. Although the resting cardiac output was unchanged, the maximum cardiac output at peak exercise also increased from a minute distance of 11.58 +/- 1.84 to 15.37 +/- 2.28 m (p less than 0.05), together with an increase of maximum heart rate from 136 to 149 beats/min (p less than 0.05). Exercise duration was also prolonged from 11.9 +/- 2.9 to 13.0 +/- 2.8 minutes. Thus hypocalcemia impairs cardiac performance, but this impairment is reversible with calcium replacement.\r"

To determine whether diastolic filling abnormalities are present in hypertension independent of aging and significant hypertrophy, we studied 19 hypertensive patients following a period of 4 weeks when they were not receiving therapy and 18 normotensive subjects matched for sex, age, and LV mass. All subjects had normal systolic function and ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide angiography. We measured peak velocity of early filling (E), late filling (A), and their ratio (E/A) by Doppler echocardiography. Filling indices were abnormal in hypertensive patients, but none of the filling indices were significantly correlated with LV mass. E was inversely related to age (r = -0.62; p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.45; p less than 0.05) in normotensive individuals, but these correlations were not significant in hypertensive patients. E was not significantly correlated to LV mass or wall thickness. In contrast, A was influenced by septal wall thickness and blood pressure in both groups. E/A correlated inversely with age in both normal individuals (r = -0.74) and hypertensive patients (r = -0.51). These findings indicate that diastolic filling abnormalities in hypertension are not solely caused by either LV hypertrophy or by aging and therefore must be in part related to the hemodynamic load or altered myocardial or chamber properties.\r"

For each person in whom the discharge diagnoses included pulmonary embolism, the age, sex, year of admission, and vital status at discharge were recorded. Annual age-sex-specific and age-adjusted sex-specific hospitalization rates were calculated. Similar analyses were undertaken for case fatality. With the exception of men younger than 55 years of age, all groups experienced significant decline in the pulmonary embolism discharge rate. No significant temporal changes were observed in any of the case fatality rates. These data suggest that changes in pulmonary embolism mortality in the United States from 1979 to 1984 may reflect declining occurrence of the disease and are likely not the result of changes in case fatality. Further studies in this area are needed.\r"

The study included sizing the resulting particulate debris. Clot age (1 to 7 days) had no effect on the time required for disruption. Three groups of 1-day-old clots (n = 10 for each) were exposed to the same ultrasonic power source via probes of different lengths. The time required for clot disruption varied approximately as the square of the length for probes of 31, 56, and 105 cm, but was less than 3 minutes even for the longest probe employed. Disrupted whole-blood clot as well as cell-free fibrin clot solutions were analyzed for particulates by the resistive-pulse technique (size range: 2.5 to 80 microns). Debris as large as 80 microns were seen after disruption of whole blood clots, while cell-free fibrin clots contributed little above 40 microns. In all size ranges, whole blood clots produced two orders of magnitude more particulates than cell-free fibrin clots. Addition of streptokinase (7500 U/mL) had little effect on the size distribution of debris, with 99% of all particulates being smaller than 10 microns. D-dimer analysis was performed on the dissolved cell-free fibrin clots with and without streptokinase. While the former had analytically higher D-dimer concentrations than the latter (from eight- to 16-fold), the levels in both cases would be below detectability if measured in vivo. Hence the present study supports the concept that ultrasound can be employed to disrupt human blood clots by mechanisms (mechanical and cavitational) other than fibrinolysis.\r"

For this reason, we conducted a study to compare the plasma concentration profiles of metoprolol and its metabolite, alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (OH-metoprolol), in healthy volunteers and in renally impaired patients. Following a single oral dose of a 14/190 metoprolol OROS (oral osmotic) tablet, plasma metoprolol profiles were shown to be similar for both subject groups. However, in renally impaired patients, renal clearance of OH-metoprolol was reduced and mean plasma levels of OH-metoprolol were increased approximately two- to threefold in comparison with healthy volunteers. The accumulation of OH-metoprolol in plasma, however, is unlikely to contribute to the beta-blocking effect of metoprolol, since OH-metoprolol possesses only one tenth the activity of its parent compound.\r"

In all four studies, lower peak plasma concentrations and longer times to peak were observed after metoprolol OROS than after metoprolol CT, indicating a controlled-release profile for metoprolol OROS. beta-Adrenergic blockade, as measured by reductions in exercise heart rate, was lower after metoprolol OROS than after metoprolol CT, but metoprolol OROS provided a smoother and more sustained beta-blockade. All four doses of metoprolol OROS at steady state produced relative pharmacodynamic bioavailability that ranged from 87% to 104% of that produced by equivalent doses of metoprolol CT.\r"

The patients were phlebotomized after each hemodialysis at any time the predialysis hematocrit was 35% or greater. Over a period of 1 year, the average phlebotomy rate varied from 0.5 to 1.1 U/wk with a mean phlebotomy rate of 45.8 +/- 5.6 U/yr (range, 27 to 57 U). The mean serum ferritin decreased from 8,412 +/- 1,599 micrograms/L (ng/mL) to 3,007 +/- 1,129 micrograms/L (ng/mL), and the mean iron removal over this period was 9.5 g. Liver iron deposition, as measured by density on computed tomographic (CT) scan, improved, while skin color lightened significantly. Patients tolerated phlebotomy with no major symptoms or complications and exhibited no change in the hemogram or serum chemistries. In patients with severe iron overload, changes in serum ferritin with erythropoietin treatment alone may not reflect true change in iron burden. Use of high-dose erythropoietin and phlebotomy is an effective and safe (at least for 1 year) method of reducing iron overload in long-term hemodialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving chronic hemodialysis have impaired exercise tolerance. To distinguish between a central cardiorespiratory and a peripheral skeletal muscular origin for this fatigue, we measured exercise performance and peak oxygen consumption during a maximum exercise test in 10 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. Skeletal muscle function was measured with an isokinetic cycle ergometer and a Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer. Peak rates of oxygen consumption (17.7 +/- 3.6 [mean +/- SD] mL O2/kg/min), blood lactate concentrations (3.4 +/- 0.9 mmol/L), peak heart rates (168 +/- 12 beats/min), and rates of ventilation (37.3 +/- 14.6 L/min) were low, but respiratory exchange ratios (1.1 +/- 0.1) were compatible with maximal effort. There was a significant correlation between isokinetic muscle strength and VO2 peak, exercise duration, peak ventilation, and peak blood lactate concentrations (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001), but not between hemoglobin concentration, total blood hemoglobin content, or hematocrit and these variables. Therefore, in renal dialysis patients, isokinetic muscle strength is a better predictor of exercise capacity than are variables determining blood oxygen carrying capacity. This suggests that altered skeletal muscle function explains the impaired exercise tolerance of anemic patients with end-stage renal disease receiving chronic hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "In most critically ill unstable patients, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration with dialysis (CAVHD) offer significant advantages over dialysis and ultrafiltration. Improvements in CAVH methodology have occurred since its introduction, but an ideal vascular access has yet to be designed. Scribner shunts may result in loss of a future access site, while femoral artery and vein catheterization render the patient immobilized. We have developed a percutaneous external arteriovenous femoral shunt to overcome this difficulty. The catheter consists of two single-lumen flexible polyurethane catheters with a subcutaneous Dacron cuff. A percutaneous Seldinger technique is used with a peel-away sheath to insert one catheter in the artery and one in the vein. To minimize infection and ensure durability, a 10-cm tunnel is created so that the exit of the catheters on the upper thigh is away from the groin. Like the Scribner shunt, a connecting tube is used between the catheters to maintain the patency when the shunt is not in use. Our experience with this technique is limited to seven treatments in seven patients (five CAVH, two CAVHD). Good blood flow (average, 80 mL/min), ultrafiltration rate (7 mL/min), and biochemical studies demonstrated the efficiency of the access. The average treatment was 10 days and patients were allowed to do moderate movement without resulting thrombosis or infection of the access. The major advantages of this new and efficient access for CAVH and CAVHD include simple introduction by a nephrologist, lack of potential serious complications, avoidance of sacrifice of major vessels, early ambulation and movement without compromising function, and a design for prolonged usage.\r"

The remnant group underwent right nephrectomy and infarction of one third of the left kidney, yielding constant proportions of remnant deep and superficial nephrons, while the bromoethylamine (BEA) group underwent right nephrectomy and chemical ablation by BEA (50 mg intravenously [IV]) of the deep nephrons of the left kidney, leaving superficial nephrons. Ten weeks following ablation, greater whole kidney permselective defects indicative of worse injury occurred in the remnant group compared with the BEA group, as manifested by increased excretion of total protein (.65 +/- .14 v .23 +/- .04 g/d [65 +/- 14 v 23 +/- 4 mg/24 h]; P less than 0.05) and greater fractional clearance of albumin (71.8 +/- 42.1 v 9.0 +/- 3.4 X 10(-4); P less than 0.05) and IgG (17.9 +/- 10.2 v 3.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(-4); P less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were similar in the ablated groups, but lower than a sham-operated control group. Superficial single nephron GFR (SNGFR) and mean glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) were elevated similarly in the ablated groups compared with the control group. Based on the differences in the two models, the site of the increased proteinuria in the remnant group could be the deep nephrons and/or the nephrons adjacent to the scar.\r"

  ".W": "Oral calcitriol is commonly used for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing long-term dialysis, but it has been suggested that intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration enhances the therapeutic efficacy of the sterol. To examine potential mechanisms for this difference, the bioavailability of calcitriol was evaluated after single oral (PO), IV, and IP doses of 60 ng/kg in each of six adolescent patients with osteitis fibrosa undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Serum calcitriol levels were 3.6 +/- 4.3, 8.2 +/- 7.5, and 2.5 +/- 3.0 pg/mL, respectively, before IV, PO, and IP doses of the sterol; these values increased to similar levels at 24 hours: 55.6 +/- 14.6 pg/mL after PO, 56.4 +/- 17.6 pg/mL after IV, and 53.8 +/- 20.1 pg/mL after IP. Serum calcitriol levels were higher 1, 3, and 6 hours after IV injections than after PO or IP doses; values thereafter did not differ among groups. The bioavailability of calcitriol, determined from the 24-hour area under the curve (AUC0-24) for the increase in serum calcitriol concentration above baseline values was 50% to 60% greater after IV, 2,340 +/- 523 pg.mL-1.h-1, than after PO, 1,442 +/- 467 pg.mL-1.h-1, or IP, 1,562 +/- 477 pg.mL-1.h1, dosages, P less than 0.05. These differences were due to higher values for AUC during the first 6 hours after calcitriol administration. Although IP calcitriol did not increase sterol bioavailability, radioisotope tracer studies indicated that 35% to 40% of the hormone adheres to plastic components of the peritoneal dialysate delivery system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), unlike continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), provides freedom from daytime exchanges and is associated with lower rates of peritonitis. However, catheter infection (CI) rates have not been reported for CCPD. Previous data suggested that a CAPD disconnect system (Y-set) was associated with lower rates of CI. These results suggested that patients on CCPD, which is also a disconnect system, might also have low CI rates. We evaluated our CCPD patients for infection rates and compared them with two groups of matched control CAPD patients, one using a spike system and one a Y-set disconnect system to evaluate this hypothesis. The CCPD patients had the lowest rates of CIs (0.5 episodes per year or one episode every 25 months), followed by the CAPD patients using the Y-set (0.8 episodes per year or one episode every 14 months). CAPD patients using the spike system had the highest rates of CIs (1.2 episodes per year or one episode every 10 months). Peritonitis rates followed the same pattern among the patient groups: CCPD, 0.3 episodes per year; CAPD, Y-set 0.5 episodes per year; CAPD, spike system 1.3 episodes per year. Our data suggest that disconnect systems, such as the CAPD Y-set and CCPD, reduce CIs, as well as peritonitis.\r"

Data on all episodes of peritonitis (n = 360) and catheter infections (n = 507) were gathered prospectively from January 1984 to December 1988. The numbers of patients on peritoneal dialysis each year ranged from 136 in 1984 to 109 in 1987. Fifteen methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections (MRSI) related to outpatient peritoneal dialysis occurred. Three were due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus found in infected exit sites (2.3% of all S aureus catheter infections). Two of these infections occurred in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient who carried methicillin-resistant S aureus in his nares. The other 12 methicillin-resistant organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci that caused peritonitis. There was a significant increase in the percentage of episodes of coagulase-negative staphylococci peritonitis caused by methicillin-resistant organisms; from 5% (3/57) in 1984 through 1986 to 28% (9/32) in 1987 through 1988 (P less than 0.005). In view of the high percentage of coagulase-negative staphylococci peritonitis that is methicillin-resistant, vancomycin rather than cephalosporins should be used for initial treatment.\r"

The number of Research Career Development Award (RCDA) applications declined by 66% for MDs and by 53% for PhDs, accounting for a 32% reduction in the number of active RCDAs held by MDs and a 60% reduction in active RCDAs held by PhDs from 1985 to 1988. MD scientists submitted more applications, had higher award rates, and received more RCDA awards than did PhD scientists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reinfection or reactivation of latent hepatitis B infection (HBV) has been reported in certain groups of immunosuppressed patients, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). We report the reactivation or reinfection of HBV with resurgence of hepatitis B surface antigen in a dialysis patient coinfected with HIV-1. Thus, in dialysis patients with latent HBV infection, with undetectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels, the potential exists to reactivate during immunosuppression associated with HIV-1 infection and/or end-stage renal disease. Reinfection with a different subtype is also possible. The development of hepatitis B surface antigenemia in this patient population creates a potential for transmission in the dialysis setting. This is of special concern since the number of patients infected with HIV-1 and with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection is increasing in urban units.\r"

However, to date, no measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aluminum concentrations after deferoxamine exist. We report the case of a patient who developed acute neurological deterioration in conjunction with sepsis and elevated serum aluminum levels shortly after renal transplantation. Simultaneous values for blood and CSF aluminum were measured in response to deferoxamine and hemodialysis. The increase in CSF aluminum levels appears to parallel that seen in serum after deferoxamine. We hypothesize that this elevation in CSF aluminum may account for the observed neurologic deterioration after deferoxamine and postulate various pathophysiologic mechanisms that might be involved.\r"

  ".U": "90342752\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. Further, the increased risk of mortality from type I diabetes is almost entirely confined to patients developing clinical diabetic nephropathy. Nonetheless, kidney biopsy has had little role in the clinical assessment of diabetic patients or in the design of clinical research in diabetic nephropathy. The development of dipstick-positive proteinuria in patients with type I diabetes of more than 10 years' duration is regularly associated with advanced structural changes of diabetic nephropathology; in these patients, clinical parameters, especially the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), are accurate monitors of disease progression. Microalbuminuria indicates a very high risk of overt proteinuria and thus ESRD. This increased risk is associated with levels of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; greater than 30 micrograms/min [45 mg/24 h]), which are frequently accompanied by hypertension and reduced or decreasing GFR. At this stage, lesions of diabetic nephropathy are usually already well established. Thus, microalbuminuria is more a marker of early nephropathy than a predictor of later renal injury. Before these clinical stages of nephropathy, there are no accurate predictors of renal risk. Renal biopsy may serve this role by indicating those patients who are developing significant lesions during the \"silent\" phase of the disease. In large measure, this value of the biopsy derives from evidence that the lesions tend to develop linearly over time and can be measured by techniques that are relatively easily established in standard surgical pathology environments. Renal biopsies can serve to assure the majority of diabetic patients that they are developing serious lesions slowly, if at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autoimmune markers were measured in 47 patients with biopsy-proven ALD and compared to measurements in 20 alcoholics without clinical and hematologic evidence of ALD and 28 patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (CAH). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of patients with ALD were antinuclear antibody-positive, compared to 71% of patients with CAH. Approximately 60% of patients with ALD had either anti-single-stranded or anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, slightly more than the patients with CAH. Another marker of autoimmunity, as in systemic lupus erythematosus, is the presence of IgM antibodies to autologous and heterologous lymphocytes, which are cytotoxic at 4 degrees C. Seventy-two percent of patients with CAH had positive antilymphocyte antibodies, compared to 59.6% of patients with ALD. Furthermore, more than 90% of the sera from ALD and CAH patients displayed lymphocytotoxicity. Thirty-two percent and 25.5% of CAH and ALD patients, respectively, had all three autoantibodies present. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that autoimmune mechanisms may indeed play a role in the pathogenesis of ALD in at least some patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of clinically relevant bacteremia after upper endoscopy in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 151 patients who received an HLA-identical allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) at the Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center between September 1983 and December 1988. Forty-seven patients who required esophago-gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during their first 100 days after transplant were selected for evaluation. Clinically relevant bacteremia was defined as the development of hypotension, temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C, and a positive blood culture occurring within 24 hours after endoscopy. The presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at the time of endoscopy and the use of prednisone prior to endoscopy were considered possible risk factors for the development of bacteremia. The proportion of subjects who became bacteremic were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Within 24 hours following endoscopy, nine patients (19%) developed clinically evident bacteremia (hypotension, temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C, and a positive blood culture). Eight of 14 patients receiving prednisone at the time of endoscopy developed bacteremia, compared to one of 33 not receiving prednisone (p less than 0.01). Nineteen patients had acute GVHD of at least grade 2 at the time of EGD, six of whom developed bacteremia. Although acute GVHD alone did not increase the risk of post-EGD bacteremia in patients not receiving prednisone (one of 21 versus zero of 12, p greater than 0.9), the risk of bacteremia was particularly high in patients with acute GVHD treated with prednisone at the time of EGD (six of seven). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic BMT recipients receiving prednisone for immunoprophylaxis after grafting or for treatment of acute GVHD are at high risk for clinically relevant bacteremia following EGD. Such patients are candidates for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to endoscopy.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the University of Washington Medical Center, 37 patients with Hickman catheters and S. aureus bacteremia were studied by retrospective chart review. Clinical features associated with each episode of infection were determined, and the relationships among clinical features, therapy, and outcomes were explored. RESULTS: Only 18% of all Hickman catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremias and only 10% of those cases with exit site infections were cured without catheter removal. In seven of 41 episodes (17%), death or bacteremic relapse occurred. The best prognosis was found in infections with a low blood culture colony count (less than 1 colony/mL). CONCLUSION: Hickman catheter-associated bacteremia due to S. aureus has a worse prognosis than other Hickman catheter-associated bacteremias. Early catheter removal should be considered except in cases with a remote, noncatheter focus of infection or in infections with no catheter-related physical signs and blood culture colony counts of less than 1/mL.\r"

We had observed an apparent correlation between the severity of immunodeficiency and the site of mucosal candida infection. The current study was designed to determine whether significant correlations existed between the sites of mucosal candida infection and the degree of immunodeficiency, as determined by subsets of lymphocyte populations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects in this study are 66 HIV-seropositive women evaluated by members of the Brown University Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Program during the 3-year period, September 1, 1986, through August 30, 1989. All patients had thorough clinical evaluations and relevant laboratory studies at defined intervals. All patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 0.2 X 10(9)/L received zidovudine therapy as soon as it became available. After July 1988, all patients with CD4 counts below 0.2 X 10(9)/L received prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. All patients were counseled about HIV infection, its modes of transmission, and the early symptoms of opportunistic infections. RESULTS: The longitudinal data demonstrated that candida often infected vaginal mucosa when there was no significant reduction in CD4 lymphocyte counts. Candida infection of the oropharyngeal mucosa was associated with highly significant reductions in CD4 lymphocyte counts. Esophageal candidiasis occurred only with advanced immunodeficiency associated with CD4 counts below 0.1 X 10(9)/L. CONCLUSIONS: Candida mucosal infections occur in a hierarchical pattern in women with HIV infection. Determination of the basis for the differences in susceptibility to candida of the vaginal, oropharyngeal, and esophageal mucosal surfaces will require further studies.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The program consisted of: (1) a hospital policy allowing nurses to vaccinate without a signed physician's order; (2) stamped reminders on all clinic progress notes; (3) a 2-week walk-in flu shot clinic; (4) influenza vaccination \"stations\" in the busiest clinic areas; and (5) a mailing to all outpatients. Risk characteristics and vaccination rates for patients were estimated from a validated self-administered postcard questionnaire mailed to 500 randomly selected outpatients. For comparison, 500 patients were surveyed from each of three other Midwestern VAMCs without similar programs. RESULTS: Overall, 70.6% of Minneapolis patients were high-risk and 58.3% of them were vaccinated. In contrast, 69.9% of patients at the comparison medical centers were high-risk, but only 29.9% of them were vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The Minneapolis VAMC influenza vaccination program was highly successful and may serve as a useful model for achieving the national health objective for influenza immunization.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 55 patients with SLE currently being treated with dialysis were reviewed. Disease activity was measured according to the SLE Disease Activity Index, event rates per 1,000 months' patient observation, and use of medication. RESULTS: In the majority of patients, deterioration of renal function was slowly progressive over more than 2 years. After the initiation of dialysis for end-stage renal failure, maximal extrarenal disease activity and use of medication decreased markedly, but event rates for specific nonrenal manifestations of lupus did not decrease. Overall survival with dialysis was 89% after 5 years. During dialysis no difference was found in disease activity and use of medication between treatment with either hemodialysis of CAPD. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of anti-double-stranded DNA, however, occurred more frequently during CAPD. CONCLUSION: Patients with SLE have excellent survival rates with dialysis; their disease activity is diminished during dialysis but not abolished. No difference in survival or disease activity was found between patients undergoing hemodialysis or CAPD.\r"

As a result, a new formulation of intranasal human calcitonin (hCT) was developed, and the efficacy investigated in patients treated earlier with sCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with Paget's disease were treated twice daily for 6 months with 1 mg synthetic hCT administered intranasally. Five patients demonstrated low-titer antibodies to sCT, and four of the patients did not respond previously to 1-year therapy with intranasal sCT. The hypocalcemic effect of 3 mg hCT was compared to that of 0.1 mg sCT before and after the intranasal hCT therapy. Serum alkaline phosphatase and the ratio between the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and creatinine were measured before and during intranasal hCT treatment. RESULTS: The hypocalcemic response to 3 mg intranasal hCT (-6.60 +/- 0.67%, mean +/- standard error) was similar before and at the end of intranasal hCT therapy (-5.92 +/- 0.80%, p greater than 0.1). Intranasal sCT (0.1 mg) lowered serum calcium less effectively (-2.86 +/- 0.76%) than 3 mg intranasal hCT (p less than 0.05). The presence of low-titer antibodies to sCT did not affect the hypocalcemic response to sCT or hCT. As a result of the 6-month intranasal hCT regimen, serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio were reduced to 62 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001) and 80 +/- 7% (p less than 0.05) respectively, of pretreatment levels. In four patients previously resistant to intranasal sCT therapy because of neutralizing antibodies to sCT, serum alkaline phosphatase was similarly lowered by intranasal hCT to 66 +/- 6% of pretreatment levels (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: A new formulation of intranasal hCT effectively lowered serum calcium levels, alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and urinary hydroxyproline excretion in patients with Paget's disease, some of whom were previously resistant to intranasal sCT because of neutralizing antibodies.\r"

Examples of external factors include physician legal liability and family wishes about patient care. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A nationwide sample consisted of 300 randomly selected physician-members from the American Society of Law and Medicine (ASLM) and 300 from the Society for Critical Care Medicine (SCCM); 179 ASLM physicians (60%) and 165 SCCM physicians (55%) responded. A mailed questionnaire presented three cases, each requiring the physician to make a life-support decision. For each case, the physician chose one of several life-support options and rated the importance to his or her decision of specific \"decision factors,\" including some external factors. We assumed the physician would choose the management option supported by the decision factors that the physician considered most important. For this reason, we used discriminant analysis to identify the factors whose importance ratings best predicted management choices. RESULTS: In the first case, 46% of ASLM respondents and 55% of SCCM respondents chose to stop the ventilator of a chronically comatose patient with unknown preferences about life support. Thirty-one percent of ASLM and 27% of SCCM respondents chose to continue the ventilator, and 21% of ASLM and 14% of SCCM respondents chose to apply for a judicial decision. Importance ratings for the external factor, physician legal liability, best predicted management choices. In the second case, 95% of ASLM and 94% of SCCM respondents chose to resuscitate a cancer patient at the patient's request; 3% of ASLM and 4% of SCCM respondents chose no resuscitation. Importance ratings for patient preferences best predicted management choices. In the third case, 38% of ASLM and 35% of SCCM respondents honored a stroke patient's previous refusal of tube feedings, but 59% of ASLM and 62% of SCCM respondents authorized tube feedings in order to secure nursing home placement. Importance ratings for patient preferences best predicted management choices in this case. External factors impacted management choices considerably in the first case and more modestly in the second and third cases. CONCLUSION: External factors impact the life-support decisions of physicians. Physician legal liability may have an especially great impact on these decisions when patients' preferences are not known.\r"

Almost two-thirds had chronic conditions requiring medical intervention. The top five conditions in terms of prevalence were neurologic, ophthalmologic, dermatologic, psychiatric-emotional, and orthopedic. The majority of conditions were being managed appropriately in the community health system. A substantial proportion can be managed by primary care physicians with limited specialty involvement. For almost 60 percent of clients with conditions requiring home treatments on an ongoing basis, however, service gaps were identified. Other problems included the reluctance of some providers to accept Medicaid, and the inability of some clients to cooperate with medical examinations.\r"

Both homeless and housed poor mothers averaged 29 years old and were accompanied by two or three children. Three-fourths of both the homeless and housed families had income below the poverty level, and both groups expended almost two-thirds of their income on housing. Mothers in homeless families more commonly reported spousal abuse (35 vs 16 percent), child abuse (28 vs 10 percent), drug use (43 vs. 30 percent), or mental health problems (14 vs 6 percent) and weaker support networks. Homeless mothers more commonly came from homes where their parents abused drugs or alcohol (49 vs 34 percent) or more commonly lived outside the home or in foster care (35 vs 25 percent). Homelessness was reported as due primarily to economic pressures of housing costs, but personal and family problems frequently played a contributing role, especially for single parent families. Burdens of increasing housing costs and family dysfunction among housed poor families place many at risk for homelessness.\r"

Ninety-five percent of the reported smokers had serum cotinine levels indicative of smoking (greater than 13 ng/ml). The median cotinine level was higher in Black than White smokers (221 ng/ml versus 170 ng/ml; 95 percent CI for difference: 34, 65) in spite of the fact that estimated daily nicotine exposure and serum thiocyanate were higher in Whites. The difference persisted after controlling for number of cigarettes, nicotine content, frequency of inhalation, weekly sidestream smoke exposure, age, gender, and education. A reporting bias and nicotine intake were ruled out as explanations for the racial difference suggesting that the metabolism of nicotine or the excretion of cotinine may differ by race. Racial differences in cotinine levels may provide clues to the reasons for the observed lower cessation rates and higher rates of some smoking-related cancers in Blacks.\r"

We defined underreporting of cigarette use as a cotinine to cigarette-per-day ratio of greater than 0.142 microM/l which represented a substantial discrepancy between self-reported consumption and serum cotinine. Of the 98 men and 97 women who reported smoking one to nine cigarettes/day, 20.4 percent and 24.7 percent, respectively, underreported their cigarette consumption. Underreporting was less common among men and women smoking 10 to 19 cigarettes/day (8.3 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively) and 20 or more cigarettes/day (2.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively). Comparison of underreporters to other smokers by demographic characteristics within sex and cigarettes/day categories showed no differences. Differences in cotinine metabolism and extremely efficient smoking are alternative explanations that can not be ruled out with these data. We believe, however, that a proportion of Mexican American light smokers may underreport the quantity of cigarettes smoked per day, and may truly be moderate or heavy smokers.\r"

Risky sexual practices were in general reported more frequently by men at the jail than men at other sites. However, HIV status showed little relation to enrollment site. These results have implications both for targeting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention programs to needle users not in drug abuse treatment and for potential selection bias in studies of intravenous drug users.\r"

Five hundred and forty-one drownings (2.1 per 100,000 person-years) were identified from death certificates and from incident reports filed with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Most drownings (334, 62 percent) occurred during summer months (May-August) and involved boating (42 percent) and swimming (35 percent) events. However, 62 drownings (11 percent) occurred during winter months (December-February) and primarily involved snowmobiles and motor vehicles (71 percent) breaking through ice on lakes and waterways. The risk of drowning, estimated by the ratio of drownings to number of water-related activities, was highest during March and April, when the ice on lakes and waterway surfaces is melting, and during October and November, when lake and waterway surfaces are starting to freeze. Drowning rates were highest for males (3.7 per 100,000 person-years), persons 15 to 25 years of age (3.3 per 100,000 person-years), and children less than 5 years of age (2.5 per 100,000 person-years).

However, there was no apparent single source of exposure from a restaurant, or community gathering; nor was there a geographic clustering by residence. Cases were mainly adults 20-59 years old (89 percent); 51 percent were female. A case-control study using neighborhood controls found that factors associated with hepatitis A were: having eaten downtown (odds ratio [OR] = 4.0) and having dined at any one of three restaurants (OR = 21.0). Case-control studies of patrons of two of these restaurants found that eating green salad was strongly associated with acquiring hepatitis A: OR = 11.6 and OR = 4.4. The three implicated restaurants accounted for 71 percent of the cases. All three restaurants were supplied by the same fresh produce distributor; however, investigation suggested that contamination most likely occurred prior to local distribution. This outbreak of hepatitis A is the first in the United States apparently associated with fresh produce contaminated before distribution to restaurants, and raises important public health issues regarding the regulation of fresh produce.\r"

To assess the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections on this trend and to identify causes that are increasing in association with the HIV epidemic, we analyzed national mortality statistics and compared death rates in states with high and low incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In 1987, there were 10,248 deaths with HIV infection, AIDS, or conditions in the AIDS surveillance definition assigned as the underlying cause, representing 11 percent of deaths for men in this age group compared to less than 1 percent in 1980. In addition, deaths with other underlying causes, such as other infections, drug abuse, and unknown/unspecified causes, had diverging and higher rates in states with high versus low AIDS incidence. In the absence of deaths due to HIV/AIDS and excess deaths due to these associated conditions, we estimate that death rates for men 25-44 years of age would have been 201-209/100,000 in 1987. For 1987, approximately 70-90 percent of HIV-related deaths were reported through national AIDS surveillance. The HIV epidemic has led to a reversal in mortality trends and to increases in various causes of death for young men.\r"

The seroprevalences were 0.0-0.4 percent in women and 0.0-1.1 percent in men. We also examined the impact of mandatory premarital HIV screening on marriage rates in Louisiana and Illinois. In 1988, after screening began, 9 percent and 16 percent fewer marriage licenses than in the previous two years were issued in Louisiana and Illinois, respectively. We estimated that mandatory premarital screening, if adopted nationally, would cost $167,230,000. We conclude that compared with other HIV prevention programs mandatory premarital screening would be expensive and would probably have a minor impact on the HIV epidemic.\r"

In June 1985 a population-based serosurvey for viral hepatitis involving 120 households was conducted at the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Sioux Indian reservations in South Dakota. The serosurvey was performed shortly after a large hepatitis A epidemic on the Pine Ridge reservation in 1983-84, and immediately before a large hepatitis A epidemic on the Rosebud reservation in 1985-86. The overall seroprevalence for antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) was 76.2 percent (Pine Ridge reservation 80.5 percent, Rosebud reservation 72.0 percent, relative risk = 1.12, 95 percent confidence interval = 1.01, 1.24). For age groups 0 to 4 years, 54.2 percent and 36.1 percent of children were seropositive at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, respectively. Seropositivity rose rapidly with age; by age 40, more than 90 percent of persons at both Pine Ridge and Rosebud were anti-HAV positive. Only 1.1 percent of persons tested were positive for hepatitis B markers. Anti-HAV seroprevalence rates in both communities are similar to rates observed in developing countries. The surprisingly high anti-HAV seroprevalence among young children at Rosebud, where clinical hepatitis A had been virtually absent in the previous seven years, indicates that high-grade silent transmission was taking place during the interepidemic period.\r"

  ".U": "90342915\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate whether the process of graduate medical education increases costs in teaching hospitals by causing longer lengths of stay and greater resource use, we compared lengths of stay, hospital charges, and the use of cardiovascular procedures for patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to the teaching and nonteaching services of a university-affiliated community hospital. After adjusting for severity of illness and demographic characteristics, patients on the teaching services had a mean length of stay that was shorter by 0.6 days (p = 0.04) and mean charges that were $2,060 lower (p = 0.15) than for patients on the nonteaching service. Patients on the teaching service also had 15 percent (95% CI: -26, -4) fewer cardiac catheterizations and 9 percent (-18, 0) fewer procedures for myocardial revascularization (angioplasty or cardiac bypass surgery). These findings suggest that graduate medical education per se may not directly increase the use of health care resources and that the cost differences between teaching and nonteaching hospitals may be largely a consequence of other factors. These factors may include epiphenomena of teaching such as a specialized organizational structure, specialized patient care services, and continuing medical education for the nursing and medical staffs. They may also include factors not related to teaching such as differences in patients' severity of illness and sociodemographic characteristics.\r"

A pretest-posttest control group design was used to study 41 intervention sites and 19 control sites with 29,315 and 14,573 hourly employees, respectively. Blue-collar employees at intervention sites experienced an 14.0 percent decline in disability days over two years versus a 5.8 percent decline at control sites. This resulted in a net difference of 11,726 fewer disability days over two years at program sites compared with non-program sites. Savings due to lower disability costs at intervention sites offset program costs in the first year, and provided a return of $2.05 for every dollar invested in the program by the end of the second year. These results suggest that comprehensive workplace health promotion programs can reduce disability days among blue collar employees and provide a good return on investment.\r"

A secondary objective was to determine whether daily total fluid consumption itself is related to premenstrual syndrome. The study is based on 841 responses to a questionnaire probing menstrual and premenstrual health, and daily fluid consumption, which was mailed to female university students in Oregon. Analysis of the data revealed that consumption of caffeine-containing beverages was strongly related to the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome. Among women with more severe symptoms, the relation between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and premenstrual syndrome was dose-dependent, with prevalence odds ratios equal to 1.3 for consumers of one cup of a caffeine-containing beverage per day and increasing steadily to 7.0 for consumers of eight to 10 cups per day. The effects were apparent among both caffeine-containing tea/coffee consumers and caffeine-containing soda consumers. The observed effects were only slightly reduced when daily total fluid consumption was controlled. Daily total fluid consumption also was related to the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms although the effects were large only for consumers of 13-19 cups of fluid per day (the largest amount studied).\r"

Flies fed on a leishmanial lesion on the nose of a hamster were examined for infection at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hr and at approximately 24 hr intervals from day 3 to day 14 post-feeding. Infection rates, determined by light microscopy, were 47% (n = 258) in P. duboscqi and 5% (n = 162) in S. schwetzi. Transformation from amastigotes to \"procyclic\" promastigotes occurred in both species at 6-18 hr post-feeding. In P. duboscqi, the parasites multiplied rapidly and developed through as many as 10 forms, including at least 3 dividing-promastigote forms. Metacyclic promastigotes, the \"infective\" form, appeared at 6 days post-feeding, first in the region of the stomodeal valve, then in the pharynx, cibarium, and proboscis. In a single attempt 14 days post-feeding, a P. duboscqi transmitted L. major to a mouse by bite. In contrast, the parasites multiplied slowly in S. schwetzi, and did not develop beyond \"procyclic\" promastigotes. The parasites did not migrate anteriorly nor survive beyond 90 hr post-feeding, indicating that S. schwetzi is not a vector of L. major. Classical strategies for vector incrimination may be confounded by the isolation of non-infective early developmental forms of Leishmania from wild-caught non-vectors.\r"

Immunized, but not control mice, develop peripheral blood and pulmonary eosinophilia (2,000 cells/mm3 and 65,000 cells/bronchoalveolar lavage, respectively). Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage filarial-specific IgG antibodies are greater in sensitized mice than in controls (ELISA absorbance values 20- and 10-fold higher, respectively). Serum IgE antibody levels are also greater (P less than 0.01) in immunized parasite-challenged mice than in controls (mean cpm 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgE bound to B. malayi antigen-coated Sepharose beads: 7,852 vs. 1,741, respectively). This model exhibits several of the major features of human TPE: amicrofilaremia, elevated levels of serum IgG and IgE antibodies to microfilariae, and blood and pulmonary eosinophilia. This model may be useful in the examination of the role of filarial antigen-specific lymphoid cells and antibodies in regulating the pathologic responses to microfilariae trapped in the lung.\r"

However, these sequences did not define the primary structures of the mRNA and protein. The complete sequence of the 1390 base mRNA has now been determined. It encodes a 50 kDa primary translation product. In vitro translations coupled with immunoprecipitations and Western blots of parasite lysates allowed visualization of the 50 kDa form. Production of the 31 kDa mature hemoglobinase from the 50 kDa species involves removal of both NH2 and COOH terminal residues from the primary translation product. Expression of hemoglobinase mRNA and protein was examined during larval parasite development. Low levels were observed in young schistosomula. After 6-9 days in culture, high hemoglobinase levels were seen which correlated with the onset of red blood cell feeding. Immunoelectron microscopy was employed to examine hemoglobinase location and function. In adult worms the enzyme was associated with the gut lumen and gut epithelium. In cercariae, the protease was observed in the head gland, suggesting new roles for the protease.\r"

At 30 days, tissues were cultured for spirochetes and examined histologically. All species developed multisystemic infection as well as arthritis and carditis, but disease was most severe in rats and mice. In order to evaluate the effect of in vitro passage on the pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi, 3-day-old Lewis rats were inoculated ip with borreliae passaged in culture 2, 5, 11, 17, 21, 26, and 31 times, and evaluated at 30 days by culture, histology, and ELISA antibody titers. Based upon these parameters, B. burgdorferi (N40) lost its virulence at 17-21 passages. This study demonstrated that B. burgdorferi was infectious for infant rats, mice, hamsters, and 3-week-old rabbits, although pathogenicity was modulated by host species and the in vitro passage history of the spirochete. Of the 4 laboratory animal species evaluated in this study, rats and mice appear to have the most potential for further use as animal models of Lyme disease.\r"

Thogoto virus has been isolated from naturally infected R. appendiculatus and A. variegatum in Central Africa, where both commonly parasitize the same hosts. No significant difference was found between the infection thresholds of Thogoto virus in the 2 species. The percentage of nymphs of both species infected by feeding on viremic hamsters was directly correlated with the time between host inoculation and tick engorgement. The blood titers in infected hamsters increased each day during the 3-4 day viremia until the hamsters died. The percentage of nymphs infected correlated with the viremic titer on the final day of engorgement (the time of maximum blood uptake). The 5% infection threshold for nymphs of R. appendiculatus and A. variegatum was estimated as 10(2.8) and 10(2.7) plaque forming units (PFU)/ml viremia, respectively. The prevalence of infection approached 100% for blood titers greater than 10(6.3) PFU/ml and greater than 10(7) PFU/ml, respectively. The apparent bloodmeal size of the 2 species differed by 8-fold and suggested that, in terms of the number of PFU ingested, R. appendiculatus was more susceptible than A. variegatum to per os infection by Thogoto virus.\r"

  ".U": "90342949\r", 
  ".W": "The development of atherosclerotic lesions involves many cell types, including macrophages. Fibrinopeptide B (FPB) has been shown to be a potent chemotactic agent for macrophages, which are abundant as intimal foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions, especially in cholesterol-fed rabbits. We hypothesize that intimal low-density lipoproteins also cause fibrinogen in the intima to release FPB and that FPB attracts macrophages in response to the high lipid levels associated with lesion development. To test our hypothesis, we used an atherosclerotic model. Silk sutures containing either FPB, fibrinopeptide A (FPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or saline control were prepared. One suture of each type was placed in the adventitia of the femoral artery of a rabbit. Animals were killed at 1 or 2 weeks. Only vessels exposed to either FPB or LPS showed significant intimal thickening in the region adjacent to the suture site. Semi-thin electron microscopic sections indicated that the intimal wall was highly cellular and that many cells contained lipid vacuoles after 2 weeks. These sections also showed that the endothelium remained intact and that no injury to the media of the artery had occurred. Electron microscopy of the tissue samples showed the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and deposition of extracellular matrix in the 2-week animals, whereas foam cells were present in the 1-week animals. We conclude that FPB does indeed attract macrophages to the intima and that these macrophages may become foam cells. The model we have developed can be used to study possible mechanisms for the entry of macrophages into the intima during early lesion development and to further understand the complex interactions of FPB, fibrinogen, and lipids in atherosclerotic lesion development.\r"

All procedures were performed in the operating room using a neodynium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser source, and patients were evaluated for immediate and long-term hemodynamic and clinical improvement. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 82% of cases, with 57% of all patients (32 of 56) obtaining early hemodynamic and clinical improvement. Long-term clinical success (by life-table analysis) was obtained by only 22.5% at 6 months, and only 13.5% at 12 months. Patients presenting with intermittent claudication did significantly better than those presenting for limb salvage (p = 0.01), and trends toward improved outcome were noted for short versus long lesions as well as for patients with \"good\" versus \"poor\" distal runoff (NS). Procedure-related morbidity occurred in 14%, and there was one peri-procedural mortality (1.8%). We conclude that the use of LABA is associated with long-term clinical success in only a small proportion of patients, and that widespread clinical application of this technique is not indicated at the present time.\r"

Therefore, it is imperative to achieve wound closure as expeditiously as possible. Herein, we describe 11 patients with complicated groin wounds and report our management using sartorius myoplasty. Five of these patients had underlying prosthetic grafts at risk. All patients underwent wound closure with sartorius myoplasty after adequate debridement of necrotic and infected soft tissue. Success of wound closure with complete primary healing was observed in nine patients, while in two, adequate early coverage of femoral vessels was achieved, but extended wound care for superficial skin separation was necessary with eventual complete healing. There was no morbidity or mortality related to the added surgical procedure. One patient underwent late repair of a femoral false aneurysm. There were no other complications seen after an average follow-up of 20 months (range: 6 to 49 months). In summary, we recommend that sartorius myoplasty be considered for wound infections to hasten groin closure, decrease hospital stay, and reduce the chance of infectious complications.\r"

For a patient to have HHC, the patient had to have a defined wound, educational needs, or both. Sixty patients, 30 with HHC and 30 without, were contacted approximately 30 days after their last hospital discharge. The 30 patients with HHC were deemed to be at increased risk because of multisystem disease with multiple medications, infirmity, early senility, and often complex wounds. In a prospective fashion, each patient was interviewed by either a registered nurse or medical student using a standardized data collection form. The following issues were assessed: incidence of postoperative complications, knowledge of the patient of his or her disease, compliance with medication (knowledge of, regular use), incidence of readmission, and unscheduled clinic or emergency department visits. Upon statistical analysis using the two-sample t-test and Pearson chi-square test, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of complications, compliance, or patient education. HHC, therefore, was found to be helpful to patients with peripheral vascular disease. In our study, the use of HHC made the risk of complications in a group of patients with defined teaching needs and wound care needs equal to that in a group with no such defined needs on discharge from the hospital.\r"

  ".U": "90342955\r", 
  ".W": "Detection of failing arterial reconstructions requires intensive surveillance by frequent physical examination and noninvasive laboratory testing. However, many grafts fail during the intervals between these examinations. For this reason, we have developed an implantable miniaturized piezoelectric flow detection device whose function can be monitored externally by radiotransmission across the skin. Sensors were constructed from ultrathin polyvinylidene fluoride (PVF2) with piezoelectric activity and attached with silicone fixative to 6-mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Ten of these grafts were placed in mongrel dogs as iliofemoral bypasses. Real time data were acquired from the sensors at a rate of 200 Hz, using a DATAQ A/D data acquisition board and CODAS data acquisition software, while simultaneous blood flow (using an electromagnetic flowmeter) and intraluminal pressure were processed by using separate channels of the same data acquisition board. The data were stored on computer storage media and analyzed by the ASYST software, which allows simultaneous signal curves to be compared using regression analysis. In the resting state, the mean blood flow was 123 +/- 16 mL and the mean intraluminal pressure was 124/78 mm Hg, and there was perfect correlation between the PVF2 sensor and the flowmeter and between the sensor and the intraluminal pressure (correlation coefficient, r greater than or equal to 0.99 and r greater than or equal to 0.93, respectively). A tourniquet was applied to the iliac artery proximal to the graft to reduce the flow to approximately half of the resting state (mean flow after tourniquet: 66 +/- 6 mL/minute). Signal tracings from the three sources showed a remarkable similarity with a very high correlation coefficient (r greater than or equal to 0.99 between sensor and flowmeter and r greater than or equal to 0.92 between sensor and the pressure signal). These preliminary results show that the sensors made from low-profile and low-mass PVF2 material have the potential of being implanted around grafts for long-term, continuous monitoring of graft function. Further studies involving long-term implantation to assess the effect of tissue ingrowth and loss of compliance are necessary before this device can be used clinically.\r"

  ".W": "Recent developments in vascular surgery suggest that the retroperitoneal approach to the aorta and the use of epidural anesthesia for lower limb revascularization are associated with decreased morbidity and shorter hospital stays. By combining these principles, we sought to determine if retroperitoneal aortic surgery could be performed under epidural anesthesia and if this might be advantageous. Over a 16-month period, 57 patients underwent aortic surgery via the retroperitoneal (n = 33) or transperitoneal (n = 24) approach. In the former, epidural anesthesia was employed in 10 patients, general anesthesia in 3, and combined epidural anesthesia and general anesthesia in the remaining 20. In the transperitoneal group, general anesthesia was employed in 21 patients and combined epidural anesthesia and general anesthesia in 3. Both groups were similar in age and gender, but risk factors were predominant in the retroperitoneal group. With the exception of one death due to aspiration, there were no significant differences between the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal groups with respect to overall morbidity, pulmonary complications, and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. Despite these findings, we favor the combination of epidural and general anesthesia for retroperitoneal aortic surgery. Morbidity was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) in low-risk retroperitoneal patients when combined epidural anesthesia and general anesthesia were employed.\r"

  ".W": "Perirenal aortic exposure and control can be facilitated by division of the left renal vein (LRV), but only if adequate collateral venous drainage is present. When incremental elevations in LRV pressure were produced in nine dogs, we noted that left renal glomerular and tubular function (creatinine clearance, sodium retention, urine osmolality, and urine output) were virtually lost at pressures greater than 50 to 60 cm water. Between January 1967 and December 1989, 64 patients underwent LRV division during the performance of abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery (57 of 589 = 10%) or reconstruction for aortoiliac occlusive disease (7 of 506 = 1%). LRV stump pressures (LRVSPs) were measured in 44 of these patients and were less than or equal to 60 cm water in all but one instance. Ten of the 64 patients died, but none as a consequence of this maneuver. Post-operatively, all survivors had serial serum creatinine levels measured and either an intravenous pyelogram, renal scan, or arteriogram. One case of a non-functioning left kidney was identified. This occurred in the only patient who underwent re-anastomosis after LRV division. A LRVSP equal to or greater than 50 cm water and extreme venous distention after test clamping served as a contraindication to LRV division in seven other patients. We conclude that a LRVSP less than or equal to 50 to 60 cm water indicates that the LRV may be safely divided during juxtarenal aortic exposure. However, a pressure greater than or equal to 50 to 60 cm water suggests that LRV division should not be carried out unless absolutely essential and then only if right kidney function is known to be adequate.\r"

Follow-up of patients with axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis at a mean of 2 years revealed that 49% of these patients had died.

In order to analyze the impact of newer diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, we retrospectively examined the last 45 consecutive cases of SVC syndrome treated over a 12-year period. The underlying causes were advanced lung cancer (57%), mediastinal tumors (20%), and metastatic solid malignancy (5%). Forty-two patients (93%) were treated with external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy with a mean patients survival of 3 months; 11 of 42 patients (26%) were treated without histologic diagnosis. Symptoms of SVC obstruction resolved in 80% of patients who underwent radiotherapy, with a mean interval of 4 weeks. The most common cause of death was respiratory arrest. Of the three patients with benign disease, two underwent caval reconstruction with greater than 3-year patency and relief of symptoms. We conclude that (1) SVC syndrome portends a grim prognosis when associated with malignancy but usually responds to radiation or chemotherapy; (2) CT scan is the best available method to document the extent and location of involvement; and (3) patients with benign disease should be evaluated for caval reconstruction, which may produce rewarding long-term results.\r"

Autologous platelet-rich plasma is transfused at the completion of the operation after heparin reversal. Our data show an approximate 50% reduction in homologous blood product requirement. Seventy-five percent of patients having aortic surgery received no homologous blood products during their hospital stay. For those undergoing cardiac surgery, there has been about a 45% reduction in the use of homologous blood products. In our experience, autologous platelet-rich plasma not only decreases the risk of transmittable disease, but promotes hemostasis.\r"

Initially, 147 of those with failed reconstruction attempts underwent below-knee (BK) amputation and 63 underwent above-knee (AK) amputation. One hundred ten of 143 (77%) surviving BK amputations eventually healed. This is in contrast to the eventual healing in 266 of 298 (89%) of the BK amputations performed with no prior attempts at reconstruction. A statistically significant (p less than 0.05) difference in eventual healing favoring those with no prior reconstruction was demonstrated. Successful reconstruction of the ischemic extremity is the goal of vascular surgery and should be attempted when indicated. However, it should be realized that unsuccessful revascularization attempts may adversely affect healing in those limbs initially considered for a BK amputation.\r"

Patients underwent diagnostic arteriography if one or more of the following abnormal clinical findings were present: distal pulse deficit, nerve deficit, soft-tissue loss, decreased capillary refill, bruit, or a history of hemorrhage or hypotension. In the absence of these findings, arteriography was performed for significant orthopedic injuries, i.e., knee dislocations or complex long-bone fractures. In 31 patients (58%), arteriography was performed because 1 or more abnormal clinical findings were present and 12 arterial injuries were identified, 4 requiring arterial repair. The presence of a knee dislocation or complex long-bone fracture was the only indication for arteriography in 22 patients (42%) and 3 arterial injuries were identified, none requiring operative intervention. For all patients, two variables, pulse deficit and delayed capillary refill, strongly correlated (p less than 0.05) with arteriographic demonstration of an arterial injury. In the absence of these findings, routine diagnostic arteriography will have a low diagnostic yield and will rarely identify a vascular injury in a major artery that will require operative repair. Arteriography should be selectively performed and guided by examination and noninvasive Doppler indices.\r"

In 64% and 25% of patients with nerve or musculoskeletal injury, respectively, the arm was functionally impaired. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention eliminate vascular injury as a factor in upper-extremity limb loss or disability. Functional deficits are the result of nerve or orthopedic injuries.\r"

The patients were allocated to receive either chlorazepate dipotassium 25 mg alone or omeprazole 40 mg and chlorazepate dipotassium 25 mg on the night before surgery. Gastric volume and pH were measured after induction of anaesthesia. Patients who received omeprazole had a higher mean pH than control patients (p less than 0.001). The pH was less than 3.5 in 50% of patients in the control group, but in only 4.5% of those who received omeprazole (p less than 0.01). Mean (SEM) volume of gastric fluid was 15.2 (2.7) ml in the control group and 9.2 (1.8) ml in the omeprazole group, but the results were not statistically significant. A single dose of 40 mg omeprazole significantly decreased the number of patients at risk of aspiration pneumonitis.\r"

Seven patients had placebo, six received fentanyl 100 micrograms and seven were given fentanyl 300 micrograms. A significant improvement in postoperative pain, as assessed by linear visual analogue scale, was achieved in the higher dose group, and in both fentanyl groups the time to alternative analgesia was significantly longer than in the control group. Serum fentanyl levels after inhalation of 100 micrograms reached a plateau around 0.04 ng/ml and after 300 micrograms at around 0.1 ng/ml after 15 minutes. Inhaled fentanyl may have a useful analgesic effect despite these low serum levels; this supports the hypothesis that the mode of analgesia from inhaled opioids may be different from that after other routes of administration. There were no adverse effects such as respiratory depression, bronchospasm, nausea or drowsiness.\r"

Of 1,541 claims reviewed, 227 (15%) were for anesthesia-related nerve injury. Ulnar neuropathy represented one-third of all nerve injuries and was the most frequent nerve injury. Less-frequent sites of nerve injury were the brachial plexus (23%) and the lumbosacral nerve roots (16%). In a large proportion of cases, the exact mechanism of injury was unclear despite evidence of intensive investigation in the claim files. Median payment for nerve damage claims involving disabling injury was $56,000, which was significantly lower than the $225,000 median payment for claims for disabling injury not involving nerve damage (P less than 0.01). The closed claims reviewers judged that the standard of care had been met significantly more often in claims involving nerve damage than in claims not involving nerve damage. The authors conclude that nerve damage is a significant source of anesthesia-related claims but that the exact mechanism of nerve injury is often unclear. In particular, ulnar nerve injuries seemed to occur without identifiable mechanism.\r"

After an initial dose of 1-3 mg/kg, propofol was administered iv at 3 mg/kg/h for 72 h. Arterial blood samples were collected at selected times during and up to 72 h after infusion. Propofol whole blood concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis. Derived pharmacokinetic parameters showed a long terminal phase (T1/2 = 1878 +/- 672 min), a large volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss = 1666 +/- 756 l), and a high total body clearance (Cl = 1.57 +/- 0.56 l/min). While the propofol terminal elimination half-life is longer than that previously reported, emergence from sedation after prolonged administration will be governed by both redistribution mechanisms arising from the large distribution volumes and elimination from the body.\r"

Overall thermal comfort was evaluated at 5-10 min intervals using a 10-cm visual analog scale. The warming devices were: 1) a pair of 250-W infrared heating lamps mounted 71 cm above the abdomen; 2) the Thermal Ceiling MTC XI UL (500 W) set on \"high\" and mounted 56 cm above the volunteer; 3) a 54-by-145-cm circulating-water blanket set to 40 degrees C placed over the volunteer; and 4) the Bair Hugger forced air warmer with an adult-sized cover set on \"low\" (approximately 33 degrees C), \"medium\" (approximately 38 degrees C), and \"high\" (approximately 43 degrees C). Following a 10-min control period, each device was placed over the volunteer and activated for a 30-min period. All devices were started \"cold\" and warmed up during the study period. The Bair Hugger set on \"medium\" decreased heat loss more than each radiant warming device and as much as the circulating-water blanket. All methods reached maximum efficacy within 20 min. Set on \"high,\" the Bair Hugger increased skin-surface temperature more than the circulating-water blanket. The Bair Hugger (all settings) and the water blanket raised skin temperature more than the radiant heaters. The circulating-water blanket was the most effective device for heating an optimally placed transducer on the chest (directly under and parallel to the radiant heat sources, and touching the water and Bair Hugger blankets).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In agreement with an earlier similar study in volunteers given only methohexital and aiming at the same set point, identical distribution of EEG power was achieved in the current study. The decrease of median EEG frequency to 2-3 Hz was primarily induced by an increase in fractional power in the 0.5-2- Hz frequency band to 46 +/- 4%. The average requirement of methohexital during the first 2 h was 675 +/- 250 mg. The authors conclude that model-based feedback control of intravenous methohexital delivery can help establish and quantitate methohexital requirements during total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of dexmedetomidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on vigilance, thiopental anesthetic requirements, and the hemodynamic, catecholamine, and hormonal responses to surgery were investigated in healthy (ASA physical status 1) women scheduled for dilatation and curettage (D & C) of the uterus. Fifteen minutes before induction they received single iv doses of either dexmedetomidine (0.5 micrograms/kg; n = 19) or saline (n = 20) in a double-blind fashion. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with N2O/O2 (70/30%) and thiopental. Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and no serious drug-related subjective side-effects or adverse events were observed. The most prominent subjective effects were fatigue and decreased salivation. The total amount of thiopental needed to perform D & C of the uterus was reduced approximately 30% (from 456 +/- 141 mg [mean +/- SD] after saline to 316 +/- 79 mg after dexmedetomidine). This was mostly due to a smaller induction dose in the group receiving dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine appeared to improve the recovery from anesthesia as measured by visual analogue scales (VAS) on fatigue and nausea. The plasma concentration of norepinephrine was decreased by 56% after dexmedetomidine implying decreased sympathetic nervous activity. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were moderately reduced after dexmedetomidine administration. The authors conclude that dexmedetomidine preanesthetic medication decreases thiopental anesthetic requirements and improves the recuperation from anesthesia with no serious hemodynamic or other adverse effects. Further studies in patients undergoing more stressful surgery are indicated.\r"

Blinded intubators graded intubating conditions 60 s after the induction of anesthesia with thiopental. Intubation scores in the succinylcholine group were significantly better than in the priming group (P = 0.009). Intubation scores of the succinylcholine and the timing groups were not significantly different. Use of the timing principle for rapid-sequence orotracheal intubation is a reliable alternative in cases where succinylcholine is contraindicated.\r"

Cortical and subcortical blood flow and CMRO2 were measured in awake, unrestrained rats while awake and during 70% N2O administration using radioactive microspheres. In the awake state, cortical and subcortical blood flow were 126 +/- 10 and 98 +/- 7 ml.100 g-1.min-1, respectively, and CMRO2 (cortical) was 10.0 +/- 0.6 ml O2.100 g-1.min-1 (mean +/- SE). After 15 min of 70% N2O, cortical and subcortical blood flow increased 100% and 40%, respectively, while CMRO2 did not increase significantly. Cerebral blood flow remained increased after 60 min of N2O exposure, and CMRO2 did not change. These results show that N2O produces cerebrovasodilation in rats that is not related to a change in metabolic demand. Plasma catecholamines do not change during N2O administration, indicating that the increase in blood flow is not due to a general stress response.\r"

  ".U": "90343079\r", 
  ".W": "Development of an index of myocardial contractility that is both load independent and easily quantified in vivo has been a difficult task. Recently, three measures of contractile state have been advocated that appear to fulfill these requirements: the end-systolic pressure-length relationship (ESPLR), the ESPLR area, and regional preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW). Because the effects of halothane and isoflurane on these indices of contractility have yet to be studied, the purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of these volatile anesthetics on contractile function as evaluated via these techniques in chronically instrumented dogs. Because autonomic nervous system tone substantially influences systemic hemodynamics in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Four groups comprised the 36 experiments that were performed with nine dogs. Following inhalational induction, the dogs were maintained on 1.5 MAC and 2 MAC of halothane or isoflurane. Pressure-length loops were generated after 1 h of equilibration using preload reduction via partial inferior vena caval occlusion or afterload augmentation by a phenylephrine infusion. The PRSW and ESPLR were then calculated, respectively. Slope and length intercept variables obtained from the ESPLR failed to significantly change from control with increasing levels of anesthetic depth despite substantial decreases in other indices of contractility. However, combination of slope and length intercept parameters into the ESPLR area model proved to be a sensitive and easily calculable measure of depressed myocardial function. Similarly, regional PRSW slope precisely reflected changes in contractile state when halothane (62 +/- 10 for control to 30 +/- 6 erg.cm-2.10(-3).mm-1 at 2 MAC) or isoflurane (83 +/- 14 for control to 55 +/- 8 erg.cm-2.10(-3).mm-1 at 2 MAC) were administered. The PRSW slope also demonstrated a significant difference in depressed contractility when equianesthetic concentrations of halothane and isoflurane were compared (63 +/- 7% of control with halothane versus 86 +/- 4% of control with isoflurane at 1.5 MAC; 50 +/- 5% of control with halothane versus 70 +/- 6% of control with isoflurane at 2 MAC). The ESPLR area also accurately demonstrated the differential depression in contractile function suggested by recent in vitro studies when equianesthetic doses of halothane and isoflurane were compared in vivo. Therefore, while ESPLR slope and length intercept variables fail as indices of myocardial contractility, ESPLR area and regional PRSW slope were shown to be useful indicators of contractile state in the conscious and anesthetized dog.\r"

Bupivacaine was infused at a constant rate while the pigs' ECGs and EEGs were recorded. Six pigs in each age group were lightly anesthetized with 70% N2O/30% O2 during the bupivacaine infusion, and twelve 2-day-old pigs were anesthetized with 70% N2O/30% O2 plus either 0.5 X MAC halothane or isoflurane. Two-day-old pigs were more resistant than older pigs to the toxic effects of bupivacaine despite higher plasma concentrations at all sample times. All pigs given N2O alone or N2O plus halothane had ventricular dysrhythmias, but only one pig in the N2O plus isoflurane group had a ventricular dysrhythmia. Threshold doses of bupivacaine for dysrhythmias in the N2O alone and N2O plus halothane groups did not differ. Seizures occurred in all pigs in the N2O alone group, in none of the N2O plus halothane group, and in two of the N2O plus isoflurane group. The doses required to depress cardiac index and cause asystole were less in the groups receiving halothane and isoflurane. It was concluded that N2O plus halothane and N2O plus isoflurane increase the lethality of bupivacaine while preventing early warning signs of toxicity.\r"

Each serum was preincubated with buffer and 0.0014 to 1.4 mg/ml of the four protamine preparations before addition to an agarose-based solid-phase radioimmunoassay using 125I-radiolabeled staph protein A as the detection protein. In the seven sera, the concentration of soluble protamine inhibiting 50% of protamine antibody (IC50) was determined by interpolating from points above and below 50% inhibition for each protamine preparation. No significant difference was found in the IC50 among the four different protamine preparations (P greater than 0.25; Kruskal-Wallis). The authors concluded that there is no significant difference in the immunoreactivity of the four commercial protamine preparations with human antiprotamine IgG antibody. Thus, there appears to be no advantage in using a particular intravenous protamine preparation based on immunoreactivity with human antiprotamine antibody.\r"

  ".W": "The management of the young asthmatic child is still controversial and it has been questioned whether the infant and very young child with asthma respond to beta 2 agonists. We studied the response to nebulized beta 2 agonists in 43 children under the age of 2 years who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma. Clinical score and oxygen saturation were determined on admission to the emergency room and at least 30 minutes after each inhalation. The clinical score was defined as the sum of five variables (heart rate, respiratory rate, dyspnea, accessory muscle use, and wheezing), each graded as 0 or 1. The mean clinical score improved significantly after nebulized albuterol (mean +/- SD, 3.75 +/- 1.2 versus 2.80 +/- 1.65, P less than .01). Mean oxygen saturation did not change significantly (mean +/- SD, 94.8% +/- 2.85 versus 95.2% +/- 2.54). Only three patients had a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation of greater than 2% (3% in each one of them) following bronchodilator therapy. Our results suggest beta 2 inhalation to be beneficial to the majority of asthmatic children younger than 2 years of age and safe to administer. The combination of clinical score and oxygen saturation provides a simple noninvasive method of monitoring the response to therapy in young children with acute asthma.\r"

  ".U": "90343108\r", 
  ".W": "Eye washing with chamomile tea is a folk remedy used by the general public to treat conjunctivitis and other ocular reactions. Chamomile is also found in many cosmetic products. Some cases of contact dermatitis (but not reactions of type I) were reported following its topical applications. We present seven hay fever patients that suffered from conjunctivitis; two of them also had lid angioedema after eye washing with chamomile tea. All seven patients had positive skin prick tests to the chamomile tea extract, Matricaria chamomilla pollen and Artemisia vulgaris pollen extracts. Positive conjunctival provocations were also observed in all the patients with the chamomile tea extract. In contrast, no symptoms were observed after oral challenges with this infusion. IgE activity against chamomile tea and Matricaria and Artemisia extracts (composite pollens) was detected by ELISA in the seven patients' sera. A cross reactivity among the above extracts was observed by an ELISA inhibition study. In all cases, the IgE activity to chamomile tea could fully be absorbed by Matricaria pollen extract. Skin prick tests and conjunctival provocation tests also performed in 100 hay fever controls revealed a positive immediate skin response to Artemisia in 15 patients, eight of them also to Matricaria pollen and five of them to Chamomile tea as well. Only two of the last patients had a positive conjunctival response. The results were negative in the rest of the controls. We conclude that the chamomile tea eye washing can induce allergic conjunctivitis. Matricaria chamomilla pollens contained in these infusions are the allergens responsible for these reactions.\r"

The aim of this study was to establish whether tachyphylaxis in response to repeated inhalations with adenosine occurs in asthmatic subjects. Eight asthmatic patients were studied on three separate days (days A, B, and C) at the same time of day for each subject. Three inhalation tests were performed, separated by one hour, on each study day. The study was conducted in a double-blind fashion and performed in random order. On day A, three adenosine inhalation tests were performed to assess adenosine tachyphylaxis. On day B, a saline inhalation test was carried out between two adenosine challenges to assess the time course of the adenosine tachyphylaxis. On day C, three methacholine inhalation tests were performed to confirm that tachyphylaxis does not occur to methacholine. Repeated inhalation with adenosine, but not methacholine, produced a progressive loss of responsiveness to the nucleoside, which was particularly manifest with the third challenge.\r"

High levels of CD4+ lymphocytes and high CD4/CD8 ratios were found in both patients and their relatives, as compared with normal age-matched and sex-matched controls. This immunologic abnormality, together with the presence of autoantibodies previously reported in the apparently normal relatives, seems to be the hallmark of the disease. Further support of this interpretation comes from the observation that two out of the 23 apparently healthy relatives went on to develop vitiligo in a 2-year follow-up.\r"

Skin tests and RAST were positive for grain flours. Normally, the patient tolerated grain flours without symptoms and IgE mechanisms had not been suspected. Testing for food hypersensitivity may be important in patients with EIA.\r"

The sera were tested on a fixed panel of allergens, regardless of the patient's history. The association of a positive RAST with age and month of birth was studied. It was concluded that among the inhalant allergens, house-dust mite was the most frequent sensitizer for all age groups, followed by grass pollen and cat dander. Sensitization to cat dander occurred twice as often as sensitization to dog dander. Among children less than 4 years of age, a different profile of sensitization was found, indoor allergens (mites, animal danders) being more important than outdoor allergens (pollen). Furthermore, we found that children born during December-February had a slightly but significantly greater chance of becoming sensitized to grass pollen compared with children born during September and November (P less than .05). Children born during July-September had a greater chance of becoming sensitized to house dust mite compared with children born during January-March (P less than .05). Finally, it was found that children born during October-December had a greater chance of becoming sensitized to dog dander compared with children born during March-May.\r"

  ".U": "90343131\r", 
  ".W": "Patients with chronic airflow obstruction (CAO) frequently develop abnormal thoraco-abdominal excursion, but the patterns described are inconsistent and the factors that relate to their development remain unknown. We studied 45 stable patients with FEV1 ranging from 0.36 to 2.1 L. A pattern of ventilatory muscle recruitment (VMR) was established by simultaneously measuring gastric (Pg) and pleural (Ppl) pressures and rib cage (Vrc) and abdominal (Vab) volume displacement with inductance plethysmography. From these tracings, Pg-Ppl plots were constructed and the delta Pg/delta Ppl values were calculated. The delta Pg/delta Ppl was validated in 15 patients with simultaneous analysis of Vab-Pg plots. Pearson's test and multiple regression analyses were used to correlate delta Pg/delta Ppl to factors thought to influence respiratory muscle function such as age, sex, nutritional status (weight/height, albumin), hyperinflation, airflow obstruction, and arterial blood gases. We found a direct correlation between a more positive delta Pg/delta Ppl value and increasing hyperinflation (r = 0.69, p less than 0.0001), increasing airflow obstruction (r = -0.55, p less than 0.001), and decreasing diaphragmatic strength (r2 = 0.32, p less than 0.001). We also found that expiratory Ppl became more positive with decreasing FEV1 (r2 = 0.33, p less than 0.001). This change in VMR was independent of age, sex, nutritional status, and arterial blood gas determinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
