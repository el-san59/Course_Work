  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Chronic low back pain is a common problem with many treatments, few of which have been rigorously evaluated. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of injections of corticosteroid into facet joints to treat chronic low back pain. METHODS. Patients with chronic low back pain who reported immediate relief of their pain after injections of local anesthetic into the facet joints between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae and the fifth lumbar and first sacral vertebrae were randomly assigned to receive under fluoroscopic guidance injections of either methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg; n = 49) or isotonic saline (n = 48) in the same facet joints. Ninety-five patients were followed for six months and their condition assessed with scales of pain severity, back mobility, and limitation of function. RESULTS. After one month, none of the outcome measures evaluating pain, functional status, and back flexion differed clinically or statistically between the two study groups. Forty-two percent of the patients who received methylprednisolone and 33 percent of those who received placebo reported marked or very marked improvement (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 28 percentage points; P = 0.53). The results were similar after three months. At the six-month evaluation, the patients treated with methylprednisolone reported more improvement, less pain on the visual-analogue scale, and less physical disability. The differences were reduced, however, when concurrent interventions were taken into account. Moreover, only 11 patients (22 percent) in the methylprednisolone group and 5 (10 percent) in the placebo group had sustained improvement from the first month to the sixth month (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -2 to 26; P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that injecting methylprednisolone acetate into the facet joints is of little value in the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The amount of alcohol ingested by a breast-fed infant is only a small fraction of that consumed by its mother, but even this small amount may have an effect on the infant. We investigated whether the ingestion of alcohol by a lactating woman altered the odor of her milk and whether exposure to a small amount of alcohol in the mother's milk had immediate effects on the behavior of the infant. METHODS. Twelve lactating women and their infants were tested on two days separated by an interval of one week. On each testing day, the mother expressed a small quantity of breast milk and then drank either orange juice or orange juice containing a small quantity of ethanol (0.3 g per kilogram of body weight). Additional milk samples were obtained at fixed intervals after the ingestion of the beverage and analyzed to determine their ethanol content. The samples were also evaluated by a panel of adults to determine whether any difference in the odor of the milk was detectable after alcohol ingestion. The infants were weighed before and after nursing to assess the amount of milk they ingested, and their behavior during breast-feeding was monitored by videotape. RESULTS. Short-term alcohol consumption by lactating women significantly and uniformly increased the perceived intensity of the odor of their milk as assessed by the panel; this increase in the intensity of the odor peaked 30 minutes to 1 hour after the alcohol was consumed and decreased thereafter. The alteration in the odor of the milk closely paralleled the changes in the concentration of ethanol in the milk (mean range, 0 to 6.9 mmol per liter [0 to 32 mg per deciliter]). The infants sucked more frequently during the first minute of feedings after their mothers had consumed alcohol (67.0 +/- 6.5 sucks, as compared with 58.4 +/- 5.9 sucks for feedings after the consumption of the nonalcoholic beverage; P less than 0.05), but they consumed significantly less milk (120.4 +/- 9.5 ml vs. 156.4 +/- 8.2 ml, P less than 0.001) during the testing sessions in which their mothers drank the alcoholic beverage. CONCLUSIONS. Although the mechanisms underlying this reduction in milk intake remain to be elucidated, this study shows that short-term alcohol consumption by nursing mothers has an immediate effect on the sensory characteristics (odor) of their milk and the feeding behavior of their infants.\r"

There is also a similar circadian pattern in several physiologic variables, including blood pressure, suggesting that certain dynamic processes may contribute to the circadian distribution and onset of acute events. METHODS. To determine whether there are circadian variations in vascular tone and to investigate their underlying mechanisms, we measured blood flow and vascular resistance in the forearm and their responses to phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic-antagonist drug) and sodium nitroprusside (a direct vasodilator) in 12 normal subjects (7 men and 5 women; mean age [+/- SD], 44 +/- 9 years) at three different times of day (7 a.m., 2. p.m., and 9 p.m.). The drugs were infused into the brachial artery, and the responses were measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. RESULTS. The basal forearm vascular resistance was significantly higher, and the blood flow significantly lower, in the morning than in the afternoon and evening (mean vascular resistance, 31 +/- 8, 25 +/- 6, and 22 +/- 7 mm Hg per milliliter per minute per 100 ml of forearm volume, respectively; P less than 0.01). The vasodilator effect of phentolamine was also significantly greater in the morning (mean decrease in vascular resistance, 38 +/- 6 percent) than in the afternoon (26 +/- 6 percent) and evening (21 +/- 7 percent) (P less than 0.05). Consequently, there was no circadian variation in vascular resistance or blood flow after the infusion of this drug. In contrast, the vasodilation in response to sodium nitroprusside was similar at all three times of day. CONCLUSIONS. There is a circadian rhythm in basal vascular tone, due either partly or entirely to increased alpha-sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity during the morning. This variation may contribute to higher blood pressure and the increased incidence of cardiovascular events at this time of day.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematologic disorder characterized by hemoglobinuria, thrombosis, infection, and a tendency toward bone marrow aplasia. Onset usually occurs in adulthood. Few children and adolescents with PNH have been described, and data on diagnosis, clinical course, and survival in young patients are unavailable. METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data on all patients 21 years old or younger in whom PNH had been diagnosed at Duke University Medical Center from 1966 to 1991. RESULTS. Medical records and clinical follow-up data were available for 26 young patients. Although 50 percent of adult patients present with hemoglobinuria, only four of our patients (15 percent) presented with this feature. In contrast, 15 of our patients (58 percent) had moderate or severe bone marrow failure at presentation, as compared with about 25 percent of adults in cases from the literature; all 26 patients eventually had evidence of bone marrow dysfunction. Eight patients (31 percent) have died, with a median survival of 13.5 years since their initial symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Children and adolescents with PNH have a greater prevalence of bone marrow failure than do adults with this disorder, and their morbidity and mortality are high. Bone marrow transplantation should be considered for selected young patients with PNH.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Atherosclerosis is characterized by endothelial injury and the proliferation of arterial smooth-muscle cells. The latter may be a result of the release of growth factors from the vessel wall; such growth factors may include an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor for peptide with mitogenic properties. We tested the hypothesis that plasma endothelin concentrations are elevated in persons with symptomatic atherosclerosis, independently of age. METHODS. We measured plasma endothelin levels in 100 normal subjects and in 40 patients with atherosclerosis predominantly of the following types: aortic and peripheral vascular disease (14 patients), renovascular disease (9 patients) coronary artery disease (9 patients), and carotid disease (8 patients). We also performed immunohistochemical staining for endothelin in the walls of atherosclerotic vessels. RESULTS. In the normal subjects, the mean (+/- SD) plasma endothelin concentration was 1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol per liter, with no correlation between age and plasma endothelin concentration (r = 0.13, P = 0.2). In the patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis, the mean plasma endothelin concentration was 3.2 +/- 1.2 pmol per liter (P less than 0.001), and there was a significant correlation between plasma endothelin and the number of sites of disease involvement (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001). In the immunohistochemical studies, endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity was observed in vascular smooth muscle as well as in endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS. Endothelin may be a marker for arterial vascular disease. Whether it participates in the atherogenic process or is merely released from damaged endothelial cells is unclear.\r"

It has been shown that this procedure, as performed in high-level medical research centers, usually produces no permanent adverse effects and can effectively ameliorate parkinsonian signs in certain patients. This progress has served to reinforce our commitment to develop neural transplantation into an effective therapy to treat such a devastating neurodegenerative disease. We have summarized the most important events that have shaped the initial phase of this research. In the course of the last 4 years, considerable knowledge has been gained in the clinical neurosciences regarding the real potential of various brain grafting procedures in treating Parkinson's disease, their shortcomings, and their usefulness in carefully selected patients. There is still no consensus regarding the various fundamental aspects of human brain grafting in Parkinson's disease. Questions concerning surgical technique, candidate selection, the optimal brain regions for implantation, the optimal tissue for implantation, and the real usefulness of brain grafting must be addressed. The importance of the quality of adrenal medulla fragments for grafting, the requirement for immunosuppressors in fetal brain grafting, and the optimal fetal age and the amount of donor tissue for effective grafting are additional areas of concern. The potential of xenografting, preserved tissues, and genetically engineered cells for human brain grafting remain unanswered. The development of human neural transplantation is the responsibility and privilege of neurosurgery.\r"

Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia.\r"

The study was carried out in two parts: 1) effect of intravenous nicardipine (n = 45) and 2) effect of intracisternal nicardipine (n = 21). SAH was induced by injecting 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. In the intravenous study, there were five groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with vehicle (saline); 3) SAH and intravenous infusion of low-dose nicardipine (0.01 mg/kg/h); 4) SAH and intravenous infusion of high-dose nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg/h); and 5) controls without SAH. The intravenous infusions were started immediately after SAH and continued for 48 hours until death. In the intracisternal study, there were three groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with intracisternal administration of nicardipine (0.37 mg/h); and 3) controls without SAH. Intracisternal infusions were begun 70 hours after SAH and continued for 2 hours until death. After perfusion-fixation, the basilar artery was removed and processed for morphometric analysis. In the intravenous study, vessels from animals subjected to SAH were significantly narrowed when compared with controls, although after high-dose nicardipine vessel caliber was slightly larger than in the other SAH groups. Animals given intracisternal nicardipine showed a nonsignificant reduction of caliber as compared with controls: only 12% decrease in diameter and 22% decrease in luminal area. In the rabbit SAH model, nicardipine had a very modest effect on vasospasm at the doses tested.\r"

The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients.

Surgery had reduced the median serum prolactin (PRL) value from 613 micrograms/l, a reduction of 53%. Postoperative bromocriptine was administered to 21 of the 25 patients. In 14 of these patients, serum PRL values became normal or almost normal with medication. There were no radiological or ophthalmological signs of progressive tumor growth during bromocriptine treatment. Fourteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy. After withdrawal of bromocriptine in 13 of these patients an average of 7 years after radiotherapy, the median serum PRL value had further decreased by 95%. The PRL reduction was similar for all doses applied, 38 to 52 Gy. After withdrawal of bromocriptine in 8 patients not receiving radiotherapy an average of 7 years after operation, the median serum PRL level had further decreased by 75%. At follow-up, 18 additional instances of pituitary insufficiency had developed in the group receiving radiotherapy, compared with 8 cases of insufficiency in the group not receiving radiotherapy. Thus, because bromocriptine has a long-standing effect on prolactin secretion, and radiotherapy is associated with a notably high incidence of pituitary insufficiency, we propose that photon irradiation should be considered mainly for patients who are not candidates for surgical or medical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 298 cases of ependymoma, survival analysis identified some prognostic histological factors but failed to demonstrate a worse survival for the anaplastic variant diagnosed with the common criteria used for assessing anaplasia in primitive brain tumors. This finding suggests that either anaplastic ependymoma does not exist, or that the established criteria are not useful in its identification. To solve these problems, the association of histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural signs in 173 intracranial cases was investigated and analyzed by means of contingency tables. Many signs had only focal distribution. Some signs, meaningful for anaplasia, such as very high cell density and number of mitoses, were found to be associated, whereas other signs usually considered indicative of anaplasia, such as endothelial hyperplasia, glomeruli, and necrosers, were not. In addition, pseudorosettes, mesodermic areas, and incomplete formation of perivascular pseudorosettes were signs associated with very high cell density and number of mitoses. Distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, as well as other immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features, were not helpful, with the exception of microsettes found by electron microscopy. Our conclusion is that the anaplastic variant of ependymoma is recognizable only when some histological prognostic factors, such as cell density and number of mitoses, are maximally expressed.\r"

The number of AgNORs (mean +/- SD) in the vascular and neoplastic cells of various tumors tested was as follows: benign astrocytoma (Grade 2, n = 4), 1.52 +/- 0.07 and 1.80 +/- 0.13, respectively; anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade 3, n = 7), 1.98 +/- 0.23 and 2.87 +/- 0.50; and glioblastoma multiforme (Grade 4, n = 11), 2.05 +/- 0.29 and 3.13 +/- 1.13. AgNOR scores in vascular cells of benign astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of vascular cells in normal brain tissue without neoplastic alteration (1.26 +/- 0.05; n = 3; P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the AgNOR scores of vascular cells in high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4) were significantly higher than those in low-grade gliomas (Grade 2) (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that the proliferative activity of both vascular and neoplastic cells in gliomas increased as histological malignancy advanced, and that the quantification of AgNORs was useful in evaluating proliferative activity in vascular cells as well as in assessing the malignancy of neoplastic tissues.\r"

We subdivided each group according to time of surgery: early and delayed (less than 24 and greater than 24 hours past injury, respectively). In Group A, 10 patients underwent early surgery and 40 patients underwent delayed surgery (range, 2 to 77 days past injury; mean, 13 days). One patient (2.5%) in the delayed group died. The following data refer to the early and delayed subgroups, respectively: average acute hospitalization, 20 and 22 days; patient motor score improvement (at discharge), 37.2 and 45.0%; functional grade improvement (at discharge), 5 (50.0%) and 9 (22.5%) patients. At 1-year follow-up, every patient who had had a deficit had progressed to a higher functional grade.

Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required.\r"

Overall, 28 patients (18%) had a functional outcome: 14 patients (9%) made a good recovery and 14 were moderately disabled. Sixteen patients (10.5%) were severely disabled or vegetative, and 104 (60%) died. Compared with patients who died or were left severely disabled or vegetative, patients who had a good recovery were younger (21 versus 38 years), were significantly more likely to be children (less than or equal to 17 years old) and have anisocoria and a deteriorating Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and were significantly less likely to be flaccid or have bilaterally fixed pupils; moderately disabled patients also had a lower median age and a higher frequency of anisocoria. There was no difference in the incidence of significant intracranial hematomas between patients with a functional outcome and those with a nonfunctional outcome. Twenty-seven percent of the 95 patients with anisocoria had a good outcome or moderate disability, whereas only 3.5% of the 58 patients with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils at admission had a functional recovery (P less than 0.05). Age, level of consciousness, and the degree of residual upper brain stem function at admission appear to be the most important determinants of functional outcome after traumatic transtentorial herniation.\r"

Pressure was also measured in the sagittal sinus, cisterna magna, and femoral artery. CV pressure has not previously been measured in hydrocephalus. Ventricular volume was determined by computed tomography. Four groups of animals were studied. In Group 1 (n = 5) transmantle pressure was measured; in Group 2 (n = 5), transparenchymal pressure in normal animals was measured. In Group 3 (n = 5) was measured all the pressures in spontaneously normal animals, and in Group 4 (n = 6) was measured the pressures in hydrocephalic animals. The pressure-volume index and CSF outflow resistance were also measured. LV volume in the normal dogs was 1.3 +/- 0.7 ml and in the hydrocephalic dogs was 5.1 +/- 2.7 ml (P less than 0.005). Although LV, subarachnoid space, and sagittal sinus pressures were elevated in the hydrocephalic dogs (15.1 versus 10.2, 16.4 versus 10.5, and 8.4 versus 5.2 mm Hg, respectively), the transmantle pressure and subarachnoid space to sagittal sinus gradients were not significantly altered. CV pressure was markedly elevated in the hydrocephalic animals (21.5 versus 11.7 mm Hg, P less than 0.005). The pressure-volume index and outflow resistance were not significantly different. These results suggest that an elevated CV pressure plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of hydrocephalus, and that the pathway for CSF absorption includes transcapillary or transvenular absorption of CSF from the interstitial space.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure peaked about 2 minutes after the initiation of neck flexion and then decreased gradually to the baseline level within a few minutes. These responses were suppressed completely by administration of the ganglion blocker trimethaphan camsilate, which suggests that the efferent pathway of the response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 2 minutes of apnea during endotracheal intubation on intracranial pressure (ICP), compliance, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) was studied in 19 adult dogs during normo-, hypo-, and hypercapnia. The compliance was measured from the cisterna magna in response to an intrathecal bolus injection (pressure-volume index). CBV was monitored by radiolabeled red blood cell activity. These measurements were made before and after 2 minutes of apnea. At normocapnia (pCO2 of 35-40 mm Hg), a period of apnea resulted in an increase in ICP from 9.6 to 26.3 mm Hg, a decrease in compliance from 0.051 to 0.020 ml/mm Hg (60%), and an increase in CBV of 0.26 ml (9.6%). When the animals were hypocapnic (pCO2 of 24-28 mm Hg), ICP increased from 12.8 to 19.6 mm Hg, compliance fell from 0.041 to 0.029 ml/mm Hg(29%), and CBV increased 0.07 ml (3.1%). Hypercapnia (pCO2 of 50-58 mm Hg) before apnea resulted in an increase in ICP from 21.5 to 47.1 mm Hg, a decrease in compliance from 0.032 to 0.015 ml/mm Hg (52%), and an increase in CBV of 0.41 ml (13.4%). These results suggest that hyperventilation (hypocapnia) before intubation limits the adverse decrease in brain compliance and increase in ICP by reducing changes in cerebral blood volume.\r"

  ".W": "The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction (\"idling neurons\"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed.\r"

The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter.

We review and discuss these cases according to their clinical presentation, the segmental location of the granulomas in the spinal cord, preoperative and operative diagnoses, and signs for systemic sarcoidosis. In none of the cases was the diagnosis of intramedullary sarcoidosis made before surgery. We think that surgical therapy for intramedullary lesions is the best way to diagnose rare instances of benign lesions like sarcoidosis and to treat them in an appropriate manner.\r"

The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass.\r"

The clinical features of this condition may involve both ischemic episodes and hemorrhages. Posterior circulation is affected less than the rest of the intracranial arteries, and it is extremely rare to find the posterior cerebral arteries only affected. Mortality is high in patients where the lesion is located in the posterior intracranial circulation, although dissecting aneurysms limited to the posterior cerebral arteries may, to a certain extent, be benign. We report the case of a young woman with ischemia in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery that occurred subsequent to a dissecting aneurysm that resolved spontaneously to a complete remission, both clinically and as demonstrated by angiography. A review of the literature is made, analyzing the pathogenic, clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of such lesions.\r"

Five hundred and thirteen patients could be evaluated at 3 months after surgery. Stepwise logistic regression showed that the factors of fraction of pain referred to the back, work-related injury, absence of back pain on straight leg-raise examination, correspondence of leg pain to typical radicular patterns, leg pain on straight leg-raise examination, and reflex asymmetry were independently predictive of good outcome from surgery. Univariate analysis of the case with different numbers of predictive factors present showed that use of the operating microscope, sensory deficit, central disc bulge, and free disc fragment were correlated with outcome only in subgroups. An analysis of unsatisfactory outcomes showed two patterns: one of failure as a result of mechanical back pain and one of failure as a result of radiculopathy. Factors predictive of outcome did not influence the type of failure. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis, facetectomy and preoperative sensory deficit were associated with increased likelihood of mechanical back pain failure, while preoperative motor deficit was associated with an increased likelihood of radicular failure. The results support several intuitively derived and commonly believed principles of lumbar disc surgery.\r"

This paper describes the development of a computer image-based educational system designed for neurosurgical instruction. The advantages and applications of this system for both clinical and academic use and the required software and hardware requirements are delineated. This computerized tutorial can organize and manipulate large amounts of data. The Neurosurgery Image Manager system contains an introductory help section, a self-assessment test in neurosurgery, and a data base of images from the video disc \"The Slice of Life,\" produced at the University of Utah. Questions are taken from the Self-Assessment in Neurological Surgery series. Additionally, the system contains a reference index for all material in the tutorial, a scored clinical problems section, and a several hundred word glossary. The system is programmed using the Macintosh Hypercard authoring system. Large data bases can be manipulated and linked with graphics, text, and peripherals. Images are stored using the MacVision II digitizing system. The hardware necessary to operate the system and the method of implementation of Neurosurgery Image Manager are described. The prototype Neurosurgery Image Manager has been accepted by the Joint Committee on Education of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons as one of the computer formats for the next self-assessment tests.\r"

Problems with facial growth can result in aesthetic and functional complaints. Using a simple method of clinical evaluation, the pediatrician can identify facial growth problems in the anteroposterior, vertical, and transverse dimensions. These problems can then be referred for evaluation and treatment by a variety of means. By adopting a contemporary view that facial growth is the result of genetic and environmental factors (some of which are functional), growth modification becomes a real possibility. Unfortunately, some problems must be camouflaged or treated by combined surgical and orthodontic means. Continued growth in early adulthood can enhance or detract from treatment results obtained in childhood or adolescence. These dynamic properties of the face make management of facial growth challenging but generally rewarding and successful because of substantial aesthetic and functional improvements.\r"

Accurate assessment of the face with measurement leads to better diagnosis and ultimately better patient care. All children with facial defects deserve early intervention by a multidisciplined craniofacial team including geneticists, surgeons, dentists, speech pathologists, and other specialists. Part of the process of early referral to this team involves early detection and recognition in the neonatal period. It is hoped that this article stimulates the pediatrician to be aware of these abnormalities, recognize their importance, and seek additional help for patients, no matter what their age.\r"

  ".W": "We have attempted to elucidate, first through an examination of the basic science of clefting and then through a description of the roles of the various members of the cleft palate team, an understanding of the multiplicity of problems faced by this heterogeneous group of children with cleft lip or palate. With an incidence of cleft of 1 in 700 births, all practicing pediatricians will at some time be faced with a patient with a cleft. Pediatric management begins in the hospital nursery by ruling out possible associated anomalies (e.g., congenital heart disease or urinary tract) or syndromes. At the same time, cleft palate nursers may be needed to overcome feeding problems. Simultaneously, counseling for the family begins with a positive attitude toward outcome and an initial explanation of the schedule of corrective procedures, i.e., lip repair at 3 months of age and palate repair at about 1 year. The counseling should incorporate an understanding of the cause of clefting, both its genetics and teratogenetics, and then proceed to noting the actual recurrence risks of 1% for a new cleft and 16% if there is a positive family history in a first-degree relative. The recurrence risks in recognized syndromes may follow mendelian patterns. Later, the pediatrician can help the family deal with multiple ear infections and the likely need for tympanostomy tubes, anticipating the need for tubes in a way that might facilitate placement at the time of anesthesia for the lip or the palate repairs. An understanding of the speech and language difficulties that may be encountered in later infancy may relieve parental anxiety. Later, after palate repair, knowledge of velopharyngeal incompetence may avert premature hypernasal speech problems caused by adenoidectomy, which should be avoided if at all possible. The pediatrician needs to be aware of the tooth malformations that accompany clefting of the alveolus as well as the increased susceptibility to caries, so that the family may be directed to early intervention by the pediatric dentist. With support by pediatrics of the efforts of pediatric dentistry, the child is then in optimal condition for orthodontics. Continually keeping the child's emotional adjustment in mind, the pediatrician can encourage the child and family, knowing that with palatal expansion techniques plus possible bone graft surgery to the cleft alveolus at about 9 years of age, the child may be orthodontically corrected to very near normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Periodontal diseases in children and adolescents include chronic gingivitis, gingival recession, chronic periodontitis, prepubertal periodontitis, juvenile periodontitis, and cases with peculiar causes. The main cause for periodontal diseases is the microorganisms in the dental plaque. In addition, the systemic status of the individual may affect the response of the periodontal tissues and vice versa. The physician and dentist should cooperate with the purpose of providing comprehensive prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases and systemic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Although we have the knowledge and technology necessary to prevent it, most children experience dental disease, and a few children continue to experience high rates of decay. The appropriateness and effectiveness of preventive measures vary throughout the life of a child, and recommendations should be tailored to the needs of the individual. Water fluoridation continues to be the most cost-effective preventive measure available. For patients who do not have access to fluoridated water, dietary supplementation offers similar benefits. A wide variety of professionally applied and home use topical fluoride products such as dentrifrices, gels, and rinses can also reduce the risk of dental caries, particularly on the smooth surfaces of the teeth. The most common site of decay in children is the fissures of the molar teeth. These areas can be protected by the professional application of plastic sealants. Dietary practices influence caries rates, and patients should be advised to limit the frequency of carbohydrate exposures rather than the total amount of carbohydrates consumed. Parents of infants should be advised to discontinue bottle feeding around the age of 12 months to avoid nursing caries. Although oral hygiene practices are not as effective in reducing caries rates as is generally believed, daily toothbrushing and flossing are unquestionably effective in preventing periodontal disease. In order to be maximally effective, preventive efforts should be initiated early in the life of the child. Although most children experience dental disease, a mouth free of caries and periodontal disease is a potentially attainable goal for all children when they use currently available techniques.\r"

All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy after MR imaging. MR imaging, surgical, and pathologic data were correlated relative to tumor location and volume, Gleason grade, presence of capsular penetration, and depth of NVB invasion. The sensitivity of MR imaging for invasion was 68%, specificity was 59%, and overall accuracy was 64%. Results of this study indicate that MR imaging can help identify the NVB and predict invasion of the NVB by tumor, but the usefulness of the technique is limited by the lack of spatial resolution associated with use of the whole-body coil.\r"

The only complication observed was transient postembolization hemiparesis, which occurred in one of the 30 patients. Intractable idiopathic epistaxis is defined as epistaxis of unknown cause that is refractory to nasal packing. Such epistaxis is commonly treated with surgical intervention, including ligation of the terminal segments of the internal maxillary artery and the ethmoid arteries. An alternative approach is performance of endovascular therapy. In our opinion, embolization is a safe and effective procedure when it is carried out by appropriately trained personnel. In most patients, its performance requires use of only neuroleptanalgesia; surgery can be avoided, and the duration of hospitalization is significantly shortened. We recommend that embolization be adopted as the primary modality for the treatment of idiopathic intractable epistaxis.\r"

The sensitivity (defined as the true-positive rate) with high-field MR imaging was superior to that with low-field MR imaging and CT in helping detect overall abnormalities. Sensitivities were generally similar over a broad range of specific cranial central nervous system diseases. Low-field and high-field MR imaging were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of neoplasms and white matter disease, whereas low-field MR and CT were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of contusion, subdural and epidural hematoma, sinus disease, normality, and abnormality. The specificities with low-field MR imaging and CT were substantially better than those with high-field MR imaging.\r"

Five fetuses with either infantile polycystic kidney disease (n = 4) or bilateral multicystic dysplasia (n = 1) did not survive. Oligohydramnios was predictive of a poor prognosis.

In only six cases were the masses to be localized in an area of the breast that contained other mammographic opacities that could have led to problems of identification. The patients were first studied with freehand US. Results were then compared with those subsequently obtained with a fenestrated mammographic compression grid to guide the US evaluation. Needle localization was then performed. In five of 50 cases, masses detected with freehand US and initially believed to correspond to the mammographically detected mass were subsequently found to represent different areas of the breast when US was used with the compression grid. These results suggest that the potential for misidentification of masses with freehand US is real and that a mammographic grid localization device can be used to overcome this problem.\r"

Invasion was diagnosed on the basis of whether an air space existed between the mass and the adjacent structures. In three patients pneumothorax was not produced. After the procedure, four patients developed symptomatic pneumothorax, and one, subcutaneous emphysema. Comparison of diagnoses based on findings at pneumothorax CT, surgery, and pathologic examination showed that pneumothorax CT is 100% accurate for chest wall invasion and 76% accurate for mediastinal invasion. The authors conclude that this procedure is helpful in accurate evaluation of the T criterion in lung cancer, especially for patients in whom findings at conventional CT suggest tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum.\r"

Pathologic and/or microbiologic diagnoses were available for all patients. All patients were immunocompromised due to either graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), neutropenia, or recurrent malignancy after BMT. CT demonstrated diagnostically relevant findings that were not apparent at radiography in 12 of the 21 cases (57%). These included a ground-glass pattern in early pneumonia (n = 5); a peripheral distribution in GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic drug reaction (n = 4); cavitating lesions in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (n = 1); hemorrhagic infarcts in aspergillosis (n = 1); and mediastinal adenopathy in recurrent Hodgkin disease (n = 1). The authors conclude that chest CT is superior to radiography in demonstrating the presence, distribution, and extent of intrathoracic complications developing in patients after allogeneic BMT. CT is useful in guiding procedures for tissue diagnosis.\r"

Conventional 10-mm CT sections were equivalent to 1.2-mm HRCT sections in the recognition of nodules, masses, nodular irregularities of the interfaces, large cystic air spaces, and architectural distortion. Conventional CT was superior to HRCT in the diagnosis of micronodules and infiltrates. However, 15% of micronodules were recognized only on HRCT images because of their small size and low density. Fine bronchial and parenchymal lesions were best seen on HRCT scans. HRCT was the only technique that allowed assessment of the presence of areas of ground-glass attenuation. HRCT improves visualization of small parenchymal structures and allows a confident evaluation of DILD, providing that the entire lungs are studied. Nevertheless, an optimal CT evaluation of micronodular patterns requires additional thick-section CT scans.\r"

Patients with drug-induced hypercalciuria included 10 infants treated with furosemide, two treated with long-term steroid therapy, and one treated with excessive amounts of vitamin D. Other clinical conditions associated with hypercalciuria included renal tubular acidosis (n = 10), Bartter syndrome (n = 5), hyperparathyroidism (n = 3), Williams syndrome (n = 2) and medullary sponge kidney (n = 2). Ten children with transient renal insufficiency and three with sickle cell disease had normal urine calcium concentration. Isolated disease entities accounted for the remainder of cases. A specific diagnosis can usually be made in a patient with hyperechoic renal medullary pyramids by using a systematic clinical approach that includes evaluation of patient age, serum and urine calcium concentration, and renal function.\r"

Comparison of spectra in our patients with those of children with normal myelination (prominent signals from N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine/phosphocreatine, and choline) revealed a marked decrease of NAA in 12 of 17 patients with focal or generalized demyelination. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA signal intensity was markedly increased, but no choline signal was found. Increased signal intensity from lactate occurred in patients with Leigh disease, neuroaxonal dystrophy, Schilder disease, and Cockayne disease, which indicated a disturbed energy metabolism in the examined region. These results demonstrate that proton MR spectroscopy can be applied in a clinical environment to facilitate diagnosis of hereditary and acquired brain disorders in children.\r"

US images of the normal gastric walls of 16 patients with gastric ulcers served as controls. Characteristic features of scirrhous carcinoma included an irregular hypoechoic enlargement of the third (submucosa) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers. The mean thickness of the third and fourth layers was increased sixfold and threefold, respectively, compared with thickness in healthy subjects. In the patients with scirrhous carcinoma, the mucosal layer remained normal in appearance at US, and it was possible to distinguish the five-layer structure of the gastric wall. These findings were prospectively correlated with histopathologic findings in the resected specimens. In contrast, only the mucosal layer was thickened in cases of hypertrophic gastritis. Recognition of these patterns at US can aid in the differential diagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma and such benign diseases as hypertrophic gastritis with a thickened gastric wall.\r"

Lesions without macroscopic nodules are defined as early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while those with a macroscopic component are defined as HCC with early components. A comparative study of early HCC and HCC with early components was performed with magnetic resonance imaging. Early HCC lesions (n = 20) were isointense (n = 11) and hyperintense (n = 9) on T1-weighted spin-echo images and isointense (n = 17), partially hyperintense (n = 2), or hypointense (n = 1) on T2-weighted spin-echo images relative to the surrounding liver. Lesions classified as HCC with early components (n = 8) were hyperintense (n = 5), isointense (n = 2), and of mixed signal intensity (n = 1) on T2-weighted images. T1-weighted imaging was superior to T2-weighted imaging in depicting early HCC, but the latter could be useful in evaluating the progression of HCC in the histopathologically early stages.\r"

Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients.\r"

All patients underwent abdominal radiography, followed by a barium enema study. In the appropriate clinical setting, radiographic diagnosis of a splenic flexure volvulus is suggested when the following are seen: (a) a markedly dilated, air-filled colon wtih an abrupt termination at the anatomic splenic flexure; (b) two widely separated air-fluid levels, one in the transverse colon and the other in the cecum; (c) an empty descending and sigmoid colon; and (d) a characteristic beak at the anatomic splenic flexure at a barium enema examination.\r"

Phantoms and a clinical case were used to demonstrate that when a lipid-water interface is curvilinear (eg, spherical) or planar but not oriented along the section-select direction, CSA may be absent or diminished. This effect can be seen at interfaces of normal structures (kidneys, bladder) as well as at interfaces with pathologic lesions such as lipid-containing dermoids. Not only is this effect dependent on section thickness, field of view, matrix size, and receiver bandwidth, but it is also strongly dependent on the orientation of the interface with respect to the section-select direction. Knowledge of the factors that can alter CSA is important since it is used to distinguish lipid-containing from nonlipid-containing structures of similar signal intensities.\r"

Clean shadowing is thought to be produced by sound-absorbing materials (ie, stones), and dirty shadowing is thought to be produced by sound-reflecting materials (ie, abdominal gas), but these properties are not consistent. To evaluate the characteristics of shadows behind different objects at US, the authors scanned two renal stones and a bovine femur (each of which had part of its surface artificially smoothed or roughened) and a tissue-mimicking phantom comprising air-containing cylinders of different radii of curvature. The rougher and/or smaller the radius of curvature of the surface insonified by the sound beam, the cleaner was the shadow, independent of the composition of the underlying reflecting medium. Clean and dirty shadowing were primarily related to the properties of the surface of the shadowing object and provided little information about the structural nature of the object.\r"

A low-frequency acoustic source was used to induce vibration in tissue under examination, and a color Doppler ultrasound (US) instrument was modified to detect vibration amplitude. The resulting image is a color \"map\" of tissue vibration superimposed on conventional gray-scale US images. Stiffer tissues vibrated less in response to audible sound, regardless of echogenicity. Normal human and canine prostate glands demonstrated a uniform vibration pattern. Four of four human prostatic adenocarcinomas and two stiff inclusions injected into canine prostate glands demonstrated a lack of vibration in comparison with normal surrounding tissue. The authors conclude that while further study is necessary, sonoelasticity imaging may enhance the detection of neoplasms by enabling their identification solely on the basis of stiffness.\r"

The frequency shifts determined by means of different Doppler frequencies (2.31 or 3.75 MHz) were converted into flow velocities. Only the highest systolic peak flow velocity obtained from a lesion was used for statistical evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that a flow velocity of 0.4 m/sec is the optimal threshold value with which to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. The data obtained in all lesions indicated that only positive findings are potentially reliable. It is concluded that negative results of sonography should not be used to diagnose the presence of a benign lesion. The resistive index of the tumors was of negligible importance.\r"

The resulting complex, MION-IgG, had a slightly negative surface charge, a molecular weight of 150-180 kDa, and 0.36 microgram of IgG attached per milligram of iron. After intravenous administration of MION-IgG to normal rats, most of the compound localized in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. In an animal model of myositis, MION-IgG caused reduced signal intensity (most apparent on T2-weighted spin-echo and gradient-echo images) at the site of inflammation. No change in signal intensity existed after an injection of unlabeled MION. Site-specific localization of MION-IgG was corroborated with scintigraphic imaging with indium-111 IgG and MION-In-111-IgG and was confirmed histologically with iron staining. These results indicate that antibody MR imaging is feasible in vivo. Target-specific and antibody MR imaging could be easily extended to other applications, including detection of cancer, infarction, and degenerative diseases.\r"

In the analysis of 36 liver lesions, snapshot images were compared with corresponding T1-weighted spin-echo images on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of liver and contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) between liver and lesion. Snapshot MR imaging produced abdominal images with 192 (or 256) x 256 resolution, negligible motion artifact, and C/N 1.29 times (+/- 0.48) higher than that in T1-weighted spin-echo imaging. Acquisition times were 13 seconds or less, short enough for imaging during suspended respiration. Also, use of a phased-array multicoil further improves the S/N in snapshot images without acquisition-time penalty.\r"

Intact anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) were present in 29 patients; acute complete ACL tears, in 22; and chronic complete ACL tears, in 30. Acute tears were accurately distinguished from intact ligaments and were characterized by the presence of edema. Chronic tears had a more variable appearance: Nine (30%) were depicted at MR as intact bands with low signal intensity that bridged the expected origin and insertion of the ACL. This appearance is likely due to the presence of bridging fibrous scars within the intercondylar notch. Five of these nine cases were correctly characterized as chronically torn because of the presence of focal angulation. In four of these nine cases the scarred fragments produced a relatively straight band that mimicked an intact ligament. Although chronic and acute ACL tears usually have distinct findings at MR, a chronic tear will occasionally be difficult to distinguish from an intact ligament.\r"

Only asymptomatic knees (right, n = 10; left, n = 10) were examined; the images were reviewed blindly by one experienced observer without reference to the other examination. A significant progression existed in the grade of signal intensity shown in the menisci over the course of the season (P less than .001). Although this is a small study covering only 1 year, these preliminary results suggest that significant degeneration can occur in the menisci of asymptomatic players over a single season.\r"

Seven patients with muscular glycogenosis (six with McArdle disease and one with phosphofructokinase deficiency) showed only a slight variation in T2 (0%-17%) and no decrease in pH. Variations in T2 and in end-exercise pH were found to be correlated, perhaps reflecting the stimulation of muscular perfusion caused by acidosis.\r"

Flow-compensated (FC) and flow-encoded (FE) images are acquired continuously by using gradient echoes and a 12-msec repetition time. Each image is reconstructed within 200 msec of acquisition, and the FC magnitude image is displayed in gray-scale format. The phase difference between the reconstructed FC and FE images, a difference proportional to velocity along the flow-encoding direction, is encoded in color and superimposed on the gray-scale FC image. Magnitude and phase information are thus presented simultaneously. The viewer may interactively adjust many acquisition parameters during data acquisition. Experimental results of phantom and in vivo human studies validate the method. Characteristics of the color flow MR imaging technique are compared with those of duplex color ultrasound.\r"

The authors developed a new method of fat suppression--the opposed-fat saturation (OP-ES) sequence--that combines both techniques to obtain superior fat saturation. Fat suppression was verified in phantom studies, which showed that the CHESS portion can eliminate most of the aliphatic fat signal except for a small residual component because of steady state effects and magnetic field imperfections. This residual component is cancelled by the olefinic fat with the phase-selective opposed portion of the sequence. Furthermore, this sequence was superior to another hybrid technique, chopper Dixon in combination with CHESS. When used in 10 healthy volunteers, the OP-FS sequence showed consistently better suppression of the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat compared with CHESS alone. Additional advantages for clinical abdominal imaging include its compatibility with respiratory compensation, use of a single excitation, and ease of implementation with gradient-echo imaging. Preliminary application in 10 patients illustrated other potential advantages, including clarification of fat-containing diseases and increasing conspicuity of some lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous drainage of pelvic abscesses has been performed by using a number of approaches, including transabdominal, transgluteal, and transrectal. The authors present a technique for the drainage of pelvic abscesses by a transrectal route with use of computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Equipment for the technique included a plastic introducer tube, standard needle, angiographic guide wire, and pigtail catheters. The pelvic abscesses of 10 patients (six after appendectomy, three after colon resection, one secondary to diverticulitis) were successfully drained by using the new technique. No complications or recurrences were experienced. After initial catheter placement, patients were treated with use of gravity drainage and appropriate antibiotics. Success of drainage was determined with sequential CT scans. Compared with the transgluteal approach, the transrectal approach offered increased patient comfort and minimal risk of potential complications such as injury to the sciatic nerve or tracking of the abscess. Use of the plastic introducer tube promoted operator safety by protecting the guiding finger. On the basis of this initial series, CT-guided transrectal drainage appears to be an effective and well-tolerated method for the drainage of pelvic abscesses.\r"

Diagnosis was achieved in all 14 patients (100%), including one patient with suspected ovarian carcinoma who underwent only diagnostic needle aspiration and no therapeutic drainage. Abscesses or fluid collections were evacuated in 13 of 13 patients (100%) with either needle (n = 7) or catheter (n = 6) drainage (with appropriate antibiotics). Twelve of the 14 patients (86%) were spared an operation; surgery was undertaken in two patients for a persistent tubo-ovarian phlegmon. No major complications were associated with drainage. Catheters were removed an average of 6.7 days after insertion. The success, safety, and advantages of US-guided transvaginal drainage in our early experience suggest its use as an alternative to standard percutaneous catheter procedures to diagnose and drain certain pelvic abscesses and fluid collections.\r"

Although reports of lasers enabling recanalization after failure of guide wires have been numerous, direct comparisons of the success of the two techniques in a randomized trial have been few. The results of a randomized trial showed no statistical difference in recanalization of femoropopliteal occlusions between the conventional guide wire and hybrid laser probe. The number of patients with iliac occlusions was small and comparisons are difficult to make, but the findings suggest that the hybrid laser probe has little to offer. Immediate crossover to the alternative method allowed investigation of the relationship between the two methods in practice. Combining the two methods improved the primary success rate from 82% to 91% for femoropopliteal occlusions randomized to laser thermal recanalization and from 74% to 91% for those randomized to conventional recanalization.\r"

On average, patients underwent mild rejection (detected with endomyocardial biopsy) and had a reduced ratio of anterior myocardial phosphocreatine (PCr) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (1.57 +/- 0.50 [standard deviation] vs 1.93 +/- 0.2; P less than .01) compared with that of 17 healthy control subjects.

After administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA, there was clear and persistent demarcation of both occlusive and reperfused infarcts on T1-weighted MR images. In occlusive infarcts, normal, infarcted, and periinfarcted myocardium could be identified. High signal intensity was evident for 60 minutes in a band straddling the border between infarcted and normal myocardium, namely, the periinfarction zone. In the reperfused infarct, normal and infarcted myocardium could be identified. The reperfused zone was immediately enhanced after injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA. A differential pattern of enhancement between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts was evident for 1 hour. Thus, Gd-DTPA-BMA has the potential to allow (a) depiction of occlusive and reperfused acute myocardial infarcts, (b) documentation of reperfusion of myocardial infarction, and (c) distinction between occlusive and reperfused infarction.\r"

Color Doppler flow imaging allowed identification of nine macroaneurysms related to wall degeneration, two cases of spontaneous fistula formation between the graft and peripheral veins, and 20 stenoses. Use of color Doppler flow imaging led to overestimation of the degree of stenosis at the venous anastomosis when compared with use of angiography. Three cases of subclavian venous stenosis were identified only at angiography. Color Doppler flow imaging appears accurate in the detection of stenoses and seems sufficient for follow-up of normally functioning grafts. However, because of its low sensitivity for identification of proximal stenoses and the necessity of obtaining an angiogram to plan surgical or percutaneous correction, DSA remains the technique of choice.\r"

Surgical-pathologic findings were used as the standard of reference. In the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma, contrast-enhanced imaging improved tumor detection and differentiation between viable tumor and retained debris. Use of contrast material significantly improved the staging accuracy. The ability to assess the depth of myometrial invasion was also improved. In the evaluation of cervical carcinoma, assessment of tumor location and size did not improve following contrast enhancement. Use of gadopentetate dimeglumine resulted in overestimation of stromal, parametrial, vaginal, and/or bladder wall invasion in eight patients. However, evaluation of intratumoral architecture and large lesions was easier with contrast-enhanced imaging. When only stage II and higher disease was analyzed, use of contrast material improved the evaluation of disease extent. The authors conclude that gadolinium enhancement adds to the accuracy of evaluation of endometrial carcinoma but is useful in only advanced cases of cervical carcinoma.\r"

This bend results almost entirely from two 40 degrees kinks that occur between TG/CA base pairs at positions 5 and 6 on each side of the dyad axis of the complex. DNA sequence discrimination by CAP derives both from sequence-dependent distortion of the DNA helix and from direct hydrogen-bonding interactions between three protein side chains and the exposed edges of three base pairs in the major groove of the DNA. The structure of this transcription factor--DNA complex provides insights into possible mechanisms of transcription activation.\r"

The theory is regarded by many as a cornerstone of modern evolutionary thought, but there has been little direct empirical evidence supporting it. Some of its underlying assumptions are viewed as contradictory, and the existence and efficacy of the theory's fundamental adaptive process, interdemic selection, is the focus of controversy. Interdemic selection was imposed on large arrays of laboratory populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in the manner described by Wright: the differential dispersion of individuals from demes of high fitness into demes of low fitness. A significant increase in average fitness was observed in the experimental arrays when compared to control populations with equivalent but random migration rates. The response was not proportional to the selection differential: The largest response occurred with interdemic selection every two generations rather than every generation or every three generations. The results indicate that the interdemic phase of Wright's shifting balance theory can increase average fitness and suggest that gene interactions are involved in the observed response.\r"

An antibody generated against a derivative of 2-acetamido-1,5-napthalenedisulfonate efficiently catalyzes the decarboxylation of 5-nitro-3-carboxybenzisoxazole. This unimolecular reaction is not susceptible to general acid-base catalysis but is highly sensitive to microenvironment; thus, it provides a simple chemical model for biologically important decarboxylations. The 10(4)-fold rate acceleration observed for the antibody reflects the kinetic advantage of the low-dielectric environment of the binding pocket acting to destabilize the substrate by desolvation and to stabilize the charge-delocalized transition state through dispersion interactions. These results are pertinent to an understanding of solvent effects in enzymic reactions in general and suggest approaches for developing antibody catalysts for numerous other reactions that involve large changes in charge distribution as the reaction coordinate is traversed.\r"

During S phase, transcription of mammalian histone H2B genes requires a specific promoter element and its cognate transcription factor Oct1 (OTF1). A possible mechanism for regulating histone H2B transcription during the cell cycle is direct modulation of Oct1 activity by phase-specific posttranslational modifications. Analysis of Oct1 during progression through the cell cycle revealed a complex temporal program of phosphorylation. A p34cdc2-related protein kinase that is active during mitosis may be responsible for one mitotic phosphorylation of Oct1. However, the temporally controlled appearance of Oct1 phosphopeptides suggests the involvement of multiple kinases and phosphatases. These results support the idea that cell cycle-regulated transcription factors may be direct substrates for phase-specific regulatory enzymes.\r"

At 2 to 3 months of age, many of the mice developed chronic arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis.

A family of genes encoding subunits of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) type of glutamate receptor has been cloned. Some combinations of these subunits assemble into receptors with a substantial permeability to calcium, whereas others do not. To investigate the structural features that control ion permeation through these ligand-gated channels, mutant receptor subunits with single-amino acid changes were constructed. Mutation of a certain amino acid that results in a net charge change (from glutamine to arginine or vice versa) alters both the current-voltage relation and the calcium permeability of non-NMDA receptors. A site has thus been identified that regulates the permeation properties of these glutamate receptors.\r"

The protein HRR25 from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was defined by the mutation hrr25-1. This mutation resulted in sensitivity to continuous expression of the HO double-strand endonuclease, to methyl methanesulfonate, and to x-irradiation. Homozygotes of hrr25-1 were unable to sporulate and disruption and deletion of HRR25 interfered with mitotic and meiotic cell division. Sequence analysis revealed two distinctive regions in the protein. The NH2-terminus of HRR25 contains the hallmark features of protein kinases, whereas the COOH-terminus is rich in proline and glutamine. Mutations in HRR25 at conserved residues found in all protein kinases inactivated the gene, and these mutants exhibited the hrr25 null phenotypes. Taken together, the hrr25 mutant phenotypes and the features of the gene product indicate that HRR25 is a distinctive member of the protein kinase superfamily.\r"

The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints.\r"

The repair of such gaps resulted in the transfer of up to several kilobase pairs of information from a homologous template sequence to the site of P element excision by a process similar to gene conversion. The template was an in vitro-modified sequence that was tested at various genomic positions. Characterization of 123 conversion tracts provided a detailed description of their length and distribution. Most events were continuous conversion tracts that overlapped the P insertion site without concomitant conversion of the template. The average conversion tract was 1379 base pairs, and the distribution of tract lengths fit a simple model of gap enlargement. The conversion events occurred at sufficiently high frequencies to form the basis of an efficient means of directed gene replacement.\r"

This restenosis is due principally to the accumulation of neointimal smooth muscle cells, which is also a prominent feature of the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis. The factors responsible for the accumulation of intimal smooth muscle cells have not been identified. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent smooth muscle chemoattractant and mitogen. It is present in platelets and can be formed by endothelium, smooth muscle, and monocyte-derived macrophages. The development of an intimal lesion in the carotid artery of athymic nude rats induced by intraarterial balloon catheter deendothelialization was inhibited by a polyclonal antibody to PDGF. These data demonstrate that endogenous PDGF is involved in the accumulation of neointimal smooth muscle cells associated with balloon injury and may be involved in restenosis after angioplasty, and perhaps in atherogenesis as well.\r"

Currents induced by activation of the AMPA-kainate receptor were potentiated by agents that specifically stimulate adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity or were supported by intracellular application of the catalytic subunit of PKA by itself or in combination with cAMP. Furthermore, depression of these currents by a competitive inhibitor of PKA indicates that AMPA-kainate receptors are regulated by endogenous PKA. Endogenous protein phosphatases also regulate these receptors because an inhibitor of cellular phosphates enhanced kainate currents. Modulation of PKA and phosphatases may regulate the function of these receptors and thus contribute to synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons.\r"

Studies of glutamate receptor channels expressed in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons reveal that these channels are subject to neuromodulatory regulation through the adenylate cyclase cascade. The whole-cell current response to glutamate and kainate [a non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor agonist] was enhanced by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Single-channel analysis revealed that an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) increases the opening frequency and the mean open time of the non-NMDA-type glutamate receptor channels. Analysis of synaptic events indicated that forskolin, acting through PKA, increased the amplitude and decay time of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents.\r"

The R2R3 fragment was predicted to contain two consecutive helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs with unconventional turns.

Altering immunoregulatory pathways with lymphokines in vivo may provide a mechanism for controlling a variety of immunologic disorders. Although normally produced in vivo in very small quantities, the widespread availability of recombinant lymphokines has made it possible to study the molecular signals involved in production of lymphocyte effectors with activity against tumor. For example, interleukin-2-based cancer immunotherapy programs have, in certain clinical situations, suggested that immunologic intervention can influence the regression of metastatic cancer. Ultimately the successful application of these biologic agents requires an understanding of the interaction between the immune system and tumor on a molecular level. To induce a given biologic effect, it is necessary both to classify the required lymphokines and to identify the relevant effector cell populations. This review will examine the progress made in identifying the requirements for lymphokine-induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function.\r"

  ".W": "Our experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital malformation, has increased considerably in recent years and now includes 144 patients (65 male and 79 female patients). Hemangioma was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and hypertrophy of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%). In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity. Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only. Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in KTS is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial. To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity. In seven patients we removed varicose veins or resected hemangioma of the lower extremity. Although none was cured, all five who underwent resection of varicose veins and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a hemangioma improved. Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of varicose veins in another institution had worsening of the symptoms. In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein. Such operation in KTS has not been reported previously. The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation. Although patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of hemangioma may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications. Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or hypoplasia of the deep veins may be needed.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients (median age, 81 years) with primary hyperparathyroidism were treated with intravenous infusions of disodium pamidronate (APD), which is a bisphosphonate drug. Six patients had severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium concentration, greater than 3 mmol/L) persisting after rehydration with saline and treatment with furosemide; three patients had moderate hypercalcemia with pronounced symptoms (serum calcium concentration 2.8 to 2.9 mmol/L). Three of the patients were considered to have hypercalcemic crises. In all patients, the raised serum calcium levels were lowered by the disodium pamidronate infusions. One week after a single infusion of 15 to 60 mg disodium pamidronate, six of the nine patients had serum calcium concentrations within the normal reference interval and two patients had slightly raised values. Transient asymptomatic hypocalcemia was noted in one patient. All patients tolerated the infusions well, and no side effects were noted. In the patients with verified parathyroid adenomas, a temporary increase in parathyroid hormone levels were observed concomitant with the drop in serum calcium level. The patient with parathyroid cancer displayed no such effect indicating an autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid carcinoma tumor. The good effect of treatment with the osteoclast inhibitor disodium pamidronate on hypercalcemia caused by primary hyperparathyroidism suggests that this hypercalcemia is mainly due to an increased osteoclast activity. The number of patients in this series is yet too small to allow general conclusions. But the case histories in this series show that disodium pamidronate promises to be of value in different clinical situations for the treatment of severe hypercalcemia in patients with hyperparathyroidism. It can be used (1) preoperatively to investigate whether the patient's symptoms are related to the hypercalcemia, (2) in the treatment of hypercalcemic crises when \"forced diuresis\" has failed to normalize the serum calcium, (3) after unsuccessful parathyroid surgery when it can be used as a long-term treatment before reoperation, giving time for localization studies and healing of the scar reaction, and (4) in aged and fragile patients where it can be tried as an alternative to surgery.\r"

The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%. Age did not correlate with morbidity. It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age. As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group). Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points. The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Iliofemoral venous thrombosis treated by anticoagulants alone almost invariably results in postthrombotic sequelae with deep venous reflux alone or combined with an outflow obstruction. This study evaluates the result of iliofemoral venous thrombectomy with temporary proximal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) performed on 48 consecutive patients. In 10 patients the thrombus extended in the inferior vena cava, and the thrombectomy was combined with inferior vena cava interruption. The AVF closed spontaneously in 8 of 48 patients (patency rate, 84%). An attempt to close the AVF by placing a detachable balloon percutaneously under radiographic control was made 6 to 12 weeks later (success rate, 87%; complications, rare). A preclosure arteriovenography of the femoro-iliaco-caval segment revealed 34 of 38 segments open (patency rate, 89%). Four patients had severe stenosis of the iliac segment, and a transvenous percutaneous dilatation was successfully performed in three of the four patients, keeping the fistula. At AVF closure 4 weeks later the arteriovenography showed sustained dilatation in only two patients. Thirty-seven patients were followed for 3 to 48 months (median, 24 months) and 30 of 37 patients (81%) who had no symptoms were not using compression stockings. Doppler investigation revealed patent and competent femoral and popliteal veins and normal photoplethysmography in 56% of the patients. Four iliac veins were occluded (patency rate, 88%). No recurrence of fistula had occurred. Venous iliofemoral thrombectomy seems to better preserve valve function. The percutaneous balloon closure of the AVF has decreased the complication rate, facilitated venographic evaluation of the result, and made possible the performance of percutaneous interventions under the protection of the AVF.\r"

We compared the effects of bolus and continuous interleukin-2 infusion on pulmonary (QL) and systemic microvascular fluid filtration in 11 adult sheep prepared with chronic lung and soft-tissue lymph fistulas. Interleukin-2 was administered as a bolus infusion (100,000 units/kg) every 8 hours for 3 days or as a continuous infusion at the same dose for 3 days. No significant changes in pulmonary hydrostatic pressures or pulmonary vascular resistance were noted after either bolus or continuous interleukin-2 infusion. However, significantly decreased (p less than or equal to 0.05) systemic vascular resistances were observed in both groups. QL increased steadily throughout the infusion period in both groups, peaking at three times baseline on the third infusion day. The plasma/interstitial protein clearance (QL X lymph/plasma protein ratio) rose similarly in both groups, indicating increased barrier permeability. Increased lymphocyte clearance into lung lymph occurred by day 3 but was not associated with lymphocytic sequestration in the lung interstitium. We conclude that pulmonary and systemic microvascular fluid and protein flux exhibit similar changes after bolus or continuous interleukin-2 infusion. These changes are associated with increased clearance of lymphocytes into lung lymph that are not sequestered in the pulmonary interstitium after infusions of shorter duration.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-bearing rats submitted to hypovolemia have higher mortality rates than have non-tumor-bearing control rats. To determine the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity to hemorrhage, we studied Fischer-344 rats with subcutaneous methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma (tumor burden, 10% body weight) to determine hematologic and blood volume alterations. Subsequently we used the same animal model in an unanesthetized condition to determine the sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation, as well as vascular responsiveness to vasoactive agents. The rats were separated into two groups: control and tumor-bearing rats (TBR). Sensitivity to hemorrhage and resuscitation was determined by bleeding the conscious rats (15 ml/kg) and resuscitating them with 0.9% NaCl (45 ml/kg). Vascular responsiveness was determined after injection of varying doses of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin, with continuous measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rate of increase of MAP, maximum MAP, relative increase in MAP (maximum minus baseline), rate of recovery toward baseline MAP, and duration of the response were determined. There was a significant anemia in TBR, but blood volume was similar in both groups. Baseline MAP was significantly higher in control rats (125.3 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) compared with TBR (107.5 +/- 6.0 mm Hg). After hemorrhage, MAP in TBR reached significantly lower levels than in control rats. In addition, after saline resuscitation, MAP in TBR did not return to baseline levels, whereas MAP in control rats returned to prehemorrhage MAP. With nitroglycerin, MAP decreased to lower levels in TBR than in control rats. With phenylephrine, the maximum MAP reached was significantly higher, and the response to phenylephrine was maintained for a significantly longer period in control rats compared with TBR. We conclude that TBR are more sensitive to hypovolemic events in association with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, profound hypotension, and altered overall vascular responsiveness to sympathetic stimuli.\r"

Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (n = 27) underwent a 30-minute interval of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure = 55 mm Hg) during which inflation of a subdural balloon maintained ICP at 15 mm Hg. After shock, animals were resuscitated with one of four randomly assigned fluids: (1) slightly hypotonic crystalloid (Na+, 125 mEq.L-1; designated Na-125); (2) hypertonic crystalloid (Na+, 250 mEq.L-1; designated Na-250); (3) slightly hypotonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-125P); or (4) hypertonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-250P). Supplemental fluid was administered as needed to maintain cardiac output comparable to baseline values. ICP increased progressively in all fluid groups during resuscitation. Cerebral blood flow, measured by the cerebral venous outflow method, increased immediately after resuscitation and then declined steadily over time in all groups. Fluids containing pentastarch maintained hemodynamic stability with minimal supplementation throughout most of the postresuscitation period, compared with crystalloid alone, which required substantial additional volume. If decreased intracranial compliance and hemorrhage are combined, ongoing resuscitation is associated with significantly increased ICP and significantly decreased cerebral blood flow, independent of the tonicity and oncotic pressure of the infused fluid.\r"

The veins were harvested 15 to 17 months later. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was determined by measuring tension of deendothelialized coronary arteries mounted on a tensiometer and superfused with the effluent of the vein grafts. These grafts were perfused with acetylcholine and calcium ionophore A23187, which cause case vascular smooth muscle relaxation by means of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor production. Control arteries and veins were obtained from other dogs for comparison. In response to acetylcholine from 10(-9) to 10(-4) mol/L, the final cumulative relaxation produced in the detector coronary artery (mean +/- SD) was 64.2% +/- 25.7% by the control arteries, 14.2% +/- 5.5% by the vein bypass graft, and 5.3% +/- 5.6% by the control veins. In response to A23187 from 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L, the final cumulative relaxation was 66.2% +/- 19.0% by the control arteries, 30.6% +/- 8.9% by the vein bypass grafts, and 5.3% +/- 5.6% by the control veins. The differences were significant between the vein bypass grafts and the control arteries (p less than 0.04 for acetylcholine; p less than 0.04 for A23187) and the control veins (p less than 0.03 for acetylcholine; p less than 0.02 for A23187). Perfusion of saphenous veins used as chronic arterial bypass grafts with either acetylcholine or A23187 produced detector vessel relaxation, consistent with endothelium-dependent relaxing factor production. The magnitude of the relaxation response did not approach that from perfusion of control arteries.\r"

Sixteen anesthetized Yorkshire swine underwent splenectomy and stainless steel wire placement in the infrarenal aorta and were instrumented with pulmonary artery and carotid artery catheters. The wire was pulled, producing a 5 mm aortotomy and spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The animals had been alternately assigned to either an untreated control group (n = 8) or a treatment group (n = 8), which received 80 ml/kg lactated Ringer's solution intravenously. The volume of hemorrhage and the mortality rate were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in the treatment group receiving lactated Ringer's solution relative to the control animals (2142 +/- 178 ml versus 783 +/- 85 ml, and eight of eight animals versus zero of eight animals, respectively). From these data we conclude that, in this model of uncontrolled arterial hemorrhage resulting from abdominal aortotomy, rapidly administering lactated Ringer's solution intravenously significantly increases hemorrhage and death.\r"

Ischemia of the liver for 90 or 120 minutes did not permit survival of the animals. XO represented 15% of the total xanthine dehydrogenase plus XO activity in the control liver. XO activity remained unchanged even after 90 minutes of hepatic ischemia, although a marked increase in lipid peroxide in the liver tissue was observed during the reperfusion. When hepatic ischemia was prolonged for 6 hours (animals were dead), XO activity rose to 35% of the total activity. Incubation of the liver at 37 degrees C resulted in a definite change in XO activity dependent on the length of incubation period. Although no significant changes occurred in XO activity during the first 2 hours of incubation, a marked XO conversion was observed between 2 and 4 hours, and a maximal conversion was achieved after 6 hours of incubation. These results suggest that XO newly generated during ischemia has a very limited role in oxygen free radical production after resuming perfusion.\r"

In an attempt to increase intestinal length, the ileal conduit was replaced by a colon conduit and the ileum was placed back in continuity with the intestinal tract. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and her chronic diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic derangements resolved.

Most reports are anecdotal, and hospital records list the incidence of diagnosis as 0.001% of admissions. Diagnosis of chylous ascites is usually not difficult, inasmuch as aspiration and chemical analysis of the fluid yield the answer. Visualization of retroperitoneal fluid collection by computerized tomography or ultrasonography, however, does always raise the possibility of recurrence of tumor in cases where the primary operation was for cancer. Treatment of smaller lesions can be expectant. Respiratory exercises causing an increase in negative intrathoracic pressure may aid in the movement of fluid through the lymphatics. For larger collections, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition are also often enough, but surgery is sometimes required. Simple insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt, as in this patient, can be as effective as major operations such as identification and ligation of the offending lymphatic or marsupialization of the cyst.\r"

In distinguishing between organ-confined and extracapsular disease with a preoperative serum PSA of 10 ng/mL as a cutoff value, the sensitivity was 68 percent, the specificity was 66 percent, the positive predictive value was 46 percent, and the negative predictive value was 83 percent. Although there was a trend of increasing preoperative serum PSA levels with higher pathologic stage or grade, there was no significant difference in preoperative serum PSA values with pathologic stage and/or grade considered as a group or in determining stage and/or grade preoperatively on an individual basis.\r"

Forty-five patients (42%) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes prior to beginning radiotherapy. Sixty-one patients (57%) were diagnosed by needle biopsy. TURP and needle biopsy groups were comparable (age, elevated acid phosphatase, early [A2, B] and late [C, D1] disease stages, and follow-up). TURP patients were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors and were more often given concurrent hormonal therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analyses to study the effect of TURP on patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy were done. We were unable to demonstrate any adverse impact of TURP on the outcome of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This issue remains controversial and should be addressed in a prospective, randomized trial.\r"

Both groups were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether or not the incidences of microinvasion of capsule and of extraprostatic disease differed. Review of the apical and lateral margins of the specimens revealed no statistically significant difference in either the degree of microinvasion of capsule or the incidence of extraprostatic disease between the groups.\r"

The patients were divided into four groups: one with no risk factors, one with one vascular risk factor, one with two vascular risk factors, and one with all three risk factors. The results of penile vascular evaluation in these patient groups were compared. The incidence of penile vascular impairment was found to be higher in patients with one vascular risk factor than in those with none. The proportion of abnormal penile vascular findings significantly increased as the number of risk factors increased. These data confirm the important role of vascular risk factors, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, in the pathogenesis of organic impotence.\r"

Appropriate utilization of the examination requires its use in high-risk groups with equivocal physical findings or in patients with unusual presentations of age, anatomy, or neurologic deficit. The scan if used for routine screening of the acute scrotum would result in needless delays and unjustifiable expense when it is mandatory that the treatment be immediate surgical exploration.\r"

Four patients had evidence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases on both CT and LAG.

No patient had positive findings on CT with negative LAG. In addition to aiding in staging, LAG is very useful in designing radiation treatment portals.

One hundred thirty-one of these patients were followed up; the results continue to show a higher percentage of initial complete remissions with BCG (68%) than with ADR (57%). With additional therapy, both BCG and ADR achieved complete remission in 83 percent of the patients. When 7 failures with patients taking ADR were switched to BCG and the disease cleared, the rate of complete remission for BCG rose to 85 percent. The recurrence rate per 100 patient-months was only slightly different for BCG (0.9) and ADR (0.8). The percentage of progressions continued to be higher for BCG (8%) than for ADR (5%). Cystectomies were performed in 2.5 percent of the BCG patients. Using the Cox regression model with covariates, we found drug treatment, tumor grade, and sex to be statistically significant in determining failures throughout the protocol. Although both BCG and ADR were effective over the course of the study, BCG is the drug of choice for residual tumor (Stages T1 and Tis).\r"

The authors identified eight such cases (seven patients from Japan and one from the United States) of undifferentiated gastric carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma [LELC]) and examined them for Epstein-Barr (EBV) viral sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. EBV was detected in seven of the eight cases by PCR, including a lymph-node metastasis. ISH that was performed in six of these cases showed EBV genomes to be uniformly present in the carcinoma cells and not present in the reactive lymphoid infiltrate or normal gastric mucosa. PCR of a polymorphic EBV locus (lymphocyte-determined membrane antigen) showed that a single genotype was present in each gastric LELC, consistent with a clonal process. These findings suggest that some undifferentiated gastric carcinomas are EBV-related and that focal EBV infection occurs before transformation.\r"

In this study, the authors demonstrate coexpression of the B-cell marker, CD20, and the granulocyte associated antigen, CD15, by Reed-Sternberg cells in three of 20 cases of nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease using a double-labelling technique in one case and staining of serial sections in three cases. Additionally, the authors found that expression of CD20 occurred more often in tumors with a monomorphous proliferation of mononuclear and binucleate Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells, without numerous eosinophils or polymorphonuclear neutrophils. In contrast, expression of CD15 by Reed-Sternberg cells was associated with a greater granulocyte infiltrate. The presence or absence of fibrosis, plasma cells, and histiocytes did not correlate with antigen expression. These results suggest that there may be a continuum of antigen expression by Reed-Sternberg cells, with some cells expressing CD20, some CD15, and others expressing both antigens; cells coexpressing both CD15 and CD20 may represent an unstable intermediate in the process of antigen switching. The possibility that antigen expression by the neoplastic cells in a given case may modulate depending on the background infiltrate could explain the heterogeneity of immunophenotype among cases of Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "A distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of dystrophic neurites that immunoreact with antibodies to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ubiquitin (Ub). The authors examined dystrophic axons (DA) present in other chronic conditions such as familial infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), aging, cystic fibrosis, and biliary obstruction as well as in conditions of shorter duration such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leucoencephalopathy, infarction and radiation therapy to determine whether APP and Ub immunoreactivity was unique to the DA of AD. A large number of DA immunoreacted with antibodies to the A4, C- and N-terminal regions of APP as well as to Ub. Ub and APP immunoreactivities often, but not always, colocalized. \"Acute\" DA generally reacted more intensely and in larger number with antibodies to APP than to Ub, whereas the reverse was true for \"chronic\" DA. Structureless DA immunostained diffusely. In DA with cores or granules, the Ub immunoreaction was occasionally limited to these structures, whereas reaction with antibodies to APP was more diffuse. In view of the contention that impairment of proteolysis is the common pathogenetic step in the formation of DA, Ub immunoreactivity in all DA may indicate a vicarious attempt to degrade accumulated components through an activation of the Ub system. The role of APP in the formation of DA remains to be determined.\r"

Most tumors (91%) had patterns (phenotypes) that could not be classified by Dunn's standard nomenclature. The nonstandard tumors were described as eosinophilic small cell (SC), basophilic large cell (LC), or pale intermediate cell (IC). The SC tumor was associated with ras, the LC was associated with myc, and the IC was associated with neu, with specificities more than .90 and sensitivities ranging from .99 to .48. Thus, the tumor phenotype could be used to predict which oncogene was present in the animal. The presence of myc in combination with either ras or neu resulted in the predominance of LC tumors and accelerated tumorigenesis. The combination of ras and neu resulted in a decreased tumor incidence. Thus, knowledge of the oncogenes that were present could be used to predict the natural history of the disease.\r"

Immunotyping of tissue-cell suspensions was done by three-color flow cytometry, which was complemented by immunocytology by using cytocentrifuged preparations. Two activated T-cell subsets were studied: acutely activated TIL-T (CD3+ CD25+ HLADr-) and chronically activated TIL-T (CD3+ CD25- HLADr+). Results showed an association of the more aggressive intermediate/high-grade B-cell NHL with a higher percentage of late-phase activated TIL-T and a progressive increase with the grade of malignancy: 10.29%, 23.25%, 33.87%, and 47.78% (means) for BLH and for low-, intermediate- and high-grade B-cell NHL, respectively. Differences for this subset were significant (P less than 0.050) for the following comparisons: hyperplasia versus intermediate-grade NHL (P less than 0.0012), hyperplasia versus high-grade NHL (P less than 0.0002), and low versus high-grade NHL (P less than 0.0080). The percentage of acutely activated TIL-T cells did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups. The results suggest a host T-cell response to proliferating neoplastic cells in B-cell NHL. Paradoxically, the response does not appear to be protective for the host since the intensity is directly proportional to the grade of malignancy. However, the recognition of this response may have clinical applications since its amplification with biological response modifiers may result in effective adoptive immunotherapy of B-cell NHL. Further clarification of the specificity and biologic significance of host T-cell activation in B-cell NHL will require functional studies of isolated lymphocytic subpopulations from neoplastic tissue.\r"

To investigate possible arthritogenic activity of serum of these mice, intraarticular injections of the serum components to knee joints of nonarthritic MRL/Mp mice not bearing the lpr gene (MRL/Mp(-)+/+) were performed. Two fractions from the serum were obtained by a gel chromatography. The void fraction (VF), but not the nonvoid fraction (NVF), induced acute inflammatory lesions in the joints by single injection, and destructive arthritis by repeated injections. VF had immune complex activity, and contained a large amount of cryoglobulin, which in itself was found arthritogenic. These findings indicate that the serum components of MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice have a potency to cause destructive arthritis. These results are direct evidence in a syngeneic animal model system, which suggests the pathogenic significance of serum components in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

A panel of antibodies directed against synthetic peptides, which correspond to distinct domains of this putative APP molecule (i.e., amino acid residues 45-62, 587-596, 597-606, 597-638 [beta/A4 peptide], 638-658 and 653-661), were used to probe immunohistochemically serial sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains for the presence of APP and/or its derivatives. Histochemical staining of adjacent sections with Bielschowsky's silver impregnation and with Congo red or thioflavin S-staining techniques was also done to identify the structures with amyloid deposition. All these antibodies exhibited intense immunoreactivity with amyloidotic cerebral vessels, including meningeal and parenchymal. This observation indicates that the amyloidotic vasculature of AD brain contains, in addition to the fibril-forming beta/A4 protein, nonamyloidogenic APP and/or its derivatives. More importantly, this APP immunoreactivity colocalized with angiopathic amyloid, which is characterized by phenol-resistant, birefringent congophilia. Parallel analyses with a dual SABC/silver impregnation procedure further confirmed that APP and/or its derivatives, including the amyloidogenic beta/A4, colocalized with argentophilic amyloid in the cerebrovasculature of AD.\r"

The authors determined whether oval cells proliferate and if small hepatocytes might be generated from epithelial cell progenitors in noncarcinogenic liver injury. The authors found that oval cells similar to those detected in early carcinogenesis proliferate in response to D-galactosamine (GaIN). Oval cells expressed gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, bile duct-type cytokeratins and peanut agglutinin binding. Two unusual types of hepatocytes also appeared after injury: small hepatocytes (less than or equal to 16 microns in diameter) and hepatocytes lining atypical ductlike structures. In situ hybridization studies showed that the fetal form of alphafetoprotein mRNA was expressed by many oval cells, some bile duct cells, and occasional hepatocytes. By following the fate of epithelial cells labeled early after GaIN administration, the authors conclude that duct cells can generate both oval cells and small hepatocytes in response to GaIN.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relationship between null cell adenomas, oncocytomas and gonadotroph adenomas, we analyzed 32 surgically removed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pituitary tumors for the expression of pituitary hormone messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by in situ hybridization (ISH). Most tumors were also analyzed for chromogranin A mRNA. To identify the cell type constituting the tumors and to assess hormone content, all tumors were investigated by histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Most null cell adenomas (6/11) and gonadotroph adenomas (9/10) expressed the mRNAs for alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones whereas only 2/11 oncocytomas expressed alpha-subunit mRNA. FSH beta and/or LH beta mRNA were present in most null cell and gonadotroph adenomas but only in a few oncocytomas. Prolactin (PRL) mRNA was detected in two null cell tumors and in one gonadotroph adenoma, whereas GH and POMC mRNA were present in one null cell adenoma. Chromogranin A mRNA, which codes for the major secretory granule protein, was present in 25/26 tumors including all tumors that were negative for pituitary hormone mRNAs, indicating adequate preservation of specific mRNA transcripts in the paraffin-embedded sections of tumor cells. These results indicate that null cell adenomas and gonadotroph adenomas are closely related neoplasms and that oncocytomas may represent a functionally defective form of null cell adenoma characterized by mitochondrial abundance, which has retained the capacity to synthesize the major secretory granule protein chromogranin A. Although the cytogenesis of null cell adenomas and oncocytomas is not clear, it can be suggested that these two tumor types are derived from a pluripotential precursor cell that is capable of undergoing multidirectional differentiation and synthesizing various hormones, mainly glycoproteins.\r"

Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite.\r"

To further investigate the relationship of smoke exposure and generation of active oxygen species, the authors exposed rat tracheal explants to varying amounts of smoke for 10 minutes in a humidified chamber. After smoke exposure was completed, tracheal segments were incubated in a modification of the ultrastructural cerium chloride technique that was devised by Briggs et al. to demonstrate hydrogen peroxide production. Smoke dose-dependent deposition of cerium-containing reaction product was found on the cilia and the apical membranes; with low-dose smoke, the reaction product appeared as individual dots along the apical surface, but with greater amounts of smoke, heavy linear deposits of reaction product were found along the apical membranes. Smoke produced focal dose-related cell damage with blebbing of the apical membranes, loss of cilia, and focal cell necrosis. Catalase prevented both the positive histochemical reaction and the cell damage; if the catalase was first boiled, its protective effect was destroyed. Similarly, after smoke exposure was completed, tracheal segments were covered with a solution of nitroblue tetrazolium to demonstrate production of superoxide anion. A positive reaction was observed by light microscopy on the surface of tracheas that was exposed to smoke but not that exposed to air; the reaction could be prevented by addition of superoxide dismutase. The authors conclude that exposure of tracheal explants to cigarette smoke in vitro is associated with histochemical evidence of continuing production of both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion at the apical cell membrane.\r"

Intimal thickening in this model was most pronounced in the anastomotic regions, and was composed principally of vascular smooth muscle cells, as identified by immunocytochemistry with anti-muscle actin antibody, HHF-35. Medial thickening was less cellular, and evenly distributed throughout the grafts. Continuous, intravenous infusion of whole heparin at 0.3 mg/kg/hr effectively inhibited the development of myointimal proliferative lesions, although with no effect on medial thickening. The authors suggest that heparin, through its antiproliferative activity for vascular smooth muscle cells, may have a potentially important pharmacologic role in preventing vein graft failure, which most commonly results from the development of myointimal proliferative lesions.\r"

The sequence of events leading to the accumulation of amyloid precursors in senile plaques is unknown. In previous studies, the authors have shown that congophilic deposits in a subset of mature amyloid plaques are angiocentric. In this study, the authors used image analysis microspectroscopy and an antibody directed against a synthetic beta-protein (beta) or A4 sequence to examine the distribution patterns of this protein in serial sections from brains of patients with AD and in normal aged brains after quantitative immunohistochemistry. Image analysis of early primitive plaques disclosed two main patterns of early beta/A4 deposition, which consisted of neurocentric and angiocentric decreasing concentration gradients. In most instances, these gradients were not recognizable by the naked eye but appeared strikingly conspicuous after image subtraction and pseudocoloring. The described neurocentric gradients suggest that deposition of this protein, in at least some early primitive plaques, is related to neurons and possibly originates from these cells. The opposite viewpoint, i.e., that peripherally synthesized beta/A4 protein would 'sink in' toward neurons, is not supported because in very early plaques the highest immunoreactivity within the gradient was the neuronal body itself. A hypothesis is offered to reconcile the presence of both neurocentric and angiocentric depositions of these substances.\r"

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) inoculated with SIV often develop a giant cell encephalitis similar to that seen in humans infected with HIV. The authors examined SIV expression by immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization in the cerebrum, cerebellum, choroid plexus, and spinal cord from five macaques with and two macaques without giant cell encephalitis. Selected portions of the central nervous system (CNS) also were examined by electron microscopy. Simian immunodeficiency virus was detected in the CNS of all seven monkeys whether or not they had giant cell encephalitis. Both SIV antigen and RNA were present in all levels of the CNS examined. Macrophage/giant cell lesions always contained viral RNA and antigen and were the only sites where viral particles were detected by electron microscopy. However, SIV antigen and RNA also were commonly associated with small vessels, the choroid plexus, and meninges; these were the only locations where virus was detected in animals without giant cell encephalitis. Immunophenotyping showed that the cellular infiltrates consisted primarily of monocyte/macrophages and occasional CD8-positive T cells. Macrophages and T cells also were present in the stroma of the choroid plexus and were intimately associated with vessels in the CNS of SIV-infected but not uninfected macaques. Simian immunodeficiency virus infection of the macaque CNS provides an excellent model for studying the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of HIV-1-encephalitis.\r"

The authors have therefore carried out an immunocytochemical study at the light microscopic and ultrastructural level to determine the intracellular localization of alpha 1-antitrypsin. Double labeling with colloidal gold showed that alpha 1-antitrypsin is localized at the same site as neutrophil elastase, i.e., within primary granules. Secondary granules (detected by labeling for lactoferrin) were unstained for alpha 1-antitrypsin. Elastase and its major inhibitor therefore coexist within the same granule population within human neutrophils. Some difference in their intraorganelle distribution existed at the ultrastructural level (in that elastase tended to be localized at the periphery of the granules whereas alpha 1-antitrypsin was usually diffusely present in the matrix of the granules), but further studies are required to determine whether the two molecules are already complexed with each other within the neutrophil.\r"

The transcripts for smooth muscle actins were significantly reduced and there were less alpha-actin filaments detected by immunofluorescence. Cytochemical staining disclosed a large accumulation of lipid droplets in the transformed cells incubated with rabbit hypercholesterolemic beta-very-low-density lipoprotein. Chemical analysis showed that cholesteryl esters were significantly elevated in these cells. Phenotypic changes induced in human vascular smooth muscle cells by SV40 early genes are similar to those found in smooth muscle cells from atherosclerotic lesions and may indicate common pathogenetic mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial smooth muscle cells produce large amounts of extracellular matrix molecules during repair processes and in primary culture. This occurs after a transition of the cells from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype and together with the acquisition of proliferative capacity. Here, the deposition of the glycoprotein tenascin in the extracellular matrix of rat arterial smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Tenascin was found in the intimal layer of the adult rat aorta and carotid artery, but not in the media. Tenascin also appeared in the neointima formed by proliferating smooth muscle cells 2 weeks after balloon catheter injury of the carotid artery. To determine if the deposition of tenascin in the neointima after arterial injury was related to changes in smooth muscle function, freshly isolated rat aortic smooth muscle cells were seeded on a substrate of plasma fibronectin and allowed to modulate from a contractile to a synthetic state in a serum-free medium. In these quiescent cultures, a tenascin-containing extracellular matrix was formed after 3 to 4 days. Taken together, the results show that tenascin production is induced concomitantly with changes in smooth muscle phenotype both in vivo and in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Examination of the op/op mouse disclosed marked reduction and abnormal differentiation of osteoclasts in the bones and of tissue-specific macrophages in various visceral organs and tissues. Most of these macrophages were immature as judged by ultrastructural criteria. In co-cultures of normal mouse bone marrow cells with fibroblast cell lines prepared from the lungs of the op/op mice, a defective differentiation of monocytes into macrophages was confirmed, supporting previous evidence that the fibroblast cell lines of the mutant mouse failed to produce functional macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF-1). In such co-cultures, however, a small number of macrophages apparently mature under the influence of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by the op/op fibroblast cell lines. In the mutant mice, the numbers of macrophages in the uterine wall and ovaries were severely reduced. Compared with the tissues of normal littermates, those of the mutants contained about 60% fewer macrophages in many tissues. This suggests that an M-CSF-independent population of macrophages is derived from granulocyte/macrophage-colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) or earlier hematopoietic progenitors.\r"

  ".U": "91361971\r", 
  ".W": "Syrian hamsters were treated with ethinylestradiol and maintained on a diet containing alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha NF), a regimen that produces a high incidence of liver tumors. Morphologic analyses (light microscopy, immunoperoxidase studies, and electron microscopy) were performed on livers of these animals. After 4 months of hormone plus alpha NF treatment, marked hepatocyte cell changes were already present, as demonstrated by loss of eosinophilic staining of hepatocyte cytoplasm. Large multinucleated hepatocytes exhibiting frequent mitoses were observed around central veins. After 5 months of treatment, there was proliferation of bile ducts, and small cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling hepatocytes appeared surrounding these bile ducts. At 7 to 8 months, the first tumor nodules (foci) were seen. Tumor foci in the portal area consisted of small clusters of large cells resembling hepatocytes with irregular nuclei. At the same time, dysplastic glands were identified among proliferating bile ducts. By 8 to 10 months, large tumors were present. These were trabecular hepatocellular carcinomas with widely varying individual cell morphology. Compared with adjacent liver, dysplastic glands in the portal areas, microcarcinomas, and large tumors all showed intense immunostaining for cytokeratin. Rats treated with the same regimen also developed hepatic tumors, but the light and electron microscopy results and immunohistochemical profiles were very different. Altered hepatic foci composed of small hepatocytes were typically prominent; however, malignant tumors did not arise from the portal area. Neither altered foci nor tumors stained significantly for cytokeratin. These data suggest that the biochemical events giving rise to these liver tumors differ between the species studied, despite the animals being exposed to the same treatment regimens.\r"

This characteristic suggests that it should provide both a fast induction of anaesthesia and a rapid recovery from anaesthesia. To assess this, 60 patients were entered into a study and allocated at random to one of four groups receiving either desflurane or propofol for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Desflurane caused loss of consciousness in approximately 2 minutes during gaseous inductions. The psychomotor scores in the patients who received propofol for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia were significantly worse compared with those who were given desflurane for either induction and maintenance or for maintenance only. There was also a tendency for other recovery parameters to be faster in the patients receiving desflurane although this did not reach statistical significance. This suggests that desflurane would be a suitable agent for day case anaesthesia providing for a rapid recovery.\r"

Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting. No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis.\r"

One minute after administration of the reversal agents, there was a significantly greater reduction in barrier pressures in the neostigmine and atropine group than in the edrophonium and atropine group, but subsequently, there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Neither dose of clonidine completely abolished the increase in either heart rate or blood pressure. There was no difference in attenuation between the clonidine treatments; this indicated that the lower dose may be the more appropriate.\r"

The catecholamine infusion was started after induction of anaesthesia and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Patients in the dopexamine group had less evidence of renal impairment and failure than those in the dopamine group during 7 days after the operation, although the differences between groups did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly there were no significant differences between the two groups in peri-operative urine output, urine/plasma osmolality ratio or creatine clearance. Dopexamine is at least as effective as dopamine for renal protection in patients who undergo liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Harold King was an analytical chemist of distinction, who worked with Sir Henry Dale and his colleagues in the Medical Research Institute, later the Medical Research Council. He helped to quash the theory that the anaesthetic action of ether was attributable to its impurities. Interest in alkaloids led to the elucidation of the structure of hyoscine, the synthesis of muscarine and the first isolation of crystalline tubocurarine for which he proposed a structural formula, work which influenced Bovet in the synthesis of gallamine. He proposed the synthesis of the homologous series of methonium compounds which included relaxant and hypotensive drugs. His collaboration with Rosenheim was outstanding and opened the way for synthesis of cholesterol and the steroids. He was always encouraging clinicians, and gave a sample of tubocurarine to Ranyard West who was the first to inject d-tubocurarine into a human patient.\r"

The 60 patients studied received a standardised general anaesthetic and were randomly allocated to one of two groups immediately before tracheal intubation. The mean nasal intubation time (33.2 seconds) was significantly greater than mean oral intubation time (14.8 seconds). The mean arterial pressure changes in the nasal group were significantly greater and more prolonged than in the oral group. The mean heart rate in the nasal group was significantly lower than in the oral group during the first minute after intubation, after which heart rates were similar. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to arterial oxygen saturation levels at any stage.\r"

  ".W": "Increases in plasma concentrations of platelet granule products such as platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin during cardiopulmonary bypass suggest that platelets are activated during extracorporeal circulation. Subsequent circulation of these activated platelets may be responsible for the ubiquitous platelet dysfunction associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Using flow cytometry and a monoclonal antibody directed against an alpha-granule membrane protein, granule membrane protein 140 (GMP-140), which is expressed on the platelet surface membrane after activation, we directly measured the percentage of circulating activated platelets in 41 patients before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, we compared the GMP-140 expression with platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Cardiopulmonary bypass produced a significant increase in the percentage of GMP-140-positive platelets persisting in the circulation; the percentage peaked at a mean of 29% (range 10-58%) before separation from extracorporeal circulation. A significant percentage of these activated platelets continued to circulate in the early postoperative period. Simultaneous measurement of platelet aggregation in response to ADP demonstrated an aggregation defect that had a time course distinct from platelet activation and whose magnitude did not correlate with the degree of platelet activation in individual patients. We conclude that cardiopulmonary bypass causes a complex constellation of platelet defects, which include alpha-granule release, prolonged circulation of activated, \"spent\" platelets, and impaired platelet aggregation.\r"

  ".W": "Laboratory testing of presurgical patients has been shown to be excessive, thereby increasing costs, reducing resources for other health care uses, and increasing risks to both patients and physicians. As one step toward reducing the number of unnecessary preoperative tests ordered, we used an automated method to aid preoperative assessment of 239 patients in Chicago and in Winnipeg. The \"HealthQuiz,\" a small hand-held device containing a computer chip and video screen, uses a decision tree to ask a minimum of 60 health-related questions (the patient's response to certain questions determines the number of questions presented). The device then generates a summary printout of patient answers, the health areas needing further attention, and the laboratory tests most likely to uncover clinically important abnormalities in that patient. HealthQuiz responses are intended to aid the physician and not to replace the personal interview. As an aid, the automated interview highlights possible problem areas for in-depth pursuit by the physician. The need for nonselective batteries of tests is eliminated because recommendations for tests are based on specific elements of a patient's history. To be effective, responses to the HealthQuiz should be the same as responses to similar questions asked by a physician. We tested that premise in this study. Patient's answers to the HealthQuiz were compared with their responses to a randomly selected set of the same questions in a personal interview. Ninety-seven percent of the response pairs were identical, and most of the 3% that differed involved changes from \"not sure\" replies to the HealthQuiz. Laboratory tests suggested by responses to the two methods of questioning did not differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although the effect of systemic opioids on somatosensory evoked potentials has been well described, little is known about the interaction between intrathecally administered opioid analgesics and somatosensory evoked potentials. Accordingly, the influence of intrathecally administered morphine on posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTSCEPs) was investigated in 22 unpremedicated, awake, neurologically normal patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal or pelvic procedures. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either preservation-free intrathecal morphine sulfate (ITMS) or placebo. After baseline PTSCEP, heart rate and, mean blood pressure were recorded, ITMS (15 micrograms.kg-1) was injected via standard dural puncture with the patient in the lateral position. PTSCEPs, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were recorded again at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Control patients were treated identically (including position, sterile preparation, and subcutaneous tissue infiltration with local anesthetic), except for lumbar puncture, and were unaware of their randomization. Before administration of ITMS, PTSCEP P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 latencies were 39.4 +/- 3.2, 47.6 +/- 3.9, 59.2 +/- 3.2, 70.4 +/- 3.7, and 84.6 +/- 5.5 ms, (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. The corresponding P1-N1, N1-P2, and P2-N2 amplitudes were 2.4 +/- 1.1, 2.4 +/- 1.1, and 2.3 +/- 0.9 microV, respectively. There were no significant changes over time between the control and ITMS groups. PTSCEPs resulting from left-sided stimulation were not different from those elicited by right-sided stimulation. All ITMS patients had intense postoperative analgesia for at least 24 h. It is concluded that ITMS does not affect PTSCEP waveforms in the 35-90 ms latency range during the awake state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prior to inserting an epidural catheter, FHR and maternal vital signs were monitored during a control period in 60 healthy term parturients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.1 mEq sodium bicarbonate added to each 20 ml (n = 30) or 2% lidocaine with 1:300,000 epinephrine (n = 30). A 3-ml test dose of the study solution was injected via the catheter and was followed by an additional 17 ml, in increments; additional doses were administered as necessary to obtain surgical anesthesia. FHR and maternal vital signs were monitored for at least 20 min and the characteristics of the anesthetic block noted. At delivery, neonatal status was evaluated, and maternal and cord blood samples were obtained for local anesthetic assays and neonatal blood gases. The groups were similar with respect to maternal characteristics, onset of surgical anesthesia, time to delivery, and uterine incision-delivery interval. Maternal blood pressure decreased from control values in both groups (P less than 0.05), but there was no difference between the groups in either the incidence of hypotension or ephedrine requirements. Analysis of FHR tracings by a perinatologist blinded to the study group revealed no changes after anesthesia and no significant differences between the groups at any time in basal FHR, short- or long-term variability, or the incidence of accelerations or decelerations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of Ca(2+)-free Krebs Ringer (KR) solution, 5 microM verapamil, 5 microM nifedipine, and 10 microM of the Ca2+ agonist BAY K 8644 on halothane-induced contracture were therefore investigated. The halothane-induced contracture was prevented in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and significantly reduced in the presence of verapamil or nifedipine. BAY K 8644 significantly enhanced the 0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-vol % halothane-induced contracture in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. When BAY K 8644 was dissolved in Ca(2+)-free KR solution, no contracture was observed in MH-susceptible muscle bundles. These results on cut MH-susceptible human muscle bundles support the hypothesis that halothane-induced contracture in MH can be modified by the binding of Ca2+ agonists or antagonists to the dihydropyridine receptor. The role of Ca2+ entry phenomena remains unclear, but the results suggest that extracellular Ca2+ is required to reprime or to bind to some sites of the dihydropyridine receptors.\r"

The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of epidural clonidine on the plasma concentrations and analgesic effect of fentanyl after epidural administration. Twenty ASA physical status 2 or 3 patients recovering from abdominal surgery were allocated randomly to receive either epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in 10 ml isotonic saline; EF group) or epidural fentanyl (same dose) plus epidural clonidine (150 micrograms; EF + C group) in isotonic saline solution. Analgesia was assessed over a period of 12 h after epidural injection. Venous samples were obtained until 360 min after epidural injection for radioimmunoassay determination of plasma fentanyl concentration. Onset of analgesia was similar in the two groups of patients (13 +/- 6 and 13 +/- 3 min, respectively, after injection), but duration was more than doubled in the patients receiving clonidine (543 +/- 183 vs. 250 +/- 64 min). Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations (Fmax) and the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were comparable in the two groups (0.29 +/- 0.15 ng.ml-1 at 16.2 +/- 14.8 min in the EF group and 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng.ml-1 at 8.3 +/- 5.5 min in the EF + C group), as were plasma concentrations at each definite time of measurement. Drowsiness and hypotension were noticed in the EF + C group. Thus, epidural clonidine appears to prolong epidural fentanyl analgesia without affecting its plasma concentration.\r"

The effect on platelet aggregation of three different techniques for reducing blood consumption was studied in 30 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting from the beginning of anesthesia until the 1st postoperative day. The patients were randomly divided into three groups, in which 1) a cell separator was used during and after CPB; 2) a hemofiltration device was used; and 3) high-dose aprotinin was used in order to reduce the need of homologous blood. A fourth group undergoing neurosurgery procedures served as a control. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (concentration 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 microM), collagen (4 microliters/ml), and epinephrine (25 microM) was determined by the turbidimetric method. Platelet aggregation was not significantly changed in the control group, indicating that the operation itself did not impair platelet function. At the end of the operation (after retransfusion of the salvaged pump blood), the maximum aggregation and maximum gradient of aggregation induced by all three inductors were most reduced (significantly) in the cell-separator patients. On the 1st postoperative day, platelet aggregation in the hemofiltration patients and the patients treated with aprotinin had normalized. Aggregation of patients pretreated with high-dose aprotinin was not different from that of the hemofiltration patients throughout the investigation. Blood loss was significantly highest in the cell-separator group (770 +/- 400 ml on the 1st postoperative day) but was not different between the hemofiltration (390 +/- 230 ml) and the aprotinin-treated patients (260 +/- 160 ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used two-dimensional transesophageal contrast echocardiography with sonicated Renografin-76 microbubbles to determine the distribution of myocardial blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery in 15 patients. Sonicated Renografin-76 contrast agent was injected into the aortic root of all patients after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass and application of the aortic occlusive clamp. Eight patients had contrast agent injected directly into the free proximal end of the vein-CABG anastomosis. All patients again received aortic root injections during reperfusion after anastomosis of the proximal aortovein and distal coronary artery. Echocardiographic images of the left ventricle short axis at the level of the papillary muscles were obtained in real time and analyzed retrospectively from videotape. Injection of contrast provided information about the magnitude and geometric distribution of coronary artery-vein bypass run-off and enabled identification of poorly perfused myocardial regions. When predicted myocardial perfusion patterns, based on preoperative evaluation of epicardial vessel distribution derived from coronary angiography, were compared to actual perfusion patterns assessed with intraoperative echocardiography, contrast regional myocardial perfusion patterns were predicted 84% of the time (71-97%, 95% confidence limit). Regional myocardial perfusion deficits detected after coronary bypass grafting were associated with regional wall motion abnormalities detected after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Our technique makes possible on-line visualization of changes in regional blood flow in the heart before, during, and after CABG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The trachea of each patient was intubated with a saline-filled double-cuffed endotracheal tube. Changes in breathing pattern were measured with a pneumotachograph while changes in laryngeal wall tension and tracheal wall tension were assessed by measuring changes in the proximal cuff pressure and the distal cuff pressure, respectively. In 8 of 13 patients, the dose-response relationship for each anesthetic was determined by administering different concentrations (1, 3, and 5%) of gas mixtures. In these patients, nasal insufflation of 1 and 3% of each anesthetic did not produce any reflex response, whereas reflex responses were evident during nasal insufflation of 5% enflurane, isoflurane, and halothane. In all 13 patients, nasal insufflation of all three anesthetics at a concentration of 5% invariably produced changes in breathing pattern characterized by prolongation of expiratory time (TE). However, prolongation of TE was the most pronounced for enflurane (from a control value of 2.1 +/- 0.5 to a maximum value of 4.8 +/- 2.2 s [mean +/- standard deviation]), less for isoflurane (from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 3.9 +/- 1.7 s), and the least for halothane (from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.9 s).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study compared the precision of transesophageal Doppler-derived cardiac output (DdCO) with the precision of thermodilution cardiac output (TdCO) and examined the agreement between DdCO and TdCO in 33 cardiac surgical patients. The proximal pulmonary artery diameter was measured in triplicate during systole and end expiration, and the local blood flow velocity was recorded on video tape. The instantaneous pulmonary artery blood flow velocity (centimeters per second) for three random cardiac beats was integrated with respect to time. DdCO was calculated as the product of the flow velocity integral (centimeters per beat), heart rate (beats per min), and the mean cross-sectional area (centimeters squared) of the main pulmonary artery. At the same time that the velocity recordings were made, three serial determinations of TdCO were made by an independent observer. Pulmonary blood flow could be measured in 25 of the 33 patients. The anatomical relationship among the esophagus, the left main stem bronchus, and the pulmonary artery did not allow adequate imaging of the pulmonary artery in 8 (24%) of the patients. A total of 45 sets of triplicate measurements were made. The range of cardiac outputs encountered was 1.7-6.6 l.min-1 by TdCO and 1.5-6.9 l.min-1 by DdCO.

On a 0-10 verbal analog scale, patient-reported median pain scores at rest and with coughing or ambulation were 1 (inter-quartile range 3) and 4 (interquartile range 4), respectively. The incidence of side effects requiring medication were as follows: pruritus 24%, nausea 29%, and respiratory depression 0.2%. There were no deaths, neurologic injuries, or infections associated with the technique. Migration of epidural catheters into the subarachnoid space and into epidural veins each occurred twice. Overall, 1,051 of the 1,106 patients (95%) experienced none of the following problems: catheter obstruction, premature dislodgement, painful injections, catheter migration, infection, or respiratory depression.

These areas are no longer ischemic, but have diminished contractile performance. Although the effects of loading conditions on systolic contraction of normal, ischemic, and failing myocardium have been investigated in great detail, the way in which load affects contraction of postischemic myocardium is not known. The aim of this study was to determine in anesthetized dogs how loading conditions affect the systolic function of a region of myocardium after 10 min of ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion. Sets of piezoelectric crystals were implanted in a test zone and in a remote zone of myocardium. Measurements of systolic wall thickening were made during nine combinations of left atrial pressure (3, 6, and 9 cmH2O) and mean arterial pressure (70, 90, and 110 mmHg). One set of measurements was made under baseline conditions, and a second set was made after 10 min of coronary occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion reduced wall thickening in the test zone 36 +/- 3% and diminished the response to increases in preload. In contrast, the response of the test zone to changes in afterload was unchanged. An interaction between the test zone (in which depressed contraction was observed) and the surrounding myocardium (in which enhanced function was observed) produced the appearance of a regional wall motion abnormality as afterload increased. These results emphasize that the load dependence of postischemic myocardium differs from that of normal myocardium and must be taken into account in clinical studies in which regional contraction is used to monitor the heart for ischemia.\r"

Pulmonary edema may result from increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure or from increased pulmonary vascular permeability. We therefore studied the effects of a stable thromboxane analog, U46619, on these two parameters in the perfused rabbit lung. Pulmonary capillary pressure was measured by the double vascular occlusion method, and pulmonary vascular permeability was estimated by measurement of the pulmonary fluid filtration coefficient (Kf). U46619 infusion produced pulmonary hypertension and lung weight gain; increased both the arterial (precapillary) and venous (postcapillary) components of pulmonary vascular resistance; and increased pulmonary capillary pressure from 4.7 +/- 0.5 to 9.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg (P less than 0.01). The isogravimetric pressure (equivalent to the capillary pressure corresponding to no lung weight gain) was 4.0 +/- 0.4 mmHg before U46619 and 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg during U46619. Therefore, U46619 significantly increased capillary pressure above isogravimetric pressure and resulted in the development of pulmonary edema. U46619 did not affect vascular permeability as measured by Kf. We conclude that pulmonary venoconstriction resulting in increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure is the major mechanism by which thromboxane produces pulmonary edema in isolated lungs.\r"

We used an isotope dilution technique to investigate the effects of halothane and propofol anesthesia on NE kinetics. A relationship of NE kinetics to halothane dose was determined in six dogs. Halothane 1.0 MAC reduced plasma NE concentration by 35 +/- 9% versus awake (P less than 0.05). This was due to a reduction of 52 +/- 9% in NE spillover (P less than 0.05) accompanied by a reduction of 27 +/- 5% in NE clearance (P less than 0.005).

  ".U": "91362265\r", 
  ".W": "Analgesia is an important component of general anesthesia. alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine are effective analgesics at the spinal level, and furthermore, they reduce the volatile anesthetic requirement. In order to probe a possible spinal-level contribution to general anesthetic-induced analgesia, the effects of dexmedetomidine were tested in an isolated spinal cord preparation. The effects of dexmedetomidine were compared with those of isoflurane, and dexmedetomidine-isoflurane interactions were explored. The test response was a nociceptive-related slow ventral root potential (slow VRP) recorded from the isolated neonatal rat spinal cord in response to electrical stimulation of a dorsal root. At 0.2-1.28 vol%, isoflurane reversibly depressed the slow VRP. At a lower concentration (0.14 vol%), isoflurane increased the slow VRP in three of five preparations. At 1.0-1.28 vol%, isoflurane also depressed the monosynaptic reflex. Recovery on washout usually was to a level greater than control. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (DL)-2-amino 5-phosphonovalerate (10 microM) prevented the rebound to levels above control on isoflurane washout. The earlier components of the slow VRP were more sensitive to isoflurane than were the later. Dexmedetomidine (0.5-10 nM) depressed the slow VRP and had no effect on the monosynaptic reflex. The slow VRP depends on both substance P and glutamate NMDA-receptor-mediated neurotransmission; isoflurance and dexmedetomidine depressed responses to both substance P and NMDA. Although the two agents depress responses to the same neurotransmitters, there is no evidence that they act at the same cellular site(s). There was no significant interaction between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane. The results suggest that isoflurane exerts marked inhibitory effects on spinal neurotransmission, depressing both substance P and glutamate-mediated pathways. There is a possible biphasic effect on the NMDA receptor. To the extent that nociception depends on these neurotransmitters, isoflurane may be expected to exert profound analgesic effects at the spinal level. By blocking responses to strongly arousing stimuli, these effects may contribute to general anesthesia. Suppression of nociceptive neurotransmission at the spinal level may contribute to dexmedetomidine's anesthetic-sparing properties as well as to analgesia by this agent.\r"

  ".W": "The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist medetomidine produces systemic hemodynamic effects that are mediated by both peripheral and central nervous system actions. The current investigation was designed to characterize coronary and systemic hemodynamic effects of the D- and L-stereoisomers of medetomidine in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs with and without autonomic nervous system blockade. Dogs were instrumented for measurement of aortic pressure, coronary blood flow velocity, cardiac output, left ventricular pressure, rate of change in pressure (dP/dt), and subendocardial systolic shortening. Administration of the D-isomer of medetomidine (doses of 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 micrograms/kg, each administered over 10 min, with 60 min between doses) significantly altered systemic hemodynamics, in a biphasic fashion. A decrease in respiratory rate without change in arterial blood gas tensions occurred. With the 5 micrograms/kg dose of D-medetomidine, an initial pressor response was followed by secondary, significant (P less than 0.05), and dose-related decreases in heart rate (74 +/- 3 to 57 +/- 4 beats per min), mean arterial pressure (109 +/- 2 to 100 +/- 3 mmHg) and the rate-pressure product (10.5 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.5 beats.min-1.mmHg.10(3] accompanied by a reduction in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine. No changes in left ventricular end diastolic pressure or coronary blood flow velocity occurred. In contrast to the D-isomer, the L-isomer (1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/kg) produced no changes in hemodynamics or plasma concentrations of norepinephrine. In dogs pretreated with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg), propranolol (2 mg/kg), and atropine methylnitrate (3 mg/kg) to produce autonomic nervous system blockade, D-medetomidine also produced an initial pressor response, but no secondary reduction in heart rate or arterial pressure occurred. The results indicate that the D-isomer of medetomidine is stereospecific for alterations in hemodynamics: the active D-isomer produces decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and the rate-pressure product via diminished sympathetic and/or augmented parasympathetic tone. This conclusion is supported by the absence of these changes after pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose this study was to examine the effects of halothane on baroreflex control of heart rate in developing swine. Serial tests of baroreflex function were performed over the first 2 months of life in eight piglets in the conscious state and during anesthesia with 0.45, 0.9, and 1.35% halothane. Systemic blood pressure was increased with phenylephrine (pressor test) and decreased with nitroprusside (depressor test), and stimulus-response curves relating mean blood pressure to heart rate were constructed. Baroreflex sensitivity was determined as the slope of the linear portion of the curve. Halothane markedly depressed baroreflex sensitivity at all ages in a dose-dependent manner (conscious greater than 0.45% greater than 0.9%, 1.35%). Increasing age was accompanied by decreasing baroreflex sensitivity in both the conscious and the anesthetized states. The difference in baroreflex sensitivity between conscious and anesthetized states did not change with age for the depressor test (tachycardia response), but it did change with age for the pressor test (bradycardia response). For this test, conscious values converged toward anesthetized values at higher ages; therefore, there was relatively less depression by halothane at older ages. Halothane also decreased resting heart rate and decreased the limits and narrowed the range of the baroreflex heart rate response. Increasing age was accompanied by a decreasing resting heart rate and by decreasing limits and a narrowing range of the baroreflex response. The effect of halothane on heart rate variables was similar at all ages. Halothane decreased resting blood pressure and decreased the lower limit and widened the span of the baroreflex blood pressure range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91362268\r", 
  ".W": "Perioperative administration of the alpha 2 agonist clonidine has been shown to increase plasma alfentanil concentrations; however, the mechanism for this pharmacokinetic drug interaction is unknown. Because alfentanil undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformation, clonidine inhibition of alfentanil metabolism may alter alfentanil disposition. The first purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that clonidine impairs human liver alfentanil metabolism. The new highly selective alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine (D-medetomidine) is a substituted imidazole and thus may inhibit hepatic drug biotransformation. The second purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess the effect of D-medetomidine and its levo (L) isomer on alfentanil biotransformation. Human liver microsomal alfentanil metabolism was assessed in vitro using a gas chromatography--mass spectrometry assay. Clonidine, at concentrations as great as 10 microM (far exceeding therapeutic levels), had no significant effect on alfentanil oxidation. In contrast, D-medetomidine and its optical isomer L-medetomidine were potent inhibitors of human liver microsomal alfentanil metabolism. The concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC50) of alfentanil (10 microM) oxidation was 0.7-1.0 and 2.8-4.0 microM for D-medetomidine and L-medetomidine, respectively. Preincubation of D-medetomidine with microsomes did not enhance the inhibition of alfentanil metabolism. These results suggest that the increased alfentanil plasma concentrations and potentiation of alfentanil anesthesia associated with clonidine do not result from clonidine inhibition of alfentanil metabolism. D-medetomidine impairment of alfentanil metabolism, however,if present at therapeutic concentrations, may influence alfentanil disposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A large proportion of the elderly have not received primary immunization for tetanus and do not receive recommended tetanus booster immunizations. Although expert panels support immunization of all persons, without an upper age limit, physicians either are unaware of or do not act on recommendations to immunize the elderly. Improved education of physicians and patients, emphasizing a case-finding approach, may reduce the number of tetanus cases in the elderly. Studies are needed to find ways to improve tetanus immunity in the elderly.\r"

A computer-assisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on fibrinolytic activity and venous thromboembolism. The strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. It is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis. In contrast, for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis. Whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear, since randomized clinical trials that used interventions to enhance fibrinolytic activity produced inconsistent results.\r"
