  ".W": "A retrospective study of 317 cases of suppurative otochondritis occurring in a population of 4794 burned patients successively admitted to one institution between 1967 and 1984 is presented. During the study interval, the incidence of the disease decreased from 20 percent to less than 3 percent in patients with burns of one or both ears. The bacterial species associated with chondritis, principally Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus species, did not change. Patients admitted later than the second postburn day exhibited a significantly greater incidence of chondritis. The crucial factors in prevention of this complication appear to be avoidance of pressure on burned ears and topical chemotherapeutic control of local Pseudomonas infection. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis did not appear to influence the incidence in the studied population. Several approaches to clinical management of suppurative chondritis are reviewed.\r"

The authors present further laboratory evidence, with clinical cases, attesting to the adequacy of the periosteal circulation alone. Our surgical technique varies from other reports in that a substantially greater length of the internal mammary vessels is harvested and includes the dual periosteal supply by means of the supracostal and intercostal vessels, both branches of the internal mammary vessels. This modification is based on anatomic and angiographic findings. The incorporation of both branches enhances the margin of safety in raising this free bone graft.\r"

Anchoring of the inferior skin flap to the tough, inelastic deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia has reduced such complications. Originally described by Colles in 1811, this fascial layer helps define the perineal-thigh crease. Eighteen patients having medial thigh lifts in combination with liposuction were followed for 6 to 24 months. The technique involves initial liposuction followed by resection of a crescent of redundant skin and fat at the superior medial thigh. The inferior skin flap is suspended from Colles' fascia of the perineum with subdermal PDS sutures. No undermining or deepithelialization of flaps is performed. Complications are few, and patient satisfaction is high.\r"

It was found that the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessel was an ideal axial vessel. There are constant perforating branches of the myocutaneous artery or cutaneous branches from the intermuscular space to the anterolateral femoral skin. The area extends about 12 x 30 cm. Within the flap, the anterior branch of the anterolateral cutaneous nerve of the high is located. This flap has been widely used for free transplantation in China since 1983 with satisfactory results.\r"

This folded fibula provides twice the cross-sectional area of a single fibula transfer and allows biomechanically improved graft placement. This technique has been successfully used in long bone defects of the upper and lower limbs.\r"

Of the saphenous flaps, 14 percent survived. Of the flaps based on the cephalic vein, 75 percent survived. Cephalic composite-tissue grafts were 13 percent successful. The presence of a more intricate venous plexus in a flap seems to increase its chances of success. Arterial injections of radioisotope-labeled microspheres were used to chart revascularization in cephalic flaps. These flaps demonstrated arterial blood flow by day 3, while the composite grafts showed no flow until day 7. Venous injections of microspheres distal to the flap were used to test vein-to-capillary blood flow. No significant entrapment of microspheres within the flaps occurred at any time, suggesting such flow to be inadequate.\r"

  ".W": "The delay phenomenon was studied by measuring tissue oxygen tension (PsqO2) for 3 weeks in delayed flaps and normal adjacent contralateral skin in seven mongrel dogs. The PsqO2 fell after elevation of a bipedicle flap and rose again to normal by day 14. Delivery of oxygen to this flap was improved by surgical delay, so that when the bipedicle flap was reelevated on day 14 and its distal pedicle divided, minimal changes in PsqO2 occurred. When the control area was elevated on day 14 as a random-pattern flap, it had higher PsqO2 values than measured in the bipedicle flap on day 0, and therefore, it too had participated in the delay phenomenon, even though only its midline edge had been incised. An anatomic explanation for the findings was sought in wounds made in 10 rabbit ear chambers. After injury, blood flow was seen to be rerouted parallel to the incision line and was increased first by vasodilation and then also by angiogenesis until about day 14. Rerouting of blood by injury, inflammation, and angiogenesis due to repair appears to account for a significant portion of the delay phenomenon.\r"

The mechanisms through which social relationships affect health and the factors that promote or inhibit the development and maintenance of social relationships remain to be explored.\r"

  ".W": "A series of four hairpin deoxyoligonucleotides was synthesized with a four-nucleotide central loop (either C or G) flanked by the complementary sequences d(T)10 and d(A)10. Two of the molecules contain either a 3'-p-3' or 5'-p-5' linkage in the loop, so that the strands in the stem have the same, that is, parallel (ps) polarity. The pair of reference oligonucleotides have normal phosphodiester linkages throughout and antiparallel (aps) stem regions. All the molecules adopt a duplex helical structure in that (i) the electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels of the ps and aps oligomers are similar. (ii) The ps hairpins are substrates for T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and Escherichia coli exonuclease III. (iii) Salt-dependent thermal transitions are observed for all hairpins, but the ps molecules denature 10 degrees C lower than the corresponding aps oligomers. (iv) The ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectra are indicative of a base-paired duplex in the stems of the ps hairpins but differ systematically from those of the aps counterparts. (v) The bis-benzimidazole drug Hoechst-33258, which binds in the minor groove of B-DNA, exhibits very little fluorescence in the presence of the ps hairpins but a normal, enhanced emission with the aps oligonucleotides. In contrast, the intercalator ethidium bromide forms a strongly fluorescent complex with all hairpins, the intensity of which is even higher for the ps species. (vi) The pattern of chemical methylation is the same for both the ps and aps hairpins. The combined results are consistent with the prediction from force field analysis of a parallel stranded right-handed helical form of d(A)n.d(T)n with a secondary structure involving reverse Watson-Crick base pairs and a stability not significantly different from that of the B-DNA double helix. Models of the various hairpins optimized with force field calculations are described.\r"

The physiological effects of serotonin are initiated by the activation of multiple, distinct receptor subtypes. Cloning in RNA expression vectors was combined with a sensitive electrophysiological assay in Xenopus oocytes in order to isolate a functional cDNA clone encoding the 5HTlc serotonin receptor. Injection of RNA transcribed in vitro from this clone into Xenopus oocytes elicits serotonin sensitivity. Mouse fibroblasts transformed with this clone bind serotonin agonists and antagonists and exhibit an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in response to serotonin. The sequence of the 5HTlc receptor reveals that it belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, which are thought to traverse the cytoplasmic membrane seven times. Moreover, in situ hybridization and RNA blot analysis indicate that the 5HTlc receptor is expressed in neurons in many regions of the central nervous system and suggest that this subclass of receptor may mediate many of the central actions of serotonin.\r"

A new technique of direct binding of radioactive DNA was used to screen a complementary DNA expression library from the BJAB cell line in lambda gt11 phage to derive molecular cDNA clones representing a putative B lymphocyte-specific octamer binding protein. The plaques were screened with DNA containing four copies of the octamer sequence and positive phage recombinants were identified. The fusion protein produced on inducing a lysogen of one phage bound to a monomeric octamer probe. The cDNA insert from this phage hybridized to messenger RNA found in B lymphocytes, but not in most other cells. Thus, this cDNA derives from a gene (oct-2) that specifies an octamer binding protein expressed preferentially in B lymphocytes, proving that, for at least one gene, a cell-specific transcription factor exists and its amount is controlled through messenger RNA availability.\r"

The electrical properties of these cells were studied with the whole-cell patch clamp technique, and the hypothesis that ionic conductances can be altered by changes in PO2 was tested. The results show that type I cells have voltage-dependent sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Sodium and calcium currents were unaffected by a decrease in PO2 from 150 to 10 millimeters of mercury, whereas, with the same experimental protocol, potassium currents were reversibly reduced by 25 to 50 percent. The effect of hypoxia was independent of internal adenosine triphosphate and calcium. Thus, ionic conductances, and particularly the O2-sensitive potassium current, play a key role in the transduction mechanism of arterial chemoreceptors.\r"

This dual mechanism of drug resistance was demonstrated in cell lines that had acquired the multidrug-resistant phenotype and in human colorectal cancer cells with de novo resistance. These studies support a model of acquired and de novo multidrug resistance that includes alterations in both drug accumulation and the glutathione redox cycle.\r"

The predicted transmembrane segment of Qa-2 differs from those of H-2 K, D, and L by the presence of an aspartate in place of a valine at position 295. A single base change that replaced this aspartate with valine resulted in cell-surface Qa-2 molecules that were insensitive to hydrolysis by a PI-specific phospholipase C and more resistant to papain cleavage, properties shared by H-2D. Cells expressing Asp----Val mutant Qa-2 proteins were still able to attach a PI anchor to endogenous proteins such as Thy-1 and J11D. It therefore appears that this single amino acid change converts Qa-2 from a PI-linked form into an integral membrane protein.\r"

Prompt diagnosis and restoration of blood flow is essential; otherwise, massive intestinal resection occurs, leading to death or, in the survivors, intestinal cripples. In this study, the time of warm reversible ischemia in the canine intestine was explored. After this time was established, fluids and antibiotics were administered to note change in survival times. Massive intestinal ischemia (superior mesenteric artery was clamped) was tolerated without death for five hours (20 dogs in each group). With six hours of ischemia, a 10 per cent mortality rate occurred; with seven hours of ischemia, a 90 per cent mortality rate occurred. These dogs had a maintenance of 75 milliliters of fluid administered per hour. Using this group of dogs as the control (that is, the group with seven hour clamping time of the superior mesenteric artery with maintenance intravenously administered replacement), fluids were given to dogs in the experimental group to keep the pulmonary artery wedge pressure at a normal value (average of 300 milliliters per hour). This group of dogs had an increased survival rate of 40 per cent (ten dogs). Antibiotics were given to the dogs in the experimental group both before and after clamping, increasing the over-all survival rate to more than 80 per cent (46 dogs). Aggressive fluid replacement and antibiotic coverage may lengthen the so-called golden period in which intestinal ischemia may be reversed by revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the advantages and complications of splenectomy in the treatment of beta thalassemia, 221 splenectomies for thalassemia performed upon pediatric patients from 1971 to 1982 are evaluated. There were 125 boys and 96 girls with a mean age of 8.2 +/- 2.5 years at the time of the operation. Sixty-one other patients who underwent splenectomy for other diseases served as the controls. Early and late complications after splenectomy are considered with a follow-up study of ten years. Hemoglobin (Hb) value, transfusional quotients and mean of transfused blood previous to surgical treatment are matched with the same parameters evaluated during the follow-up period. The effect of treatment with salicylates and dipyridamole upon the incidence of early complications after operation is analyzed. The postoperative complications in patients with thalassemia were 43.4 versus 3.2 per cent (p less than 0.01) registered in control patients. Late complications occurred with an incidence of 10.7 per cent and were due principally to sepsis. Six patients died of sepsis during the follow-up period, but the mortality rate for sepsis in the patients we studied was significantly lower than that reported by others in 73 instances of splenectomy for beta thalassemia. Blood consumption dropped from 270 +/- 99 to 155 +/- 31 milliliters per kilogram per year postoperatively (p less than 0.01) and Hb levels rose from 9.7 +/- 1.3 to 11.2 +/- 0.7 grams per milliliter. These results suggest that, even though splenectomy for beta thalassemia causes a relevant incidence of complications and fatalities, surgical treatment permits an improvement in the quality of the lives of patients with beta thalassemia and significantly reduces blood consumption. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy can reduce the incidence of sepsis, as was observed in the patients we studied.\r"

These problems have been attributed without objective evidence to the partial gastrectomy that is performed at the time of the pancreatoduodenectomy. The dumping syndrome has been implicated, and the results of this study determine, for the first time, the role of the dumping syndrome in pancreatic surgical procedures. Sixty-four dumping provocation tests have been performed upon patients with pancreatic disease or after pancreatic surgical treatment. Three patients had the dumping syndrome, and in eight, the result of the test was equivocal. Results of the present study demonstrate an incidence of dumping syndrome after pancreatoduodenectomy of 10 per cent; however, in none of these patients, was the dumping syndrome a significant problem. There was no instance of the dumping syndrome after pylorus-preserving or duodenum-preserving pancreatectomy. It is concluded that, contrary to previous assumptions, the dumping syndrome does not contribute to long term postoperative problems after pancreatic surgical procedures.\r"

The rational for using Prolene as the mesh material is discussed in relation with the other materials available. The technique is outlined in detail along with precautions to decrease the already low recurrence rate documented in this series. From 1978 through 1985, 745 repairs were analysed. The complication and recurrence rates were minimal, and the follow-up rate was 87 per cent. A plea is made not to report recurrence rates without follow-up rates.

The study was undertaken to refine selection criteria for biopsy in women with nonpalpable mammographic abnormalities by comparing mammographic features and impression with histologic findings. Twenty-eight of 36 (78 per cent) noninfiltrating carcinomas presented with microcalcifications alone; in contrast, 27 of 39 (69 per cent) infiltrating carcinomas presented with a mass alone. As the number of microcalcifications increased, so did the incidence of carcinoma. The size of the mass was not a guide for predicting carcinoma. Although only 11 of 75 carcinomas presented as a mass with microcalcifications, 11 of 21 calcified masses were carcinoma. There were no significant differences in the mammographic presentation between ductal and lobular carcinoma. The sensitivity of the mammographic impression was 48/75 (0.64), and the specificity was 221/246 (0.898). The false-positive rate was 25/73 (0.34), and the false-negative rate was 10/141 (0.07). From this study, we concluded 1, the incidence of noninfiltrating carcinoma was significantly higher and the incidence of positive nodes was significantly lower in nonpalpable abnormalities than in palpable masses; 2, noninfiltrating carcinomas were generally associated with microcalcifications alone, but infiltrating carcinomas were generally associated with a mass alone, and 3, the diagnostic accuracy of mammography was limited by under-interpretation of the subtler signs of noninfiltrating carcinoma and by over-interpretation of mammographic findings generally accepted as criteria for carcinoma.\r"

A prospective nonrandomized study was conducted between January 1985 and January 1987 examining complications, child and parental acceptance and costs between totally implantable venous access devices (ports) and externally exiting catheters. Fifty ports were placed in 49 patients who had a median age of ten years; median implant time was 350 days. Forty-one catheters were placed in 39 patients who had a median age of eight years; median implant time was 365 days. Both devices provided equivalent venous access. Although catheters were initially less expensive, the cost for both devices was comparable by the six month point. Beyond this time, an increasing savings was realized when the port was used. Catheter device complications occurred 14 times compared with seven with ports (p less than 0.02). There were 15 infectious complications with catheters compared with seven with ports (p less than 0.01). Child and parental acceptance questionnaires indicated that the ports were easier to care for and more readily accepted in children older than 11 years than were catheters (p less than 0.001). Totally implanted reservoirs are effective alternatives to external catheters for venous access in children with cancer.\r"

From 1982 to present, we performed 25 explorations of the common bile duct entirely through the cystic duct in patients in whom duct size was large enough to permit passage of instrumentation greater than 6.5 millimeters in diameter. All instrumentation, including biliary Fogarty balloon-tipped catheterization and fiberoptic choledochoscopy, was used through the cystic duct without difficulty. No complications of bile leakage or stricture formation were encountered, and all patients are doing well at five and one-half years after surgical treatment without known retained stones. The early community hospital experience of this report supports the view that exploration of the common bile duct through a suitably sized cystic duct is a safe, efficient and effective alternative to choledochotomy for exposure of the common bile duct.\r"

No complications have been encountered using this tool in the 63 patients intervened since 1982 and the operating time has been shortened creating an adequate size tunnel for the pull-through procedure. Excellent traction of the intestinal segment is provided, and the use of pursestring sutures and clamps is avoided. In addition, the simplified technique prevented leakage of the anastomosed contents of the intestine, therefore, minimizing contamination.\r"

Additionally, via a transzygomatic-subtemporal approach the preauricular petrosal bone is removed anteriorly up to the petrosal tip and laterally as far as the petrosal portion of the internal carotid artery, while the cochlea is preserved. By this means, the triangular portion of the posterior petrosal dura mater, delimited by the superior petrosal sinus, inferior petrosal sinus, and sigmoid sinus, is well exposed extradurally. By opening the subtemporal and posterior petrosal dura mater, in combination with a tentoriotomy, adequate exposure of the basilar artery, vertebral arteries, ventral and lateral portions of the brainstem, and cranial nerves is achieved with minimal retraction of the temporal lobe and cerebellum.\r"

With the use of selective alpha-adrenergic agents, this study was designed to discriminate between the vascular and transport effects. Rabbit 20 cm ileal segments (n = 31) were vascularly perfused at a rate of 1.5 ml/min by means of a modified Krebs solution containing 15% to 20% red cells. The intestinal lumen was perfused with an isotonic solution containing carbon 14-polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable marker. Net fluxes of water and electrolytes were calculated during 20-minute basal, experimental, and recovery periods. Norepinephrine (mixed alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonist) significantly increased intestinal absorption and vascular resistance. Phenylephrine (alpha 1-agonist) significantly increased vascular resistance without altering transport. Clonidine (alpha 2-agonist) stimulated intestinal absorption without changing vascular perfusion pressure. Yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist) prevented norepinephrine-induced absorption but had no effect on norepinephrine-induced increases in perfusion pressure. In this isolated perfused whole gut model, alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation was responsible for increases in vascular resistance, and alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation was responsible for increases in the absorption of water and electrolytes. The ability to discriminate between alpha 1- and alpha 2-effects has potential therapeutic implications in patients with malabsorption and diarrhea.\r"

Chronic hypercalcemia was maintained by diet and by vitamin D and dihydrotachysterol injections. Portal venous blood was analyzed for large dextran molecules that had been perfused through the pancreatic duct. In a separate group of hypercalcemic animals, we perfused the duct with activated pancreatic enzymes to induce acute pancreatitis. After 24 hours of hypercalcemia, dextrans were detected in the portal venous blood of 6 of 11 hypercalcemic and none of the 6 control animals (p less than 0.05). After 12 hours of hypercalcemia, dextrans were detected in all 7 hypercalcemic and 1 of 7 control animals (p less than 0.001). The degree of pancreatic inflammation was greater in the 12-hour animals than in the controls (p less than 0.001). After 14 days of hypercalcemia, however, there were no differences in dextran permeability or pancreatitis in experimental or control animals. Our results indicate that acute hypercalcemia increases the permeability of the pancreatic duct to molecules the size of pancreatic enzymes. This could be important in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis associated with hypercalcemic states.\r"

In this study we performed vein bypass grafting of the carotid arteries in rabbits and examined the grafts for the presence of mast cells. We also determined vein graft vasoreactivity to histamine, to assess whether mediators of mast cells may have a functional role in vivo. In the control veins no mast cells were identified in 80 high-power fields (400X). In the vein bypass grafts an average of 2.6 +/- 0.8 (p = 0.01) mast cells were identified in the same number of high-power fields. Isometric tension studies of control vein and vein bypass grafts treated with histamine resulted in sigmoid dose-response curves. The ED50 for control vein was 4.69 +/- 0.63 X 10(-5) mol/L. Compared with control vein, the vein bypass grafts showed a rightward shift in the dose-response curve to histamine (ED50 11.6 +/- 1.7 X 10(-5) mol/L, p = 0.01). The histaminergic response in both vessels was blocked by the H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine (10(-7) mol/L) and was not altered by the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (10(-5) mol/L). The decreased sensitivity of vein bypass grafts to histamine suggests receptor down-regulation and is possibly the result of increased histamine in the vein bypass grafts. The presence of mast cells and histamine receptors, as well as altered histamine sensitivity, in vein bypass grafts suggests that infiltration by these cells may contribute to vein bypass graft vasospasm.\r"

Rats were subjected to 30 minutes of shock (30 mm Hg) followed by reinfusion of shed blood. Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage and reinfusion, the mesenteric lymph node, liver, and spleen were harvested from each animal for bacterial culture, and the ileum and cecum were examined histologically. Sham-shocked (control) rats were instrumented, but blood was not withdrawn. The incidence of BT was higher in the shocked rats (61%) than in the sham-shocked animals (7%) (p less than 0.01). Allopurinol (50 mg/kg, administered orally), a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, reduced the incidence of shock-induced BT to 14% (p = 0.02). Similarly, rats fed a tungsten-supplemented molybdenum-free diet, which inactivates xanthine oxidase, reduced shock-induced BT to 10% (p = 0.02). The histologic damage cause by hemorrhagic shock was prevented by blocking xanthine oxidase activity. Thus hemorrhagic shock-induced bacterial translocation from the gut appears to be mediated by oxidants generated by activation of the xanthine oxidase system.\r"

We investigated the mechanism responsible for this form of pulmonary damage in chronically prepared sheep previously made leukopenic with intra-arterial infusions of nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine hydrochloride). A control air insufflated group (sham: n = 6), a cotton smoke insufflated group (smoke: n = 12), and a leukopenic cotton smoke insufflation group (smoked + depleted: n = 6) were compared. Although both smoke insufflation groups had equivalent smoke exposure, which was indexed by carboxyhemoglobin, the smoked + depleted group had significant attenuation in the increases in pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary lymph flow. The PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (P:F) did not fall to the same extent, nor was there a fall in PaO2. The production of oxygen radicals, which was measured as plasma-conjugated dienes, and the consumption of antiprotease, as measured by alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in lung lymph, were not changed in the smoked + depleted group, whereas it was elevated in the smoked group. We conclude that circulating leukocytes and the release of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes contribute to the lung injury, pulmonary microvascular permeability increase, and pulmonary edema seen after smoke inhalation.\r"

SCPP was defined as the mean distal aortic pressure minus the CSF pressure. In the experimental group, CSF was drained before AXC. SEP changes were quantitated as time to latency increase of 10% (L-10) and time to complete SEP loss. Drainage of CSF had no significant effect on the distal aortic pressure but significantly increased SCPP from 9.4 to 21.8 mm Hg and decreased the incidence of postoperative neurologic injury. Ischemic SEP changes were highly significant predictors of postoperative neurologic injury, occurring more than two times earlier in the paralyzed and paraparetic animals. Dogs without neurologic injury had significantly higher SCPP, delayed L-10 time, and delayed SEP loss.\r"

Altered renal vascular reactivity (RVR) may contribute to the development of decreased renal blood flow. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of bile duct ligation (BDL) on RVR to norepinephrine and angiotensin II in the rat and to evaluate the role of prostaglandins in the modulation of altered RVR. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either sham operation (SO) or BDL. Four days later, isolated kidney perfusions were established. Dose-response curves to norepinephrine (SO, n = 9; BDL, n = 10) and angiotensin II (SO, n = 7; BDL, n = 9) were obtained. The perfusate was modified to contain indomethacin, 10(-6) mol/L, and dose-response curves to norepinephrine (SO, n = 10; BDL, n = 8) and angiotensin II (SO, n = 4; BDL, n = 8) were obtained as well. Baseline resistances did not differ between any of the groups. RVR to norepinephrine did not appear to be altered by BDL; however, increased RVR to norepinephrine was unmasked by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. BDL did not affect the RVR to angiotensin II with or without indomethacin. BDL is associated with an increase in renal vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, which is balanced by a compensatory increase in renal prostaglandin activity in response to norepinephrine stimulation. These findings are consistent with theories that decreased renal perfusion associated with liver disease may be mediated by catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "Renal ischemia is a multifactorial insult consisting of both hypoxia and stagnation of blood flow. This study compared the renal response with hypoxia alone versus ischemia (hypoxia and stagnation of flow). Isolated rat kidneys were perfused at 90 to 110 mm Hg and 37 degrees C with an asanguinous modified Krebs' buffer. Perfusate flow rate, vascular resistance, urine flow rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), percent sodium reabsorption, and oxygen consumption were measured. Five groups were examined: 10-minute hypoxia (HYP10), 30-minute hypoxia (HYP30), 10-minute ischemia (ISC10), 30-minute ischemia (ISC30), and time-matched controls. HYP10 resulted in isolated tubular dysfunction, as evidenced by an increase in urine flow rate and a decrease in percent sodium reabsorption. ISC10 caused decreased GFR, oliguria, and more severe tubular dysfunction. The pattern of glomerular and tubular dysfunction after HYP30 was similar to that after ISC30. Glomerular dysfunction was associated with a decrease in perfusate flow rate and an increase in vascular resistance only after ISC30. This suggests that the decrease in GFR seen with postischemic renal dysfunction is not a primary result of decreased flow. Furthermore, hypoxia does not account for the entire reduction in renal function after ischemia of similar duration. The more severe dysfunction after ischemia may be a consequence of the stagnation of renal flow (anaerobic waste product accumulation and inadequate nutrient supply).\r"

This factor was localized to platelet granules and was released during coagulation. This study was undertaken to identify this factor in platelet granules. Platelet supernatants containing granule contents were incubated with neutrophils, and CR3 expression was determined by flow cytometry. Incubation with platelet supernatants induced more than a twofold increase in the amount of CR3 expressed on the neutrophil membrane (p = 0.05). Anti-platelet-derived growth factor (anti-PDGF) Fab, when preincubated with the platelet supernatants, completely inhibited this CR3-inducing activity. Pure PDGF induced a dose-response increase in CR3, whereas platelet factor 4 had no effect. PDGF was active in concentrations well within the physiologic range. These data indicate that PDGF is responsible for the CR3-inducing activity of platelet supernatants. PDGF may well be an important regulator of neutrophil adherence and phagocytic function in areas of tissue injury.\r"

  ".W": "Nine hundred sixty-four patients undergoing single valve replacement (SVR) procedures alone or in combination with other cardiac surgical procedures were analyzed prospectively to determine whether the risks of operative mortality (OM) are different when the operation is performed by a resident under direct supervision of an attending surgeon (group I, 49.5%) or by an attending surgeon (group II, 50.5%). The overall OM rate was 8.4% (7.2% for group I and 9.7% for group II, which was not significant). Fifty-eight clinical, angiographic, and hemodynamic variables were analyzed to adjust statistically for differences in patient characteristics in each group. For aortic valve replacement, group II patients had smaller valve area and a higher incidence of three-vessel coronary artery disease, and more patients required resection of an ascending aortic aneurysm, whereas group I patients had higher incidence of peripheral edema and S3 gallop. For mitral valve replacement, more patients in group II had pleural effusion, previous cardiac operations, higher mean pulmonary artery pressures, mitral insufficiency due to coronary artery disease, and were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 3 and 4, whereas the group I patients had higher incidence of S3 gallop and elevated serum creatinine. Expected OM for each group was derived from a multivariate logistic model. Ratio of observed-to-expected (O/E) OM was calculated to adjust observed OM according to the risk of patients. There was no difference in O/E mortality ratio between the two groups. We conclude that OM probability is not increased when the SVR procedure is performed by residents under direct supervision of attending surgeons when adjusted for patient- and disease-related risk factors. These findings also constitute compelling evidence that patient care does not suffer when resident teaching experience is enhanced in teaching institutions.\r"

A series of eight neuropsychological tests--digit symbols, digit vigilance, story memory, trail making, PASAT, Raven matrices, delayed story, and pegboard--and a questionnaire on mood states were completed by the residents both when fatigued (less than 4 hours of sleep: mean, 2.0 +/- 1.5 hours) and when rested (more than 4 hours of sleep: mean, 6.5 +/- 1.0 hours), with at least 7 days between tests. In order to eliminate the effects of learning from the first test series, randomization of residents was performed so that one half were first evaluated when rested and one half when fatigued. ANOVA, multiple regression analysis, and the Student t test were used to assess differences. In the acute sleep-deprived state, residents were less vigorous and more fatigued, depressed, tense, confused, and angry (p less than 0.05) than they were in rested state. Despite these changes in mood, however, the responses on all of the functional tests were no different statistically in those who were rested and those who were fatigued (even in those with less than 2 hours' sleep). We conclude that acute sleep deprivation of less than 4 hours alters mood state but does not change performance in test situations in which concentration, clear thinking, and problem solving are important.\r"

We studied the motor response to intravenous motilin and morphine in six dogs after total duodenectomy and in six normal dogs. Motilin (0.1 micrograms/kg) and morphine (200 micrograms/kg) induced large-amplitude gastric contractions after duodenectomy. The duration of gastric contractions after motilin (4.4 +/- 0.3 minutes; mean +/- SEM) was less than spontaneous or motilin-induced gastric phase III in controls (21 +/- 2 minutes and 11 +/- 2 minutes, respectively; p less than 0.01), while the response to morphine (7.4 +/- 3.7 minutes) was less than spontaneous (21 +/- 2 minutes; p less than 0.01) but similar to morphine-induced phase III in controls (7.7 +/- 0.9 minutes). After morphine, plasma motilin increased by 51 +/- 6 pg/ml, but the magnitude of increase was not correlated with the effectiveness of morphine in inducing gastric contractions. Both agents induced phase III-like activity in the jejunum. The durations of jejunal phase III activity after motilin (6.2 +/- 0.3 minutes) and morphine (6.4 +/- 0.3 minutes) were greater than spontaneous phase III after duodenectomy (4.8 +/- 0.4 minutes; p less than or equal to 0.05) and in controls (4.7 +/- 0.2 minutes; p less than 0.05). The latency of response to motilin in the stomach (0.2 +/- 0.1 minute) was less than in jejunum (8.9 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.05), but the latency after morphine was not different in stomach and jejunum (2.9 +/- 0.9 minutes and 2.8 +/- 0.8 minutes, respectively). These observations suggested that the duodenum, possibly by the release of endogenous motilin, may \"recruit\" and further augment the gastric response to initiation of the migrating motor complex. Also, the mechanism for initiation of the migrating motor complex in the stomach and in the jejunum may differ.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intragastric instillation of a protein meal on regional myoelectric activity of the opossum sphincter of Oddi. Seven adult opossums were chronically prepared with self-retaining bipolar electrodes secured to the proximal and distal parts of the sphincter. After a 2-week recovery period, and with the animals fasted and conscious, myoelectric activity was recorded for two cycles of the migrating myoelectric complex. The animals then received graded calories of protein through an orogastric tube and recordings were continued until return of the fasted cyclic activity. Doses of 60, 120, and 240 kcal of protein elicited increases in myoelectric spike activity of the proximal sphincter of 18.7%, 41.9%, and 66.6%, respectively. Similarly, the length of the fed state was prolonged by increasing caloric loads, with mean (plus or minus standard error of the mean) times of 266 +/- 25, 292 +/- 15, and 375 +/- 42 minutes for each dose. A similar relationship was noted in the distal part of the sphincter. Regression analysis between the proximal and distal parts of the sphincter during the fasted and fed states showed a strong and persistent correlation of gradient of spikeburst frequency. We conclude that myoelectric spike frequency of the opossum sphincter of Oddi exhibits a dose-related response to intragastric protein calories. Furthermore, the proximal and distal parts of the sphincter remain electrically coupled, with the proximal region pacing the distal region during the fasted state and after protein administration.\r"

Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension had significantly lower nutrient hepatic blood flow than normal persons; this was due almost entirely to reduced portal flow. In patients with prograde portal flow after small-diameter H grafts nutrient hepatic blood flows were nominally reduced from levels seen in patients with portal hypertensive cirrhosis. Postoperative patients with reversed portal flow had significantly less nutrient hepatic blood than those with prograde flow. There was no evidence of significant hepatic arterial compensation for lost portal flow. Of four hemodynamic variables--portal flow direction, portal flow, arterial flow, and nutrient hepatic blood flow--only nutrient hepatic blood flow showed an independent correlation with clinical outcome. Portal perfusion is a critical factor in maintenance of adequate nutrient hepatic blood flow, primarily because hepatic arterial flow does not compensate chronically for lost portal perfusion.\r"

Twelve adult male baboons were randomized into two groups of six. All animals were studied three times per week for 5 weeks. A unit of blood was donated when on any study day the hematocrit was greater than 30%. Animals received intravenously either 750 units/kg of r-HuEPO (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6) on each study day.

Nonhormonal changes in [Ca++] have been related to acute changes in serum pH, but these have been believed small. With use of an experimental model of acute pancreatitis, we measured changes in [Ca++] and related them to changes in other serum constituents known to affect it. All 18 animals studied experienced a decrease in total serum calcium concentration [CaT]. Changes in [CaT] correlated only with changes in protein-bound calcium concentration [CaP] (r = 0.98, p less than or equal to 0.0005). They did not correlate independently with changes in albumin, globulin, or total protein concentration. [CaP] varied as a function of albumin, globulin, and phosphate concentration and pH according to the equation: [CaP] = 17.9 +/- 0.89 [albumin] = 0.68 [globulin] - 2.5 pH + 0.12 [phosphate]. Calculated values for [CaP], when this equation was used, correlated strongly with observed values for [CaP] (r = 0.81, p less than or equal to 0.0005). Measured [Ca++] increased in the animals early during pancreatitis and then returned to baseline levels. A few animals experienced ionized hypocalcemia. [Ca++] correlated only with changes in pH (r = 0.87, p less than or equal to 0.02). The calculated response slope was delta [Ca++]/delta pH = -2.9. It is concluded that pH has a greater effect on [Ca++] than previously recognized. The major determinant of [CaT] during periods of rapid physiologic change appears to be [CaP] while that for [Ca++] is pH.\r"

  ".W": "Functional gastrin-containing tumor cells (GT cells) have been maintained in short-term culture on microporous membranes, and their response to selected agents has been determined. After dispersion of gastrinoma by collagenase-DNAase digestion coupled with mechanical disruption, dispersed cells were depleted in stromal material by selective attachment to a plastic substrate, then cultured for 72 hours on porous cellulose membranes. Cultures contained 68 +/- 5% GT cells with a viability of 92 +/- 2%. Secretin stimulated the rate of gastrin release from cultured GT cells in both a time- and a dose-dependent fashion. To examine the possible involvement of adenylate cyclase- and protein kinase C-mediated mechanisms in regulating gastrin release from the neoplastic GT cells, we evaluated the effects of 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcAMP; 10(-4) - 10(-2) mol/L), the diterpene forskolin (10(-5) mol/L), 12-0-tetradencanoylphorobol 13-acetate (TPA; 10(-8) - 10(-6) mol/L), and 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4 alpha PDD; 10(-8) - 10(-6) mol/L) on gastrin release. Among all compounds tested, 8-BrcAMP (10(-2) mol/L) was the most potent, stimulating the rate of gastrin release 263% above basal. Both 8-BrcAMP and TPA stimulated gastrin release in a dose-dependent fashion. The biologically inactive phorbol ester, 4 alpha PDD, was without effect at all concentrations. Somatostatin (10(-8) - 10(-6) mol/L) inhibited 8-BrcAMP-stimulated gastrin release in a dose-dependent fashion to a maximum of 75%.\r"

The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded for 5 minutes and injected intraperitoneally immediately after ischemia with an alkylene iminopropylene derivative (glutamate blocker) or a piperazinyl ethanol derivative (calcium blocker) given at high or low doses. Two vehicle groups received saline or 0.2% methyl cellulose solution. Seven days later, the gerbils were perfusion-fixed and their brains were processed for histologic study. The number of neurons per millimeter (neuronal density) of the CA1 region was calculated, and the neuronal density in each group was statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Compared with a control group not subjected to carotid ligation, neurons of the two vehicle groups and the low-dose calcium blocker group were almost nonexistent in the CA1 region. Neuronal densities of the glutamate blocker group and the high-dose calcium blocker group were similar and were found to be within normal limits by statistical analysis. Our study shows that detrimental membrane phenomena and the incidence of delayed neuronal death may be counteracted by the systemic administration of these ion channel blockers after ischemic insult.\r"

The gerbils were treated with either saline vehicle or 10 mg/kg i.p. of one of the test drugs 30 minutes before and again 2 hours after a 10-minute period of bilateral carotid artery occlusion or sham occlusion under light methoxyflurane anesthesia. Seven days after ischemia and reperfusion the brains were perfusion-fixed, and hippocampal CA1 cells were counted in a blind fashion. In ischemic gerbils that received only vehicle, there was a 78.9% loss of CA1 neurons compared with sham-occluded gerbils. In contrast, in U50488H-treated gerbils, mean cell loss was reduced to 33.9% (p less than 0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group). U62066E was even more effective in reducing postischemic CA1 degeneration to only 20.7% (p less than 0.0001 vs. vehicle-treated group). However, treatment with the non-kappa analogue U54494A did not cause any apparent protection; the gerbils in this group showed an 80.7% loss of CA1 neurons. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that kappa-receptor stimulation is associated with improved postischemic neuronal preservation.\r"

We investigated the effects of U74006F on the early ionic edema produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Intravenous doses of 3 mg/kg U74006F were given 10 minutes and 3 hours after occlusion. Tissue concentrations of Na+, K+, and water at and around the infarct site were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by wet-dry weight measurements 24 hours after occlusion. Compared with vehicle treatment, U74006F treatment reduced brain water entry, Na+ accumulation, K+ loss, and net ion shift by 25-50% in most brain areas sampled in the frontal and parietal cortex. However, reductions of ionic edema were most prominent and reached significance (p less than 0.005, unpaired two-tailed t test) mostly in the frontoparietal and parietal cortex areas adjacent to the infarct site. Our findings suggest that a steroid drug without glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity can reduce edema in cerebral ischemia but that the effects are largely limited to tissues in which collateral blood flow may be present.\r"

We found no benefit, in terms of neurologic functional outcome, from lidoflazine, nimodipine, or nicardipine. All three agents elevated regional blood flow in the spinal cord. We conclude that calcium antagonists are not likely to prove beneficial if used alone in the treatment of focal central nervous system ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the ganglioside GM1 on amplitude of the electroencephalogram, neurologic function, and histology has been studied in chronic middle cerebral artery occlusion in cats. Ischemia was produced by a 2-hour occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and was followed by a 7-day observation period. GM1 was intravenously administered 30 minutes after occlusion and daily during the observation period. Using the reduction in the electroencephalogram amplitude to measure stroke severity, three cats with mild, three cats with moderate, and three cats with severe stroke were treated with 5 mg/kg GM1. Nine cats, three in each group, were treated with 30 mg/kg GM1, while nine cats, three in each group, received middle cerebral artery occlusion but no treatment. In all cats there was a precipitous fall in mean electroencephalogram amplitude during occlusion, followed by a secondary fall during the observation period. Treated cats showed better recovery of electroencephalogram amplitude during the first 4 hours of reperfusion and a smaller secondary fall than untreated cats. Treated cats, especially those treated with 5 mg/kg GM1, showed significant recovery of neurologic deficits compared with untreated cats. Histologic damage was less in treated cats than in untreated cats. Some cats treated with 30 mg/kg GM1 exhibited convulsions, whereas no untreated cat showed any seizure activity. Our findings suggest that gangliosides may improve the recovery of both neurologic deficits and morphologic damage in the central nervous system. These positive effects might be tentatively explained by stimulation of enzymatic activities such as Na+, K+-ATPase and adenyl cyclase.\r"

Of the 965 patients who survived the acute stage of stroke (the first 3 weeks after onset), 941 (505 women and 436 men) were followed for the next 7 years. We analyzed incidence and types of recurrent strokes. During this 7-year follow-up, we recorded 32.1% of the patients as having recurrent strokes, most of which developed in the first 3 years and especially during the first year after the index stroke. The majority of recurrent strokes were of the same type as the index stroke and were localized in the same area of the brain. The cumulative mortality rates for the initial 1,538 patients were 37.3% dead by 3 weeks, 63.6% dead by 3 years, 72.1% dead by 5 years, and 76.5% dead by 7 years. In the first 3 months (excluding the first 3 weeks), most patients who died died of pulmonary thromboembolism. The mortality rate from recurrent strokes and pneumonia was higher than that from cardiovascular mortality. Transient ischemic attacks occurred in 49.5% of all patients and myocardial infarction in 16.4%. Functional prognosis was determined mainly by age, motor function, and concomitant diseases. After 1 year, 68.2% of the surviving patients were fully independent, while 81% of those surviving 7 years had reached this level. A significant number of patients were capable of returning to their previous work.\r"

Six individual criteria were frequent causes for exclusion; however, greater than 80% of the patients were excluded for multiple reasons. Consequently, modifying or eliminating any single criterion did not appreciably increase patient accrual. Only 17 of 210 possible pairs of criteria occurred with statistically significant frequency (p less than 0.05), and these were most likely random associations. Therefore, only by minimizing the number and stringency of enrollment criteria will patient accrual be at a level that allows the study to be completed in a timely manner with a fiscally reasonable number of centers.\r"

Patients were assessed by a neurologist shortly after the onset of the stroke, and computed tomography or autopsy was performed in 96%. The average annual incidence rate for all stroke (cases per 100,000 population per year) was 9.0 (95% confidence interval 5.8-13.4) for males and 8.7 (95% confidence interval 5.5-13.0) for females. The average annual incidence rates for the pathologic types of stroke were 3.4 for cerebral infarction, 3.2 for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 1.9 for intracerebral hemorrhage. The case-fatality ratio was 23.4% at 1 month. Among patients with ischemic strokes, atherosclerosis and cardiac disease accounted for 50% of the cases. Based on angiography or autopsy findings, aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation were demonstrated in 88% of the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 50% of the patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, no cause of bleeding was detected. Our study may supply information about stroke pathologic types in an unselected series of young adults.\r"

In 166 aphasic patients, Broca's aphasia was the most common while Wernicke's and transcortical aphasias were rare. Compared with an older aphasic population, young patients had significantly more nonfluent aphasias and fewer comprehension deficits. These differences were related to stroke localization: the majority of infarcts localized by computed tomography in 37 patients involved either the entire middle cerebral artery territory or its superior or deep branches, explaining the preponderance of nonfluent aphasia. Prognosis of aphasia in our patients was better than has been reported for non-age-selected aphasia populations. Roughly one third of our patients recovered completely, one third improved, and one third had an unresolved language deficit. Complete recovery and significant improvement were observed even greater than 6 months after stroke. In some patients, recovery was much better than might have been predicted from lesion site and size depicted on computed tomograms.\r"

The cerebral hemorrhage was produced in the right basal ganglia by introducing arterial blood via a thin catheter, using the systemic arterial blood pressure of the cat as a driving force. Local cerebral blood volume was measured continuously in the bilateral parietotemporal cortexes employing photoelectric apparatuses. Carbon black dilution curves were recorded from the regions, and the mean transit time of blood was calculated. Local cerebral blood flow was estimated from mean transit time and cerebral blood volume. Intracranial pressure was monitored continuously in the right parietal epidural space. Five minutes after cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial pressure increased by 24.0 +/- 6.1 mm Hg, while mean arterial blood pressure increased by only 2.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. Cerebral blood volume decreased by 1.60 +/- 0.24 vol% in the hemorrhagic and 1.14 +/- 0.30 vol% in the nonhemorrhagic hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow decreased by 30.0 +/- 4.5 ml/100 g brain/min in the hemorrhagic (initially 64.5 +/- 13.6) and by 30.3 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g brain/min in the nonhemorrhagic (initially 60.9 +/- 6.9) hemisphere. Increased intracranial pressure appeared to be the main cause of the observed cerebral blood volume/flow reduction shortly after experimental hemorrhage in the basal ganglia. Several other factors and mechanisms involved are discussed.\r"

Its possible efficacy in attenuating postischemic mortality and neuronal necrosis was examined in gerbils following 3-hour unilateral carotid artery occlusion. Male Mongolian gerbils received two intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or U74006F (3 or 10 mg/kg), the first injection 10 minutes before and the second injection at the end of the 3-hour ischemic episode. In an initial series of experiments, vehicle-treated gerbils displayed 60.9% (14 of 23) survival 24 hours after ischemia, which decreased to 34.8% (8 of 23) at 48 hours. In contrast, the 10 mg/kg U74006F-treated group showed 86.7% (13 of 15) survival at 24 hours (p less than 0.15 vs. vehicle) and 80.0% (12 of 15) survival at 48 hours (p less than 0.02). In a second series, neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the medial and lateral cerebral cortex were counted in gerbils surviving 24 hours after unilateral carotid artery occlusion. Comparison of neuronal densities in the ischemic hemisphere with those in the contralateral nonischemic hemisphere revealed significant neuronal preservation in all three brain regions of 10 mg/kg i.p. x 2 U74006F-treated gerbils. Our results show that U74006F can improve survival and attenuate neuronal necrosis in a severe brain ischemia model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Over a thirty-month period, a wide variety of common urethral problems were treated on an ambulatory basis, with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. When used discriminately, laser treatment appears to be an effective modality for the management of selected urethral strictures. Thus far, excellent results have been obtained in 30 of 31 cases of short strictures where laser urethrotomy was performed as the first stricture procedure (average follow-up 10 months). Furthermore, in a series of 36 cases of secondary bladder neck contractures, all of the evaluated patients responded well (average follow-up 7 months). Good results were obtained in only 11 of 48 complicated strictures (average follow-up 14 months). However, while most of these extensive strictures were not eradicated, laser therapy generally produced a documented clinical improvement, comparable to urethrotomy or dilatation, in 15 of these cases. A series of 24 condylomata involving the urethra were treated satisfactorily, with no recurrences (average follow-up 13 months). Laser treatment also has been used successfully for the management of several urethral caruncles, urethral polyps, two meatal hemangiomas, one urethral carcinoma, and a distal duplicated urethra. Recently, the Nd:YAG laser has been applied to the prostatic urethra with vaporization of obstructing median bar hyperplasia. Favorable results have been achieved in 5 of 6 cases treated with a newly developed technique that utilizes direct laser contact. Retrograde ejaculation has not been encountered in these patients (average follow-up 6 months). All of these procedures have been accomplished in the office, largely without urethral catheterization. Lidocaine jelly occasionally supplemented with intravenous sedation provided satisfactory anesthesia.\r"

The pressures were monitored by attaching the patients' nephrostomy tubes to an electrical pressure transducer. Three of these patients had ureteral stents placed to prevent outflow obstruction from disintegrated stone fragments. The mean pelvic pressure increased from 17.0 cm H2O at the start to 52 cm H2O at the conclusion of ESWL. Two hours post-ESWL, the pressures declined to a mean of 27.0 cm H2O. The maximum pelvic urine volume as determined by aspirating the nephrostomy tubes at the conclusion of the procedure was 6 cc. The observed rise in pelvic pressure may be explained by a sustained contraction of the pelvic smooth musculature.\r"

A comparative investigation was conducted on (2''R)-4'-O-tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (THP) and Adriamycin (ADM) from the above viewpoint using cultured MBT-2 and T-24 cell lines. From in vitro experimental systems, it is surmized that THP is taken up by bladder tumor cells more rapidly than ADM is, and that THP is thus able to exert its effect on the bladder tumor within a shorter time than that required by ADM. This pharmacokinetic advantage of THP was proved in an in vivo experimental system; that is, bladder tumor tissue which was established by implanting MBT-2 cells into the mouse (C3H/He) bladder was found to contain THP in a concentration approximately 1.9 times higher than the concentration of ADM. The amount of systemic absorption from the bladder was small in the case of both THP and ADM. THP should be useful as a new agent for intravesical chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Cases of penetrating ureteral trauma (17 gunshot wounds and 4 stab wounds) seen at two New York City hospitals over a nine-year period were reviewed. Early urologic complications (defined as urine drainage from the wound for greater than 2 weeks or need for a second operation) occurred in 50 percent of patients with a proximal ureteral injury but were less common when a nephrostomy and stent were used in the repair. A similar beneficial effect of stenting was seen in published cases, with a 91 percent complication rate for unstented repairs and a 15 percent rate when stenting and nephrostomy drainage were both used. The effect of stenting on midureteral repairs was less obvious, but the rate of urologic complications was lower in stented cases. None of the patients with distal ureteral injuries suffered a urologic complication. Stenting with and without a nephrostomy tube also produced good results in 2 patients with proximal ureteral injuries diagnosed late. We conclude that repair of penetrating ureteral injuries should include stenting and nephrostomy tube drainage in cases of proximal injuries, as well as generous debridement and water-tight closure. Midureteral injuries accompanied by gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and major vascular injuries should be stented and proximal diversion considered when prosthetic materials are used for vascular repairs.\r"

Indices of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function were measured by M-mode echocardiography before and within 1 minute after termination of 22 episodes of induced tachyarrhythmias by defibrillation (n = 16) and burst pacing (n = 6). The left ventricular septal and posterior endocardial surfaces were digitized immediately below the mitral valve leaflets, and indices of systolic and diastolic function were calculated. The results showed a significant impairment in both systolic and diastolic function after termination of tachyarrhythmias by defibrillation, as seen by a decrease in the shortening fraction (23.7 +/- 7.6% to 19.8 +/- 7.8%; p less than 0.005) and a decline in the peak rate of increase in left ventricular diameter during diastole called dD/dtmax (87.4 +/- 36.1 mm/sec to 71.5 +/- 28.9 mm/sec; p less than 0.01), respectively. In addition, indices of systolic and diastolic function measured at baseline were predictive of impairment in diastolic function, as seen by modest but highly significant correlations between the absolute change in dD/dtmax after defibrillation versus the peak velocity of fiber shortening (r = -0.69; p less than 0.005) and dD/dtmax (r = -0.60; p less than 0.02) measured at baseline. Left ventricular function after termination of tachyarrhythmias by burst pacing was not significantly altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were performed in open-chest, neurally decentralized dogs anesthetized with secobarbital. We determined the dose of propranolol (propranolol dose-response curves) required to block the effects of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 4 Hz bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation on sinus nodal automaticity, AV nodal conduction, and atrial and ventricular ERPs. We found that propranolol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg eliminated ansae subclaviae-induced shortening of atrial and ventricular ERPs, whereas sinus nodal cycle length and AV nodal conduction time still shortened. These data indicate a differential sensitivity of the sinus and AV nodes compared with atrial and ventricular myocardium to the beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects of propranolol in response to efferent sympathetic neural stimulation. Clinical implications are that it might be possible to treat sympathetically mediated ventricular arrhythmias with doses of propranolol that still preserve sinus and AV nodal responses.\r"

Diltiazem plasma levels (mean 120.9 +/- 63.3 ng/ml) were linearly correlated with percentage variations in maximal heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and pressure-rate product during exercise. Eighteen patients in succession discontinued digoxin therapy; after 14 days of diltiazem alone, the 24-hour mean heart rate returned to control values of digoxin therapy, whereas maximal heart rate and pressure-rate product during exercise were significantly reduced (-17.2% and -14.1%, respectively), with no changes in blood pressure. Diltiazem plasma levels (135.0 +/- 83.2 ng/ml) showed a linear correlation with the percentage of reduction in maximal heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that acute myocardial ischemia induces a characteristic temporal variation in regional ultrasound amplitudes. Myocardial ischemia was created by circumflex coronary artery occlusion in seven closed-chest mongrel dogs. Ultrasound images were acquired prior to occlusion and post-occlusion on a phased-array two-dimensional system. Unprocessed ultrasound data from end-diastolic images were taken digitally for quantitative gray level analysis. Temporal variation in ultrasonic gray level of a nonischemic control region was compared to the temporal variation in gray level of the ischemic area. In the ischemic area, the average gray level for all seven dogs increased from 39.2 +/- 4.2 prior to occlusion to 42.5 +/- 4.9 at 15 minutes after occlusion, and then to 44.4 +/- 5.9, 45.3 +/- 6.2, and 47.0 +/- 6.0 at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, respectively (p less than 0.05 for control vs 15 minutes and 15 minutes vs 120 minutes). No significant changes in the average gray level of all seven dogs occurred in the nonischemic area from pre-occlusion to 2 hours post-occlusion (38.8 +/- 8.8, 38.4 +/- 8.0, 37.7 +/- 8.4, 37.8 +/- 8.5, and 38.0 +/- 8.2 for control, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, respectively. These data show that regions of acute myocardial ischemia can be characterized by temporal variation in intramyocardial ultrasonic gray level, not only from the time before coronary occlusion to 15 minutes after occlusion, but also between 15 and 120 minutes in the post-occlusion period. Gray level values in nonischemic regions of the left ventricle are remarkably constant over time.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperemic flow occurs after release of a transient coronary artery occlusion in excess of the acquired oxygen debt if the vessel has sufficient vasodilator reserve. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences exist in the degree of postischemic functional and metabolic recovery in the stunned myocardium when a reactive hyperemia is allowed to occur as opposed to reperfusion in the presence of a flow-limiting coronary artery stenosis. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15-minute episodes of coronary artery occlusion, followed by either 10 minutes (short reperfusion) or 3 hours (long reperfusion) of reperfusion to investigate early and late differences in tissue blood flow. At reperfusion a micrometer-driven occluder was either released fully within 1 minute (full-reactive [FR] group) or the occluder was slowly released to return coronary blood flow to preocclusion levels (no-reactive [NR] group). Areas at risk, myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres), hemodynamics, myocardial segment shortening (sonomicrometry) during occlusion, and high-energy phosphate levels (tissue biopsies) at 3 hours of reperfusion were similar in both groups. Recovery of function in the short-reperfusion group was significantly greater in the FR than the NR group until 3 minutes of reperfusion, which corresponded to the peak reactive hyperemic response. After this time there were no differences between the two groups in functional recovery until 2 and 3 hours after reperfusion when the percentage of segment shortening had deteriorated to a significantly greater extent (p less than 0.05) in the NR group than in the FR group. The reason for this finding may involve prolonged subendocardial ischemia if reperfusion is introduced into a flow-limiting stenosis, as suggested by the greater tissue blood flows in the ischemic reperfused region during early reperfusion in the FR versus NR group. These data suggest that coronary artery patency, in part, determines functional recovery in the stunned myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the efficacy of the perfluorochemical Fluosol-DA 20% for myocardial protection during repeated periods of balloon occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, 25 anesthetized dogs were randomized to receive either oxygenated perfluorochemical, (Fluosol-DA [F]; n = 10) or oxygenated Ringer's lactate (R; n = 6), at the rate of 30 ml/min, during inflation of the balloon. A control group (C; n = 9) received no infusion. A total of eight inflations were performed, each lasting 90 seconds, followed by an equivalent deflation time. Hemodynamics, ECGs, regional myocardial function, and biochemical parameters were studied. Significant differences were noted in ST segment elevation at 90 seconds of inflation in the F (1.5 mm +/- 0.6), C (3.7 mm +/- 0.75), and R (2.9 mm +/- 0.75) groups (F vs C or R p less than 0.05). This was associated with significant improvement in radial shortening in the jeopardized zone at 45 seconds into occlusion in the F group compared to the C and R groups (F = 21.1% +/- 5.1 vs C = 3.5% +/- 4.5 or R = 1.1% +/- 3.2; p less than 0.05). Results of electron microscopy showed reversible changes of ischemia within the mitochondria, and these were most marked in the C and R groups compared to the F group. Endothelial swelling was mild and was present only focally in the R and C groups. Thus perfluorochemicals may enhance the safety and efficacy of balloon angioplasty.\r"

Three phases in developed pressure were noted: (1) volumes from 0 to 150 microliter resulted in a continuous increase in developed pressure; (2) with volumes from 150 to 250 microliter, developed pressure remained constant whereas developed (systolic) and diastolic wall stress rose sharply; and (3) with volumes from 250 to 400 microliter, developed pressure fell whereas developed (systolic) and diastolic wall stress continued to rise. The ln [(PCr)/(Pi)] was in synchrony with oxygen consumption at 0 and 50 microliter balloon volumes, and then diverged at volumes greater than 100 microliter. Oxygen consumption increased from 0 to 50 microliter, was constant from 50 to 250 microliter balloon volume, and then declined. The ln [(PCr)/(Pi)] fell precipitously at balloon volumes greater than 100 microliter, most likely limited by oxygen consumption. Coronary flow did not change significantly until 250 microliter or more of water was added to the balloon, and then it started to decline. Volumes greater than 100 microliter result in overstretch of myofibers, as observed by the precipitous decline in ln [(PCr)/(Pi)], and the steep increase in diastolic wall stress. With excessive volume loading, the drop in phosphorylation potential, ln [(PCr)/(Pi)], appears to contribute to the decrease in developed pressure.\r"

Of 111 patients with blunt chest trauma who were admitted to a large regional shock trauma center and underwent combined first-pass and equilibrium gated RNA, abnormalities were present in 40 (36%). These abnormalities were confined to the right ventricle in 33 patients. There was a positive association between RNA abnormalities and the presence of right bundle branch block (10 of 40, p less than 0.05) and a negative association between RNA abnormalities and the finding of rib fractures (6 of 40, p less than 0.05). The in-hospital death rate of these patients was low (3 of 40 patients with an abnormal RNA and 2 of 71 patients with a normal RNA). Follow-up RNA was performed at 10 +/- 4 days in 26 of the 40 patients with initially abnormal scans, and 22 (85%) of the 26 had reverted to normal. Thus although RNA abnormalities appear common following blunt chest trauma, among patients who survive for more than 24 hours and who undergo subsequent RNA, the complication rate is low despite an abnormal scan. We conclude that routine RNA adds little to clinical management following acute blunt chest trauma.\r"

Cross-linked fibrin degradation products (XDPs) were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay with a specific monoclonal antibody (MabCO Dimertest EIA) that recognizes cross-linked D-dimer fragments and related high molecular weight fibrin derivatives containing D-dimer but that does not cross-react with fibrinogen or its plasmin degradation products. PE was present in 19 with positive pulmonary angiograms and absent in 50 with completely normal lung scans. Elevated levels of XDPs (greater than 144 ng/ml) were present in 17 of 19 patients (89%) with PE and in 28 of 50 (56%) without PE (p = 0.30). Among those with PE present, the XDP levels were (means +/- sd) 864 +/- 1,068 ng/ml (median = 470 ng/ml) compared with 285 +/- 395 ng/ml (median = 155 ng/ml) among those with PE absent (p = 0.003). For PE detection, elevated XDP levels provided a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 44%, a positive predictive value of 38%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and an accuracy of 57%. Among those with elevated XDP levels and PE absent, 75% had no apparent reason for XDP elevations. These data indicate that XDPs are significantly elevated in patients with PE but that, in contrast to earlier reports, measurement of XDPs among individuals with suspected PE may not be sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful in screening.\r"

The rationale is that the septum is shared by the greater and lesser circulation and that in hypertension the latter shows the same qualitative hemodynamic alterations as the former. Among 65 hypertensive patients, 40 (group 1) showed (echo) posterior wall thickness within the mean +/- 1 SD of 62 normal subjects, and 25 (group 2) had a posterior wall thickness exceeding the mean + 1 SD of the normal population. Both groups were subdivided into subgroups A and B, which included patients whose ventricular septum was similar to (within the mean + 1 SD) and thicker than (exceeding the mean + 1 SD) the posterior wall thickness in the corresponding group, respectively. Resting differences in systemic and pulmonary pressure and vascular resistance among subgroups 1A, 1B, and 2A were not significant; however, in subgroup 2B these variables exceeded those in the other subgroups to a significant extent. During cold pressor testing (CPT) the levels reached and the changes in pressure and resistance from baseline values in both circuits were much greater in subgroups B than in subgroups A. The baseline plasma norepinephrine value showed a trend toward an increase from subgroup 1A to 1B and from subgroup 2A and 2B; during CPT norepinephrine invariably changed and in subgroups B it rose significantly more than in subgroups A. It was not determined whether this caused the hemodynamic overload in subgroups B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the comparative extent and severity of the dysfunction related to both forms of ischemia, we studied anesthetized, open-chest dogs by means of two-dimensional echocardiography and tracer microspheres. Supply-type ischemia was produced by total occlusion of the LCx (n = 7); demand-type ischemia was induced by infusion of dobutamine after creation of a critical LCx stenosis (n = 6). At the time of the production of ischemia, the group with demand-type ischemia had significant increases in both heart rate (p less than 0.05) and mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05), whereas the group with supply-type ischemia had a decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05). Subendocardial blood flow in the LCx region was severely depressed in supply-type ischemia (0.09 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm) compared to demand-type ischemia (1.04 +/- 0.07 ml/min/gm; p less than 0.01). Although both groups of animals had an abnormality of left ventricular function during ischemia, as determined by two-dimensional echocardiography, the extent of the dysfunction in the group with supply-type ischemia was greater (146 +/- 12 degrees) compared to the group with demand-type ischemia (99 +/- 9 degrees; p less than 0.01). Similarly, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction in the group with supply-type ischemia was greater than that for the group with demand-type ischemia (p less than 0.05). Thus these data suggest that supply-type ischemia produced by coronary occlusion results in a greater extent and degree of left ventricular functional abnormality than pharmacologically induced demand-type ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical predictors of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) were determined in 760 survivors of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). LVEF was dichotomized at less than or equal to 0.40 (n = 269) and greater than 0.04 (n = 491). Logistic regression showed that 4 of 20 preselected, clinically meaningful variables were strong and independent (p less than 0.001) predictors of LVEF less than or equal to 0.40. Independent variables together with their odds ratio (odds of having a LVEF less than or equal to 0.40 with factor present to odds with factor absent) in order of decreasing importance were: anterior AMI (4.7), congestion on chest x-ray (2.9), previous AMI (2.3) and creatine kinase greater than 1,000 U (2.1). There was a stepwise decrease in LVEF and an increase in the proportion of patients with a low LVEF for each additional clinical variable. A general estimate of LVEF was made by simply considering the total number of clinical factors present. The presence of 0 or 1 clinical variable (n = 466) predicted a high LVEF (greater than 0.40) with an accuracy of 80%. Two or more variables (n = 294) predicted a low LVEF (less than or equal to 0.40) with an accuracy of 60%. The overall predictive accuracy was 72%. Clinically significant major misclassifications were rare (less than 10%). Readily obtainable clinical variables provide the clinician with a useful bedside method of estimating LVEF after AMI.\r"

Group I subjects were those with an ejection fraction greater than 40% (mean 56) and group II subjects were those with an ejection fraction less than 40% (mean 28). Subjects were further classified into those with or without myocardial ischemia (Ia, IIa and Ib, IIb, respectively) based on a treadmill stress test before entry. Work performance during the training sessions was similar for all subgroups, although group IIb had the lowest values for work rate and time of exercise for each individual activity. Subgroup analysis, as determined by a pre- and postprogram treadmill stress test, showed there was no significant difference in time of exercise, peak oxygen consumption and change in submaximal heart rate (decrease) for groups Ia, Ib or IIa. However, group IIb had poor performance in time of exercise (delta = 2 +/- 2 minutes), peak oxygen consumption (delta = 3 +/- 5 ml/min) and submaximal heart rate (delta = 0.4 +/- 17 beats/min) compared with the 3 other subgroups. These subjects also did not demonstrate an improvement of these values in the posttraining period. Patients who have had AMI and have both significant left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial ischemia did not have an adequate training response after 12 weeks of a formal phase II cardiac rehabilitation program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "As many as 30% of patients with chest pain symptoms who are referred for arteriography are found to have normal coronary arteries. Research has shown that patients with anginal symptoms and normal coronary arteries score higher on neuroticism measurements (anxiety, depression and somatic concerns) at the time of catheterization than patients with anginal symptoms who have coronary artery disease. Research examining the cardiac course of chest pain patients with normal coronary arteries indicates that this is a nonprogressive disorder. Although follow-up studies of these patients report continued chest pain and diminished physical activity, these studies have ignored the psychologic status of the patients. Thus, it is not known whether their higher neuroticism scores at the time of catheterization persist following angiography or whether such elevated indexes of neuroticism are transient phenomena associated with precatheterization anticipatory stress. The present study examined 48 Veterans Administration Medical Center patients: 24 with anginal symptoms and normal coronary arteries and 24 with documented coronary artery disease. The patients completed a structured clinical interview and a set of psychologic inventories on the day before catheterization and 1 year later. The findings established continued high neuroticism scores among patients with anginal symptoms only and supported the findings of other investigators regarding continuing chest pain and restricted physical activity. The knowledge alone of benign coronary artery status resulted in virtually no change in the psychosocial status of these patients. Alternative treatment methods are discussed.\r"

Therefore, possible racial differences in the relation of several characteristics to the extent of CAD were assessed in 4,722 white and 169 black men who underwent arteriography. Associations between an occlusion score (ranging from 0 to 300), reflecting the severity of CAD, and levels of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, relative weight, systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were examined. Most risk factors were significantly related to the extent of CAD in both races, but lipid levels showed stronger associations with CAD among blacks: correlations between CAD and total cholesterol were 0.16 (whites) vs 0.29 (blacks) and associations with HDL cholesterol were -0.22 (whites) vs -0.49 (blacks). In addition, at adverse levels of certain risk factors, blacks had more extensive CAD than did whites: mean occlusion scores were 148 (whites) and 238 (blacks) at HDL cholesterol levels less than 30 mg/dl. As assessed by multiple linear regression, however, only triglyceride levels were differentially related to CAD between whites (beta = 0) and blacks (beta = 0.47), p less than 0.01 for racial contrast. These results document the importance of risk factors in black men and indicate black/white differences in the relation of triglycerides to CAD.\r"

Transesophageal electrophysiologic evaluation was performed after birth or at the time of PAT occurrence in the prenatal CHF group and at the time of CHF diagnosis in the postnatal CHF group. Before the electrophysiologic study, spontaneous PAT onset and termination were observed in all prenatal CHF neonates. In the postnatal CHF neonates, however, a single, prolonged episode of PAT was observed. During PAT, all neonates were observed to have a regular heart rate, normal QRS morphology and ventriculoatrial interval exceeding 80 ms. These findings suggested an orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia using an accessory atrioventricular connection as the tachycardia mechanism. In the 12 neonates with prenatal CHF, the PAT cycle length measured 243 +/- 30 ms, whereas in the 12 neonates with postnatal CHF it measured 208 +/- 19 ms (p less than 0.003). Neonates with prenatal CHF secondary to PAT appear to develop CHF from multiple PATs recurring at relatively long cycle lengths (slow heart rates), whereas postnatal CHF neonates develop heart failure symptoms during a sustained tachycardia episode with relatively short cycle lengths (fast heart rates).\r"

Patients with a high resting ejection fraction had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with patients with normal resting ejection fraction (182 mm Hg vs 169, p less than 0.01, and 110 vs 103, p less than 0.05, respectively), markedly greater echocardiographic LV mass (136 vs 94 g/m2, p less than 0.01), smaller ventricular dimensions in systole (2.5 vs 3.1, p less than 0.01) and diastole (4.4 vs 4.9, p less than 0.05), and higher relative wall thickness (0.61 +/- 0.20 vs 0.39 +/- 0.98, p less than 0.001). Patients with supranormal resting ventricular performance had lower end-systolic wall stress than normal volunteers or patients with normal resting LV function (48 vs 64 vs 74 X 10(3) dynes/cm2, respectively). Patients with an elevated LV ejection fraction also had significantly more abnormal funduscopic examinations and greater proteinuria. Thus, a subset of essential hypertensive patients with moderately to severely elevated blood pressure developed marked concentric LV hypertrophy associated with subnormal end-systolic stress and supranormal LV performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of reconstructive procedures was determined for each of the various patient subsets. Overall hospital mortality was 5.6% in the series: 8.4% for mitral replacement compared with 3% for mitral valvuloplasty (p = 0.007). Among patients undergoing primary isolated mitral procedures, hospital mortality for replacement was 7.5% compared with 1.4% for valvuloplasty (p = 0.018).

Compared to both uncomplicated MVP and normal subjects, patients with MVP plus MR were older (p less than 0.05), had strikingly large mitral leaflets and anulus (p less than 0.0005) and were more likely to have systolic billowing of mitral leaflets in the parasternal long-axis view (24 of 26 [92%] vs 24 of 48 subjects with uncomplicated MVP [50%], p less than 0.001). Overlap in anular and posterior leaflet dimensions in normal and uncomplicated MVP subjects occurred in the 20 MVP plus MR patients who continue to be followed medically but not in the 6 MVP plus MR patients who underwent mitral valve surgery during 22 +/- 14 months follow-up. Patients with MR due to rheumatic or other non-MVP etiologies had enlargement of mitral leaflets and anulus virtually identical to that in MVP plus MR patients. In conclusion, patients with severe MR due to MVP are older, have striking mitral valve enlargement and more frequently exhibit leaflet billowing compared with subjects with uncomplicated MVP. Similar mitral leaflet enlargement was found in patients with non-MVP etiologies of MR, suggesting that mitral anular and leaflet enlargement may play a more general role in the pathogenesis of MR than is currently appreciated.\r"

After a selection of 29 intact mitral valves excised at cardiac surgery from patients with a mitral valve area less than or equal to 1.5 cm2 was made, double balloon mitral valvotomy was attempted in 14 valves using two 20-mm diameter balloon catheters (group 1) and single balloon mitral valvotomy using a 20-mm balloon was undertaken in 15 valves (group 2). In group 1 the mitral valve area increased from 0.9 +/- 0.03 to 1.9 +/- 0.05 cm2 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (p less than 0.001), with a mean anterior commissural split of 5.3 +/- 0.2 mm and a posterior split of 4.1 +/- 0.2 mm.

Ten mitral valves from group 2 underwent a second dilatation using the double balloon technique and the mitral valve area increased further from 1.2 +/- 0.06 to 1.9 +/- 0.06 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Overall, commissural splitting occurred preferentially in calcified commissures (81%), as opposed to only 56% of noncalcified commissures.

The mean aortic gradient decreased from 66 +/- 23 to 40 +/- 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and the mean valve area increased from 0.5 +/- 0.17 to 0.7 +/- 0.26 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Although the aortic gradient determined by both Doppler and direct measurement correlated well before PAV, the Doppler gradients determined 24 +/- 48 hours after the procedure were significantly higher than the directly measured gradients at the time of PAV. Ninety-two percent of patients were New York Heart Association class III or IV before PAV. Of the remaining 12 patients, 6 (50%) were classified as class II, 2 (17%) were class III, and 4 were (33%) class IV. Necropsy examination of the patient who died shortly after valvuloplasty revealed localized hematoma and tear in the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Smaller initial valve areas yielded smaller valve areas after PAV. Patients with greater valve areas following PAV showed greater functional improvement. Only 7 patients (29%) had at least 1 functional class improvement at the final follow-up. PAV can be performed relatively safely in elderly, moribund patients, although sustained improvement of functional status is not common. In this population, PAV should be limited to patients severely symptomatic in whom surgery is not an acceptable option.\r"

Progressive conduction abnormalities were common (82%). QTc interval and QRS- and T-wave axes did not change. In 50 patients with electrocardiograms within 60 days of death, total 12-lead QRS and V1 through V6 QRS amplitude correlated better with heart weight (r = 0.51, p less than 0.0001 and r = 0.55, p less than 0.0001) than the Estes-Romhilt score did. The mean total 12-lead QRS amplitude was 138 mm with a mean of 106 for V1 through V6. In 31 patients cardiac mass index was calculated and showed significant correlation with 12-lead and V1 through V6 QRS amplitudes (r = 0.68, p less than 0.0001 and r = 0.75, p less than 0.0001, respectively). The QRS amplitudes remained constant during the illness. By using total 12-lead QRS or frontal plane QRS amplitude, heart weight can be predicted as early as 2 years before death. Use of body surface area and QRS amplitude criteria increases the accuracy of heart weight prediction. Thus, progressive electrocardiographic changes are common in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and QRS amplitude criteria are more accurate in the prediction of left ventricular hypertrophy than standard criteria.\r"

Additional findings included asynergic ventricular areas (64%), left ventricular \"hypertrophy\" sometimes reversible (20%), hyperrefractile myocardial areas (23%), ventricular thrombi (15%) and \"restrictive\" ventricular filling (7%). It is concluded that echocardiographic features of myocarditis are polymorphous and nonspecific. The echocardiographic pattern can simulate alternatively dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive or \"right\" ventricular cardiomyopathy, as well as coronary artery disease. In an appropriate clinical context, echocardiography can be helpful in the diagnosis of myocarditis and in the selection of patients for endomyocardial biopsy.\r"

Previous work has been criticized because of the techniques used for measuring LV mass, the variable level of training of the subjects recruited and the methods used to normalize the data. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, LV mass was determined using the very accurate and reproducible technique of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Highly trained competitive athletes including cross-country skiers, endurance cyclists and long distance runners (VO2max = 77 +/- 1, 72 +/- 2 and 75 +/- 2 ml (kg X min)-1, respectively) were examined. The data were normalized for body weight, body surface area and lean body mass. LV mass was significantly greater in skiers (239 +/- 9 g), runners (244 +/- 10 g) and cyclists (258 +/- 11 g) when compared with nonathletic control subjects (189 +/- 6 g) (p less than 0.001), which represents percent differences of 26, 29 and 37%, respectively. LV mass remained greater in the athletes, regardless of the method used to normalize the data. In addition, there was a good correlation between LV mass and VO2max (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). It was concluded that LV mass is significantly greater in highly trained competitive endurance athletes and that normalizing LV mass with respect to body weight, body surface area or lean body mass does not alter this relation.\r"

Started in 1972, it recently served greater than 3.4 million persons monthly and at a cost of $1.66 billion annually. The National WIC Evaluation (NWE) consisted of four studies: The historical study estimated changes in birth outcome attributable to WIC from 1972 to 1980 in 19 states and the District of Columbia from WIC program data and vital statistics. The longitudinal study of pregnant women compared dietary intake, weight gain, anthropometry, duration of gestation, birth weight, and infant length and head circumference between a representative national sample of WIC participants and economically comparable women. The cross-sectional study of preschool children related WIC to dietary intake, anthropometry, and psychological development. The food expenditures study estimated the impact of WIC on family grocery and other food expenditures.\r"

Despite many uncertainties, the probable range of reduction in the rate of low birth weight was approximately 1-2% and the increase in mean birth weight ranged from 0 to approximately 60 g. There was too little information to securely estimate effects of WIC on perinatal and infant mortality nor on the dietary intake of women or children. Although the number of studies was small, there probably were important effects of WIC on rates of childhood anemia. There is too little evidence to come to any conclusion on effects during pregnancy. There is little evidence that the WIC program has affected children's linear growth.\r"

WIC was associated with increased first trimester prenatal care (4.1%, p less than 0.001), decreased inadequate prenatal care (-5.0%, p less than 0.001), longer duration of gestation (0.20 d, p less than 0.05), decreased preterm delivery (-0.92%, p less than 0.05) and increased birth weight (23 g, p less than 0.01). After autocorrelation was accounted for, significance levels for birth weight and frequency of preterm delivery were 0.05 less than p less than 0.10. Including counties with incomplete time series data, the estimated effect on birth weight was 23.9 g (p = 0.004) and on decreased fetal mortality was -2.3/1000 (p = 0.04). Among those with less than 12 y schooling, whites had a 1.8% reduction in preterm birth (p less than 0.05) and blacks a 2.0% reduction (p less than 0.05). The estimated effect on birth weight for less-educated whites was 46.6 g (p less than 0.001). The predominant effects of WIC were on improved physiologic status of the mother and fetus.\r"

The women completed 24-h dietary recalls, histories of food expenditures, health care utilization, health and sociodemographic status, and anthropometric assessment. At late-pregnancy follow-up 3,967 WIC and 1043 control women were interviewed and 853 WIC and 762 control women completed 1-wk food expenditure diaries. Birth outcome was abstracted (from hospital records) for 3,863 WIC and 1058 control women. Anthropometry, dietary intake, health, and use of health services were related to WIC among 2,619 random low-income preschoolers. Psychological development was assessed in 526 children aged 4 and 5 y. Control women had higher income, education, and employment status; therefore, WIC program benefits probably were underestimated.\r"

Incremental energy intake was comparable to that in most small-scale supplementation trials. There was no evidence of effects on frequency of prenatal care, use of alcohol or tobacco, the intention to breast-feed, or the rate of breast-feeding. Maternal alcohol intake was associated with depressed infant head circumference, over and above effects on birth weight and length.\r"

It is efficacious in the management of acute or chronic renal failure complicated by fluid overload, and following surgery. In this study, cardiac filling pressures, cardiac indices, and BP were monitored in nine patients. A mean of 7 kg of fluid was removed in ten treatments without the induction of hypotension. In nine of ten treatments, cardiac index increased following fluid removal. An increment in myocardial pump function was noted even in patients with low output heart failure. This treatment differs from dialysis in its ability to remove large fluid volumes without compromising cardiac hemodynamics. In addition, CAVH may have a role in treating volume overload patients with renal insufficiency and heart failure resistant to pharmacologic intervention.\r"

To see if serum potassium is increased at more modest elevations of the platelet count we studied these parameters in 283 controls and 161 patients with reactive thrombocytosis. The incidence of hyperkalemia was 34% in patients with over 500 x 10(9) platelets/L compared with 9% if the platelet count was below 250 x 10(9)/L. Over this range there was a significant correlation of potassium increasing with the platelet count. The higher potassium values could not be explained on the basis of leukocytosis, renal insufficiency, or acidosis, suggesting that the elevated serum levels were often spurious. In support of this conclusion, the serum potassium exceeded plasma potassium by a larger amount in patients with thrombocytosis. We conclude that serum potassium rises in direct proportion to the platelet count in normal patients and in those with thrombocytosis, and that this increment is an artifact.\r"

Hemodialysis raised the serum sodium to 118 mEq/L, and the serum osmolality to 284 mosm/kg, while lowering the osmolal gap to 26 mosm/kg. The presence of severe hyponatremia with only modest hypoosmolality may occur in patients with renal failure following the systemic absorption of hypotonic fluids containing solutes such as sorbitol and mannitol. Hemodialysis offers the advantages of correcting the hyponatremia while removing the unmeasured solute, thus preventing rapid increases in the serum osmolality.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was carried out to clarify whether an oral sorbent, AST-120 (Kureha Chemical Ind Co, Tokyo), may postpone the initiation of dialysis therapy. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, control and AST. The AST group consisted of 27 undialyzed uremic patients. Serum creatine concentrations (SCr) were 4.3 to 8.1 mg/dL (5.8 +/- 1.1 mg/dL, mean +/- SD). The control group consisted of 24 uremic patients who were not given AST-120 during the conservative therapy period before the initiation of hemodialysis. AST-120 (3.2 to 7.2 g/d) was administered to the patients in the AST group for 2.4 to 30.1 months (13.2 +/- 7.4) before the initiation of hemodialysis. The slopes of reciprocal creatinine v time in the control group were -1,251 +/- 856 x 10(-5) dL/mg/month during the 6 to 12 months before the initiation of dialysis therapy, and in the AST group, they were -1,004 +/- 1,012 x 10(-5) dL/mg/month before administration, and -347 +/- 509 x 10(-5) dL/mg/month after administration of AST-120 (P less than 0.01). All 24 patients in the control group and 21 of 27 in the AST group were introduced to hemodialysis. SCr and serum urea nitrogen (SUN) at the initiation of hemodialysis did not differ between the control and AST group: 10.8 +/- 2.6 and 11.0 +/- 2.2 mg/dL and 92.7 +/- 22.2 and 94.1 +/- 21.6 mg/dL, respectively. The times to the 50% undialyzed level were 5.0 months in the control group, and 14.3 months in the AST group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The human chromosomal assignments of genes of the creatine kinase (CK) family--loci for brain (CKBB), muscle (CKMM), and mitochondrial (CKMT) forms--were studied by Southern filter hybridization analysis of DNAs isolated from a human x rodent somatic cell hybrid clone panel. Probes for the 3'-noncoding sequences of human CKBB and CKMM hybridized concordantly only to DNAs from somatic cell hybrids containing chromosomes 14 and 19, respectively. Thus the earlier assignment of the gene coding for the CKBB isozyme to chromosome 14 was confirmed by molecular means, as was the provisional assignment of CKMM to the long arm of chromosome 19. A probe containing canine sequences for CKMM cross-hybridized with human sequences on chromosomes 14 and 19, a result consistent with the assignments of CKBB and CKMM. A probe containing human sequences for CKMT enabled the provisional assignment of CKMT to human chromosome 15. Independent hybrids with portions of the long arm of chromosome 19 missing indicated the order of genes on the long arm of chromosome 19 as being cen-GPI-(TGFB, CYP1)-[CKMM, (APOC2-ERCC1)]-(CGB, FTL). The unexpectedly more distal location of APOC2 among the genes on the long arm--and APOC2's close association with CKMM--is discussed with respect to the close linkage relationship of APOC2 to myotonic muscular dystrophy.\r"

The ORM1 5 band was always observed together with the ORM1 2 band. The simultaneous expression could be explained in terms of an additional duplicated ORM1 locus haplotype, ORM1*5.2, whose average frequency was .016 in two Japanese populations. The ORM2*6 found at a polymorphic frequency (.023) was demonstrated to be in association with ORM1*2, indicating the close proximity between ORM1 and ORM2 loci.\r"

Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels supplemented with 2 M urea could clearly discriminate three different patterns in each of the two homomeric dimers, FXIIIA 1 and FXIIIA 2. These patterns can be explained by the existence of two codominant subtypes in each of the two common alleles, FXIIIA*1 and FXIIIA*2. These subtypes are termed FXIIIA*1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, respectively. In random population samples of Japanese, all the possible phenotypes deduced from the four codominant alleles were observed except for the FXIIIA 2A homozygote with the least frequency. This hypothesis is compatible with the segregation study on 35 family samples. The frequencies of the four alleles were calculated in 433 unrelated Japanese as being .2748 for FXIIIA*1A, .6201 for FXIIIA*1B, .0069 for FXIIIA*2A, and .0982 for FXIIIA*2B. The data obtained in this study will contribute much more to disputed paternity cases and to anthropological surveys than will the former FXIIIA system with two common alleles.\r"

A multistage random sampling procedure was used, and information was obtained from all ever-married women in the household about their reproductive performance and genealogical relationship with spouse; demographic and socioeconomic information was also recorded. Twenty-five percent of all marriages were between relatives, and the spouses were first cousins in approximately 57% of all consanguineous marriages. Total pregnancies, live births, and living children were significantly higher among consanguineous couples than among nonconsanguineous ones, as was the proportion dead among children ever born. However, no difference remained in either fertility or mortality, when allowance was made for socioeconomic status, religious affiliation, and marriage duration. The issue of confounding is discussed, and the lack of significant pattern in the final analysis is interpreted as resulting from a long-term practice of consanguineous marriages.\r"

The emphasis throughout the paper is on exposition, using simple examples to illustrate certain principles or properties. A discussion follows the presentation of the two methods. The calculation of the paternity index is based on the genotype (or phenotype) of the accused man; and the value of the paternity index remains the same whether the accusation itself is true or false.\r"

Bone mineral content in the forearms was measured by single-photon absorptiometry, and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and total-body bone mineral by dual-photon absorptiometry, before and after one and two years of treatment. At the end of the two years, there were highly significant differences of 6 to 7 percent between the estrogen and the placebo groups at all sites measured. The range of the changes of the spine measurement was twice that of the forearm and total-body measurements. It is concluded that measurement of the forearm by single-photon absorptiometry is superior to measurement of the spine by dual-photon absorptiometry both in clinical studies and in the individual patient for detecting estrogen-dependent bone loss and its treatment by estrogen replacement.\r"

Twenty-five patients with the hungry bone syndrome were identified (12.6 percent). Compared to patients with uncomplicated metabolic responses to parathyroid surgery, these patients were older by a mean of 10 years; they had higher preoperative serum levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, N-terminal parathyroid hormone, and blood urea nitrogen; and their resected parathyroid adenomata were larger. The mean duration of hospitalization averaged three days longer in the group with hungry bone disease. Stepwise multivariate analysis of preoperative variables enabled the development of a discriminant function for prediction of postoperative hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Identified predictive variables were volume of resected parathyroid adenoma, blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and age. When validated on an independent patient population, these readily obtainable preoperative clinical and laboratory parameters will allow identification of a subgroup of patients who are at greater risk for the development of the hungry bone syndrome following parathyroid surgery.\r"

To determine if the length of stay accounts for this risk, daily infection rates were computed per decade of life and rates for patients over and under 60 were compared using risk ratios. Four thousand thirty-one nosocomial infections in 2,567 patients were identified for a 1980 through 1984 admission cohort in an acute-care hospital. The daily infection rates were 0.59 percent in patients over age 60 and 0.40 percent in younger patients (relative risk = 1.49). The daily incidences of urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and septicemias were all significantly increased in elderly patients with risk ratios of 2.78, 2.07, and 1.36, respectively. Further analysis revealed that elderly patients experienced significantly more nosocomial infections for each day of hospitalization after Day 7. These data show that elderly patients experience an increased daily rate of nosocomial infection, and suggest that efforts be directed at identifying clinical conditions that predispose this population to hospital-acquired infections.\r"

A total of 502 central intravascular catheters were prospectively collected from 362 consecutive patients in the adult intensive care units. Semiquantitative and broth cultures were performed on distal and proximal catheter segments, with peripheral blood culture specimens drawn in febrile patients. The overall infection rate for the 502 catheters was 11.8 percent or 2.2 infections per 100 days at risk. The infection rates were: single-lumen lines, 8 percent; triple-lumen lines, 32 percent; and triple-lumen pulmonary artery catheters, 12 percent. When corrected for time at risk, the triple-lumen lines and the triple-lumen pulmonary artery catheters had the same rate of infection, which was three times greater than that of the single-lumen catheters. After correction for confounding variables such as the presence of diabetes mellitus, the use of hyperalimentation, the degree of illness, dialysis, or ultrafiltration, and the use of a guide wire to place a replacement line over a pre-existing one, the risk of infection remained significantly higher for triple-lumen than for single-lumen catheters. The use of a guide wire to place a new line over an old one also was associated with a trend towards an increased risk of infection.\r"

Two additional patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia were given maintenance therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin G every 21 days for previously recurrent AIHA and infections. Hematocrit levels of patients with AIHA stabilized followed by a gradual improvement at 21 days after intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion without steroids. Treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin G resulted in faster and higher increments in hematocrit levels in these patients. Other patients who had partial responses to steroids showed further improvement in their hematocrit levels by the addition of intravenous immunoglobulin G. Another patient with a cold agglutinin disease was refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy. Five patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute AIHA and two patients with previous recurrences of AIHA required maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin G every 21 days. All seven patients except one did not have any episodes of AIHA from six months to as long as four years while receiving the three-week intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy. These observations indicate a role for intravenous immunoglobulin G in the management of IgG-mediated but not IgM-associated autoimmune hemolysis in immunocompromised patients with lymphoproliferative diseases.\r"

  ".W": "A 35-year-old woman with severe (less than 1 percent) factor VII deficiency had recurrent hemarthroses involving the left knee, leading to deformity, pain, and virtually complete loss of function. It was elected to perform a total knee replacement. In preparation for surgery, the patient received heat-treated prothrombin complex concentrate containing 870 units of factor VII per vial. A dose of 50 U/kg raised the factor VII level to 115 percent. At surgery, dense adhesions were found within the joint, the articular cartilage was overgrown with pannus extending out to the lateral patella, and there was extensive deformity of the femoral condyle and tibial plateau. The joint was excised and replaced by a cemented Microloc prosthesis. Postoperatively, factor VII levels were maintained above 10 percent by six-hourly infusions of concentrate. Beginning on Day 4, single daily infusions of 25 U/kg were given prior to physical therapy. No bleeding occurred, and the patient was ambulating at the time of discharge 20 days postoperatively. This experience indicates that despite its short half-life (less than four hours), factor VII levels sufficient to prevent bleeding can be maintained in factor VII-deficient patients undergoing major operative procedures.\r"

One half of the patients in each arm required changes in the antibiotic regimen because of side effects, persistent fever with a site suspicious for infection, resistant organisms, or breakthrough bacteremias. Forty patients (95 percent) receiving cefoperazone and mezlocillin and 43 patients (93 percent) receiving imipenem/cilastatin recovered from the neutropenic episode. Two patients in each regimen group died of their underlying disease. One patient in the imipenem/cilastatin arm died of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. Although the two regimens are comparable in efficacy, the incidence of side effects favored the cefoperazone and mezlocillin group.

Likewise, the two regimens were equally effective against those infections in which the pathogen could be determined (82 percent versus 82 percent). Serum bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 against a known pathogen were associated with a higher response rate than were titers of less than 1:32, but the higher dose regimen did not result in higher serum bactericidal titers. Hypoprothrombinemia was a side effect, especially with the higher dose regimen, before prophylactic vitamin K was routinely administered to patients. Since there were no major benefits with the use of the higher dose regimen of mezlocillin plus cefoperazone, the lower dose regimen is more appropriate for routine usage.\r"

The initial dose reduced the inoculum by approximately 3 logs for the Pseudomonas and the staphylococci and 3 to 5 logs for the other organisms. No significant differences in killing were found between the 2- and 4-g doses. Regrowth of Pseudomonas and staphylococci occurred with the single dose but not with the every-12-hour regimen. These data support the clinical use of cefoperazone in doses every 12 hours.\r"

The primary objective in treating nocturnal asthma is to help patients sleep through the night. The bronchoconstriction that underlies nocturnal asthmatic symptoms is a reflection of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and this hyperresponsiveness is greatly increased by airway inflammation. In patients with allergic asthma, airway inflammation can be reduced by reducing exposure to allergens and, in some cases, by immunotherapy. Nocturnal bronchoconstriction is best controlled by scheduling sustained-release bronchodilators, particularly theophylline, to provide the maximal theophylline blood concentration at the time of maximal obstruction, usually between 4:00 and 6:00 A.M.\r"

This article reviews the many factors (allergen exposure, sleep, airway cooling, diminished clearance of mucous secretions) that have been identified as contributing to nocturnal asthma. Also discussed are recent data suggesting that diurnal variations in hormone concentrations and in autonomic nervous system control are possible mechanisms of nocturnal asthma. Decreased epinephrine secretion and increased vagal tone during sleep not only cause airway obstruction but may also enhance bronchial reactivity. These changes in the modulation of airway smooth muscle tone produce bronchial obstruction, which, in turn, accentuates ventilation-perfusion mismatch and increases hypoxia.\r"

Recent studies suggest that theophylline pharmacodynamics vary among asthmatic patients. However, on average, most of the total bronchodilatory response occurs at serum theophylline concentrations of 0 to 10 mg/liter. Additional (but less) bronchodilatation occurs at serum theophylline levels between 10 and 20 mg/liter. Pharmacodynamic relationships are not well established for other therapeutic effects of theophylline, such as attenuation of pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction. An important feature of oral controlled-release theophylline therapy is timing of drug administration. Because airway reactivity increases and airway caliber decreases at night, it has been suggested that the greatest benefit is derived from theophylline when peak serum concentration is reached during the night or the early morning.\r"

Seventy-four percent of the 7,729 patients who participated reported awakening at night at least once a week, and 64 percent reported awakening at least three times a week. Of 3,015 patients who regarded their asthma as mild, 26 percent reported awakening every night, suggesting that many patients underestimate the severity of their asthma. Patients with no nocturnal asthma generally had a lower frequency of allergic and nonallergic trigger factors, but no dominant feature distinguished these patients from those who did awaken at night. As perceived asthma severity increased, so did the number of drug types being prescribed, but no particular drug was identified as being associated with a lower frequency of nocturnal asthma. The frequency of nocturnal asthma found in the survey population (74 percent), in which 48 percent of the patients were using corticosteroid aerosols, was identical to that found in a survey conducted in 1971, when this medication was not yet available. Even though the sampling methods used in the two surveys were different, this finding indicates that the introduction of aerosol steroids has had little effect on the frequency of nocturnal asthma. Current use of existing medication alone may not eliminate the problem of nocturnal asthma, and new drugs and/or new dosing strategies may be needed to control this disabling symptom completely.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to review briefly the published data on the North American experience with evening administration of the once-daily theophylline preparation, Uniphyl tablets. An increasing body of data demonstrates that this regimen produces peak concentrations of theophylline in the blood during the early morning hours, the time of maximal benefit for patients with nocturnal asthma. These data also show that once-daily Uniphyl administered in the evening is superior to both a once-daily morning Uniphyl schedule and to a conventional twice-daily sustained-release theophylline preparation in reducing early morning bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Atheroma as a cause of renal failure has been largely overlooked. We wanted to report our experience with atheromatous renal disease over a 12-year period. PATIENTS and METHODS: Observations on 32 cases of various forms of renal failure in patients with atheromatous renal disease are presented. These patients had been hypertensive for an average of 10.2 +/- 9.2 years. The length of deterioration was an average of 17 months, and at presentation renal insufficiency was severe, with serum creatinine levels of (mean +/- SD) 616 +/- 358 mumol/liter (6.8 +/- 4.0 mg/dl). At this stage, the clinical picture was indistinguishable from other common causes of chronic renal failure in the elderly. Thus, the precise diagnosis would have been overlooked without an aggressive diagnostic workup. All patients underwent angiography and six patients underwent renal biopsy. RESULTS: In 22 cases, renal insufficiency was mainly due to atheromatous stenosis of renal arteries. In six of six patients, the results of renal biopsy showed cholesterol crystal embolism. In four additional cases, there was clinical or histologic evidence of extrarenal cholesterol embolism. In eight, renal artery plaques coexisted with cholesterol embolism. In two patients, renal failure was due only to cholesterol embolism. Renal atheromatous stenoses were developing, as shown on serial angiographies performed in five cases. In seven cases, stenoses involved both the main trunks of renal arteries and several intrarenal branches of too small a diameter to allow reconstructive surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. In addition, the general condition of most patients was so poor as to preclude surgery. Dialysis was begun in 11 patients, four other patients died, and renal failure was managed conservatively in 11. When undertaken, reconstructive surgery was successful in five of six patients. CONCLUSIONS: Atheromatous renal disease is a frequent and easily overlooked cause of chronic renal insufficiency. It is not only due to renal artery stenosis but also to complex intrarenal lesions, with multiple stenoses of intrarenal vasculature and cholesterol embolism. It should be diagnosed by early angiography and renal biopsy, before the stage of multivisceral complications and at a time when surgery can still be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is now diagnosed frequently in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) living in the central United States. Previous review articles of AIDS have failed to mention this infection. Herein, we describe 48 AIDS patients with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in an effort to better understand the clinical presentation and diagnosis of the condition in this setting and to assess the efficacy of antifungal chemotherapy. PATIENTS and METHODS: In the Houston metropolitan area, there were 66 cases of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis among 1,300 confirmed cases of AIDS from January 1983 to July 1987. Of AIDS patients in East Texas with histoplasmosis, 16 patients were available for follow-up by one of us, and the histories of 32 were obtained by examination of hospital charts and physician records. RESULTS: Fever, weight loss, and splenomegaly were the most common presenting signs and symptoms, occurring in 81, 52, and 31 percent, respectively. One-third of the patients had hematologic abnormalities. Infiltrates on chest roentgenograms were observed in 52 percent. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis was the initial manifestation of AIDS in almost three-fourths of our patients. Biopsy and culture of the bone marrow established the diagnosis of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in 69 percent. Clinical or autopsy proof of relapse occurred in three patients despite an initial course of more than 2 g of amphotericin B chemotherapy followed by ketoconazole suppression. CONCLUSION: Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is often the first sign of immunodeficiency in patients with AIDS, and the diagnosis of this condition is most often established by bone marrow biopsy and culture. Because of the permanence of the immunodeficient state in these patients, progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is resistant to treatment.\r"

The following information was obtained from all 35 patients: age, service, date of hospital admission, date of the bacteremia, underlying diseases, initial antimicrobial therapy, focus of infection, the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobial susceptibility of the blood isolate, and outcome. RESULTS: All 35 patients were men, had a mean age of 69 years, and all had one or more underlying diseases; 45 percent had a malignancy. The duration of time between a pair of episodes was four weeks or more for 74 percent of 38 pairs of episodes. In 25 of 38 (66 percent) pairs of episodes, the focus of infection was the same; in 80 percent of these 25 pairs, the urinary tract was the focus. Overall, the urinary tract was the focus of gram-negative bacteremia in almost 50 percent. Escherichia coli was the single most common organism isolated (28 percent of all episodes), followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5 percent) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5 percent). Six of 35 (17 percent) patients died due to gram-negative bacteremia; five of these six had a respiratory tract focus of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of veterans, recurrent gram-negative bacteremia was identified in almost 10 percent of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia during a 37-month study period. Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia most frequently occurred in the setting of underlying malignancy with the urinary tract as a common focus of infection. The mortality rate of 17 percent was similar to that of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia reported in previous studies.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: An increased incidence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has recently been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, other risk factors for community-acquired S. aureus bacteremia (including intravenous drug abuse and lymphedema) were present in nearly all these AIDS-related cases of S. aureus infection. Our purpose was to review cases of S. aureus bacteremia that occurred in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) who did not have a recent history of intravenous drug use, lymphatic obstruction, or neutropenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients at San Francisco General Hospital between October 1984 and October 1987 with blood culture results positive for S. aureus were identified. A review of this group revealed 22 cases of S. aureus bacteremia that occurred in 18 patients with an underlying diagnosis of AIDS or ARC, none of whom had a recent history of intravenous drug use, lymphedema secondary to Kaposi's sarcoma, or neutropenia. RESULTS: An intravenous catheter was the single most important risk factor for S. aureus bacteremia and was identified as the source for bacteremia in 16 (73 percent) of the 22 episodes. Based on 1986 outpatient clinic records, we calculated an incidence of S. aureus bacteremia occurring in non-intravenous-drug-using male AIDS or ARC patients, 18 to 44 years old, that was 5.4 episodes/1,000 patients. Although the mean duration of appropriate antibiotic therapy was 18 days, late metastatic complications of S. aureus bacteremia occurred in six (35 percent) of 17 AIDS/ARC patients who survived initial antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: Non-intravenous-drug-using AIDS and ARC patients (especially those with indwelling venous catheters) appear to be at high risk for S. aureus bacteremia, with a higher late metastatic complication rate than that reported for recent historical control subjects.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In order to clarify the significance of anginal pain and myocardial thallium-201 scan defects in cardiac sarcoidosis, the pharmacologic effect of dipyridamole on myocardial perfusion was assessed by planar thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy in patients with sarcoidosis. PATIENTS and METHODS: Thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy was performed at rest and after 0.56 mg/kg intravenous dipyridamole during four minutes in 16 patients with sarcoidosis. The myocardial scan (45-degree and 70-degree left anterior oblique, and anterior views) was divided into 15 segments. Results were evaluated by the number of segmental defects and with a global perfusion score (from 0 to 60) by a semi-quantitative index depending on the size and severity of myocardial thallium-201 defects. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 16 patients showed partial or total reversion of their thallium-201 defects on redistribution scanning either at rest or after dipyridamole. The mean (+/- SD) number of myocardial perfusion defects that were present in all the patients decreased from 5.31 +/- 1.78 at rest to 3.25 +/- 2.52 after redistribution (p less than 0.001) and to 2.19 +/- 2.10 after dipyridamole (p less than 0.001). The mean global perfusion score increased from 53.2 +/- 3.0 at rest to 56.2 +/- 2.9 after redistribution (p less than 0.001) and to 57.2 +/- 2.7 after dipyridamole (p less than 0.001). A significant correlation (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001) was found between the increase of global perfusion score on redistribution and after dipyridamole. CONCLUSION: The reversibility of myocardial scan defects is a common finding in sarcoidosis. It makes unlikely the role of scar fibrosis or extensive confluent granulomas as a mechanism for such defects. The effect of dipyridamole suggests the presence of reversible disorders lying at the coronary microvascular level.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The incidence of lung cancer is rising in women in the United States, and recent reports have suggested that female patients treated for small cell lung cancer have an improved survival compared with their male counterparts. In view of these findings, we decided to determine if, in our patient population, women live longer than men and if a higher proportion of female patients are entering our trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The survival of women entering therapeutic clinical trials for small cell lung cancer from 1973 through 1986 at the National Cancer Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch was evaluated and compared with the survival of similarly treated men during the same time period. RESULTS: The survival of female patients was longer than that of male patients (median of 13 months versus 10 months). Cox proportional hazards modeling incorporating multiple prognostic factors indicated that women survived significantly longer than men (p = 0.002) when adjustment for other significant factors was made. This survival advantage for women was consistent in both early and late time periods analyzed. In addition, women constituted a larger proportion of patients entering clinical trials in the later time period, as is consistent with the rising incidence of lung cancer in women nationwide. CONCLUSION: We believe it will be important that comparisons of current clinical trials with older trials that enrolled fewer women control for the favorable prognostic factor of the female sex.\r"

  ".U": "88292373\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: It has become evident in the past few years that amiodarone, a powerful antiarrhythmic agent, induces considerable side effects. These may be due to an amiodarone-elicited lipid storage disease and to the iodine content of amiodarone, but might also be causally related to amiodarone-induced immune reactions. The latter possibility prompted us to develop a sensitive anti-amiodarone antibody detection assay based on the immunodot technique. PATIENTS and METHODS: Sera were obtained from 10 untreated control subjects and 33 patients receiving amiodarone. Using serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:1,000, the lower detection limit was 0.3 microgram/ml of anti-amiodarone antibodies as calculated from a simultaneously performed IgG standard curve. RESULTS: Screening of sera from the untreated control subjects and amiodarone-treated patients revealed that the untreated subjects had no anti-amiodarone antibodies, that only one of 16 patients without clinical side effects had elevated anti-amiodarone antibodies, but that seven of 12 patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid disease and four of five patients with other side effects had elevated anti-amiodarone antibody titers (1.2 to 2.5 micrograms/ml). The combined evaluation of anti-amiodarone antibody titers and cumulative dose was found to be a highly reliable indicator of side effects, as all patients with more than 100-g cumulative dose of amiodarone and more than 0.6 microgram/ml of anti-amiodarone antibodies had side effects. CONCLUSION: The detection of anti-amiodarone antibodies in patients with amiodarone-elicited side effects underscores the possible contribution of immunologic reactions to the development of certain side effects.\r"

  ".U": "88292376\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Early menopause is widely regarded as a risk factor for osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether this risk is conferred by a lower bone mass. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirteen normal postmenopausal women and 55 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (vertebral fractures) underwent bone mass measurements at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and midshaft using dual-photon absorptiometry. To examine the effect of early menopause, postmenopausal normal women were stratified according to whether menopause occurred before or after the age of 50 years. Patients with osteoporosis were stratified in the same way. RESULTS: Patients with osteoporosis had menopause at an earlier age than control subjects, but the difference in bone mass between the patients with osteoporosis and the control subjects could not be attributed to this earlier age at menopause. Furthermore, within the osteoporotic patient group, those with early menopause did not have lower bone mass than those with normal age at menopause. Similarly, within the normal subject group, those with early menopause did not have lower bone mass than those with normal age at menopause. CONCLUSION: Patients with osteoporosis have lower bone mass, which is independent of the age at menopause. Although a small effect (less than or equal to 5 percent) of early menopause on bone mass cannot be entirely excluded, these data suggest that the amount of bone lost following menopause is the same irrespective of the age at which menopause occurs. If early menopause is a risk factor for osteoporosis, the risk is not conferred by a bone mass substantially lower than predicted had menopause occurred later, but may be related to the duration of exposure to minimal trauma at low bone mass.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on gestational age, 32 normal primigravid patients were divided into three groups: Group I (n = 10), less than 12 gestational weeks; Group II (n = 11), 13 to 26 gestational weeks; and Group III (n = 11), 27 gestational weeks or more. The pituitary dimensions and volumes in these groups were compared with those in 20 healthy nulliparous women (control group). RESULTS: MRI measurements showed a significant increase in pituitary volume in Groups I, II, and III when compared with the control group (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was an increase in pituitary volume between Groups I and II and between Groups II and III, although the former was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). At the end of pregnancy, the hypophysis had increased 2.6 mm in vertical, anteroposterior, and transversal dimensions, with an overall increase of 136 percent when compared with that of the control group. CONCLUSION: Baseline measurements of the normal enlargement of the pituitary gland that occurs during pregnancy could prove useful when evaluating pregnant patients with suspected pituitary tumors or lymphocytic hypophysitis.\r"

The acute vasodilatory effect of calcium channel blockers may be accompanied by changes in renal electrolyte handling that are important in renal electrolyte handling that are important in producing the hypotensive response seen with these agents. Nifedipine has been shown to cause acute and chronic natriuresis and diuresis, which are important in the ability to use nifedipine chronically in essential hypertension. We prospectively investigated the acute effect of 10 mg of nifedipine orally on renal cation handling in normotensive and untreated essential hypertensive subjects during a standard oral water load. At baseline there was no difference between normotensives and hypertensives in serum ionized calcium or magnesium, or in the urinary fractional excretion of these two cations. Oral nifedipine acutely increased the fractional excretion of sodium without changing the fractional excretion of calcium or magnesium. Nifedipine did not alter the serum concentrations of sodium, calcium, or magnesium. Augmented sodium excretion may play a role in the acute hypotensive response to oral nifedipine. The acute hypotensive response does not seem to be caused by altered renal handling of calcium or magnesium. Counterbalancing effects of nifedipine on proximal and distal nephron calcium handling may explain the disassociation of augmented sodium excretion and no net change in calcium excretion.\r"

The authors present a 35-year-old woman with signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis that was due to extensive replacement of the thyroid gland by adenocarcinoma (shown by fine needle aspiration). After chemotherapy with vincristine and cisplatin, the swelling of the thyroid resolved, thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine increased, and mild hypothyroidism developed. Despite the improvement in her thyroid status, she died from progressive malignancy. This case illustrates the value of fine needle aspiration cytology where doubt exists in the diagnosis of thyroid disorders.\r"

This case brings the number of reported mid-gut carcinoid tumors complicated by a second endocrine neoplasm to five. Three of the second tumors were parathyroid in origin, and the fourth was an insulinoma. In view of the rarity of second tumors and in the absence of documented familial occurrence, it is inappropriate to exhaustively study each person with mid-gut carcinoid tumor, or their families, for a second endocrine neoplasm; however, physicians caring for patients with mid-gut carcinoid should be aware that second tumors are possible. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is also a rare complication of carcinoid, but can be associated with renal failure that can be prevented by surgical intervention. Thus, physicians caring for patients with the carcinoid syndrome should also be aware of this complication.\r"

The overall mean annual rate was 12.2. A significant increase in the incidence rate in recent years was caused primarily by an increase in the number of sports-related injuries. Secondary hemorrhage occurred in 18 patients (7.3%) and was significantly (P less than .05) more frequent among patients whose initial hyphema filled more than one third of the anterior chamber. The low risk of secondary hemorrhage and associated serious sequelae suggests that the possible benefits from routine systemic administration of aminocaproic acid may not outweigh the costs and risks in populations similar to that of Olmsted County.\r"

One eye (4%) eventually atrophied; however, this was believed to be a result of the ongoing uveitis rather than the cryopexy. The treated eyes had an average improvement of three lines in Snellen visual acuity. We found that corticosteroid therapy remains the primary treatment modality for active inflammation, and vitreous base cryopexy should be reserved for those cases which are resistant to corticosteroids, and which demonstrate active neovascularization.\r"

In addition to measurement of intraocular pressure, pulmonary function tests were obtained before therapy (baseline), two or three weeks after initiating betaxolol therapy, and at yearly intervals. Before treatment with betaxolol, the mean ratio of forced expiratory volumes in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) was 66.3% (n = 101). After two weeks of betaxolol treatment, mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 66.2% (n = 101). After one year of betaxolol therapy, mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 60.1% (n = 24), and after two years it was 54.4% (n = 5). Nine patients developed symptoms that may have been associated with betaxolol treatment and were withdrawn from the study.

No relation was observed between abnormalities of tear composition and the clinical NO SPECS classification. There was a tendency for increased tear protein peaks in those patients with long-standing disease. Most patients with an increase in one or more tear protein levels had normal thyroid function after treatment for hyperthyroidism. Our findings suggested that the inflammatory process in the orbit occurring in Graves' ophthalmopathy also had an effect on the lacrimal gland, which was reflected in the composition of the tears.\r"

  ".W": "Six patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy experienced worsening of visual acuity and field loss during the six-week period after onset (range, three to six weeks), without apparent ophthalmoscopic changes. Thereafter, visual function remained unchanged. Various medications were used, but none prevented deterioration of visual function. Although not a widely recognized phenomenon, progression of visual deficit occurred in these patients in the early weeks after onset of ischemic optic neuropathy.\r"

The tearing began between 11 and 18 months after surgery. All patients had obstruction distal to the common internal punctum. The delayed onset suggested progressive cicatricial obstruction of the nasolacrimal drainage system. Damage to adjacent tissues probably caused scarring to extend into the system.\r"

  ".W": "Five patients developed corneal edema presumably caused by accidental preoperative ocular exposure to Hibiclens. In all cases, the patients complained of ocular pain after surgery. Conjunctival inflammation and corneal epithelial defects were found in all patients. Between two and ten weeks after exposure, stromal and epithelial edema, with a predilection for the inferior cornea initially, developed in all patients. The corneal edema resolved in three patients in approximately six months, leaving mild stromal scarring and reduced endothelial cell counts. The corneal edema in the other two patients progressed to diffuse bullous keratopathy, which eventually required penetrating keratoplasty. We recommend that Hibiclens be avoided in preoperative preparation of the facial skin to prevent accidental ocular exposure.\r"

Two patients complained of foreign-body sensation. One patient developed opacities of the anterior lens epithelium. Histopathologic studies of the eyes in one patient showed intraepithelial apical deposits in the cornea, conjunctiva, and lens epithelia. By electron microscopy, these deposits were found to be membranous lamellar inclusion bodies. These findings, as demonstrated by osmium-PAS staining and electron microscopy, were similar to those in other drug-induced lipid storage diseases.\r"
