  ".W": "Because of the central role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in immune recognition, it is often assumed that parasite-driven selection maintains the unprecendented genetic diversity of these genes. But associations between MHC genotype and specific infectious diseases have been difficult to identify with a few exceptions such as Marek's disease and malaria. Alternatively, MHC-related reproductive mechanisms such as selective abortion and mating preferences could be responsible for the diversity. To determine both the nature and strength of selection operating on MHC genes by we have studied components of selection in seminatural populations of mice (Mus musculus domesticus). Here we assess MHC-related patterns of reproduction and early (preweaning) mortality by analysing 1,139 progeny born in nine populations, and 662 progeny from laboratory matings. Reproductive mechanisms, primarily mating preferences, result in 27% fewer MHC-homozygous offspring than expected from random mating. MHC genotype had no detectable influence on neonatal (preweaning) mortality. These mating preferences are strong enough to account for most of the MHC genetic diversity found in natural populations of Mus.\r"

Here we report the appearance of the low-conductance Cl- channel in Chinese hamster ovary cells after stable transfection with the cystic fibrosis gene. The channel is regulated on-cell by membrane-permeant analogues of cAMP and off-cell by protein kinases A and C and by alkaline phosphatase. These results are further evidence that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is a Cl- channel which can be activated by specific phosphorylation events and inactivated by dephosphorylation; they reveal an unsuspected synergism between converging kinase regulatory pathways.\r"

Here we describe a new approach to interfering with viral replication in which a nuclease is fused to a capsid component so that the nuclease is encapsidated inside the virion where it can inactivate viral nucleic acid. We used Ty1, a yeast retrotransposon whose transposition closely parallels retroviral replication mechanisms and serves as an easily manipulated model for the retroviral infection process. We constructed fusion genes consisting of the region encoding the N-terminal portion of the TYA/TYB open reading frames of retrotransposon Ty1 and either of two different nuclease genes. Ty1-nuclease fusion proteins are targeted to Ty1 virus-like particles, and are active in degrading nucleic acids. A Ty1-barnase fusion protein causes 98-99% reduction in the efficiency of Ty1 transposition in vivo, presumably by degrading encapsidated Ty1 RNA. This strategy, referred to as capsid-targeted viral inactivation, may be useful for interfering with the replication of retroviruses and other viruses.\r"

  ".W": "Axonemal dyneins have two or three globular heads joined by flexible tails to a common base, with each head/tail unit consisting of a single heavy-chain polypeptide of relative molecular mass greater than 400,000. The sizes of the components have been deduced by electron microscopy. The isolated beta heavy chain of sea urchin sperm flagella, which is immunologically identical to that of the embryo cilia, is of particular interest as it retains the capability for microtubule translocation in vitro. Limited proteolysis of the beta heavy chain divides it into two fragments, A and B, which sediment separately at 12S and 6S, and possibly correspond to the head and tail domains of the molecule. Dynein ATPase is the energy-transducing enzyme that generates the sliding movement between tubules that underlies the beating of cilia and flagella of eukaryotes, and possibly also other large intracellular movements. Here we report that the deduced amino-acid sequence of the beta heavy chain of axonemal dynein from embryos of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla has 4,466 residues and contains the consensus motifs for five nucleotide-binding sites. The probable hydrolytic ATP-binding site can be identified by its location close to or at the V1 site of vanadate-mediated photo-cleavage. The general features of the map of photocleavage and proteolytic peptides reported earlier have been confirmed, except that the map's polarity is reversed. The predicted secondary structure of the beta heavy chain consists of an alpha/beta-type pattern along its whole length. The two longest regions of potential alpha helix, with unbroken heptad hydrophobic repeats 120 and 50 amino acids long, may be of functional importance. But dynein does not seem to contain an extended coiled-coil tail domain.\r"

There are motor-protein superfamilies in which each member has a conserved force-generating domain joined to a different 'tail' which conveys specific attachment properties. The minus-end-directed microtubule motors, the dyneins, may also constitute a superfamily of force-generating proteins with distinct attachment domains. Axonemal outer-arm dynein from sea urchin spermatozoa is a multimeric protein consisting of two heavy chains (alpha and beta) with ATPase activity, three intermediate chains and several light chains. Here I report the sequence of cloned complementary DNA encoding the beta heavy chain of a dynein motor molecule. The predicted amino-acid sequence reveals four ATP-binding consensus sequences in the central domain. The dynein beta heavy chain is thought to associate transiently with a microtubule during ATP hydrolysis, but the ATP-dependent microtubule-binding sequence common to the kinesin superfamily is not found in the dynein beta heavy chain. These unique features distinguish the dynein beta heavy chain from other motor protein superfamilies and may be characteristic of the dynein superfamily.\r"

Some phage-encoded methyltransferases methylate more than one sequence: these enzymes contain several independent target-recognizing domains each responsible for recognizing a different site. The amino-acid sequences of these multispecific methyltransferases reveal that some enzymes in addition carry domains that do not contribute to the enzymes' methylation potential, but strongly resemble previously identified target-recognizing domains. Here we show that introducing defined amino-acid alterations into these inactive domains endows these enzymes with additional methylation specificities. Gel retardation analysis demonstrates that these novel methylation specificities correlate with the acquisition of additional DNA-binding potential of the proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or \"crack\" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used.\r"

Serum CK was elevated in all (two to 11 times normal), and EMG suggested active myopathy in all but two. There were scattered granular degenerating fibers, with scant or no inflammation, in a pattern consistent with a toxic myopathy in all 18 patients biopsied. Three patients with an HIV-related inflammatory myopathy were distinguished by histologic differences. After stopping AZT (n = 15), myalgia promptly resolved (10 of 10). Strength improved more slowly with 12 of 15 regaining normal or nearly normal strength, but three have persistent weakness. CK returned to normal in 12 of 15, and follow-up EMG (n = 11) documented reduced fibrillation density in all 11 patients.

During a total of 160 treatment visits, an average of 242 +/- 75 units of Botox was injected per visit in cervical muscles of 42 patients with head tremor and 95 +/- 38 in forearm muscles of 10 patients with hand tremor; one patient was injected in both. The average peak effect for all patients was rated as 3.0 (0 to 4 scale). Thirty-five (67%) patients improved (peak effect greater than or equal to 1). The average latency from injection to response was 6.8 days, and the average duration of maximum improvement was 10.5 weeks. Local complications, lasting an average of 20.6 days, were noted in 17 (40%) patients injected for head tremor, consisting chiefly of dysphagia in 12 (29%), transient neck weakness in four (10%), and local pain in two (5%). Six (60%) patients with hand tremor had transient focal weakness. EMG recordings showed decreased amplitude of EMG bursts after Botox treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that Botox injections can be used to control tremor in patients in whom other forms of therapy have failed.\r"

From the 2,500 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of women was 42%, and from the 1,861 patients in the explanatory analysis it was 44%. The endpoint incidence was significantly higher in men than in women. The endpoint reduction was statistically significant only in the intention-to-treat analysis with total endpoints. However, there was a marked percentage reduction of endpoints in both men and women in explanatory analysis. The risk reduction of strokes was 49% for men and 41% for women, and the reduction of total endpoints was 39% in men and 30% in women. Thus, antiplatelet therapy is effective in the prevention of stroke or death in both sexes.\r"

After treatment, 13 patients improved clinically, and 78 of the lesions lost enhancement but remained visible on the unenhanced images. There were six new enhancing lesions on the second MRI. Thus, the blood-brain-barrier integrity improved after high-dose IV methylprednisolone, which correlated well with the clinical improvement. The lesions remaining visible on the unenhanced images indicate an incomplete histologic recovery at the time of the second scan, and also demonstrate that unenhanced MRI alone is not sufficient to monitor disease activity in the short term in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Our patients differ from those previously reported in that they had a predominance of tonic seizures and had no history of infantile spasms or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Some patients, such as ours, with MIED may have clinical seizures of more focal origin than might be expected from their interictal EEG and, therefore, may benefit from resective epilepsy surgery.\r"

This was not an entirely random event, however, as two-thirds of the patients developed their weakness during the 9th through the 12th week of continuous dexamethasone treatment. The risk of developing SM was significantly lower in patients taking phenytoin than in patients who were not taking anticonvulsants. The only other patient or treatment factor associated with SM was a possible direct correlation with the appearance of a cushingoid body habitus. In this retrospective review, the occurrence of SM had a significant negative impact on the quality of life of all affected individuals. As expected, patients who tolerated a reduction in their steroid dose improved, while other patients suffered the combined effects of tumor progression and worsening myopathy. Substituting a nonfluorinated glucocorticoid for dexamethasone is probably advisable if neuro-oncology patients affected by SM cannot be weaned from the steroids.\r"

There were 17 deaths among 65 demented patients and 28 deaths among 168 nondemented patients. When we matched a subset of the nondemented patients to the demented patients by age and disease duration distributions, the demented subjects had significantly more deaths (p less than 0.02), and survival among demented subjects was decreased (p less than 0.05). Dementia was a significant predictor of death in this sample. We conclude that dementia reduces survival in patients with PD. Incidence is a much better measure of dementia in PD than prevalence because shortened duration makes it less likely to detect dementia in prevalence surveys.\r"

Confrontation testing of visual fields in eccentric positions of gaze in hemianopic patients permits the discrimination of hemispheric from retinotopic deficits. In the primary position of gaze, a patient with an ischemic lesion of the right occipital and temporal lobes, who was without unilateral spatial neglect, was unable to detect finger movement, name objects, or identify shapes or colors in the left retinotopic hemifield, but when gazing 30 degrees to the right (so that the left retinotopic field was in the right hemispheric field), he performed nearly as well in the left retinotopic field as in the right. The mechanism of this gaze-dependent hemifield visual impairment is unknown, but we discuss four possibilities: (1) eccentric gaze enhances an alternative visual system; (2) the lesion led to modality-specific hemispheric inattention that was corrected by directing intention (plan to act) and gazing to the right; (3) the lesion led to modality specific inattention that was corrected by compensatory mechanisms that may normally enhance attentive vigilance in central space during eccentric gaze; and (4) the neuronal substrate for hemispheric vision was destroyed, whereas that for retinotopic vision was preserved.\r"

Spectra localized to chronic, irreversible plaques showed a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl/creatine resonance intensities relative to normal-appearing white matter. Spectra localized to active plaques showed different metabolite changes as compared with spectra from identical, plaque-free volumes in the contralateral hemispheres. Some active plaques showed either no abnormalities or only an increase in tissue lactate. Spectra from others showed an increased ratio of choline/creatine resonance intensities, with or without a decreased N-acetyl/creatine resonance intensity ratio. In one case, serial observations showed an evolution of changes in spectra from a single plaque from an increased choline/creatine ratio to a decreased N-acetyl/creatine ratio. These observations suggest that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be able to distinguish acute or active from chronic plaques and to characterize the pathologic evolution of active plaques by measurement of local tissue metabolite levels.\r"

Compared with normal controls, PSP patients had significantly reduced amplitudes and increased latencies for both the visual P2 and P300 components at all levels of probability. RTs and percent errors were significantly greater in the patients compared with controls. Neither the amplitude nor latency of the visual N1 component was significantly altered in these patients. There were no significant group differences in the distribution of electrical activity over the scalp for any of these ERP components, a finding which suggests that the neural structures responsible for generating these potentials were intact in these patients. The decreased ERP component amplitudes and increased ERP component latencies, combined with intact scalp distributions and increased RTs and error rates, present a pattern of results suggesting that the stimulus identification or categorization processes in these patients are significantly degraded.\r"

In addition to the standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), two different tests assessed the daytime vigilance: the Analogue Vigilance Scale (AVS) and the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). L-dopa improved vigilance and performance as evaluated by the AVS and the FCRTT, while the capacity to fall asleep rapidly remained unchanged as evaluated by the MSLT. Results of the present study suggest that L-dopa is effective in improving the vigilance level of narcoleptic patients and raises the hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in the physiopathology of excessive daytime sleepiness of this condition.\r"

One clone from a control cross-reacted with recombinant human AChR alpha chain (r37-429A) and with the synthetic peptide 125-143(S-S) from its sequence. Both these human antigens stimulated primary proliferative responses at substantially higher frequencies (26 to 59%) than native xeno-AChR--in both patients and controls--demonstrating that truly autoreactive T cells are not inevitably deleted during normal T-cell development.\r"

  ".W": "To assess changes in the relationship between cortical motor representation areas and their target muscles following spinal cord lesions, we studied motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation in six patients with complete spinal cord injuries at low thoracic levels and eight healthy subjects. Magnetic stimulation at rest activated a larger fraction of the motoneuron pool and evoked MEPs with shorter latencies from a larger number of scalp positions in muscles immediately rostral to the level of a spinal cord injury than in corresponding muscles in controls. The MEPs associated with maximal voluntary activation were not significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest enhanced excitability of motor pathways targeting muscles rostral to the level of a spinal transection, reflecting reorganization of motor pathways either within cortical motor representation areas or at the level of the spinal cord. The data do not allow the determination of the contribution of spinal or cortical mechanisms. However, they support the notion of a limited flexible relationship between primary motor cortex and its target muscles following alterations of normal input-output patterns.\r"

We asked subjects to report sensations felt after each stimulus. In all normal subjects, magnetic stimulation evoked sensations described as tingling or a wave descending along the leg, usually accompanied by EMG responses in leg muscles. In three of the seven patients, stimulation evoked sensations of tingling, numbness, touch, or a wave descending along the leg, lasting up to 10 seconds and referred to different parts of the legs and toes. In the patients, sensations were felt more distally the closer the site of stimulation was to the midline. Patients with leg paresthesias had less motor reorganization in abdominal muscles than those without paresthesias. These findings suggest that portions of the cortical representation areas for body parts deafferented by a complete spinal cord injury can remain related to those body parts for up to several years. A central origin of these paresthesias is probable.\r"

DNA analysis did not reveal a deletion of the dystrophin gene. Immunohistochemical studies of dystrophin in muscle biopsies showed a mosaic of fibers with and without dystrophin, and immunoblot analysis showed partial dystrophin deficiency in all three patients, more severe in the patient with the highest proportion of dystrophin-deficient fibers. These observations suggest that the patients are Duchenne muscular dystrophy carriers. The data also support the concept that uneven lyonization in muscle is responsible for the clinical myopathy in these patients. We suggest that any girl with sporadic proximal limb weakness should be evaluated as a possible Duchenne carrier by dystrophin studies.\r"

We found that levodopa levels increased significantly regardless of the type of diet, but that plasma LNAA levels varied less and motor performance was superior after the balanced diet than after the other two meals. We conclude that PD patients can consume nutritionally adequate meals and still maintain a stable plasma levodopa:LNAA ratio.\r"

The authors studied the long-term effects of OCP in 104 consecutive patients (average follow-up, 4 years) to determine whether complete remission could be achieved after a course of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Prolonged periods of remission while not undergoing therapy were maintained in approximately one third of patients with OCP. Follow-up must be continued for life, as relapse occurred in 22% of those who were in remission and not undergoing therapy. Those who relapsed regained disease control readily upon reinstitution of therapy and did not deteriorate to more advanced cicatrization. Sex, age, initial degree of inflammation, and the incidence of extraocular involvement did not have a prognostic significance on outcome. Mechanisms that underlie the differing responses to therapy are not yet known.\r"

When tested against a panel of common ocular pathogens, vancomycin combined with gentamicin proved more effective than gentamicin alone for inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 4 degrees C after 1- and 5-day incubation periods. Ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of paired human corneas stored for 5 days in either DexSol supplemented with vancomycin combined with gentamicin or DexSol with gentamicin alone did not show a significant difference in endothelial toxicity between the two groups. These results suggest that vancomycin combined with gentamicin has superior antimicrobial effect and similar corneal toxicity when compared with media supplemented with gentamicin alone.\r"

Thirty-one pseudophakic eyes received an intraocular lens exchange and nine aphakic eyes received a secondary intraocular lens. Postoperative follow-up averaged 24.5 months (range, 3 to 51 months). At 1, 2, and 3 years after keratoplasty, 39.3%, 63.2%, and 63.6% of eyes, respectively, had visual acuities of 20/40 or better. Ninety-five percent of the grafts remained clear. Causes of poor postoperative visual acuity included cystoid macular edema (32.5%), new glaucoma (22.5%), and age-related macular degeneration (10.0%). Other causes were endothelial rejection leading to graft failure, corneal ulceration, and retinal detachment. Corneal endothelial cell loss by specular microscopy was 11.5% at 1 years, 21.3% at 2 years, and 25.0% at 3 years. These results were compared with cell loss associated with iris-sutured posterior chamber lenses in penetrating keratoplasty. Visual outcomes and complication rates were similar between these two methods; however, the endothelial attrition at 1 and 2 years for the sutured posterior chamber lens was greater than that of the Kelman anterior chamber lens.\r"

To determine if bacteria are able to persist on scleral buckles by elaborating a glycocalyx matrix or biofilm that offers protection against host defenses and antimicrobial treatment, the authors cultured 28 scleral buckle elements removed for infection and extrusion. Bacteria were isolated from 18 elements (64%). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (8), Staphylococcus aureus (3), corynebacteria (3), Mycobacterium chelonei (3), and Proteus mirabilis (3). Eleven (65%) of 17 buckles evaluated with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria encased in biofilm. Biofilm was demonstrated on the surfaces and ends of solid silicon elements. In the silicon sponges, biofilm also extended into the matrix of the sponges. The authors believe that bacterial production of biofilm offers an explanation for the persistence of scleral buckle infections and their ability to withstand antimicrobial treatment.\r"

The extent of detachment, the presence of active disease in either the periphery or the posterior pole, and overall health served to determine what type of therapy was best suited for each patient. Although silicone oil appears to be best for patients with a total retinal detachment and active disease, this small series suggests that conservative modes of therapy such as laser photocoagulation and scleral buckles can be used successfully to treat these patients if there is an absence of active retinitis.\r"

The authors' experience with six cases suggests that choroidal detachment may be associated with both metastatic tumors and choroidal melanoma. In two of these cases, the choroidal or retinal detachment was so massive that echography was necessary to detect the underlying tumor. Three patients presented with painful visual loss, and three patients presented with painless visual loss or a visual field defect. In one patient, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the choroidal metastasis with external radiation relieved the patient's pain and improved visual acuity from 1/200 to 20/35. Metastatic and primary uveal malignant tumors should be added to the list of causes of choroidal detachment and can be excluded only after thorough clinical, and often echographic, examination.\r"

  ".W": "The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy. This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina. In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%). Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis. A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey. Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery. The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor. Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%). There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma. Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the impact of local intraocular tumor relapse on survival in a matched-group comparison study of patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed with cobalt 60 plaque radiotherapy. Sixty-two patients with local relapse were matched with an equal number of relapse-free patients in terms of known clinical prognostic factors for both melanoma-specific mortality (largest linear tumor dimension, location of anterior tumor margin, age) and local tumor relapse (location of posterior tumor margin). The follow-up of every relapse-free patient equaled or exceeded the interval to relapse for each matched patient with local relapse. The estimated 5-year survival (Kaplan-Meier) in the relapse-free patients was 87% (standard error = 4%), while that in the local relapse group was 58% (standard error = 6%). This difference is statistically significant (P less than 0.0001, log rank test). These results support the hypothesis that local tumor relapse after cobalt 60 plaque radiotherapy is an important post-treatment clinical indicator of the tumor's greater malignant potential and the patient's increased risk of melanoma-specific mortality.\r"

The pattern of acute infections of bones and joints has changed over the three decades studied. The frequency of secondary bone or joint infections due to S. aureus bacteremia has changed, as have the phage-type pattern and antibiotic resistance of the infective strains. The prevalence of hospital-acquired cases has increased and the age distribution of patients has changed, as is reflected in an increasing number of older patients. The localization of hematogenous osteomyelitis has shifted, and the vertebral column is now the most common site of infection. The rate of chronic cases of osteomyelitis that occur following acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has been reduced from 34% to 6%. The mortality associated with S. aureus bacteremic infections of bones or joints is low compared to that associated with other cases of S. aureus bacteremia.\r"

On the basis of historical, epidemiologic, clinical, and serologic data, four groups were identified: group I (108 cases) had negative agglutination reactions, and brucellosis was considered unlikely; group II (57 cases) had positive agglutination reactions, and active brucellosis was diagnosed; group III (37 cases) had positive agglutination reactions, but other factors--notably, a history of prior infection--made inactive brucellosis likely; and group IV (12 cases) had positive agglutination reactions, but insufficient data were available for further classification. Most patients with active brucellosis had agglutinin titers of greater than or equal to 160; however, no single titer was always diagnostic. Although more sensitive tests are available, agglutination reactions provide data sufficient to differentiate active from inactive disease when other factors are considered and follow-up sera are tested. This article discusses individual cases and reviews the literature on the diagnosis of brucellosis.\r"

Chest radiography gave normal results in one case and showed hilar lymphadenopathy in the other. Ultrasonographic findings were characteristic: homogeneous hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, with multiple filling defects of variable size. Diagnosis required splenectomy in one case and biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in the other. In both cases Ziehl-Neelsen staining gave positive results; M. tuberculosis grew from a culture of splenic tissue of one patient and from a culture of lymph nodal tissue of the other. There was a rapid response to antituberculous therapy. Splenic tuberculosis seems to be a distinct extrapulmonary entity in patients with AIDS. Ultrasonographic images are useful for diagnosis and follow-up.\r"

The papule, which at first had an annular shape, evolved into a pustule, ulcerated, drained, and assumed a crusted verrucous appearance. Multiple satellite papules appeared around the lesion, which was incompletely excised and thought to represent squamous cell carcinoma. Review of the histologic slides revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with multiple epidermal and dermal abscesses, pigmented hyphae, and yeast-like forms. Culture of material obtained at reexcision yielded a dematiaceous fungus that was identified as Exophiala pisciphila. No evidence of dissemination was found. This represents a unique report of human infection with this fungus, a well-recognized pathogen of fish. Except for the absence of sclerotic bodies, the clinicopathologic features resembled those of chromoblastomycosis rather than those of the subcutaneous cystic form of phaeohyphomycosis often associated with species of Exophiala.\r"

Of the eight cases of T. beigelii endocarditis that have been reported (one herein and seven previously), six involved prosthetic heart valves and two involved native heart valves. The clinical manifestations of this infection included embolization of the superficial femoral artery or of the bifurcation of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries in three of these patients (two with prosthetic valve and one with native valve endocarditis). In seven of the eight reported cases, blood cultures were positive for the organism. Although clinical isolates of the organism are generally reported to be susceptible to amphotericin B, isolates can vary in their sensitivities to antifungal agents in vitro depending on the methodology used, and clinical response to therapy with antifungal agents in a regimen that includes amphotericin B is generally poor. Only two of six patients who were treated with antifungal agents survived endocarditis caused by T. beigelii and were apparently cured; one of these patients was also managed surgically with valve replacement. Infection with T. beigelii should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endocarditis in immunocompetent patients, particularly those who have a prosthetic heart valve. Rapid, aggressive therapy may be necessary to eradicate this organism.\r"

Fifty-four patients (68%) developed 115 bacterial infections (1.46 episodes per patient), and seven patients died as a result of these infections. Fifty-three percent of bacterial infections occurred within 2 weeks after transplantation and were designated as early infections. The most common sites of infection were the abdomen (35 cases), the bloodstream (31 cases), and the surgical wound (19 cases). Aerobic enteric gram-negative bacilli were the predominant pathogens, and other pathogenic organisms were enterococci, staphylococci, and Pseudomonas bacteria. Logistic regression analysis identified prolonged duration of surgery (greater than or equal to 8 hours) and an elevated bilirubin level (greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL) as risk factors for early bacterial infection at any site; risk factors for abdominal or wound infection were prolonged duration of surgery, increased operative transfusion requirement (greater than or equal to 2 blood volumes), and prior hepatobiliary surgery. Awareness of the sites, pathogens, and time of onset of bacterial infection provides a basis for improved prophylaxis and empiric therapy.\r"

The rate of response was similar in the two groups (66% vs. 77%). The prevalence of secondary gram-negative bacteremia was higher--but not significantly higher--in the group receiving vancomycin. Adverse reactions also occurred more often in the latter group (35% vs. 4%). Mortality did not differ significantly in the two groups. Adjustment for independent predictors of response to treatment by means of multivariate analysis confirmed the lack of any remarkable difference between the responses to the two regimens. We conclude that the use of vancomycin instead of amikacin in combination with ceftazidime does not significantly improve the outcome of treatment of fever and infection in granulocytopenic children with cancer and that the use of vancomycin is associated with an increased frequency of both secondary infections due to gram-negative bacteria and adverse reactions.\r"

For patients with a positive blood culture, 14.3% of antibiotic-days were judged inappropriate in some regard, while for patients given aminoglycosides, 10.2% of antibiotic-days were thought to be inappropriate. The patterns of misuse were similar for the two groups despite disparate selection criteria. The unnecessary use of antibiotics was the single most common type of misuse in both groups, but errors in dosing collectively accounted for nearly one-half of antibiotic misuse. These results suggest that a variety of factors are responsible for misuse of antibiotics. Although the data presented do not allow conclusions about the optimal methods for control of antibiotic misuse, they imply that a multifaceted approach is probably required.\r"

This regimen was effective, with no evidence of relapse 7-8 months after therapy was discontinued. The relative infrequency of infection with L. monocytogenes in AIDS patients is unexpected. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) appears to be essential in the inhibition of Listeria in vivo. Elevated levels of TNF in AIDS patients may be protective against listeriosis and thus help explain the low prevalence of listerial infection in this population. Nonetheless, although L. monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of illness in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, it cannot be dismissed as a cause of undefined meningitis or sepsis.\r"

Although it has previously been speculated that gastrointestinal bleeding can result from infection with the varicella-zoster virus, the data from this case include histologic and cultural evidence that supports the clinical observations. The literature has been reviewed, and the management of this patient has been critically evaluated.\r"

Along with these concerns has come an increasing interest in the physical and chemical methods that may be used to inactivate HIV in blood products and other contaminated fluids as well as on contaminated objects and surfaces. This review critically examines the available information on the survival of HIV and the methods used for its inactivation, particularly those that rely on chemical disinfection. Although the risk of acquiring HIV from contaminated materials may be slight compared with that of acquiring other blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus, the effectiveness of disinfectants used under clinical conditions may have been overestimated.\r"

Even in industrialized countries rotavirus diarrhea in the young is among the leading causes of hospitalization. In temperate regions institutional outbreaks of the disease occur mainly in cold dry weather, whereas in tropical settings the seasonality is less well defined. Waterborne outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis have been recorded; air, hands, fomities, and food may also act as vehicles for this infection. Rotaviruses can survive for weeks in potable and recreational waters and for at least 4 hours on human hands. In air and on nonporous inanimate surfaces, the survival of rotaviruses is favored by a relative humidity of less than or equal to 50% and viral infectivity can be retained for several days. Rotaviruses are relatively resistant to commonly used hard-surface disinfectants and hygienic hand-wash agents.\r"

Temperature elevation has been associated with effects on the recognition, recruitment, and effector phases of the immune response. Specific immunologic responses are generally enhanced in the setting of temperature elevation within the physiologic range but not the supraphysiologic range. In contrast, natural immune responses may be unchanged or adversely affected. Temperature elevation appears to affect primarily the phase of recognition and sensitization or activation of mononuclear leukocytes. T lymphocyte responses (and/or the interactions of T lymphocytes with monocytes-macrophages) are enhanced for generation of effector cells. The activities of the effector cells, once generated, are usually not enhanced--or may even be depressed--by temperature elevation, but decreases are more than offset by increased T helper function. Overall, the data suggest that temperature elevations of the febrile response constitute a beneficial component of effective host defense.\r"

The hospital records at a tertiary-care medical center were retrospectively reviewed in an effort to determine the magnitude of these problems. A plethora of fungal species were isolated from patients. Hospital infection surveillance revealed between 30 and 40 nosocomial yeast infections per month, with 20% of nosocomial urinary tract infections caused by yeasts rather than by bacterial pathogens and one or two cases of fungemia per week. Although these figures represent a large number of nosocomial fungal infections, a significant increase in the number of such infections over the last several years could not be documented. The use of amphotericin B was found to have increased each year. The patterns of use of amphotericin B changed little between 1983 and 1987, but the number of patients treated with this agent increased dramatically.\r"

In this clinical setting mucocutaneous candidiasis as well as systemic cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis pose special diagnostic and/or therapeutic challenges. Compared with fungal infections in general, AIDS-associated mycoses are more likely to have nonspecific clinical manifestations; moreover, treatments effective in other settings seldom are curative. These problems have led to new vigilance regarding mycoses in the differential diagnosis of complications of infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and have necessitated a redefinition of goals: the aim is now to suppress rather than cure infection in most cases. This change has stimulated trials of new antifungal agents and regimens particularly designed to facilitate long-term outpatient management of mycoses without interfering with treatment of either HIV infection itself or other concomitant complications.\r"

With the increasing use of aggressive chemotherapy causing prolonged granulocytopenia in patients with cancer, the risk of disseminated fungal infection has increased. Although Candida and Aspergillus species are known to be the most common fungal pathogens responsible for disseminated infection, diagnosis of such infection may be difficult. The use of empiric amphotericin B for presumed disseminated candida infection may reduce morbidity caused by this fungal pathogen; moreover, amphotericin B remains the agent of choice for established candida infection, although fluconazole shows promise. The addition of flucytosine may enhance the efficacy of amphotericin B against Candida. Aspergillus infection is more difficult to treat. Early recognition of invasive aspergillosis and use of high-dose amphotericin B (1.0-1.5 mg/[kg.d]) alone or in combination with flucytosine may reduce associated mortality. More active, less toxic antifungal agents are needed to improve the efficacy of treatment and prophylaxis of disseminated fungal infection.\r"

Despite increased awareness among physicians and greater mycologic acumen, morbidity and mortality remain substantial. In part, this situation is due to the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of fungal infections by both the clinician and the laboratorian. Some of the factors contributing to these difficulties include the abrogation of the immune response associated with improved medical technology, the impact of AIDS, the invasion of the immunocompromised host by fungi previously considered to be saprobic, and the minimal mycologic training of medical personnel. Research efforts are under way that may be expected to improve the diagnosis and treatment of invasive mycotic diseases in the near future. For the present, it is recommended that mycologic training be encouraged and improved for all health care professionals.\r"

Granulocytopenic patients who are persistently or recurrently febrile despite therapy with appropriate antibacterial agents are at high risk for the development of such infection. Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the empiric administration of amphotericin B to persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic patients decreased the frequency, morbidity, and mortality of invasive fungal infection; these effects were especially marked in profoundly granulocytopenic patients who were not receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Current studies continue to indicate that prompt empiric administration of amphotericin B to persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic patients ensures earlier treatment of deep mycoses. The roles of newer antifungal triazole compounds and of liposomal and lipid complexes of amphotericin B in empiric antifungal therapy must be investigated further in thoughtfully designed, randomized clinical trials.\r"

Despite several courses of therapy with antibiotics to which her isolates of R. equi were susceptible in vitro, the patient experienced multiple relapses before her death. On the basis of this case and a few others reported in HIV-infected patients, we recommend an initial antibiotic course at least 6-8 weeks in duration, and we suggest that combination antibiotic treatment be considered. We also suggest that infection with R. equi be included in the diagnostic criteria for AIDS.\r"

One of 54 patients who had lumpectomy had a local recurrence and five had a recurrence regionally or at distant sites. In the group of 32 patients who had a mastectomy, one patient had a local recurrence and an additional four patients had a recurrence at other sites. The five year study disease-free survival rate was 83 per cent for the lumpectomy group and 78 per cent for the mastectomy group.

Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation. At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily. The patients had an uneventful recovery. The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine. Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury. After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections. Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration. A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication.\r"

The rate of infection was 2.8 per cent in high-risk groups, as compared with 0.6 per cent in patients undergoing elective operative procedures with no history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. Thus, antibiotics can probably be reserved for those patients who had emergency surgical treatment and for those with elective operations and a history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated for all patients who are 75 years of age or older, as bacteria in the bile seems to be common in this age group even without a history of the aforementioned complications.\r"

The dogs and pigs were sacrificed at two, three and six months. There was no mortality rate, no infections, no suture leakages and no crystal or stone formation. There were three instances of ureterovesical anastomotic stenosis. It appears that the absorbable staple can be safely used in urologic operations and that the use of the Poly CS 57 stapler for the construction of a bladder tube makes the procedure safer, simpler and faster.\r"

This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications. This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed. The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar. Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia. Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001). The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075). Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective.\r"

No statistical differences were found when these three groups were compared for age, body surface area, drug dosage, smoking history and a history of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction and pulmonary disease. These data indicate that all patients undergoing colonoscopy should be placed on supplemental oxygen. We further recommend continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring when available.\r"

Transduodenal common duct exploration after sphincteroplasty (TCDE/S) is an alternative method of duct exploration that avoids choledochotomy. Cholecystectomy followed by TCDE/S was performed upon 28 patients with nondilated ducts and suspected choledocholithiasis. Common duct stones were retrieved in 17 patients. Failure to retrieve stones in the remaining 11 patients was attributed to either false-positive results of cholangiography, forceful passage of stones into the duodenum during the initial insertion of a Fogarty catheter through the cystic duct or a false-negative finding at duct exploration. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients had asymptomatic postoperative hyperamylasemia. One patient had postoperative pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that resolved with antibiotic therapy by the eighth postoperative day. Other complications included wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia and otitis media. The over-all morbidity rate was 28.6 per cent. Long term follow-up was obtained in all 28 patients. All patients in the follow-up group are free of recurrent biliary tract disease. TCDE/S appears to be a safe and effective method of exploring the nondilated common bile duct.\r"

At the present time, the precise mechanism of microbial transport is unknown. Active epithelial uptake and phagocyte-mediated transport have been proposed as likely explanations for the extraintestinal movement of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes and distant organ sites. Translocation has been proposed as the pivotal process associated with intestinal origin portal sepsis in seriously ill and immunocompromised patients. While several etiologic factors can be implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial translocation, the present clinical implications are based almost solely on studies of dogs, rats and mice. Present investigations continue to suggest a causal relationship between intestinal mucosal integrity and infection by indigenous gastrointestinal bacteria.\r"

Accurate diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion combined with dynamic noninvasive testing and \"stress angiography.\" Although angiographic demonstration of medial deviation of the artery is diagnostic, absence of this finding does not exclude the diagnosis of entrapment of the popliteal artery. Positional angiography may be necessary in these instances. Surgical exploration should be performed by a posterior approach, since this facilitates identification of the precise anatomic variant while allowing easy arterial repair, if necessary. The condition of the popliteal popliteal artery must dictate the extent of the surgical procedure. If the popliteal artery is normal, then relief of the constricting lesion alone will suffice. If the artery appears diseased or is thrombosed, then myotomy and arterial reconstruction must be performed. This is best accomplished by bypass grafting using autogenous vein or artery. If thromboendarterectomy is used, the clinician can expect a higher percentage of acute postoperative thromboses.\r"

We studied the compatibility of Ringer's lactate solution and citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD)-preserved packed erythrocytes to evaluate the safety of using Ringer's lactate solution as a diluent in the emergency setting. Aliquots of CPD-preserved packed erythrocytes were diluted with either Ringer's lactate or normal saline solutions in ratios between 5:1 to 1:20 (packed erythrocyte to crystalloid), incubated at room temperature or 37 degrees centigrade and examined for clot formation at intervals up to two hours. Although clotting occurred at dilutions of 1:1 (packed erythrocytes to Ringer's lactate solution) and beyond, no clot formation occurred in the clinically relevant dilutions between 5:1 and 2:1. Thirty-two additional units of CPD-preserved packed erythrocytes were diluted to hematocrit values of 35, 45, 55 or 65 per cent and passed through a 170 micron filter. Flow rates of packed erythrocytes diluted with Ringer's lactate and normal saline solutions were compared. There was no difference in flow rates between packed erythrocytes diluted with Ringer's lactate compared with normal saline solutions. Ringer's lactate solution can be safely used as a packed erythrocyte diluent in patients requiring rapid blood transfusions.\r"

The diagnosis was made preoperatively with gastrointestinal contrast radiography and ultrasonography. At surgery, the intussusception was reduced, and 12 inches of nonviable bowel was resected, with a functional end-to-end anastomosis. An isoperistaltic intussusception occurred in the early postoperative period just distal to the anastomosis. Manometric evaluation of the Roux limb after the second operation showed altered gastrointestinal motility, consisting of orad-propagated and aboard-propagated migrating motor complexes, minimal phase 2 activity, and lack of conversion to the fed pattern with a liquid meal. Although manometry was not performed before the development of the intussusception, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered intestinal motility may contribute to the development of intussusception.\r"

  ".U": "91327291\r", 
  ".W": "From 1960 to 1988, 266 patients underwent resection of colorectal secondaries to the liver with curative intent. All patients were followed until April 1, 1990, or death, with a median follow-up time of 52 months. Nine patients with minimal macroscopic residual disease and 38 patients with all gross tumor removed but positive margins showed a poor prognosis with a median survival time of 13.3 months, the longest being 42 months. Of the 219 patients having potentially curative resection, 12 patients died postoperatively (5.5%). Actuarial 5, 10 and 20-year survival for the remaining 207 patients was 39%, 28%, and 18%, respectively. At April 1, 1990, 77 patients were alive with no evidence of disease for up to 24 years, and 12 patients had died without recurrence. The following factors were associated with less favorable crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0003), grade III/IV primary tumor (p = 0.035), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.017), satellite metastases (p = 0.0003), limited resection margins (p = 0.019), and nonanatomic procedures (p = 0.013). With respect to disease-free survival, grading of the primary (p = 0.055) and the extent of clear margins (p = 0.019) failed to achieve statistical significance. Two other criteria are commonly recommended as absolute contraindications to hepatic resection: extrahepatic disease and the presence of four or more independent metastases. A radical excision of all detectable disease may rarely be possible in these circumstances. Nevertheless, within the curative settings, no significant predictive value regarding either overall or disease-free survival was found in this series. Three corresponding \"high risk\" patients are alive without disease at 5 to 11 years from hepatic resection. These patients with more advanced intrahepatic or concomitant limited extrahepatic disease require a particularly thorough diagnostic work up. As no superior therapeutic alternative is currently available, an aggressive surgical approach may occasionally be justified, and may, in a small portion, result in definite tumor control.\r"

  ".W": "The conventional approach to prosthetic graft infection, including graft removal and extraanatomic reconstruction, conveys a substantial risk of limb loss and death and mandates more innovative solutions. From January 1985 to January 1989 eight rotational muscle flaps were performed on four men and three women with prosthetic graft infection who ranged in age from 42 to 79 years (mean, 67 years). The grafts involved included aortofemoral (three patients), femoropopliteal (two patients), femorofemoral (one patient), and subclavian-carotid-carotid (one patient) and were composed of Dacron (five grafts) or polytetrafluorethylene (two grafts). Infections were in the groin in six patients and in the neck in the other patient; all patients had anastomotic exposure. Clinical presentations included abscess/purulent drainage (four patients), anastomotic hemorrhage (two patients), and anastomotic false aneurysm (one patient) and was associated with fever and/or leukocytosis in all patients. Positive bacterial cultures were obtained from all patients. Rotational muscle flaps performed included rectus abdominis (five grafts), pectoralis major (one graft), gracilis (one graft), tensor fascia lata (one graft); in two patients, rotational muscle flaps were performed after failed local sartorius muscle transfer. No major complications of the RMF procedures were encountered. One patient died 4 months after the operation of complications of ischemic colitis/perforation. The other six patients were discharged with completely healed wounds. One patient developed recurrent infection 12 months after the rotational muscle flap procedure; five (83%) patients have been followed for 12 to 51 months (mean, 27 months) without evidence of recurrent infection. These preliminary results suggest that rotational muscle flaps are a safe and effective treatment for prosthetic graft infection, even when local sartorius muscle coverage has failed.\r"

  ".W": "Partial or complete obstruction of the superior vena cava and its major tributaries occassionally results in incapacitating venous hypertension of the upper extremities and/or head and neck. Factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the central veins play a role in the pathogenesis. The more common causes include mechanically and chemically induced intimal injury with resultant fibrosis, sclerosis, or thrombosis and neoplastic masses with external compression or direct extension in the central venous structures. Medical therapy is indicated in the acute situation and generally allows the time necessary for development of collateral drainage routes. Persistent or progressive symptomatic venous hypertension develops in 5% to 40% of these patients, and approximately 10% of the patients will remain incapacitated. Presented here is a series of 10 patients who underwent reconstruction of the superior vena cava or central veins for incapacitating venous hypertension of the upper extremities and/or head and neck. Reconstruction was accomplished by venous transposition (three patients), externally reinforced ePTFE (six patients), and reversed saphenous vein graft (one patient). No perioperative deaths occurred; however, two late deaths occurred at 3 and 9 months after reconstruction from causes unrelated to the operative procedure. One patient experienced early postoperative graft thrombosis requiring thrombectomy, after which the graft remained patent. All patients had patent grafts and were asymptomatic with respect to their venous disease at the time of preparation of this manuscript, with a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Specific details concerning these 10 cases are discussed and integrated with a focused review of the literature and the historic development of the intraoperative techniques and postoperative care that facilitate the successful management of patients with symptomatic central venous occlusion.\r"

All cases of acute venous thrombosis have been categorized and entered into a computer data base. One thousand four hundred twelve examinations were positive for acute venous thrombosis. This report analyzes the laboratory's entire experience with superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT). One hundred eighty-six patients were diagnosed by duplex scanning to have SVT. Women outnumbered men 99 to 87. They were slightly older (average age 58.4 +/- 16.2 years) compared with the men (53.8 +/- 14.2 years). Men were more likely to have a complicated course of SVT (40% vs 22%; p less than 0.01). Complications included either radiographically documented pulmonary embolism or deep venous involvement. Fifty-seven (31%) patients had at least one complication of SVT. A series of predisposing factors was analyzed and six factors were associated with an increased risk of complications. They are bilateral SVT (p less than 0.01), age greater than 60 years (p less than 0.01), male sex (p less than 0.01), history of deep venous thrombosis (p less than 0.01), bed rest (p less than 0.02), and presence of infection (p less than 0.02). Location of thrombus within the greater saphenous vein (35%) was most likely to be associated with complications. Isolated varicosities (8%) were least likely to be associated with complications. Duplex scanning identifies a significant number of complications of patients with SVT and should be obtained in cases of saphenous vein involvement or in the presence of associated risk factors.\r"

  ".U": "91327296\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we have assessed the hypothesis that there is a postreceptor defect in glucose metabolism that makes the severely burned patient unable to oxidize glucose efficiently as an energy source. The intracellular pyruvate pool was labeled by the infusion of 3-13C-lactate, and expired CO2 production and isotopic enrichment of both pyruvate and CO2 were determined to calculate the rate of pyruvate production and oxidation. 6,6-d2-Glucose and 15N-alanine were infused simultaneously to relate pyruvate kinetics and oxidation to glucose and alanine kinetics. Five normal volunteers and 10 severely burned patients (mean of 80% +/- 5% body surface burned) were studied in the basal state and during continuous (unlabeled) glucose infusion. Also, the effect of dichloroacetate, which normally stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, was assessed in both volunteers and patients. The burned patients had many of the classic metabolic responses to severe injury, including significant increases in resting energy expenditure, glucose production, and alanine release from protein breakdown. However, rather than being inhibited, the rate of pyruvate oxidation was increased approximately 300% in burned patients. Although the patients had an elevated mean concentration of lactate, stemming from increased lactate production, no deficit in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was evident. Rather, the high rate of lactate production was apparently a consequence of the high rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, the direct pathway for synthesis of glycogen from infused glucose appeared to be impaired in burned patients. In both volunteers and patients, dichloroacetate stimulated the percent of pyruvate directed to oxidation, thereby reducing the conversion of pyruvate to other fates, including lactate. However, because there was no deficit in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in the patients compared with normal volunteers before dichloroacetate treatment, no unique effect of dichloroacetate on glucose or protein kinetics was observed in burned patients. From these results we conclude that if there is a postreceptor defect in glucose metabolism in burned patients, it involves the pathway of direct glycogen synthesis and not the pathway of oxidation.\r"

The proportion of patients with symptomatic tumors was similar to those patients with carcinoid tumors that were incidentally found (55% versus 45%; SE = 0.089). Symptoms were caused by metastatic tumor in nine (30%) of the patients and by local effects of the primary tumor in eight (26%) of the patients. The patients with symptoms had a significantly increased frequency of metastatic disease, even when the symptoms were due to the primary tumor, compared to patients with no symptoms (76% versus 7%; p less than 0.001). Tumor size was related to the presence of symptoms and metastases. Symptoms were most common when the size of the primary tumor was greater than 1.0 cm (p less than 0.005), although the rate of metastases increased when primary tumors were 2.0 cm and larger (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that the presence of symptoms or a primary tumor 2.0 cm or larger are associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. These patients should be treated with wide resection of the primary tumor and its lymphatic drainage.\r"

Eighteen grafts (length 138 +/- 3.4 mm) were tested in paired sequential fashion (four grafts, 4 and 8 mm; five grafts, 6 and 10 mm) in nine greyhounds (femoral vein diameter, 7.7 +/- 0.09 mm). Bilateral hindlimb venous pressures and flows were measured before and after unilateral iliofemoral venous ligation, 30 minutes after CFB insertion, and for 5 minutes after venous flow augmentation induced by stimulated muscle contraction. CFBs of all sizes were equally effective at relieving the occlusive venous hypertension at rest. Muscle contraction elevated venous pressure in all ligated hindlimbs (p less than 0.0001); however, the pressure returned to baseline by 3 minutes in dogs with 6, 8, and 10 mm grafts but remained elevated (p less than 0.05) with the 4 mm grafts even after 5 minutes. Peak graft flow (first 90 seconds after contraction) was significantly greater through the 8 mm grafts than through the 4 mm grafts (p less than 0.01), although no difference was noted in flow rates between 6 and 10 mm grafts. The pressure gradient across the graft as predicted by the mathematic model for 6 to 10 mm conduits was less than 5 mm Hg for flows up to 1000 ml/min, although the pressure gradient of the 4 mm graft exceeded 5 mm Hg at 200 ml/min and approached 30 mm Hg at 1000 ml/min. Therefore, data from both canine and mathematical models agreed that, at rates approximating human resting flow (1000 ml/min), no adverse short-term hemodynamic consequences result from CFB conduits of 6 to 10 mm diameter.\r"

We report the treatment of 30 patients with intrahepatic calculi and high duct strictures by means of selective central hepatic resection without dissection of the major vessels at the hilum. Central hepatic resection provided satisfactory access to the primary and secondary confluences of the intrahepatic ducts, allowed removal of residual stones and ascariasis, and permitted correction of multiple strictures. Twenty-nine patients so treated were followed for a mean of 32 months after operation. No patients developed recurrent fever, biliary colic, or jaundice after the operation. The technique is therefore recommended as an effective alternative to extensive hepatic lobectomy in the treatment of the intrahepatic calculi with multiple strictures.\r"

Survival beyond 7 days after orthotopic transplantation of the stored liver was eight of eight rats in control groups (immediate transplantation, less than 1-hour preservation), one of 14 rats with the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, four of 14 rats with SLS, seven of eight rats with SLS + chlorpromazine, 1 mg/L, and seven of eight rats with SLS + chlorpromazine, 10 mg/L. The differences is survival between UW and SLS and between SLS and SLS + chlorpromazine were significant (p less than 0.05). Lactic dehydrogenase levels in the effluent after reflushing through the portal vein at the time of transplantation were 145 +/- 20 IU/L (mean +/- SEM) in the controls, 525 +/- 78 IU/L in UW, 492 +/- 44 IU/L in SLS, 290 +/- 39 IU/L in SLS + chlorpromazine, 1 mg/L, 290 +/- 11 IU/L in SLS + chlorpromazine, 10 mg/L. The values for the SLS + chlorpromazine were significantly lower than for SLS and UW (p less than 0.05). The pH of the effluent was 7.10 +/- 0.10 in controls, 6.42 +/- 0.12 in UW, 6.64 +/- 0.18 in SLS, and 7.07 +/- 0.02 in SLS + chlorpromazine, 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L. The pH drop was significantly greater in the groups without chlorpromazine (p less than 0.01). This study shows that superior rat liver preservation was achieved with a simplified lactobionate solution containing sodium as the principal cation, sucrose in place of raffinose, and omitting the colloid and several of the other UW components. The addition of low concentrations of chlorpromazine further enhanced the effectiveness of this solution, without the need for donor pretreatment.\r"

Atypical mycobacterial skin infections may be seen as chronic ulcerations with violaceous edges, rolled margins, and significant subcutaneous necrosis. An indolent course and the clinical appearance may aid in diagnosis. In our experience, limited incision and drainage or dressing changes fail to eradicate these infections, even when accompanied by appropriate antibiotic therapy. Successful treatment requires aggressive debridement of all infected subcutaneous tissues and skin. Split-thickness skin grafting was successfully used to cover large wounds. Grafting did not appear to foster recurrent infection.\r"

Thirty-two age- and roughly sex-matched healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and served as controls (group C). There was a trend for patients with classic migraine to have more subcortical patchy lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. In a comparison of our control subjects and patients with a history of greater than 20 attacks of classic migraine taken from groups A and B, this difference in number of lesions was significant (p = 0.02). The results suggest that patchy lesions in patients with classic migraine should be interpreted with particular caution before diagnosing a demyelinating disease since the lesions could be ischemic in origin.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the temporal threshold for focal cerebral infarction in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The right middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery were occluded for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 24 hours, and all the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Cortical infarct volumes and edema volumes were quantified in serial frozen sections of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue using image analysis. Upon occlusion, blood flow in the core of the ischemic zone, measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, fell to a mean +/- standard deviation of 21 +/- 7% of the preocclusion baseline value (n = 26). During the first hour of ischemia, blood flow in the densely ischemic zone rose to 27 +/- 8% of baseline (n = 25). Release of the middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery occlusions rapidly restored cortical blood flow to 213 +/- 83% of baseline (n = 21). Focal ischemia of 1 hour's duration caused little or no infarction, while ischemic intervals of 2 and 3 hours produced successively larger volumes of infarcted cortex. Ischemic intervals of 3-4 hours' duration followed by approximately 20 hours of recirculation yielded infarct volumes that were not significantly different from those after 24 hours of permanent focal ischemia. The results indicate that 3-4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia in this rat model is sufficient to attain maximal infarction and suggest that recirculation or pharmacological interventions after this time will provide little benefit.\r"

Histological injury was absent in the sham-operated group. In the ischemic group, hippocampal injury was restricted to field CA1, while damage in the neocortex and caudoputamen was sparse. Motor tests performed on postoperative days 18 and 28 revealed no significant differences between the ischemic and sham-operated groups. Retention performance of a radial maze discrimination task was impaired, with a significant but transient increase in both working and reference memory errors. Passive avoidance acquisition and retention were not significantly affected, although conclusions concerning the utility of this task must be reserved because of variability in the behavior of the sham-operated rats. Morris maze spatial navigation (place learning) and open-field activity were insensitive to treatment group. These functional results are consistent with the observed histological injury and what is known about hippocampal injury and behavior, and they provide further guidance for the development of neurological assays appropriate for discriminating outcome from forebrain ischemia in rats.\r"

  ".U": "91327359\r", 
  ".W": "Several feasible mechanisms have been proposed as sources of neuronal damage from ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Included among these are oxidative damage caused by free radical production and lipid peroxidation and products derived from phospholipid breakdown. A series of 4-thiazolidinone compounds represented by LY178002 (5-[3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]methylene-4-thiazolidinon e) have been described as inhibitors of multiple enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade, including fatty acid cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and phospholipase A2. Accordingly, we evaluated LY178002 in a four-vessel occlusion model of global forebrain ischemia with reperfusion. A 2-hour pretreatment of 11 male Wistar rats with 150 mg/kg LY178002 significantly protected against striatal (p = 0.0007) and hippocampal CA1 (p = 0.006) damage after 30 minutes of global ischemia. Similar protection was observed for the striatum (p = 0.005) and hippocampal CA1 layer (p = 0.025) after pretreatment of 13 rats with 50 mg/kg LY178002. We further evaluated LY178002 as a possible inhibitor of lipid peroxidation because part of its chemical structure incorporates the aromatic backbone of the known antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene. We found LY178002 to be a potent inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Few substances possessing a single pharmacological activity have been found to be of significant therapeutic benefit in global ischemia of 30 minutes' duration because the mechanisms that lead to cell death in response to ischemia are likely to be multifactorial. Thus, the efficacy of LY178002 in this model may be due to its ability to inhibit multiple sources of damage.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of embolic events ipsilateral to an occluded carotid artery is uncertain. To examine this question we combined occlusion of the left common carotid artery with embolism from the right common carotid artery in rats. Following ligation of the left carotid artery in 20 experimental rats, we irradiated the right carotid artery with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 12-15 minutes) following the intravenous injection of 12.5 mg/kg of the photosensitizing agent Photofrin II. Controls had left carotid artery occlusion with (n = 13) or without (n = 6) Photofrin II. Fifteen of the 20 experimental rats survived to be perfused at 24 hours; cerebral infarcts were identified in 12 rats, with bilateral infarcts in 10. There were 112 infarcts (101 small [less than 2.5 mm] and 11 large [greater than 2.5 mm] on the right and 103 (93 small and 10 large) on the left. Emboli were seen in association with some infarcts and were evenly distributed in the two hemispheres (37 emboli on the right and 40 on the left, with the midline azygous artery occluded in four animals). Left carotid artery occlusion did not produce infarcts or emboli in the controls. We conclude that cerebral infarcts in the distribution of an occluded common carotid artery may be caused by emboli from the contralateral carotid artery in rats.\r"

We review the literature on the cortical and intracerebral territories of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. Although most authors claim that these territories are relatively consistent, the results of their studies show many and considerable discrepancies. The variability described by Beevor has been neither excluded nor completely confirmed, yet somehow the concept of a relatively unchanging pattern of the peripheral cerebral vascularization has gradually settled into the literature. We discuss the considerable variability of the cerebral territories, as well as the discrepancies in investigation techniques, injection materials, and specimen conditions that could be factors producing these dissimilar results. Our study shows that there are no arguments in the literature to negate the variability of the cerebral territories.\r"

Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension.

In patients with high-stage disease, 73 percent of the older group but none of the younger had DNA diploid tumors. Low-stage clear cell carcinoma caused cancer death only in the young. Stage I nondiploid clear cell carcinomas were associated with death (33%) only in the young. Overall, death rates seem similar for both groups but among the young most (63%) occurred with low-stage disease and a nondiploid pattern only; among the old, 88 percent occurred with high-stage disease and independent of DNA ploidy pattern.\r"

Specific infectious diseases, structural or functional causes were identified in 34 (45%) of the 75 patients. Genitourinary tract pathogens were isolated from 26 patients and inflammation was documented in urethral or prostatic secretions of 24 patients. Structural or functional abnormalities that merited treatment were identified in 8 cases. In addition, major criteria for depression were documented in 9 of 17 patients who agreed to this evaluation. Overall, a comprehensive approach to diagnosis led to specific treatment for 37 (49%) of the 75 men with chronic prostatitis, despite longstanding symptoms and failure of multiple prior courses of therapy.\r"

Pre- and postoperative interviews with detailed questionnaires were utilized. Postoperative sexual dysfunction was reported by 18 of 152 patients (11.8%) who were functioning normally prior to surgery. The incidence of postoperative impotence was evenly distributed between the TURP and SPP groups and was age-related; it was highest among older patients. We further observed a strong correlation between the presence of a permanent sexual partner and the preservation of potency. We conclude that the risk of postoperative impotence is dependent on both the patient's age and the presence of a partner, and should be discussed with the patient preoperatively.\r"

Of these, 66.6 percent (124/186) were diagnosed to have nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGT) and 22 percent (41/186) were clinically determined to have Stage I disease. Patients with clinical Stage I NSGT either underwent observation or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Recurrence in the observation group of patients was 23.5 percent (4/17) between four and eighteen months (mean 10 months) with the retroperitoneum being the most common site. All but 1 patient (80%) were salvaged with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who had RPLND, 21 percent (5/24) had a false-negative metastatic evaluation. All the patients who had surgically documented metastatic disease were successfully treated with chemotherapy. The similar recurrence rates in the observation group and the false-negative RPLND group suggest that the failure rate in the observation group is a result of the inability to stage accurately patients with NSGT. RPLND continues to be the standard therapy in patients with clinical Stage I disease. Despite its high recurrence rate, observation should, however, be offered to well-motivated and selected patients since salvage platinum-based combination chemotherapy is very effective and the majority of patients in this group are spared a major operative procedure.\r"

Comparisons between users and non-users of diuretics and continence and incontinence status revealed no significant difference in the prevalence of incontinence in either gender. However, when male respondents who had cystometric examinations were analyzed, it was found that diuretic users who have uninhibited detrusor contractions (UDC) had a significantly higher prevalence of urinary incontinence (85.7%) when compared with non-users with UDC (25%) (p = 0.009). Among men who did not have UDC, use or non-use of diuretics showed a similar relationship but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.085). There were too few female respondents with UDC to make meaningful analysis in this group.\r"

Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels increased in 8 of 83 patients tested (10%). C-terminal parathyroid hormone levels were measured in 79 patients and were elevated in 15 (19%); their serum creatinine level was normal. Thirteen of this group had normal serum calcium levels, whereas 7 patients with hypercalcemia and no clinically evident bone metastasis had normal parathyroid hormone levels. In only 2 of 72 patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme 1 were elevated. Only 1 of 85 patients had mildly elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen, in contrast to 3 of 7 patients with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis who had moderately elevated carcinoembryonic antigen. Elevations in alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and parathyroid hormone correlated with the course of the disease in 13 patients for whom follow-up measurements were available; measurement of these markers, however, is only useful in a small proportion of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\r"

At initiation of therapy patients' ages ranged from forty-eight to eighty-two years (median, 68 years). The usual follow-up interval was 6 +/- 3 months, and follow-up periods ranged from six months to one hundred twenty months (median 48 months). The cytologic findings were categorized under four cytologic response types and palpation findings under five response grades. Four different degrees of squamous metaplasia (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) were observed in smears, depending on semiquantitative determination of squamous metaplastic cells in relation to the total amount of benign and malignant epithelial cells in the smear. There were 341 follow-up observations in which both transrectal fine-needle aspiration cytology and palpation were done. In 306 of these, cytologic findings were found to be adequate. Comparison of squamous metaplasia with cytologic response types revealed a highly significant difference between the benign state and recurrence/frank malignancy. This was also true when frequency of squamous metaplasia was compared with palpatory response grades. It was found that squamous metaplasia can be a valuable adjunct to other cytomorphologic changes such as shrinkage of tumor cell size and decrease in size of nucleoli or its disappearance, in determining response to hormonal therapy.\r"

Each patient was randomized to receive either gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or 500 mg ciprofloxacin (Cipro-Miles) p.o., before and after the biopsy. Serum and prostate tissue levels of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and by competitive binding immunoassay, respectively. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patients were observed for twenty-four hours after biopsy. After discharge the patients were followed up by telephone. The incidence of bacteremia and postbiopsy symptoms were less with ciprofloxacin. Prostate tissue levels of this drug were higher than gentamicin, while serum levels were roughly equivalent. Ciprofloxacin is less nephrotoxic, can be given orally, and has a better antimicrobial spectrum. We, therefore, recommend it as prophylaxis against bacteremia in transrectal prostate needle biopsy. Furthermore, it appears that prostatic drug levels are more important than serum levels in preventing bacteremia.\r"

The combined effect of radiation and heat produced greater cytotoxicity than predicted from the additive effects of the two individual treatment modalities alone. These results indicate that a combined treatment regimen of radiation plus hyperthermia (43 degrees, 1 hr) might be an important tool in maintaining a better local control of prostatic cancer.\r"

Local programs must show that they have similar success. Because the definitions of terms such as \"back school,\" \"work hardening,\" and \"functional restoration\" are blurred at a local level, the choice of a program for an individual patient must depend primarily on the program's demonstrated success rate with similar patients. The chances of returning to work decrease as a function of time after injury. Therefore, referring physicians, insurers, and employers must be provided with information regarding results in terms of acute (0 to 6 weeks), subacute (7 to 12 weeks), and chronic (more than 12 weeks) back pain. Other important variables include selection criteria, program cost, and dropout rate. We advocate standardized reporting of such data for all worker rehabilitation programs. A model \"report to consumers,\" described here, is a minimal obligation. The validity of a number of important internal quality assurance issues is uncertain. Ethical and legal pressures must be recognized.\r"

The reported incidence is between 25% and 80%. The origins are multifactorial and can be associated with underexertion, overexertion, inactivity due to intercurrent illness or injury, hypo-oxygenation, sleep apnea, deconditioning, and the failure of sprouted, compensatory large motor units. The exercise question in postpolio syndrome is related to the experience of new weakness or loss of muscle function due to overuse, which is often associated with injudicious repeated challenges to weakened musculature. Carefully prescribed exercise can be used for increasing strength and endurance and improving cardiopulmonary conditioning.\r"

  ".W": "The aging cardiovascular system undergoes many anatomic and physiologic changes. Increased vascular resistance, myocardial \"stiffness,\" abnormalities of rhythmicity of the sinoatrial node, irregular cardiac rhythms, and alterations in heart rate and blood pressure responses are all seen more frequently in older patients. These changes are likely to impair these patients' ability to make the rapid adjustments necessary to maintain cardiac output during exercise and activity. When cardiovascular disease processes are superimposed on the \"normal\" concomitants of aging, greater alterations in hemodynamic response to exercise activity are noted than usually occur in younger cardiac patients. Exercise testing of older cardiac patients is safe and is usually needed to prescribe an appropriate intensity of exercise activity. The choice of the exercise protocol, the timing of the exercise test in relation to taking prescribed cardiac medication, the choice of exercise equipment, and special considerations for devices such as pacemakers and automatic implantable cardiodefibrillators must be considered before the exercise test is done. Many of these factors and the presence of either silent or overt cardiac symptoms or untoward hemodynamic events will also affect the exercise prescription. Elderly patients usually show substantial functional improvement when participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program and comply well with prescribed exercise. Early educational intervention may be crucial to reducing disability in these patients.\r"

A substantial portion of this decrease is the result not of aging but of the sedentary life-style so frequently associated with aging. In \"healthy old\" persons and in older animals in experiments, an appropriate exercise program can result in increased strength and endurance. This is true both in longitudinal and short-term studies. As physical impairment increases, the exercise program must be individualized, and results are not as readily predictable. Much work remains before we may be certain how much exercise can be tolerated in these more impaired persons and what the effects may be.\r"

It provides patients with chronic lung disease the ability to adapt and live full and nearly normal lives. These changes are possible because the overall disability includes significant reversible components: Patients have bronchospasm, infection, and cor pulmonale; they respond to progressively impaired lungs by progressive inactivity, leading to physical deconditioning. Both factors contribute to dyspnea. Because patients naturally fear dyspnea, they panic easily. During panic, their work of breathing may increase and respiratory failure may result. Pulmonary rehabilitation provides good medical management; provides exercises to increase strength, endurance, and tolerance to dyspnea; and trains patients in panic control. These programs have not been shown to lengthen life span or improve static lung function. They increase exercise performance and render patients functional, independent, and subject to fewer hospital admissions. Pulmonary rehabilitation is the only approach to chronic lung disease short of lung transplantation that improves the long-term outlook for these patients.\r"

Exercise testing using lower extremity exercise has been the \"gold standard\" for screening for coronary artery disease, but many patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with amputations have difficulty doing this type of exercise. Arm exercise ergometry has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative for the detection of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot do leg exercise. This test has also been used to determine safe exercise levels and may be able to predict the ultimate level of prosthetic use in amputees. Exercise training with arm ergometry also improves cardiovascular efficiency and upper body strength in poorly conditioned patients. Studies are needed to appreciate fully the role of exercise testing and training in the recovery of these patients after amputation.\r"

Decreased lengths of initial and subsequent hospital stays and increased survival rates are also documented. Most persons are discharged to a private residence in the community and remain there.

Spinal cord injury has only a short-term effect on marriage and divorce rates, which appears to dissipate within a few years after injury.

The women delayed pregnancy an average of 6.5 years after their injury, with an average age at first pregnancy of 26.8 years. Cesarean section was necessary in 4 patients because of inadequate progress of labor. In 5 deliveries an episiotomy and local anesthesia were required, 7 required epidural anesthesia, including all cesarean sections, and 10 did not require anesthesia. Several complications have been identified in the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods including autonomic hyperreflexia, premature labor, pressure sores, urinary tract infections, abnormal presentation, and failure to progress.

  ".W": "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are present in patients with systemic vasculitis with or without renal involvement. These antibodies were first seen using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Two types of patterns are seen on ethanol-fixed neutrophils: the cytoplasmic and the perinuclear pattern. The cytoplasmic pattern is called C-ANCA (classical or cytoplasmic ANCA) and the perinuclear, P-ANCA. Antibodies to a serine proteinase, called proteinase 3 or myeloblastin, give rise to the C-ANCA pattern, while antibodies to myeloperoxidase give rise to the P-ANCA pattern. Proteinase 3, as well as myeloperoxidase, is present in the primary granules of neutrophils, and the P-ANCA pattern is thus an artifactual staining pattern. Myeloperoxidase, which is a basic protein, redistributes during ethanol fixation from the primary granules to the negatively charged nucleus. As an alternative to the IF technique, several solid-phase assays have been developed using either 125I or enzyme-labeled secondary antibodies. Depending on the degree of purification of the antigens used, such assays may be used for screening or as a complement to the IF method. Today it is possible to directly screen for both types of ANCA using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Simultaneous screening for antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies (Goodpasture antibodies) increases the diagnostic yield, especially in patients with renopulmonary syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "The results presented during the Third International ANCA Workshop, Washington, DC, 1990, allowed a better definition of the antigenic specificity of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The large predominance of two major antigen specificities for proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), in the group of vasculitic patients, was confirmed. PR3 and MPO are colocalized in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and translocated to the cell surface during activation and thus are able to interact with ANCA after neutrophil preactivation. Furthermore, by comparison of amino acid and DNA sequences, the agreement was reached that PR3 was identical to AGP7, p29, and myeloblastin, described independently and involved in the control of growth and differentiation of leukemic cells. In addition to the two major ANCA antigens, a number of neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens recognized by ANCA have been previously identified (human leukocyte elastase [HLE], lactoferrin). It was established during the Third Workshop that these rare ANCA specificities, occurring in a limited number of patients, include a cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP57) and cathepsin G. However, the variety of ANCA antigen specificities contrasts with the fact that the vast majority of ANCA-positive sera are monospecific for a single ANCA antigen. Finally, the fine specificity of granulocyte-specific antinuclear antibodies (GS-ANA) occurring in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis is still unknown, but clearly a substantial proportion of GS-ANA belongs to the ANCA family.\r"

ANCA-associated vasculitides can be categorized into a number of distinctive clinicopathologic categories, eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary renal syndrome, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. At least the latter four syndromes can also be caused by other ANCA-negative immunopathogenic mechanisms, eg, immune complex deposition. Therefore, thorough diagnostic classification requires both an assessment of clinicopathologic category, as well as an assessment of immunopathologic category. Although different ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes have distinctive clinical and pathologic features, all ANCA-associated vasculitides share a number of common pathologic features, ie, focal distribution, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration. ANCA assays have very good sensitivity and specificity for ANCA-associated diseases, but the prevalence of these diseases in the patient population being analyzed must be taken into consideration when determining the predictive value of a test result. As with all serologic tests, ANCA results must be integrated with other clinical and pathologic data in order to reach the most accurate diagnostic conclusion.\r"

Rheumatic manifestations are an important clinical finding in systemic vasculitis, often preceding a fulminant course and sometimes imitating various rheumatic disorders. We analyzed the incidence of ANCA in rheumatic patients and looked for the frequency of rheumatic symptoms in systemic vasculitis. In WG (n = 186), we found rheumatic symptoms in 55% (myalgia, 45%; arthritis, 21%); in 90%, rheumatic complaints were associated with active vasculitis. In 730 patients with various rheumatic conditions (eg, 268 rheumatoid arthritis, 130 systemic lupus erythematosis [SLE], 32 sharp-S, 50 ankylosing spondylitis, 43 systemic sclerosis) no C-ANCA were found. On the contrary, the P-ANCA pattern was seen in seven of 62 giant cell arteritis, five of 27 Felty's/Still's syndrome, and four of 130 SLE patients in addition to renal vasculitis (21/74). We demonstrated that 95% of C-ANCA-positive sera react with proteinase 3 (PR3 or myeloblastin). Using monoclonal antibodies, we showed that PR3 is expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes; thus, PR3 autoantigens are accessible for circulating antibodies. The detection of ANCA in sera from vasculitis and other rheumatic diseases is of immunodiagnostic value and provides new insight in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitides.\r"

It is C-ANCA that has high specificity for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). The sensitivity is highest in the fully expressed Wegener's triad, or ELK, and less in local regional disease. It is possible that isolated manifestations such as episcleritis, subglottic stricture, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with C-ANCA may be considered in the Wegener's spectrum, although traditional histopathologic criteria are lacking. Until specific etiologic agents are uncovered for the various ANCA-associated entities, classification schemes should continue to employ previously established clinicopathologic syndromes such as WG using the ANCA test to better define their clinical spectrums.\r"

In vitro they can activate neutrophils and monocytes to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulate, and damage target cells. The antigens to which they are directed stimulate T lymphocytes from patients with these diseases. The ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) may also play a role in growth regulation of monocytes by inactivating the enzymatic function of its antigen.

Seven individuals with stable end-stage renal failure were dialyzed 4 hours, three times weekly. The effects of dialysates containing 1.75, 1.25, or 0.75 mmol/L (70.1, 50.1, or 30.1 mg/L) of calcium were compared. Each patient was studied once at each bath calcium concentration. Compared with the predialysis mean value of 2.27 mmol/L (9.1 mg/dL), plasma total calcium concentration increased, remained constant, or decreased with the 1.75-, 1.25-, or 0.75-mmol/L calcium dialysates, respectively. The 0.75-mmol/L calcium dialysate did not cause signs or symptoms of hypocalcemia (and the plasma calcium concentration did not fall below 1.80 mmol/L [7.2 mg/dL]). Plasma phosphorus concentrations decreased equally from a predialysis mean value of 2.16 mmol/L (6.7 mg/dL), regardless of the dialysate calcium concentration. After 4 hours of treatment with the three different dialysates, the cumulative calcium fluxes were significantly different. With 1.75 mmol/L calcium, mean bodily calcium accumulation was 21.9 mmol (879 mg). With 1.25 mmol/L, there was no net calcium flux. With 0.75 mmol/L, mean patient calcium loss was 5.8 mmol (231 mg). Mean phosphorus removal after 4 hours was 32.5 mmol (1,006 mg) and was unaffected by dialysate calcium concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent rifampin, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned 64 patients to receive either rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months or no treatment. The rifampin-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in rifampin-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in rifampin-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of rifampin in four patients. We conclude that intermittent rifampin administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population.\r"

O-81 Id and NE-1 Id activity were also detected on the renal eluate-derived IgG, but not IgM from the autopsy cases with lupus nephritis. The incidences of O-81 Id were not associated with histological features in the glomeruli, but the distribution patterns were similar to those of IgG deposits. Our study also showed that 65% to 70% of patients with IgG deposits either in the subendothelium or in the subepithelial area of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) showed positive tests for O-81 Id. It was also noted that most patients with massive proteinuria had O-81 Id in their glomeruli. It is concluded that O-81 Id deposits are relatively specific for active lupus nephritis and that immunofluorescence studies using anti-Id antibodies may be clinically useful for specifying the renal lesions of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of renal vascular lesions (RVL) and their relevance in the progression of renal damage were evaluated by the Pathology Group of the \"Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Nefrite Lupica\" (GISNEL). Of 285 patients with lupus nephritis collected from 20 nephrology centers in Italy and classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 79 cases (27.7%) with RVL were identified and classified as follows: (1) lupus vasculopathy (n = 27); (2) hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP) malignant hypertension-like lesions (n = 24); (3) vasculitis (n = 8); (4) arterio-arteriosclerosis (n = 20). At the time of renal biopsy, patients with RVL had mean serum creatinine levels significantly higher than patients without RVL (201.8 +/- 195.9 mumol/L [2.2 +/- 2.2 mg/dL] v 108.1 +/- 108.0 mumol/L [1.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dL]; P less than 0.01). Hypertension was more frequent in patients with RVL than in those without (68.4% v 30.5%; P less than 0.01). The probability of kidney survival assessed according to the Kaplan-Meier method at 5 and 10 years was, respectively, 74.3% +/- 5.9% and 58.0% +/- 8.9% in patients with RVL, compared with 89.6% +/- 2.7% and 85.9% +/- 3.7% in patients without RVL. However, the two groups did not differ significantly as regards overall survival, the probability of survival at 5 and 10 years being 86.5% +/- 4.5% and 78.8% +/- 6.6% in patients with RVL and 92.2% +/- 2.2% and 83.3% +/- 4.4% in patients without RVL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether nephrologists perceive disparities between the skills learned during fellowship training and those necessary for clinical subspecialty practice, we surveyed the perception of board-certified American nephrologists regarding the effectiveness of their clinical training. A questionnaire was sent to all Diplomates of the American Board of Internal Medicine in the subspecialty of Nephrology who successfully passed the qualifying examination in 1974, 1980, and 1986, regarding the effectiveness of academic instruction within the clinical fellowship program as regards traditional academic subject matter, patient management, performance of procedures, and interpretation of laboratory data. Questionnaires were returned by 42.1%. Although respondents were generally satisfied with training in academic nephrologic subject matter, dissatisfaction with training in pediatric nephrology, transplant immunology, nephrolithiasis, nutrition, and renal function and disease in pregnancy was evident. Training was thought to be ineffective in theoretical and practical aspects of management of end-stage renal disease. In addition, respondents were dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their training in interpretation of radiologic tests and procedures such as gaining access to the circulation. More recently trained nephrologists were dissatisfied with training in outpatient management and interpretation of radiographic tests. Differences between perceptions of older and younger nephrologists were most marked regarding their preparation for gaining access to the circulation, interpretation of intravenous pyelography, and training for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To prepare fellows in training for the exigencies of clinical practice. Nephrology training programs will have to emphasize the teaching of the cognitive and manual bases of performing procedures, and provide more outpatient experience for trainees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A boy and girl, both of East Indian descent, developed recurrent lung infiltrates from the age of 3 months and 2 years, respectively. Both subsequently presented with pulmonary hemorrhage, fever, arthritis, hematuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria at 1.5 and 6 years of age, respectively. Renal biopsy in each case showed acute, severe, focal and segmental, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis without immune deposits. Subsequent renal biopsies revealed severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. No vasculitis or granulomas were seen on renal, skin, or lung biopsies. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were not detected in sera taken 1.5 years in the boy and 3.5 years in the girl after the onset of renal disease. The boy was treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis, but developed progressive renal impairment and commenced dialysis within 4 years. Subsequent to renal transplantation, he developed an immunoblastic lymphoma and died. The girl was treated initially with prednisone and later with cyclophosphamide. After 4 years, she had a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). While necrotizing nonimmune glomerulonephritis associated with pulmonary hemorrhage is rare, and cases are characteristically difficult to classify because of many overlapping features, it is possible that these children had a unique illness.\r"

Treatment with prednisone, anticoagulation, antiplatelet drugs, splenectomy, exchange transfusions, vincristine, and plasmapheresis may be effective in some patients, but the response to these therapies is inconsistent and all carry the potential for serious side effects. We, and others, have recently seen dramatic responses to intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) when other treatments have failed. Although IV IgG is expensive, its costs are low compared with those extended plasmapheresis regimens. Since the response to treatment can usually be evaluated within a few days and the side effects appear less than with other treatments, we believe a strong case can be made for the use of IV IgG as first-line therapy for acute TTP. Continued multicenter studies are necessary to finally solve the problem of competing and confusing treatment attempts and synergism of treatment in acute TTP.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of renal water handling and the effects of altered hydration and posture on the osmoregulation of vasopressin release were performed on a chronically hyponatremic patient with complete cervical spinal cord transection at the C-5 level. Acute oral water loading studies showed marked reduction in free water clearance and urine diluting ability, despite appropriate suppression of plasma vasopressin concentrations. Orthostatic reductions in arterial blood pressure during head-up tilting and following the assumption of sitting posture were also demonstrable, and may have contributed to, but could not fully account for, the defect in renal water excretion, which persisted in supine posture. Hypertonic sodium chloride infusion studies performed before fluid restriction showed that low preinfusion plasma osmolality was associated with a reduced osmotic threshold for vasopressin release, which was subsequently corrected by a period of fluid restriction that restored the patient's plasma osmolality to a normal level. This shift in osmotic threshold can be inferred from both linear regression and log-linear regression analysis of the data. These studies show that marked impairment of renal water excretion coupled with unrestricted water intake can result in altered osmoregulation of vasopressin release in association with persistent plasma hypo-osmolality, which can be corrected by fluid restriction.\r"

Forty-one paternally derived 47,XXYs and their parents were tested at six polymorphic loci spanning the pseudoautosomal region. We were able to detect crossing-over in only six of 39 cases informative for the telomeric DXYS14/DXYS20 locus. Subsequently, we used the data to generate a genetic linkage map of the pseudoautosomal region and found it to be significantly shorter than the normal male map of the region. From these analyses we conclude that most paternally derived 47,XXYs result from meiosis in which the X and Y chromosomes did not recombine.\r"

Distal Xp contains the pseudoautosomal region, a number of disease loci, and several cell-surface markers. Several genes in this area have also been observed to escape X-chromosomal inactivation. The characterization of new polymorphic loci in this region has permitted the construction of a refined multipoint linkage map extending 15 cM from the Xp telomere. This interval is known to contain the loci for the diseases X-linked ichthyosis, chondrodysplasia punctata, and Kallmann syndrome, as well as the cell-surface markers Xg and 12E7. This region also contains the junction between the pseudoautosomal region and strictly X-linked sequences. The locus MIC2 has been demonstrated by linkage analysis to be indistinguishable from the pseudoautosomal junction. The steroid sulfatase locus has been mapped to an interval adjacent to the DXS278 locus and 6 cM from the pseudoautosomal junction. The polymorphic locus (STS) DXS278 was shown to be informative in all families studied, and linkage analysis reveals that the locus represents a low-copy repeat with at least one copy distal to the STS gene. The generation of a multipoint linkage map of distal Xp will be useful in the genetic dissection of many of the unique features of this region.\r"

A number of studies have used classical linkage analysis in families to map this region. Here, we use mutant human T-lymphocyte clones known to be deleted for all or part of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) gene, to order anonymous probes known to map to Xq26. Fifty-seven T-cell clones were studied, including 44 derived from in vivo mutation and 13 from in vitro irradiated T-lymphocyte cultures. Twenty anonymous probes (DXS10, DXS11, DXS19, DXS37, DXS42, DXS51, DXS53, DXS59, DXS79, DXS86, DXS92, DXS99, DXS100d, DXS102, DXS107, DXS144, DXS172, DXS174, DXS177, and DNF1) were tested for codeletion with the hprt gene by Southern blotting methods. Five of these probes (DXS10, DXS53, DXS79, DXS86 and DXS177) showed codeletion with hprt in some mutants. The mutants established the following unambiguous ordering of the probes relative to the hprt gene: DXS53-DXS79-5'hprt3'-DXS86-DXS10-DXS177 . The centromere appears to map proximal to DXS53. These mappings order several closely linked but previously unordered probes. In addition, these studies indicate that rather large deletions of the functionally haploid X chromosome can occur while still retaining T-cell viability.\r"

In this study, the neuroanatomy of the posterior fossa and other selected CNS regions in 12 young fra X females were compared with those of a group of 12 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched females without evidence of the fra X syndrome. Fra X females were shown to have decreased size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and increased size of the fourth ventricle, findings that are identical to those previously reported for fra X males. When compared with fra X male and nonfra X control groups, the distribution of the posterior-vermis and fourth-ventricle variables for the fra X female group was intermediate. These results support the hypothesis that the fra X genetic abnormality leads to hypoplasia of the posterior cerebellar vermis, a neuroanatomical variation of potential importance to both developmental and neuropsychiatric syndromes.\r"

The product can be visualized on native minigels by ethidium staining and directly sequenced after gel purification. We have used this system to analyze the structures of PBL dystrophin mRNA in 26 Duchenne, Becker, or intermediate muscular dystrophy patients who have gross rearrangements of the dystrophin gene. In each case, the effect that the genomic rearrangement has on the structure of the transcript--and, by inference, on the dystrophin protein--has been determined, and the results confirm the frameshift hypothesis. The study also identifies a series of alternatively spliced transcripts which are specific to the rearranged genotypes and which seem therefore to arise following the alteration in the context of the splice signal. The system has been used for unambiguous identification of carrier females. Furthermore, the rapid production of microgram quantities of dystrophin cDNA from a readily accessible tissue makes point-mutation screening a practical proposition.\r"

  ".U": "91328136\r", 
  ".W": "Indirect tracking of mutation by DNA polymorphisms is still essential for carrier and prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, at least in the families where no deletion can be detected. Because of the relatively high level of intragenic recombination, informative and easily testable markers at both ends of the gene are necessary for efficient and accurate diagnosis. We report the characterization of two polymorphic microsatellite sequences (TG repeats) at the 5' end of the dystrophin gene, within 40 kb of the muscle-specific promoter. The most useful one (5' DYS MSA) has 10 alleles with a 57% heterozygosity and can be tested on small polyacrylamide gels in a nonradioactive PCR-based assay. Despite its large number of alleles, this microsatellite shows strong linkage disequilibrium with a two-allele polymorphism reported by Roberts et al., an indication of the stability of this type of sequences. We have used the new microsatellites at the 5' end, along with one we reported previously for the 3' end, to type the families in the CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) panel. While the number of informative families has increased by a factor of about two with respect to the study of Abbs et al., the estimates of the recombination fractions are in good agreement with this previous report, suggesting a 11% recombination across the gene (3% between the 5' end and the pERT87 region, 8% between pERT87 and the 3' end), which is about fivefold more than expected. However, these estimates still have wide confidence limits.\r"

  ".W": "Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct genetic disorders, Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar. However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15. This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (genetic imprinting). No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region. We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region. Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions. Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation. The localization of this receptor gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes.\r"

The major apo E types in all populations were E3/2 (frequency range from 7.0% in Indians to 16.9% in Malays), E3/3 (frequency range from 39.8% in Sudanese to 72.1% in Japanese), and E3/4 (frequency range from 11.3% in Japanese to 35.9% in Sudanese). Mean cholesterol levels ranged from 144.2 mg/dl in the Sudanese to 228.5 mg/dl in the Icelandics. Two-way analysis of variance of the effect of population and apo E type on cholesterol levels showed no significantly interaction effect, indicating that the effects of apo E type on cholesterol levels do not differ significantly among the populations. The overall average excess for the epsilon 2 allele was -14.12 mg/dl (range -31.63 to -8.82 mg/dl); for the epsilon 3 allele, 0.04 mg/dl (range -1.87 to 1.58 mg/dl; and for the epsilon 4 allele, 8.14 mg/dl (range -1.71 to 13.31 mg/dl). Despite the apparent heterogeneity in these values, especially for the epsilon 4 allele, comparison of the average excesses by a method of repeated sampling with random permutations revealed no significant difference in effects among populations. These data indicate that a given apo E allele acts in a relatively uniform manner in different populations despite differences in genetic background and environmental factors.\r"

Most familial forms of ITD display autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance. Linkage analysis has been previously used to localize a dystonia gene to the 9q32-34 region in a large non-Jewish family and in a group of Ashkenazi Jewish families. Utilizing GT repeat polymorphisms from this region, here we demonstrate that the gene causing dystonia in Ashkenazi Jews can be localized to the 11-cM interval between AK1 and D9S10. Linkage analysis in the non-Jewish family is also consistent with occurrence of the gene in this region, although positive lod scores extend over a greater than 20-cM interval in that family. These results set the stage for positional cloning of the dystonia gene. Currently there are no known candidate genes in this region.\r"

We have begun a study of the genetics of this enzyme activity. Complex segregation analysis of basal (unstimulated) platelet adenylate cyclase activity in families reveals a mode of inheritance that cannot be accounted for by a simple mixed model of transmission. By contrast, adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by fluoride ion reveals a single major locus effect with a modest multifactorial background. These results suggest that a single factor in the second-messenger pathway may (a) account for the majority of individual differences in stimulation of adenylate cyclase of fluoride and (b) help explain the reduced activities previously observed in alcoholics.\r"

Using an independent clone, we have demonstrated close genetic linkage between an NaCh gene and the HYPP locus in another family. With physiological data demonstrating abnormal NaCh function in HYPP patients, the absence of any obligate recombinations in the two families strengthens the argument that this NaCh gene is the site of the defect in this disorder.\r"

Two biochemically distinct forms of the enzyme, A and B, are encoded in separate genes on the human X chromosome. In these studies we investigated the role of the structural gene for MAO-A in determining levels of activity in humans, as measured in cultured skin fibroblasts. The coding sequence of the mRNA for MAO-A was determined by first-strand cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and direct dideoxy sequencing. Two single-basepair substitutions were observed in cDNAs from cells with a 30-fold difference in activity levels. These two substitutions were in the third base of a triplet codon and hence did not affect the deduced amino acid sequence but did affect the presence or absence of restriction-enzyme sites for EcoRV and Fnu4HI, which could be elucidated on PCR fragments derived from genomic DNA or cDNAs. A third polymorphism for MspI in the noncoding region of the MAOA gene was also evaluated by Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA. Statistically significant associations were observed between the alleles for MAOA and levels of MAO activity in human male fibroblast lines. This association indicates that the MAOA gene itself is a major determinant of activity levels, apparently, in part, through noncoding, regulatory elements.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) results from defective hydroxylation of phenylalanine in the liver, in most cases because of defective phenylalanine hydroxylase. HPA is highly variable, ranging from moderate elevation of plasma phenylalanine with no clinical consequences to a severe disease, classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Non-PKU HPA was found in excess of PKU in Israel, while the opposite is true in Europe. To study the genetic basis of non-PKU HPA, we performed haplotype analysis at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in 27 families with non-PKU HPA. All individuals with this condition were compound heterozygotes. In six of these families, in which both PKU and non-PKU HPA were segregating, haplotype analysis showed that non-PKU HPA resulted from compound heterozygosity for a PKU mutation and a second mutation, with milder effect, which is probably expressed only when it interacts with the severe mutation. The involvement of PKU mutations in non-PKU HPA was further demonstrated in Jewish Yemenite families with non-PKU HPA, in which the individuals with this condition were carriers of the single PKU allele which exists in this community. In addition, two previously known PKU point mutations (R261Q and R408W) were found in individuals with non-PKU HPA. These mutations are associated, in our population, with the same haplotypes as those with which it is associated in Europe. Based on the above-mentioned genetic model for non-PKU HPA, successful prenatal diagnosis of this condition was performed in one family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A child affected by the type VII form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VII) was shown to have a heterozygous structural defect in the amino-terminus of pro-alpha 1(I) collagen. As a result, type I procollagen trimers containing defective subunits are not converted to mature collagen molecules. To identify the cause of the protein abnormality, specifically primed cDNAs and genomic DNA were PCR amplified and sequenced. This analysis disclosed that the protein structural defect is caused by a single base substitution (A for G) at position -1 of the splice donor site of intron 6 of the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene (COL1A1). The affected allele produces (a) transcripts lacking exon 6 sequences and (b), in lesser amount, normally spliced transcripts. Furthermore, the rate of exon 6 skipping is temperature dependent, for it appears to decrease substantially when the patient's fibroblasts are incubated at 31 degrees C. These findings are similar to those we previously reported for other unrelated EDS VII cases and, therefore, reemphasize the molecular homogeneity of this rare connective tissue disorder.\r"

Homozygosity for the pseudodeficiency allele is associated with low arylsulfatase A activity but does not cause a disease. Analysis of the arylsulfatase A gene in this patient revealed a C----T transition in exon 2, causing a Ser 96----Phe substitution in addition to the sequence alterations causing arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency. Although this mutation was found only in 1 of 78 metachromatic leukodystrophy patients tested, five more patients were identified who seemed hetero- or homozygous for the pseudodeficiency allele. The existence of nonfunctional arylsulfatase A alleles derived from the pseudodeficiency allele calls for caution when the diagnosis of arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency is based solely on the identification of the mutations characterizing the pseudodeficiency allele.\r"

One mutation is a single base deletion which causes a frameshift and which is expected to result in the synthesis of a truncated protein. Two other mutations consist of single base substitutions and lead to amino acid changes. The fourth mutation is a single base substitution producing an aberrant splicing and resulting in an mRNA which would encode a protein missing three amino acids. DNAs from 16 unrelated CRIM-negative AIP patients were screened for the presence of these four mutations, by hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for each of the mutations, but none of the four mutations was identified in additional patients. The results indicate that mutations responsible for CRIM-negative AIP are highly heterogenous.\r"

Sequencing of the amplified cDNAs disclosed at codon 393 of the mature E1 alpha polypeptide a base substitution changing a tyrosine (encoded by TAC) to an asparagine residue (encoded by AAC), which is designated Y393N. A segment of the E1 alpha gene containing the 5' portion of exon 9 was amplified. Probing of the amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the mutation in the E1 alpha gene was homozygous in six Mennonites affected with classical MSUD and was present in heterozygous carriers. The identification of the MSUD mutation in the Philadelphia Mennonites will facilitate diagnosis and carrier detection for this population.\r"

Sixty four percent (16/25) of the Ashkenazi patients who carry this mutant allele were of Lithuanian origin. The mutation was not found in 47 non-Ashkenazi FH families. This mutation was prevalent (8/10 FH cases) in the Jewish community in South Africa, which originated mainly from Lithuania. The mutation, a 3-bp in-frame deletion that would result in the elimination of Gly197, has been previously designated FH-Piscataway. PCR amplification of a DNA fragment that includes the mutation in heterozygous individuals results in the formation of a heteroduplex that can be demonstrated by PAGE and used for molecular diagnosis.\r"
